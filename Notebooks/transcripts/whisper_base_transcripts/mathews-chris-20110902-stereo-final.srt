1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So if you would just start by introducing yourself to Snow, your name and date date and

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where we got, I know.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm Christopher Matthews.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today is September 2nd, 2011 and we're in the Valley Memorial Library.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, first of all, where are you born and what are you up?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,480
I was born in 1937 in New York City and my father was about to start a medical practice in

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,759
the Bridgeport, Connecticut.

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,399
So we moved from New York very early.

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,120
He was stationed with a Navy during the war on a variety of places and moved to Seattle in

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:58,359
1944 and the family moved with him after my family moved back to Connecticut again, but

14
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,479
after three years they realized they'd made a big mistake leaving the West Coast.

15
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,359
So we moved to Olympia in 1949 and that's what I consider my hometown.

16
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,359
But what's some of your hobbies when you're growing up?

17
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,359
Well, it's pretty interesting science obviously.

18
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,719
I had a chemistry set and my friends and I used to make rockets and fire them off.

19
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:28,200
And it became interested in birding a nature study because my grandfather was a professional

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,040
ornithologist who was cured of birds at the American Museum of Natural History in New

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
York.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,120
So we had, we were very much exposed to natural history all my life.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,240
And that's kept on.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,159
I was president of the Autobahn Society of Corp.

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
Allows for three years.

26
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,920
So there was a strong family influence in the scientific and the fact that I understand

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,799
where that early interest in science came from?

28
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,799
Right.

29
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,799
You're family.

30
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,799
Right.

31
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,240
Well, yes, my grandfather of course was an ornithologist and a very broadly based biologist.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,120
My father was a physician and his father was a surgeon.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:24,039
So there wasn't, well, let's say there was both medical and scientific achievement in

34
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,039
our background.

35
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,020
And people who does natural, I guess, for me to have a career in science, although I

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,040
did consider medicine pretty strongly at various times.

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
My mother?

38
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,919
She has a degree from Vassar in English and actually dramatic production.

39
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,959
And she never got involved in science, but she obviously encouraged what my brother

40
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,680
and my sisters and I did.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,199
My brother ended up as a wildlife biologist and retired a few years ago from the University

42
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,680
of Washington faculty in the College of Fisheries.

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,920
My sisters are all younger and they, two of them finished college, but they finished

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,520
in their 30s.

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,480
My parents went through a fairly messy divorce when my sisters were teenagers and I think

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,520
this kept them from being motivated to go through college, but they were all very bright

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,920
and they went back.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
And they had achieved quite a lot actually.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,120
My youngest sister, among other things, has published three books, one of which was

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,960
described her experience as the winner of the Pillsbury Bake Off in 1998, with a $1 million

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
prize.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
It's a very readable book.

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Very interesting.

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,319
So outside of your family, where there are other scientific mentors or influences in your

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,319
life, every child?

56
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,560
I guess so.

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,159
I hadn't thought very much about that, but not so much toward the hard science.

58
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:16,639
In fact, the chemistry course that I took in high school was probably my least favorite

59
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,959
course.

60
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,539
Although the teacher, Mr. Gaines, was my merit badge counselor when I got the chemistry

61
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,600
merit badge in Boy Scout.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,680
This is my freshman year in high school and he told me I shouldn't try for it until I

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,400
was a junior and had taken chemistry and he helped me through it.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,519
But he wasn't a very good teacher.

65
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:47,879
The botany teacher, Mr. Burke also, and the physics teacher, Mr. Keller, none of them

66
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,600
I thought were particularly good teachers, but there was enough interest in what I was

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
doing and that I guess that provided some motivation.

68
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
So you were scouting with something to be involved in?

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Yes.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,560
When we moved to Olympia, we lived in the right in town, actually about two blocks from the

71
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,399
state capital building and it was very easy to be in Boy Scouts and my parents bought

72
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:21,000
some waterfront land about seven miles out of town and we moved there to a house that

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,279
they built in my freshman year.

74
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,359
And it became much more difficult to be involved in scouting after that.

75
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:34,279
So although I always wanted to be an eagle scout, I just drifted out of it.

76
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,479
How would you characterize the rest of your high school experience?

77
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,759
That's an interesting question too.

78
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,439
I had to skip the second grade so I was younger and smaller than most of my classmates

79
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:55,519
and it took me a while to catch up socially, but I worked pretty hard at it and ended

80
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,279
up with a very nice group of friends.

81
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:05,240
I thought that educationally the high school experience was pretty mediocre, but maybe

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
I was too hard on it.

83
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,600
I worked pretty hard and obviously did pretty well.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,320
My daughter managed to make it through Corvallis High in three years and when I thought back

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,280
on my high school experience, maybe that would have been good, but then I would have been

86
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,920
two years ahead and the catching up socially would have been that much more difficult.

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Any sports in the Anthropocies?

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,920
I've never been very athletic but I've enjoyed doing things.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I've been a seed cross-country skied and I jog regularly and you wouldn't call that

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,280
athletics, but it's keeping in shape.

91
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,759
Played a little tennis but it never was very good as much of anything in a way of sports.

92
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,120
Okay, so after high school you went to read college?

93
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,840
How did you decide to go to the...

94
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:10,719
I was reading an article on the Saturday evening post in 1952, my junior year in high school

95
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:16,079
and there was an article by Richard Newberger who later became a senator from Oregon and

96
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,079
the title of the article was The School for Bright Young Things.

97
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,919
I guess that's sort of what I perceived myself as and I'd never heard of where he called

98
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,120
before even though he lived just 120 miles away from Portland.

99
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,160
It looked like a pretty exciting place and it seemed as though it would be right for

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,680
me and so I applied to read and I applied to Stanford and of course it was accepted both

101
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,360
places and read just seemed much more convenient and it was more affordable.

102
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,480
Quite a different... quite a distinction between the two alternatives because our son eventually

103
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
went to Stanford so I learned a lot more about it.

104
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,480
I assume that you mentioned being some of this aspect of the academic high school read

105
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,879
probably presented a different sort of new version.

106
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:15,160
Yeah, actually three of us from my graduate class went to read and one of them only made

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
it two years.

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,160
The other one who'd been a very strong science student ended up majoring in philosophy

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,920
and going to law school and also becoming an extremely accomplished folk musician.

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
He and his wife basically made their living.

111
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,120
So read was interesting in terms of the fact that a lot of people went there moving in

112
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,320
one direction and changed directions completely or undirected them and getting a direction.

113
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,240
There was also a very high attrition rate then so there were a number of students that

114
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,840
went there undirected and there wasn't much supervision and so a number of students

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,200
had dropped out and I was one of the ones who had a sort of vague idea of what I wanted

116
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,480
to do and basically stayed with it.

117
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,879
What was the climate like in the day?

118
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,600
I suppose pretty much like it is today.

119
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,879
It was pretty intense intellectually but the students knew how to do it however good time

120
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,360
as well.

121
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,560
The academic environment was very strong.

122
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:33,200
The courses in liberal arts and social science all had a very heavy writing component.

123
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,320
So in the freshman humanities course we had to write a paper every week and then we had

124
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,560
an individual conference about every paper with the instructor.

125
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:51,919
So anything any credit I can take for my ability to write today I order e-college and

126
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,000
the science was very strong also.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,399
At that time in the early mid-50s I would say that the science wasn't as strong as it

128
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,519
is currently.

129
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,559
Read like many of the other high quality undergraduate colleges has really made a push for a stronger

130
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,679
research orientation in the science faculty and although we were all required to write

131
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:23,319
a thesis when I was a student I would say the thesis worked all cutting-edge science

132
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,159
but put it that way.

133
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,919
In fact one of my regrets about read was that I probably took more science than I really

134
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:40,479
needed to and I should have taken more courses in liberal arts philosophy and literature

135
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:47,679
and social sciences than I did but I ended up with the interest in a lot of different

136
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,919
areas and I learned a lot of things through my own reading and that's what college is

137
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,879
supposed to be for anyway I think.

138
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:01,759
How would you say you're assigned as a dentist developer than the graduate?

139
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:09,519
Well I went there as a chemistry major because probably because of my interest that started

140
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,919
with the reading about chemistry and playing with chemistry sets and so forth so it was

141
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:23,559
sort of an unfocused interest but at some point I read a science fiction anthology of short

142
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:35,519
stories and the stories were grouped by a scientific area that the science fiction dealt with and

143
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,959
so there were two or three stories that were listed under biochemistry and I never heard

144
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,639
of biochemistry before and I thought hey the idea of chemistry that has something to do

145
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,799
with biology I'm going to have to read these stories and I enjoyed them and so my junior

146
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:58,959
year I took a biochemistry course and the reading I did both in class and auto class convinced

147
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,279
me that this was a pretty exciting area to go into.

148
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,959
During my sophomore year I'd wrestle with the idea of going to medical school.

149
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,120
I had a hard time with organic chemistry the first term of it and the first in the fall

150
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,159
term of my sophomore year and I'd like to tell medical students or pre-medical students

151
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,159
this story.

152
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,440
I began to wonder if I was bright enough to go into science and maybe I should go into

153
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,360
medicine instead but then the second semester or the main course for majors was quantitative

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,240
analysis and I did much better and at the end of the year I decided I was bright enough

155
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,480
to go into science after all.

156
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,440
What's it have or you're reading or maybe even your high school you told me a story

157
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,480
about a letter that you are doing very well and it's falling?

158
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,399
I first heard of Linus Pauling the fall semester of my freshman year in chemistry class one

159
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,600
day there was a student who raised his hand to ask a question and he said oh professor

160
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,279
does what you're talking about have anything to do with the Pauling theory of resonance

161
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,039
and professor Lumeur gave him a very respectful answer and I thought to myself I've never

162
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,919
heard of Pauling but I guess I'd better learn something about this guy and then remarkably

163
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,399
enough within the next two or three weeks it was announced that Linus Pauling had won

164
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,959
the Nobel Prize in chemistry so I realized that this student was a little bit ahead of

165
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,559
me in terms of knowing major scientific themes.

166
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,559
You've been a letter letter in there and that's fine?

167
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,159
Right I guess you and I talked about that a few years ago you want me to describe that

168
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:53,359
for the Oregonian published an editorial a day or two after the Nobel Prize was announced

169
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:59,119
and it was basically congratulations to a native son of Oregon who went on and achieved

170
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:07,120
the great things and won the Nobel Prize but wasn't it the same about his inaccurate thinking

171
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,919
and his political association that had led him to have his passport lifted and I thought

172
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,080
it was pretty inappropriate to bring these political things into at a time when we should

173
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,120
be celebrating this person's intellectual triumph and so I wrote my first letter to the

174
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,240
editor ever and at that time Reed College was in very bad odor in the Portland area

175
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,240
because the Velley Committee which was the House on American Activities Committee had

176
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,120
toured the country in the spring or just before I started college and three members of the

177
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,080
Reed faculty were interviewed and refused to discuss their associations and this made

178
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,080
a lot of people think that Reed was full of confidence so when I wrote the letter to the

179
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,600
editor I used my home address from the look here which could be seen as being within the

180
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:16,080
readership area of the Oregonian and then I guess I clipped the editorial and my letter

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,360
and mailed them home to my mother and because my grandparents knew the Paulings my grandfather

182
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,840
was a member of the American Philosophical Society which Pauling was also my mother mailed this

183
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,759
to my grandmother and my grandmother mailed it to Pauling and Pauling eventually sent me

184
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,320
a nice short note which pleased me a great deal Pauling's youngest son and Craylon was a

185
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,440
classmate of mine at Reed and then later on when I was a graduate student at the University of

186
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Washington and my wife was a graduate student in genetics Craylon Pauling was doing his

187
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,120
graduate work in genetics also so Cate and Craylon worked in the same lab and we used to see them

188
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:10,000
socially fairly frequently so somehow or another I had a fairly close series of relationships

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:24,480
with the Pauling family. I'm sorry? Yeah he was pretty immature and he had a great sense of

190
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:33,360
humor he seemed to enjoy life a lot he started as a chemistry major at Reed and he didn't do

191
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,799
very well so he switched to biology and it took him five years to graduate so he started

192
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,240
graduate school at UW a year after I had and then I think it took him five or six years to finish

193
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:54,000
his PhD but he actually published some fairly important papers from his postdoc and then later on

194
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,120
when he was on the faculty at San Francisco State as far as I remember right he was he was chair

195
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,440
of the biology department there for quite a few years and so he was always a very likeable fellow

196
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:18,559
and he was unsubbatical here in 1980 and 81 he worked with Dick Morita in the microbiology

197
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,320
department and his then second wife K Pauling worked in our department as a postdoc with one of

198
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,320
my colleagues so we reestablished contact down it was very pleasant. I didn't know anything.

199
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,399
Well there was kind of an amusing this doesn't have anything to do with college

200
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:44,639
era but during that year that that Krell and Pauling was here I was called upon to be the

201
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,839
organizers of the what used to be the annual biology colloquial I'm not even sure if that's

202
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,879
still held so I organized the two-day meeting on the on the organization and manipulation of

203
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,280
genetic information this is 1981 and we had a party for the speakers and the people who

204
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,560
were participating and the president McVickire was at the party and he came up to me and he said

205
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
Chris I'd like to have you introduce me to to winus Pauling Sun so I took him over and introduced

206
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,120
him to Krell and he backed Krell and into a corner and wouldn't let him out and they were

207
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,240
talking there for probably 20 minutes I was trying to think of a way that I could rescue Krell and

208
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Sun but it didn't work. So did you have any mind? With

209
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,120
the line of spalling? Yes probably the first time I met him

210
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:48,559
he came to Seattle for a lecture and I met him there so that would have been in 1961

211
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:57,279
when I was a student but then my first month here I started my employment as chairman of

212
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,799
biochemistry and biophysics in January 1978 and one of the first things I learned in my first

213
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,240
week on the job was that I had to get ready for site visit for our department because the

214
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,799
legislature in the previous year had had made some sort of a budget note or order of some kind

215
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:25,279
that there should be reviews of academic programs that might involve duplication between Oregon

216
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,000
state and the U of O and although the U of O didn't have a biochemistry department they had the

217
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,559
institute of molecular biology and they had a biology department and a chemistry department so

218
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,960
chemistry and biochemistry were getting reviewed and Linus Pauling was one of the outside reviewers

219
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:50,960
that was brought in and it was fairly intimidating so I had to prepare for a day long site visit

220
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,840
I've forgotten who the other reviewers were and then we had a similar experience we were

221
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:08,319
site visit as a biology department as well so I had to organize two site visits and I remember

222
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:15,839
the biology site visit one of the one of the site visitors was Herschel Roman who was professor

223
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:23,519
genetics at the UW and he's the one that my wife worked for and one of the other site visitors

224
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,279
was a guy named Gordon Lark who was at Kansas State University who's quite a prominent bacterial

225
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,439
geneticist and when he met with me early in the morning he said Chris why did you move here anyway

226
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:46,240
and it's sort of a sort of a wondering what the what the deal was what was the attraction

227
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
because I had a pretty good job at the University of Arizona before I moved here

228
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,000
and then later in the day when I met with him again and they'd had a chance to talk a lot

229
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,720
of the people and learn about Oregon State he said you don't have to answer me anymore he said

230
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,600
now I know why you moved here so I felt pretty good about the decision I had made to move

231
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,720
when that happened that gets over away from Linus Pauling but I met him two or three times

232
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,400
when he when he came to the campus either for the annual award of the Pauling Medal

233
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,799
or for other other things somehow we were brought into contact so I probably met him half

234
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:32,159
dozen times did I ever tell you the story about Pauling on the joke that he told at the Pauling

235
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,519
do you want to hear that it gets a little bit out of the chronology so the three north western

236
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,960
sections of the American account for society given the Linus Pauling Medal every year

237
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:53,119
and jointly and there's symposium on a banquet and the the the locale moves around from

238
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:02,079
Corvallos to Seattle to Pullman Washington or wherever and in the fall of 1979 it was held here

239
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:10,879
and so Pauling used to come to all these and after the banquet then he would give a little talk

240
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:15,919
about what he'd been doing during the previous year these things were always hugely entertaining

241
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,639
and so the talk of the day of the 1979 and Mrs. Pauling was with him she was still alive then

242
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:30,479
he said that he was encountering a lot of skepticism about vitamin C and the reporter was interviewing

243
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:36,639
I mean he said now Professor Pauling you take vitamin C don't you and well of course I do

244
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:45,359
young man well then sir do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your state of vigor no go

245
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:53,599
right ahead well sir can you tell me then please when did you have your last sexual experience

246
00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:01,359
well I looked at him and I said why 1956 and he said well that's terrible you know I said

247
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
what's so terrible about it you know you look at his watch and say it's only 2210 now

248
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:23,680
okay well we mentioned Washington and Man Seattle how do you make this decision to go to

249
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:34,800
the country okay that's a good question too in the in the summer of 1957 I went back to visit my

250
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,559
grandparents in Long Island and they were very interested in having me go to graduate school in the

251
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:49,599
East Coast so they took me to visit various schools Harvard and Brown and John's Hopkins but one

252
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,159
thing that I did since they lived fairly far out on the island they'd arranged a visit for me at

253
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,639
Brookhaven National Laboratory and I met with a biochemist there named Robert Steele and he told

254
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,040
me about what he was doing and he said I don't know why you're looking at all of these

255
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,600
graduate schools in the East Coast when one of the best graduate schools in the country is right

256
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,680
out for your living I said what's that and he said well the University of Washington it's a new

257
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,480
department but it's really good so I figured well like I said better look at it and so I ended up

258
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,080
applying to vertically John's Hopkins and the University of Washington and in those days

259
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:38,159
1954 no excuse me 57 58 you didn't get flown the departments to be interviewed at their expense

260
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,679
I had visited John's Hopkins I never did go down to the Cal but I was home for the weekend and

261
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
drove up to Seattle and the department was small it had just seven faculty members but they were

262
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:58,320
really nice and they and they represented a nice cross section of the biochemist through that

263
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:07,279
era and they all had good records of academic achievement and you know it was pretty close to my

264
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:15,440
family all living in the state of Washington at the time and so I figured why not and worked out

265
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:29,519
pretty well well I was pretty on focus when I began graduate school I when one my fellow students

266
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,320
would ask me what are you interested in I'd scratch my head and I'd say well I guess I'm

267
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,720
interested in enzymes but I'd like to do some project in enzymes that has potential applications

268
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,759
in medicine or biology what have you and so we were required to talk to all the faculty

269
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,680
about their research and Frank Honeckins was doing work on folate and simology so folate is one

270
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:05,440
of the B vitamins and it's converted to a coenzyme tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate is a

271
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:13,920
coenzyme that mobilizes single carbon functional groups and so these are involved in methylation

272
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:21,920
for example methylation of DNA methylation of certain amino acids and proteins and also the

273
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:29,920
methyl group of thymine nucleotides that get into DNA and the Honeckins laboratory had just recently

274
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:39,759
shown that that the action of methotrexate which is a folate analogue used in cancer treatment

275
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,320
he was discovered in the 1940s it's a very potent adylychemic agent that had acted by inhibiting

276
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,120
an enzyme called dihydrofolate productase that reduces folate to tetrahydrofolate and I thought

277
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,440
this was really interesting there wasn't very much known about the enzyme at the time but the fact

278
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,960
that the enzyme was a target for a very effective drug meant that the this whole area of folate

279
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,840
enzymology had the kind of protein enzyme focus that I was interested in with potential

280
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,120
applications of significant stymetres and so so I went to work with the with Frank Honeckins

281
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:22,080
and it worked out pretty well for me he was one major professor one of the other reasons that I

282
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:28,399
was interested in his lab was that I learned that he'd had several students who'd managed to

283
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:35,439
finish their PhDs and fairly short order and I was interested in getting my PhD and moving on

284
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,919
and that worked out pretty well too uncompleted by PhD requirements in a little under three and a half

285
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,279
years which is pretty fast by by today's standards where PhD had generally a five-year program or

286
00:27:51,279 --> 00:28:00,559
so well as you when you were at the University of Washington working at PhDs you got many.

287
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,839
That's what you got married that's what you're asking?

288
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah that's an interesting one too because my wife was a graduate school classmate in biochemistry

289
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,120
there were 12 entering students in the class of the entering class of 1958 and we ended up as

290
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:31,840
lab partners in the lab course and then later in the year as teaching assistants we were assigned

291
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:40,000
together to the to the reagent room that was called the solution room making up reagents for the

292
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,880
biochemistry lab class for dental students and we were supposed to put in 10 hours a week

293
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,680
effort in our TA duties and we worked pretty efficiently together so I think maybe we worked two or

294
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,280
three hours each per week and we didn't see each other socially at all at the time she had a

295
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,560
bunch of other boyfriends and I think we both had the feeling that you didn't get involved with people

296
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:13,360
that you saw every day but her interests were more biological and the genetics department was

297
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,559
founded in the spring of 1959 so she transferred to genetics so in our second year

298
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:28,159
when we were not seeing each other every day it became a little bit more natural and so we got married

299
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,159
in the spring of the early summer of 1960 and it's kind of interesting because Kate grew up in

300
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:42,159
Berkeley her mother was a research technician in the virus lab she worked for Wendell Stanley who

301
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,519
wanted a Nobel Prize for his work in tobacco mosaic virus and at Berkeley the virus lab and the

302
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:56,800
biochemistry department were in the same building at the time and Kate's mother tended to mother all the

303
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:04,800
graduate students who were unattached so if I'd gone to Cal as a graduate student we've always wondered

304
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,960
whether whether Elsa would have sort of the mothered million picked me out of someone suitable for

305
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,279
her daughter and would have got us together and we had a laugh over that over the years but

306
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,960
you can only live one life at a time. He also had your first child as a doctor on 28.

307
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Right that wasn't planned. Lawrence was born maybe nine and a half months after we got married

308
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,360
and the drank champagne from a glass on our first wedding anniversary and so Kate never finished her

309
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:49,839
PhD and she claims I had various times I encouraged her to do it she worked as a lab technician

310
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,679
and she also worked when I was at Yale she worked as a as a teaching assistant in the

311
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,679
department of biology where I was and she always claimed that she really didn't want a PhD anyway

312
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,479
she loves working in a lab and she's pretty good at it but she says she's good at the tactics but not

313
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,240
so good at the strategy at developing a long range line of research and a lot of learning for

314
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,319
funding and that sort of things so I think she's pretty happy with the kind of careers she had.

315
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,360
Was it difficult to sort of maintain an household and also be sort of related to a

316
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,839
program recently? Yeah well somehow it worked.

317
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,799
I a lot of my fellow students would go back

318
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,799
to work in a lab in the evening and I just stay home and Kate was very good about

319
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
after Lawrence was born about seeing that I had a couple of quiet hours every

320
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,159
every evening and I don't remember what's sitting around you but she was still working as a

321
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,519
graduate student in the teaching assistant in the genetics department somehow it seemed to work.

322
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:09,919
Okay so you finished up your PhD and you did a post-doc and

323
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:19,200
you know I wrote a bit about that? Yeah by the time I was approaching finishing my PhD

324
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,159
I knew that I wanted to work in a biological system that had more potential for genetics. I was

325
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,919
getting more involved in the biological side of insomology than the chemical or biophysical side

326
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,759
and reading the literature. I selected three people whose work I was interested in

327
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,599
and I wanted to be able to go to a lab where the specific experience that I'd had of the graduate

328
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:56,079
student would be useful and so Seymour Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania was the one I eventually

329
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,559
settled on and he was working on bacteria phases, bacterial viruses and basically in the late

330
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,799
1940s when he started with his own lab he'd done what I would call the first biochemical experiments

331
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,119
on what happens metabolically during a virus infection cycle using phages, model systems for

332
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,919
plant or animal viruses which of course were much more difficult to work with biochemically

333
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:34,480
at that time and in the early 1950s he and a postdoc had shown that DNA from

334
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,000
certain bacteria phases had a very unusual modification in that all of the cytosine

335
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,680
residues and DNA were modified by having a hydroxyl methyl group and then on the mid to late

336
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:52,400
1950s they'd shown the biochemical basis for this that there were new enzymes that were induced

337
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:59,680
after a virus infection that put on the hydroxyl methyl group and that phosphorylated the nucleotides

338
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:05,279
getters at the point where it could be activated and incorporated in the DNA. So the whole idea that

339
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,039
virus infection stimulated pneumatobolic pathways was really exciting to me and this ends on to put on

340
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:20,480
the on the the hydroxyl methyl group had a tetrahedral folate cofacture so it meant that I could

341
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,920
bring some biochemistry to Cohen's lab that would be that would be that would help him out and it

342
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:37,039
was it was nice pairing but again in those days so now we're talking 1961 you didn't just hop

343
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:44,240
on a plane to visit every lab that you were going to consider for a postdoc so I wrote to three people

344
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:54,159
and I was going to give a paper at the Federation meeting in 1960 in April 1961 this is the

345
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,440
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology which at that time included societies

346
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,879
for biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, nutrition and a couple of others and it was the big

347
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:12,159
meeting for biochemists to go to and so the three people that I was considering would be at the

348
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,559
meeting and I could meet with them there. This happened very shortly after Lawrence was born so

349
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:25,840
I really located that a gratitude and also my mother and Kate's mother and my grandmother

350
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,519
who all came in and helped out but I was able to go to the meeting and meet with them and it was

351
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:40,239
kind of amusing because on the first day of the meeting I met Seymour Cohen for the first time

352
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,599
and apparently my major professor who had sent a letter of recommendation sent a two-page letter

353
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:56,079
and I didn't learn this to later but the second page of the letter to Cohen had Dr. Boyer's

354
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:04,079
name at the top of the page and so Seymour knew that I was considering more than one laboratory

355
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,960
and he had recently had someone very good who had accepted a postdoc and then went somewhere else

356
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,360
and said so almost as soon as I shook hands with Seymour and introduced myself he said now see here

357
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,720
if I accept you and my laboratory are coming or aren't you and so it really set me off and I

358
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:28,320
wondered who is this guy anyway but then I met the other two people during that week and by the end

359
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:38,240
of the week I decided I wanted to work with Seymour so I had another appointment with him and almost

360
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,200
before I had a chance to say anything he said well I've decided I'd like to have you come and

361
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,759
join my lab and I said well that's funny I decided I wanted to join your lab too and then he

362
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:53,119
insisted on driving me to Philadelphia this is Atlantic City which is about 60 miles from Philadelphia

363
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,079
so I could see his lab and meet the other people which I did and that was very nice because then

364
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,759
I knew them all by the time I joined his group six or eight months later.

365
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,199
So from there you was on the Yale. How did that fund up and what was it like being a brand new

366
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:21,679
member at Yale? Things were much different back then. I used to get unsolicited offers of assistant

367
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,000
professorships they're not supposed to know offers I get a letter in the mail from the department

368
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,759
chairman that would say would would you like to apply for an assistant professorship in our

369
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:35,679
department and Seymour Cohen would come into the lab on occasion with letters do you like to

370
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,480
that you they they want me to recommend someone for this place of that place would you like to apply

371
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:50,399
most of the time I said well no and but Yale was interesting my my father had worked at the Yale

372
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:57,679
Medical School after the war back on in that interval between our lives and washing and

373
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:05,279
state and then I knew Yale was a pretty good place and so I I told Seymour he could go ahead and

374
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:11,119
to put my name in if he'd like but I told him I really hope to get back to the west coast

375
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:19,919
and he said well fine I'll write to a couple places where already like me to write and I said well

376
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:25,759
UC Davis has the new biochemistry department that's pretty good you could write to that and also

377
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,880
the University of Oregon has this new institute of molecular biology they has from two other people

378
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,840
there so he wrote to both places and they both wrote back and said they had positions and they were

379
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:43,600
interested and I should send my CV and so forth which I did and the meantime then I was invited

380
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:54,320
up to Yale to be interviewed and it was an interesting day I gave the seminar at noon and then I met

381
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,440
immediately after the seminar with the search committee and they gave me a lunch date which I

382
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,000
was trying to eat at the same time I was trying to answer questions it was it was pretty stressful

383
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,320
and one of the search committee members took me to the train at the end of the day and I went back

384
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:18,400
to Philadelphia and he said he said well we have to go through a series of steps before we can

385
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,920
make a decision on the anything but so maybe a while before you hear from us again and I thought

386
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,720
well that's fun I'm not to hurry anyway because I want to see what develops at Davis and Eugene

387
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,559
but within a week I had a letter from them saying that the the search committee had met and they

388
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,599
decided they were going to recommend that I get the appointment and so forth and eventually I did

389
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:55,279
get a formal offer of a letter and I sort of stalled them as long as I could and finally it was

390
00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:05,440
it was a good offer the salary was pretty poor by comparison with what my cohort was getting at

391
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:14,239
other places but it was the biology department I didn't consider myself so much in biologists but

392
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,039
they were trying to build up biochemistry and molecular biology within the department they wanted

393
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,719
me to set up a lab class in biochemical research techniques that their graduate students could take

394
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,439
said that was a bit of a challenge anyway I accepted the job on on on Monday and then I

395
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:39,359
wrote to the department chairs at Eugene and Davis and then on Thursday the phone rang in the lab

396
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,519
and I took the call it was the department chair at the view of O and he said oh Dr. Masey we just

397
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,960
got your letter and we're terribly disappointed we we got your last recommendation and the

398
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,559
fact we've had a meeting we decided you'd be ideal for the job we were about to invite you to come

399
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:02,640
out and give a seminar can we get you to change your mind and I you know I said I'm sorry I

400
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:08,480
made a commitment and that was that and then I went home thinking I guess I'd give it up my last

401
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:15,679
chance to go to a good university in the Pacific Northwest and who would have known what happened

402
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:27,599
years later so I went to Yale in starting in January 1964 and today's assistant professors of course

403
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,839
got almost the first year without significant teaching responsibilities to set up their lab

404
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,039
and the very first thing I had to start setting up to teach this lab class that was

405
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,119
beginning the end of the well the beginning of the spring semester which was the end of January or

406
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,920
the early February and I had ordered almost everything I needed but but a teaching assistant and I

407
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,519
had to set up the lab I had to write the the protocols for all the labs that the students would do

408
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:06,639
this is a class of 15 students so I was very busy with teaching on the other hand I also had my

409
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,159
NIH research grant that started on January 1st grants were incredibly easy to get back then

410
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,280
and so I was buying equipment and hiring a technician and getting my research labs set up

411
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:27,519
at the same time it was sort of a continuation of what I'd done as a postdoc one of the things

412
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,120
this is actually kind of an amusing story too the thesis my PhD thesis had been on the

413
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,519
enzyme dihydrofolate reductase which I told you was the target enzyme for metatruxate and there

414
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:47,599
was another lab that had shown the enzyme that makes the methyl group of thymine reduces a

415
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:55,039
methylene group to the methyl level that requires two electrons and the rate of DNA synthesis after

416
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:01,360
T4 phage infection goes up by about 10 fold which means there's a tremendous demand for DNA

417
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,119
precursors including thymine nucleotides and so since there's a two electron reduction

418
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:15,359
it turns out that the tetrahedral folate is oxidized to dihydrofolate and so when I became

419
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,559
aware of all this and I was talking to CMR Cohen one day on the lab and I said you know with this

420
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,559
big increase in demand for thymine nucleotides there are all these virus induced enzymes that you

421
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,279
and the other labs have been discovering we should be looking for dihydrofolate reductase there

422
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:37,519
there should be a virus specific form of dihydrofolate reductase as well I know how to

423
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:43,760
ask the enzyme I worked on it for my PhD you so as I go ahead and do that and he said why didn't you

424
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,000
focus on the problem that we agreed that you would work on when you came to the lab and I said okay

425
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,280
and then CMR was out of town for three days or so and I did the experiment and there was a

426
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,920
24-old increase in the specific activity of dihydrofolate reductase and in a T-fage in fact

427
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,519
itself is compared to uninfected cells and it turned out to be really easy to show that it was

428
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:15,920
a it was a different enzyme from the corresponding enzyme that existed in the uninfected bacteria so

429
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,240
one of the things I did we got a short paper out of it but one of the things that I did when I

430
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,480
went to Yale was just a it was golden opportunity to get a free paper we just purified the enzyme

431
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,480
and characterized it make mutants that were deficient in the production of the enzyme to see

432
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,519
what their phenotype was and so forth so there were a number of problems related to DNA precursor

433
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:46,639
metabolism early in infection by T even pectuary vagis that got me off to a pretty decent start

434
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,800
and I published six or eight papers in the first couple of years I was in Yale even though I had a

435
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,519
pretty heavy teaching load. So you were in Yale for four years definitely? Roughly, you got

436
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,200
actually three and a half by the calendar but they started my appointment as assistant professor

437
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:14,160
in July of 1963 and I was in absentia for the first half year and then I taught that lab class

438
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,840
and then in the fall they had me set up a lab for the what was an undergraduate cell biology course

439
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,519
which was basically biochemistry in the fall semester and cell biology and the spring semester

440
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,480
so a colleague and I shared the fall course where he did most of the lecturing I taught the lab.

441
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,640
Did your research in the change of the course you had kind of yellow or something specific with that

442
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,360
same topic? Oh, about the research? Yeah. Yeah I say pretty much with that I was branching out a

443
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:52,800
little bit more biologically and looking at questions such as the regulation, the time-specific

444
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:01,760
regulation of gene expression, virus infection involves a very well scheduled program of events

445
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,160
in gene activation and deactivation and so I was interested in what turns off the biosynthesis

446
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,960
these are really enzymes that are involved in DNA metabolism and then the activation of the

447
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,599
late proteins which are mostly structural proteins of the virus and proteins that help the virus

448
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:28,880
assemble so I was pretty much sticking with what I knew but branching out in slightly different

449
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:39,280
directions. What was your sense of the culture of Yale? Yeah that's an interesting question too.

450
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,720
It was all male of course as far as the undergraduate student body was concerned. There was a

451
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,440
fair amount of self-satisfaction. The undergraduate students were really bright, at least enough of them

452
00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:00,560
were really bright to make it worth the effort to teach them to make it fun. The graduate students

453
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,120
seemed like kind of a mixed lot to me. I wasn't hugely impressed to them at the time except for some

454
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,039
of the very good ones and what's turned out in retrospect is that I maybe was a little bit too

455
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:18,480
hard of them because a number of the graduate students that I thought were okay have turned out to have

456
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,000
very successful careers. I see their names in the literature all the time so I guess the students

457
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:33,359
were, they were as good as they thought they were but in terms of the culture my decision to leave

458
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:40,720
Yale after a fairly short period there. I knew when I went there I wouldn't have my whole career

459
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,559
there. I didn't really want to live in the East Coast. I knew that most people would take

460
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,280
non-tenger jobs at the Indian Ivy League move somewhere else and I thought it was a great place

461
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,079
to start from. I might not have left so early but we had a new department chair who came from

462
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:09,440
Johns Hopkins and he was a fairly argumentative sort. He was someone who always wanted to put

463
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:18,079
himself on the, he wanted to polarize discussions and so in my last year at Yale the other biochemist

464
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,799
in the department had gone on sabbatical and no arrangements had been made to take his place so

465
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,160
so I was giving all of his lectures and the cell biology courses as well as teaching the lab

466
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,280
in the fall and then teaching the graduate lab in the spring. In addition I'd become a pre-medical

467
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:44,000
advisor so I had several dozen advisees that I had to meet with and write letters of recommendation

468
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,440
for and I was being run ragged and trying to keep my research going as well. So there was a social

469
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:57,119
function and I went out to the department chair. There was a large department there about 45

470
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,000
people in the department so he'd be barely new and I engaged in a conversation and I asked

471
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,480
what are your thoughts about teaching versus research in an academic environment and he said

472
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,519
well of course you had to be a good teacher if you wanted to succeed at Yale but the main objective

473
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,800
was research. He said if you want to say at Yale your research must settle it, it must absolutely

474
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,120
send away and if you ever want to be a full professor at Yale in this department you have to be

475
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:33,760
someone that we can confidently number among the top 50 biologists in the country. So I went home

476
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,440
and I figured with the amount of teaching and committee work I was doing there wasn't any chance

477
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,240
of my rising to the top 50 and then I also looked around the department and I didn't see very many

478
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:53,359
full professors that I would rank in the top 50 myself there were one or two. So that has

479
00:49:53,359 --> 00:50:01,119
something to do with the culture I guess. So you mentioned in 1967 that Arizona? Right that came

480
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:09,519
about because the department chair at Arizona had been one of my professors at the University of

481
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:16,639
Washington he was on my committee. He was someone I liked a lot and he called me up one day

482
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,239
and told me that the University of Arizona had a new medical school starting and that he just

483
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,400
agreed to be chairman of the biochemistry department and what I liked to join him and I knew nothing

484
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:39,440
about Arizona at the time but I liked his name with Don Hanahan and he was in an area of biochemistry

485
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,639
that's quite different from mine he was an expert on biochemistry fats and lipids and the idea

486
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:53,599
of starting something new and there wasn't a matter of being interviewed of search committees

487
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:01,039
on that like that but basically just offered me a job over the phone and then I arranged to go out

488
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:08,880
and visit. This is in January 1967 and Kate went with me and we had to pay her expenses and it was

489
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,840
just a wonderful time. They put us up in a nice place and we got up in the morning and stepped

490
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,640
out the front door and picked a grapefruit for our breakfast off the tree that was going right next

491
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,280
to our front door and the dean and his wife took us out the dinner one night and in my years at

492
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:37,519
Yale I never met my dean the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and here was the dean taking

493
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,320
us out the dinner and telling me how much they hoped that I would decide to go there it was a

494
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:49,039
it was a promotion of rank to be an associate professor big increase in salary and the opportunity

495
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,759
to help shape something because the medical school is brand new everyone in Arizona was excited

496
00:51:53,759 --> 00:52:00,320
about the about the medical school that was starting and it just seemed like the right thing to do.

497
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,039
And did it about the expectation? Yes, you know I really enjoyed the time that we spent there we

498
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:16,320
were there for 10 and a half years and there was a lot of excitement in the first few years having

499
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,960
the feeling that we were helping to build the place up the medical school there was maybe a half

500
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,559
a mile from the main campus maybe a quarter mile it was a five minute bike ride or a 10 minute walk

501
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,159
and there was a little biochemistry group in the chemistry department that was pretty good and

502
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:40,320
the art department of medical school was small we had I think five or six faculty the whole time I was

503
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,759
there and so we merged and formed a joint graduate committee and biochemistry so that was one of the

504
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:53,759
things that I felt was a contribution on my part and the part of Don Hannah and that we wanted to

505
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:01,680
build bridges to the main campus whereas in other fields like microbiology there were barriers

506
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,120
that were built up and the bridges I think really were beneficial to the university and now they

507
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,280
have a combined university wide department that serves the main campus people and the medical

508
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,040
school people and mostly located on the main campus I think there are a couple people left in the

509
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,039
medical school building that focused on medical education.

510
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,279
So your obligation to stay in the fair enough from the old areas on it?

511
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,360
Yes they did of course teaching medical students was quite a different experience but I did

512
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:42,880
also were teach courses on the main campus and mostly the advanced undergraduate graduate

513
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:50,640
level course and some colleagues and I originated some graduate level courses I don't think I did

514
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,559
any graduate teaching a Yale except for the graduate lab class so I taught courses in biological

515
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,280
regulatory mechanisms and nucleic acids and so forth as well as teaching undergraduates and medical

516
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:12,400
students and but overall the I think the teaching load was a little bit I hate that term teaching

517
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,320
load the teaching obligation teaching opportunity was a little bit lighter than what it was at Yale

518
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,840
and so there's a little bit more time to get involved in research and again there was

519
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,639
building the department recruiting the other faculty members beginning to recruit graduate

520
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:37,840
students and getting funding for graduate student support and so forth you know it was a different

521
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:44,000
experience. So what kind of what was your line of research?

522
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,640
Well I continued with some of the some of the projects they were underway when I left

523
00:54:51,840 --> 00:55:01,280
Yale and picked up some new ones but they for the most part they had to do with the end

524
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:09,840
of biology and regulation of DNA precursors. One thing that happened was that people involved in

525
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:16,480
T4 bacteriophage genetics had generated a large number of mutants that were available and there

526
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:23,840
were mutants in maybe 15 genes that were involved in DNA synthesis and it wasn't clear what the

527
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:31,040
biochemical functions of all these genes coded for and so I got involved in that a little bit

528
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,960
to what extent to run might some of these genes have to do with DNA precursors and metabolism

529
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:45,360
to what extent might they have to do with DNA replication itself and so at some stage I became

530
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:51,840
interested in the in the relationship between the synthesis of the four DNA precursors,

531
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:58,800
A, G, C and T to make it simplest and the replication apparatus because DNA replication is a very

532
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:07,039
rapid process. It's in bacteria or in phasor-affected bacteria the DNA chain will grow at something

533
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,880
like 7 or 800 dupletides per second. So I started thinking how can the enzymes that are making

534
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,080
the precursors throughout the cell, how can a channel precursors to DNA polymerase, the replication

535
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,800
apparatus fast enough to sustain this rate. So I started working on the premise that there was a

536
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:35,200
super molecular organization within the infected cell with the precursor enzymes physically

537
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,840
located close to the the repelation, the machinery that synthesized the DNA so that you could get

538
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,320
channeling of precursors to DNA replication sites and that was a pretty big part of my research

539
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,200
for several of the years I was there. I wanted to quite a bit of time that I was here,

540
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,839
but we picked up some lines of research on comparable questions in mammalian cells,

541
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:06,799
working in tissue culture. I also had a couple of students who worked on theses quite independently

542
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:13,359
on things that were quite different from anything that I did. One of them was sure that aging

543
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:19,759
was a question of gene expression and that you should be able to learn something about aging if

544
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,040
you do something about the kinetics of nucleic acid metabolism. He did a thesis that was partly

545
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:35,200
computational, partly biochemical on RNA metabolism that he published, one paper published independently

546
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:44,560
and one paper he put my name on as a curious gesture. After I came here, he joined my lab again.

547
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:53,599
He had a grant and he needed a site that he could work for, he could work fairly independently.

548
00:57:53,599 --> 00:58:00,719
I remember that I'd let him have his own head. He was here for a couple of years and then

549
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:10,239
he got the idea of antisense as a potential drug and founded a company called Antivarals in his

550
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:16,719
recreation room here in Carvalos and then that turned into ultimately into AVI Biofarma,

551
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:22,079
which is a biotechnology company in Carvalos and eventually he left them and formed another

552
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:32,479
company, Gene Tools, which is in full on it and it's hugely successful. So even though all I

553
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:42,000
provided was a supporting environment at Arizona, it's turned out having a very nice spin-off here.

554
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:47,280
We're at about an hour, are you going to know, okay? Yeah, come on.

555
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,719
So this is your first experience of the self-less and you mentioned that experience of taking a great

556
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:04,319
experience. Yeah. We really enjoyed living there and both Kate and I are pretty enthusiastic

557
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:11,279
outdoors people and we found out that there's a lot more variety in the hours on of them. We

558
00:59:11,279 --> 00:59:17,679
ever believed there was Tucson is bring by four mountain ranges and we did a lot of backpacking

559
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:22,559
there and we went camping in Mexico. It turned out there were some very nice

560
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:32,480
beach areas on the Gulf of California that we went and did weekend camping at and so we really

561
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,840
did everything we could to enjoy and profit from the southwest and we miss a lot of that. We

562
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,840
missed being able to get into the out of doors 12 months of the year very easily. But Tucson was

563
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:52,159
growing with very little planning and Tucson is one of the largest cities in the world.

564
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:59,359
It gets all of its water from underground and when the chance came to come to come here of course

565
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,359
it was professionally a very nice opportunity. We were happy to Tucson and I wondered do we

566
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,839
really want to move? But one of the features was how much longer is it going to mean up water

567
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,399
sustaining the population? How much longer are we going to have these beautiful desert environments

568
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:22,880
that really state the developments that are crowding on to? That all convinced us that we really enjoyed

569
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,960
the 10 years there but maybe it was time to go and every time we go back to Tucson we're horrified

570
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:37,039
at the additional growth that's occurred. You put the sabbatical of the US UCSD in 1973?

571
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,079
Right. Kate still criticizes me on occasion for not having taken a European sabbatical

572
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:50,079
end because our children were something like 12 and 14 at the time and they probably really

573
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:56,239
went a profit from a year in Europe. But I still had a fairly small research group and wanted to

574
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:04,639
stay in reasonable close touch with them and of course UCSD was a growing academic environment

575
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,239
with some superb people and we lived near the beach so it was a very nice living for the year.

576
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:16,479
I split the year between two different laboratories so I had two different kinds of experiences

577
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,119
and it was very nice. It was a good sabbatical.

578
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,479
The first six months I worked with a guy named Gordon Sado who was an expert on

579
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:39,839
culturing cells and maintaining their differentiated characteristics in culture and I wanted

580
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,400
to learn teacher culture because I wanted to give a little branch out with our interests into

581
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:51,200
mammalian systems so I could take what we were learning and microbial model systems and apply

582
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:56,800
them to mammalian or maybe human systems so I wanted to learn teacher culture. So I did a project

583
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:06,320
that had to do with growth factors in cell culture and then in the second six months I went to

584
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:12,080
the script's institutional oceanography where I had a very good friend who was an expert on the

585
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:20,000
biochemistry of early events in fertilization using the sea urchin and so fertilization is a

586
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,240
little comparable to the phage effect that is among the metabolic changes that occurs as a huge

587
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,920
turn on of a DNA synthesis and the cleavage cycles, the cell cleavage cycles are very fast so

588
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:45,280
so DNA genomes are reproduced in the order of half an hour so and so the question in my mind was

589
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,800
where do the precursors come from are they stored or is there a turn out of synthesis so that was

590
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:01,519
what I worked on in Dave's lab and it turned out that the sea urchin egg has huge supplies of

591
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:07,360
deoxyonucleuside triphosphates and then backup pools of the monophosphates and the triphosphates

592
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:16,320
so the egg is really geared to activate DNA synthesis very soon after fertilization and I thought

593
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,440
about going back and working about system a little bit of my own after I came here but to never

594
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,000
got around to it there were plenty of other things to do. What's the trend to straighten down there?

595
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:35,840
No, I don't think so. At the... Yeah, he was been at the Sock Institute. I've forgotten when I moved

596
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:44,079
there. I should know that because I reviewed the biography of Francis Quick just a few months ago

597
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:52,239
for an eternal and made fascinating reading. It was all these books. Yeah, in my review I wrote that

598
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:57,439
that this... I've been asked to review quite a few scientific books over the years. This is the

599
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:02,719
first one I actually read word for word cover for cover and cover. It's a redlock in novel but

600
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:07,919
I'm pretty sure that was before Kirk had moved to Sock. Over with here.

601
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:18,000
Was that right? I wish I'd known about that because I knew the name already. I knew he was a famous

602
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,519
historian of science, the recent historian of science.

603
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:34,239
Seymour Cohen was very interested in the early history of molecular biology.

604
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,159
He was pretty unpopular with the crowd in that field because he was so aggressively

605
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,039
pro-biochemical and didn't necessarily believe in genetics. Seymour Cohen was the first grad

606
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:57,920
with student of Irwin Shargaf. Shargaf who had promulgated the base composition

607
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:07,039
regularities that helped Watson and Quick develop their model. Shargaf had been very bitter about

608
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:13,920
being left out of credit for that. I think Seymour shared Shargaf's bitterness to some extent.

609
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,840
When the Nobel Prize was announced, I was in Seymour's lab and this is 1962.

610
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:30,239
It went to Watson and Quick and Maurice Wilkins. Seymour came into the lab and said,

611
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:36,079
well, if they were going to include Wilkins and the Nobel Prize, they should have included

612
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,360
Shargaf because his contribution was just substantial. I think he could make a pretty good case for

613
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:50,160
that. Of course, the Nobel Prize is limited to three awardees. I'm sure that didn't do very much

614
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,599
Irwin Shargaf's mood either.

615
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,519
He was a headman for the evidence for the full guy.

616
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:02,559
Yeah. In fact, Shargaf was the one who got me started thinking about Seymour Cohen

617
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:09,519
because my second year in graduate school, Shargaf came to Seattle and gave a series of lectures.

618
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,000
During the lectures, he talked about virus and do sins on. He talked about work by

619
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,039
student Seymour Cohen. I immediately went to the literature and started reading Seymour Cohen's

620
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:34,640
papers. I'd never heard them before. That was what got me fired up. The fact that Seymour was

621
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,760
Irwin Shargaf's student, but at some point, I met the

622
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:50,160
guy that was the chairman of biochemistry at Columbia when Shargaf had moved from Europe. I

623
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:58,800
think he was a refugee and the Columbia took him in. The chairman, his name was Hans Clarke.

624
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,640
He was quite a distinguished biochemist. Tell me what you're doing to Dr. Matthew. I said,

625
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,519
well, I'm a postdoc in the University of Pennsylvania. Who are you working with? I'm working with

626
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:16,719
Seymour Cohen. Oh, yes. Seymour. He's one of my boys, you know. It was very paternal or paternalistic.

627
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,559
So Seymour was Irwin Shargaf's student, but it turned out that when Seymour was working on his

628
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:31,119
postdoc or on his PhD, neither of them was working on their collect assets at the time. Seymour

629
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,799
is PhD thesis on long surf acting, which is a phospholipid. It wasn't until years later that both

630
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,440
Shargaf and Cohen independently started working on the click-hasted biochemistry.

631
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:51,199
There's something kind of fascinating about the personalities involved in the recent history of

632
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:57,039
science. Yeah. Yeah. Cohen something that he was definitely a pretty big figure in life.

633
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:05,199
He was. Yeah. He taught the famous course in comparative biochemistry. I don't

634
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:10,880
remember why I never sat in on the course. I should have, but he was very broadly based. He was

635
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:19,680
very rigorous in his thinking. And he had a pretty priculous personality. So he was definitely

636
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:25,359
a challenge to work for. But he was so broad and he had so many ideas that I think influenced

637
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:32,479
me to read pretty widely in science and trying to maintain and brought awareness. That's

638
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,839
helping a lot and writing a textbook. And also since I became a member of the editorial board of

639
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:44,079
the Journal of Biological Chemistry, I get sent papers to review that are way way outside of my

640
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:50,960
area because the editors know that I can sit down and read something. I got a paper to review a

641
01:08:51,039 --> 01:09:00,560
couple years ago on the biochemistry body order if you believe that. Well, we converted this

642
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,800
a little bit in 1972. I see it in sounds like they made a pretty good opportunity to have the

643
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:14,000
primary reason in the horizon. Right. There was an interesting situation too. I didn't have any

644
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,319
real reasons to leave Arizona. As I said, you can always find things to feel uneasy about. But

645
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:33,520
I felt pretty well accepted on the campus. But I said my family was all still in the Pacific

646
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:41,439
Northwest. And so I kept my eye out for opportunities. And OSU advertised for a chair of the Department

647
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:48,319
of Biochemistry and Bio Physics and Science. So I wrote, sent my CV and eventually was asked for

648
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:55,840
my references. Voice, sent me names, references and eventually was asked to interview. And I had

649
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:02,079
enough information about the departments to know that it was a pretty good department. And they

650
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:08,559
sent me the data on the research funding of the faculty. And there were 14 faculty at the time.

651
01:10:09,759 --> 01:10:16,159
Everyone except one had some kind of outside research funding. Publication records look pretty good.

652
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:23,119
So on the days when I was interviewed, it was a two day or two and a half day process.

653
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,199
I had a series of half hour talks with the faculty. And each one, I would say, you know, you've

654
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:36,479
got a good department. Why are you looking outside for your chair? You could fill the chairmanship

655
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:42,720
inside. And I got told pretty much the same thing by everyone. And of course, when you get

656
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,320
consistency, that's a pretty good sign. And what they said was, this is our only chance to bring

657
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,119
in a senior level faculty person who can bring in a funded research program and give a jump start

658
01:10:55,119 --> 01:11:02,079
to our department's reputation. Because if we appointed an inside person to share them,

659
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:08,079
we'd have to fill the vacancy at the system professor level. So that made sense. And they said that

660
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,039
the department was in pretty good shape, scientifically, and personally everyone got along,

661
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:19,840
which really seemed to be the case. And so what they wanted was someone who was a pretty active

662
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,039
scientist and teacher who was willing to do some administration and leadership. And that was

663
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:32,079
sort of how I saw myself. I knew by that time I could probably handle the administrative details

664
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:37,840
of being a department chair, but it wasn't the be all and end all of my existence. And so it was

665
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:44,319
a pretty good fit. And then after a few weeks after the interview, the dean called up to offer me

666
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:53,039
the job. It was my 40th birthday. And so it seemed like a, it seemed like a, an omen of some kind.

667
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:59,600
And that was kind of amusing too, because I put in a call, oh, this happened later on. So I got

668
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,199
the offer. And then Kate and I were invited back to visit again in this time. It was a recruitment

669
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:15,279
visit. And it was very pleasant again. And then went back home and after a while thought things

670
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:21,439
over and decided I would accept the job. So I put in a call to the dean and he was out of the office.

671
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:26,319
And he would call back. And I sat there thinking I was about to make a decision that would affect

672
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,960
the rest of my life. And the phone rang and I thought it was Dean Proust calling me back.

673
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,119
No, it was the guy from the biochemistry department of the University of California Davis

674
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,960
asking if I'd like to be considered for the chairmanship with the department there.

675
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,600
And I said you got a great department, but I think it's a little too late.

676
01:12:53,119 --> 01:13:00,399
The main priority for me to keep my research program visible on

677
01:13:00,559 --> 01:13:06,879
productive. It's quite a job to move a research program. I knew that the department would be in

678
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,599
pretty good shape. There were a few things that needed to be done.

679
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:16,639
You know, I knew I could handle whatever teaching I need to do here.

680
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:22,159
But not all the people that were working with me in Tucson chose to come. So I had to

681
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:29,199
had to punch more people. And my major research grant had, I don't remember a year and a half

682
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,000
or so to run. And I just wanted to make sure that I'd got enough papers out during that time.

683
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,519
So I'd be competitive. It was grants were already this now in the late 1970s.

684
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:44,880
The grant situation was beginning to tighten up. So that was my first priority. It worked out pretty well.

685
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:50,000
Did the administrative pressure exchange over time?

686
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,800
Yes. But actually getting back to priorities for just a minute,

687
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,680
there were some things in the department early on that I felt should get taken care of.

688
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,880
One was the fact that a graduate student's

689
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,560
there was hardly any money in the department to support teaching assistance. So there wasn't much

690
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,600
state money that would support students who weren't committed to allow. So almost all the students

691
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,600
came on research assistantships which meant they were committed to the lab whose research grant

692
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,240
was paying their assistantship. And I thought that a first year grad with program should have

693
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,120
opportunity for students to come on committed. I thought it was a great strength that students

694
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:41,520
could come here and start right to work with a person that they wanted to work with but that

695
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:49,440
many students come without a specific set of interest and they should have an opportunity to go

696
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:55,199
through rotations. So pretty high priority for me early on was to get an NIH training grant that

697
01:14:55,199 --> 01:15:01,439
would provide funds for tuition and stipends for half a dozen students or so so that we could bring

698
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:08,239
out a few and give them a year to look around and then go on to research assistantships. And my first

699
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:18,479
attempt was unsuccessful. That was kind of interesting too because we got kind of a mediocre

700
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:27,839
score on the grant application and really kind of a snotty critique in which the whoever reviewed

701
01:15:27,839 --> 01:15:34,799
the grant said the training record of the faculty doesn't seem to be particularly strong.

702
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:41,759
Most of the graduate seemed to have taken jobs in industry and I wrote to the NIH and I said

703
01:15:41,759 --> 01:15:47,759
what is this? It seems to me that Congress which funds the NIH might have second thoughts about

704
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,960
the training and program of industrial positions are seeing a second rate. So I'm going to revise

705
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,520
the application and I'd like to have a site visit so you can see what we have out here. And so the

706
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,920
second time we had a site visit and we got the grant and had it for two or three cycles. So that

707
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:18,880
was a sort of an institutional priority for me. And then in 1981, so this was an opportunity

708
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,960
to sort of dump in my lap but it was an institutional priority for me. The dean called me in and

709
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,640
said that the MJ Murdoch Charitable Trust, you know about the Murdoch Trust, this is a large foundation

710
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,320
that was created from the estate of Jack Murdoch who was one of the founders of Tectronics.

711
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:49,680
Murdoch died prematurely in an airplane accident and he left most of the state entrusted as a

712
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:57,440
foundation to support educational, charitable and community organizations of the Civil War.

713
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:04,400
And they used to give project grants to faculty here but apparently the trust had told President

714
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:14,079
Wicker that they now wanted to focus their grants more on large multi-person projects that

715
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:20,159
represented institutional priorities. And so the dean and the president and others then decided

716
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:25,599
that he was time to make a push in molecular biology and so they called me in as the person to

717
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:34,079
sort of the point person to write something up. And it was clear, that was right, it was very much

718
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:41,199
a time to make a push even though that doesn't pretty good people scattered around the university here

719
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:52,319
in that area. And it was clear to me that there's multi-departmental cooperation is very strong

720
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:57,519
on this campus and so whatever we did should be in a multi-departmental, multi-discipline or

721
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:04,000
framework. So I proposed that the university create something that would be called the Center

722
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:14,000
of Virginia Research and that the grant then fund three positions and pay their salaries and

723
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,840
start-up costs for two years with the commitment by the university that their salaries would be

724
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,360
continued at the end of that two years and that the search would be conducted in a multi-departmental

725
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,679
framework. There was old money also for project grants for the faculty that was here.

726
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:38,079
And so then when the grant was funded we had a we had a multi-departmental search that

727
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,639
brought three excellent people in. One who came to our department is now the chairman of our

728
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:50,000
department, Gary Merrill. One who went to botany, Carol Rubin, and one who went to microbiology and

729
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:57,279
that's Dennis Ruby who's now the chief scientific officer at Seagal Farm of Sugals. So very good people.

730
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:06,399
In the meantime the people in the ag school wanted to form a biotechnology institute or biotechnology

731
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:14,319
center and President Wicker told them that there wasn't a that the campus wasn't big enough to

732
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:19,679
have two competing centers and areas related to biotechnology and they'd better work with us.

733
01:19:21,519 --> 01:19:27,359
So we made the center. I mean I had no idea it would grow to something that encompassed

734
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:35,599
the whole campus the way it did but it turned out to be very successful. And in the first several

735
01:19:35,599 --> 01:19:42,880
years I think 1985 the center had caught on so well that the legislature appropriated a pretty

736
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:49,520
fierce chunk of change as continuing a continuing budget for the quite that time with the CGRB.

737
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,239
So that was something else that worked out pretty well and then I served the director of the

738
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,800
center for a year and a half or so after the first director left the fairly abruptly.

739
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,000
What did the center stand for?

740
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:18,239
Well it continued to get bigger and stronger and after I resigned as director

741
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:24,720
because I couldn't handle two administrative jobs and still keep research lab going and keep my

742
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,920
teaching going and so there was sort of an interim appointment made while there was an outside

743
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,560
search and Russ mines came from the University of Nebraska and he built it up a bit and then he

744
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:46,240
retired and then a really big push came when Jim Carrington was brought in and of course he had a

745
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:54,640
superb research program and so I think his program attracted a lot of other people

746
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:00,800
and departments all over the campus were beginning to use molecular biology techniques.

747
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:11,280
So the center and then Jim changed the focus of the center with a big emphasis on

748
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:17,840
genomics and computational biology. In fact the name of the center was changed. I didn't realize

749
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,160
this for a couple years. It's still the CGRB but now instead of being the center for gene

750
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:32,639
research and biotechnology it's the center for genomics research and bio computing and so five or

751
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:42,079
six years ago there was a university wide hiring initiative in genomics and bio computing and there

752
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:50,639
was another MOLI departmental search that I think brought five faculty members and they're

753
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:56,079
outstanding people. One of them is Michael Freitag who came to the art department and his

754
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:01,520
office is right next door to mine and one is Todd Mockler and botanates and extremely well.

755
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:11,200
I think he left Carrington left this year to become a president and a director of the Danforth

756
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:17,280
foundation in St. Louis. I just learned a dare to the Mockler went with him but it's really

757
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:23,679
outstanding people came and the focus to the center changed and it's well rooted in the

758
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:33,039
university. The central service lab which the center maintains carries out multine investigator

759
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:43,279
procedures, nucleic acid sequencing and oligopeptide synthesis that it's been doing for years but it

760
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:51,199
also has a very large computational and second generation DNA sequencing capability grafted on so

761
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:57,119
it's got bigger and stronger over the years. So getting back to the administrative

762
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:06,800
responsibilities, how did they shift over the years? They shifted in that it got harder and harder

763
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:14,640
to get money and there was a little bit more administration that had to get done. So the first year or

764
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:22,480
two I was here, one of my colleagues got money and one of his grants, $100,000 to buy an electron

765
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,800
microscope. This is one art department that's telling him what are your hall and he came to me and

766
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,840
said we need a room to put the electron microscope in and I said well I guess we're going to have to

767
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:41,279
see the Dean so we don't see Dean Krauss and it was maybe a 15 minute conversation and he found

768
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:48,000
$50,000 to renovate some space on the first floor to Wunderland so we got the pretty substantial

769
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:56,079
amount of money on the basis of a one short conversation. Getting money became harder and harder

770
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:05,359
and at one point so our department has always been very heavily involved with the Environmental

771
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:13,039
Health Science Center. This is a center that's funded with a core grant from the National Institute

772
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:21,680
of Environmental Health Sciences and it was originally headquartered basically on what used to be

773
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,640
the Department of Agricultural Chemistry and that again is a center that's become bigger and

774
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:32,720
stronger over the years and at some point when the previous director retired Don Reed who was

775
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:39,200
an art department became the director so we were heavily involved with that center and one of the

776
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:46,000
hardest things for me in my last several years of being department share was accumulating competitive

777
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,280
startup packages when we wanted to recruit a faculty member. That's one thing to get us

778
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:58,639
a salary line but around the country the amount of money you had to put together to track someone

779
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:03,599
getting larger and larger because a new assistant professor couldn't count on getting his or her

780
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:13,679
first grant funded and needed some money from day one and I remember one of the people who came in

781
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:20,159
as Vice President for Research which is of course one of the major sources that we would go to.

782
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:28,319
I think I've suppressed his name because I dislike him so much. Somehow or another he never caught

783
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:35,519
onto the idea that the discretionary funds he had as a disposal one of the highest priorities

784
01:25:35,519 --> 01:25:41,119
of them should be contributions toward setup funds and Don Reed who was still the director of the

785
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:51,599
the the EHSC and I talked or so blue in the face before we got a token contribution from and

786
01:25:52,559 --> 01:26:02,079
and we were just really irritated and I remember another interesting episode we had with the

787
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:07,279
Environmental Health Science Center when Don Reed became director of the center this was in the

788
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:13,279
early 1980s he also was pretty expansionist he wanted to build and solidify the EHSC

789
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:19,920
and this sort of parenthetical but in my opinion one of the strengths of Oregon State I said

790
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:25,519
something about the Inter-Departmental Cooperation you have strong individual departments but these

791
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:32,639
you have these centers that that span departmental boundaries we have the CGRB the EHSC and of

792
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:38,240
course the line is Pauling Institute and I think all of these centers have done nothing but good

793
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:44,160
things for the university by bringing in more research so one thing that Don Reed wanted to do

794
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,840
was to use the funds he had in the center to establish two or three new

795
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:57,200
faculty positions that would be partly funded by the EHSC and partly funded by university funds

796
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:02,239
so one of the positions would be in our department if you wanted to get someone who was

797
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,960
using cell culture to study basically areas related to environmental toxicology

798
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:15,599
and the dean at the time said well our department was overstaffed already that we had

799
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:24,319
too many faculty positions for the number of credit hours that we taught you know the kind of

800
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:29,679
thinking that administrators go through and of course both Don and I saw this as a great

801
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,559
opportunity to strengthen the department research wise and bring in some more money to the department

802
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:43,199
and Don was pretty aggressive so he set up a so he set up a employment a meeting with President

803
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:50,159
Luther and six or eight of a sat around a table including Don and myself and George Keller who

804
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:54,720
was the vice president for research at the time and Dean Sir Gajaro Dean of the College of

805
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:04,319
Science and the president maybe one or two others and Dean Sir Gajaro went through his routine that

806
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:09,760
the department was overstaffed already and he couldn't justify putting even a part of a salary into

807
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:17,760
our budget under the circumstances and then Don Reed gave his pitch I don't think I said much

808
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,640
of anything I was just there for support Don got all the negative brownie points from the dean

809
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,480
and at the end of Don's talk part of the record said well it sounded like a pretty good proposal

810
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:34,880
let's go ahead with it and I thought the dean was going to cry and so at that from that point on

811
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,520
Don Reed's name was poison in the College of Science but it worked out very well he brought in

812
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,640
David Barnes who's no longer here but that position was established and we have got a research

813
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,960
facility that's helped the whole campus community and then he brought in Dale Mausbaugh in what

814
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:05,120
Hannah was at at Cam that Mausbaugh had a superb research program until he died very young in 2004

815
01:29:05,599 --> 01:29:19,439
but the idea that you could use Center funds to strengthen research programs within departments

816
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:26,640
in the Strankland Inter-Departmental Cooperation has been a keynote for the CDRB the EHSC

817
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:33,199
and the Linus Paulingance in fact the really history of the Linus Paulingance is pretty interesting too

818
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:42,640
Don Reed was acting director of the Institute but we had a search for director

819
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,800
and I was chair of the search committee that brought both right here

820
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,599
and that worked out extremely successfully both it's so good and the people he'd brought

821
01:29:55,599 --> 01:30:04,159
in are just outstanding but I think the only time I ever had a one-on-one conversation with

822
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:12,399
President Brisser was shortly with while this was all underway I think I don't remember whether

823
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:20,319
balls fry to arrive yet or when we're still having research but of course it was concerned

824
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:25,840
all over the campus about LPI how it would drain research resources away from the administration

825
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:33,119
and and of course the the Linus Paulingance Institute in California was was pretty mixed

826
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:39,920
with scientific quality and that was a bit of a concern but John Byrne really pushed the

827
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:47,760
whole thing it was his legacy to the university and we were and so Brisser and I were walking

828
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:57,199
together from some function and it was just the two of us and he said what do you think about

829
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,640
this move of the Linus Paulingance Institute anyway is obviously was pretty negative about the

830
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:08,000
whole thing and I said it doesn't make it I said it doesn't make any difference what you or I

831
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,800
think about it it's happening anyway and at the time I think I was one of the cautious ones

832
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:22,320
without a tube but I'd become nothing but a supporter because we were so fortunate in getting

833
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:28,560
balls to come here is our first choice I thought the recruitment would be very difficult because

834
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,280
the LPI occupied space that our department occupied before we moved to Agony Life Sciences

835
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:45,680
and it was pretty it was the space was pretty trashed but but both saw that it could work

836
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,840
they did a little bit of renovation and of course they said that a new building would be something

837
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:58,079
it would be fairly high on the priority scale but it took a long time but it worked so you asked

838
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,960
about the administrative load the other thing that happened in those last several years was the

839
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:09,840
planning of the Agony Life Sciences building that took a lot of time and then in the initial planning

840
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:17,920
I became aware that there were documents in the university that had five levels of space

841
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:25,600
assignment depending on what kind of department or college you were in and of course

842
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:36,000
agricultural forestry were on the highest level number square feet per FTE of lab space square

843
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:45,520
feet per FTE for office space and science was a level below ag and so we started having our first

844
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:53,520
planning meetings and it was mostly ag people of course because of the Agony Life Sciences

845
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,480
and biochemistry bio physics was put into the department sort of accidentally and the way I

846
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:05,440
understood it was the administration was having trouble assembling funding for the building

847
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:13,360
and it's all seriously but the way I heard it was that George Keller said well we don't have enough

848
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:19,199
pizzazz in the building we have range science we have ag administration we have horticulture they're all

849
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:25,439
perfectly justifiable but we need to put some of our environmental science we need to put some

850
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:30,239
more biotechnology in there and apparently Dean Horn was at the planning meeting he said well

851
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:35,759
you know biochemistry and bio physics is heavily involved in both the biotechnology and environmental

852
01:33:35,759 --> 01:33:43,199
health science so we were moved in very quickly but then it turned out that they wanted to assign

853
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:51,840
space on the science level assignment and I figured if we're moving to the new building we need to

854
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,439
have the same kind of space allocation that the other departments in the building had

855
01:33:57,519 --> 01:34:05,679
is about that time about that time a friend of mine who was chairman of the search committee

856
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,599
for Dean of science at Penn State invited me to come to look at the job

857
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:18,720
and after I looked at it it was I didn't want the job but it was clear that they wanted me

858
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:26,320
so I went to talk to Graham Spaniard of course he would come here from Penn State and now

859
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:31,920
as back there is one of the most successful university presidents in the country and Graham was

860
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,840
was very excited to hear that they wanted me to go to Penn State he didn't talk to me at all

861
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,800
about what can we do to keep you he wanted to know a lot about what was happening at Penn State

862
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:49,840
and so forth but he did eventually you know what would it take to keep you and I had two things in

863
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:58,239
mind that would benefit the department and one of them was space allocation the new building I said

864
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:03,039
they're basically trying us to talk and sound on space we have adequate space in one of

865
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:10,079
the spaces kind of second rate quality was but if we're going to be asked to help plan a new

866
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:18,319
building and move into space we need to we need to be assured that if we don't have to accept any

867
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:24,079
less square footage what we have now so he put that on a letter that helped me a lot is

868
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:27,119
we'll have to be the planning process but that took a lot of time to

869
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:31,680
were there any major shifts in your research during the years?

870
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:43,680
yes not major I've always always been involved in in nuclear time the oxygen nuclear time in

871
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:52,159
DNA precursor in the zymology and biochemistry yeah I can tell you look yeah the answer is yes I'll

872
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:56,399
get to that in a minute but I'll tell you another story about the new building that you might

873
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:04,720
find entertaining this has to do with the administrative load and you have to watch these guys all the time

874
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:10,079
actually two stores one time we were in a meeting in the administration building and

875
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:16,239
and they we were being told that there wasn't enough money to build a building with size that

876
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:22,559
was being discussed in the beginning and we were going all around the table what can we do about

877
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:27,279
this cutback and that cutback and it was it was getting pretty late in the country in the evening

878
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:33,840
you know six o'clock six three or so and the guy named Ed Cote was the vice president for the

879
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,760
administration of the time and he was kind of a laughing stock in the faculty and he was getting

880
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:47,840
more and more impatient he basically said finally hey it's getting late here let's just

881
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:56,239
lop off a floor and we can leave so that's solidified our review about Ed Cote and somehow it ended

882
01:36:56,239 --> 01:37:01,600
up that the building was built I think the university got a bargain it's a very good building he

883
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:10,240
was done with the funds available but at one point the architect told me that we've we've built

884
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:17,120
a prototype laboratory so you and your colleagues can go over look at it look at the cabinets look

885
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:21,520
at the shell look at the bench top look at the utility and see what it looked like I said we're

886
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,079
as well it's in in Morland Hall there's a member of the psychology faculty

887
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:35,840
Bill Smotheren who does physiological work and and he needed a he needed an upgrade to his lab so

888
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:41,359
we've built that as a prototype lab and you can go and see what it looks like and so we went over

889
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:44,800
and it did its nice lab and so we could see what kind of counter top they were going to have

890
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:51,279
and the new building and so forth and then it occurred to me to ask someone hey where the money

891
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,960
come from to do this it turns out that Bill Smotheren had been offered a job in another institution

892
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:06,239
and and he needed in order to stay one of the things that he needed was an upgrade to his lab so

893
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:12,559
we went to his dean the dean went to the then Provost and somehow things that come about so that

894
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:18,559
money was siphoned out of our building project to build this guy's lab and so we raised hell about

895
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,200
and so they had to find the money from somewhere else and put it back into the building project

896
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:31,200
so you had to be on your toes all the time about these guys so getting back to research

897
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:40,800
I had a graduate student in the early who finished in about 1982 who did his thesis on

898
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:49,440
the DNA precursor supply for the mitochondrial adrenal I'd seen a paper in the literature that

899
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:58,400
suggested that the mitochondrial genome is fed by a distinct precursor pool that might be generated

900
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:06,079
within the mitochondrial and so Rick Besswick did his thesis on the series of experiments and

901
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:14,000
indicated yes indeed the pools were physically distinct and regulatory sense as well and

902
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:21,039
then that sort of sat there until the late 1990s and another grader was student joined our group

903
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:26,399
she was a song Chinese student who wanted to follow up on that work he was a

904
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:33,680
head medical degree from China and the number of diseases had been described that have

905
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:40,560
that have genetic effects within the mitochondria and some of them are mutations within the

906
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:46,800
mitochondrial genome some of them are mutations of the nuclear genome that encode proteins that

907
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:52,000
are transported into mitochondria and function there and so there's some very interesting

908
01:39:52,720 --> 01:40:02,320
diseases and of course now there's also the the idea that accumulation of mutations in the

909
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:09,920
mitochondrial genome is partly responsible both for cancer and aging and since we knew that

910
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:17,920
aspects of DNA precursor metabolism are mutagenic determinants that is metabolic

911
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:28,000
derangement but if you will deoxyneucleotide metabolism can affect the mutation rate we

912
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,800
wanted to learn more about the mitochondrial pools of DNA precursors where they came from how they

913
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:39,840
were regulated and how this might affect mutation rate it turns out the mutation rate for the mitochondrial

914
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:47,039
genome is much higher than it is for the nuclear genome and why should this be so she way did his

915
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:53,199
thesis on this and he was one of my last graduate students to finish but by the time he started

916
01:40:53,199 --> 01:41:01,679
publishing papers from his thesis we began to get some notice for this so I got funding

917
01:41:02,559 --> 01:41:08,479
actually after I retired and was hoping I'd be able to keep research funding going because this

918
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:17,119
was turning out to be a pretty productive line of research so so in fact that has been the

919
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:24,559
total of our research since about 2003 and and I had pretty decent funding for that and during that

920
01:41:24,559 --> 01:41:34,239
time the three graduate students that I had at the time I retired in 2002 they took two or three four

921
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:40,079
years to finish and they were done but after that I kept my lab going with a technician and a

922
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:48,640
postdoc and one or two undergrad was supposed to the time now I decided to to let my funding

923
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,800
expire and what there's a new faculty member in our department is going to take over our lab

924
01:41:53,680 --> 01:42:01,600
so my last grant expires the end of the year but for the last year it's taken the knowledge and

925
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:07,840
the background I have and the oxygenucleotide metabolism just applied it to mammalian cells and

926
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:15,520
mitochondrial metabolism. The last sort of big topic I like to talk about is your textbook by chemistry.

927
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:22,159
Right so what was the process in which you and Ben hold this entity we're going to do this?

928
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:31,359
In 1983 and 1984 there were two major texts that came out

929
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:42,559
and we have two sort of advanced level undergraduate courses BB-450 451 which most students take as a

930
01:42:42,559 --> 01:42:49,680
two-quarter sequence and then BB-49491 and 492 and these can both be taken as undergrad or graduate

931
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:55,680
and these two books came out and one of them we assigned to the 450 course and one we adopted

932
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:02,159
for the 492 course and they're both terrible and at some point in the spring

933
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:09,600
it was eating my lunch and they in my office and a publisher's representative came in and I

934
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:17,360
sort of set my sandwich aside and so I told them how disappointed we were with all the textbooks

935
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:22,799
they were on the market and he said well you know so much about what's wrong with all these books

936
01:43:22,799 --> 01:43:28,399
you ought to be writing your own book and I said are you crazy I don't have the time or the expertise

937
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:35,279
about the whole book said well get a co-author. Well I was about to go on sabbatical leave

938
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:40,319
to Sweden and I thought well you know maybe I could write in the evening working a lab during the

939
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:47,199
day so it's not a completely crazy idea and I was talking to my colleague Bob Becker about this

940
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:53,199
and he said well why don't you talk to Ken Van Holt he's talked about writing textbooks from

941
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:59,839
time to time and Ken and I had taught graduate level courses together I knew he was extremely

942
01:43:59,839 --> 01:44:08,799
articulate and brilliant scientist and he had a good sense of humor and also was much more of a

943
01:44:08,799 --> 01:44:15,279
physical biochemist than I am his PhD that's my physical chemistry so I went and talked to Ken

944
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:20,159
and he said well I'd have to be crazy to even think about something like this but yes I am

945
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:25,920
interested so we went down and visited the publisher and talked to our editor, the woman who would

946
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:35,039
be our editor and she said that each of us should write a sample chapter and we should write a

947
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:42,800
chapter outline and a perspective sample chapter and she bought each of us a compact computer this

948
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:50,640
is just before Macintosh came out but there were there were slightly portable computers so I

949
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:58,239
took one with me to Stockholm and by the time I finished writing my sample chapter I thought this

950
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:05,920
is more work than I want to let myself in for but we sent the material in and in December Diane

951
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,920
called up she said the reviewers all liked what we've written and they thought we ought to go ahead

952
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,680
so they wanted to sign us for contract so I thought oh god what do I do now and I called Ken

953
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:24,239
and he said oh yeah I think it's terrific let's go so there was no alternative and we went ahead

954
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:30,720
with it and many times during the writing process I thought I was crazy to get involved in this

955
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:41,600
if I could quit I would but in retrospect I'm glad that we stuck with it and it took a long time

956
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,400
because it was 1984 that they first started talking to us about the book it was really 85 when

957
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,800
we signed the contract and then I had a lot of things that got me behind schedule when I came

958
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:03,360
back from sabbatical and we didn't really plan to end our work on an any kind of schedule basis

959
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:13,279
till spring or so of 1986 but we had the first draft done maybe in spring of 88 no it must have

960
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:17,599
been eighty-six I don't remember the dates now because it took a year or so to produce the book

961
01:46:17,599 --> 01:46:23,759
after the after the chapter drafts were done so the whole thing was about a almost five year

962
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,839
process and the subsequent additions were much easier

963
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:38,239
was it a bit more process to establish the point of view of the two authors that you're going to be writing the book down?

964
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:47,119
Actually that was the easiest part. Ken and I split up responsibility for chapters very easily

965
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:53,039
we agreed to read each other chapters I did most of the metabolism he did most of the structural

966
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:58,319
biochemistry and we sort of split the molecular biology the genetic biochemistry and

967
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:07,039
the editors were very concerned about merging our our prose styles I think we did pretty well

968
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:14,159
although now that I'm I'm writing some for our fourth edition which he's not involved in I'm

969
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:20,000
writing some rewriting some chapters he wrote and I'm seeing some differences between his writing

970
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:31,199
style and mine but the difficulty we had in the first edition was some pretty spirited arguments

971
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:36,880
with our editors they kept a pretty heavy hand on us and we disagreed with him pretty frequently

972
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:43,680
but they ended up being pretty good friends and we had a different editorial team each with each

973
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:52,720
of the editions but that was where the energy came out but Ken and I had nothing but a good

974
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:59,200
relationship the one thing that was a disappointing was that he spends almost half the year at his

975
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:04,640
summer home in Woods Hole that he established when he was at the University of Illinois before he came

976
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:10,000
here and that's chooses so it wasn't always a matter of just walking down the hall if I wanted to talk

977
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:19,359
to him but he worked out pretty well it did pretty well I can't tell you how much

978
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:27,600
the percentage of the market had captured but the publisher very pleased the terms of the royalties

979
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:35,920
we were very pleased and I've been told by quite a few people I mean this is not something I should

980
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:40,239
be talking about but I've been told that that is the most clearly written book on the market

981
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:49,520
and I know it it it brought us a lot of attention I know when I was in sabbatical leave in Sweden

982
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,800
I got a call one day and from someone at the University of Uppsala they wanted me to come

983
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:59,920
and meet with a group of their biochemistry teachers to tell them my thoughts about teaching biochemistry

984
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:08,159
I gave a talk in South Africa a few years ago and they're biochemistry meeting and the

985
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,440
students were coming up and wanting to be photographed with me because they'd used our book so a lot

986
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:18,960
of things happened that were very gratifying to the ego so from that standpoint I guess our book

987
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,960
was received well enough that it was worth the effort and worth the effort after the project I

988
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,840
thought was dead after the 30th edition was done that it was worth picking up for the fourth edition

989
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:36,000
as you look back on your career what are some of the things you have published of

990
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:49,600
I guess the first thing is the fact that I trained 35 PhD students and most of them have done

991
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:57,840
very well on their careers and that's like being a parent and most of them stated enough contact

992
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:05,280
that I had the feeling that I that I made a difference in their lives another thing that I've

993
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:11,920
been satisfied with is maintaining a balance of teaching and research through all the positions I've

994
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:24,079
had because I always enjoyed teaching I'm pretty enthusiastic about the field I like to know

995
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:28,079
what's going on the field I like to explain it to others whether it's in writing or speaking

996
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:37,359
and I like to set an example for colleagues who might be focused only on their research

997
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:46,000
that you can be a successful research scientist and still maintain personal communication with

998
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,639
students with colleagues with people in other departments on the campus that science can be a

999
01:50:52,639 --> 01:51:02,559
social activity so I would say the breadth of interest and association that had something else I

1000
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:10,080
take satisfaction in and being able to say funded for years in a very difficult increasingly

1001
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:19,120
difficult environment and the book I mean that's pretty big part of my life put pretty big strain

1002
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:26,320
in our family situation for a long time but now Kate is just she just as supportive about the

1003
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,840
whole thing as I am she likes it when I come home and tell her stories about the experience that we had

1004
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:41,680
and so it's been a big plus also. Is there anything to read next that we should pass on?

1005
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:52,800
Well yeah I guess there's always been the thought about what again parallel lies parallel universe

1006
01:51:52,800 --> 01:52:04,960
universes what if I go on into medicine and that's hit it several times when I was in college

1007
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:10,239
trying to decide which way to go of course my father was a doctor I thought the world of him

1008
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:16,079
and I talked and I catered and you know maybe we could go out of practice together

1009
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:26,720
and that could have been fun but dad was very good about not putting pressure on he said it was

1010
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:34,239
my decision whether to go on to science or medicine and you asked about the Reed College culture

1011
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:40,800
earlier and Premeds were sort of frowned on as being grade lovers even though Reed gave grades

1012
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:46,000
but the students weren't we weren't told what the grades were and the idea was to make you less grade

1013
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:52,640
causes but the Premeds were a little more narrow and they were interesting and I saw there was

1014
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:57,440
something about the culture that the that the highest level of acceptance was the people that wanted

1015
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:04,720
to go on into university and college professors so that helped and then I was pointed in that direction

1016
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:11,360
but when I went to Arizona and started teaching medical students I realized that biochemistry in that

1017
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:19,760
context is a lot different and my father actually never actually conveyed to me the intellectual

1018
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:28,960
stimulation of medicine as a multi departmental scientific activity it was partly that he was in

1019
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:36,000
and practiced he was an internist but a lot of his patients were they just had routine troubles

1020
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,800
that didn't give him much stimulation so he didn't convey that part of it but once I had to learn

1021
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,800
to teach biochemistry in a way that medical students would accept and once I started

1022
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:55,520
interacting with him the college I realized that that medicine is a lot different from what I thought

1023
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:04,480
was and so at some point after I'd been there a few years early 70s I read that the University of

1024
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:14,640
Miami had created a fast track MD program for PhDs in the biomedical sciences you could finish

1025
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:20,560
a MD degree in a year and a half to two years I was pretty interested in this so I applied for it

1026
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:28,400
and it was accepted and then I went to talk to the department chairman the idea being that

1027
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:34,240
one of the years I could get partial support by being on sabbatical leave and then we'd use our

1028
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:39,600
own resorts for the rest and when I told him about it he looks though he'd been kicked in the stomach

1029
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:49,680
and then he he talked to my colleagues which I always felt was improper I thought that my

1030
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:55,280
conversation was just one on one but after a week he said that the department had decided they

1031
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:00,480
they really didn't want me to do this well obviously I could have done it anyway but I would have

1032
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:08,000
had to resign I could have resigned you know I thought it over and by that time our children were

1033
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,640
date and ten we were pretty well settled and two son and there wasn't any and I enjoyed what I

1034
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:23,280
was doing there wasn't any real there wasn't any reason that I had to do this but I've always wondered

1035
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,400
what it would have been like if I'd if I'd had a current medicine would I have gone into medical

1036
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:35,920
research or would I have been a primary in practice would I have gotten the intellectual stimulation

1037
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,240
would I've enjoyed the kind of breadth the awareness of what's happening and cutting edge science

1038
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:46,399
and all the rest of it being ice if you could live too large but that's something I just have to

1039
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:55,679
live with I guess so obviously we're also very proud of our two children Lawrence who was as I

1040
01:55:55,679 --> 01:56:01,279
said was born very shortly after our marriage and then Anne and was born a couple years later

1041
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:08,479
Lawrence ended up going to the University of Washington for a PhD in biochemistry so he was

1042
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:14,799
in the same department I was and the department had changed a lot since then he's now out of

1043
01:56:14,799 --> 01:56:20,559
science but he got a great start to his career he did a post-doc in Sweden and then a second post

1044
01:56:20,559 --> 01:56:26,000
doc in the Sock Institute and he did a piece of work that made him quite well known he had

1045
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,959
four excellent faculty offers and he was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan

1046
01:56:30,959 --> 01:56:38,000
for several years and he had an epiphany and now he's a teacher in the Waldorf school system

1047
01:56:38,799 --> 01:56:44,319
and then we'll go into detail about that but he is much happier doing that than he ever was

1048
01:56:44,959 --> 01:56:51,679
as a university faculty member and our daughter graduated from Oregon State with a degree in psychology

1049
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:56,399
and no clue to what she wanted to do and she happened to talk to a

1050
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:04,799
naval recruiter on campus and ended up going to naval officer candidate school after she graduated

1051
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:14,320
and becoming an incident and she had a she did very well in the Navy but she ended up secretly

1052
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:19,520
getting married to an enlisted man under her command and that was a no-no in the Navy and when

1053
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:25,920
they found out they were both in trouble and again making a long story short they both left the Navy

1054
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:31,360
and the Anne was in the reserve she got promoted in the reserve so she was in good standing as far

1055
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:37,439
as the Navy was concerned but they had two children and she was basically sock her mom

1056
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:43,119
until her two daughters were in college and then she went back and got a degree as a

1057
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:50,319
paralegal assistant so she's working in that field so both of our children are doing things they

1058
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:56,159
enjoy a great deal each of them has two children who've done very well and so that's something

1059
01:57:56,159 --> 01:58:04,479
that Keaton I can look at with some satisfaction also
