1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,179
Okay, I'll if you could please introduce yourself your name in today's date and

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:09,759
our location. I'm Albert C. Par where we're at our home in

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,000
Gresham, working on these two at Avenue and the day to date I believe is the 18th

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,620
is 18th of June 2014. Terrific. Well we'll start at the beginning of your

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,960
born in, is it to Lee, Utah? To Iowa they call it to Utah. Yeah. So what was your

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,240
family doing there? My dad was working in the copper mines and a big army

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,240
depot at the two-o-ordinance depot during World War II and after the war ended

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,320
decided he wanted to leave Utah and move up to Oregon where his brother was

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
family was in Rosbury. So we moved to Rosbury I think in 1946 something like that

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,000
in 1946 or early 1947 and that's why I went to all my schooling and grew up

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,560
there in Rosbury. Did you have siblings? Yes I have one brother and my

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,640
older brother and an assistant for this four-year shelter and they all they both

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,120
live in the state. My sister lives in Canberra, my brother lives in Lake

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,640
Grover Lake, Oswigal. So your dad was in the copper mines originally but I

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,299
understand he was in the forest products industry. He worked in the saw mills

16
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,140
and plywood mills in the Rosbury area and eventually ran a film station for a

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,739
while and some other things just sort of retired as a handyman and mechanic.

18
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:31,299
It's a place in Rosbury. Growing up in Rosbury, did you have any, do you have

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,420
memories of the temper culture at that time? Yeah there was a lot of, you know

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,579
that's what made the the the world hum down there and in those days they were

21
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,299
still giving a lot of those first growth trees and it'd be Douglas Firs and

22
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,060
you take up a whole logging truck the diameter would be and you'd see those

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,899
coming down the road and the road is of course really very primitive up in the

24
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,099
mountains there's a lot of them are at least gravel not paid but it was very

25
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:58,259
primitive but there was a that's what that was almost excuse me. There's also a big

26
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,579
farming industry in Rosbury in the garden valley a vegetable farming can't

27
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,500
load beans that sort of thing. There were a lot of less kids in a junior high

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,419
school high school worked in the farms in the in the valleys there and in the

29
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:16,659
Rosbury area. That's why I started working in the farm areas to

30
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,699
say about my new good working state. So what kinds of jobs did you do? Well I

31
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:26,339
started in junior high school picking beans the pole beans and then eventually

32
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:32,579
got a that was by a profound sort of job and then eventually I got a job by the

33
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:36,579
hour sort of an overseer of that and also the

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,620
and then soon summers and running in Camel fields and the guy worked

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,380
for about 25 acres of Camel open to make those strawberries that sort of

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,660
thing and I would work all from me a spring on through the late summer we fall

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,140
after school and on the weekends for the farmers. Was there much smag

38
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,140
and labor in the area at that time? Not much at all very very little

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,060
in fact that's why the school based the road the school busses downtown and

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,060
all kids after work in the fields and I don't think that's done anymore.

41
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,219
I think the children don't want to work out in the hot sun but that's what it used to

42
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,659
be done back in the 50s and 60s that had never before that. It was

43
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,939
getting it get yourself into the school and the school busses load up and go to

44
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,460
the various bean fields and then you work all day they bring you back to the

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,340
school and you could get yourself home somehow. What do you remember about your

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,180
dad's work in the song mill? I mean what was it a typical work experience

47
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,060
like for him? It was very hard work and of course the mills were not the

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,379
air condition or heated or any of that nature and so it was hard it was hard

49
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:46,099
dirty work and not the safest thing in those days either but it was very

50
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,620
labor intensive you know all the work was done by hand and of course power

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,219
solves that sort of thing but you walk into a modern plywood mill you know

52
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:00,260
there's very few people and it's all automated but most days everything was

53
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,060
done by hand including making the plywood sheet you know layer by layer

54
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,620
like I had a job one summer after in college working in a plywood mill

55
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,579
it was my job to make the plywood it started out with the big flat piece a

56
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,539
four-bake piece and put the machine just spit out glued cross pieces to

57
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,939
even slap those down some water then flop another the other sheets on and

58
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,659
physically built the piece of plywood with your hands and stacked them up and

59
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,620
put them in a big hot press and press them and started another batch

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,780
but it was all hand labor you see including you know they do the glued pieces

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,900
and all parts of the process were had so they employed a lot of people

62
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,700
compared to what now they do sounds a little repetitious yeah it's boring but

63
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,740
it was good money you know for a kid in those days how about she might have what was

64
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,340
her background she was a school teacher and so since we moved to to Rosberg she

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,340
got a job in looking glass so teaching there in looking glass and would go out

66
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,939
every day during the school year and so we were very young so we were we had

67
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,540
often had babysitters and that sort of thing and then eventually she moved to

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,780
the Rosberg school system and retired for 30 years or whatever that was Rosberg

69
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,500
going up for you I loved it it was a you know safe place to be

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,540
and had a lot of friends there still do so have my road road contacts and

71
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,819
we we I liked it the weather was nice and it's a lovely place to live and of course

72
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:40,180
a small town but I hope you're you know very fond memories of it really great

73
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,379
place schools were good and so everything did everything to recommend it in my mind

74
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,939
what were your hobbies as a boy what'd you do for fun?

75
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,740
I was pretty busy working we lived on a small farm so we had a lot of animals that

76
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,420
always had pigs and chickens and now occasionally a cow on a steer and that sort of thing

77
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,500
so busy with that sort of thing and then hobbies as I got over was cars got real

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,220
interested in hot rod racing and a bunch of us would you know run these hot rods you'd see back

79
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,899
in the 50s and drag race on the on the roads and that sort of thing but that had a good time but

80
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:25,539
it was entertaining it was a nice place to grow up how about your experience at school

81
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,299
the Rosberg had good schools in those days and I presumably still do and so it was I learned

82
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:40,500
a lot I was a for a few years for a few years of my school I didn't take schooling very seriously

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,419
and I you know got by but and nothing to nothing to do brag about academic excellence but

84
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,259
by the time I got to high school and later on and I started taking school and we're

85
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,819
seriously worked on getting good grades and that sort of thing but again they they were very

86
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:01,460
tolerant and I was active in student government in high school and and so on so I had a good time

87
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,780
I enjoyed I looked back with the high school with with Creek Fawn this I saw a lot of friends from

88
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,660
from the Rosberg graduating class and I see them and I was just talking to one on the phone this

89
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,020
morning it'll buddy from Rosberg so the you know you know friendship lasted you know it started

90
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,420
and laughed the last of lifetime you know from from your high school experience I see the

91
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,660
education was an emphasis in your family yeah I heard from the time I was very small that you want

92
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,660
to work hard so you can go to college and my dad would always say so you don't have to work in the

93
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:40,100
mills like I have to work and I want you to work in the mills you could see what he met and so

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,660
what it was a good impetus working in the mills and in hard labor on the farms that there might be

95
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,860
a better career perhaps more in terms of ease but also security because the mills are always

96
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,580
having strikes where there was before the union really got strong and that people get laid off

97
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,780
and it was not the most secure environment so a lot of anxiety but for my father and the other

98
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:13,139
parents as well because of the changing nature of the scene in terms of the the mills and who

99
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,979
was oh who won't this one they buy some mills and everybody get fired and so on and it was a

100
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:24,019
I could understand why my father was always apprehensive it was a uncertain time

101
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,339
how did you develop your interest in science I was always fairly good at it always a math and

102
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:39,620
science things always came easy to me it's just one of my abilities and I did well at it and I

103
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,139
just got I was always interested in how things work I built radios from time I was like a teenager

104
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:50,660
and you could interest in radios not let it interest you know in physics and electronics and

105
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,900
always had that interest in high school then when I went on to college that was the first thing I

106
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,579
you know thought about it as having a major in terms of physics and math so it's a it's just a I

107
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:12,500
think things sort of select you by your abilities some people have great musical skills and other

108
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,500
kinds of skills language skills and there's some of us who have math and science skills it just

109
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,539
attributes and interest to and from believer in that there's dispositions and characteristics of

110
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:31,460
people that a lot of them to succeed because some people no matter how hard they work have a

111
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,100
very difficult time with mathematics I would see that when I was teaching and there wasn't that they

112
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,139
were you know necessarily stupid people learning of that nature just they didn't have those those

113
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:46,179
particular abilities in perhaps interest with abilities and so people tend to end up I think

114
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:52,739
and things if they're going to be successful that they have good abilities like that's what worked

115
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:57,779
out for me and you know was there anybody who during your high school time was a mentor for you

116
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,019
or somebody who got interested in these things or do sort of my marriage from within I had a

117
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,139
series of very good science teachers in high school physics teachers and chemistry teachers and

118
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:14,740
math teachers I might add that always encouraged and encouraged the students and then kept you on

119
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,659
the straight now in terms of the learning did a good job so I think the I had the benefit of a

120
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:28,019
bunch of good teachers most of the more veterans from World War II that when the ones I can remember

121
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:34,180
that had gotten to school in the GI building and went into education they were they were really

122
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,220
excellent teachers a lot of benefit to us of students we went to Oregon State College beginning

123
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:49,940
in 1960 how did you decide to go to OSC I had a scholarship from the from the maybe and

124
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:57,060
was in our TC scholarships and that was the place that had that program also I wanted the major

125
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,460
in the science program for Georgia State was a natural choice and they had the in our TC scholarship

126
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:12,580
as well so it was a confluence of events and interest as well as so this a little scholarship aid was

127
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:19,620
were you in in our OTC in high school or no no no not at all but there was one of those exams you

128
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,660
take and you selected and so on I know it was a competitive thing so that was part of your

129
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,660
experience then in college was being in in energy in our TC yes yes I was in that for two and a

130
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:38,339
half years then I decided that it would be better for me to continue in science for the

131
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:46,179
continues the Naval Officer and disenroll from that program just to sit my time in the science

132
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:52,259
program what did that program entail for you the in the Navy program that would entail the summer

133
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,179
cruises you would after your freshman year you went on the camp pedal tendent some other places

134
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:05,939
than after the sophomore year we went to Texas for a while at Air Force that Air Force based on

135
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:12,739
the Corpus Christi and then another month or so at San Diego and so it's good to realize

136
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:19,299
experience I really think well those experiences in the Navy in the summer programs and then if I

137
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:24,339
had stayed in the program the third year after your junior year you'd be going to onboard a ship

138
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,220
as some sort of capacity but I never never went that far I put some type of my junior year

139
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,500
was there training during the school year two years? Oh yes did the regular RCC program I think

140
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,420
it was you had to regular class three times a week then one one day there was a drill

141
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,500
where you had to read out it was a marching outside down there all those fields were

142
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,900
other buildings was down there the quants of that building really? There's still the same building

143
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,659
handle it's like down there by the Colosseum and so forth it was the same building then and those

144
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:03,779
were World War II quants that hosted so it's amazing it's still standing with all those

145
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,939
fields were all vacant there there's not a letter the development that's we'd be out there marching

146
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:12,500
endlessly it's same yeah yeah there used to be quite a few of those quants at that time campus

147
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm sure you saw yeah yeah well what do you remember about you sort of your first impressions of

148
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,740
of college and of corralis? I liked it I was uh when we got there I was selected to go into some sort of

149
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,820
they were trying to move living living arrangement programs and they were also getting started

150
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:41,059
what they called an honors program at that time and I was enrolled in that and they put people

151
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:46,820
in that honors program as your freshman the whole four on the first four cauthern hall I believe

152
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,620
he was cauthern hall all four four were so people that were chosen for this honors program and

153
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,660
and they encourage extra cultural activities and and they had advisors and and so forth and it was

154
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,860
it was a pretty much a pretty nice bunch of of fellows who would you know well fairly successful

155
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,580
in high school and we were then selected for this this honors program arrangement I don't know

156
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,940
if they still do that or not I have my idea but it was a I was a introductory program so the people

157
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,220
that we were my roommates and then the people and the hall were pre selected out by by someone in

158
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,100
the university as a part of this honors program that tests to have the better students in one

159
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,740
location the people they perceive to be better students really ultimately turned out or not I

160
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,060
don't know but that was that was the idea of the time and there was extra curriculum activities as

161
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,700
well yeah and then the honors program you took an addition to your regular courses there was

162
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,379
at least one seminar a week of a you know small small bunch of people even sometimes one on one

163
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:50,500
with one of the professors working on projects I found that very beneficial I worked with

164
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,820
biology botany and botany professor once in physics professors and entomology so it was

165
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:04,259
interesting time and did that every year for your whole four years and then you

166
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,340
would when you graduated you get an honors designation on your diploma interesting see you're

167
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,059
helping assist with their research yeah you would do and then do the little projects on your own yeah

168
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:20,500
and it was it was it was always sort of interesting and then just talk about

169
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:27,139
you know their field of research and then trying to learn a little bit a little bit about it

170
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,899
but it was a broadening experience yeah but you got to work sort of one on one with with the

171
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:40,340
faculty members or in some cases my physics program was working with a senior graduate student but

172
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:47,139
coming once a twice a week and we were working on projects and the physics program yeah that's

173
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,899
I'm interested to hear you talk about this though there was I've known that honors program

174
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,699
apparently it started right around the new started it was cut as a result of out measure five

175
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:59,939
in the early 90s and then was replaced by the University Honors College which came about five

176
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:05,300
years later it sounds like it's a little different yeah but your experience was yeah it was uh

177
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,740
you they they in some of the class of the segregated in terms you know the people in the honors program

178
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,220
but by and large you just mess with with everybody else and then and did these extra things

179
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,140
with the seminars you know one or three are seminar credit course and get credit for them as well

180
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,340
it was a main main experience was being able to work with one on one with a with a researcher

181
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:37,860
or some sort and and explore new areas so it was a very beneficial so when you went to college

182
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,819
you have a sense of what you wanted to do in terms of your studies because as a turn of that you took

183
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:48,019
it I've looked at your academic records you took a lot of classes and to get two degrees in four

184
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,899
years was that your plan from the beginning I sort of liked it because I was the the math and the

185
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,779
physics were happened to be easy for me and the things that caused me trouble were the foreign

186
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,259
language requirements that you know that was really hard for me it's been probably more time on

187
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:09,940
French when I was taking it then I then I did on the physics courses because it's just different

188
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,539
abilities but no I just really liked the physics course I took as much as I could now select the

189
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:21,700
math courses but I'd taken a lot of math in high school I really liked it and they had some good

190
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:28,500
professors too in both departments it was it was a fun and fun environment so I looked back on

191
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,299
my days both at undergraduate and graduate school with great farmers because I enjoyed it and

192
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,019
it was hard work and so forth was really a nice time you were doing something you really wanted

193
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:45,299
to do and able to do and sort of free from the necessities that happened to make a living otherwise

194
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,659
and work in a workplace and so on it was the time of your life and a pro long time in my case

195
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:54,980
that went on to graduate school where you were doing exactly what you wanted to do and that's a

196
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:02,099
that's a real good feeling it's very very good for the soul did you have a sense of a

197
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,180
particular specialty within math or physics at that point in your life or that you know I did not

198
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:13,379
know but then in fact the curriculum was sort of everybody took the same thing there were a few

199
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,860
electives like in physics you could take it maybe into meteorology or something of that nature

200
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,580
or ocean sciences was getting started back that some people would maybe take a few of that but

201
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,580
by the large the physics curriculum was pretty well fixed and since I was getting a math major

202
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,420
too I didn't have a lot of a slop I had to take the you know the required courses and and to fill

203
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,980
the the social science requirements as well and I think that PE requirements in those days too

204
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,819
that you had to take some of your classes in yeah I don't know if it was still current when you

205
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,860
were in school you used to have to learn how to swim in order to graduate yeah and that was that

206
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,380
was yeah you had to take a swimming course and those days and I I always thought it was awful

207
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:04,740
they no swimming suits you swam nude and I thought that was just a trotious I mean there's no

208
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,779
earthly sense in it there's just some very peculiar people running the swim program in the athletic

209
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:18,019
department I think that was my that was always my opinion they just strange folks you're not the

210
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,859
first person to say that to me well were there any professors that made a particular impact upon

211
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:31,460
you that you can think of yeah I like the entomology professor I worked with John Latin I believe

212
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,299
was the same was was very influential got me interested in in in philosophy of philosophy of

213
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,579
science a whole range of things other than learning a bit very little about entomology but a little bit

214
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:52,019
and we had some good professors in the physics department too and enjoyed that a great deal

215
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:57,539
they were they were good because they were student focused and then he really got a chance to

216
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,740
have a lot of experiences with the teachers yeah Latin also was a book lecture oh I didn't know

217
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,339
that at the time yeah we have a Latin book collection that did you work while you were in school

218
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:16,740
yeah a sum the in our TC program catch kept you pretty busy but also leader on helped by

219
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,299
greeting papers and and that sort of thing for both the math department and the physics department

220
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:27,779
and that was a small amount of money but it actually helped but it's primarily in the

221
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,539
ingrowning papers and acting as sort of assistant to some professor and that sort of thing I didn't

222
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:40,819
you know working a restaurant or any that sort of thing well and when you were studying physics

223
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:45,700
especially I'm interested in knowing about the technologies that were important to students at

224
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,980
that point well we we had the technology of the 50s in the early 60s right and so there

225
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,059
there were a lot of old Hula Packard and Technonics measuring equipment that sort of thing and

226
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,100
the optic stuff was you know all the classical optics material and a lot of that's probably still

227
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:08,819
still the same because things like optics haven't the introduction of the laser and some of that

228
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,779
technology haven't changed that much so it lends us and that sort of thing you know probably the same

229
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:19,700
knowledge as they were then and that they had I think well equipped laboratories and for the time

230
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:26,180
and it was it was good yeah I'm always interested in knowing about the era before computers

231
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,619
and computers we know anyway yeah well there was none of that then the university had a computer

232
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:38,339
then and it was I started to take a computer course what I always thought this was sort of fun

233
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,099
showed up in this class and turns out most of the other people already knew what they were doing

234
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,699
and you know and so the professor was talking to them somebody like me it was just out the lunch

235
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:54,179
eventually I just quit the course because you know they need you to tell you where the computer was

236
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,859
and how you did anything they just started talking about a bunch of stuff that they were you know

237
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,500
more advanced it wasn't an introductory course at all which is what it was alleged to be

238
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:10,339
and so it was sort of a bad experience quite frankly my introduction to computers and they had

239
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:16,099
something that we were gonna save that time I have no idea it was I never personally sought because

240
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,819
I got out of the business and then really get started into computers till later in graduate

241
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:28,740
school in very late in graduate school and then like became a talk for a few years in Alabama

242
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,220
we started automating some some of our equipment then but it was still back in those those

243
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,819
they were like in the 60s it was still calotypes not sort of console it was a modems and very slow

244
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,980
I mean people just wouldn't recognize it now they wouldn't have the patience for it

245
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:53,140
did you so you lived in a dorm initially did you stay in the dorms all four years or no I didn't I

246
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,980
yeah that I I didn't really like the dorms because they're sort of noisy and I'm the sort of

247
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,980
person who really have to have a sort of quiet and it's a little solitude and the dorms were always

248
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:14,980
very very noisy so the second year I and a friend found an apartment over by the SAE house it's

249
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,460
the church it's a church said they want to be able to story house they rented out parts of

250
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:27,700
for students so my friend and I moved in moved in there and at that time that wasn't that wasn't

251
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:34,579
really allowed I mean you had an undergraduate who were supposed to live in student approved housing

252
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,259
well this wasn't student approved housing we just moved in there but eventually the dean caught

253
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:45,940
up with us the dean of men yeah send us letters which we ignored and so forth but if it's he came over

254
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:56,019
and not from the door I don't remember his name but he was a very nice man and we talked him

255
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,019
a while I told him I just you know we liked it there and it was and I was getting good grades and

256
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:05,620
being successful so it wasn't like we were and same with my roommate we're flunking out of school

257
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,779
something it was actually being quite successful as a living arrangement but so he blesses heart he

258
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:17,059
went next door or graduate student and his wife were living who I didn't know and got them to

259
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,819
sign that they would be our proctors or whatever they called it signed it that they would keep my

260
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:28,019
office and so then it became legitimate housing and I hadn't realized that it was a process to

261
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,740
to turn a living situation to university recognized but then that was the end of that never

262
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,700
anymore about it but when I stayed there for the next two years and the third year we up

263
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,819
I finally we lived a roommate and I lived in a place called Krobalas towers or something like

264
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:50,980
that it was a high-rise building at that time in Portland area I mean then in the Krobalas area

265
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:58,660
and that that was that was fine too but that first one was a sophomore when we ran into the dean

266
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,100
that's having a little concern but you know I was trying to do what I thought was best for me and

267
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:10,339
I'll find it but at that point this is still true to some degree but at that point the Greek

268
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:17,779
system was very big on campus and I'm wondering what it was like to not be part of that to have

269
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:23,459
tried to have a social life but not necessarily the engage with the Greek system we need to engage

270
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:26,740
with the Greek system not much I had some friends over in fraternity in fact I met some of the

271
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,139
fellows that lived across the street at the SE house and they were all fine we got long fine

272
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,460
there's no problems and we since I had I was doing a double major in health also working I

273
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,460
didn't have a lot of time for socializing and I'm not in those days I didn't think much of party

274
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,980
and carrying on like I emphasized I liked it quite so I could get my work done so I never really

275
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,060
thought about that the fraternities and they were a little more expensive too I think to live

276
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,780
than because by sharing an apartment the rim was relatively small another kind of shared the rent

277
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:06,339
and you did a lot of cooking and this food preparation and it was really fairly inexpensive I would

278
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:11,700
I would budget about a thousand dollars maybe eleven hundred dollars a year to go to work and

279
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,420
stay in those days and with a little judicious spending and care you could make almost that amount

280
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,700
in a summary of the working on the farms or plywood mill or a sawmill or something like that

281
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,860
nature and so you could quite easily work your way through school of course I had a

282
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,660
scholarship to the first two and a half years to pay the tuition and I think they gave us

283
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,580
fifty dollars a month for living to as part of that Navy program so it was you know small

284
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:44,580
stipend and so the financial aspects of going to college and in the 60s and in sort of the

285
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,779
earlier two were just not burdensome almost anybody with a will could could could go to any school

286
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:57,539
that they wanted the weather was you know Oregon University of Oregon or Oregon State or Southern

287
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:02,500
Oregon College in any school because you could work your way fairly straightforward now I think

288
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:10,339
that's not quite probable likely not possible did you have any major extracurricular activities that

289
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:18,180
you did during during college not much except the that played you know tennis and things like this

290
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,340
with with friends but I didn't during a lot of clubs or anything of that nature because you

291
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,420
know it's pretty busy and they focus on my my activities but a lot of friends we did think we'd

292
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,259
often you know have your your 49 out of the bar down there the peacock water reason one was bars

293
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:42,019
down there and and have a good time and that that was it but I didn't join but didn't during a lot

294
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:47,700
of clubs or anything of that nature to any particular hangout besides the peacock

295
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,539
not really but of course everybody you know would have a few beers on the only

296
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:01,380
close check if you got away to get it even though it's not not not legal in many respects but

297
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:09,700
students as always are inner pricing and and was never a problem well I ask you about a few

298
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,380
events that happened at Oregon State when you were there the first one in 1961 Oregon State

299
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,420
College began Oregon State University that made much of an impact on you to be memory of that

300
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,620
I have remember and I and the people there thought it was a big deal I remember everybody being

301
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:32,900
enthused about it because I guess and a lot of people's minds the the name university has more

302
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:40,580
prestige and meaning than in college and I guess it does personally at that time I I didn't care

303
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:45,460
that much as I recall because you know I had known as Oregon State College OSC you know

304
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,699
as a high plus where I applied it didn't mean a lot to me in terms of a blade of things because

305
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:58,819
whether degree whether your degree said Oregon State College or State University to me it didn't

306
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:05,379
mean very much but you know to some people and I can understand it it did mean a lot to them

307
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,860
because I think in the in the academic hierarchy being called a university is more meaningful

308
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:18,340
and you know college it's it's more restricted term doesn't imply the research and graduate

309
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,060
programs and so forth that you you think of in terms of the university and I think that was that was

310
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,860
the goal of course in October of 1962 is the Columbus Day Storm you remember that?

311
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:40,019
vaguely yeah and you know it's a bad storm and I didn't affect me in any way you know

312
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,939
directly we didn't lose any of our home or any of that nature you didn't grow awesome like the

313
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:50,500
parents and those were didn't have any problems and so I didn't it didn't drastically

314
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:58,019
drastically affect me in any way but they didn't get to it I don't get it you're a big flip-off

315
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,859
but Terry Baker won the highest trophy in 1962 as well do you remember the much hoopla or surrounding

316
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:07,859
that? oh yeah there was a lot of hoopla and he was a great athlete because he was a he started

317
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:14,980
in the basketball the basketball as well and I didn't know him personally of course but he was

318
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,259
famous in his own time and I used to go to football games and they I think the students got in

319
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:27,139
you know free or or all those stuff and if there was it was a game you know it's not otherwise

320
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,940
engaged I try to get down to watch right I enjoy football it's the one sport I do care for I

321
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:38,580
and not really a basketball or baseball fan that much but I do like football and so I go some of the

322
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:48,100
games but in all the hoopla associated with it so I enjoy the athletic teams well what was your

323
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:55,300
sense of corral at the time somewhat smaller place than it is now obviously any particular

324
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:01,220
relationship with the town I like Corbalacy was the the people were friendly and nice and

325
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:09,779
there there there wasn't a crime to speak of and you know I'd read my bicycle outside in my

326
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:15,700
in my house or the apartment where I lived I I never had a stolen and this sort of thing and

327
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,659
never had a stolen from in front of a building or anything like that so yeah I enjoy I have no

328
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,140
negative memories of it at all of course they it's a lovely campus I always thought Oregon state

329
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,900
had a truly lovely campus in spring when everything's in bloom and the landscaping is it's really

330
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,460
really nice and in those days they didn't have all those cut streets all the streets went through

331
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,940
and you didn't have all the limited access that you have now and but parking was critical I mean

332
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,980
it was not easy when I lived my part I got an apartment system problem without in the dorm you had

333
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,700
to park way down there by pass the tennis course by the call seam and walk across the fields and

334
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,059
so forth there was no parking close by so it was inconvenient for some of the cars in those days

335
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:08,099
but yeah it was I like Corbalacy it's a lovely little town and it's sort of a nicer place to live

336
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:13,299
than why you ended up going to grad school and then South Chicago I mean night and day I was sure

337
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:19,779
yeah I'm sure of that well that brings us to this sort of the next section of your life you

338
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:24,980
graduated in 1964 from Oregon state how did you decide what you're going to do next?

339
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,539
well I had decided back in my junior year when I got out of the Navy that out of the NROTC

340
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:40,419
program that I wanted to go on to get a degree of PhD in physics and do research and work at

341
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:47,539
research labs but I really liked that and so I applied to graduate schools and I was interested in

342
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,620
after getting away from the West Coast so I applied to the University of Chicago and a couple

343
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:59,140
of schools out of West here I don't remember I think Berkeley and University of Washington and I got

344
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:07,060
accepted by the University of Chicago and they offered me a research of fellowship and and

345
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,139
assistantship so that covered the education of course they paid the tuition to so I was able to go

346
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:18,740
to the University of Chicago you know actually by the time I finished I was saved up a little money

347
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:28,740
that's where I met my wife too as a Chicago in 1966 so it was it was a it was an applied

348
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:35,859
by Joe Chicago's mother's it's a good school and the financial aid package was very generous I

349
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:41,219
thought and it was a different part of the country it was interesting to move out to another part

350
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,379
of the country and what's certainly different I mean it was a it was a real lesson to me never

351
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:50,019
having been to Chicago I didn't interview the school or anything like that I got accepted and I

352
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:54,899
I don't know 57 Dodge Station working at the time I loaded up all my stuff and drove across Montana

353
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:01,379
and on down into into Chicago and right there and I wondered you know what's going to survive because

354
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,700
it's a very different environment yeah tell me about that transition you're living in a major

355
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:14,740
city living in a I have a rough part of a major city yeah it was yeah the South South Chicago was

356
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:23,140
in a transition from a widely white Polish Irish community to primarily black or African American

357
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:28,740
and then there was all those problems associated with that in terms of you know the cultural clashes

358
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:35,619
and so you you you would see that frequently and a lot of you know racism on on both sides but

359
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:42,899
particularly as as as the population and pro population profile demographic change in these

360
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,779
neighborhoods there was a lot of trouble and people's minds anyhow and so it was it was an

361
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:54,659
interesting interesting things of course it's something you'd not exposed to an organ at all you

362
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,139
would never had any idea and so it was a from a town like Corvallis with a very few minorities at

363
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:07,139
least at that time good Chicago or in South Chicago you know somebody like me a white person was

364
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:14,420
a minority and it was it was a real experience and it gives you perspective on how minorities in

365
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:20,179
this country the kinds of perceptions they must have and some of their some of their

366
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:26,980
perplexions I guess what causes trouble and anxieties but it's a it's a good lesson I think for

367
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,980
everybody yeah well the University of engineering too was a world class university in the University of

368
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Chicago very high-powered in the sciences tell me a little bit about that atmosphere that you

369
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:45,779
you came into at that point it was it was it was it was very competitive I mean the students for

370
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:54,019
all you know you know very very bright I remember the chairman told me that everybody in the

371
00:35:54,019 --> 00:36:01,700
in the class had GRE scores in the 98 percentile above and and they were all really really really

372
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,700
successful successful students it was very competitive fortunately I my back on at Oregon

373
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:13,300
states sort of mean good said I had no problems with the academics and and work at that Chicago and

374
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:21,380
it was one well and made the normal course of events and graduated in a six seven years with a PhD

375
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:29,060
was a typical time for physics in those days at Chicago I think it some of the other majors take

376
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:38,500
it was less time but so I graduated in the early 1970 with a PhD I want to ask you about a

377
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,900
couple people that were there I believe when you were there that are big names the first is an

378
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,420
Indian fellow superb onion chundra shigar absolutely he's a great professor I had him for a

379
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:59,780
couple of classes actually and statistical physics and and and and atomic and molecular physics quantum

380
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:07,139
mechanics advanced quantum mechanics and he was a brilliant teacher and he would come in and just

381
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:11,779
started his lecture and had perfect handwriting on the board this this was the days of chalk boards

382
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:16,900
none of this said the stuff and no overhead projectors they had sort of thing with the

383
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,179
plastic blackboard we cite them up and down and fill up a room with that and he would start

384
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:29,779
precisely on time and then since and finish precisely on time noise with a coherent message and

385
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:33,699
as last few minutes would be a summary and then you could write all the summaries down on your

386
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:40,339
notes and then you'd you'd have the important elements of the conversation and the talk so

387
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:46,819
he knew he's a brilliant professor really a nice person a chemist Robert Mulligan won the

388
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:53,299
Nobel Prize in 1966 while you were there any member of that yes and I knew a new Robert Mulligan

389
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:58,019
he was in the same building as well I did my research and I would see him frequently he was a

390
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:05,300
who's an interesting man a brilliant brilliant chemist physicist and and and and particularly

391
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,579
from molecular physics and now he had a whole bunch of students and then post actually had a

392
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:16,980
large enterprise in those days doing spectroscopy and theoretical theoretical physics and so on

393
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,340
but he's a real quiet man and all of you know he's already all by the time I got to know him and

394
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,140
I didn't have any classes for him but he didn't teach much he was all just 100% research and of course

395
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,980
traveling a lot because he was his world famous but he had a dozens of people working in his

396
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,780
laboratories and then he rires the hall at a University of Caldwell in the space

397
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,539
well it sounds like a tremendously enriching environment or do you tell me about this or the

398
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:51,380
progression of your of your academic courses there your your research time yeah I work

399
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:59,700
I had my for shoot up there and then the fall of 64 I was assigned to work for a professor Mark

400
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:08,340
Ingram who did mass spectrometry and in chemical physics and and various sorts of instrumentations

401
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:14,180
look at properties of the top-income molecular systems and I worked in his lab as a research assistant

402
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:21,220
for the first couple years and in Chicago they had you had to take regular take physics courses and

403
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:25,459
I think of that nature as well as preparing for what they call an entrance exam or the

404
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:32,099
the candidate exam you usually took that at the start of your in the fall of your second year

405
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:40,579
that was a very very hard test the qualifier and so the first year graduate students would spend

406
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,379
huge amounts of time studying old tests and problems because it was a three-day test

407
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:52,180
you know with all problems I mean it was none of this motorable guess that was all problems to solve

408
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:59,940
and in all areas of physics and so you had to be well prepared and so on for sure I by pass that

409
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:07,380
the first time through and I was able to get my research started and that was also a test which

410
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,260
a lot of a lot of people didn't make it the first time they'd have to take away six months of year

411
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:18,660
taking again and then a lot that some people just left it was so daunting that they just left

412
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,220
but that's like a lot of universities have those sort of qualified exams and it's a it's a hurtlet

413
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,300
all people studying for an advanced degree have to overcome but it was it was taxing it occupied

414
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,620
each month your time and you just study it and then to to learn the material to pass those

415
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:44,420
exams it was rewarding too because there's a focus of your attention and you really didn't learn a

416
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,779
lot I mean if you took the right attitude so it's been a very very beneficial process as far as I

417
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:56,579
can say so I'm in favor of difficult exams I think that it focuses one's attention and

418
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:02,739
and and enables you to really really do learn some words and things well then I worked up

419
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,979
if I pass this qualifier exam then you could sort of a PhD program you couldn't formally start

420
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:13,619
until you pass that qualifier so you'd have to find some professor that would take you on and

421
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:20,259
then then it had some research project that you wanted to do and I chose to say with the guy

422
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:25,059
I'd worked as a research assistant because I was interested in the physics and then the programs

423
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:31,219
that he had and he also is a really nice generous man and he had a you know five or six graduate

424
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:36,099
students have a couple postdocs and it was it was a good learning environment so I elected to

425
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:41,539
stay there and worked on some problems in in photorodization we had machines that would generate

426
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:48,339
vacuum ultraviolet radiation and and use that radiation with monocromers dispersate and use

427
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:53,459
that use that radiation to study atomic and molecular systems you know ionize them and use the

428
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:59,219
mass spectrometer or spectrometer depending on to analyze those so reaction products from the

429
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:04,739
ionization process and it's the density things like cross sections and so forth for

430
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:12,259
reactions photon atom and molecule reactions and my work that did was to

431
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:20,980
look at ionization processes in rare earth elements the lathenites so things like

432
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,619
eropium and eterbium eropium and things of that nature we generated ovens made the

433
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:33,059
old metals room temperature so you have to make a oven and generate a atomic beam all this is

434
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,819
in vacuum of course the generator beam of those and intersect that beam with the with the light beam

435
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:44,339
and and and and to ionization process you start knocking off electrons and you can melder to

436
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:51,859
then the ion products is a function of wavelength of the light and determine its ionization potential

437
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:56,659
so we measured some of the ionization processes of these rare earth elements which hadn't been

438
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:02,339
done because it was prior to this difficult subsequent people did a lot of spectroscopy

439
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:06,739
others and they did much got much more accurate results but it's those kind of experiments and

440
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:11,139
it's sort of a lot of fun you had to build you learn how to build ovens a little high temperature

441
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:17,460
ovens and and intersect that with all in the vacuum system and intersect that with the light beam

442
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,859
and get the mass spectrometer which is a relatively large instrument to measure the ion products

443
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,820
and we also did some work with organic molecules which were a lot easier you just let them

444
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,260
they vaporize and you can get a lot of molecular beam fairly straightforward from what's per

445
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,700
organic molecule and study their processes and look at their dissociation processes as well

446
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:46,340
so we did studies of various kinds of molecules that we would look at their ionizations as well as

447
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:53,860
the dissociation processes how independent were you in in developing these topics was it something

448
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,180
where you you went to your mentor with this idea or was it the kind of get away around?

449
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,340
no you had to end with with professor Engel and you had to develop your own topic and then

450
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,420
convince him that this was something to do and he would support and that's what I did I was

451
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,660
interested in the these rare earths because there was some there was some interest in the scientific

452
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:22,099
community about some of their ionization properties and also some of the internal energy properties

453
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:27,460
of some of the organic molecules we studied people were interested in their internal processes

454
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:33,940
and then measuring their their energies if you will and because the internal energies of these

455
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,099
molecules determine how they combine with others and so on and so there was interest in

456
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:47,380
and getting things called heats of formation of molecule ions and so forth that we did some

457
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:53,219
studies on systems that were of interest for other kinds of chemistry because that told you

458
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:59,619
energy balances in these ion molecule reactions so we were engaged in that kind of research using

459
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:04,579
these four ionization tools and those days that four ionization studies was hard because you had to

460
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:11,380
laboratory light sources so these would be discharges pulse discharges with a high electrical

461
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:18,819
pulse in in a in a capillary tube filled with a rare gas usually or hydrogen subcases and

462
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:25,059
a lehelium and then you generate the helium would get excited and generate molecular helium

463
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:30,420
which would then dissociate because helium was an inner gas it doesn't form a molecule except

464
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,539
in excited states and that dissociation process is a mature radiation in the far old devilot

465
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:42,740
so we'd use that radiation and dispersive with the monocrominern and study these atoms and then

466
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:49,539
the ion molecules as well but subsequent you know by the time I left graduate school and in the late

467
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:56,420
60s and certainly now in the 70s on the development of synchrotron radiation and also laser sources

468
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,700
of a total surpland at that to do what we did in those days now you go to synchrotron

469
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:07,860
most likely it would be fairly straightforward but it was it was hard at in those days because of

470
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,700
the the technology available you're limited to laboratory light sources but now there's the

471
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,500
synchrotron radiation sources throughout the world in fact that one worked as a national institute

472
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,659
of hydrogen technology that was the reason they had a small synchrotron radiation source

473
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:28,420
at at the institute and we use that for atomic and like for physics studies

474
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:34,179
same kinds of basic technologies as I used in graduate school and instead of having these

475
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:39,940
discharge light sources like a neon bulb if you will you have these big big machines that

476
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:47,379
generated radiation from synchrotron radiation but then as far as graduate school goes you had

477
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,500
to divide your own projects and then you had to publish and then Chicago had a requirement

478
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:58,019
at that time that your thesis had to be published in the peer reviewed literature so I had to

479
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:03,619
prepare an article for the journal chemical physics and then once that was accepted that was

480
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:09,300
and now then you escape the the rigors of half to write a formal thesis that the paper that

481
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,260
you wrote got accepted in a peer reviewed journal was was basically your thesis you just bound that

482
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:20,820
and that was it and you were not after I wrote these tedious 300 paid thesis or something like

483
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,620
some some places required I thought it was a good idea because if you stop thinking about that's

484
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,100
what you want your researchers to do is be able to publish in the peer reviewed literature so that

485
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:36,020
that's I thought that was always a clever and insensible criteria and so it's something you had

486
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,020
to achieve but at least as graduate school in your guaranteed at least having one publication

487
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,940
to get you to degree were there any other folks within the department that emerged as being

488
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:53,860
important to you rememberable besides ingram or oh yeah I had some classes from a famous scientist

489
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:00,500
Greg Revenso and he was he was a very very good teacher of a no-world gentleman like a swisher

490
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:09,699
German and he was one of the founders of the quantum electrobynamics back in the 1940s and he was

491
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:19,059
he was a professor at Chicago at that time and also met I learned a lot from the technical staff

492
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:25,780
in the physics department of those days they had a wonderful electronic engineer that's I work

493
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:31,140
with developing building equipment and electronics equipment they had some wonderful people in

494
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,780
a machine shop because we had to make our own equipment we didn't you didn't go to a catalog and buy

495
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:43,460
a mass spectrometer or monocromber you made it yourself and so I learned machining techniques

496
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,700
and also got to be a fairly good heliarch welder because we dwell that the chambers the vacuum

497
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,340
chambers together and that sort of thing and the guys in the shop would teach you to do all that

498
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,100
so it was I thought it was fascinating I got to do all kinds of things that you know got paid for

499
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,860
as a student that I really enjoyed doing so it was it was a wonderful experience how the years of

500
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:12,019
Chicago were just really in my mind really really very good and additionally getting a family started

501
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:19,460
and so on it was a wonderful learning experience did you do any teaching uh case me how I would

502
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:26,260
teach a course but not for undergrad I teach some courses and people preparing for the basic

503
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:32,579
exam or the qualifying exam and assist assistant in some of the graduate courses but I never

504
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:38,019
I was never a recent teaching assistantship and in the sense of teaching the undergraduate courses

505
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:44,099
and so forth I was I avoided that and I was able to have a research assistantship or

506
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:49,779
and they were in the lab and never never got so much involved on the teaching side

507
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:59,619
Tell me about meeting Ruth 1966 that that was an interesting story we uh I was driving out to go to my

508
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:08,099
sisters wedding and she uh I had I was going to bring an Indian friend of mine guy from India

509
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:13,299
a menon was his name and he was going to ride with me and we were going to share expenses

510
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:18,420
well he was a far tougher businessman than I was and he determined since I had that it was

511
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,580
the time the dodge station wagon at the time it was room for others he went around I'd be

512
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:29,620
noticed to me and solicited other riders to go parts of the trip one guy came all the way to Eugene

513
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:36,820
I dropped him off on Eugene and but the Ruth uh rode with us uh with a friend to Cheyenne, Wyoming

514
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:44,500
and we let him off there and I had a menon had some financial reasons I don't know what it was

515
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:52,500
and uh and so I got to be a courier of people across the country to go on this trip

516
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,420
but the menon figure I think menon figures he saved himself a lot of money and he's turned to the

517
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:02,740
expressed so that's how I met Ruth and when I got back to Chicago right uh certainly you know

518
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:08,979
I've seen her turned out she lived in a place where I lived in an international house in Chicago

519
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:14,099
so we got together and we actually got married and she was a student I mean she was an undergraduate at the time

520
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:22,099
and you said you started a family yeah and daughter was born there or her son was born there too

521
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:29,939
and uh in Chicago hospitals so what was that like being a family man and a student at the same time

522
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:35,380
it worked out pretty well fortunately my wife was real capable and she she worked at some two at

523
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:41,460
a at a correspondence school they're called the American school and it was in fact it was a block

524
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,940
way from our apartment where we left and so she could go get papers and grade papers and work on

525
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,820
these correspondence courses and uh that turned out a source of income and uh and do that at home

526
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:57,460
she didn't have to leave it in so the the the the the the the child was was was watched at home

527
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:03,539
when we lived in student housing that was uh right on campus and fairly close so that's that worked out well

528
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:10,340
well you were in Chicago during turbulent times uh the 68 democratic convention is

529
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:17,300
you know well known as being uh uh sort of an iconic moment for that time period in that location

530
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:23,780
you have any memories of it was awful everybody's bad behavior contributed to a really awfully

531
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:30,100
vent i mean nothing no one can be proud of those days in my mind i mean the protesters are out of

532
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:37,460
line but they're in the in the Chicago case the uh police's response were totally out of line and i

533
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:42,580
think it was uh characterized as a police riot and i think that's about right now i'm a pretty

534
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,820
conservative fellow but i mean the the Chicago cops were were just uh were just not the best

535
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,340
i hope they've changed over the years but you know i got shaken down twice in my in my

536
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,860
usage of Chicago because i had an out of state plate uh license plate uh by by cops you want

537
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:06,900
to bribe for letting me off and uh it was uh it was not pleasant i mean it did but that's the way it was

538
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,940
and uh so it was uh not all cops obviously but it was a it was a corruption and they uh

539
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:21,139
they were they were not nice uh not nice to the protesters in those days in fact i was

540
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:25,860
i never went uptown to the uh to the where all the the convention was but i was just walking

541
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:31,220
back from the lab one night and uh there's some cop cars patrolling down there by the university

542
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:37,220
looking for students to to harass and uh i had to they you know well there there's a cop uh

543
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,820
they were followed but i could tell it was a cop by their plane clothesman and they were thinking

544
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,860
about harass me they're dragging by me as i was walking and and really checking me out i could tell

545
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:53,380
that they were they were not thinking good thoughts they they were down in the south side and i

546
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,019
suspect they wanted to get it on the actions their comments were having downtown and no no the

547
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:04,580
yeah yeah i i didn't like that that uh the the Chicago cops at that time i had to not a lot of respect

548
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:12,179
for them because of my personal experiences yeah well which made him work in in family probably not

549
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:17,059
a lot of free time but i'm wondering if there's anything about Chicago that made a big impact on

550
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:22,579
you and sort of a social or cultural way there's a lot of cultural activities and uh as a student

551
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:27,059
you don't have a lot of money but there are a lot of inexpensive things to do well the university

552
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:32,179
cargo is not far from the lake michica and so you can uh you can just walk down the lake and

553
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:37,219
have some beaches and and so forth there was a the Chicago museum inside the industry was very

554
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:43,779
close to the campus and that was a that's a wonderful museum and we'd go there frequently and they

555
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:51,219
had forest preserves in the outskirts of Chicago that were you know big parks and and so

556
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:55,859
with an eye and and would spend time there and the picnic and you know the summer so you wouldn't

557
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:01,460
go out there in the Chicago winter but it's a couple a couple of the guys i worked with in the

558
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:06,820
machinus and the and uh and uh and in case you go fishing and do something to that nature too

559
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,579
so it's uh it's a it's a it's an interesting environment Chicago it's very different from here

560
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:18,980
and uh it was a real cultural shot the other big thing that the white 57 Dodge Nadeau about had a

561
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:26,019
you know it was an organ car right and so the tires were bald and the battery was ancient and the

562
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:30,659
scissors are getting cold in November car winds start and then the first time i got a little snow

563
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:35,619
on the street you couldn't go anywhere because the tires I had no tread and of course the

564
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:42,099
I had a light windbreak kind of jacket and and it got cold and so that November December was a

565
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:48,259
hectic time i had to get the car up so i would run in the in the winter time and uh and go on the

566
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:52,980
roads as well as get some clothes that were appropriate for uh you know that 10 degree environment

567
00:55:53,219 --> 00:56:01,139
winds howling so that was a real real real real shocker in my first quarter i was living in

568
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:07,300
in Chicago i was living in an apartment in about 20 or 30 blocks from from what the university was

569
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:14,579
so i had to drive back and forth to school and i soon rectified that i got a room at the

570
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:21,380
international house for the second three quarters that first year and uh we'd say we were

571
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,340
walking back and forth to campus because driving in the and the winters with uh with an older car

572
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:32,660
is not the best way to get around it was interterranean community and also parking problems in cities

573
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:40,740
it was a bad move and of course i hadn't uh realized that uh my first apply in Chicago i had been smart

574
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,700
to arrange housing in advance i think it was like for a valet you could just find an apartment you know

575
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:52,019
oh that's a big city fine well it wasn't the case uh apartments the living arrangements were

576
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:57,619
were real scarce and it was so it took me a few days actually when i arrived there i'd say in a hotel

577
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:03,539
or someplace for a few days and i'd like to find an apartment it was a quite far actually far from

578
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:11,460
the university it was an interesting uh interesting learning experience well yeah and sort of the

579
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:17,300
continuing topic of cultural shifts he finished up in 1971 in Chicago and went to Alabama

580
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:26,900
tell me about that well i thought i wanted to be a teaching profession and a friend of mine

581
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:32,179
former graduate student who graduated went to the University of Alabama and got a pretty good grant

582
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:40,579
to get his research set up and and so they they recruited me as well to come down and get a research

583
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:47,779
project started i've been interviewed with them and also with a couple companies and decided

584
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,539
i was going to be interviewed with uh sanded oil as it's called s-sort and those days out in

585
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:59,380
in New Jersey and they offered me a job as well but it would have been an uh an area in New Jersey

586
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:05,380
i didn't think much of it besides i wanted to get teaching uh uh go and so i took a job as an

587
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,619
assistant professor at the University of Alabama so we lived in Tuscanos, Alabama for uh

588
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:18,420
1970 to the 78 years i guess it was and uh and then i went on sabbatical leave at the

589
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:25,460
bureau standards that was called in in Maryland and then they offered me a job and i decided that

590
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,460
whether it be at the National Bureau standards rather than back teaching and the research

591
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:36,019
opportunities were far better it was a it was a struggle at you know Alabama's good school

592
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:41,940
like in the other state school but it's uh in those days it was hard to raise money and uh

593
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:47,780
we thought it difficult to raise money uh you know from the foundations and so forth and

594
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,860
and and Alabama to get our research started we raised some we were fairly successful

595
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,619
let's turn to my Andrew Jason and I there were insurance and facilities there

596
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:01,220
but it was very very difficult he spent a lot of time uh just trying to raise money

597
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:07,779
and so on and uh and also the teaching mode was fairly heavy compared to most universities it was

598
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:14,500
two courses you had to have six contact hours a quarter and i didn't leave a lot of time for

599
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,219
for your research you just had to be being there all hours of the day and night so it was not

600
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:24,339
it was not the best research environment of course the thiever Chicago was a guy just

601
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:31,140
professors taught one course two out of the three quarters one quarter they taught nothing

602
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,900
i mean they didn't have any teaching obligations so i mean there's a big difference between the

603
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,740
research universities in your and your average state university i might just still have a way of

604
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,300
most state universities that professors will have at least two courses and that's very time consuming

605
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:50,740
and so uh the at the at the bureau standards was on sabbatical leave versus no teaching and

606
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:57,299
they were fairly well funded compared to what it was at the alabama and it was funded directly by

607
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:02,819
the government for government programs and so uh eventually i had gotten a position we acted

608
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:07,059
raised a lot of money you know because uh and bs even said government and organization

609
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:12,500
we did do work for other government agencies and so we did had programs that in the NASA and no uh

610
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,299
department and defense supported so i raised a lot we raised a lot of money from those agency but for

611
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,860
you know we'll be fine programs rather than you know trying some fundamental research program

612
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,340
like at national science foundation so it was a very different environment i actually sort of like

613
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:32,180
do a lot better yeah so was the the project the research topic in alabama was that or

614
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,460
it made most of the extension of what you had been doing in chicago yes i built a

615
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,820
i built a smaller version of what we had in chicago and we were going to do do small work on on

616
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:46,500
rare earths we got started on that and then all small organic molecules and uh i did just

617
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,659
gotten that project started when i went on sabbatical leave and the reason i went on sabbatical leave

618
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:56,260
was that uh somebody gave it a donation or some money came up somehow they're going to totally

619
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,699
renovate the physics billy everybody's going to have to move out all the labs are going to be

620
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:05,219
closed down so i says well what other than to sit here for a year i had an offer i had had an

621
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:11,059
offer to go to to Maryland and the national bureau standards to work with a team there in the same

622
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:16,579
kind of work uh a photo organization studies and so i i said well let's take a sabbatical leave

623
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:23,860
it's i want to work for them and uh you know it's just a sabbatical leave at the at the

624
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:29,779
bureau standards and then that first year i still be paid by uh by alabama and and the national

625
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:35,059
bureau standard sent them some money to you know to pay for my time it's called intergovernmental

626
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:41,539
personal act uh pointy and uh so i spent uh the first year there then i was going to go back

627
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,820
we were going to go back to alabama because we liked it that we had a nice house we'd build a nice

628
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:50,420
house and so forth but they they uh they sat they didn't get done with the renovation things

629
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:56,340
and go on so they're going to be out a second year so i they had asked me if i would like to stay

630
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:01,059
a second year at at the bureau standards i said okay so it worked out good then sometimes during

631
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:06,340
the second year uh early in the second year they offered me a staff position at the bureau standards

632
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:12,739
which was uh actually doubled my salary and and it was uh we were involved in in a research program

633
01:02:12,739 --> 01:02:18,019
i really liked and really had high national international profile and worked with about a

634
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:23,299
recent really top people and it was all research and there was no there's no teaching and no

635
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:28,659
committees and none of this uh my lot of fundraising in those days so uh it was a real opportunity

636
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:34,659
i thought it so i elected to stay at the bureau standards so we just never went back to alabama

637
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:40,819
but that was not the intention when we first went to to to get this for Maryland for the bureau

638
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:46,259
standards and was located what was your impression of the south when you were there and you said

639
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:51,619
i liked it it was the weather's awful i mean i i never got used to that they the you know the

640
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:57,539
starts in in May the hot humidity and you know it'll be in the 90s and you would you know by

641
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:03,699
human i mean 90 percent humidity not people here get off site if it's 40 percent humidity but uh

642
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:07,699
i mean it would be very very humid and it's hard to get used to i never really did

643
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:12,019
with everything in your house your carvings air condition you turn that air conditioning on and

644
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,019
layman like i say or sometimes i'm sorry by June and it would just be on until

645
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:22,179
October i mean it was uh to me it was very uncomfortable now the need is people going up in that

646
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:28,500
they they they don't seem to bother them but they you know you have to come accustomed to a bite

647
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,819
i never really climatized to that hot you imagine that's the only thing i do like about the

648
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:38,899
people were nice uh test glutes was a lovely little town it's no say there was a smaller town

649
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:43,539
bigger than corvallis but it was still it's a college town basic but and of course now it's

650
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:49,059
it's subsequently a lot bigger they put a car factory Mercedes are one of those companies put a

651
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:54,820
assembly plant there in in Alabama that's not far away so it's a lot of industrialization

652
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,980
so it's a change in barb just like a lot of college how about the culture of the area

653
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:08,099
it was uh it was very different i mean uh you know you normally think of it south as being real racist

654
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:14,820
well they they had their the old vestiges of segregation but it was to me it was less harsh in those

655
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:21,620
terms than what i used to see in Chicago who was really ugly in my mind in fact the first

656
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:26,100
department I ran into the guy says i'll give you a real good deal because i want a white guy live

657
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:33,380
in here oh i think i didn't i had no idea what the customer would do at all i'll take the deal

658
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,860
because i needed a place to say this is could you know i hadn't arranged the housing but they were

659
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:44,019
they were they were there was definite racism and you could observe it you'd see some of that in

660
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:49,619
Alabama but not to the extent the race it seemed more harmonious to me than the in the racial

661
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:57,780
relations in Chicago the events of the blacks and the whites and then in south now that other people

662
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,259
probably have a different perspective i know but i mean i didn't i didn't see the harshness that i

663
01:05:02,259 --> 01:05:09,860
would and they'll work uh things expressed that i saw in Chicago but just one man's take i think i

664
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:15,140
am sure other people i think i probably very different take on well one thing i'm sure that was

665
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:20,980
inescapable while you were there was was called football oh god i have one three national championships

666
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:27,380
during your time bear variant is the coach yeah it was they take football real seriously in the south

667
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,460
i mean the average we're going i mean they just live and die and and then you know place like

668
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:39,940
Texas too i mean just and Mississippi Louisiana all of that says it is the sport and they then they

669
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,300
really take it take it seriously and and Alabama has this constant feud with Auburn which is sort

670
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:52,820
of Auburn sort of the quote of working state is it's a land grab school i think and Auburn

671
01:05:52,820 --> 01:06:00,019
because it's in the city of Auburn but there's a fierce rivalry and it's been going off for years

672
01:06:00,099 --> 01:06:04,420
and years and and and and and it and it comes apart of the culture you can people that don't go to

673
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:09,780
the schools uh you know they're in Auburn and Alabama fan and you know they can be a mill worker

674
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:14,179
whatever you know i know they'll have their own laws these sort of unknown reasons i see some of

675
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:20,019
that in Oregon not but nice it's not it's not like it's just it's just pronouns but they do

676
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:26,739
they do take football seriously and bear Bryant was a really re-burd revered person i mean

677
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:36,819
people uh you had a lot of club i think for sure well you mentioned sabbatical and you started

678
01:06:36,819 --> 01:06:45,379
up full time at the national bureau standards in 1980 so i guess you can tell me a little bit about

679
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:49,859
moving to the DC area and settling in and then your first position physicist in the radiation

680
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:56,339
physics division yeah i was uh i liked i liked it the the the climate of Maryland is a little better

681
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,460
you get you get cold winners in Maryland so you get more diversity it's an Alabama it's hot most

682
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:06,980
the time even all the way around but uh Maryland it's it's she wouldn't hot in the summertime but

683
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:11,780
it's a cool sound to fall on the winter you'll get just snow and so on so we uh first year we lived

684
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:17,220
in an apartment and uh me and my wife and our kids were like that so we bought a house after i

685
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:23,780
was offered a job and bought a house and lived in the same place i think from 1980 on and uh it's

686
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:29,700
so i i kind of tried to like it as uh the Washington DC area is a culturally diverse and very

687
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:35,940
very interesting region it's civil war battlefields you know getty's bergettiedem will run all those

688
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:42,500
are you know hour so drive away from where we lived in gaitersburg and uh those are all very

689
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:47,780
interesting and well done by the national park service in terms of historical presentations like

690
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:53,700
i really enjoyed that uh we uh enjoyed the museums downtown the specific museums are just

691
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:59,619
me simply the best there is and and and that's uh that's all free and you know from where we were

692
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:06,019
30 minutes away and uh take the train down now they put a subway system in and we live close to the

693
01:08:06,019 --> 01:08:10,659
terminals of the one subway lines we could do it easily beat the end down if you wanted so

694
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:16,659
the cultural cultural things are immense and we would uh get season tickets to the

695
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:22,739
to some orchestra arrangements at the Kennedy Center and that was that was always great crowded

696
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:29,539
but great i mean it's a traffic is awful downtown Washington but uh uh it was it was a it was a

697
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:35,779
nice place to live i enjoyed the experience a great deal and uh you know there was uh the

698
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:41,539
negisites is the weather and it's also very very crowded the the roads the Washington Bellway is

699
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:51,059
it's truly awful and the road we we were uh not too far from the interstate 270 which runs out

700
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:56,420
of north of sort of northwest out of Washington and uh it's uh it's a it's a missing busy road

701
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:03,300
is all a commuter traffic back to port at DC and uh from the Maryland suburbs at the work down town and

702
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:09,860
this 14 lanes in places i mean seven lanes each way with feet or uh it just it's just awful and you

703
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:15,539
get on out of each of the bumper to bumper all those lanes and rush hour if he off rush hour it's busy

704
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:21,140
we would sometimes we would uh basically we bought a boat that we kept over on the chest speak and

705
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:27,619
even on a Saturday morning getting over to the chest speak which is anapolis uh near anapolis was uh

706
01:09:27,619 --> 01:09:31,699
should have been easy you know hour hour half drive sometimes it lasts a lot longer because

707
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:36,899
it's just traffic on Saturday morning so it's uh uh very very crowded that's one of the reasons

708
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:43,699
when uh we retired we we're not going to live in in the in the DC suburbs and uh just uh

709
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:50,099
we ended up out here instead in order but i think i was in decision we both are really glad we made

710
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:53,300
mainly the living conditions i mean the coastal activities that you know the

711
01:09:54,019 --> 01:09:59,779
and things and the DC suburbs are really superb but uh the crowdedness and the

712
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:05,300
and the and the weather are really contrary to my particular likes so some people like it of course

713
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,179
not what i like so we enjoy the weather and the environment here much better

714
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,980
well tell me about the permission of your work doing this uh oh my i was first hired at

715
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:23,860
oh my i was post-docking i'm not really post-docking but oh my i was working as a guest scientist there

716
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:30,420
the first year of our civil professor at Alabama i worked in a laboratory with a uh i named Henry

717
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:36,500
Rosenstock and and Roger Stockbauer well what very well known and in chemical physics for doing

718
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:43,220
uh in term structures of molecules they're the energetics of molecules so we worked with some techniques

719
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:51,060
using called threshold photoelectron spectroscopy studying uh a molecular process as small molecules

720
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:56,020
then at that first year also they were getting started on the synchrotron for so

721
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:01,619
and this the nymphias has a small electron synchrotron which generates light

722
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:08,099
ultraviolet light they were getting projects started using cyclotron radiation for photoelectron spectroscopy

723
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:14,579
so i joined all with uh Roger Stockbauer and a team from argon joe deamer and his team at argon

724
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:20,979
national laboratory built an electron spectrometer system that uh uh was able to

725
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:27,619
angler resolve the electrons coming off from a ionization process and atoms with many small

726
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:32,899
molecules so we built that system at first year i was there and and and then that was another

727
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:38,260
reason for me to stay a second year and then eventually take a job because that apparatus was

728
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:45,699
just coming into fruition in terms of this productivity so we were able to do some really really

729
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:50,659
really interesting things and new kinds of studies using the cyclotron radiation and this

730
01:11:50,659 --> 01:11:56,979
electron spectrometer doing angle resolved photoelectronization studies so some of the first of that

731
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:02,979
type you know in the world and it was uh it was uh very well received you know on the

732
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:09,059
in this community so we did that and then build a successively built new instruments in terms of

733
01:12:10,099 --> 01:12:16,019
for photoelectron spectroscopy and angle resolved and participated and also participated in a few

734
01:12:16,019 --> 01:12:20,899
other kinds of experiment experiments and so the laboratory experiments that i first got started

735
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:25,699
on when we went there uh we put all that all together and track those labs were closed down to make

736
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:32,260
up all the photoelectronization had to work out that was done with the cyclotron and that's

737
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:37,619
where i was hired as when they offered me a staff position was to work on the the team of scientists

738
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:45,139
working on that uh they call it surf cyclotron ultraviolet radiation facility at uh MPS and in 1980

739
01:12:45,139 --> 01:12:52,019
you're 81 they changed the name from MPS to NIST so it's sort it's the same organization but these

740
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:57,780
congresses in there infinite wisdom decided to change the name reflected a little different mission

741
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:03,060
i guess was the idea like changing organs take college organs at university that sort of thing

742
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,940
and that nothing fundamentally changed it's just after we do all the letterhead and door signs

743
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:17,140
but uh it's so i it's i i so i worked in that uh operation for about five years as a as a research

744
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:24,900
physicist in the uh in the radiation physics division and uh with the parallel to biophysics group

745
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:29,140
under working with uh under the uh guy named Robert Matten who was the in charge of the

746
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:35,060
cyclotron and uh very well known optical person the monoclonal design and so forth and so it was

747
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:42,020
it was a wonderful experience working uh with the the scientists there and the other nice nice

748
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:48,500
thing about NIST i'll call it that that's his name now is that it's in Washington DC area so you

749
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:54,740
get a continual tour touring of uh really well known scientists from throughout the world this

750
01:13:54,740 --> 01:14:00,180
is one thing i missed in in in Alabama you know you have to really work out to get the Tuscaloosa but

751
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:06,260
everybody comes through Washington DC and they would visit NIST in those days and we also collaborated

752
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,500
with a team of scientists on these photon works from from uh from England and uh John West from

753
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,300
Darisbury laboratory in England key coddling from a Reading University in England another people

754
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:24,340
in our programs and in fact i would then go to uh to England and work on on the on the

755
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,619
cyclotron facility at Darisbury and the United Kingdom and the later stages we transported over

756
01:14:29,619 --> 01:14:35,940
the instrumentation that we'd build it NIST for the flow electron sectorals we transport it

757
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:42,899
to England this was a big piece of equipment many tons and then uh transported to the Darisbury

758
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:48,899
laboratory and uh and then near up near Manchester Darisbury is a small town and then the

759
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:53,859
decided to perform and do some work over there as well with my English colleague so it was a real

760
01:14:53,859 --> 01:15:02,179
nice collaboration between the bureau standard and NIST and the and the English Darisbury laboratory

761
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:07,380
so i of course i made good friends with me so so happy this day with the

762
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:12,659
our English colleague got spent some time in in other cyclotron facilities in France and other

763
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:19,780
places as well to visit it was a very a very rewarding time scientifically and a lot of travel

764
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,780
and and interesting people and that was one of the nice things i really enjoyed about NIST was

765
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:30,500
that it was the the depth of the the people we've worked with and uh see and some of the best

766
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:38,420
people from from all over the world we had guests from France China you know in Japan all over

767
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:45,140
and to come to work in our laboratories and that was a extremely rewarding scientific time

768
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:52,020
and so i worked on those cyclotroneration experiments until the mid 1980s 85 or 86 something

769
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,819
like that then i was offered a job in another division as a group leader

770
01:15:56,979 --> 01:16:05,380
to uh there was a division that was having some personnel problems and and and they had a lot

771
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,899
of difficulties and i was asked to take over a group that was they needed some attention

772
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,859
and they called the specter radiometry group i guess it was the name of it so i became a group leader

773
01:16:15,859 --> 01:16:23,059
which is the law level management position in in NIST and i think about 1986 something like that

774
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:29,380
i don't know and uh worked on that division it was called the radiometric physics division and it

775
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:37,539
was its job was to do all the optical measurements or most of the optical measurements for this country

776
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:41,860
of standards they did everything from standard light bulbs you know when you buy light bulb the store will

777
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:47,060
have a aluminum rating on it but we maintain those standards in the standard of the candle as well

778
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:53,140
optical temperature measurements so we developed that division responsibility to maintain all

779
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:59,539
those standards as well as to develop the technology to improve the the standards and so the

780
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:05,539
we worked a lot with industry to uh in collaborative industrial partners to develop better

781
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:10,900
measurement techniques to help product quality and reliability on the assembly a lot of work with

782
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:15,619
zero-optic companies like code act 3M that the do have a lot of optical

783
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:21,139
optical measurement problems for example 3M makes a lot of white paper things like that they should

784
01:17:21,139 --> 01:17:26,019
need reflective standards and how you measure all that and and so on and i spent time with

785
01:17:26,019 --> 01:17:30,979
helping code act developed color of colored measuring processes and optical processes for

786
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:36,500
properly making a measuring film they had a lot a lot of interest in in in in those days you know

787
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:43,220
those of the film days the whole technology has changed but then on LEDs and other kinds of sources

788
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:48,020
light sources that became available we had to develop the technology to properly characterize those

789
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:51,939
and imagine because they they're a little different little different needs in your incandescent

790
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:57,939
bulbs and present bulbs and so our division uh to work with industry to develop the right

791
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:02,739
strategy to making you know reliable and consistent measurements and they came industry standards

792
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,500
how you measure an LEDs properly and so on so that's the the job of that division i've

793
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,899
initially became the division chief of that division uh i remember when that was and uh

794
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:19,619
lady jewellary nighties and and that's when i retired in 2007 was this chief of the

795
01:18:20,979 --> 01:18:25,699
changes name and then the optical technology division since i've blessed the subsequently

796
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:29,699
changes name again they've been another reorganization but it's basically the same division

797
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:35,939
it's now called sensor science division or something like that nature so i was able to then be in charge

798
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:42,819
of all these measurement techniques and uh and and develop develop uh develop work for other government

799
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:50,019
agencies and that was very rewarding i enjoyed that we had projects back in the mid 80s

800
01:18:50,019 --> 01:18:55,059
effect was one of my first jobs as a group leader in specteradiometry the defense department was

801
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:04,900
having problems characterizing very low level infrared sensors that are used for uh satellite

802
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:12,740
purposes and and uh very very the national security program and uh they had to be sensors that were

803
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:18,340
calibrated at very very low temperatures uh because they were sensors that would look at the

804
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:22,340
background of space looking at missile threat that sort of thing and so they they would operate

805
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:26,020
real temperatures and we calibrated and they make for measurement experiments to make sure they were

806
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:32,659
seen what they told you they were seen and that we developed techniques to calibrate things that

807
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:37,539
you know five degrees Kelvin just a little above absolute zero very very low temperatures and

808
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:42,739
called low background infrared calibration so it's that was a real challenge technically and uh

809
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:50,020
and that that's facility still in place being used to to characterize uh very low level background

810
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:57,460
as signals the sensor systems for primarily do the occasionally NASA and other other government

811
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:02,260
agencies have needs for characterizing very low low background sources things are going to operate

812
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:08,020
the space primarily uh it can characterize so that was a fun project and uh and develop new

813
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:12,260
technology and capabilities for the department of defense and they of course would pay for the

814
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:17,620
department of defense and pay painness for doing this work and so we really saw a lot of projects

815
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:24,500
for NOAA and NASA for the support that's where the optical did division supporting satellite

816
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:31,380
technology you see these pictures of the color pictures of the earth you see you see pictures of

817
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:38,019
the oceans where they they're using cameras from on spacecraft to measure ocean properties all

818
01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:43,220
those cameras and then devices have to be calibrated their spectroreamer system basically

819
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:48,500
flying around in space looking at the spectral content of light coming back from the earth from

820
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,460
the surface reflected and that tells you about the the properties of the vegetation in the case the

821
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:59,860
oceans the plankton and then in the in the carbon content of the ocean so we work with a

822
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:05,699
NASA developed calibration strategies to calibrate the satellites and then involves building calibration

823
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:11,300
systems for the satellites before they are launched and then trying to build systems so they can

824
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:17,860
verify their operational and flight and that tells for example the satellites looking at standard

825
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:23,539
sources in fact there's uh we have one of the big projects was to have a there's a buoy system

826
01:21:23,539 --> 01:21:30,579
out near and not lini and the Hawaiian islands that measures the light coming out of the ocean

827
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:34,579
up what they call it the upwelling radiance of the ocean so it's reflected light from the sun

828
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:38,260
going back up and that's what the spacecraft will see you see you'll see the light coming off

829
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:44,659
the ocean so that's measured out in Hawaii so the spacecraft will have a and it'll fly over

830
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:48,739
and give them a simultaneously measurement we can tell them what it is at the earth's surface or

831
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:55,460
the water surface if you will and the satellite then can check its calibration and that's been

832
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:00,659
an ongoing project in fact I'm still consulting some on that particular project we have other projects

833
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:05,300
to develop the other projects developing calibration procedures and measurement procedures the whole

834
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:10,579
range of sensor systems for the for the the no one asks the projects as well as an insurance

835
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:16,900
department another another agencies that that have a secure program so they have the

836
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:23,539
University of Physical Center systems we work with them on that as well like CIA or whatever you

837
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:29,140
know they they have a center programs and we were a government agency that would help work with

838
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:37,220
them to to develop their central measurement capabilities. Well as I listened to you describe this

839
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:40,740
said a couple things occurred I mean everyone it sounds like it was a pretty big shift when you

840
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:46,660
when you switched years to the radiation physics division or to the sorry the great spectral

841
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,980
radiometer on the field spectral radiometry group from doing sort of this more fundamental

842
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:55,220
research you're doing before to this standard. I suppose a big shift from a fundamental research

843
01:22:55,619 --> 01:23:02,420
to applied research but the underlying theme was it was all light measuring and manipulation

844
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:07,539
controlling light and sick-crung radiation using light as a source you have to build monocromers

845
01:23:07,539 --> 01:23:13,380
and build detectors of radiological radiation and so on so I'm and then in radiometry the

846
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,860
concentration is not on the use of the light but of measuring the light and characterizing you see

847
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:23,380
and characterizing the sensors so that someone else can can you know correctly determine what they

848
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,819
with their measuring and in the case the satellites what they want to know is what the

849
01:23:27,859 --> 01:23:34,900
what the the radiation is at one way compared to another and the one will have pretty accurately

850
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,300
so that those ratios those wavelengths will tell you for example the plankton concentration

851
01:23:39,859 --> 01:23:45,940
and so it's all optics of some sort or the electromagnetic radiation but it's a different

852
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:51,539
emphasis you absolutely right the radiometry division was very applied on the measurement and the

853
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:59,140
measurement technology and development of sources as well as the characterization of these things

854
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:03,699
whereas the previously the sick-crung radiation resources the fundamental driver was trying to

855
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:09,300
understand some basic features of atomic and molecular physics how molecules are and isent

856
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:15,779
associated so on. It's also the application of science to a very wide variety of projects

857
01:24:15,779 --> 01:24:20,420
some of which apparently involve some national security implications must develop a tremendous

858
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:26,899
fun area. Yeah it is and very diverse I mean and we had colleagues at our labs in Boulder there was

859
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:32,819
a whole group of divisions it was concentrated on developing techniques for measuring laser and laser

860
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:38,980
power and that was you know we collaborated with them too it was fascinating and so it was a real

861
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:43,699
learning experience and it was also a lot of fun and you know that's the highest level and

862
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:49,619
these are the best people doing this anywhere. I think our organization had you know in terms of

863
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:54,260
the national lives it was probably you know the one of the premier national labs and in the world

864
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:59,059
in terms of the quality of its research and calibration and development so it was a it looks

865
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:05,380
a really you know a really a lot of fun and it was a very rewarding and intellectually and again

866
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,300
it's the people I mean it's really the best for these were the best people in these fields

867
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:15,699
in anywhere so it was a very enjoyable time it's a job that I hope everybody can get I mean

868
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:21,300
a job in a sense that you go to work and you really love it and you you don't try to avoid

869
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,979
working with it that's fun to be there so I really feel fortunate in that regard to have

870
01:25:26,979 --> 01:25:32,179
got myself in a career where what work was really fun was financial rewarding and but it was

871
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:37,699
it was enjoyable to do and not some people I am doing you talked to there they're always

872
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:43,380
discrepanied about the working I would never say that I truly enjoyed my career in grad school at

873
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:49,699
Oregon State I enjoyed being a student I enjoyed graduate school I enjoyed being the national

874
01:25:49,699 --> 01:25:58,900
two-stage technology as well couldn't ask for any more with it yeah well what was what we

875
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:06,100
were what was your family up to while during the DC era DC years your wife and children yeah my

876
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:13,060
wife worked that she worked at several occupations she ran daycare at home for a while

877
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:18,260
but eventually she went back to school to went to hop and john hoppins and got her a master's

878
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:23,940
degree in counseling and then work in the school systems there and look I'm recanting for many years

879
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:30,340
as a middle school counselor and so on so she was able to retire from that one only lap

880
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:38,260
as a school counselor my kids went both went to college in Maryland and they enjoyed that

881
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:43,460
my fact my son is still out in in that there he lives and he said the

882
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:49,380
after college he wanted to be a cop he got on he's with the Fairfax County police

883
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:56,340
it's just across the river from Washington DC and he enjoys that a great deal my daughter is a

884
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:02,180
nurse and she lives out here in in Oregon City works for Kaiser and in an important area

885
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:09,140
well I switch gears a little bit and ask you about books and book collecting that's how we first

886
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,740
became acquainted with one another and I'm interested in knowing remember that start how do you

887
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:18,420
get into collecting collecting books I still have my books from high school I still have a lot of them

888
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:25,460
and then probably a good portion of my books from from Oregon State to some of them and so I always

889
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:30,900
just like books and I don't know I like to book some grads of school I always like to read

890
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:38,579
and then mainly when we moved to Washington and as a Maryland actually I should say in the DC suburb

891
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:44,179
I got interested in and older books rare books the friend of mine was also interested and so we

892
01:27:44,179 --> 01:27:54,739
sort of got involved in that together back in the in the in the 80s and got sort of collecting

893
01:27:55,219 --> 01:28:01,139
significant volumes back in the late 80s I think and then got interested in the history of

894
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:11,059
printing was fascinating and how how that affected our culture and my mind that's the ability to

895
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:16,659
print disseminate information really had a profound effect on our culturally vulnerable religion

896
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:24,019
but you know education and change change change change so we live and then think and then allowed

897
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:32,099
everybody if they could learn to read to have access to information and led to things like the

898
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:40,099
reformation and the real cultural changes and then not to speak of how how it's affected

899
01:28:40,099 --> 01:28:45,220
education if you think about it before the printed book getting the book was very very difficult

900
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:50,740
getting knowledge was very very definitely good lecture someone had read something but to get a

901
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:58,260
copy of a scholarly work prior to the engineering of the printing press you had to be wealthy enough to

902
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:04,180
have to hire somebody to do it by hand or to get to get to get to that so the average person even

903
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:09,300
you know professional person probably wouldn't have any volumes back prior to the printing press

904
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:13,940
but the printing press was in my mind it was a great liberating thing for for changing culture

905
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:21,699
and I just sort of interested in that got interested in the technology of printing and of course

906
01:29:21,699 --> 01:29:27,059
some of the the volumes are just beautiful and the wonderful look at and how they were and how

907
01:29:27,059 --> 01:29:32,019
they preserved the Alexander fascinating too you can buy a book that's 500 years old and

908
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:36,179
open it up and it probably looks as you know someone look as good as the day they were they were

909
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:43,619
printed like one of the books that the library has is a 5003 Seneca it's in Latin

910
01:29:44,019 --> 01:29:52,019
but it's a Seneca's works and that paper is as fresh as the day it was made there's no fox in a lot

911
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:58,099
of books the paper a lot of foxing on it's just a change in the character of the paper but

912
01:29:59,139 --> 01:30:04,579
they last forever it seems like so it's just a fascinating technology but just keeping in mind

913
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:12,979
the the profound impact it had upon on our civilization and then how we write over now now

914
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:18,739
this comparable change in the last couple decades of how this electronic environment electronic

915
01:30:18,739 --> 01:30:23,539
we delivered information is going to affect culture it remains to be seen how they've

916
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:28,179
been integration into the educational process and and in our general cultural

917
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:34,659
behavior so it'll be an interesting thing I probably won't live long enough to see the outcome

918
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:40,579
of the orbital it's a profound change how how people can get information and how you deliver

919
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:48,579
information and so things will slowly evolve as they certainly did in the late 15th century when

920
01:30:48,579 --> 01:30:53,939
the printing press became available and now how education everything changed to

921
01:30:55,619 --> 01:31:01,779
profound me tell me a bit about your methods for collecting that scouting out and purchasing and

922
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:08,260
I got a topical thing either if I could get a science thing since I'm a scientist I always

923
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:15,699
would get that if if if I something I could afford and then it primarily was in history I was

924
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:21,619
always at some interest in history and in history of printing so I have some of the volumes I have

925
01:31:21,619 --> 01:31:29,220
about purely because they were from a given printer and and and and and town like Venice or whatever

926
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:35,780
from the from maybe the 16th century that would be representative of that kind of printing that

927
01:31:36,259 --> 01:31:40,659
of that era so some of the books were that and then their Walnut scholarly works too like the

928
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:46,979
Seneca I mentioned earlier and then there's this another nice volume I give you the

929
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:53,380
Straybogeography which is a early early production of a Straybo who was a Roman Geographer's

930
01:31:54,819 --> 01:32:00,979
commentaries and maps of the ancient world that book is complete with all the diagram maps and

931
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:07,779
diagrams and so forth and so it's fascinating to Venice and both Greek and Latin and it's fascinating

932
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:14,579
just to look at that and see the the the the Romans concept of the way the world was I mean the

933
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:19,219
the master actually fairly accurate with the curvature there's totally displayed and so on and so

934
01:32:19,219 --> 01:32:26,819
forth so it tells you it just shows you just quite graphically how how you know how almost the

935
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:33,939
ancient really knew about the world and they weren't as as as ignorant as as sometimes portray

936
01:32:35,059 --> 01:32:38,979
so I I get to kick and then the some of the early scientific stuff too there's a

937
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:46,819
copy of it's in French of Ben Frank was working on electricity and that was published I don't

938
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:50,579
think was ever published in this country was published in France when he was we spent

939
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:57,220
any time in France and so a little insight into and to Ben Frank's time as a as a Franco

940
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:03,539
file I mean serving the country in France so it's in some early Newton it's just it's absolutely

941
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:08,180
fascinating I think and there's some other interesting early scientific books as well

942
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:13,779
I think they're interesting but the scholarly things are some good histories you know and

943
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:25,139
it's a good collection of Johnson the writer poet and his biography for Boswell you have a nice set

944
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:32,420
of a really nice early early productions and publications and that's here so that's a

945
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:37,300
important part of the cultural history of the English-speaking people well it's things like that

946
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:43,539
would track my interest as well as there's quite a few travel books so the early travel books people

947
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:52,420
back in the 16th 17th century no woman would find us someone to take a trip through the

948
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:58,260
orient or through the northern Africa the Levant or something and and record it record the customs

949
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:04,180
of the people and also take along either do it themselves or take along someone to do engravings

950
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:10,260
and drawings and then make these nice nice printed copies of their travels so when I run

951
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:15,140
across those if there were a good shape I would try and procure those as well because there was

952
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:23,940
an interesting insight into the culture and history and in those time frames those those kinds

953
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:28,579
of things as well I found interesting and sometimes books are just beautiful I mean they're

954
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:32,500
pretty beautiful and the bindings and good shape and you just say well I gotta have that

955
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:39,140
well I know that you've taken pride in the fact that you actually read these books too you'll

956
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,180
ask for just them and put them on the shelf yeah exactly in fact I can continue to do so even

957
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:50,579
I gave working state the majority see this right over here is a deflected in the last couple

958
01:34:50,579 --> 01:34:56,980
years was eventually you'll end up in your library but I got a for example even in the other room

959
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:03,860
I say on the stand trial often said I got a really nice Bible that one of the first complete English

960
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:09,619
Bible is printed in the United States in fact it's generally thought to be like 1796 the first

961
01:35:09,619 --> 01:35:14,659
complete Bible and I've some earlier just new Old Testament and and Old Testament's published but

962
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:20,899
this is a complete Bible called the Collins Bible I believe with the Old Testament New Testament

963
01:35:20,899 --> 01:35:26,420
all the books of the Parker are all bound and one and it's a really good shape so it's something

964
01:35:26,579 --> 01:35:35,619
I came across just recently last year so and there's a big thick book over there is PooTarks lies

965
01:35:35,619 --> 01:35:43,460
and early PooTarks lies in English so that's fun to sit down and read PooTarks was the

966
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:49,699
Roman bugger for back back and so you want to know about Julius Caesar Alexander the great

967
01:35:49,699 --> 01:35:57,380
these people that have early early early printing of a PooTar of course you'd go down people

968
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:04,659
a paperback now the same thing but here's a nice early publication of PooTarks we spent three

969
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:08,819
decades compiling this collection they made a decision at some point to donate it to your

970
01:36:08,819 --> 01:36:14,019
alma mater or be state will tell me about the thought process there well I knew neither one of my

971
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:19,139
kids is really interested in rare books per se of course they'd be interested in the value that

972
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:24,579
they're up I mean that goes without saying right I mean they have to be hindered mentally if they

973
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:29,860
didn't want that you know but if you have a collection like that and people with collections

974
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:35,300
often have this this issue as you get older so how do I you know what's going to be the ultimate

975
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:40,660
disposal of it if we my wife might both pass will pass away if these books were still sitting in

976
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:45,940
the house the children wouldn't know how to they don't particularly want them in their house

977
01:36:45,939 --> 01:36:52,099
but what would they do with them well they would call of some estate agent right and then they

978
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:57,379
would sell on somebody being here buying a five thousand dollar book for fifty cents right and

979
01:36:57,379 --> 01:37:02,899
and and so that's not too smart the other option well well I could start selling it on myself

980
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:11,779
that is truly a legal option you could do it and and you might or might not realize very much money

981
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:17,139
but the the beauty of the donation is you can have them appraised by a good appraiser and

982
01:37:18,099 --> 01:37:22,340
they stayed together as a collection in the case of that's what we were talking about in the state

983
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:26,659
so others will use them so it was very satisfying when you were and or somebody tells me how the

984
01:37:26,659 --> 01:37:32,500
students are using that was the intent so when we decided that rather than trying to sell them or

985
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:38,899
something like people give them the organ state the benefit to us is it's a tax deduction so we

986
01:37:39,619 --> 01:37:47,539
get to realize a tax deduction since it's a large sum over over over a period of time and

987
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:53,219
and and help us out financially so actually probably in the end that's probably more rewarding

988
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:58,339
financially than trying to sell them and and all that headache plus the main thing is they say

989
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:03,059
they should get as a collection for others to use and as long as I'm even I get in the car and drive

990
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:09,380
down to myself you see so I we thought it was we thought about it a while and and we finally

991
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:15,380
decided that was the part of the best strategy and then Mr. Meek came up and looked them over and

992
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:24,100
and he said that I'm arranged with your librarian Faye to accept the collection and so it's worked

993
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:29,700
out excellent and we're really satisfied because the staff of the organ state is just super in

994
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:34,979
the library and then it's been served the students there because that was a student there and I

995
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:39,859
don't think there was anything like that there when I was there and if there was I was not cognizant

996
01:38:39,859 --> 01:38:46,899
other so if we can benefit the kids of this state or whoever we think that's that's very satisfying

997
01:38:47,619 --> 01:38:54,500
and the main thing is something we spend a long time at a massing and and have a just good all

998
01:38:55,460 --> 01:39:03,460
and try and sell it it's not that's rewarding it is financially but that wouldn't mean that much to

999
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:10,579
we're comfortable with retired in another few thousand dollars when we was at this point in our life

1000
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:16,659
as I'm not going to be particularly beneficial so most of us are satisfying to do what we did and

1001
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:23,140
of course I applaud a working state immediately and part because that's where I was graduated from

1002
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:27,460
and I liked it the great deal I have very fond memories of organ state but also one of my friends

1003
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:31,220
probably got me thinking about it was so it was Derek Callahan who was

1004
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:40,180
the alumni or association the foundation for a while and he was he didn't raise the issue about

1005
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:43,940
don't he but he told me about the kind of things he did you know really helping the university

1006
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:47,300
race money and so forth and that sort of sparked my mind well maybe that's something we could do

1007
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:53,539
you know I helped the university out by so we contacted the dairy put us in contact with something

1008
01:39:53,539 --> 01:40:01,460
in the foundation and and I'll Ryan I guess Ryan Robinson at the time and working with he and the

1009
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:08,820
the library staff put me in so forth we made the arrangements so we we have found a very satisfying

1010
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:13,779
well the last thing I want to ask you about is you're continuing connection to OSU you're never

1011
01:40:13,779 --> 01:40:20,659
the library advisory council OSU is in the midst of a transition expansion right now what is

1012
01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:25,300
your sense of where OSU is at right now a very different place from the one that you went to

1013
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:30,099
it's certainly yes and I think what you what's the faith and the rest of you've done with the

1014
01:40:30,099 --> 01:40:34,979
library is just phenomenal I mean the library was not at all like that when I was a student here

1015
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:41,619
and trying to transition and take advantage of the modern electronic tools and make it space for

1016
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:48,180
for the for the students to use I'm always impressed when I go down to the places pack I was sure you

1017
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:56,500
back back in the 60s you you'd find a few people pointed over the line but that wasn't a lot so

1018
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:02,819
you've turned it into a central learning experience with space for the kids you know I think

1019
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:08,180
it's terrible important so I think this you got the transitional library to a to a really

1020
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:11,940
part of the learning environment for a large number of students it's sort of exciting it's fun to

1021
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:19,380
be a part of so my wife and I were very interested in helping out anywhere we can and of course we've

1022
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:28,260
had a lot of experience with books and and in education and conveying information so we think

1023
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:34,980
we'd be at some value well thank you very much for this I appreciate quite a lot well thank you

1024
01:41:34,979 --> 01:41:38,339
you're some good you want to help out sure
