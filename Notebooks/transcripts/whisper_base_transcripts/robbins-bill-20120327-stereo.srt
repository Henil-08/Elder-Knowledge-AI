1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
All right, so we are quite enough.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,599
If you would please go ahead and introduce yourself by the name and the date notification.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,280
Okay, I'm Bill Robbins, formally, William G. Robbins.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,960
Today is March 27th, 2012, and we're in the third floor of the Oregon State University

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,560
library, and this is an interview having to do with my longtime esteemed colleague William

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Appleman Williams.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,880
So that is what we are, principally, interested in talking about today.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,320
If you could give us a little context though, just kind of a brief thumbnail, speak to your

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
own life and your career.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:57,160
Okay, I'm Connecticut Yankee by birth, and have some residents with Bill Williams career.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,719
I spent four years in the Navy.

12
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,920
I did not however attend the Naval Academy.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,640
I was a listed man right out of high school.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,000
I went to undergraduate school after the Navy experience.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,599
I was out actually five years out of high school before I went to school.

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,559
Got a degree in a small teachers college in Connecticut.

17
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:31,799
Spent one semester at Syracuse University and then moved to Oregon in 1963, taught school

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,919
for one year, and began taking graduate seminars at the University of Oregon, and finished

19
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:44,079
a master's degree in British history at the University of Oregon in 1965, moved east

20
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,959
to the University of Maine where I had ambitions to do a PhD.

21
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,359
It didn't work out there for reasons that are not pertinent to this discussion.

22
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:03,319
And I returned to Oregon in the fall of 1966 in American history, and received a PhD in

23
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:12,079
1969 and began teaching here and there on visiting appointments and wound up at Oregon State

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
in 1971.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,200
And I was here for three or four years on visiting appointments.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,200
And one of them I know was when Bill Williams took a research leave and with the proviso

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:35,360
that I be some of the money used to be hired to hire me as another interim appointment

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
for that year.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,520
And then I got on a tenure track.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,520
So I was at Oregon State from 1971, full time till 1999, and I went half time and retired

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,320
full time in 2002.

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
So Williams came to us in 1968.

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
68.

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
For good.

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,920
It sounds like there was an interaction with him before then.

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Well, briefly, and it's a fun story, and I'm glad you asked that question.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,240
I was a graduate student.

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,439
My first discovered Bill Williams when I was at the University of Maine.

39
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:22,640
And it had directly to do with the anti-war movement having to do with Vietnam.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,719
And sometime in the fall of 1965 or spring of 1966, I started reading Williams.

41
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,600
I read Tragedy of American Diplomacy first.

42
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,599
And then I read articles that he wrote on various publications, Minority of One, and the

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,599
progressive having to do with American foreign relations and so forth.

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,599
And so when I came back to return to the University of Oregon to work on the PhD, I was fully

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,479
vested in my research project, but I was also fully vested in anti-war activities on

46
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,560
campus and in the Eugene community.

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,560
And by the fall of 1968 when Bill moved from Madison to Corvallis, I was writing my doctoral

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,120
dissertation at that point and stunned to hear that he had moved to Oregon State. I mean,

49
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,720
speechless.

50
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,319
And it had to do with a perception, mostly erroneous, that we had his graduate students

51
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,599
at the University of Oregon, that the Oregon State University was a bastion of reactionary

52
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:47,120
politics and so forth. That I learned, of course, was a far stretch when I came here and joined

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,120
the faculty. But to make this story, to bring it current, in late January of 1969, the

54
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:04,240
University of Oregon History faculty invited Bill to campus. And it was his first appearance

55
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,240
back on campus since he left. He had been there before, but giving a formal address on campus.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,480
And I think it was January 29, 1969 or January 28, 1969. And it was the onset of a huge

57
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,480
snowstorm that you can go into newspapers, you can find it, confirm it. But it was on a Friday

58
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,640
night and he spoke to a packed hall in Urb Memorial Room 105. And I was there as were

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,840
all of my graduate student colleagues who were a pretty eclectic and very bright bunch.

60
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Maybe the best group of graduate students at the U of O ever had in history, my guess.

61
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,839
Anyway, I can't remember Bill's, just what the substance of his address was. But the next

62
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:10,359
day, Mitz mounting snowfall, he spoke to graduate students in Chapman Hall, which was a place

63
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:20,879
where graduate students would gather. And I can't remember what Tickler College or Department

64
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,879
of Chapman Hall was associated with. And it was kind of a Q&A. And of course, I was enamored

65
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,360
with Bill and I was all fired up with a major question. I wanted to know what drove him

66
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,120
to become the person he did, something like that. And I'm sure I articulated my question

67
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,120
like an idiot. I will never forget his response. This is a direct quote. What the hell kind

68
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,319
of a question is that? Totally humiliated. And after I got to know Bill, I would tell

69
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,399
him that story and he said, oh, I wouldn't have said something to that. I said, you sure

70
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:19,399
don't have to. So, in other words, Bill was a historian's historian. If you read the

71
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,779
essays that Paul's working on on the unpublished essays, they're the reek with history, with

72
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:34,879
a sense of history. And my question had nothing to do with that. It had to do with political

73
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,879
activism, presentess politics and so forth. Just the opposite of the kind of person that Bill

74
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:50,439
was. Did you ever get to answer your question? No. I can't remember it. Went on from there.

75
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:58,159
And I think I started looking furtively out the window with the mounting snow. I don't

76
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,160
know how Bill ever got home. He was living in Newport at the time. And because Eugene came

77
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,560
to a standstill, I remember 43 inches of snowfall in little over 24 hours.

78
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:22,879
But it sounds like tragedy was an important thing for you, I think. Contours much greater than

79
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,879
tragedy. I used to say on my desk, I had Webster's Dictionary in Contours of American History.

80
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,320
And it influenced in a large way because I consulted it regularly in teaching United States

81
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,320
and teaching United States history. And I can't remember the details. I can say that

82
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,440
you know when I was teaching Pacific Northwest history about the Lewis and Clark expedition,

83
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,920
you know, I consult the index and find Lewis and Clark and Jefferson and so forth. And I remember

84
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:13,919
a line that I would quote to students from contours of American history. That Jefferson

85
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,360
was the great American Democrat. Jefferson was the great American Empire Builder. Right?

86
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,360
In the same Vogue. Yeah. Contours and Paul Beall-Barris Sout was a major, major book that

87
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,399
historians still have to contend with. So your experience was not isolated by any of your

88
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:53,599
ideas? No, no, I don't think so. But beyond that, when I came here and joined the faculty

89
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:02,759
in 1971 in my constant association with Bill, I began to think much more serious about

90
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:13,039
the various land. It really did direct my research in publication for many years is his

91
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:20,439
notion of political economy. The intersection between politics and economics. And here

92
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:28,719
I became interested in natural resource industries and the intersection of politics and

93
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,720
economics and something that has stayed with me ever since.

94
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,720
What sounds like you came to I see about three years after wings, but that you know much

95
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,720
about the course of or in the hiring of wings. I do and mainly from Bill. And I should have

96
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,720
brought my doctoral dissertation with me because I have to say that in the fall of 1969,

97
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I taught a US history course here on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And it was Tuesdays and Thursdays

98
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,720
when Bill was here because that was his schedule. And he read my dissertation and he wrote in his

99
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:19,720
beautiful script just some comments. And I'll try to remember to scan them and send you copies because they're

100
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,720
interesting. He took young scholars seriously. What was your question? Oh, yes. Well, the whole background

101
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
to that is failing marriage to Corinne. And I'm not sure if Paul Buell was altogether right about

102
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Bill's, Paul would argue that Bill's theme was that a woman's place was in the home. And I'm not so sure about that.

103
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,720
And I'm not sure my wife would agree with that either. But that's Paul's view. And there's enough evidence to say that's true. And

104
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Corinne's restlessness of wanting to go on and get a degree as it turns out at Portland State because they had a social

105
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,720
work program. I'm losing my train of thought, the response of the students, the students, the students, the

106
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,720
students, and the students that were going to have a ceremony to get a degree as it turns out at Portland State

107
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,720
because they had a social work program. I'm losing my train of thought, the response to your question. Right.

108
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:37,720
He had made friends with George Carson here and I think that's clear from recorded literature. And they liked each other. That was important. And George was

109
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:51,720
very bright and he was no one's fool. And he liked Bill. And then there were negotiations about the possibility of hiring

110
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Williams. And the president, at the time I think was Jensen. Yeah. And Paul Buell has it that a dean was involved because there were

111
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:15,720
questions raised about Bill's trustworthiness because he was a radical and so forth. And I remember Bill saying it was Jensen and that

112
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:26,720
president Jensen put in a call to Fred Harvey Harrington. And I don't know whether Harrington yet had become president of University

113
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Wisconsin or not. But asked him, and I remember Bill saying it was Jensen who called Harrington and asked him the Williams was trustworthy. And Bill said, Harrington said, he is. And Bill, I remember him saying, I get the job.

114
00:13:46,720 --> 00:14:03,720
That's about all I can add. And I know that there's correspondence. George Carson. And I think Tom McClinnick, Tom was sitting in. I know for George part of the time when George was on leave. So I don't know. But that should all that correspondence is here.

115
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:11,720
And you had an incentive. What is the assessment of the University? What are the part of the time you were on leave?

116
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Well, I hadn't changed much when I came here in 1971. And you know, there were there was a derth of people publishing. And that's being very kindly. But that wasn't unusual in most land-bent universities and other places either.

117
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:46,720
One of the more active people publishing at the time in colonial history was Darryl Wax. And he would when Tom McClinnick stepped down from being chair of the department, Darryl became chair of the department.

118
00:14:46,720 --> 00:15:13,720
In the late 70s, something like this. And so Darryl was chair through the rest of Bill's tenure on the faculty. But other than that, you know, I, one well-known member of the faculty was promoted to full professor on the basis of three articles published.

119
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:34,720
And I was going up for a full professor the same year in the dean at the time who died a long time ago. I tried to get me to draw my bid for promotion to full professor because I hadn't been associate professor for very long either.

120
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:59,720
But I was publishing articles and I had a book in press. And I remember it was just before the Christmas break and he asked me suggested that I would draw my candidacy. And I was a little bit offended, but I was talking to the dean. And I said that, you know, I thought that I had the credentials.

121
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:24,720
But my resume was strong enough for promotion. And I had mine this other person was going up for promotion. And I assured him that I wasn't going to jump off tall buildings or anything if I was denied. And anyway, it was turned down. And I learned subsequently that the vote among the senior review team here was close.

122
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:47,720
No, but I remember talking to the person who actually had become good friends with since who told me and he got promoted was that you just have to wait your turn, which didn't cheer my Irish sensibilities very much.

123
00:16:47,720 --> 00:17:05,720
But those were interesting times. And I was feisty, cocky in some ways, but I was publishing a lot. And my first book was published in 1982.

124
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I was going to build Red D introductory chapter. I'll never forget it before I sent it off for publication. Do you want to hear that story?

125
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I wrote it and rewrote it and revised it. And until I was sure that it was near perfect. And my wife, my family and I were living out on the Alcay highway at the time. And we drove down our long driveway. And for some reason she was driving. And I reached in our mailbox and pulled out. There it was with Williams's handwriting.

126
00:17:46,720 --> 00:18:04,720
And I opened it up as we were driving into town and pulled out the manuscript. And I told this to graduate students. Red pen. It looked like he had cut himself and bled. I'm like, perfect writing.

127
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:18,720
But, oh, did I learn about writing? Not just redundancies, but repetitive word use.

128
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:38,720
The use of that in which the proper use of that in which the proper use of these in those. And those are only I should have saved it. I don't think I have that anymore. But it was a priceless piece of editorial work.

129
00:18:38,720 --> 00:19:05,720
So it sounds like it became how I as college friends pretty quickly. We did. Yeah, it took me a while to, as I used to say, when I first came here speaking to Bill, I always felt like I had a hot potato in my mouth. But I got over that. And I would say by 1973, 1974, you know, I was sort of beyond that.

130
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:33,720
And it became friends and eventually very good friends. And I was divorced in 1972. So Bill never met my first wife. And I was single for three years. Bill and Wendy were married in fall of 72 December 72.

131
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:54,720
They went to British Columbia, I think, to Vancouver. Got married. And I didn't remarry until the summer of 1975. And this is what Paul Builness is in his biography of Bill Williams is his sense of play.

132
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It profound sense of play. Even the memos he would write to the history department, which are fun reading. Part of it is his sense of play.

133
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Sometimes very cryptic, but a beautiful sense of play. Bill and Wendy came to our wedding. And when we walked out of the church at the end of the ceremony,

134
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:32,720
tied to ornamentation on the outside of the church. We're balloons brought by Bill.

135
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Well, my next question sort of fits along in this way. I may interested in a little bit more about his personal.

136
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Yeah, well, Paul mentions this in his biography, but I don't think he struck how important it was to Bill is Tuesdays and Thursdays.

137
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:11,720
We would go down to the Krivales Hotel and the Krivales Hotel in the bottom floor that since long been gone, were two great pool tables.

138
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:24,720
And you could buy beer or beverages there. And we would shoot pool. And Bill was the best pool player.

139
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:40,720
And there would be Ben Mergeck from our department, who was kind of a crotchety cranky guy. Really a base of wonderful human being, but sometimes difficult to get along with.

140
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Even for his best friends, one was Bill and I was a good friend of Ben's too. Ben was a good pool player. Peter Kopeck, who was the founding director of the Center for Humanities, was a regular.

141
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,720
And there would be various others who would join for different times. But those were always wonderful.

142
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Get together and then Bill would catch the Greyhound back to Newport. That was part of it.

143
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Bill, it varied from politics to history to sports. And I know there was a television set. And it could have been after the Krivales Hotel closed and we moved on to somewhere else.

144
00:22:40,720 --> 00:23:00,720
I think it was. I can't remember where we played pool after that. But it was during the baseball playoffs. And when Nolan Ryan pitched for that Houston Astros, and Bill was a preeminent sports fan. And especially baseball.

145
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:15,720
And he was enamored with watching Nolan Ryan pitch. Well, he was a pain in the neck when, you know, it was his turn to shoot. And he's up watching television set watching Nolan Ryan pitch. But Paul Bill misses that part of Bill's life.

146
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:27,720
And that was a very rich part of his life too. And you probably, I'm sure this is in my brief biographical sketch of Bill and the Feshwreck, a wonderful line.

147
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:44,720
And I think it was from Lloyd Gardner, not Walter Lough Faber, that in his seminars, Bill would chide them during fall semester when the Yankees were always playing in the playoffs, or there was no playoffs then.

148
00:23:44,720 --> 00:24:02,720
He simply won the American League Championship and went to the World Series. And all of his graduate students would be anti. They'd be Yankee haters. And Bill would chide them that they just, they didn't understand power. To understand power, you have to understand the Yankees.

149
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:12,720
It was neat to see how he could take sports metaphor and switch it into a discussion of, you know, his kind of history, his approach to history.

150
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Did you take an interest in the local teams?

151
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Oh yes. He was a very close fan of Ralph Miller's great basketball teams in the late 70s and early 80s. Really. And he actually probably met Ralph on different occasions. I can't remember the details.

152
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:51,720
He knew and liked him. And he had Ralph's daughter Shannon in his class at some point. And Shannon also was a student in one of my classes as well. And she was on the woman's basketball team here and very good.

153
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Yes. Right. How would it seem to you then?

154
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Well, I've given you a flair for that already. I think his play with words, especially in memos to the history department, which I, I think I saved most of them. And you, over between my collection and whatever you gathered elsewhere, you, they're great reading.

155
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:34,720
And they're also steeped in historical metaphors. And what I always enjoyed about those is the sense of play that, you know, this was part fun, part humor and so forth.

156
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:51,720
And that you never could take yourself all that seriously. And I should have better responses to, but that was part of Bill's persona, I think, that you never take yourself all that seriously.

157
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:03,720
And I think that that's part of his differences with Arthur, Arthur Meyer, Slesinger, Jr. was that Slesinger certainly took himself very seriously.

158
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,720
And I assume this first time we've ever before itself about conversation.

159
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Oh, yes.

160
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I have to say one other thing. I told this to Paul Buil when he interviewed me when he was working on the biography that Bill was, I told him Bill is the best idea person I'd ever met.

161
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:41,720
And Paul came close to agreeing, but he had one other person in mind, the best idea person he ever met. And that's CLR James, the Caribbean Marxist revolutionary.

162
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:51,720
And one of the greatest cricketeers of all time. You might check Paul's biography of CLR James.

163
00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Where do you think this came from? Especially as exactly a brightness.

164
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Well, you know, it's to use the old metaphor thinking outside the box, no one thought outside the box like Williams. And Paul does a good job of that.

165
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:32,720
That he looked at that looked at historical questions from the side or kind of an opaque view. And he saw raised questions that no one ever raised before or thought about things in a unique and different way.

166
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:49,720
And that's what I think his work is so transformative in American foreign relations. Because, you know, old-style diplomatic history never looked at it from the approach that Bill did.

167
00:27:49,720 --> 00:28:02,720
His book, The Roots of the Modern American Empire, is kind of a classic study looking at agriculture and agriculture, American agriculture and its search for markets.

168
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:12,720
And the force that that had in the late 19th century and shaping American foreign relations certainly is a powerful way of looking at that.

169
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Yeah, the beard, in fact, the beard would be a common point of discussion over the pool table. And every once in a while, Lloyd Gardner or Walt Faeber, somebody like that would come up with something out of the beard papers, although beard burned all his papers, I think.

170
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:53,720
But it was a reference to beard that they found in somebody else's correspondence and so forth. And he would share that with me, and probably some of it maybe in what I've turned over to the archives here, the collection.

171
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:22,720
So, yeah, beard was a constant point of reference. And I, you know, of course, well aware of beard, and especially his point about the influence on the shaping of America's early period of history, and especially the making the constitutional convention.

172
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:39,720
The constitutional makers were not some of our current politicians today descended from on high, but rather they had their hand in the cookie jar. So, that was part of my understanding too of political economy.

173
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Did you ever visit the first red-backed in the court?

174
00:29:45,720 --> 00:30:06,720
No, no, I don't even know where it was. No. No, I, in fact, by the time Carl and I visited their wallpour, and I think the two of us were there together, I never visited Bill there alone, then he and Wendy were married by the time I was making trips to the coast to visit them.

175
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:34,720
What Bill did was he bought two cabins, and then when he and Wendy were married, they built a petition which housed a kitchen, a small dining room, and so forth. And then one end became a study in their bedroom and the other end was a living room.

176
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:55,720
And then eventually after we knew them several years, they built a bigger bedroom and a garage over the other end, but it was very livable and very appropriate for them. And it backed up right on a bluff over the ocean, as you probably know.

177
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:04,720
We talked earlier about the order of quite a lot of study. I wanted to be thinking of reiterating your recollections and what that strike was like.

178
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
This was not recorded though. That was over coffee.

179
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Osteer, Spartan, beautiful desk, bookcase, heartbound books, not many of them. The study was not filled with wall to wall books.

180
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:43,720
It's the neatest study I've ever seen. It's probably an expression of Bill's work.

181
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,720
You talked about this a little bit already, but how did the logistics work out of living on that building?

182
00:31:49,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Well, he had an agreement when he signed his contract that he wouldn't have to be here every day because he wanted to live on the coast.

183
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:12,720
And I wanted to teach at Tuesday, Thursday schedule. And I know there was some resentment over that. I was privy to it.

184
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:27,720
And I thought it was nonsense because it came from people who were doing nothing and had zero prestige in terms of the historical profession.

185
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:42,720
And Bill gave his all to the department. He did his share, thought his fair share of classes. He advised students and we had individual student advising, although probably not too many.

186
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Students who matriculated in his class, undergraduates, I would say probably 98% of them never knew who they were taking the class with.

187
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:09,720
And a striking example of this, I was attending a Western history meeting in Sacramento and I was in an elevator in a fellow saw my identification card for the conference.

188
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:18,720
And asked me, he said, William Mappam Williams still teaching. And I said, yes.

189
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:32,720
He said, you know, I had a class with him as an undergraduate and I never knew who he was. So that was kind of a, and I opened it for me. Well, it was something I never forgot because, you know, wow.

190
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
So he would take the bus over in the morning teaching and make it back in?

191
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Yeah, and I think it was seven o'clock return bus and he would be home. Well, by the time I was here, he was living in Walport. And so he would leave his car in Newport or Wendy would drive picking him up and something like that.

192
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,720
And so he didn't even know how that worked out.

193
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:13,720
So he didn't even know how that worked out? No, he didn't. And when he did stay over, if he stayed over Tuesday and Wednesday night, because he had other commitments and he did that pretty regularly, he stayed at the townhouse.

194
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:26,719
And it's still the townhouse, isn't it? And Southforth and it's Tommy's bar and grill. And then it was just the townhouse bar.

195
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,719
And so we talked about the townhouse hotel or the other house.

196
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:46,719
No, Crevall's hotel and I can't remember where we migrated for a while. And then the townhouse, we would get together there for drinks afterwards sometimes.

197
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,719
Can't remember. There is now.

198
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:04,719
Yeah, I'm watching. I've got about 18, 15 minutes or so.

199
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,719
How do you characterize his work style?

200
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:17,719
Well, I have to back up because by the time we were talking about writing drafts of papers and so forth.

201
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:31,719
And he would use long yellow pads. He called it full scrap. And I don't know if that it's probably, you know, a early 20th century term.

202
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:40,719
And I use the 8.5 by 11 pads now they're lined and so forth.

203
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:55,719
And he used the longer ones, 14 inch, I suspect. And he would write drafts of material on that in long hand. And then he would transfer that.

204
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:08,719
He would type it on a first rough draft after doing some editing. So by the time he was doing that it was more or less a third draft that he was typing by the time he did that.

205
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:18,719
And I know that was part of his routine. And beyond that, you know, after he had, if he was writing, let's say, empires a way of life or something.

206
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:33,719
The process of revision, you know, once he had a manuscript completed, you know, I tend to go back through chapters individually and then the whole manuscript.

207
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:45,719
But that's, of course, I'm using computers and Bill never graduated to use the use of computers. But he was a fast typist too.

208
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:53,719
And Prone, pretty ever free, I think. I mean, if you look at his typescripts, they're pretty good.

209
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:58,719
So those three days in the cost for free generally devoted to reading, writing them?

210
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:13,719
I would say yes. And some of it late night. You know, he tended to work at night. And that was a habit he developed, you know, probably when he taught at the Uvoa and certainly when he was in Madison.

211
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:28,719
Yeah, he had a house full of children, you know, two of Carrins and then he and Carrin had three children at their home.

212
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,719
And then he had some money that seems to have initially sort of presented having to do that, but maybe he came more from that.

213
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:42,719
Yeah, I don't know. I think he worked, you know, I mean, you so incredibly productive then.

214
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:50,719
In addition to turning out 42 PhDs and 11 years, you imagine that.

215
00:37:50,719 --> 00:38:04,719
Now some of them were still finishing up obviously when he was here. And I don't know when he told me at one point, you know, he had placed his last candidate.

216
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:13,719
In a job. And that could have been the mid 70s and it might have been Peggy Morley or Henry Berger.

217
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:24,719
He talked a bit about tragedy and contrary to the influential books. There's sort of a sense that his scholarship kind of declined over the time.

218
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,719
The quality during the OSU, they do comment on that.

219
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:41,719
Well, he said he would never write another book. And actually my wife and I called him on it when he published Empires A Way of Life.

220
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:48,719
And actually America confronts a revolutionary world. I think he even made that comment before that book. But he didn't call those books.

221
00:38:48,719 --> 00:39:00,719
He called them extended essays. So there was a difference. And well, then you could call tragedy of American diplomacy, you know, an extended essay.

222
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:13,719
Whether, you know, like his first book American Russian relations or roots of the modern American empire, which were detailed, annotated, documented books.

223
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:23,719
Maybe he called those books. I don't know. But I would say I was never enamored by America confronts a revolutionary world.

224
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:38,719
But Empires A Way of Life is an incredible piece of writing. And I was telling my friend, Sunday, a story who was visiting our home, that Empires A Way of Life.

225
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,719
I don't know how many different languages has been translated into you probably know.

226
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:58,719
Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, French, add in some item. And it's a testimony to the influence of his career, the body of his work.

227
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:08,719
And I think as a capsule, and my reading of Paul Biel kind of reminded me of this is how important that book is.

228
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:14,719
After reading Paul's biography, I want to go back and read Empire.

229
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:22,719
That's part of this sort of drawing, documentation of the idea of community. And seems like that was one of the world-of-finding things with the world-of-policial.

230
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:36,719
A lot of people have asked me about that and think because I was Bill's good friend for so many years that I knew more than the snippets that he published here and there about community.

231
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:49,719
But community and democracy were the small D. And pretty much everything it's in is writing. There's nothing hidden anywhere else.

232
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:57,719
It's kind of an exploration of ideas. I think that he was interested in.

233
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:05,719
That wanted what I stand for. Or I think it all has its roots in Atlantic, Iowa.

234
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:19,719
Which I stopped in there on a Sunday morning when I was traveling from east to west. I think I was back east and I was coming west and had breakfast.

235
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:31,719
And it's like a lot of other small Iowa towns. You drive in and you find a diner and you're going in a Sunday morning everyone is there for breakfast.

236
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:36,719
I don't remember much about it. Did he ever reflect on Atlantic around you?

237
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:52,719
Oh yes. Yeah. And his grandparents. And it's funny. He makes... Paul makes more of Mildred. I think then Maud, his grandmother.

238
00:41:52,719 --> 00:42:02,719
But Maud and what's his name? His grandfather, Tossi, Applement.

239
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:11,719
Porter. Porter, Inkler, Applement. They were a real presence in his life.

240
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:23,719
And Paul makes, I think, more of a psychological play on the boy who grew up without a father or something.

241
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:34,719
Porter was a pretty pronounced presence in his life. And my association with Bill, his grandparents were very important.

242
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:42,719
And he was very proud of his mother, of course.

243
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:53,719
I have one other thing I want to say about his upbringing in Atlantic. And he makes mention of 1927.

244
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:03,719
So Bill would have been six years old, maybe seven years old when Charles Lindbergh flew over Atlantic.

245
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:17,719
And supposedly yet his father's. This may be an aproctoral story. And Bill remembers seeing the plane in the dipping of the wing and so forth.

246
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:24,719
I've always wondered about that. When Bill was a good storyteller, very good storyteller.

247
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:30,719
I wonder if this is something fashionable that he remembers from his childhood and so forth.

248
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:39,719
And I tend to have those same, it's probably romantic notions myself about my own childhood.

249
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,719
I think we have a graphic actually where it's not that it's not the minute.

250
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:49,719
Is that right? Well, then it's not an aproctoral story. Yeah.

251
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,719
I'm interested to know more about his teaching style.

252
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,719
It was eclectic,

253
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,719
socratic.

254
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,719
He wanted to engage students in dialogue.

255
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:12,719
And I would say it probably worked greatly for sophisticated, for older students.

256
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,719
And not sophisticated, but with inquiring minds.

257
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:21,719
And I know because I tried it myself.

258
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:27,719
And it worked one term, then I tried it with a larger class.

259
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:35,719
And I had to give it up and went back to lecturing.

260
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:40,719
And I would have a lecture format, a framework of discussion in mind.

261
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,719
But I don't know Bill,

262
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,719
you know, he was a master at that.

263
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:55,719
And I think that he would lecture from a general outline.

264
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,719
He would just have three pieces of paper with notes in his beautiful penmanship.

265
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,719
And what they were profound.

266
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:11,719
When I was away at a conference one time, he met with a night class that I taught.

267
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:18,719
And he left me with, it was a colonial history class.

268
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,719
And it was very early fall term.

269
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,719
And he left me with a copy of the notes.

270
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,719
And they're in my papers in your collection.

271
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:34,719
And they were, I mean, it was unbelievable.

272
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:42,719
The world view of what the coming of Europeans to the American continent did.

273
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:50,719
And I used to do it in more immediate ways.

274
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:57,719
Bill's, however, was framed into how you impose on the people new languages,

275
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:04,719
new frames of reference, new world views, and so forth.

276
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,719
And I'd have to go back and look at it.

277
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:16,719
But I even put that in one of my books, incited his, it's very profound.

278
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:26,719
So you came to us to a university about a graduate program this week.

279
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,719
Do you have a sense of frustration in the middle of the road, how do you know that?

280
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,719
No, no, despite what Paul Bill said, I think.

281
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:42,719
One of the reasons for coming here was to get away from training graduate students

282
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,719
because he had enough of training graduate students.

283
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:54,719
And he wanted to settle in a place where he didn't have to shovel snow in the winter.

284
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,719
And he wanted to be close to the ocean.

285
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,719
People have asked me about this.

286
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,719
You know, at conferences, when they first learned that I taught at Oregon State in Bill Williams,

287
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,719
I was like, why does he want to come there?

288
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:09,719
And I would repeat these three reasons.

289
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,719
And I have never heard, never heard him say anything other than that.

290
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:17,719
He told that to interviewers.

291
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:29,719
He would tell it to Carla and me when he'd had a couple of bourbons and he never said anything else.

292
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:35,719
How about the quality of the student's talent and the institution and the undergradity of students?

293
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:41,719
Well, I think there was some sense of frustration with that, obviously.

294
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:47,719
But he would be very proud of some of the papers his students did.

295
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,719
Here, I know that from time to time.

296
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,719
My impression is that he was a fairly demanding student who expected a lot of his students.

297
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,719
Yeah, I'm not sure that he was all that rigorous, a greater.

298
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:10,719
I can't, you know, I was less interested in those kinds of things.

299
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,719
You mentioned that they would do a lot of advice.

300
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:20,719
Well, it's hard to say.

301
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:24,719
He did have, you know, we all shared advising.

302
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,719
And usually they were students from our own classes.

303
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:35,719
And so we would have advisees assigned that way.

304
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:38,719
I had huge classes.

305
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,719
I know in the 70s I was teaching Indian history.

306
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:49,719
And I was, in fact, in retrospect, overburdened with students.

307
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:56,719
I had to use different kinds of roosters to go through grading exams and so forth.

308
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:02,719
I'm interested in my as time to move on.

309
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,719
What sort of role would he assume within the department?

310
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,719
He's never a chair of the department.

311
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,719
You mentioned a Sunday's this initially, and it's hired.

312
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:14,719
Right.

313
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,719
Do that resistance disappear?

314
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:19,719
Do you become kind of a mentor to the Symbagina faculty?

315
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:25,719
Well, I know some of the resentment early on when I was hired.

316
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:39,719
I was a very jealous accusation that Williams was turning to develop a department full of radical young people and so forth.

317
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:54,719
And part of it was focused on me and part of it was focused on a young French historian that the department hired to teach African history and French history.

318
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,719
This fellow was very bright.

319
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,719
He was very flawed and he never got tenure.

320
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:11,719
I think by the time this fellow was denied tenure and that was, let's say, by 76 or so.

321
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,719
He was gone.

322
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,719
That had fallen by the wayside.

323
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,719
But that was very prevalent at first.

324
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:23,719
I need to go up one right here.

325
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:42,719
One of the best pieces I thought of that appeared in Northwest newspapers and I don't know the exact date was a piece that Foster Church published in the Sunday Oregonian and had to be about 1983, 84, something like that.

326
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:50,719
I don't know what the exact was, but I know I clipped a copy of that and I don't know whether I'm sure you have it.

327
00:50:50,719 --> 00:51:04,719
The best part of that I think is the photograph of Bill on the back deck of his home looking south along the coast.

328
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,719
It's a great photograph. It's on the back of Paul's book too.

329
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:16,719
So I'm just continuing on. Is there anything more to talk about in terms of the role that you assume is in the department of Rick.

330
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:30,719
No, except the overweaning jealousy thing that I've mentioned just before we took the break was something that bothered me.

331
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:49,719
Part of it I think had to do with those of us who are really interested in building a department in which people published, taught, engaged in the professional meetings, gave papers, and so forth.

332
00:51:49,719 --> 00:52:06,719
And those who didn't and I think that some of that went away by the time of Bill's retirement 1985, but there were still sharp divisions in the department.

333
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:27,719
And between what kind of was the quasi progressive Williams faction and those opposed and it was pretty pronounced and it lasted until I served one year as department chair.

334
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:36,719
And I did nothing brilliant, but there were four people in the department who came to me and I was an interim appointment.

335
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:48,719
At different times during the first, right after I was named acting chair, an expressed, you know, real concern about the direction of the department.

336
00:52:48,719 --> 00:53:16,719
And what I told them was that, you know, I was a Democrat with a lowercase D and that I had no intention of making end runs around people or pushing any special direction in the department, any ideological agendas.

337
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:35,719
And by that time, however, the department was changing a lot. There was a cadre of people who had published books. You had to have a book to get tenure and so forth. And by the time I was through with my year, three of those four people came to me and told me what a good job I was doing.

338
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:44,719
And I wasn't doing anything brilliant except, you know, we were a different department than and those kinds of factions went away.

339
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:59,719
But that was part of, you know, the hangover from Bill's presence here. You know, he was president of the organization of American historians for help in 1981.

340
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:07,719
How about his presence within the university without something to burst star or celebrity?

341
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:20,719
Oh, yes. I mean, people knew who he was and presidents knew who he was. He actually got on well with John Byrne. And you should interview John.

342
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:42,719
Yeah. You know, because Bill assumed with good reason that he could speak to John Byrne as an equal. And there weren't many faculty. I don't think who presumed that they would speak to the president of the university as an equal. And Bill did.

343
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:57,719
And Bill also played a great role and you'd have to look into the records of the center for the humanities and getting the center on major endowment.

344
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:09,719
And it became part of the university, not the foundation. What's the development? OSU foundation.

345
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:23,719
They had four major objectives in a push and one was the center for the humanities. And Bill was a major player in that. And obviously because of his prestige, his stature and the profession.

346
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:35,719
And he lent his voice to that. And I'm sure that the center, an I know Peter Copack, was always very thankful to Bill for that.

347
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:43,719
Was that was the center something that the leader that is sort of a bit of a pride in the choir?

348
00:55:43,719 --> 00:56:04,719
No, it was Peter's idea. Williams was enlisted. Yeah, Bill was not a player. It began as the humanities development office over in Morland Hall. And it kind of morphed beyond there. And then when it became a full blown center for the humanities.

349
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:17,719
That's when Bill was brought in as a good friend of Peter's along with a few other people. And he was a major force in how that worked out.

350
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:29,719
We talked about the social setting of the pool table. If larger and the professional gatherings perhaps this would be this sort of person who enjoyed hanging in the room or the meeting?

351
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,719
No, no.

352
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:37,719
So you talked a little bit more about how you sort of operated in that situation?

353
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:43,719
No, department meetings? No, it might get a professional gathering of sorts.

354
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:57,719
No, I, he was, I'm people like to talk to him. And I've only been around him at professional meetings when he was with his former graduate students who were, they were friends.

355
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:09,719
They were former graduate students. It was Lloyd Gardner and Walter LaFabre, Ed Craypole and others. They were just dear friends. He liked them. They liked him.

356
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:24,719
And when they came here to give talks, Bill would introduce Lloyd or Walter Favour as someone he knew when he first started teaching at the University of Wisconsin.

357
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:32,719
And he said, you know, it's like your students are smarter than you are or something. You know, he paid them great compliments.

358
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:46,719
And I, I just remember my first social occasion, Carlo was with me. It was when Bill, the organization American Historians was meeting in San Francisco.

359
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:59,719
And we were at the Hyatt Regency down on the waterfront. And it was late in the afternoon, cocktail hour, and kind of a rotating bar at the top.

360
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:10,719
You sat and you'd see the San Francisco or the Bay Area, skyline all around. And, and Carlo and I were there with Walter LaFabre, Lloyd Gardner.

361
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:21,719
I don't think Ed Craypole was there. I don't remember Jerry McCauley being there, but a couple of other people from the organization American Historians.

362
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:37,719
And, you know, it was a fun gathering in Lloyd Gardner. Lloyd Gardner was probably the most garrulous of the group. And because Lloyd had, you always had a glint in his eye about some devilish story.

363
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:47,719
And he was a better storyteller in some ways than Bill. You know, and Bill was just part of the crowd.

364
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:52,719
Which dimension is President of the organization that point to his very proud of that was?

365
00:58:52,719 --> 00:59:03,719
Yes, he was. It was recognition long deferred. As Paul Biel says, Eugene Genevase had been president three years prior to Bill.

366
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:22,719
And, you know, it's, it's, it's funny. People who have controversial or quasi radical positions, you know, become presidents of major organizations long after the fact.

367
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:32,719
One of them, I just learned in my own field of Western American history, Donald Worcester is the forthcoming president of the Western History Association.

368
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:48,719
And he's retiring. And Don, in a lot of our views, should have been president, you know, in the early 1980s when he was publishing, you know, good books. He's published good books ever since then.

369
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:58,719
But he's been a person who's been a bit edgy, like maybe not as much as Williams, but he's finally going to be president.

370
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,719
And he knew Bill spent time in his house.

371
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,719
And this was not about graphic feelings. You had a head that you used to find to add?

372
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:12,719
Yes, he did. And he worked very hard in his year as president.

373
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:22,719
And started, I think, something that Gertel Lerner, who finished, who followed Bill as president, gave him a lot of credit for his initiatives.

374
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:30,719
Although, they didn't bear fruit, you know, especially with the national endowment for humanities. He got nowhere.

375
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:43,719
He appealed to several historians who made thousands of dollars writing textbooks. And he had ten or fifteen of them in mind.

376
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:56,719
And he wanted each one of them to donate a thousand dollars to create this. And he put five grand in himself to do this and to no avail.

377
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:06,719
A lot of the lines is sort of a bit further to honor his. We mentioned the college. Also, I would only see one on our adopted business.

378
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:08,719
Yeah.

379
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:18,719
Yeah. I'm Paul makes mention of that. My answer is so what?

380
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:33,719
Did he ever get the honor? No. When he did get the honorary doctorate at Columbia College or something in Chicago, his address had to do with Duke Wellington.

381
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:43,719
I remember that. I remember reading the talk. He would give Carl and I copies of his talks.

382
01:01:44,719 --> 01:02:07,719
Oh, yes. Love jazz. Yeah. Miles Davis. Pretty close. Dizzy Gillespie. Who's the one I just mentioned? No. Duke Wellington. Yeah. Yeah. They were kind of classic jazz.

383
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:28,719
And I know when we would go to the coast, he invariably have Miles Davis on his stereo. He fished the ocean. I went fishing with him once. We didn't catch anything.

384
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:38,719
We went down in the rocks and yahats. And we stopped and I said, I had to stop in a store when I was coming through Wallport to get some bait.

385
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:49,719
And then I drove up to Bill's place and then we drove south the yahats. Yeah. He liked to fish. He loved. We have some of his photography in our house.

386
01:02:49,719 --> 01:03:07,719
And his photography goes back to evidently his childhood. And we have a, I don't think you have a copy. But here I doubt. Of a photograph that he took when he was a student in a napless. And it is striking.

387
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:26,719
I mean, it's so damn creative. He climbed up on a trancem over one of the major public buildings at the Naval Academy. And on a Sunday in the sunlight is shining through the door.

388
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:44,719
And people who walk through when they're approaching, they cast shadows. And there was a woman evidently approaching the door. And he captured her shadow from a pie over the trancem.

389
01:03:44,719 --> 01:04:02,719
And we have it framed in our house. And it's a, what do you call it? Maybe a marble in laid floor or something black and white. And it's a black and white photograph. And I imagine it may be black and white in real life.

390
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:23,719
And then he would take close ups of items along the coast, like a rusty hinge somewhere real close to the water. And, or, gnarly wood that had been weathered and so forth. And we have several of those. Those were wedding gifts.

391
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:40,719
And he had photographic exhibits too. I know Paul mentions when the new bridge was being built in Walport across the LC. That's the only photographic exhibit that I know he did. He may have done others.

392
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:57,719
But that was one of his, uh, applications. And Paul mentions that he went back to building model airplanes again is later after he retired.

393
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:14,719
Do you have any of those here? No, the photographs or the model airplane. What happened to them? Ward is some ward may have them. He'd be a good person to interview.

394
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:43,719
There's several references in the bar. And, uh, no, that's well known. And, uh, I don't think Wendy liked that in the biography. She didn't like the references to womanizing. And, uh, I know this, she was visiting us.

395
01:05:44,719 --> 01:06:04,719
And, uh, I was staying with us actually. And, when we lived in Fulhamon, and, uh, the only, my only response to Wendy was that I had been with Bill in thick and thin when he was drunk sober or he never was really drunk.

396
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:19,719
And, uh, I was in between. And, he never, ever said anything negative about Wendy. I had to tell her that. And, I remember I had tears in my eyes. I said, Wendy, you have to know this.

397
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:35,719
And, he also could recover, uh, dramatically. And, I know that on the eve of his introduction of, uh, can't remember the guy who the president-elect introduces the president.

398
01:06:35,719 --> 01:07:04,719
It's a very prominent historian. And, I can't think of his name right at the moment. In 1981, when we were at the Hyatt Regency, Carla and I sat in a lounge with Bill that afternoon. And, Bill had, he might have had a drink or two before. And, then he had another one with us. And, boy, he was, like, I said, hey, Bill, you know, you, you have to introduce Sonsow at eight o'clock for his presidential address.

399
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:20,719
And, he said, okay. So, he goes to his room and he naps. And, we saw him at the dinner, I think. And, it was like, you know, he never had a drink.

400
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:33,719
I'm really interested in this paper column. Oh, they were great. Yeah, I loved them. I saved a lot of them, but I'm sure I missed several. I used to clip them and put them in a file.

401
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:41,719
It seems like such an unusual, thanks for a story to you on such a regular basis. Yeah.

402
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:56,719
But, the specs of these papers are unusual for these papers. Yes. Yes. It started with the Statesman Journal because he knew one of the executives in the Statesman Journal,

403
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:09,719
and I can't remember whom. And, they liked Ed Bassett. And, they liked each other. And, so that's how it started. And, he got so, and he used to tell me about this.

404
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:22,719
The number, the word limits, you know, and how you take an idea and develop, you know, an essay and you get it down to, I don't know what is 700 words or something like this, whatever the column is.

405
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:32,719
And, you know, he became very good at it. And, then, I don't know, is a changing command at the Statesman.

406
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:44,720
I think he started with a Statesman, then, the Statesman Journal, they merged the two papers dead. And, then, he migrated to the Oregonian. And, he did that, the Oregonian for a while.

407
01:08:44,720 --> 01:09:01,720
And, I think that probably happened in part through David Sarason, who was in his early period with the Oregonian. And, then, they killed a piece that he wrote.

408
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:14,720
And, they paid him, you know, the kill fee. Never again. That was it. That was it. You know.

409
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,720
Well, it's a real testament. I mean, he took that as an affront. Yeah.

410
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:27,720
So, the column that I think is a real testament to, and that idea that he had to share, and then, sort of, meeting with him.

411
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,720
And, they're very eclectic.

412
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Yeah.

413
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:46,720
I talked about a lot of this. I guess I'm interested in knowing more about clients, when you, sort of, recollections of visits to all of work?

414
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Our collective visits to all of work. We always had a lot of fun. And, invariably, we would go out to dinner, occasionally with friends.

415
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:08,720
Or, we'd go down there, they'd have friends over, and the people I remember best were a couple named Barbara and Rob Davidson.

416
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:15,720
And, they were a lot of fun. Rob was quite a bit older than Barbara, and he passed on, eventually.

417
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:25,720
And, I've seen Barbara just a couple of years ago, and she's since remarried, and she was a very good friend of Wendy's.

418
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:35,720
But, Bill liked both of them, and he liked Barbara, and I know him immensely. And, they were fun people.

419
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:42,720
Occasionally, they would have people from the OSU community over, just a handful.

420
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:52,720
One of them was a fellow who retired in engineering, David Bella.

421
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,720
Yeah.

422
01:10:53,720 --> 01:11:02,720
Now, you might want to interview him. David's kind of a kind of class in his own righties.

423
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,720
He'll talk to you in your ear off.

424
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:12,720
That's where David was a really young professor. Bill thought, I know, a lot of him.

425
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:20,720
He liked people who had good ideas, and so forth, and he prided himself on that.

426
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:30,720
David was over there one time, and I can't remember anyone from the department, or a fellow named Jim Cole, who was here, is a visiting professor.

427
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Jim was a good friend of Bill's, but Jim was kind of crazy.

428
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,720
By me, Bill would say that, and Jim would admit that himself.

429
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:47,720
And, he was undisciplined. Bill Meakim.

430
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,720
He's the fellow who didn't get tenure, who came from Wisconsin.

431
01:11:51,720 --> 01:12:02,720
It was actually a Harvey Goldberg student, and a radical guy.

432
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Bill had all kinds of problems. It was booze, and primarily booze.

433
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:16,720
I think he couldn't finish his dissertation, but he couldn't get anything published.

434
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,720
That was his own failing. I mean, it wasn't.

435
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,720
I was good friends with Bill Meakim too.

436
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,720
So the guy who's really better at conversation?

437
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Yeah, or just snack, food, drinks, and talking about music, and just for a couple of hours.

438
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,720
Bill and Wendy did.

439
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,720
Yeah.

440
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,720
I think we were going to have a bridge.

441
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:52,720
Carl and I never played bridge.

442
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,720
We were probably from people from the valley.

443
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:01,720
We were probably over there more often than anyone else.

444
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,720
And on special occasions, Wendy's birthday.

445
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,720
We'd go to New York Hots for dinner.

446
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:13,720
One time we went over, I think, during the Christmas New Year's holiday.

447
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,720
And Carl and I stayed. Our kids were getting a little bit older then.

448
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:22,720
So we left them in a motel.

449
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,720
And went into YAHOT's for dinner with Bill and Wendy.

450
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,720
And then we would call them every hour to make sure they were.

451
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,720
The kids were okay.

452
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,720
By then they were at seven, eight years older.

453
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,720
A couple of more than that one.

454
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:48,720
Well, she was her own person.

455
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,720
And very, very bright.

456
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,720
And very hardworking.

457
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,720
She loved to garden.

458
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,720
Bill built her a little greenhouse.

459
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Plastic.

460
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:12,720
She used to do pots and so forth.

461
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,720
And she also played the piano.

462
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,720
And she worked in a gift shop up in Newport that's still operating.

463
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,720
And I can't remember the name.

464
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:29,720
If my wife were here, she would remember.

465
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,720
Yeah, she was a very hardworking woman.

466
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:38,720
Very bright. Very political.

467
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:47,720
And I think that's where their friendship, certainly, materialized because of Bill's politics.

468
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:55,720
And Wendy, a Brit who came to Corvallas via British Columbia,

469
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:02,720
was kind of keen on somebody who had politics that she appreciated.

470
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,720
So his fellowship was something that they would discuss?

471
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,720
I'm sure.

472
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,720
And she read voraciously.

473
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,720
I don't think she ever edited anything at Bill Road.

474
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:24,720
When he made public talks, he might just have her read it just to try it out.

475
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:31,720
And there was something that he'd gone astray on.

476
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,720
Carlin Wendy were very good friends.

477
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:40,720
And we remain good friends to this day.

478
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,720
So we talked about his love and the city a little bit.

479
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,720
I don't know if there's any more to share there.

480
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,720
I'm interested to him that the Maritime is a big class city development.

481
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,720
The two were one.

482
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,720
Just to give you a quick answer.

483
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:03,720
The Maritime History class actually originated, I think, in part, through the Center for Humanities.

484
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,720
I know there were various of us.

485
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,720
I wrote a course that I taught on community through the Center for Humanities.

486
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,720
Bill did the Maritime course and there were some others.

487
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,720
And I think I can't remember the details.

488
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:24,720
But we got some stipend or something for doing that wasn't much.

489
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:39,720
And that was kind of an application for Bill, you know, touring off and part of his affection for the sea and Maritime History and so forth to do something like that.

490
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:49,720
And you got interested, of course, in the Chinese early Navy and the famous Southern was the 11th or 12th century.

491
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:54,720
Famous Chinese who I saw his name in Paul's book the other day.

492
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,720
I can't remember his last name.

493
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,720
I had gone out on the high seas and came back and scuttled the Navy.

494
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:08,720
And Bill used that, you know, as a metaphor for no empire, which I love.

495
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:14,720
And he wrote a paper having to do with something to that effect.

496
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:30,720
And he was going to read it at the Pacific Coast Branch meeting of the American Historical Association in Honolulu in 1996.

497
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:37,720
And I was there presenting a paper on another panel and Bill something happened to him and he couldn't make the trip.

498
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:42,720
I'm not in 1996, 86.

499
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:49,720
And it could have been another meeting of the PCV. It was about that time, late.

500
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,720
It was 86 or 87, 88, maybe somewhere else.

501
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:57,720
But anyway, he couldn't make the trip and I read his paper.

502
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:03,720
And I had a lot of fun doing it because there were a couple of people on the panel.

503
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:09,720
They commented was a person whose area of expertise was Chinese history.

504
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:16,720
And there are bills venturing in this paper talking about Chinese commander and so forth.

505
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:22,720
And I had to add a bit of humor to it and I told them why Bill couldn't be there.

506
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:32,720
And I said, I refused to defend this paper because I know nothing about the subject or something like that.

507
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,720
Anyway, but it was received very well, including the commentary.

508
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:50,720
And somebody else made very nice compliments to the paper because no one else in American history was thinking in these venues,

509
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,720
unless they were specialists in Chinese history or anything.

510
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,720
And Bill had the guts to venture out.

511
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,720
It's interesting to me that he taught this class at a community college.

512
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,720
Yeah. He taught it here too.

513
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,720
And then he taught it at the Coast Security College for a while.

514
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,720
I don't know how successful that was.

515
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,720
Well, of course it's helped the client with his diet.

516
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:27,720
I don't know, to what extent, did he reflect on that as any boss or an M.A.C. who might have to share it?

517
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:38,720
Well, you know, I know he, the week before he died, the cancer massacized.

518
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:44,720
And he kind of had a stroke because he came walking down the hallway.

519
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,720
He was gesturing to Wendy. He couldn't speak or anything.

520
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,720
And within five days, I think he was dead.

521
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:59,720
And then I went over and saw him in the hospital.

522
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:06,720
David Cleaver, who's a famous physician in Kervalis, was a good friend of Bill's.

523
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,720
And David was there when we were there.

524
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,720
And he explained, you know, he said he's semi-combatos or something.

525
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,720
His eyes could open a little bit, but he wasn't corresponding or anything.

526
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,720
He was under morphine then.

527
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,720
And he was on the way out.

528
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,720
Wendy, of course, had worked in hospitals a lot of her life.

529
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:35,720
And you know, she knew that the end was near.

530
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:42,720
I felt bad. I told Wendy, you know, because I was busy with my own work.

531
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,720
And, you know, I enjoyed going over to talk to Bill.

532
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:52,720
And I would just drive over and have coffee with him or something like that.

533
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,720
And I felt badly because I hadn't been over for a month.

534
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,720
And she put my soul to rest.

535
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,720
You know, she said, that's neither here nor there.

536
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,720
What was the local reaction of the Heles in the moralized?

537
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,720
Well, this is something I learned.

538
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:18,720
And I learned this from Ed Craypole.

539
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:24,720
I always thought that Bill and Wendy went to the Episcopal Church because of Wendy's influence.

540
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:29,720
And I was totally wrong.

541
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:33,720
That was Bill's choice to go to the Episcopal Church.

542
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:41,720
And he was, I don't know whether he helped with, you know, the sacraments or something.

543
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:46,720
I don't know. But Wendy went just to accompany him.

544
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,720
Wendy was there. And is a radical quaker.

545
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Her sister, her husband Allen, her Wendy's brother, while Allen.

546
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:01,720
They're in the truest radical quaker tradition in England.

547
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,720
And it was Bill, Ed Craypole told me this.

548
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,720
So I said, you mean Bill is high church, not Wendy?

549
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,720
And he said, yes.

550
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,720
So Ed Craypole is the guy you should talk to about that.

551
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,720
That was striking to me.

552
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:34,720
And I think, and I was reading between the lines and what Paul said, that his kind of sense for order and maybe hierarchy or something later in his life attracted him to the Episcopal Church.

553
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:41,720
And I don't know what his church bringing wasn't Episcopalian. I don't think in Atlantic.

554
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:48,720
But I do remember that.

555
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,720
Well, is there anything else that we should touch on?

556
01:22:52,720 --> 01:23:03,720
No, I have, I have one final thing. And Bill's passing is something akin to my mother's passing.

557
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:08,720
And she was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 60.

558
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:14,720
And right after she had retired from as a factory worker.

559
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:22,720
And I had obviously an immediate period of grieving.

560
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:30,720
But when I went back east for going through a wake, my father was Catholic.

561
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,720
My mother wasn't, but my father wasn't a practicing Catholic.

562
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:38,720
But he just thought, you know, there's people who die need wake.

563
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,720
So we had this damn wake.

564
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:45,720
And I met my mother's friends from the factory.

565
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,720
We came in by the droves.

566
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,720
And I never shed a tear.

567
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,720
And it was nice to meet all these people.

568
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:03,720
And Bill's passing is somewhat like my mother's because my mother has a living presence in my life.

569
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,720
Bill has a living presence in my life.

570
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,720
I mean, I remember him as the conversations happened yesterday.

571
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:15,720
And that's healthy.

572
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,720
Thank you, Jerry.

573
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,720
You're welcome.
