00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is Maya Fishler and I'm at the home of Jean Starker Roth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today is October 31st, 2007 and Jean and I are going to be talking about the years

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when she was raising a family here in Corvallis, her life with Kermit and that section of her life.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And you did a great job in your interview with Wade telling about how you met Kermit.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I don't want to make you repeat that story but it is a wonderful story about how you two came together.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But I'd like to know a little bit more.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The questions that he didn't ask you are the kinds of questions that a woman has a tendency more to ask in terms of what it was about him that attracted you.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How you knew he was the right man for you at the very early days there.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, I had been dating a lot of boys out at the not only at Campa Deir but also in Park in Astoria at the US.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I know and officers clubs up there and I don't know when I met Kermit we just hit it off and the first date that we had after the original date at the fraternity house.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We just talked and talked and talked and everything was just you know we agreed on a lot of things.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He was an easy person to spend time with.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right. And so I think that that and of course he was tall and he was good looking.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Lots of people said that he looked just like Gary Cooper.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In fact when I obtained his picture to put in my apartment in Astoria when I had people come they'd say why do you have Gary Cooper's picture in your room?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wow that's quite a statement.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And also after we were married sometimes we go to a gas station and the gas station boys would come up and then after they put the gas in several times this happened.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They would knock on my door and they'd say did anybody ever tell you your husband looks like Gary.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well that's quite a compliment.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you dated for about a year before you got married?

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We met in September because that was State Fair and PI which was Pacific International.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That was a big thing with extension.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then Thanksgiving he planted his paternity pin and at Christmas we announced our engagement and we were married in June.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's a pretty quick turnaround so it was September that you met him.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You must have been pretty sure then that he was the right man.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes that's right. There was never any doubt in my mind.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well some of the things that you did together and that was for six months that helped to secure your relationship.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well I think that we spent a lot of time with our families and I think that was very educational because from then on from the time we met he would come to Astoria and I had an apartment in a big old house.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do I want to say?

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was a very old old house and the people that I lived with had two little girls and I think they wanted me to live there because I could occasionally babysit if they wanted to go to a late movie they knew I was home.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I could watch the girls but we stopped.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I lost my dream.

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You spent a time with your family.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes well he would come up and they offered for him to stay in their bedroom.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A bedroom adjoining my unit.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then the next weekend we would go to his mother's house and we would meet there.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then the next weekend we would come down to Carvalis and he was at the fraternity and I was with my parents.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I see.

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In those days you didn't live together no more you married.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Absolutely not.

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we were at one of those three places every weekend from that time on.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your parents got to know him pretty quickly.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes. How did they like him?

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They thought he was fine.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They liked him from the start.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Never really discussed it but I remember very distinctly saying now if you have any I'm going to marry this man if you got any objections tell me now.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm like you had gotten pretty bold over the years.

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You've come a long way from those early days.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So he was still going to school at that time.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes because he had started school and do you want me to tell you a little bit about his background?

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Absolutely.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, Kermit was raised in Monmouth because his father was supergative schools there.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I guess that Carvalis played Monmouth in football and he played football but I didn't know him then.

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then his father wanted to get his doctorate degree.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So Kermit joined the 3C.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, he went to school I think one term.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then his dad didn't have enough money to go and get a doctorate.

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So Kermit joined the 3C's and he sent his money home from that so his dad could get his doctorate.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then...

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That was right after high school?

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then his father did get his doctorate but it was during the war by then.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And he was asked to go to Portland to teach welders how to not only weld, no that's wrong.

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He was asked to teach welders how to teach welders because a lot of them knew how to weld but they couldn't teach people how to weld.

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So he was employed to do that to teach.

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then Kermit went into service and his father died while he was overseas.

67
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So the Red Cross flew him home.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I didn't know him at this point in life.

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And then his mother had always taught at school and she moved to Canby and bought a house and it was a four or five bedroom house.

70
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And she took in teachers because she was so lonely.

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And that developed when we were married and then she died when we had to get a house.

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We had to buy a house that fit our furniture because she had all these beds and mattresses.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, did she inherit it?

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We inherited all her furniture.

76
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You could have started a rooming house yourself.

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But the bedding and all of that was so good to give away.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So we tried to keep it.

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And of course eventually we used it with all our cans.

81
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's a good thing.

82
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So where was Kermit in the war?

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He was on Tinian, which is a little island about a mile by a mile and a half.

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Very close to...

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, I'll have to think about that.

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll have to get you the name of that.

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But you know it.

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you heard it, it was very much in the news.

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it was a small island.

90
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But there were japs on it.

91
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And they never knew when they were going to run into somebody who was hiding in that island.

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But that was when he learned to scuba dive.

93
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because he was a mechanic repairing airplanes that had been shot down.

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And so he took the plexiglass and made a mask.

95
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And took the rubber off the tires and it had blown.

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And made the back of the mask.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And he made quite a little money during that period because he would dive for shells.

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I don't know how many shoe boxes of shells when we were married.

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He brought those with him.

100
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So he took advantage of being in a tropical location?

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, he did.

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And he always blessed the government for sending him to a warm climate because he said that he never would have survived in Europe with a cold.

103
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He did like to be cold.

104
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So he was with the Air Force.

105
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But he didn't fly. He was always in mechanic.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, he intended to fly.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But by the time he got through his schooling, they didn't need pilots anymore.

108
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And he had a course of very handy man and he knew how to fix anything.

109
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So they put him in a good job for him.

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But he did have to do some combat?

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, not really. It was never a shooting person.

112
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He just worked on the airplanes.

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But when they walked around the island, they were exposed to jacks sometimes.

114
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I know he said that he'd dug some holes to hide in if they were around.

115
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But he wasn't in a situation where he was particularly traumatized when he came back.

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He was in pretty good shape.

117
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, he was in pretty good shape.

118
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But he told me that when he came back and of course he lost his dad.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so his mother wanted a lot of things done around the house.

120
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And he said he didn't go out at all. He just wanted to stay home.

121
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So he did a lot of repair work around the house that she wanted done for.

122
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think it was over six months that he just didn't do anything.

123
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, he needed to make a transition.

124
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes. And then when he came back to school,

125
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he was ready to get on with his life.

126
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And his goal when he came back to school was to get a Tomlinson commission.

127
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it must be a thing of the past because I asked some military men not long ago

128
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
if they knew what a Tomlinson commission was and they didn't know anything about it.

129
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But as I understood it at the time, it was a commission given to people with proper qualifications.

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That would give them a permanent place in the military,

131
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
not a reserve commission which most of the kids who go through ROTC receive.

132
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So that was quite an honor to get that.

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then we were going to be married in June.

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And he received the Tomlinson commission just in very short time, maybe made, maybe the middle of May.

135
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Before we were to be married and he said, he never consulted me, but he just said,

136
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I just figured you wouldn't make a very good military wife and I turned it down.

137
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's interesting. Now, why do you think he thought that was it the moving around part that he thought she was looking for?

138
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think so. And I also think that he blamed it on me a little bit.

139
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But I think at the time he decided to get married that he wanted to be settled down, he didn't want to travel.

140
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So I think it was a little bit of both.

141
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's a hard life really definitely.

142
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So what was his major in college?

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Industrial engineering.

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, interesting. I didn't realize that.

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And he worked for a high-ster company the first year or so.

146
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We moved after we went on our honeymoon.

147
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, I don't know whether I covered this with weight or not, but we were, he was commissioned in the morning.

148
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And he got the Thomson commission at noon. He was graduated from Oregon State and it was 107 degrees in Carvelle.

149
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
At that time they graduated from the men's gym, which is now something else, I don't know.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And they had ice, big 50-pound box of ice in all the windows.

151
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I remember looking at his car, he had perspired clear through all his car.

152
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then we were married in the evening.

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh my goodness. That was a big day.

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was. Had you planned it that way? Did you know that the graduation was going to be a thing?

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, that sounds like a stressful way to do things.

156
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:38,000
After the honeymoon, why we, and that was also a little crisis because we had the van port flood at that moment.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Tell me what that is.

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And so we were going to, up to quit late Quenald.

159
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We had to get up to Washington.

160
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so, Kermit said, well, we were going to spend the first night in Salem.

161
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because we didn't want to drive very far.

162
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And after the wedding and all the day we had.

163
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And there was a thunderstorm that night because of the heat.

164
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And when we drove up the highway, there were power lines coming down and flopping on the highway.

165
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I thought, oh, we're going to get electrocuted before we ever have a honeymoon.

166
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But we did. We made it to Salem. Then we knew that the bridges in part, and we're all closed.

167
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So the only way to get north was through Longview or bridge of the gods.

168
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And so he said, which do you want to do? And I said, well, we're off on a holiday.

169
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's just go to the bridge of the gods. I've never been across the bridge of the gods.

170
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And he said, okay, so we went up there. And we came around and we got as far as.

171
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Some place in Washington. I can't remember the name.

172
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Good river is close to the river.

173
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
K, it was something K.

174
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can look on a map and find it. But anyway, we got that far.

175
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the town was underwater.

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So then we had to turn around, go back over the bridge of the gods down to Longview and then across.

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wow. And we called that what flood, the Vanport flood?

178
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Vanport flood. And that was a big major.

179
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It was where a lot of people lived during the war. It was kind of low income housing.

180
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And it all flooded near Portland.

181
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You've never heard of that, Vanport?

182
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I am embarrassed to say that it happened.

183
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's very well known, like a lot of people.

184
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So, was it section of Portland?

185
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes. It was out by Jensen Beach.

186
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll look that up and read about it a little bit.

187
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So anyway, you were going to tell me a little bit about your wedding.

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, yes.

189
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Was the material in turn in there?

190
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sure, that's correct.

191
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And at first I said to my parents that I don't want to be married in the Presbyterian Church

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because at that time it's been remodeled since it was pretty barney.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And cold I felt.

194
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I just didn't want to be married there.

195
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, we got to looking at the wedding list.

196
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And of course, Kermit's family was from Madmouth.

197
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And my family had lived here forever.

198
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And the guest list was getting so big that that was about the only place that we could have the wedding.

199
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So blessed my father, he decided that he could fix it.

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So that morning he and I don't know who else.

201
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I wasn't aware of it all going on.

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But somebody helped him and they brought in about 50 fertries.

203
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There were a lot of them.

204
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And they put it all around the front of the church.

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And they were out there.

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And it was so hot that they, and it was in June when the new growth was on the fertries.

207
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And so they wilted and it looked like a little ornament on each limb of the trees.

208
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was just beautiful.

209
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And so it was on the inside of the church?

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes, they brought them all in and put them up inside the church.

211
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And as I say, all the fertries, because it was so hot, they just wilted.

212
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And all those little new growth on it, just hung down.

213
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And they looked like a little ornament.

214
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was just really quite effective.

215
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And then we had white, one of those white flowers that you take to San Matarys in June from a Memorial Day.

216
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Not for Santhoms, but not down.

217
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know either, but I can look it up.

218
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll let you do that.

219
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Pretend we were able to think of it before we get through.

220
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But anyway, it was really pretty all white and then the shades of green.

221
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, yeah.

222
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was really quite lovely.

223
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And people were quite impressed by it.

224
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes, and so perfect for your family.

225
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes, it was.

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's a nice statement.

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So tell me about your dress.

228
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Is it something that...

229
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, I made my dress.

230
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You know, in those days, there were the bridal stores that there are now.

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I wanted to wear my mother's wedding dress, but it was too small.

232
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My mother was a very petite lady when she was married.

233
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But she had a lot of lace on her dress and also on the veil.

234
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So I took the lace and put some sheer yoke on my dress.

235
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And the lace was from her wedding dress.

236
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So it was quite a sentimental affair.

237
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I made it because I was a home economist and I sewed.

238
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And there were patterns and sewing books to use.

239
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It worked out just fine.

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And then her veil had been kind of eaten through the airs with different, I suppose, balls or something.

241
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know.

242
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And anyway, I used all the lace from her veil around the edge of my veil.

243
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I thought that was quite nice.

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, it sounds very touching.

245
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Was it a large group?

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Was it your family or were there friends and community members too?

247
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, there weren't too many because there was my father's sister and her husband.

248
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And then my grandmother was...

249
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
My father's mother was alive at that time.

250
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And her wish was that she lived to see me married.

251
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And she got her wish.

252
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She came in a wheelchair.

253
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And she couldn't see very well.

254
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But we had a nice conversation.

255
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And during our honeymoon, she died.

256
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And so we had to come home from our honeymoon to go to her funeral.

257
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And I was like, wow, wonderful that she got her wish.

258
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

259
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So there's so much planning and such that goes into weddings these days.

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems like it's just a huge endeavor.

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Did you have a big build up to it?

262
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, no.

263
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think in those days it wasn't a three day affair like it is now.

264
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So we just...

265
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, as I say, we were pretty busy all day.

266
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But we just had the wedding and then reception.

267
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And people didn't stay long at that reception.

268
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It was too hot.

269
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But we had cake.

270
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think we just had cake and punch.

271
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There at the church.

272
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That sounds just right because then you could get out and get on your way.

273
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

274
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So now they do a breakfast after the wedding and all that stuff.

275
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Dinner beforehand.

276
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, yeah.

277
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
My daughter went to a wedding not so long ago.

278
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It was in Hawaii.

279
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They had a big groom's dinner.

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, my folks did a groom's dinner the night before.

281
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And we had a lot of the fraternity boys.

282
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And some of the family, but there were only just those few people.

283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't think my grandmother came to that because she was too frail.

284
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But we did have...

285
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And they gave it because her mother was in...

286
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
She lived in Canvy.

287
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it wasn't convenient for her to do it.

288
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And those days we didn't go to restaurants.

289
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It was all done in your home.

290
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Sure.

291
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've got more of a family event.

292
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, you know we only had just one or two restaurants in Carvalas.

293
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Customs in and out.

294
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The Gables, that was about it.

295
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The Gables was an original.

296
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Interesting.

297
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Have any of your...

298
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Did either of your daughters use your dress as a wedding dress?

299
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No.

300
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No.

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They never did.

302
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They wanted their own.

303
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you still have that dress?

304
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes, I do.

305
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I hope you'll have a picture of you and your dress.

306
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It won't fit now.

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't mean a curve picture.

308
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But I do have a picture.

309
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Good.

310
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Wonderful.

311
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So you went off and did your honeymoon and then he ended up in a first job in Portland.

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And how did he get that job with Heister?

313
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, I think through the college in those days we had placement people.

314
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I know I was placed in a job by a placement person on the campus.

315
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I presume that's how he got his job and he worked for Heister for...

316
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We lived there.

317
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We lived in an apartment, a very small apartment, for a few months.

318
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Her mother wanted to do three things before she died.

319
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I'll try to remember what they were.

320
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
She wanted to go down to see her other son Norman, who lived in California.

321
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
She wanted to fly in an airplane.

322
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What was the third thing she wanted to do?

323
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, she did all three anyway, whatever they were.

324
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It may come to you too.

325
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And so she said, why don't you and Kermit live in my house while I go do these things?

326
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because she spent probably a month, maybe more down in California.

327
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And she had a garden.

328
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
She was a great gardener.

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Of course, can be soil is wonderful for gardens.

330
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And so we stayed at the house and took care of the garden.

331
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I did a lot of canning for her and got things, you know, made use of what was in the garden.

332
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then she came home.

333
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And I had an offer, I think maybe I told Wade this, I had an offer to go down to the dowels.

334
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And do a...

335
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Sometimes I have trouble with getting the right words out.

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I was judging a fair.

337
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So I said to her, wouldn't you like to go with me?

338
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That'd be a nice trip for you.

339
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I'm just going for the day.

340
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And she said, oh, she'd love to.

341
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, she went with me.

342
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I judged pillow slips among them.

343
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And broader pillow slips among many other things.

344
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And I gave first prize to the white embroidered pillow slips.

345
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because a lot of the women had done multi-colored ones.

346
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And they were pretty bad.

347
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Excuse me.

348
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Hello? Yes?

349
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes, Rebecca, how are you this morning?

350
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

351
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I have a lady sitting here now that's doing an interview with me.

352
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So I really can't talk.

353
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, good.

354
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, now when are you in a week from Friday?

355
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay.

356
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, would you put a little tickler on your counter to call me when you get home so that we can...

357
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I can come down and talk with you.

358
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

359
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Thanks.

360
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, we had a good time, didn't we?

361
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I did.

362
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay.

363
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Bye.

364
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Bye.

365
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Sorry.

366
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's kind of right.

367
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Can you give the prize to the white pillow slips?

368
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes.

369
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So anyway, there was quite some discussion, apparently, about this judge who was doing this.

370
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And she sat in the corner and listened to her new daughter-in-law being criticized.

371
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
She could hardly wait to get in the car and tell me that he's women, that's it.

372
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And she was just laughing and she just thought that was the funniest thing.

373
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They could get that excited about their real-of-lips.

374
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
She had quite a sense of humor and she used it often.

375
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
She just had a great sense of humor.

376
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We got along just great.

377
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, it's a shame that you didn't get to spend more time with her.

378
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yes, I would.

379
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then I suppose we better put in something about how she died because it wasn't more than a couple of months.

380
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'd forgotten when she died, but she didn't last more than a couple of months after she came home.

381
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And we got a call when we were in Portland.

382
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We had moved from the house where we lived while she was away.

383
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And we got in our department in Portland.

384
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We lived where the Safeway is now in Lloyd Center.

385
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And we got a call one morning about 530 or 6.

386
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And the landlady's, you know, telephones were hard to get right after the war.

387
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And she had no telephone in her house.

388
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And we had no telephone in our house in our apartment.

389
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But the landlady called and she tapped on our door and she said,

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
your mother has had a heart attack and you need to go.

391
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And so we just dressed and left.

392
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And we got there.

393
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
She had the heart attack and gotten up and tried to make it over to the neighbors,

394
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but had fallen in her garden.

395
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And the neighbors had found her early in the morning, fortunately.

396
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And so they got her back into the house and in bed.

397
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And of course we got there and called the doctor.

398
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And you know what we know about heart now is just like night and day.

399
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Because we didn't know the minutes where seconds were important at that time.

400
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And the doctors at that era made house calls.

401
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So the doctor came to the house and of course by that time, you know,

402
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
she was, had quite a lot of problems.

403
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, she lasted about two or three days.

404
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I remember, Kermit went back to her apartment to clean out the refrigerator

405
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and get things squared away because we just left and bring some clothes for us to wear.

406
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And so when, well, he was gone to Portland to get those things taken care of.

407
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
She had another attack.

408
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And I was feeding her some apple sauce because I had made some from her own apples.

409
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And she said, oh, it smells so good.

410
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I just would like to have a taste.

411
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And so I said, well, fine, I'll fix you some.

412
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And I was feeding her.

413
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And all of a sudden she just, just died.

414
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And so when Kermit came home about the time that that happened.

415
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And he immediately called the doctor and he said, well, she's gone.

416
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Sorry.

417
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Sorry.

418
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Hello.

419
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Hi there.

420
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
How are you?

421
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Good.

422
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But I'm with a lady here that I need to, she's doing an interview with me.

423
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I don't have much time to talk, unfortunately.

424
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Where are you now?

425
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay.

426
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, I'll call you tonight.

427
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I mailed the package to Micah today about the coat.

428
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, so he'll get it in a couple of days.

429
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Good.

430
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Good.

431
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, I said I took all the things off of the batches.

432
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And then I sent it to the cleaners.

433
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So it's all ready to go.

434
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
All right.

435
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, I'll try and call you around five o'clock work.

436
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

437
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll give you a call.

438
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay.

439
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That was my grandson.

441
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Quite all right.

442
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So you were saying that Kermit got there just as she asked away.

443
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yes.

444
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I didn't know anything about death.

445
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And he held her tongue down.

446
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And it was pretty awful.

447
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So then we had to call his brother in California.

448
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And he came up and then we divided all the stuff.

449
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And that's how we got all the furniture.

450
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Because they didn't want the furniture.

451
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
They'd been married for a number of years.

452
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And he was the oldest brother.

453
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And Kermit was the youngest.

454
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So they said, you just take all the furniture.

455
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So that's what we did.

456
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So do you think you said she had some of you wishes of things she wanted to do before you died?

457
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you think she had a sense that she was?

458
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think she knew that.

459
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I really think that Kermit sensed that he was not going to live very long.

460
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Really?

461
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because he was so, always so insistent that I know everything about our business.

462
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And so, and both his parents had died of heart attack.

463
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Of heart attack.

464
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

465
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
His father fell off of, he was milking a cow and fell off the stool and died.

466
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So, you know, he had bad genes.

467
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, that's true.

468
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That means a lot.

469
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Huh.

470
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But she was a delightful person while you knew her.

471
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And did Kermit have that same fun sense of humor as she had?

472
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't think it was quite as broad as her sense of humor.

473
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But she got a big kick out of life.

474
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So, it was nice to know her briefly.

475
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah.

476
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So, there you were in the big city of Portland.

477
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Was it a pretty happening town at the time?

478
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, yes.

479
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I think that I really enjoyed Portland.

480
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I didn't want to move back to Kermit Palace when we finally made that decision.

481
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But Kermit thought it was the thing to do.

482
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We had two children by then.

483
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And he thought it was the thing to do.

484
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And my dad was putting a lot of pressure on him to come back and start a plywood plant.

485
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh, interesting.

486
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And of course, Kermit had the industrial engineering training.

487
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So, there were ten men who put their money together and built the plywood plant.

488
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And Kermit designed it and was in charge of it because the rest of the men all had other jobs.

489
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So, he did that for three or four years.

490
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't remember just how long.

491
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But then the plywood market went kaput.

492
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And so, they sold it to somebody.

493
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I can't remember.

494
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So then he went into partnership with a man, Gordon Larson.

495
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And that's, you know, Beverly Larson, who runs the O'Mill School.

496
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, it was her father that was in partnership with Kermit.

497
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And my dad was sort of putting up the money for this mill.

498
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Gordon had had a mill out, well, at the Y in Pholomath, he was on the wall porch side.

499
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't know.

500
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It wasn't very far up that road.

501
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He had always had a sawmill.

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But they decided they built it down here at 53rd and reservoir road.

503
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And so, Kermit designed that mill.

504
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And then they built it and ran it for, I would say maybe eight or nine years.

505
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And then they had a, I wouldn't say a, well, they disagreed on just a little bit about how it should be run.

506
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And so Kermit said he'd like to buy him out.

507
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Gordon didn't have the money to buy him out.

508
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So Kermit did buy the mill out.

509
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And then Gordon died probably maybe six months after that.

510
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That was all settled.

511
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because of course they had to divide up all the timberland and everything.

512
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, I see.

513
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
They had property.

514
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They went with the mill.

515
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
They bought a lot of timberland in order to have timber in the wintertime when they couldn't log other places.

516
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They bought timberland that could be logged in the wintertime.

517
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So that was very fortunate that we got all that done before he died.

518
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, that would have been a mess.

519
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I think I'd have a hard attack too as I remember it.

520
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You could check with them about that, but I think that he did.

521
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So that mill is not there anymore, is it?

522
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, it isn't.

523
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's where they started to run sheep.

524
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I know there's a little organic meat there.

525
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They couldn't do it because it was annexed.

526
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh.

527
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I ran the property for a number of years after my husband died.

528
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I rented it out to various people who ran the mill.

529
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then timber prices weren't very good.

530
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And the last people that owned it, it was just ready to not be run anymore.

531
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And so one day they were putting in the water pipe down reservoir road

532
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and then it came into the fairgrounds.

533
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And they wanted some place to dump the dirt.

534
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And so I said, well, dump it in the pond because I just assumed fill in those ponds.

535
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, it seemed as though that was not the thing to do because there are rules about filling ponds I found out.

536
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, one day I spent, I don't know how long on the telephone.

537
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It was all one afternoon and into the next day talking to governmental agencies.

538
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And finally, I got a hold of some, I don't remember which one.

539
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But they said, oh, Mrs. Roth, we don't talk to owners.

540
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We just talk to lawyers.

541
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And that was the living end.

542
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I just decided I wasn't going to have anything to do with that.

543
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So my, I was mopping to my son about it.

544
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And he said, oh, mom, you shouldn't have that stress.

545
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I said, I'll take over running it.

546
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So anyway, he tried to run it for, I don't know, four or five years.

547
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And he was in California and it was just too much.

548
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So he finally sold it.

549
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And that's when they started to run the goats.

550
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And then they found out they couldn't run the goats because it was in it.

551
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He had annexed it.

552
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And so now it's...

553
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's in the city limits.

554
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, it's in the city limits.

555
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That's interesting.

556
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And it's very odd because soon after can got through, sold it.

557
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Now, they're, you know, they put in all that lovely area in front of the fairgrounds

558
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and they've got the dirt over ready and they're going to run the street.

559
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They're going to go up over the railroad and they're going to do that right away.

560
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

561
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's interesting.

562
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So bad at the city.

563
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You know one thing after another.

564
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So he, so current was, as long as we're talking about his career,

565
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I can ask you the rest of my questions about, about his career.

566
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So he then stayed at that mill till, I know it was.

567
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He wanted himself in 67 then.

568
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And then did he stay with the mill?

569
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
All the rest of his life?

570
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes.

571
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yes, he shut it down after he'd run it 12 years.

572
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And we didn't do anything with it.

573
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I guess he...

574
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I can't remember whether he rented it to anybody or not.

575
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But he played the stock market and he was very sharp about it.

576
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He would get up in the morning and look at all the listings in the paper.

577
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And he made a lot of money on the stock market because he just had a feel for it.

578
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And one time we bought Fuji Photo Stock.

579
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And we made a lot of money on that because it was just when it was starting to come into the United States.

580
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So he said, I think we should take a trip.

581
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I said, well, we made our money on Fuji Photo.

582
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I think we should go to Japan.

583
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And so we did.

584
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And that was real fun.

585
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We had a lovely, lovely trip.

586
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So was that when you had all four children?

587
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Did you take children with you on the trip?

588
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yes, we did.

589
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Wow.

590
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, I guess we can skip to that.

591
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I want to get back to a couple more questions about his progression through his career too.

592
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But I'd love to hear about the Japan trip since we're there.

593
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, we got a lady to stay with...

594
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
In the meantime, my mother had passed away.

595
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And we got a lady to stay with the children.

596
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But she had to also feed my father because after my mother died,

597
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the course that day, I said, will stay for dinner.

598
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And he just kept coming.

599
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
He kept coming.

600
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That lasted 15 years.

601
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
He had a regular dinner invitation.

602
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, he didn't have an invitation, but he came.

603
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And he didn't leave at the table.

604
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And at first, he lived just through the woods between Jackson and Van Buren.

605
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But then later, he moved out on to Timmion edition out on 53rd Street.

606
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then by that time, Kim was learning to drive.

607
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And so she'd go out and get him and bring him in because he wasn't driving by that time.

608
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So he just always came.

609
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's a nice thing.

610
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's good.

611
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So you had a woman who stayed in the house and...

612
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And she had to feed him too.

613
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So care of things there.

614
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then the rest of you packed off to Asia.

615
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes, we did.

616
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It was a very extravagant trip at that time.

617
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, it was.

618
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, we've stopped over in Fiji going.

619
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And then we had a couple of days there.

620
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And then we went to Japan.

621
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then on the way back, we stopped at Porobora.

622
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Wow.

623
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
How long was the trip all together?

624
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I think we were gone three weeks.

625
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That was a pretty long trip.

626
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yes.

627
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And that was your first time out of the country, right?

628
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
We've been to Hawaii a couple of times.

629
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So you've done some flying.

630
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes, because we took all the family to Hawaii a couple of times.

631
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So was it...

632
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Was Kermit more of a traveler since he'd done his stint there during the war?

633
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He really enjoyed the trip to Japan.

634
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
He just thought he didn't have any desire to go to Europe at all.

635
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think he'd heard too many tales during the war of hardships in Europe with the military.

636
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But he really...

637
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't know why, but he just thought the Japan was great.

638
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Interesting.

639
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And...

640
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What's...

641
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
What's over?

642
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So having been in the Second World War and over in that part of the World War,

643
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
was it hard for him to embrace the Japanese?

644
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Did he feel any prejudice against them?

645
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
No, it didn't seem to be.

646
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
He didn't seem to have any feelings about the Japanese.

647
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And we were there during...

648
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What do they call that?

649
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
When you have the world?

650
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It was...

651
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Not the world's fair.

652
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
World's fair.

653
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's what it was.

654
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And of course, we were so tall that the Japanese...

655
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We'd hold our hands out like this and the Japanese would get under our arms and then they wanted their pictures taken.

656
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Because we were so tall.

657
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

658
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
What an experience for your children to be able to see that.

659
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Well, they showed...

660
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We showed them the pictures, of course, when we got home, but they didn't go...

661
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So the children didn't go home?

662
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No, no, no, no.

663
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay, okay.

664
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
No, he...

665
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The babysitter stayed and took care of them and...

666
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
They took care of everybody.

667
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I see.

668
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They did.

669
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I hope it's that all together.

670
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah.

671
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, I want to ask you some more about some of the other travels, too, but...

672
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So we don't get too off course here.

673
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm going to take us back to where we were when you were talking.

674
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I just wanted to finish up learning a little bit about Kermit's career, because you've been talking about that.

675
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And what I wondered was when it was that he started getting involved in property management,

676
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
how we move from being an industrial engineer to...

677
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes.

678
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
...through the lumber business and then into...

679
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's quite a transition there.

680
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes, it was.

681
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Well, I told you that my mother had died there, and I had inherited the by-mark property through the...

682
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
My mother's part when she died.

683
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And so my dad had given me that property in exchange for some property that he had.

684
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And that's a 10-21 real estate exchange.

685
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And that's how that came about.

686
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I did that.

687
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That's probably he's more known for that in the United States than for his forestry.

688
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Are you familiar with that?

689
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Well, when I first started looking, researching your family a little bit before I started, I looked and I did find that...

690
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
...that many references on the internet to TJ Starker have to do with that real estate judgment.

691
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yes, that was decided and then has been sort of the standard then from then on.

692
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes.

693
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And so we inherited that and then we bought several...

694
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
When he was working with the stock market, we bought several pieces of property.

695
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And in turn did some 10-31 exchanges with that and we always traded up.

696
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And so we just...

697
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You know, that was our income.

698
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Because we didn't have anything.

699
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
We had to have some flow.

700
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But when Kermit died, there was not much property that was giving me any real secure monthly money flow.

701
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And so that's when I started doing the real estate thing.

702
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Because I traded some of the timber land that was left over from the mill.

703
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I traded that for real estate.

704
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
More usable.

705
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And that I would really like to have some emphasis put on that because when my father died, he left me having.

706
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
In fact, in his well it says to my daughter Jean, I leave nothing.

707
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:03,000
His whole point in establishing his timber was to create a starker forest.

708
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
What would you say?

709
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Like a Thea or a...

710
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yes.

711
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And he didn't want it broken up.

712
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So he didn't.

713
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And everybody thinks I got some money from him and that's how I got started.

714
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But that's not the way it was.

715
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He wanted all that to be kept within the structure of the business.

716
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That's right.

717
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Interesting.

718
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And you know, I could be bitter.

719
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But it's...

720
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I don't know what I did with that piece of paper.

721
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I have two things that I think I'd like to put in this because that's what I lived by.

722
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I wrote that out.

723
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Well, all of a sudden I go out to the kitchen before you leave and see.

724
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Because I wrote those sayings down.

725
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
One is something about...

726
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's worded better than I can worded, but it's something about if you have an acid in a container,

727
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
it sometimes eats it the container that it's in.

728
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And there's another one about there.

729
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And I think that's very true.

730
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I could be really bitter.

731
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I could be very upset with my nephews.

732
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They had nothing to do with it.

733
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It was all my dad's object to leave that as a unit.

734
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And he didn't really appreciate women either.

735
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
He didn't like the fact that women were in the forestry school.

736
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And he didn't really like my sister-in-law got interested in the timber business.

737
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And he really didn't like that either.

738
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
He was a German.

739
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah.

740
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
The oldest son.

741
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah, that's a long-standing tradition of patriarchy.

742
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah, that's right.

743
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Well, you did very well.

744
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I probably by...

745
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
German's hard work in the stock market and buying things at the right time and that kind of thing.

746
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And does the Roth property services business still exist?

747
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, yes.

748
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That's what I do.

749
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Three times a week I work at that.

750
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I have a bookkeeper that comes and keeps track of things.

751
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And I manage the properties.

752
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And I have four major properties that I'm leaving to.

753
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And I have one to each one of my children.

754
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So how did you learn how to do all that real estate business?

755
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I don't know.

756
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I think it was by Osmosis from hearing my dad speak about it.

757
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I think I just absorbed the way it was supposed to be done.

758
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
His talk at the dinner table was always about business.

759
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I think I must have just sort of absorbed it.

760
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Did you increment work together in the early years when you were...

761
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Absolutely.

762
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah, absolutely.

763
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I remember one time we owned up that property down the corner of...

764
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's where that painting pottery painting place is.

765
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Downtown.

766
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And we owned that building at one time.

767
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And the real estate man, I remember this so vividly,

768
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
he called up and he said, did we want to sell it?

769
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And Kermit put down the phone and he said, do we want to sell that?

770
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Because there was a lot of agitation at the time that they were going to change downtown.

771
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And the Madison Avenue Task Force was in starting and they were going to do big things.

772
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And of course the guy that's chairman of the Madison Avenue Task Force is a very good friend of ours and still friend.

773
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But I didn't always agree with what they were doing.

774
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And so I said to Kermit, you know,

775
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I think we're going to be charged a lot for doing makeover there.

776
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And I said, what do they want to give us for it?

777
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And so the realtor said, well, what do you take for it?

778
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And we don't, we don't held it a year or so.

779
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And I said, well, 50,000 more than we want to pay for it.

780
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And he said, my buyers will take it.

781
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So, 10 minute conversation.

782
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I thought that that was a pretty good way to make 50,000 bucks.

783
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, so you, the two of you were sort of a business team.

784
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes, we'd always kind of saw eye to eye on how we did it.

785
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So forth, we never had any discussions.

786
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
We just talk about it.

787
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That was it.

788
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Go on from there.

789
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So did he ever regret leaving me off being an industrial engineer?

790
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
No, I don't think so.

791
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,000
No, I think it was very much, I think he really enjoyed the business aspect of it.

792
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
He thinks so.

793
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Sounds like he was a natural at that.

794
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

795
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

796
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So you had your first two children there in Portland?

797
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yes.

798
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And then we moved down here.

799
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And we had a house down on 10th and Adams.

800
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Right by the railroad.

801
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Pacific through.

802
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Sure.

803
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I don't know where that is.

804
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, about word.

805
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yes, yes.

806
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, where it was right there.

807
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Where we had our, we bought the house because it had enough bedrooms for us to put the furniture.

808
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then my dad was developing Cedarhurst, which is the corner of 35th and Harrison.

809
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And he had, I think it's 32 acres in there.

810
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And he developed that with a division of Badbeer and Jackson.

811
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And he gave us a hunk of property down on Jackson Street because he'd given my brother a piece of that area between Badbeer and Jackson.

812
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But clear at the end of where the dairy barns were.

813
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And of course they lived at the last house out on Harrison.

814
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
They built that when I was in high school.

815
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So that's where we lived.

816
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So after we moved back to Curvellis, why he gave Curvell and I this piece at the end of Jackson.

817
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And Curvellis just took a year off and built that house.

818
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And he built it with the help of one carpenter.

819
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I think he only subcontracted.

820
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
He did the wiring.

821
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So he subcontracted the heating and the water.

822
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Seems to me there was something else.

823
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
He did all the rest of it himself because he was capable of doing that.

824
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And I backed primed all that siding.

825
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I would go out there after the children got up from their naps in the afternoon.

826
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And I'd go out and they'd play in the yard.

827
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I was painting.

828
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we did it together but it mostly curmed.

829
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
That's impressive.

830
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Is that house still standing?

831
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yes. The Kines lived there.

832
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yes, in fact it was written up in the paper recently.

833
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes.

834
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I remember seeing your name in that article.

835
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And how long did you live in that house then?

836
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
We lived there 35 years.

837
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So all the way through your childhood memory?

838
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yes, and he died from that house.

839
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And I lived there six years after he died.

840
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
But you know it was a seven bedroom house.

841
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And it was a little big for one lady.

842
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And so when my last one married, I knew she wanted to be married from that house.

843
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
She's a very sentimental girl.

844
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And so as soon as she was married then I thought,

845
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
boy, it's time to take care of Jean.

846
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I then built this house.

847
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I see.

848
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I built this house.

849
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But Kathy in the meantime had gotten an architectural degree.

850
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And so she designed the house pretty much for me.

851
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then built her.

852
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Wow, wonderful.

853
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So I really supervised all the building of this house.

854
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you like building?

855
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes, I do.

856
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then later I built the house at Newport.

857
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So I built two houses.

858
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That's impressive.

859
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I helped my husband and I built our house.

860
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And I always think I would never do that again.

861
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But some people really enjoy it.

862
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh, I did.

863
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I just thoroughly enjoyed it.

864
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah.

865
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So many decisions to make.

866
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, yeah.

867
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But I loved it.

868
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I thought it was great.

869
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Wonderful.

870
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Good.

871
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So I'm trying to envision your life here in Corvallis with four children all pretty close to the same ages.

872
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Well, they were actually ten years apart because the first three were two years apart.

873
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And we waited four years and then had the next one.

874
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But still you had your hands full.

875
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yes, yes, I did.

876
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I was busy with the children.

877
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Had you stopped working before you had children?

878
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes, I did.

879
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But I did a lot of not only volunteering, but I did some teaching at the high school with what do they call that?

880
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Well, it's where you teach certain courses to adults.

881
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I don't know what they call that now.

882
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
They used to be night school.

883
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, something like that.

884
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But now it does have a note in the name you're right.

885
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah, and I don't know what that is.

886
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But I taught Pendleton Jackets were very popular.

887
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And so I taught a class on Pendleton Jackets.

888
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And sewing them.

889
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh, huh.

890
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Mm-hmm.

891
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, in Pendleton Jacket had a lot of the principles of sewing.

892
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know, the pockets and the...

893
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But it wasn't really complicated.

894
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Really?

895
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
But it had a lot of principles of sewing.

896
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So I found that very much fun to teach people the basics.

897
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So what kind of things did your family do?

898
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Were you able to do some things as a group with all six of you?

899
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Or was that really too many kids to take little trips with and things like that?

900
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Oh, no.

901
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
We used to take the kids fishing every Sunday out at Quartz Creek.

902
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And then Bruce and Betty had a pond out...

903
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Well, it was out towards...

904
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Or was that out?

905
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
We went out to the Y and turned towards Wallport and what would we call that?

906
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I don't know.

907
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I weigh 34.

908
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah.

909
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And then they had some timberland out there that they had a pond on.

910
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And there was a group of us that were quite...

911
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It was the Jim Hallons, the RT Rises, the Budcrolls.

912
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And...

913
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Well, I guess that was at Bruce and Betty.

914
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And us.

915
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And we all worked together usually on Memorial Day, Fourth of July.

916
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
What's the other holiday?

917
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Labor Day.

918
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Labor Day.

919
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah.

920
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I haven't taken a guess.

921
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Usually went out to the pond.

922
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And then, Kirby and I always took the kids and we went to...

923
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We owned some property out...

924
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Big elk.

925
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And we went out there, crawdading.

926
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Oh.

927
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I got a great picture for you to put in the book on the crawdads.

928
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

929
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And then we would ask somebody to come and eat crawdads.

930
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We had crawdads feed.

931
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Big pile of crawdads.

932
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And then we...

933
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
As I say, we took the kids fishing up Quartz Creek.

934
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And then finally we got a boat.

935
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And by then, the Rises had a place at Triangle Lake.

936
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And we would go down there sometimes with our boat and...

937
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And the kids watered ski.

938
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Oh, that's fun.

939
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That was when they were older maybe.

940
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yes.

941
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So, Kermit enjoyed his family life, it sounds like.

942
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh, yeah. He was a family man.

943
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'll tell you.

944
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:19,000
When he had the mill, he would sometimes go and get equipment from other mills that were maybe no longer in service.

945
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And he would say when he left, well, I may not be back tonight because we might have trouble loading or, you know, doing all this.

946
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Almost always, he'd be home by midnight.

947
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Uh-huh.

948
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
He'd never stayed over any less.

949
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
He just wanted to be there in the family.

950
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, he wanted to be home with the family.

951
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I never had any concerns about him full-handering.

952
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That's a good thing.

953
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Help, he was definitely a family man.

954
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
How about summer vacations?

955
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Did you guys ever take any trips?

956
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Not really as summer vacations, but we, of course, had the place up the McKinsey, which was really nice because he had been in the three seas up there, which I told you about it.

957
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And so we had that in common, too, because I taught school up there.

958
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And so when we came to having a second home or the second, whatever, it wasn't really a home.

959
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It was a mobile, no.

960
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
What do you call those?

961
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Not a mobile.

962
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Yeah, I guess a mobile home.

963
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Like a trailer?

964
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Uh-huh.

965
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, it was a trailer-like place.

966
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And so when we bought the property to put the trailer on, it was up the McKinsey, because we'd been up there a lot, because we liked that area.

967
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So he had done trail building when he was there in the CCC?

968
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes.

969
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Interesting.

970
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So that made for a good weekend getaway, probably.

971
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I guess it was.

972
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It was great place and the kids loved it.

973
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And they loved to fish.

974
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And we had three great fishing holes on that property.

975
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And we liked it so well that after we'd had the mobile home for a while, it was a single wide.

976
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And we decided that we liked it well enough, and we wanted a fireplace, because then it was cozy, and we could use it in the wintertime.

977
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So we had him haul away that one, bring up a double wide.

978
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And I had that for a number of years after Kermit died.

979
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But all of a sudden there was a crack house moved in next door, and the people who owned that were from California, and they rented it out.

980
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And they brought up a lot of antiques and put in it.

981
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And it was just a gorgeous place.

982
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:12,000
They rented it out, and it was a crack house, and the people who had it needed wood for their fireplace, and they burned up all of the antiques.

983
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I thought they'll probably be over here next.

984
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And I thought this is no place for me, so I sold it.

985
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And it just killed me to sell it.

986
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It was 40 miles from any fire or police help.

987
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sure.

988
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There was no place for a single woman.

989
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yeah, that's understandable.

990
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So I had to give it up, and I still hate it that we had to give that up.

991
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, sounds like you had lots of good years from it.

992
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
No.

993
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm not that fun out there.

994
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I just have good memories.

995
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

996
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's a good thing, too.

997
01:11:52,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So you mentioned having your holidays with Bruce and Betty, and I realized I've never asked you what the transition was from when Bruce was sort of a nerdy kid who sat in

998
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the medias, and it's like a video time.

999
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
When did you start to get close to him?

1000
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Well, I think that Betty had a lot to do with that because she met Bruce because I had invited her to a summer party when we were in high school.

1001
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
When she was going to college here, and her father was an ROTC professor.

1002
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
He was a military man.

1003
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And so Bruce offered to take her home after the snook.

1004
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And so they were soon married, and then we did a lot of things together.

1005
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We used to camp up at Spirit Lake where we had spent our Bruce and I had spent our childhood.

1006
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And so we did a lot of things together, and then after Bruce died, Betty and I traveled a lot together.

1007
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So she brought the two of you closer together?

1008
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So she brought him out of it.

1009
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:11,000
He became a lot more. After he was in the military, I think he became a lot more social.

1010
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah, that's right because you had told me that you saw each other a lot in San Francisco too.

1011
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yes.

1012
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yes, that's right.

1013
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, I'd love to hear a little bit about your children.

1014
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Okay. Now we're early.

1015
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, I guess we should start early.

1016
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Well, Ken's the oldest.

1017
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And he was born in Portland.

1018
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And he was a good baby.

1019
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
He was a real...

1020
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
We had him.

1021
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I don't know. Did we tell you?

1022
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Did we talk about the house that we had in Portland?

1023
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Not in great detail, no.

1024
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, I told you that the first house was this apartment in the safe way.

1025
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Where the safe way is now in the Lloyd Center.

1026
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Well, then we moved over to the house that Ken was born from.

1027
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It was the Westminster Presbyterian Church Mance.

1028
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And it was a four-story house.

1029
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It had a basement, a main floor, a four-bedroom, second floor, and a floor attic.

1030
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And so we called it the Roth Hotel because everybody came to see the...

1031
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The came to Portland, stayed with us.

1032
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh, your friends.

1033
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Well, Ken was born from there.

1034
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And then Craig came along.

1035
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And that was when we...

1036
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Craig was about six months old when we moved to Curve Alice.

1037
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And the house that we had there was all these floors.

1038
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And it had six plugins.

1039
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Well, three of them, I think, were in the kitchen or maybe four.

1040
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I would gas slides.

1041
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
A sink that was way down here.

1042
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And I was pregnant with Craig.

1043
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And so, Kermit took out the kitchen and put in what they called a Youngstown...

1044
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Youngstown sink.

1045
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And it was a sink with train boards, all one piece.

1046
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And so we put it up so I could do dishes.

1047
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And then we had Craig.

1048
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And the thing that I remember about Ken when he was a little kid,

1049
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
he had a rabbit that he loved, stuffed rabbit with stuffed.

1050
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And we had a backyard that we fenced.

1051
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And so one day he was missing.

1052
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:21,000
The lady who had been helping me with Craig had left the gate open.

1053
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Well, I was just beside myself.

1054
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So we lived at Wider, I think it was.

1055
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Anyway, it was two blocks down to Broadway.

1056
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And here he was walking along with it holding the ears of the rabbit,

1057
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
just wandering around having a good time.

1058
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I was just friends.

1059
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
He was a very adventurous child.

1060
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Then Craig came along and he was born with no bicep,

1061
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
or no tricep, and he's left arm.

1062
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
They think I had interunion and polio.

1063
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:12,000
That was when polio was so becoming something that was everybody had to have a shot.

1064
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So Craig was never athletic.

1065
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ken was always very athletic.

1066
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But Craig was, when he'd ride a tricycle, he could do a tricycle pretty well,

1067
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and he seemed to bicycles.

1068
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
He couldn't balance because he couldn't get that arm up.

1069
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So when he was in, we moved to Kervales,

1070
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
and when he was about,

1071
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I would say maybe six weeks or so in Dachindee Garden.

1072
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The doctor that we had here in Kervales said,

1073
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I want you to go down to San Francisco and go to Stanford Medical School

1074
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and see what they can do for him.

1075
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Because he'd come in and he's a little face.

1076
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
He'd fallen off his bicycle, you know, and his face was all scarred up.

1077
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
He just didn't have any balance.

1078
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
So we took him down there.

1079
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The story that I'd love to tell about Craig is,

1080
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
my folks took us down to go, we were going to fly down to San Francisco

1081
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
and it was fogged in, and so we had to go on down and go by rail.

1082
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, Kermit and I were just beside ourselves.

1083
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,000
This was a very nerve-wracking experience for both of us to be taking this child down to the hospital.

1084
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We didn't know what was going to be the results of this.

1085
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So because my father was a T-totler,

1086
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
we didn't ever drink at home.

1087
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
We always called it juice.

1088
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And so we went in to have some juice in the railroad car.

1089
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And we got a coke for Craig.

1090
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And the bartender there put a cherry in it.

1091
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And so when he came, he had the operation and came out of the anesthesia.

1092
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And he was his legs and his arms were just thrashing.

1093
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And he yelled out, just an allowed voice, I want a cherry in my.

1094
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
We were never able to tell my parents that that's what happened.

1095
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Oh, cute.

1096
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And I think that's such a hot ass store.

1097
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And the little things that were just in his subconscious at that time.

1098
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So anyway, we got through that.

1099
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And then Kathy was born.

1100
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And we were, we just expected another boy.

1101
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You know, we were just thrilled to have this daughter.

1102
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And then Kim was born four years later.

1103
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And the girls were really quite good seamstresses.

1104
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I suppose that I taught them a lot of those things.

1105
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And they earned, they were blue ribbon winners for four H,

1106
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
for their dresses that they made.

1107
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I think it was Kathy went on to state fair, got a blue ribbon.

1108
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
They were really good seamstresses.

1109
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Still, they don't do much.

1110
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I think Kathy does more than Kim.

1111
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But they were very active in four H.

1112
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So were you still involved in four H?

1113
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yes, and later when I was on the four H,

1114
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I was a trustee for the four H.

1115
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Steve board that they had.

1116
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And was, my dad was very instrumental in obtaining the property for four H,

1117
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
of the four H camp that's over near Salem.

1118
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Right.

1119
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And I was very active in that for a long time.

1120
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Were you a four H leader as well when the children were younger?

1121
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yes.

1122
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And I think I told you that Irma Seymour was my four H leader.

1123
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I think we talked about that.

1124
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So you worked with him.

1125
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So I've always been active in four H.

1126
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And still am to a certain extent.

1127
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
We support the swimming pool at the camp.

1128
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I read that.

1129
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So interesting.

1130
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Were the boys in four H as well?

1131
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
No, they were both Eagle Scouts.

1132
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And in fact that conversation was about that because my great grandson is now in Scouting.

1133
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Wow.

1134
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And so I took all the Scouts always were red flannel jackets.

1135
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And I happened to remember that in the cupboard out there I had craigs of Scouts from his Scouting.

1136
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Wow.

1137
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And so I gave it to my great-grandchild.

1138
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I took all the things off of it and handed it to the cleaners.

1139
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Oh no.

1140
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's going down there.

1141
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
That's fun.

1142
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah.

1143
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That's funny.

1144
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I think I read somewhere that Kermit was involved too with the boys Scouting.

1145
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yes.

1146
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
With the, I don't know what they call that.

1147
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
The headquarters are in Eugene for this area.

1148
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And he was active in that management of that.

1149
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
At the regional level.

1150
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't know what they call them trustees or what they call them.

1151
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Anyway, he was active in that for quite a while.

1152
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
That was wonderful.

1153
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So as a home economist you think that you were more prepared than other women going into this whole child-bearing thing to be able to be-

1154
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I suppose so.

1155
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You know, because we learned a lot of child education and what we were supposed to do and how we were supposed to handle problems and that sort of thing.

1156
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yeah.

1157
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I think probably.

1158
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Did you continue to do the kind of things that you had been teaching other women to do with in terms of preserving food and-

1159
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well, I've always worked with the extension service to a certain extent.

1160
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
You know, even as a volunteer.

1161
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And I think that I did.

1162
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I followed through on a lot of that.

1163
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
What do you think was your strength as a mother?

1164
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Do you think there was something that you were in the family that everybody depended on you for?

1165
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Cooking, I think.

1166
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I think a good meal.

1167
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
That's a very important point.

1168
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Well, and I think that we cooked healthy meals because I had learned that.

1169
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You know, we always had meat and probably potatoes of some sort or rice or starch of some sort.

1170
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And vegetables and salad.

1171
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
My husband always wanted to salad because when he was in the service he didn't have any greens at all.

1172
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And I think we mentioned that he wanted lettuce when his brother came to visit him.

1173
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And he always wanted greens.

1174
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So we always had balanced meals and we always sat down to eat together.

1175
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And of course later my dad ate with us.

1176
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:21,000
That's something that I would not do again because I don't think it was fair to my children.

1177
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
When you sit down to eat your evening meal the kids want to talk about their days.

1178
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And my dad wanted to sort of, he was the conversationalist and he wanted to tell us about his day.

1179
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And I don't think it was fair to my children to do that.

1180
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But you know, you did what you had to do at the time.

1181
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They accommodated.

1182
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But it's true, it's not all that common out.

1183
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
They have a regular meal that in itself is that.

1184
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But as a result, Kermit came home every day for lunch from the meal because you know it was just a short distance.

1185
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And that was our quiet time together.

1186
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The two of you.

1187
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Because we hear and often, well, sometimes not quite often, he would bring salesman home for lunch.

1188
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And he said, the thing to do was for the salesman to take him out, you know, try to win his favor.

1189
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1190
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And he'd say, oh no, let's go home.

1191
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Geno cook something.

1192
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And so I think that that was our time together and it was also, I always had something in the pantry like a can of chicken or I could do a zillion things with chicken.

1193
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:54,000
You know, it was chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken dumplings.

1194
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You know, there were lots of things I could do on the spur of the moment to.

1195
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So and sometimes he'd just call 1130 and say, can I bring someone so home and I'd say, oh sure, you know.

1196
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And when you say can of chicken, was that something that you had canned?

1197
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
No, no, it wasn't.

1198
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
No, I didn't want anything to do with those chickens.

1199
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Yeah.

1200
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I wanted them prepared.

1201
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
That's one of the luxuries we have now.

1202
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So tell me if you're getting tired or are you still doing all right?

1203
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
No, I'm doing fine, but I suppose we ought to quit around three.

1204
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
All right.

1205
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I'll move through this.

1206
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I was, I'm almost in the same age range as your children, so I'm thinking about the era when you were raising kids and thinking about how it was such an era of change and more permissiveness and that sort of thing from.

1207
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yes.

1208
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Certainly from the era when you had been raised and you had been raised in such a strict way anyway.

1209
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes.

1210
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Was that a tough transition for you to make to figure out how to set rules and discipline for your kids?

1211
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Well, I think that there was a lot of discipline.

1212
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You don't do this because your grandfather was this way.

1213
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And the other thing that I remember vividly, and I don't remember whether I told way this or not, but one day the teacher called me up when Kim was in school.

1214
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And she said, we're talking about letting the girls wear pants to school.

1215
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And what did I think about it?

1216
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And I said, makes a lot of sense to me.

1217
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
They turned their little bottoms upside down on all the playground.

1218
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Well, yeah, on the playground thing.

1219
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I said, makes a lot of sense to me.

1220
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And so that's when children, because otherwise I see pictures of my kids in their grade school era.

1221
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And they always had dresses on.

1222
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then all of a sudden the pants became popular.

1223
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yeah, I can remember when you have to change out of our school clothes into our play clothes.

1224
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yes, that's right.

1225
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And those play clothes usually were pants.

1226
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah, that did change at a certain point.

1227
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But you got through those teenage years without too much.

1228
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
No, my girls didn't date.

1229
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Ken dated in college, but I don't remember that.

1230
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Well, he did date when he was a senior.

1231
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But I don't remember that we had to any concerns about that.

1232
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Good.

1233
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
They were pretty, you know, they had learned.

1234
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I used to tell him, don't misbehave because somebody knows you and somebody is going to towel on you.

1235
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I say the same thing. It's the beauty of living in a small town.

1236
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Were there particular stages of childhood that you enjoyed more than others?

1237
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Like did you love that stage when they were just little and...

1238
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yes, I did.

1239
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And I think that I probably enjoyed the girls when they were all maybe six to twelve or something like that.

1240
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I really liked that age.

1241
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
They were old enough to be talk to and sensible.

1242
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:42,000
You know, you could kind of guide them through that period.

1243
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I really enjoyed that part of it, I think.

1244
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
How about the boys?

1245
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
The boys were always so active in scouting.

1246
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I think Kermit did a lot of the parenting at that age with the boys because he would take and camping with the scouts.

1247
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And he would arrange to have them go and meet with other people to get their badges.

1248
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I think he did a lot of the parenting with the boys.

1249
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
It's interesting.

1250
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,000
He'd take them to the mill and lots of times he'd come home if he had to go to Eugene or Portland for a part or something.

1251
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
He would come by and grab one of the boys and take them.

1252
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And that was very helpful to me because that gave me a little freedom.

1253
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And I remember one time he was coming back from Eugene and he and Craig were singing.

1254
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And he wasn't watching this pedometer and he got stuck.

1255
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So the cop said something about what were they doing?

1256
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And Craig piped up and says, oh, Danny and I were singing!

1257
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:12,000
And the cop said, you know, if more dads would do that, we'd be a lot better off.

1258
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
You can go.

1259
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So we did the rest of it.

1260
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
That was a little story.

1261
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
That was interesting.

1262
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
But then either of your boys went into that field, into what products or...

1263
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
No, or a tree or anything.

1264
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
No, Ken started out in forestry.

1265
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And then he would go out and have field trips and he'd get poison oak.

1266
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And he came back one day and he told us he said, forestry isn't for me.

1267
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And he didn't go to the woods.

1268
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And by that time I think he was seeing the writing on the wall too about that it was going to go that way.

1269
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So he changed and went into business.

1270
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
And neither of the girls was ever interested.

1271
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh no, girls, in that air, I don't see.

1272
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
And he was starting to come into being...

1273
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I think they just had one or two girls in the forestry school.

1274
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And my dad didn't approve of that.

1275
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
He still had a big influence on your family.

1276
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Oh yes, he surely did.

1277
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Who this could be?

1278
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Oh, I'm stiff from sitting there.

1279
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
We've been here for a little bit.

1280
01:33:43,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I'm just a package.

1281
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I always bring the doorbell.

1282
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I didn't know what you know that he's there.

1283
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So your father was sounds like he was very influential in your life, even after your children were born.

1284
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Oh yes, I think he was.

1285
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And he really broiled the roost because of his eating with us.

1286
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah, I would say that.

1287
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And the children probably had that sense.

1288
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Like you say that there were eyes all over the town.

1289
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Yes.

1290
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
He was going to hear about it.

1291
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Oh, he was on the school board.

1292
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You know, he knew everything that was going on.

1293
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Did I tell you the story about him?

1294
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
They were trying to raise money for taxes.

1295
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But the school board was.

1296
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And the man came to Lyons Club.

1297
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And my dad was very prominent in the Lyons Club.

1298
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And he was the one who started, I don't know, you've been reading these articles that Ken Munford's been putting in.

1299
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Yeah.

1300
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And he was one of the principals who started the Avery.

1301
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Right.

1302
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And well, anyway, what was I going to say about that?

1303
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Well, he was in so many, oh, I know.

1304
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So the super kind of schools, I think it was Dr. Van Lohn.

1305
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And he came to the Lyons Club and made a plea for them to all vote for the increase in school property taxes.

1306
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And my dad got up and he said, well, I'd feel more inclined to vote for this.

1307
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:29,000
He said, you can keep going because the other one will catch you.

1308
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah.

1309
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,000
He said, my grandson was just kicked out of the first grade.

1310
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And something about one of the other kids.

1311
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Ken was kicked out of the first grade because he was a big boy and had a little bitty teacher for a teacher.

1312
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And she sent a note home and said that he was misbehaving.

1313
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And what was I going to do about it?

1314
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And so I went down to see about it and I said, what does he do?

1315
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And she said, well, he won't keep his feet under the desk.

1316
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And she said, I tried putting him out in the hall.

1317
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And he just sat out there and visited with everybody and enjoyed himself.

1318
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So she said, I guess that's not the way to handle it.

1319
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And so I looked at her and I said, where does Ken sit?

1320
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And she said there.

1321
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And I said, well, you know, if you go down to the sixth grade and get a desk, the fitting, you could probably, you probably wouldn't put his feet out in the hall.

1322
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Oh, she said, I never thought about that.

1323
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So anyway, my dad told this story at the Lions Club and the old Dr. Van Lone came up afterwards and he said,

1324
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:02,000
T.J., when you've got something like that, would you just come and tell me privately?

1325
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:11,000
But you know, he had a lot of clout because he wrote all these letters to the editor and had an opinion on everything.

1326
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And so the kids were pretty well.

1327
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
You know, if they didn't see Pop, they knew somebody, some of these friends would see them.

1328
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So they were pretty well.

1329
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Did I tell you that I used to worry?

1330
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:39,000
He would have articles in the paper about how many acres of timberlandy owned and something like this.

1331
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I think, oh, why do you put it in the paper?

1332
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It was about the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping and I was so worried that somebody, you know,

1333
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I think you were an easy target.

1334
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And I worried about that a lot.

1336
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
But nothing ever happened.

1337
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That's a good thing.

1338
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And how about your mom? Was she involved with your children?

1339
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
She was a good babysitter.

1340
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And you know, she had that cart that was the golf cart.

1341
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And she would come by in the afternoon and take the kids in the golf cart.

1342
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And she had to go down to the grocery store.

1343
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
She'd take them with her.

1344
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Oh, it was fun.

1345
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Yeah. So she was very much involved with the children.

1346
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I think she was more in jail with Bonn and Bart because Bruce and Betty traveled more than we did.

1347
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And she often kept them for several weeks at a time.

1348
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And then I would kind of take them for periods of time because I knew she needed to break.

1349
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Because, you know, she was getting older.

1350
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And so the boys came down and made a lot.

1351
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So logging roads with the trucks that my husband made.

1352
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
When he worked at, he worked at another business.

1353
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I forgot the name of it in Portland.

1354
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But it was during the war, beginning of the war.

1355
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And the V, not World War II, but World War.

1356
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Was it Vietnam? It was next.

1357
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Probably Vietnam, yeah.

1358
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And he worked at this die casting company.

1359
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And he worked at the dog trucks for kids size.

1360
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And the employees were allowed to take parts home that were not perfect.

1361
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And so, Kermit would bring them home.

1362
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And he made, I don't know, six or eight log trucks.

1363
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And these were big log trucks. They were about like that.

1364
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
And paint them.

1365
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And they had to buy the tires.

1366
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And they had little tires like that.

1367
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
But he would, I think, Kathy still has those log trucks.

1368
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I think that he made six or eight of those.

1369
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And he would convert them to flat beds or dump trucks.

1370
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:24,000
He would make little, the dump trucks would, he sort of changed the configuration of some of them.

1371
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But the Bonn and Bart and Ken and Craig would make logging roads all over the place.

1372
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
They loved to do that.

1373
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And they would play.

1374
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And it was really no trouble for me to keep them sometimes to give my mother a rest.

1375
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Sure, yeah. Were they about the same age as your boys?

1376
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Yes, well, there was Craig.

1377
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Let's see, Bonn, then Kermit came into the family, then Ken, then Bart, then Craig, and then Kathy.

1378
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And then Kim came along later.

1379
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So the boys were pretty well.

1380
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Yeah, so they were pretty much the same age.

1381
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Did you guys do holidays and things with their family?

1382
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh, yes.

1383
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Christmas and...

1384
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah, we always had things giving in Christmas with them.

1385
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

1386
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I think you said when you were talking to Wade about Christmas that your dad was a little shocked that your holidays were more extravagant than the ones that you had had when you were growing.

1387
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Yes.

1388
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Oh, yeah, we gave too much to the children.

1389
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And I'm saying the same thing about mine.

1390
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Every generation probably feels that way.

1391
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Yeah.

1392
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Oh, well.

1393
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But it's so much fun to indulge them.

1394
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I did have some questions about traveling.

1395
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Do you have any just 503 now?

1396
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Could I ask you a little bit more about traveling?

1397
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I talked a little bit about your trip that the two of you took to Japan and that kind of thing.

1398
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And you didn't take any trips with the children during that time when they were growing up.

1399
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Oh, yes.

1400
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
We did.

1401
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
We took them to Hawaii several times.

1402
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But we didn't ever take them farther than that.

1403
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I don't think.

1404
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Why is it a big trip for a family of six?

1405
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Yes.

1406
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yes, it was.

1407
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It was quite a... quite a... jaunt.

1408
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And what island did you go to when you went there?

1409
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I think we went to the big island because we went up to the volcano.

1410
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
We thought that was educational.

1411
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yes.

1412
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah.

1413
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And then Ken would sometimes come by himself or Craig when they were a little bit older.

1414
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But we'd take the two girls and then we took the two girls to Australia.

1415
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But this was when the boys were older and Ken was married and Craig was...

1416
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Or was Craig.

1417
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I guess maybe he was married too when we took the girls to Australia.

1418
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
What inspired a trip to Australia?

1419
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
How did you choose that?

1420
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Well, no, what made us go to Australia?

1421
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I think we just started wanting to go...

1422
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Kermit always wanted to go that direction.

1423
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
He never wanted to go to Europe.

1424
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I think we just thought that was a good place to go.

1425
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And I think Kathy wanted to go.

1426
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
She wanted to go.

1427
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
It was the time they were building the music center.

1428
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
We're like opera houses.

1429
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And I think that she was very interested in the way that was constructed.

1430
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Yeah, that's an amazing thing.

1431
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Because Kermit and she spent one whole day of our trip photographing it and walking around it and going through it.

1432
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And she did a report for class at Oregon State and got some credits for doing all of that.

1433
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So she knew from the very beginning that she wanted to be an architect.

1434
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yes, she did.

1435
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
She loves architecture.

1436
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Wonderful.

1437
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
What does your younger daughter do?

1438
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
She wanted to be a nurse.

1439
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But she met her husband instead.

1440
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And so then she took education.

1441
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Oh, well...

1442
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
She's been a school teacher and a substitute teacher.

1443
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
That's wonderful.

1444
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Well, I guess she never was a regular teacher because when they were married, she had twins quite early in her married life.

1445
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And so I think she just did substituting.

1446
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
But she loves teaching.

1447
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
So you've stayed very close with your children.

1448
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Sounds like.

1449
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Oh, yeah.

1450
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
As adults, you're all still there.

1451
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
You know, they're here now.

1452
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Kermit and Wald are here.

1453
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
That's right because they're building the courtyard.

1454
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Courtyard.

1455
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Are you involved with that project?

1456
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Well, somewhat.

1457
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Yeah.

1458
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
When they get in a bind, I help them out.

1459
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Not only financially, but otherwise too sometimes.

1460
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Because you have that experience with dealing with contractors and real estate things.

1461
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Have you worked with any of your other children on construction projects or real estate projects?

1462
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
No.

1463
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
They're all kids very handy.

1464
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Like he's dad.

1465
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
He's very...

1466
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
He can do anything.

1467
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And Craig's pretty handy.

1468
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
But he's...

1469
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
His recreation consists of hunting and fishing.

1470
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Is that something they used to do with their dad too? The hunting?

1471
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Oh, yes.

1472
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
They always got their deer.

1473
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
We had some forest lands out here.

1474
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And we reserved that for family hunting.

1475
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And so there were other people shooting around them.

1476
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Good idea.

1477
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And so they've always hunted and fished.

1478
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But Ken doesn't do that much, but Craig does a lot too much.

1479
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Well, I think it's admirable that you're still so close with everybody.

1480
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Well, I think we're as close as...

1481
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You know, we talk probably every week, at least.

1482
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Sometimes, you know, if there's something going on, we talk every other day.

1483
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
You know, just like Gary called me.

1484
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
You know, he...

1485
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Well, he wants, but he calls me every once in a while.

1486
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
That's my grandson.

1487
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Your grandson.

1488
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So, it's kind of nice.

1489
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1490
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And it sounds like you must have been the kind of mother that everybody was sort of comfortable with.

1491
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Well, I guess they were.

1492
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Because they share, you know, they keep in touch.

1493
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Uh-huh.

1494
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That's a nice thing to be able to say.

1495
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah.

1496
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Good.

1497
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Good.

1498
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Well, we could take a break here, as you'd like.

1499
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
All right.

1500
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Next time we'll go on to talking a little bit about more about your community work.

1501
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And we can, you know, we can start back in these days when you were involved with your kids and trying to work around.

1502
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah, I had a couple of things here about when we lived over on Jackson Street,

1503
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
but we had a...

1504
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
a holly...

1505
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
a whole row of holly trees.

1506
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Uh-huh.

1507
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And so every Christmas we trimmed the holly trees, and then the girls would put them...

1508
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:21,000
put the clippings in the wheelbarrow, and they'd go up and down Jackson Street and ask anybody if they wanted holly for Christmas.

1509
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Uh-huh.

1510
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
And they just gave it to them, you know.

1511
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Oh, sweet.

1512
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So that was kind of nice.

1513
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Uh-huh.

1514
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Did you have some other holiday traditions that were different or leftover from your growing up years?

1515
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Uh-huh.

1516
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I don't know that we...

1517
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
we certainly had food that was very traditional, but uh...

1518
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
we always had turkey and always had dressing, and uh...

1519
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I could tell you some funny stories about that.

1520
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And sew it pudding.

1521
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Uh-huh.

1522
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That was carrot pudding, steam pudding.

1523
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
And uh...

1524
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Interesting.

1525
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
And we usually had boiled onions, little pearl onions.

1526
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Uh-huh.

1527
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
And uh...

1528
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
cranberry ice.

1529
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You always had that.

1530
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Uh-huh.

1531
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
As an ice cream?

1532
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
What is cranberry ice that is...

1533
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Oh, no, it's a...

1534
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
it's an ice that you eat with meat.

1535
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Oh, you know.

1536
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
It's a pear to that.

1537
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Oh, very fancy dinner has the clearier palate, you know.

1538
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
So the shape...

1539
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Was it shaped in balls or...?

1540
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
No, we always just made it, uh...

1541
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
you know, with a beater.

1542
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And then we scoop it out and put it in a little sherbet dish.

1543
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Oh.

1544
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
And that was served with all the hot things.

1545
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
With your turkey.

1546
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Sweet potatoes, candy, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy.

1547
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
That's standard menu always.

1548
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Still is.

1549
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Except for the sew it pudding, I haven't heard of anybody making sew it pudding in a very long time.

1550
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Well, we always made that carrot pudding, but it's made with sew it.

1551
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Uh-huh.

1552
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And uh...

1553
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
What do they call the stuff you put on the top of it?

1554
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:28,000
You know, you make it with sugar and egg and...

1555
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Meringue?

1556
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
What?

1557
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Meringue?

1558
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
No.

1559
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Why can't I think of the name?

1560
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I guess I haven't thought of it since last year.

1561
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Meringue and egg.

1562
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And it's not Meringue.

1563
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Well, I can't think of what it is now that we've always put on top of it.

1564
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I can still see my mother sitting in front of the fireplace before we had beaters.

1565
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Uh-huh.

1566
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And she would whip that stuff, took forever to me.

1567
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Not marshmallow.

1568
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
No.

1569
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
No.

1570
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Oh.

1571
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Did we talk about the Burlington family and Uncle Gus?

1572
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
No, but I'd love to hear about them.

1573
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
You didn't...

1574
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Well, we got to talk about...

1575
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
You talked about...

1576
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I know you talked to Wade about Uncle Gus bringing you raisins as a kid.

1577
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Yeah, well, that's what we've done that thing.

1578
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Um...

1579
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Well, I just...

1580
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
The date that...

1581
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I think I was going to look up some dates for you and Kermit died at 59 and he died in 1979.

1582
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Okay.

1583
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Had he been ill at all before that?

1584
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Well, not to...

1585
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
You know, he always was not just...

1586
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Well, we didn't...

1587
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I think that we always thought that he was fragile, but, you know, but didn't realize what it was.

1588
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
You know, in those days, heart things were...

1589
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
It was very different then.

1590
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Yeah.

1591
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Well, we made a big strides in heart.

1592
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Well, I guess that's all I had on my little...

1593
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I think, oh, we need to talk about this.

1594
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Yes.

1595
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's a good thing.

1596
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'm glad you took notes.

1597
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
And if you think about it, things definitely bring them in.

1598
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Yeah.

1599
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
So, Kermit died just of a sudden heart attack?

1600
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Yes.

1601
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:04,000
He was just fine and we had come back from a trip to Mexico and he went down.

1602
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
He was building a photography studio in the basement.

1603
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
He thought he'd take up photography as kind of an avocation.

1604
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:21,000
And he came upstairs and he said, are you ready to go and do errands downtown?

1605
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
And I said, yeah, I'm ready just as soon as I finish this note.

1606
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I said, I'm writing thank yous to the people that been nice to us.

1607
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:35,000
In Mexico and all of a sudden I looked over and he was laid out on the bed.

1608
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
And I said, Kermit, what's the matter?

1609
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And he just kind of looked at me, you know.

1610
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And I went over and I felt his forehead and it was just sweaty.

1611
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And I said, what is the matter?

1612
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I said, I think I better call the doctor.

1613
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
He said, yes, I guess so.

1614
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And I think he knew what he had.

1615
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
But I didn't at the time.

1616
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And so I called the doctor and he said, get him to the hospital, get him to the hospital.

1617
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And so I said, can you walk out to the car and he said he thought he could.

1618
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:16,000
So he did and then he threw up and you know, I ran to get a pan so that we could,

1619
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:23,000
if he threw up again, we could didn't need to stop and we got him out to the hospital.

1620
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And some little man came up.

1621
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I didn't know him from Adam.

1622
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And I think he thought that he, that I knew who he was.

1623
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
He apparently was the heart doctor.

1624
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And I didn't know him from Adam and as all he said to me, he says, your husband's a very sick man.

1625
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And I thought, well, what's he sick about, you know.

1626
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I said, well, can I see him?

1627
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And he said, yeah, go ahead and see him.

1628
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
But I still didn't know they had a heart attack.

1629
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And so he lived that day.

1630
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And then the next day they took him to Portland, OHSU.

1631
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And I was, February and it was, I see, oh, there was this much ice on the streets everywhere.

1632
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And I didn't think we'd ever make it uphill hill.

1633
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,000
But the ambulance, I don't know if they had chains or not, but they made it up the hill.

1634
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And I knew he was very sick when they, when they made everybody get out of the elevator and let us in.

1635
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I knew that there was something bad going on.

1636
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
So he just lived that night and he was gone the next day.

1637
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
So my life changed.

1638
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Yeah.

1639
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Yeah.

1640
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I don't think I really said I'm changed.

1641
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
You never know what the future brings, so you better live every day.

1642
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Yeah. Well, it sounds like he did live.

1643
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
He sounds like he enjoyed his life.

1644
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Oh, he did. He enjoyed every day.

1645
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Yeah.

1646
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Yeah. And lots of good hobbies and travel and stuff.

1647
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Yeah.

1648
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
It's still too short.

1649
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Hmm. Well, thank you for telling me about that.

1650
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Yeah, I'm eager to talk to you too about, I try to imagine you stepping into

1651
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
a car and taking over there at the property business and that sort of thing at that point.

1652
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I guess you had been so involved that it wasn't that big of a lead.

1653
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:45,000
No, it wasn't because I think he had a premonition all the time that he would, that I would outlive him because my family had, you know, sort of an older reputation of whatever.

1654
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And his family had always died suddenly.

1655
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And so he was pretty insistent that I be aware of everything that was going on and financial things.

1656
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Yeah.

1657
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
We always talked over every deal.

1658
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Uh-huh.

1659
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So I just went on from there.

1660
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I just picked right up and kept moving with it.

1661
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Oh, huh.

1662
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Good.

1663
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Well, next time I'd like to talk more about not only your community activism.

1664
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I have said many times that hate is like an asset that does as much damage to the vessel in which it is stored as to the object on which it is poured.

1665
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:45,000
The other one is Gem of the Day when the tide of life turns against you and the current rent current upsets your boat.

1666
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Don't waste tears on what might have been just lie on your back and float.

1667
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
That's wonderful.

1668
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Those are the two things that I look at.

1669
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Yep, words to live by.

1670
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Yeah.

1671
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Beautiful.

1672
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Thank you for keeping us.

1673
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Keep all that stuff there handy.

1674
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Uh-huh.
