1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
This is Maya Fischler. I'm in the home of Jean Starker-Raw and today is November

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:15,980
13th 2007. Today, Jean and I are going to be talking about some of the community

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,859
activities that she's been involved with and I'd like to ask her some questions

4
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,960
as well on a more philosophical side of things asking her to reflect a little

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:36,520
bit about her life and some of the things that she's accomplished. Okay. So when

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,120
we left off last time, you had just told me about Kermit's passing. At that time,

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,520
your children were grown, almost everybody was out of the house and in college

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,840
except for Kermit. Kermit still here. She was in the sorority house. She was the same

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,939
Kappa. And then when her dad died, by then she moved home to be with me. He did. And she

10
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:14,320
was engaged and to be married in June of that year, he died in February. And so she

11
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:22,199
said she'd come home and stay with me. And so I got to know my future son-in-law

12
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:31,479
quite well during that period. But it was a very tough time to be enthusiastic about

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,120
a wedding. And you know, I knew Kermit wasn't going to be with us. So anyway, that was

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,920
where that stood, I guess. Did you have other friends and that sort of thing at that era

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,000
who were really a comfort to you sort of took you through that difficult? No, not really.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,439
Well, I shouldn't say that. There were a couple of couples that really stood by me. But

17
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:16,039
it's amazing in that era. And I think it's true today when you are no longer a couple,

18
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:24,560
it's a different story. Different socials. Yes. And I had one lady tell me very bluntly.

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,560
She said, well, I won't be inviting you to dinners anymore. It makes an uneven number.

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:38,879
Interesting. Yeah. And so, you know, people see things differently. But I'm Izzy Hall

21
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:51,199
of CH2M Hall. She was a, she and Jim were wonderful support. And I've all, and now I'm

22
00:02:51,199 --> 00:03:01,199
kind of supporting them because Jim has a disease that we will not get well from. And

23
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:09,759
so I try to take her out to lunch and do things with her now. So you know, it all comes

24
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,280
full circle. Yes, it does. Yeah, that's an interesting statement to, because I think that

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,560
has probably changed in this generation. I don't think there is that same sense that

26
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,080
you only socialize with couples. There's a lot more relationships among women. Yes, that's

27
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
right. Good support. And there was at that time. And you've probably built those kind of

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:39,560
relationships gradually as you will. Yes. And, and you know, the thing of it is that I

29
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:49,400
think that people don't realize when you're in your 50s what it's going to be like when

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:59,159
you're alone, when you're in your 80s. And people are much more aware of that, I think

31
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,360
now, than they used to be. People were more self-centered, I think. And then the other thing

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,760
that I think about my life is that Herman and I did everything together. We were big on going

33
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:24,960
places with other couples. We went with our family. We went, we went fishing. We went, he went

34
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,759
hunting with the boys. And I did my little things with the hospital and that sort of thing.

35
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:44,000
But basically we did our social things just together. Yes. So you had a really special bond and

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,120
that's that's hard to recreate. That's right. Or substitute. So what kind of things did you do in

37
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,959
that time to kind of move you through the through the morning stage and help you plan the wedding.

38
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,759
And that was a full time job. I can imagine. And of course when a person dies there's so much to

39
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:23,759
take care of. And as I've mentioned before I had very little money that was coming in routinely.

40
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:32,560
I had to figure out how I was going to support myself and whether I had to go back to work or what

41
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:42,879
I was going to do. Because we had a lot of assets but we didn't have any cash flow. And so I hired a man

42
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:54,720
to manage my first lands that were left over from the mail. And as I've said before I trusted him

43
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,720
implicitly but I really didn't feel like I had a handle on it because I didn't know anything about

44
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:13,200
Timberland and managing it. And so he did a lot of work on

45
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:25,920
I don't know what they call that. He drew pictures of the forest and then where we should log and

46
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:36,959
what we should do with different sections of it. And I wish I could put that better. But anyway that went

47
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,239
on for a couple of years. And when I needed some money I'd say you know you got them log.

48
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:54,639
But then I decided that after I got my wits about me and got kind of settled down I thought well

49
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:04,959
you know I know a lot about real estate and how that works. So I think I'll do it 1031 just like my

50
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:19,599
father did. And so I sold off the timber manager surveyed the timberland that I wanted to sell first

51
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,919
and to see how much I could get from that. And so then I found a building that I could buy.

52
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:36,400
And so we changed those two and that worked out so well that I did it four more times.

53
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,720
Because that gave you at least a regular source of that's right because I had the money coming in

54
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,000
from the rents from the real estate. And then I knew how much I had to spend.

55
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:58,800
So anyway that worked out very well and it's still to this day I own those properties.

56
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,959
He said the by-mart property was one of those two.

57
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,639
Well the by-mart was a little different because I had inherited that from my mother's estate.

58
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:17,920
And so that was a little bit different but it also had a 30 year lease on it which was

59
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,759
just peanuts. You know because it was so such an old lease. Yeah why my father did that I do not know

60
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:35,440
but anyway there wasn't much income from that. I see. Not like it is today. Yeah.

61
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,840
Is that still your property today? Yes. I own that corner there.

62
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:52,080
Ninth and circle and it's been very now that I have a decent lease.

63
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,440
Well it gives me some income. That's good. So you got involved in your real estate business and

64
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,680
was at the time that you sort of started getting involved in community activities now?

65
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes. And I had always been interested in the hospital because

66
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:22,480
my dad had always he was one of the movers and chakers when the hospital was in bankruptcy

67
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,360
down here on the Harrison Street. And he and a group of other men pulled that hospital out of

68
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:42,320
the the the got it going again. And then my husband was interested in the hospital and served on

69
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:51,200
the board of the hospital when they moved from Harrison out to the hill. And so I was always

70
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:00,399
involved in the auxiliary and my mother and Mrs. Ed Woodcock were the two ladies who started

71
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:10,639
the held a tea and asked women to come and that's how the auxiliary started the present hospital.

72
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,879
That's interesting. So that we were always involved as a family more or less in the hospital.

73
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:29,600
And of course I I'm a wind curmud guy. They need me. I am an honorary trustee of the

74
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,360
trustee board. And so I've been very active in that and helped raise money for

75
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,279
the various projects that they've had like the Pashtaga house. I was

76
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:56,240
co-chair with the heart center with with Mario Pashtaga. And then I also supported him when he

77
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:08,159
wanted to do his house. They call it the house. So he and I worked together real closely on that.

78
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:16,560
Yeah. Fundraising for the most part. Yes. And I were you also involved in a cancer center there

79
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,240
at the hospital? Yes. And they're the hallway out in that building is named for a curmud.

80
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:33,279
Was that his project as well? No. Not really. I think that was pretty much my project.

81
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,799
But it was one of the first fundraising projects that I had.

82
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:47,440
Because I knew a lot of people in town. And I kind of knew who to ask.

83
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah. That's what's important.

84
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,040
You have a long list of things that you've been involved with here. And I could ask you about

85
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,520
each one of them. But you could also just tell me to direct me a little bit. Which ones you feel

86
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:18,720
are your major points of pride? Well of course the park is very much. And that was an interesting

87
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,840
how that came about. I yielded or built this house. And when we were through building it,

88
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:38,240
he came to me and asked me if I would loan him some money to he owned the corner where the park is.

89
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,399
And he asked he had plans drawn up and he was going to build a big high rise,

90
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,159
something rather there of office buildings. And I said no I said I don't think that's what

91
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:59,120
ought to be on that corner. And I said the chamber is next door. You're going to hide the chamber

92
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,720
of commerce building. And as people come over the bridge, they will not see where the chamber is.

93
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,840
And I said I don't think that ought to be built on that corner. Well he picked up on that.

94
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,879
Within I think it was just two or three weeks. It was very short period of time.

95
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:33,440
There was a consensus between the university, the city, and the chamber. And they all pitched in

96
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,680
and bought that property from Ike. And then they came to me and asked if I would landscape it.

97
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:52,320
And so that's how Kermit's name is on that part. I see. So that all worked out just fine. Everybody

98
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:02,400
was happy. And I still look after it. And I get after him when they don't keep the park up because

99
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:11,360
I have also donated funds to the N County Foundation for the purpose of keeping that park up.

100
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,720
And they're supposed to use it for the, you know, to put in some perennials and that sort of thing.

101
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,079
And now I'm after the chamber because their trees have grown up so much that you can't see

102
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,759
their building. And I think they ought to take those trees down. And so that when people come

103
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,840
over the bridge they can see where the chamber is. That's true. Yeah. So anyway I'm working on that.

104
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,879
It's good. Never stop that kind of thing. Keep them spiffed up there.

105
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Now let's see. The other thing I think is that I belong to the homeic.

106
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:02,399
And that was started. My interest in that was a long long long ago.

107
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:14,480
Azeria Saker was the lady in charge of the homeic part of the state extension service.

108
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,159
And she and I had known each other because of course I'd grown up in Kervalis and they lived not far

109
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:30,000
from us. Well, when I was teaching school up in McKenzie by she called me one day. Was that in

110
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,440
Wades? Well, taking the job within class up for that. No, no, no. This is different day.

111
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,240
So I was up the McKenzie teaching and that summer before the summer was out. She called me

112
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:56,080
wanting to know if I wanted to job in Lane County doing work with people who wanted to process

113
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:07,360
their produce, either canning or freezing or whatever. And I said, oh, I'd love a job for the summer.

114
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,120
So she said, well, fine. And so then about halfway through the summer, why she called me and she said,

115
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,560
we have an opening in an Astoria for a war food assistant. And this is during the war.

116
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,479
Yes, you did tell me about that. Oh, okay. Well, then I won't repeat that.

117
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:37,039
Okay. And so that's how I got into the extension service because then the war food assistant was

118
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:47,039
then the class of county liked what we did up there with the women. And so they asked,

119
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:59,679
they, you see, extension services is funded by federal state and county funds. And so the county

120
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,920
was going to go ahead and do their part to fund the extension service and that guy was still going.

121
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,079
But I started that whole program up there. So that was part of the state home economic system?

122
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:24,480
Yes. And then you became a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, what they call a home demonstration age.

123
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,279
An administration. Otherwise known as a home demon.

124
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,279
That's kind of a positive and a negative. That word I guess you could see.

125
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:46,000
Huh. And then eventually you became the chair of the College of Home Economic Development Council.

126
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
Yes. That was the step that you took.

127
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:59,839
Yes. That was when a Kinsey Green was Dean. And I was a chairman of the advisory committee for

128
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:11,919
probably six or seven years. And then when Tammy Brave became the dean, why she asked me to

129
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:20,880
continue. However, we don't have a chairman. I don't think as such. We just have advisory committee.

130
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
I see. And what are the some of the projects that you did through that group that you're

131
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:37,519
going to do? Well, we, we raise money too for the, for the college. And we, we talk about where

132
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:46,240
the college is going, what, what needs to be done, what needs to be processed in the way of

133
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,079
whatever we think that people ought to be thinking about like, you know, they come,

134
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:06,400
when Tammy Brave took over that dean ship, it was combined with the College of Physical Education.

135
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:16,640
I think it was. And then they call it Health and Human Science. And so she came to me and wanted

136
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,519
to know about the history of home economic side of that. And then she had the other group.

137
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:33,680
And we formed them together. So now we do both. I see. And is that the group that started the

138
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Bates Family Study Center? Yes. And I was on that committee to, to help with that.

139
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,440
What is the purpose of that, that study center? It's mostly studies.

140
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:58,559
And either children development, which is the, the have a, they have a

141
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,680
archery nursery school there. And, and also gerontology.

142
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
I don't know.

143
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:17,200
There's a gerontology department also. And, so, but it's expanded a lot since we started. I think

144
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,480
there's lots of research goes on on there. I don't know. I think the, the bone density

145
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,440
project is probably in the basement of the women's building. I don't think it's over at the

146
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:41,360
Bates Center. But it's all intertwined. All that research. So the Bates Center is an actual

147
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:48,559
building. Yes. Yes. And, and, and, well, I was on the committee that helped fund that.

148
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,199
We raised quite a bit of money for that. Among them was the lady who was

149
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,359
the, the original Betty Crocker. And she was a graduate of Oregon State.

150
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,559
I didn't realize that. Yes. And, so, I'm trying to forget her knee. I think.

151
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:28,079
Anyway, she didn't, she, she came out here from and worked with us to get this, to get it going.

152
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,799
And took a big interest in it. And, of course, left us the big sum of money that the major donor

153
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,599
of that building, because it's named after her. Well, she didn't like much staying downtown at the

154
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:53,679
hotel. So, she used to come and stay with me. So, I enjoyed being with her because we, we had an

155
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,720
awfully good time when she stayed with me. And then I would take her, you know, around where she

156
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:10,000
wanted to go. That time I drove a lot better than I drive now. And so, I provided transportation

157
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,400
for her. What fun. So, she, was she older than you? Oh, yes. She's been gone many years now.

158
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,720
Yeah, she, she began to go downhill during the time that she gave the money to the

159
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,519
family study center. And then the last time she came out, she really wasn't herself. She came

160
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:43,759
with a gentleman who was her, oh, I don't know with you, calling him a kind of a consultant for their

161
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:54,559
money. And he took kind of, took over caring for her to, but she stayed with me and he stayed

162
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:04,319
downtown. That's fun. So, I asked Mercedez Bates. That's her thing. Mercedez Bates. That's her

163
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:13,839
thing. Yeah. So, you're an awful way to forget people like that. I just did it earlier today. So,

164
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:23,839
so you were also involved in the 4-H foundation at the state level? Yes, because my, I had,

165
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,599
I think we talked about that when, when I was growing up, I had the daughter of the head of the

166
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:42,879
state. Harry Seymour was head of the state. And I had her, his daughter for my 4-H teacher,

167
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:52,480
our leader, I guess you'd say. And so, I was always active in 4-H and when my children came along,

168
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,559
my they were active in 4-H. And both of the girls had, they were state winners and they're,

169
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:12,639
in the dress competition and they, they took, I taught them some, but they had a great leader,

170
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:21,679
Mrs. Wells was her name. They lived out on the corner of Walnut in 20.

171
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,880
Where's the stop sign at Walnut before you go up the hill?

172
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,920
The hill, there's a stop, light there, stop late at 27th and then 1 at 29th.

173
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Well, I think it's the 1 at 29th because that's the one where you go out 29th and go up and

174
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,559
around the hill and then down. Well, she lived at that corner and why she was a great leader.

175
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,680
She knew a lot about sewing and I thought it was better for the girls to get it from

176
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,920
somebody else than me. So, they went out there and sewed a lot for her.

177
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:14,640
And then my dad was one of the movers and shakers along with

178
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:28,400
the, Bert and Bert and the guy that was head of the state 4-H, his name.

179
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,920
We'll have to look that up because I don't remember what I, Bert and sticks in my,

180
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,920
Bert and Bert and Hutton.

181
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Hutton? Maybe that was the name.

182
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
I can check on that too.

183
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,800
Put a question mark on that because I don't know for sure.

184
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,440
Anyway, Bert and Hutton came, well, just say that's who it is.

185
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,160
Came to my dad and he wanted to buy this property over in Salem that was for sale and it was

186
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:10,880
Timberland. And so my dad went over there and the idea was to build a camp for 4-H's.

187
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,240
Well, it was a pretty big project and my dad was very involved in that.

188
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,640
And so then when it came along, I was a treasure, I think.

189
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:41,279
I don't know. I was some officer in the 4-H program that was established to run that camp.

190
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,799
At the state level?

191
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:50,160
Yes. And eventually we had to sell off half of the Timberland, which just killed me

192
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:58,560
because it was should have been self-sustaining. But you know, people don't realize that Timber

193
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:08,240
is a renewable resource and you just harvested every 40 years instead of every year like a lot of

194
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:18,400
crops. And so we could have, if we've been able to save that land, we could have had it rotating

195
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,920
so that we could have always had some income but didn't work out. But they did save half of it.

196
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:34,880
And now we've got a really wonderful fundraiser, Randy, his name, but I know what his last name is.

197
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:45,440
But he's great and he is running the camp and they're just, and they're getting

198
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,800
what do you call it? They're

199
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,920
I want to say they're applying for fundraising for grants.

200
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,360
For grants?

201
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:12,080
Yes, yes. And so now they're just doing really well and they're able to keep it up and it looks

202
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:26,480
great. And so I was involved in that as being on the 4-H board. And so I became very interested

203
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:38,079
in that because I wanted to see it go. And my dad provided money for the swimming pool of that

204
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,079
camp and then Kermit and I gave some money for the upkeep of it.

205
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,480
It seems like in general you had a few that swimming related gifts that you gave.

206
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,639
Yes. Because there are special reason that you were interested in.

207
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:59,919
Well, we were always thought that swimming was very important for Oregonians because we have so

208
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:08,000
much water and when we would see people drown because they couldn't swim, we thought

209
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,319
that was just terrible. And so we've always supported water-related activities.

210
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:24,079
And I still do that because I support through the Benton County Foundation. I support

211
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,640
all for instance lifts for people to get in and out of pools so they can swim.

212
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:39,280
And then I think we already talked about the girls going to camp.

213
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,880
To a spring win. Yes. And they didn't want to go back because it wasn't any swimming pool.

214
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,920
So Kermit and I talked it over and we'd made some money in the stock market. And so we decided we'd give

215
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,320
stock to them and so they built their swimming pool. But we wouldn't let anybody know that we'd

216
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,519
done that because we didn't want the kids to go to camp and everybody saying,

217
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,799
they gave to the swimming pool. So it's never been named or anything.

218
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,399
I think that's interesting. We didn't want the kids to know.

219
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,279
Yeah. So did your family always have a swimming pool?

220
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,240
Yes. We always had.

221
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,200
And your kids were growing up.

222
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,799
At least when Kermit and I, we always had a swimming pool. Of course my dad didn't because he

223
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,399
he supported the 4-H one but he didn't support family.

224
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,759
But we did have a pond out in the woods that we could use in the summertime.

225
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,240
Kermit was I think, did I tell you about him building that swimming pool?

226
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,480
No.

227
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, when we built our house over on Jackson Street we didn't have a swimming pool.

228
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:07,839
And so he came home one day and he said, what would you think if we put build a swimming pool

229
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:14,880
across on the property across the way that we owned? And he said, I could bring in 12 by 12

230
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:27,840
timbers and put them together in the corners. And then we could put your paper down for the paint job

231
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,360
and then put plastic around it. And it would be 4 feet deep.

232
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720
And I said, well, I think that would be great because the kids were little and they could

233
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,240
they could have a lot of fun and it was just like a big puddle pool.

234
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,680
So we did that and that I think that lasted for probably, oh probably five or six years every year

235
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,319
we would tear it down and re-put your paper in plastic and it would last the summer.

236
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:09,519
And then we decided we'd build a swimming pool. So we did that and

237
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:17,519
but it wasn't covered. And so that wasn't very satisfactory in Oregon.

238
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:27,359
So when he closed the mail, he came to me and he said, I've got to take the metal off the roof

239
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:39,919
of some of the machinery that are in the mail. And he said, if we cleaned it up and cut off the

240
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:47,919
end where the logs have hit it, he said, I could bring that metal in and we could have a building

241
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:55,440
over the pool. And I said, no thank you. I don't want a metal building in my yard.

242
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,400
And he said, well now just wait a minute. How tell you about how we're going to do this?

243
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,440
It's better than you think. So anyway, the back part of it was all metal and then we put

244
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:19,519
boards that was a very nice awning over the front of it. That was all wood and then we had

245
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,400
sliding glass doors and from the street you couldn't tell what it was.

246
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,120
It's still there. So it covered over the whole pool?

247
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:38,479
Yeah, it's interesting. And we built a sink and a bathroom out there and a boys and girls

248
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,759
dressing rooms. Wow. And it was really a nice little, okay. And of course we entertained all

249
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:54,399
of the kids and on the campfire girls, the boy scouts, the 4-H kids, whoever came around.

250
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,800
This was wonderful because the kids were at our house and we knew what they were doing.

251
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,759
Absolutely. And so it was just a wonderful pool for the kids all the time they were growing up.

252
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,160
That's great. And so that's still in use over there?

253
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,440
Oh yeah, so. That's good. Well that sort of leads me to my, I wanted to ask a little bit about

254
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,360
Kermit's community involvement because I know it sounds like he was also involved in the scouts

255
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:33,039
to a certain event. Yes, yes. With the scouts in Eugene, I don't know what level of scouting

256
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:40,079
that was but whatever it was he used to go down the Eugene to meetings with boy scouts and it was

257
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:49,599
very active and he did a lot of fundraising for the boy scouts and he always said that he didn't

258
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,440
like to ask people for money but because of his relationship with the male, there were lots of

259
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,039
times when he had partial lots of something that he couldn't really sell but they were very usable

260
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:17,360
so he would donate those. He liked in kind giving and he got canoes for the boy scouts and he

261
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:24,160
would ask various people who manufactured things if he thought the scouts could use it but then he

262
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,240
and that worked very well. In fact, I still do that a lot with my fund raising. We try to get

263
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,360
in kind gifts because people don't mind giving things that they've manufactured that

264
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,120
and those canoes were perfectly good but maybe they had a chip out of the paint or something they

265
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,799
couldn't sell but they were perfectly usable. Interesting. That's a great service to provide.

266
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:01,839
Yes. So, in giving was his thing. Interesting. He was also involved with the rotary and

267
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:09,119
and other groups around town. Yes, he was a Rotarian and after he died, I made him a fellow in the

268
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:19,519
Rotary Club and he was really fond of the Rotary Group. Were there some things that he was particularly

269
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,880
involved with that things in close to him? I don't remember that he was in particularly involved

270
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:36,239
with Rotary but he may have been more than I realized I don't know. But he was involved in the

271
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:50,399
church. He was a justee of the church. He did that and he wasn't a joiner really. He didn't like to

272
00:36:52,079 --> 00:37:00,559
join very much really. So, he did his work on the outskirts of the church? Yes. That works that well.

273
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:12,000
Another thing I have on the list of your credits is the EE Wilson Foundation. What's been your

274
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:21,039
involvement there? Well, I was on that for a number of years and Fred Zawallon was head of that

275
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:32,719
and managed it from the very beginning when EE Wilson died and I knew EE Wilson and so I guess

276
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:40,880
they thought that I would be interested in managing what he had given to the college and

277
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:54,640
what really wasn't to the college it was just I think it was kind of just given but he had to have a

278
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:03,360
board managing it and Pete Smith lived next door to us over on Jackson and he was on the board

279
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,720
and so then he got me involved and I was on that for a number of years.

280
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:19,920
Is that managing the lands or the money that was in the bank that was accumulating interest

281
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:31,599
and so forth and the duty of the board was to have kids apply for money from that and then we had

282
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:40,480
to read their applications and decide who was going to get what. So scholarships for OSU?

283
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:52,639
Yes. Well it could be, as I remember it it could be any I've kind of forgotten I think it's any

284
00:38:53,279 --> 00:39:00,400
Oregon school and I can't remember. That scholarship is still available I see it is.

285
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,199
Yes it is. It's a big surprise. It seems to me like it has to be Benton County youth.

286
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:13,599
Hmm, it could be. I think it is. Boy that was a long time ago when I served on that.

287
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,639
I see you haven't done that for a while. No. So most recently the things that you're still

288
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:27,199
involved in are you still involved in the 4-H or the economic? No I'm still I serve on

289
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:37,199
the advisory committee for the HOMEC, HOMEC, Health and Human Science and the library

290
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:47,119
and the hospital is an honorary trustee and the museum of Benton County Museum.

291
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:56,480
That's a lot of responsibilities. Well I've quit the just recently I've quit the museum

292
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:04,639
and I've quit the library so I'm down to the hospital and the Health and Human Science.

293
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,920
And you've quit them just to give yourself a little more free time? Yes. Yes. It's just too much.

294
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,880
It is but it's an incredible gift to the community. Do you think that as you were talking about

295
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,240
how you had a good year in the stocks or whatever and then you'd give to this cause or another?

296
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,240
Do you think that's still going on at that same level in in this day and age? That's the same

297
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:37,519
sense of philanthropy that people of your era had? No I don't think so. I think everything now is

298
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:46,320
based on what I can do to get rid of the money for tax purposes. Hmm. I really think that people give

299
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:55,039
to get their tax off. And of course I've always believed that I would like to give money

300
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:03,680
to something where I know it's going, then to taxes. So I try to give as much as I can

301
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:12,480
and not have to pay tax on it. Yeah. But it seems like your choice of beneficiaries has a lot

302
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,679
to do with your personal interests. Oh yes, absolutely. It's your way. Yes. You're personally involved

303
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,880
not only in terms of giving money but also in giving an expertise and advice. Yeah. Because

304
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,079
I want to know what they're doing with the money that come out. I think that makes you different

305
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,400
than some other donors too in some ways. Oh probably. A lot of people give money

306
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:48,559
and then they look to done. You know they don't pay attention. But I really like to know what they're

307
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:59,039
doing with it. Absolutely. The one big organization that you've given to is OSU. We haven't talked

308
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,920
about that at all. But I'd love to hear more about your involvement there and all the things that

309
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,199
you've contributed. I know a lot of it has been real estate fundraising for various real estate

310
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:20,319
ventures. Oh is that true? Well I think that when you know a lot of all of this stuff that goes

311
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:33,599
on is who you know. And I'm really proud of the fact that there were three ships available

312
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:43,279
or fishing vessels I should say available in Newport. And I had been cut, become very friendly

313
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:52,719
with Bruce made in his wife Mary-Due and his mother because they wanted me to go on a trip

314
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:01,199
and his mother needed a roommate. So I said well I would go and room with her. Well we just got

315
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:10,960
along fine and we just became really good friends over Newport. So anyway the more I heard about

316
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,879
what Bruce made was doing I was very impressed with what he does and his science that he's

317
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:30,000
promoted with whales. So anyway there were some when the fishing industry over there we kind of

318
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,320
went kaput by the were three men who wanted to donate their boats to as you for research.

319
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:47,519
Well the trustees who were the people who say yes or no there's a little you know board

320
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:55,039
that does that. They didn't know what did they do about Bruce made and never heard of him didn't

321
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:01,759
know anything about him. Well I had followed him because he's on BBC and he's on

322
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:12,639
history channels and all of those things and he was doing great things about tagging whales so that

323
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:23,039
they knew where they were going and what they were doing. And so John Irving was one of the men who

324
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:32,239
was trying to get the board the boys you board to accept these these ships because he thought it was a

325
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:41,759
great thing for them to be able to re retrofit them and get them fixed for research. Well so far

326
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:48,719
they've only done one but they're available but anyway backing up he called me one day and he

327
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:57,359
said would I be willing to speak to the trustees about Bruce made and I said oh I'd love to because

328
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:05,519
I really think he does a good job. So anyway I told him I said how many of you know Bruce the name

329
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:13,519
Bruce made. They looked at each other. So I proceeded to tell him who he was and what he'd done and

330
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:21,519
what wonderful research he was doing. So then they were all skittery ship out insurance on these

331
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,719
boats but they finally worked it out with I don't know who but anyway they accepted the three boats

332
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,159
and I'm really proud of the fact that I kind of encouraged him to do so. So Lutley yeah.

333
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,759
But you know sometimes it's just who you know. That's right and having that personal touch.

334
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,760
I'm willing to be there and say yeah I know of this man and I can speak for him. That's right.

335
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,600
And I can tell him a little bit about what he does. His mother I don't know whether you want to put

336
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,320
anything about this in but I think she's such a tear woman. She's just a little short thing.

337
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:09,200
She's probably not five feet tall. She studied under Frank Lloyd Wright and his registered architect.

338
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:22,319
She studied a library of science and as a degree in whatever library is and she's this one smart lady.

339
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:29,519
She's just a there and has a wonderful sense of humor. Just enjoyed her knowing.

340
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:38,719
Oh, that's great. Unfortunately now she's in a rest home in Newport but doesn't have her mind

341
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,280
very clear right now but she's getting older with some of the rest of us.

342
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,559
So you've done some work as a lot of work through the foundation as well through the OSU foundation?

343
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:04,079
Well I'm on the OSU foundation. I wouldn't say I do much work but I go and I see. So that's more of being a member

344
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,880
of the board and not necessarily anything. Things that you're most proud of.

345
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:17,039
No, in fact I'm not very proud of what they're doing right now. We won't put that in.

346
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:22,960
We won't. Okay. All right. You say so. Are there things that OSU that you look at and think I don't

347
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,599
I'm so pleased beyond the both that you that you got for Bruce's project but are there other things there

348
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,800
that you look at and think I'm so glad to have been a contributor to this. Well the library of course

349
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,440
I think our library is just one of the nicest ones in the Northwest. It's amazing.

350
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,159
And I'm very supportive of Carol Butcher. I think she does some very innovative things.

351
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:54,319
The most recent one that she's done is having that babysitting area that she has and the students

352
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,679
can come and bring if they're studying in the library they have to stay in the library but if

353
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,639
they're studying they can bring their children and let them off at this little care center.

354
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:10,559
And they they're given a thing like you get in restaurants you know when you're

355
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:18,880
beeper. So kind of a beeper? Yes a beeper and so if they need them they can be the mother

356
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:27,759
and our father was a case maybe these days and and I think that's quite innovative. I didn't know

357
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:36,559
about that. Yes it's quite a nice project. They have a little they they've done some interesting

358
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:42,799
things with the plumbing because of course they needed to toilet and it's a little really nice

359
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:54,159
little porta potting and so they didn't put in actual plumbing but I think it's very well designed

360
00:48:54,159 --> 00:49:02,000
and they have students in there that are learning childcare. I think it's just a great project.

361
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:11,599
Oh I'll have to check that out. Terrific. Well and you're such a beaver fan. Oh yes I'm a beaver.

362
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:19,599
That should definitely be in there too I think. Well you know since I've lived in Kervellis all my

363
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:26,400
life there's no and you know I had three out of my four children go through Oregon State so

364
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,840
where and my husband was a graduate of Oregon State and and I've worked for the college through

365
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,800
the extension service and you know we've just been involved in the university all our lives. Sure

366
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,840
yeah and of course my father worked at the university and you know you're just kind of all

367
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,840
that's where your life has been. That's right yeah but I love I love the fact that you still go to

368
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,760
the football games. Oh yes oh yes oh that football game Saturday night was something.

369
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,000
It's like that they're doing so well this year. He was just so proud. But although he officiating was

370
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:13,120
aww. Was it cool? He was just terrible. Huh. And even Mike Riley who calls the games for the radio

371
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,039
he said it was the worst officiating he'd ever seen in my life. That's a statement. Yes.

372
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:30,159
And the the paper I think Riley asked him to downplay it probably but he's a very low key guy

373
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:37,840
but boy was he upset to see officiating he called one of the plays you know and asked him to read

374
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:48,239
read through it. Really? And they and they they did change it. So yeah it was a it was a feisty game.

375
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:54,719
Good. You're good. And you still go to those with your family? Yes. In fact I did go with my daughter

376
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:03,279
and son-in-law this time. I always sometimes I use tickets for guests. I like to entertain that way.

377
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:10,719
You know because I have the tickets I might as well use them for something. That's right.

378
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:19,439
Well that's your your support of the sports angle of the OSU in general it seems like that's

379
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:26,959
a particular emphasis for you. Yes and I like I really like basketball better. I go to all the

380
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:35,039
basketball games. You're not doing very well on basketball this year but of course when Ralph Miller

381
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:47,679
was there why it was just wonderful. Well that's good. So are there any other projects that you think

382
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,039
you'd like to talk about in here things that you're particularly proud of?

383
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,039
Well I guess I'm particularly proud of my kids. Well that's it I would love to get back to that

384
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:07,199
because we sort of talked about their younger life when we were here a couple weeks ago but I'd

385
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:13,440
like to hear about about them today and what you what you're most proud of of each of them.

386
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:25,039
Well Ken's the oldest and he lives in Southern California and he has two sons and the grandchildren

387
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:36,639
are doing most most welcome. Derek is the his oldest son and he's married to Mindy and they

388
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:48,000
have three children now and they're cheesy. What do they call that school? Modestory school teacher

389
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:58,159
and has a school in their home and Derek is very handy and he's made a dollhouse and he's made

390
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:04,239
slides and he's made they have half their yard for the school and half the yard for their

391
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,719
own private and the kids know when they come that they don't go on that side of the yard

392
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:20,639
but they just do a whale of a job they're growing up to be such fine young people.

393
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:31,839
That's wonderful and I'm very proud of them and my kin lives in I don't know what Ken does and I

394
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:41,199
he's on the California Water Board he does something about that he's also done something with

395
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:48,559
hazardous waste he's been on committees about that. Is he an engineer? No he really isn't he's

396
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:57,439
he was a business major he started out as being a forest major but he every time he went to class

397
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:07,279
he I've failed trip he had poison oak and so he had to give that up and so he was a business major

398
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,320
and then he got his NBA and

399
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,160
something but um

400
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:28,960
but he's he's dabbled in a lot of things and he lives in on 10 acres in an avocado grove and raises

401
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,720
those great big avocados. Oh yes those are great.

402
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:43,679
Oh that's so good and and um and his wife is a psychologist and the children all call her the

403
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:52,559
shrink. That's great and their second son and the second one it was in the military. What's his name?

404
00:54:53,759 --> 00:55:01,599
Danny. Danny, huh? And he was in the military for about 10 years I think and married a really nice

405
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:11,440
girl and they have two children and he's out of the military now and taking auto mechanics and

406
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,880
well I guess you'd say mechanics because I think it's a combination of auto and airplane

407
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:30,159
the mechanics he likes to work with his hands so he does that then crags the next boy

408
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:42,000
and he um is uh lives in bend and um he does um well I don't know what Craig does

409
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:54,239
he runs some sort of a business called bad checks and it's he takes checks that are bouncing

410
00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:00,799
and does something with him and I've never been able to figure out what he does but anyway he does

411
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:11,039
that and then he um he's a hunter and a fisherman and um seems to earn enough money to play

412
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:20,879
quite a bit and he also has some friends who are quite wealthy and he goes with them a lot because

413
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:32,240
Craig's a fun guy um and um he has told him as well? Yes he has too and what is going to school here

414
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:40,240
in at LBCC and is going to be she's studying to be a

415
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:50,799
um now I don't know what she's studying to be anyway she's going to school

416
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:57,439
uh huh what's her name? Tracy Tracy and then Mackenzie goes to

417
00:56:58,399 --> 00:57:08,319
scad which is Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah Georgia and she's studying jewelry

418
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:17,600
and she apparently is very good because uh she just designed some piece that the teacher is

419
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:25,440
taking to Hong Kong to show since some group that are over there and I guess it's quite a

420
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:36,400
thing in her body. She um has been thinking that she would like to buy a Savannah house you know

421
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:44,000
an antique house of some sort and have a store below what you restore below and have a live above

422
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:55,119
so she's got her little life all figured out. Then there's Kathy who lives in Portland KATH Y

423
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:04,800
and um she's married to um meet Clifford and um and which is kind of interesting because you know

424
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:12,720
we have a man over here who was Clifford Mead and the uh in the uh uh

425
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:23,760
Alinas Paul and Insta-Jay to the University. So anyway um you gotta be careful with which way you get that

426
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:39,200
um uh and he um was a man who uh man um he called it uh uh what did he call that business

427
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:47,120
anyway it was storing hospital records and he built that up to a very big business

428
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:55,839
and then all of a sudden Iron Mountain came in and uh they were an international company and

429
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:04,719
they bought him out so he does some other things now. Did they have children? Yes they have three

430
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:15,759
and it's um the oldest one is Brent and he goes to school at oh I can't tell you it's it's a

431
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:26,480
one of the California schools it's San Diego. It's the Catholic school that's in San Diego up on the

432
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:36,480
hill. I can bet it. Very prestigious school but I never know whether it's the university uh no

433
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,440
I don't think it's got university in it because it's a private it's a Catholic school they are

434
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:49,200
Catholic but he wanted to go to someplace where he could wear flip-flops and shorts. He found it.

435
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,119
So he's and he's I'm going to graduate this year and he thinks he's going to go to law school.

436
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:04,559
Great and then Colin is the high school senior I don't know what I'm going to do about

437
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:12,639
graduation this year. We've got all these kids graduating. Mackenzie will graduate from SCAD.

438
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,079
Brent's going to graduate from California. Colin's going to graduate from Lincoln High School

439
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,920
and you know how do I want to be able to go? You'll have to map it out with a calendar.

440
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,880
Um that's Colin and he goes to Lincoln High School. What's his interest you know?

441
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:43,360
Um well the poor kid he's had health problems and he wants to be an athlete but he

442
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:53,200
just had his tonsils out and it was a real brutal operation. He was in the hospital for two or

443
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:59,439
three days with tonsils. Yeah he don't hear about that much anymore. They say that when you're older

444
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:07,199
and you have your tonsils out it's real rough and it was he just had a few days there of

445
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:19,279
being miserable. So I don't know what Colin will be interested in. He's looking at schools now

446
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:29,519
and then there's little Brent who is interested in nothing but LaCrosse. Now you said Brent was

447
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:38,320
the oldest? Yes. Then Colin and then Brent. No Brent? I see I got two Brent somehow. Oh who is the old?

448
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Oh I'm sorry. Okay. Grant is what I meant. Grant is the oldest. Okay Colin and then

449
01:01:50,080 --> 01:02:00,880
Brent. Alright. And Grant's LaCrosse. Well that's his, the sleep eats everything LaCrosse and I

450
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:07,519
guess he's a pretty good little player because he was chosen as one of two in the Portland district

451
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:14,960
to represent the teams that play. He's played in Philadelphia and this is a middle school.

452
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,000
Huh? Oh he's still in middle school. That's amazing. And he played in Philadelphia and he played

453
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,840
in Seattle and he played in Southern California and you understand that. I think that's too much

454
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:33,199
for middle school kids. Oh yeah but that's what they do these days. Oh yes it sure is and I guess

455
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:43,279
he's pretty darn good. So that's his passion. And then there's Kim. She's the baby and she's

456
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:51,279
married to Walt and she and Walt are now doing the courtyard. You know what I mean about the courtyard.

457
01:02:51,279 --> 01:03:02,399
Yeah. And that's Revivalence. Revivalence. Like they call it and they've been working really hard

458
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,519
to get the students to get it fixed up so that students can live there. It was in terrible shape.

459
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:18,720
And they've got 14 students living there. And they're the nicest young people.

460
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:27,760
They have to be kind of religiously oriented. Not any particular denomination.

461
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:36,720
Just and they're all enthusiastic about where they live and they're spreading the word and

462
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:43,280
Kim said by next year they'll have a waiting list. I'm sure. Yeah. So are they living here in

463
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,080
town while they work here? Yes they live out at the end of 29th street. Oh great. Clear up in the

464
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,880
hills. Because otherwise did she live in Portland before? Yes. Uh huh. Has she moved completely

465
01:03:52,880 --> 01:04:01,680
down here? Uh and yes. Walt's been an interesting husband. He's he ran and he was an FFA boy.

466
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:10,720
And he when he finished college he had six screenhouses and ran a nursery.

467
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:21,039
Took up to a cardiculture in college. But he's gone through all the work for a rubber company

468
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:31,119
and he worked for, he's always landed on his feet with a very good job. But now they're deciding

469
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:39,759
that they'll do this. So who knows what they'll do. And she was a teacher? Yes. Uh huh.

470
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:46,159
Now she was trained as a teacher. She's not doing that anymore? No. She's working with Walt.

471
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:54,000
Revolves. Okay. She was substituting when they lived in Portland. Uh huh. Great. And they have twin

472
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:04,000
daughters. Uh huh. Jennifer and Kristen. Uh huh. And Kristen is, um, she graduated from

473
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:20,880
Seattle Pacific. And in business and has a job in Portland with a computer company that she

474
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:32,320
hates her job but gets good money. And Jennifer has graduated in home economics. We're

475
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:40,080
helping human science. Uh huh. And uh has a job in Portland that she just loves but doesn't make much

476
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:48,800
money. So often it's a trade off. But it's fun that she's continuing on in the home economics field.

477
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:56,640
Well no she manages an office for some brokers. Oh she does. She has her degree but she doesn't use it.

478
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:03,759
Oh. Oh. Well still she has the same interest that you did in home economics. It's nice that you

479
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:10,559
share that. Well yes. Uh huh. She she did and she worked a lot in kid spirit when she was here.

480
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:20,239
And school she worked at kid spirit almost all the time she was here. So um it's wonderful that

481
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:24,639
you can even name all these grandchildren and talk about each of them individually. Did you

482
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,679
spend a lot of time with them when they were growing up? Well more so with Kim's children than

483
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:37,039
the rest of them because they were in Portland. And um well I spent time with with Kathy's children when

484
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:44,879
they were younger but I don't drive to Portland anymore so I don't see them nearly as often as I

485
01:06:44,879 --> 01:06:50,559
use to. Uh huh. But I know they stay in touch just from the fact that last time I was here one of

486
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:56,799
somebody called maybe one of your California grandchildren. Oh. Oh yeah they all call. We were

487
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:05,039
wonder we think cell phones are just great. That's good. Yeah. What were some of the things that

488
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:13,279
you did with them when you could get to spend time with them? Well we we shopped a lot and uh

489
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,960
they're they're they love to shop with grandma because you know who's buy some stuff. Oh my

490
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:29,679
guess at the same. But we we did a lot of things together. We had a lot of picnics together.

491
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:39,599
Did you ever share your cooking and sewing in those kind of skills with them? Well not much maybe

492
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:47,440
maybe naked sugar cookies. They all like my sugar cookies. And this this holiday I'm taking the

493
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:56,159
rolls and the sugar cookies for my part of the Thanksgiving dinner. Oh that's good. And last night

494
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:02,960
Craig said I said something about boy who had taken me a long time to make rolls. I said I just

495
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:09,679
got as fast as I used to be. And he said well don't worry about the rolls just bring the sugar

496
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:17,439
cookies. Got priorities that's a good thing. So that's kind of the thing that I'm noted for.

497
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,279
Did you have that experience of just finding out how much fun it was to be a grandparent

498
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,159
as with you know enjoying your time with them and not having quite as much of the work as you do

499
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:38,559
when you're a parent. Well I loved to when Kim had her twins because she lived in Lebanon at that time.

500
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:52,240
And Walt was still doing the nursery. And so when she and Walt were married she had another year

501
01:08:52,240 --> 01:09:01,360
to go in school. She was married when she was a junior and Walt was a senior. But her daddy had

502
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:06,000
said I don't mind you getting married but he said you're going to finish school.

503
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:13,600
Well of course what happened was that she got pregnant. And then they found out they were having

504
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:22,640
twins. And of course in the meantime he died. And so anyway I said you know you promised your daddy

505
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:32,880
that if you got married and she said I know. So anyway I said my advice to you is to kept busy

506
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:41,039
and she only had her doom teaching to do. And I said you need to do that before your kids get

507
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:46,000
mobile. I said it's a lot easier to take care of them when they're in the in the

508
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:55,840
not wandering around. And Walt was home during the day because he was running the nursery.

509
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:04,560
So there was an emergency he was there so that worked out well. So anyway Kim was able to get a

510
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:13,920
student teaching situation in Lebanon. So she wasn't far away and so she finished up and got

511
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:24,079
her degree while she was doing that. And then but I was over there a lot taking care of the youngsters

512
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:33,600
and they'd have full time help but it was you know I like to go over there and help feed the kids.

513
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,920
I can imagine. She was a great mother. She twins didn't bother Kim at all. I can still see her

514
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,559
sitting on the dab important one. Baby would be laying over there and she'd be feeding this one

515
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:52,000
and that one would be yelling and she'd pat him on the back and say now it's your turn next.

516
01:10:54,559 --> 01:11:04,559
Good for her. She was a wonderful mother. Great. So the last time when I was here and you got

517
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:11,519
that phone call you were going to be sending down one of your boys jackets to one of your great

518
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:19,520
grand. Yes. Yes and I did that and he's absolutely ecstatic. That is so sweet. Yeah this would

519
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:27,680
be born to actually this one was a red, plantable boy scout jacket. I don't know whether you know but

520
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:35,840
that's quite a deal when they get that. And then they put all their patches on it. And so this one

521
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:42,640
was all covered in patches and so I said to Ken my son I said what do you think I ought to do

522
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:48,239
with these patches and he said well I take them off because he needs to earn his own patches.

523
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:58,960
So anyway I've got them all in a little Ziploc bag and I'm taking them over to Craig who earned

524
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:10,000
the patches and then sent the coat to the cleaners and it's been sent down to yeah to what's his name?

525
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,760
One of those guys down there. Get the name of the great grandchildren I guess.

526
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:25,920
Derek Rodinney's kids huh? Yeah well it's Derek's kids. Well anyway whoever's getting it

527
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:35,760
and he said so Ken called me and he said boy is he one happy boy? He said he's just crazy about

528
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,119
and you know what looked brand new when it got back from the cleaners it was just great. That's

529
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:48,319
fun. They kind of fluffed up all of the sewing that would have been on it worked out just really well.

530
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:53,039
That's good. Good. Well are there other things that you have that you saved from when you were

531
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,359
a little girl that you have been able to pass on to your grandchildren that they've enjoyed?

532
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,600
Well I don't really think of anything off-hand.

533
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:15,519
Oh no I don't. The only thing that I have saved really of Kathie's is that she made a dress with

534
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:28,240
beautiful satin stitch. I could show that to you. I think it's a real special little dress and

535
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,760
it's been hanging back there for 20 hairs just because I enjoy looking at it.

536
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,240
Uh huh. Do you want to see it? I'd love to. Well let's wait till we're done. We'll go out. We'll

537
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,800
go down there at the end unless you need to get up and stretch a little bit. No no no. I'm

538
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:48,000
sitting for a while. We're doing here for time. Let's see. Two thirds. We plan to stop at three again.

539
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,720
It's two. It's 20 minutes to three now. How to be fine. Okay. All right. Let's see.

540
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,360
And then we're just about three four. We are. I think this will be our last formal get together.

541
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh huh. I want to keep open the possibility of giving you a call while I'm putting this together.

542
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,480
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

543
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:13,199
My understanding. So I had some more sort of general questions that are more or less

544
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,719
reflections on life and you could tell me if you're comfortable answering these kinds of things.

545
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,879
But I like to have a little bit of people's philosophy in these books too.

546
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:29,519
Because I feel like what you're leaving with this book is a statement of your legacy.

547
01:14:29,519 --> 01:14:34,000
One other's there's so much about your death legacy out there. And I think well

548
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,520
Jean has a legacy of her own that she's leaving. She's leaving here.

549
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:47,199
Do you have a sense of what you want your legacy to be? What do you think your children and your

550
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:53,439
community should remember about you? Oh gosh. Those are hard things to answer.

551
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:03,439
I should have given you these questions in advance. Yeah. Because I just hope that people

552
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:12,399
remember that I've tried to live by the golden rule. I guess it's my philosophy.

553
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:21,839
I'd like to have people treat me like I want to be treated and I want to treat them.

554
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:32,400
And I've always kind of lived by that hopefully by that philosophy that

555
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:46,319
I don't know really what else to say about that. I want to feel like I'm

556
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,920
all I'm on this earth that I'm contributing something to society.

557
01:15:53,359 --> 01:16:04,000
And I guess that that's why I like to get out and do things and I don't want to just sit.

558
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Right. Do you stay active? And we haven't talked about knitting either, have we?

559
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,960
I'd like to hear more. That's one of my hobbies.

560
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,520
You've shown me and you actually told me that you got started on that back when you were

561
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:23,119
in high school when you were waiting for your dad to pick you up. This piece is coming along nicely

562
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,520
though. Are you getting close to the end of it? Yes, I'm getting quite close to the end of it.

563
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,760
Just love the colors that you chose for that. This is for Colin.

564
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,359
And I've made a knitting. I'm not the end there. Oh, do I?

565
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:38,960
I'm losing something. Not quite.

566
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:48,880
I've hit an African for each one of the children. Most of them, at least the ones that have asked for it.

567
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:58,799
Uh-huh. And so he's a big boy and so he wanted something heavy and his mother wanted something

568
01:16:58,799 --> 01:17:04,399
that he wouldn't put his toes through. Good point. Uh-huh. And so that's for that.

569
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,479
But this one is, and you know, we might take a picture of that one time.

570
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,839
Because I'm most proud of this African.

571
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:22,000
I think this is the one that I didn't know I was waiting for him when he was a football player.

572
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:25,679
I've been most of this under a street light.

573
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:31,119
Waiting in your car while he was at practice? Yes. It's gorgeous.

574
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,760
And I've got a variety of stitches in this one. So I'm really pleased with this one.

575
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,319
Now how did you end up with that if you knitted it for him?

576
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,599
Oh, I didn't knit it for him. I'll just knit it for you.

577
01:17:43,599 --> 01:17:49,279
Wow, he was. He was playing. I did it for myself.

578
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:54,079
It's just gorgeous. Well, I'm at least a sampler, isn't it, with all the,

579
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:56,159
yes, it is. It's kind of stitching in it.

580
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:04,000
But I've knit, I don't know how many of these. I knit one for Uncle Norm. That was my,

581
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:13,680
my husband's brother. And he, I had a real hard time. They were, when he was getting older,

582
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:22,159
they just kind of chopped him in pieces. He lost a leg and, you know, an arm and

583
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:31,760
diabetes? No, I don't know what he had. So long time ago, and I forgot what he had, but anyway,

584
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:39,760
he needed to blank it to keep warm. He didn't have very good circulation. So I knit him one,

585
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:46,399
and I get, I don't know how many askings I've made. I might take a picture of that one too before

586
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:51,039
I leave here. I'd love to have a picture of that to put in the book as well.

587
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:56,880
Well, I think I'm real proud of this one. Yeah, it's really gorgeous. It's probably the fanciest one

588
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:06,560
that I've got. And I do needle point. That's a needle point one that I did. Which one? That one.

589
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:15,840
The pillow? Beautiful. I love the colors. I have a couple at the beach that I've done in shells,

590
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:25,199
and that sort of thing. I don't have good eyes for that project. Yeah. Tiny little stitches.

591
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,239
I did all of it except the border, and I got to the point where I just couldn't do those fine

592
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:38,720
stitches. It was, it was pink on the background too, and I couldn't see where, where I'd been,

593
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:45,199
and where I was going. Yeah. So who finished it up for you? But Kathy, she does. She does beautiful,

594
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:55,599
needle point. She's, she has inherited more of my clothing and textiles.

595
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:04,000
Ability, yeah. And anybody else. Kim doesn't like to do that much.

596
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:17,119
So you've been a single woman for quite a long time. And I'm sure that has its challenges,

597
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:23,600
but are there parts of that that have been good for you that have helped you to grow?

598
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:33,520
Well, I think Kermit and I never got to travel very much. We did have that one lovely trip to Japan.

599
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,960
That I think we talked about and how we happened to go to Japan and so forth. But when

600
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,760
this Uncle Norm died, my sister-in-law and I traveled quite a bit, we probably went on five or

601
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:59,359
six lovely trips, and we traveled in Europe a lot because my husband never wanted to go to Europe.

602
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:05,839
There was something about the World War II that he just didn't want to go to Europe. But

603
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:17,759
but we did go a lot to other parts of the world. But anyway, Marie and I traveled quite a bit

604
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:28,639
together. And I always enjoyed that. And then when my brother died, I bet he, my sister,

605
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:37,039
and I traveled quite a bit together. So I really enjoyed all of that very much.

606
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,480
So it kind of freed you up to have that kind of experience with other people?

607
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:51,360
Right, right. And I had enough income then to support some travel. So it worked out well.

608
01:21:51,439 --> 01:22:03,920
Yeah. When you're traveling, you're sort of seeing the world and seeing however other people live,

609
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,759
are there other parts of that whole traveling thing that really appeal to you?

610
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:16,399
Well, of course Hawaii is my favorite place. Yeah, because it's clean. They speak English.

611
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:24,319
Money is the same. It's easy, huh? Yeah, it's easy. And of course the weather is always good.

612
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:30,479
And I don't remember who did we talk about Betty and I owning a condominium over there?

613
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,639
No, although I saw that somewhere else and I meant to ask you about that. So you have a condominium

614
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:40,799
together? We did. Well, you don't have it anymore? No, well, of course she's gone. She's been gone for

615
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:53,520
several years. But we were, she had Alzheimer's. And when we decided that we wanted to do this

616
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,840
condominium together, we said that we were just going to let the family use it.

617
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:07,920
Well, all of a sudden I began to hear people were thanking me for going to here, stay in my condominium.

618
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:18,880
Well, I thought that she was being a little bit presumptuous, but it turned out that she really

619
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:27,600
had not remembered that we had this understanding. And so anyway, I said that I didn't give her any

620
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,000
reason why, but I just said that I thought that maybe I wasn't going to be interested in having

621
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,680
the condominium anymore. And she said, well, she'd buy me out. So it was all very name-in-born

622
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:49,279
everything. And then I realized a few years later that she just really wasn't herself. So it was okay.

623
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:56,560
And my nephews just couldn't be nicer to me. They're just wonderful boys. That's great.

624
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,520
So when you were in Hawaii, did you do that? You said,

625
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,880
Kermit was a scuba diver early on. Were you a scuba diver as well?

626
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:10,800
Yes. He taught me how to scuba dive. And we always went snorkeling.

627
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:28,560
I wasn't comfortable going by myself too much. And so he would always take my hand and

628
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:42,720
go out together and look and then he'd say, but Betty and I did a lot of that too because she liked

629
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:51,600
to snorkel. So when we had our condominium, we would go snorkeling almost every day.

630
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,640
Oh, that sounds wonderful. How long did you have it together?

631
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:02,640
About three years. That's great. Good. And I think most of the kids had it once or twice.

632
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,480
They all went over once or twice. They were at the age where they didn't have a lot of extra

633
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:17,039
money for the fare over and then along the staying. And so they could manage it every once in a while,

634
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:22,800
but not too often. Yeah. That sounds like a real treat. And you had taken them over quite a bit

635
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,400
when they were younger. Yes. We'd always gone over on spring break. That's fun.

636
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,880
You know one thing we didn't talk about. I know that Kermit was involved in the church and you've

637
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,840
always been involved with the church as well. Do you consider yourself a spiritual person?

638
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:57,279
Well, I think I am more... I think I'm not a... I don't talk about religion too much.

639
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:06,239
My daughter and son-in-law Kim and Walter are very religious in me. They talk about it all the time

640
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:15,760
and they pray before heels and that sort of thing. I'm more of a one who keeps their religion

641
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:30,559
kind of to themselves. And my husband... I think I've got a lot of his feelings in me because he

642
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:41,680
always said that if he dealt with some businessman who broadcast his religion and had visible

643
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:51,200
things on his desk that portrayed his religion, it just raised a red flag with him because he

644
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:59,280
said, I know too many men who go to church every Sunday and just pull back by you during the week.

645
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:10,719
And I think I've inherited a lot of that feeling. I try to live by the golden rule as I say.

646
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,960
All right, well we have just about five more minutes and I think I can

647
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:23,920
limit us to maybe three questions. Okay, in that time the other sort of big picture issue I wanted

648
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:29,840
to ask you about whether there were any sort of social or political issues that have been

649
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,880
important to you as you've come through your life. Are there any things that have been...

650
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:49,199
Well, I'm a firm believer that you should... What is it about the babies? I think it should

651
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,000
between your husband and your doctor and yourself. And I'm really

652
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,840
myth that people can't see that, that it's none of the government's business.

653
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,279
It's your pro choice. Yeah, I'm sure am.

654
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:11,599
And have you ever been active in any of those kind of causes or have just a personally held

655
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:19,039
belief? I'm not in a cause person. That's good. You've been active in

656
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:28,479
causes sort of in the back. By your influence, yeah. And I guess the other thing is that in church too,

657
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:40,079
that I feel that if you want to be a... What are you when you're lesbian, I guess?

658
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:50,640
You know, the congregational church is a big on people being lesbians. And I had to give up

659
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,519
the congregational church even though with my background is in the congregational church. But

660
01:28:57,519 --> 01:29:07,119
it's also in the Presbyterian church. But I'm a Presbyterian now because I could... They hired a lady.

661
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,680
I don't know the remember this, but probably 10, maybe 15 years ago,

662
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:19,279
a lady came and was part of the Presbyterian church. And I think she was the

663
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:27,760
Sunday school teacher that they hired the young people. And she thought that lesbians were just

664
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:35,599
the best thing that ever happened to anybody. And she would have... When she first came,

665
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:43,440
there was a picture of her in the paper almost every week about what she believed in. And I thought,

666
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:54,160
I am just sick of that. And so the minister came to see me and I said, do you advertise what goes

667
01:29:54,160 --> 01:30:01,360
on in your bedroom? Well, no. And I said, well, I don't know why lesbians have to advertise that

668
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:10,479
that persuasion. And so I said, I'm just not going to support the church until you change your

669
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:19,199
rules. And so that's... You've moved on from there now. Yeah. Yeah. And it was more a matter of

670
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:27,599
the... How public she was being about it. Yes, yes. I don't care. The whole Mac teachers over here

671
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:35,520
have always lived together. But they haven't advertised what... And a lot of them were just doing it

672
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:44,320
because they needed friendship. And there's nothing wrong with that. But to advertise,

673
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:52,640
you know, how you feel about your personal, it just calls me. And I don't mind if you print that.

674
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,880
All right. That's an important stance. I think that's good.

675
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:07,760
If you had to pinpoint what you're grateful for in this life, you've talked so much about your

676
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,480
family and things like that. Are there particular things that you think about how grateful you are to

677
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:20,880
have had in your life? Yes, I think I'm grateful for the fact that I've had a good education.

678
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:30,400
And that I have been able to use it in many different ways. And that I've been able to contribute

679
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:43,680
to society. Yes. And that I've been able to earn enough money to live comfortably.

680
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:56,240
And to share what you have. Yes. Are there... Is there anything that feels sort of unfinished

681
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:02,159
about your life at this point? Are there things that you still have left to do or that you feel like

682
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:12,480
you would like to do better? Well... No, I don't really think there's any unfinished business.

683
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:23,760
Well, I don't know that I had any great broad plans to do anything. It kind of all just sort of evolved.

684
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:32,480
That's life. I don't think I had any grand notions of what I could accomplish or anything.

685
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:39,440
It was just that when the opportunity came and I could see that I could help a little bit,

686
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:46,399
but I took advantage of that. But it wasn't anything premeditated.

687
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:57,519
Do you have any advice on thinking about your grandchildren and great grandchildren reading this

688
01:32:57,519 --> 01:33:04,639
and wondering if there is anything that you would suggest to them as in terms of kind of an overall

689
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:12,880
way to live your life? Well, I think the main thing is that you need to be fair and you need to be honest

690
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,320
and you need to take advantage of opportunities that are presented themselves.

691
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:31,760
And I just think that it's important that you be happy.
