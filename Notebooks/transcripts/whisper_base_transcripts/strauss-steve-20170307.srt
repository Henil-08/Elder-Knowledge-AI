1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Look right into the cameras at the thing to do or what could you or get me.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,400
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Great.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Hmm.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,400
Okay, today is March 7th, 2017, and we were with Stephen Strauss who's a distinguished professor

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,500
of Forests Technology at OSU.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,900
And we will talk to him a fair amount about his career and his time at OSU.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,300
I'd like to begin by building more of a biographical sketch of your life and ask you,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,699
where were you born?

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,500
I was born in Brooklyn, New York.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,199
Is that where you grew up?

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,800
I was there until I was 16.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,799
I left for college at that point and never went back.

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,799
Really?

15
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,799
I went to various schools and places of employment, but not back there since I started college.

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,200
Tell me about the Brooklyn Abuse childhood.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Well, you know, I had a very simple upbringing.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
You know, my parents did not have a lot of money.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,799
And they also, as a fourth child.

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:57,299
And at the time they got to me, they were sort of done being a careful caretaker.

21
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,399
So I really had my one of the streets, as it were, I traveled around New York City

22
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,899
on the subways and buses extensively.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,899
And pretty much called the shots came to one as I wanted.

24
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:10,899
So I was a bit of a feral kid.

25
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,899
So that was fun.

26
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,500
Tell me a bit about your parents and your family.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,900
Yeah, my father was a postal worker, second half of his life,

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,500
and worked evenings and enjoyed his job.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
A great deal and had a great network of friends.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,299
And I think he enjoyed being there, then more than enjoyed being home with the kids and with my mom.

31
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:38,799
My mom was a hard worker, but she was set up overwhelmed, I think, by the depression and raising two kids.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,000
And was sort of mentally run out, let's say, with the time she got to me.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,900
So, you know, very humble, simple upbringing.

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,900
You know, my parents had good values and still didn't meet, you know, ten times over the value of getting an education

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,500
and making yourself better and helped me all along the way once they realized I had good academic potential.

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,900
They kept finding money that I didn't think they had to keep my academic career going.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:13,900
So solid upbringing, but also not a great deal of mentoring, advice, and you know, any of the things that I hope I've given to my kids,

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
having a better situation.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Can you tell me a bit more about community life and the specific neighborhood that you were in?

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
What neighborhood was that?

41
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,400
It was a neighborhood called Barrow Park in New York.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:39,900
It was split roughly 50-50 between quite religious Jews, many of them, chasic, and you know, dressed in all the garb and refusing to associate really with what you might call mainstream society.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,400
And then Italians, and many of those were Sicilians who were first or one and a half generations off the boat.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,400
And they were rough and tough and tumble and hated Jews as much as the Jews hated them.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:02,400
And I grew up with most of my friends who I had a secular type of life, my parents were Jewish, but very reformed.

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Nothing like the Chacetic Jews, but I was something of an in-betweener where I played with these kids.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I was out in the street playing stick ball and football and, you know, just with Italian friends who didn't know what to make of me.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Because they were taught to hate Jews and I was a Jew, but not really a Jew because I wasn't like those guys.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
And so it was a strange upbringing in that regard.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
But some of these Italian friends are still very close to me, even at the stage of my life.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,400
And so it was, you know, as they were struggling with, many of them were getting brutalized at home.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, that was normal for this Sicilian culture that came from.

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
They came in five minutes late and they were getting beaten.

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
And I had a very different kind of upbringing.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:55,400
So it was quite amazing to see that, see the Cittab Jews, see my in-betweener kind of growing up and figuring it out from there.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
What were you interested in as you were before growing up?

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, you know, I was interested in sports. I was just a very active sporty kid.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I still run. I referee soccer. I still, you know, I follow some of the OSU teams.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I was still a sporty guy. So these Italians were very athletic.

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
And so that was a real connection.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,399
And then probably the big change was, you know, it was a gut to teenage years.

62
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:27,399
And I started, I met friends who were somewhat politically active in protesting being on board.

63
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:33,399
Being interested in recreational marijuana and things that were very common in the generation back then.

64
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,399
I really, I moved away from these Italian kids and moved further away after my bar mitzvah.

65
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,399
I did get that done because I felt like the family needed me to do that.

66
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:50,399
And then I moved away from Judaism, moved away from these Italian more rough elements and found a group of friends that were more intelligent.

67
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:57,399
They were a mix of Jews and Gentiles, but more, you would say, progressive or left leaning.

68
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:05,399
And grew my hair along. I had beads in junior high school. I remember that started and became, you know, fairly politically active,

69
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,399
went to a bunch of demonstrations as a high schooler and then into college.

70
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,399
At what point did science became, kind of something was important to you?

71
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,399
Yeah, you know, I had, I went to a high school in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Tech.

72
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,399
So New York City, there's three selective public high schools.

73
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,399
Brooklyn Tech is one of the three where there's an entrance exam.

74
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,399
And it was, it's really a place for training engineers.

75
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,399
And in the old school engineers were people who just shut up and calculated.

76
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:42,399
And the teaching of science was rough. I mean, for people who were gifted and mathematics, I guess it was okay.

77
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,399
But I was completely turned off to science. I wanted no part of it.

78
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:54,399
All the teachers, the whole education system was the opposite of my somewhat progressive interests.

79
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:01,399
So when I, so I graduated, I did take the engineering classes I had to at Brooklyn Tech and did fine.

80
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:09,399
And then when I got to college, I went to the State University of New York and purchased, which was sort of an alternative arm of the State University system in New York.

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:22,399
And then I did now grades at all kinds of experimental teaching systems, I'm Asian philosophy for a year, or just trying to figure out what I was interested in and so forth.

82
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,399
And really, because I was interested in the environment and with the State of the world.

83
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,399
And I didn't see how a degree in philosophy was going to really help me do that.

84
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,399
And I was concerned about my economic disability to survive.

85
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,399
And I switched to biology at that point, interested in the environment and some kind of a job.

86
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:48,399
And then I got into the science track. I was also, I had skipped a grade in middle school, junior high school, as we called it.

87
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,399
I was born at the end of the year. So I was almost two years immature compared to a lot of my peers.

88
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,399
And I was really confused in college. So I was going through these transitions, philosophy, environment, science, and just.

89
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:07,399
And using a lot of marijuana and other things. And I was just, so finally I said, time out, I took a year off.

90
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:16,399
And that was a really smart thing to do. And worked, saved money, did some great travel and went to Alaska, and with friends and other things.

91
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:25,399
And then when I went back, I was able to transfer to Cornell and become a serious science student in Cornell. Very, very rigorous.

92
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,399
And so really from then till now, I've just been busted in my ass, if you will.

93
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Trying to keep up with the incredible pace and demands of being a scientist.

94
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:41,399
That's interesting. I was going to ask about how a kid from Brooklyn becomes somebody who spends his career in the forest.

95
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,399
And it sounds like it immerse out of this political impulse.

96
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,399
Political impulse. And along with that, I began to backpacks some with some friends.

97
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:57,399
I didn't know anything about the fires. I remember being very curious. What's this tree? Who knows? What does it do?

98
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:07,399
And so I got curious about it. I love the outdoors. There was an element of use of drugs in there that made me sort of worship in a religious sense.

99
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,399
I had some experience with friends that were just, you know, I still think of this day, these friends of ours.

100
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:21,399
Friends of mine, you know, talk about how magical it was to sort of see the environment, love the environment, be out there, bond.

101
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,399
Try to understand it, try to think about being a caretaker of the environment.

102
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:33,399
And so it was inspirational, is what it was. You know, all that infusion of the youth and the feeling of the need to save the environment.

103
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:41,399
And then with sort of recreational uses and drugs in the comradeship, I just became passionate about it.

104
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:52,399
So it's, I don't want to overemphasize a drug part that accepted it, gave a great sense of joy and sort of sharing that, you know, what happened anyway, but maybe it was more intense.

105
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,399
How did you select Cornell or did Cornell select you?

106
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:08,399
Well, I selected Cornell, you know, with my limited knowledge base growing up in Brooklyn and my parents, you know, working class, and the other one of them had a college education.

107
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:19,399
You know, we always assume the next thing you do is go to Brooklyn College or some very affordable nearby place because you couldn't possibly afford to go to town school at a long Cornell.

108
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:30,399
And my sister was sort of five years ahead of me and she set up a broken, the thinking shackles that, you know, we could do better, that we could reach higher.

109
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:41,399
And she encouraged me to apply and one thing nice about Cornell is very selective, but there's also, it's a hybrid really, between a state-supported university and a private university.

110
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,399
And biology is actually split. I think it still is there.

111
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,399
So if you get into biology and you're a resident of the state of New York, your tuition is about half.

112
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,399
So I made it suddenly affordable whereas it wouldn't have been otherwise.

113
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,399
And then I started getting a bunch of scholarships because I really worked hard and got very good grades.

114
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,399
And then like I said, and when my father realized I was getting a A's at Cornell, who was this kid?

115
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
He started just paying off debts and stuff.

116
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
It sounds like this was an important moment in your life, Cornell.

117
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:23,399
Yeah, it was the start of a whole new person that wasn't this kid in Brooklyn, but was someone who was going somewhere.

118
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,399
And I started working with an ecologist at Cornell.

119
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:37,399
It's also taking all these courses in biology and evolution that blow your mind and suddenly you're thinking about all this big, big stuff and also thinking about saving the world.

120
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,399
And I still never saw myself as a professor or a scientist. I just really unable to do that.

121
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
But I get a degree and then I think, well, a great, I have a bachelor's now.

122
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,399
What do I do with it? In the world of biology, you are a technician for somebody.

123
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,399
And then you think, well, I get a master's and it's really the same thing.

124
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,399
And so it really be a scientist to be somebody who calls the shots, who's thoughts and intellect and ideas or what drives.

125
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,399
What happens? You need to, in science, you need to move on and get a PhD and even beyond.

126
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,399
You need to get a postdoc. So I just never got off the train because I realized I needed to stay on it.

127
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,399
Though I never imagined myself being a scientist with my humble upbringing.

128
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:32,399
So it just kept going. I kept having success. And then from Cornell, I got into the Yale School of Forestry and Environment, which is another not today.

129
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,399
It's much more a breeding ground for environmental activists and policy people.

130
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,399
So it's fully transition. And then I went to Cal Berkeley after that, which is similar.

131
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:56,399
And so I kept getting into these very challenging, very great academic environments that were even more and more environmentally, as well as scientifically, in a players on the world scene.

132
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:06,399
How did you arrive at Forest Sciences? Something you wanted to focus on from biology, I'm guessing biology is sort of an entry to you developing a scientific foundation.

133
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,399
But then you focused your perspective a little bit from there.

134
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:17,399
Yeah, that's a really interesting question. I think it was the fusion of backpacking and being out in the environment.

135
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,399
I also remember when I was, I think, 17, I hitchhiked out from the East Coast to the West Coast.

136
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:33,399
And I was in Oregon just as a long-haired kid by myself. And I remember getting a ride with a logger.

137
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,399
I was up in the Oregon Cascade somewhere near Salem. Not really knowing what I was doing. This was in May.

138
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,399
And I thought I was going to back that to the Pacific Crest for start-back packing it. It was all under snow.

139
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,399
And I just didn't know what I was doing. But I had this conversation with this logger. And I sort of told them about all the things I read from the Sierra Club that helped bad,

140
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:01,399
far far as she was in the Northwest, and how a clear cut is a sin that should never happen. And he just said, now some, let me tell you what we do it.

141
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:09,399
Let me tell you what the safe guards are. And I had no idea how one-sided and biased a perspective I was getting from the Sierra Club.

142
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:19,399
And that issue actually continues to this day as I worked in biotechnology where you have organizations that I trusted as being truthful until I'm telling the whole story.

143
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,399
I'm not even realize, do not. And so that's one of the steps in my evolution from Save the World, simple scientists, I'll save the world.

144
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:34,399
So the real politics and real information society we're in, of course, which has exploded of light with all the fake news and everything.

145
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:45,399
But that's been going on forever to one degree or another, just not a presidential level, quite so blatantly. But anyway, that really opened my eyes. It got me interested. So what is really happening in forestry?

146
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:56,399
And why do you clear a cut? And we can be doing it safely. And can you use intensive technologies of all sorts, conscientiously and responsibly amidst all the noise.

147
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:06,399
And so that's a place that I've continued to work in for 30 years at OSU in the biotech controversy area, related to true use in agriculture in general.

148
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,399
Back to Yale, OK, Fest, and I was surprised to find out that they had a forest science program.

149
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,399
Yeah, yeah. Most people don't know about it. Yeah.

150
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,399
Tell me about that environment for you.

151
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:34,399
Yeah, you know, Yale was a, I went there, I first, because when I was a Cornell and I was interning to undergraduate research with an ecologist, and he was grooming me to go work with his PhD supervisor, brilliant man named Herb Mormon, an ecosystem biologist.

152
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:46,399
And I was all set to go there. And then my graduation was in the later year, because I overlooked a requirement in my advisor. And so I had once a one more year to kind of figure out who I was.

153
00:14:46,399 --> 00:15:02,399
And I took a class in forestry and I just got a little more interested in sort of application and the near term sense. And so when I got to Yale to work to be an ecosystem ecologist and a trained work with Herb, and I did work with Herb Mormon son.

154
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:11,399
But I sort of veer off and became more of a physiologist practitioner as compared to an ecosystem ecologist.

155
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:22,399
But I also discovered that Yale was a place where the number of sort of scientists, particularly the number of practitioner type scientists is very small.

156
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:32,399
I mean, it had really transitioned 60s and 70s into a training ground for environmental activists, environmental lawyers.

157
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:41,399
You know, a lot of people who have populated a lot of international organizations come through places like Yale and Duke, forestry is done a similar thing.

158
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:51,399
And Cal, Berkeley, Forestry is done a similar thing. We're really to survive and be a college in those institutions that are not land grants.

159
00:15:51,399 --> 00:16:03,399
Or if they are there, you know, they're mostly not, I mean, in Berkeley's case, they're kind of a split one. They really had to become really working on big issues of environmental science and a global sense. So they transitioned.

160
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,399
And there's still some science there in all these places, but it's relatively small or it's highly environmental.

161
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:19,399
And so it's, you know, in Oregon State still we have, we have a lot of that too, but we also have a much bigger because we serve, we're in this region with this incredible forestry sector,

162
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,399
whereas New Haven is not in such a region anymore. There's still a little bit of forestry, but very, very little by comparison.

163
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:36,399
And so we here try to serve both, you know, training students to work in the industry, work in the land management agencies very actively,

164
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:46,399
as well as do science and be in the cutting edge of the environmental issues. So anyway, but being at Yale was very much a step into that world, which is a world I wanted to be in my whole life.

165
00:16:46,399 --> 00:17:06,400
But I also realized that I was a little naive maybe in thinking that science had more of the answers. And in reality, I found that science has a lot of answers, but mostly the laws and social perceptions make it difficult to have those answers sort of be used, particularly in genetics, which, you know, we can talk about at some point.

166
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Yeah. What was your research focus at that point?

167
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Yeah. So at Yale, I did two or three projects there were also Yale doesn't have a master's thesis requirement. So I got involved in research projects. I went out to the US Forest Service in California in Berkeley, actually, where they had the Pacific Southwest Station, their work with scientists there.

168
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:42,400
And got my first paper was on the inheritance. So pines have these turquinoids that make them smell sony and the resin that comes down and tries to protect them from bark beetles and so forth. Well, the chemistry of that resin varies widely.

169
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:55,400
And so sometimes you have one chemical, sometimes another, and it's important to the ecology and the organism. So I figured out how it's inherited some scientists before me, Bill Critchfield, a very, very great man, had made these hybrids between different species.

170
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:10,400
And the progeny then had high alpha pining, low alpha pining, and we're seeing all these chemicals. So he said, did this basic meaning work, crossing species with different chemistries, and then you could map the genes in the progeny.

171
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,400
So he basically said, here's the progeny, you want to map the genes. And so I went out and measured them, you know, with help of the scientists, and that was my first paper.

172
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:42,400
And then there are a couple of other small projects like that. So really what it was very much being on the premise and sciences like that a lot where you know people do projects over many years, and then students and postdocs come in and sort of figure it out at value to it, tweak it, and particularly with trees, but you know, science in general, or you know experiments take years to decades.

173
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:56,400
And so I came to the stream of science that the farest science, the farest service scientists were doing in Berkeley, and was able to publish in papers. And that set a set me up for, you know, getting into grad school in Cal and success from there on.

174
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Was that your first exposure to the treated ethics? I mean, it's obviously.

175
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah, really. And I went to Yale, it was not, I told you it was the D.D. ecosystem scientist, and I started working for a geneticist there that put me on a couple of projects.

176
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:20,400
And then he set up this opportunity with a far service in Berkeley, California, named Tom Lettig. He passed away from cancer a couple of years ago, but very, very, very well known internationally.

177
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:36,400
And so he, and he was at Yale, and then he moved to the farest service. And so they set up those opportunities. So I went to Yale, you know, no particular interest in the United States. I was open to it. And then the opportunities, the people.

178
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:50,400
And then I went to Berkeley too, you know, that was partly to work with Tom Lettig, but I still was open to being a physiologist, a silviculturist, managing forests in a larger scale, maybe an ecologist, even of some kind.

179
00:19:50,400 --> 00:20:01,400
And then again, opportunities, the farest service there. Also one other theme in all this is one thing that's frustrating me about ecology, and it still does a lot is it's hard to measure things precisely.

180
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:18,400
You know, it's, it's, and to somebody a lot of scientists, they want to get to the bottom of things. They don't want to have a conclusion that says, well, maybe this can do that, maybe this. We have data, we have models, you know, works this way. And that's just a nature of the beast.

181
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:36,400
And in genetics, you tend to get much closer to hard answers. And that was, that was appealing to me. And then all the genetic technology that was coming along continues to just, you know, my whole career, the field of genetics is exploded five times, was attractive.

182
00:20:36,400 --> 00:21:00,400
You know, first it was enzymes and first was turquinoids and the chemistry thereof and the gas chromatographs. And that was these enzymes you were doing to look at genetic variation in a way that we never did. And then it was DNA and then it was genomics. So doing DNA on massive scale. And then genetic engineering. So it's been this progression of incredibly powerful and intellectually exciting and potentially very important technologies.

183
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:12,400
So that's also pulled me out of ecology. These technologies and I've been using ecology quite a lot, but it's taken a long time to get there. Sounds like it was a fairly seamless transition to Berkeley for you.

184
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Well, yeah, you know, I've been there before and, you know, I knew the place and I loved it. You know, I just loved being in Berkeley. Those five years I was there. It was, you know, it's a great environment for a young person.

185
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:37,400
It's definitely a very artificial environment. And the reason I say that as I one of my memories from there is I think the first year we were there, this would be 1980. I hope I have the story right.

186
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Reagan was running against, I think it was Jimmy Carter, maybe for Carter's second term or something like that. And even being Berkeley and think that Carter was a shoe in.

187
00:21:50,400 --> 00:22:02,400
And of course, I think you won no state but Massachusetts or something like that. And, you know, so again, you're in this little bubble of Berkeley and you know, everything's very progressive. You know, realize where the country's at.

188
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:16,400
And so we said it's our little bit this last election. Yeah. Tell me a bit more about this time. I progress through your PhD years. Yeah, the PhD in Berkeley was really a good for me. I really enjoyed Cal Berkeley a lot.

189
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:27,400
It had a lot of sort of what I was mentioning about. Yeah, the environmental stuff, the foam and the science. And also out a lot, still a lot of the traditional stuff, some of the older economists and

190
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:47,400
and so-called, it's very, very famous people, Hank Fox, John Zavnuska, my main mentor at Berkeley, Bill Libby, very charismatic guy, very much really in the mold that I've taken on a mic, or I've kind of been a spokesperson, if you will, for the use of genetic engineering as a technology in forestry.

191
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Which is a difficult thing. And it's difficult, biologically, it's difficult socially. A lot of the incredible power of environmental groups around the world that's exploded during my life.

192
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:11,400
They're almost all opposed to either unilateral or extremely negative. So Bill was kind of, he was a proponent of cloning in forestry. So, you know, you got to a wild forest now. Every tree is a unique genotype.

193
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Like humans mostly are with the exception of the occasional identical twin. And he said, well, what if you could pick the very most productive one out of this mass of variation, you know, not just one, but the top 10, the top 100 for production purposes.

194
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:36,400
For wild forest, you'll maintain all the diversity you possibly can, but for production forests, if we could clone it, the benefits would be you, clone them, the benefits would be you.

195
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:46,400
And so he argued that his whole career and had some success. I mean, some of it was used, but he was very much pushing against the tide at that point. The industry was very traditional.

196
00:23:46,400 --> 00:24:05,400
And then the environmental tide as well. So I've said in a sense, following in its footsteps, which is interesting, you know, being a good biologist, I think, but being also outspoken on some of these policy issues and using sort of innovative, new, socially novel genetic technology.

197
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:15,400
And me and the GMO area and then the the cloning area. So anyway, you know, he is a very outspoken guy and so he is very influential to me.

198
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:32,400
And but the whole intellectual environment of Berkeley was very stimulating. I T8 and forest policy. So, you know, as a young scientist, I would say, have a limited notion of how policies are made and how laws are passed and what they mean.

199
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:47,400
They just figure, you know, you learn how it works in nature and then you do it smarter and better. And the notion that there's all these layers of rules and regs and perceptions, invested interests, you know, we're just kind of naive.

200
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:59,400
It's just that simple. And so being at Berkeley was a time where I really sort of got my eyes opened up, you know, taking and teaching about forest policy, just, you know, realize that, you know, scientists really want to change the world.

201
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,400
They really need to be out there. They can't be naive in their labs and their little fields. I have to be out there interacting with society.

202
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:18,400
And, you know, I think I've done some of that, not as much as some of my colleagues, but, you know, and I think today you see a lot of activity on campuses and that scientists need to do even more.

203
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I mean, I have this March on Science, March 4 science coming up in April and I think it's science to say, you know, it's just not going to be okay to be quiet. You have to get out there.

204
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:42,400
And speaking for science is also, I'm rambling around a bit, but speaking for science is also really complicated. The scientists are all biased and ideological, like everybody else. So it's a really messy thing.

205
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Your dissertation was on Stolagenetic Science, that correct?

206
00:25:46,400 --> 00:26:02,400
It was, yeah, it was back in those days. They had these enzyme technologies called ice enzymes or alazzynes. So it turns out that, you know, you have thousands of proteins in your body, trees due to, and due to genetic variation, the forms of those proteins vary.

207
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:28,400
They just do what they do, but they do it a little bit differently. And so back in the 60s, 70s, 80s scientists realized that instead of measuring genetic variation, see based on variation and height of people like ourselves that are influenced by the environment, how you have will you eat, as well as your DNA, you could look right at the products of DNA and these proteins.

208
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:40,400
They weren't able to look at DNA itself yet. So that whole alazzyne genetic diversity technology was very, very big for 30 years.

209
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:50,400
And that's my thesis is about trying to see if you can look at the amount of genetic polymorphism, variability in these enzymes, and trees, and could you predict their productivity?

210
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Are trees that have a greater diversity of enzymes, are they more productive and natural environment, using the materials that are available to me. That was the question that I tried to answer.

211
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:07,400
And I had some success in the sense that I got some publications out about it in good journals, but by no means that I resolve it at that level.

212
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Now that question, actually, a bigger question in science still continues.

213
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,400
So you finished up at Cal in 1985 and then you arrived at OSU, how did that come about?

214
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:32,400
That was an amazing thing. So I did this thesis that was really about genetic polymorphism, whether it predicts productivity and environmental stress tolerance, was another element of it.

215
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And it had experimental plantations, but it wasn't really about production, it wasn't about biotechnology. By any means that wasn't called biotechnology, we didn't have that word really back then.

216
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,400
And back at the time in the 80s when I was at Cal, the field of biotechnology came to be called biotechnology.

217
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,400
So what we're combating DNA, cutting and splicing genes, was starting.

218
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:06,400
It started in bacteria a few years earlier and scientists were beginning to use its study diseases, the study cancer, to study human pathogens of various sorts.

219
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
And then it started percolating into plants where people were using it the same way.

220
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:18,400
And then scientists figured out how they could transfer genes from one organism to another.

221
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:29,400
So they could do, say there was what people have done in bacteria years earlier, they could now do an implant so the possibility of genetic engineering plants for enhanced traits suddenly was there.

222
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
And everybody was talking about it.

223
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I remember I think it was 84 years before I graduated. My mentor Tom Lettingley, I mentioned from Yale, it went to Berkeley, held a big conference about how should we be using biotechnologies in forestry.

224
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:58,400
What are the opportunities, what are the constraints? And I'm watching this and I'm not a biotechnologist. I didn't really know what DNA was per se, apart from, and suddenly it's like this is the next big thing.

225
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:08,400
It's coming at us. And then the year 84, 85, depending on exactly how you dated, the first genetic engineer plant was created.

226
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,400
And then two years later, the first genetic engineer tree up off our tree that I've actually continued to work on mostly.

227
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:22,400
And my career was created. And the forest service was working on it just seemed like this is just a big, a big wonderful thing.

228
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:34,400
It was a big scientific technological challenge. And so I remember when this job came open at Oregon State, I was somewhere around December or so of 84, maybe January of 85.

229
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:42,400
And I remember seeing it, someone pointed out to me, so we've always had Oregon State. We've always had really strong forest genetics.

230
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:50,400
It was a sub-discipline of forest science. And we've been strong in, at OSU, we've been strong in the forest service right across the parking lot.

231
00:29:50,400 --> 00:30:05,400
And so we had a geneticist, Kim Chang, who was retiring. And so they said, well, what should we do? Should we hire another Kim Chang? Kim worked on psychology, meaning chromosome level, genetic biology of trees, Douglas Farr.

232
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Or should we start going down deeper? Just go down to the DNA level. That's where the science is going on. It's all this foaming going on.

233
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:22,400
And so we said, we're going to take a risk and hire a biotechnologist. And I don't think any other forestry school had done so yet.

234
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:33,400
But at that time, there were two or three that did it. So I don't remember if it was us, or if you see Stater, who was actually number one, but we were right there instead of taking this risk really to invest in this new area.

235
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:42,400
And so at that point, there were not a cadre of forest biotechnology, PhDs, and postdocs around. Because the field didn't exist.

236
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:54,400
There were a couple just starting who had done work and other species, barley, a colleague of mine, Dave Neal, and I know what you grabbed, very great scientists, had done a postdoc and barley learning some of that stuff.

237
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:06,400
And so I was intrigued that these were some of my competitors and for this job. Anyway, so I asked my mentors, I just said, you know, what's with this biotechnology thing? Is this like flash in the pan?

238
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Should I apply for this job? I don't have backness. Yeah, you should apply for it.

239
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Yours qualified as anybody getting how young this field is. And then I went on this crash course of learning about biotechnology. And so I applied and they basically hired me on the notion that I had potential to grow with the field.

240
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:41,400
And I would say, I just think that turned out to be a pretty good guess. And so that's how it started. I really, this is really a new venture for me. It was a new venture for Forestry and OSU. And it's had a number of turns that no one predicted.

241
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:49,400
But it's from a science point of view from a career, a development point of view, it's been very successful.

242
00:31:49,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Yeah, sounds like a nice piece of strategic thinking or visionary thinking. I think so. Yeah, I think they knew they were doing that. They didn't really know where it was going to go. And I got here, you know, I said, so what do you want me to do? I said, I don't know.

243
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Well, what's biotechnology figured out and do it and actually the first five, seven years. I realized that genetic engineering was not really, you know, it had been done once in one place. A tree was engineered, but it wasn't ready to go.

244
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:29,400
So what can I do and what I realized I could do? And I was also very successful and made a name for myself early was I could use these DNA techniques to figure out the evolution of some of our major tree species.

245
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I think I had the most important paper at that time on pines and how they evolved. I had the most important paper at that time on Douglas Ferret and it's relatives and where it came from.

246
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:47,400
And relationship to all its relatives around the Pacific, where I'm in the on. So there's a lot of insights that you know when you get to the DNA level.

247
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:04,400
The when you get an insight about relationships and evolution, they're often very, very strong. This is this thing, this precision. You get when you sequence or analyze DNA to that level suddenly people say, well, it's not just his opinion about whether the size of the cones or the thickness of the barks and most important trade.

248
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,400
It's this sort of random look at the DNA and it just shouts at you which trees are most related to which and who the common ancestor is.

249
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,400
And so what I did the first five or seven years, I did a lot of this genetic evolutionary analysis.

250
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I did some really high quality science and the people at OSU even though my dean department had what a love to see me like help the forest industry right then and then I said, this is the right thing to be doing right now.

251
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,400
And so it was, you know, they did have a very open mind about it.

252
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:45,400
But then eventually and perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, but I'll mention briefly what happened in Oregon and in Northwest is people started worrying about sources of wood and pulp.

253
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Because we had the spotted alowars, we had rising environmentalism and people were afraid there wouldn't be enough wood.

254
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:02,400
So they started investing the Department of Energy made major investments in growing these popular trees and plantations like the ones along I-84 that we talked about.

255
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Now those are products of that and so people started doing series research and that there's a big project at University of Washington on that.

256
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,400
And I realized that I had the expertise that was developed to add a genetic engineering element to it.

257
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
And that started early 90s, late 80s, early 90s.

258
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:31,400
And I started working with the industries and developed an industry cooperative consortium basically a public private partnership and our college of forestry has a bunch of those and still does where they provide money.

259
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Not a lot of money but enough to sort of help guide it toward things of interest to them.

260
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:45,400
And then we at the University said use our resources and go out and go grant dollars to sort of make good science of relevance happen.

261
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,400
And working in poplars, I mentioned the first tree that was engineered was a popular.

262
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Suddenly people are thinking about growing poplars on a major scale in Oregon and in the Northwest.

263
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Let's use this technology to do it even better.

264
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:06,400
And so a lot of my career has been said if I took that step for this consortium, started working in poplars and genetic engineering.

265
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,400
And I quickly got involved also in some of the social and legal issues of it.

266
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Like I said earlier, those are big and they continue to be big.

267
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:27,400
So that was the reason I made that shift early in my career at OSU into the genetic engineering per se and also helping to deal with the social elements, working with industries, forest industries, biotech industries.

268
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,400
And so that's been kind of the big middle of my career and still continues.

269
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,400
What is it about poplars that make most attractive to this work?

270
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,400
You know they're much better from a science point of view, they're much better model organisms.

271
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,400
So everything about Douglas Fur and Pine you can imagine when it comes to doing genetic manipulation is hard.

272
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I was terpenized I mentioned early, well they mess up your getting your DNA out of analyzing it.

273
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
People have sort of got it got over it these days but it's just one other thing.

274
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
The genomes are huge.

275
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
In poplars we figured out pretty early on.

276
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:13,400
In fact the number one tree, how to insert a gene or modify a gene and then grow the progeny and see how that one gene affects them.

277
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,400
And in the conifer that's still incredibly difficult to do, very expensive and very difficult.

278
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
So something about them makes them easier to engineer.

279
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
They're genomes are small, they grow faster.

280
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,400
It's very powerful in genetics when you make a genetic change or you have a genetic variant of interest to make copies of it.

281
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Just for replication so you have high quality science, poplars in nature, clone themselves all the time.

282
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
That's you know these astins you may have read about these grows of astins.

283
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
There are kinds of poplars can cover many many acres in one single genotype.

284
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
That doesn't happen much in conifers.

285
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
So they're easy to make copies of.

286
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,400
So there's a bunch of reasons easy to transform small genome, easy to make copies of faster growing.

287
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,400
That make them very good genetic models.

288
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,400
And then also you know the industry was already looking at making hybrids between different species to increase productivity.

289
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
They were already cloning them for plantations.

290
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
And so the genetics was very intense.

291
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,400
And then adding genetic engineering as another kind of genetics made sense because you'd already...

292
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,400
The industry had already brought it in science, has already brought it to this level.

293
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Let's take that level further.

294
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,400
When you look at Douglas Ferrer or Arkindz, even today, the genetics is primitive.

295
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
You know compared to any crop species compared to poplars.

296
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
And so it's much harder to say genetic engineering is what we need to do now.

297
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
We're still sort of in the neolithic with breeding.

298
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
So it doesn't make as much sense.

299
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
The accomplish it does.

300
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,400
So you have all these reasons, the biology as well as the state of breeding.

301
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,400
And then also if you're making a particular product with poplars like pulp or particular kinds of wood or biofuels,

302
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
you can optimize it much more.

303
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
And that's how the industry came about, whereas in this sort of generalized forestry,

304
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,400
we're making all kinds of things under all kinds of conditions.

305
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
We don't control the environment as much as grown on it.

306
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You know, steep hillsides and poppers, it's more agricultural.

307
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,400
In fact, they're regulated as agricultural crops by Oregon and Washington.

308
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:26,400
And so everything about the social and biological environment made it sensible to consider trying to add in genetic engineering as an ex genetic technology.

309
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Yeah.

310
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Backing up just a hair, I'm interested in collecting a little bit of institutional knowledge about the university and of the college.

311
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,400
What do you remember about your early impressions of OSU and of the college of forestry?

312
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,400
You know, the things that stand out over all these years, Dean Stoltenberg, who hired me,

313
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:57,400
and successor George Brown, just this incredible sense of, you know,

314
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
out there and making impact.

315
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Serve the state, serve the nation, serve just this incredible ethic of service.

316
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,400
You know, I came in here still, somewhat young, still very much wanting to do science.

317
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
And wanting to survive also in academia, I was very nervous.

318
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,400
And I'm not going to be able to get tenure.

319
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,400
And they really wanted much more.

320
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
They weren't interested so much in making us survive and get my name grand.

321
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
But what am I going to do to change the world for the better?

322
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Well, how am I going to, and also they had a sense of how am I going to serve the Oregon industry better and make Oregon more productive and economically more vital.

323
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
So I just felt that and I felt the pressure of it.

324
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,400
But I also felt that it was wholesome and real and good.

325
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,400
And so that was another reason for the transition to poplars.

326
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I mentioned I did this genetic work early on on the evolutionary relationships at different species.

327
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
That was a great way to use biotech methods to advance science.

328
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
But it wasn't really going to advance Oregon far sure.

329
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Right? And except in a very fundamental level.

330
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
And so when poplars came along, and in fact, I could use genetic engineering.

331
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
I could do great science.

332
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,400
And it can have an impact on the industry and on society maybe tomorrow.

333
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,400
If we can really grow trees, you know, 10, 20% better by using genetic engineering methods.

334
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,400
And we can do it in poplars in my lab and get it out there.

335
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
You know, that's exciting.

336
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
That conjunction of application.

337
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:37,400
And you know, one thing that we've worked on too for many years that tied into my environmental background is, you know, it was pretty obvious to me that

338
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,400
genetic engineering trees, poplars, we're going to be controversial for variety of reasons.

339
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
We've already seen it in agriculture and medicine.

340
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,400
And so it's not like society is going to just say, rar, rar, rar, let's have more of it.

341
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,400
They're going to say, I don't like this, or they're going to say, who controls it?

342
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
And so on and so forth.

343
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
And how should we regulate it? What's the role of the EPA being?

344
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Should we really have very strict regulations?

345
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
So, you know, it was obvious to me that was all going to happen.

346
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:15,400
And what's happening and the biggest issue that science can deal with about that is, so release of propagules into natural environments.

347
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,400
So I think cognitively you cross a line when you say we're going to genetic engineering or something.

348
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Then you're really saying that humans are really taking control of this organism and changing it to their needs.

349
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Of course, we do that with conventional breeding, all of our crops, corn, whatever it is,

350
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
are looking at nothing like their wild relatives.

351
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
And we've made that cognitive leap.

352
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
But I think now we're even more conscious of that than we used to be.

353
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,400
The genetic engineering, because it's an unnatural, mostly unnatural technique.

354
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,400
It does happen in nature, but not commonly.

355
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,400
You cross this cognitive line where it was obvious to me that people are not going to, well, people might say,

356
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,400
well, except in these intensive popular plantations that look nothing like a natural, that genetic engineering can have a place,

357
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,400
but I don't want the pollen and seeds spreading out into wild riparian cottonwood areas,

358
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,400
where really what we value is biodiversity and all the ecosystem functions, that's going to be a problem.

359
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
And indeed it is.

360
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,400
So we said, you know, so we need to, for those plantation trees, we need to shut down flowering.

361
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
We need to treat grow faster as a result.

362
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,400
But the main thing is that even though poppers do vegetative, we spread a little bit, we can manage that.

363
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,400
But we can't manage pollen floating miles and miles in there.

364
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,400
And so another exciting thing was in addition to developing the gene transfer methods and working with industries to test things,

365
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,400
we said we're going to develop the genetic containment technology, so society accepts it.

366
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,400
And we continue to make that our focus all these years, and that really tied into my sort of environmental consciousness coming in.

367
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Let's use advanced technology, but let's do it right.

368
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:06,400
And so that's probably what I'm most known for around the world is developing this containment technology and putting it into practice.

369
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
It takes a long time.

370
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,400
You know, the science takes a while, getting the genes in, and then if you're studying flowering, you have to wait years, because trees don't flower right away.

371
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:25,400
So what really is, I didn't realize there's so much at the time when I made that decision in the early 90s, I was committing to two or three decades of experiments, and that's what's happened.

372
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,400
You know, they're still going on, they're still on the field outside for a while.

373
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,400
At what point did you start to receive some pushback from various outside entities? Was that pretty much from the get-go?

374
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:45,400
You know, in the beginning, there really has been, and I don't know if anybody's measured it, I'm sure I should have said that, so they haven't measured it.

375
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
I should probably go find the papers, if they've done it.

376
00:43:48,400 --> 00:44:00,400
But I used to mock some of the media coverage, and including OSU's own public relations, that here's biotechnology, it's to answer to all our problems.

377
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:14,400
It's going to feed the world, it's going to revolutionize, we're going to make square trees, that just go right into the boards, all this crazy stuff that I knew was not going to happen, and I'm not going to happen in my lifetime.

378
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
So it was heightened.

379
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,400
And society, that's where they were sort of giddy about it.

380
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:41,400
I think it was the late 90s when various things happened in agricultural biotechnology, where then the media coverage became pretty negative, and big environmental groups like Greenpeace, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funds, essentially environmental corporations, decided they were against all of it everywhere,

381
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:49,400
whether you were making, you know, a fight in the need to deal with blindness, whether you're trying to make tree, or against all of it, it was an ideological thing.

382
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:59,400
And so, probably because organizations like that, with a lot of power and money changed, things shifted, things became much more negative.

383
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:08,400
And then, again, in the later 90s, when you started to see a lot of vandalism, first in agricultural biotechnology, then in forestry.

384
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:21,400
And so, in 2001, was a big year here at Oregon State in Corvallis, we had vandalism, somebody came in during the middle of the night, you know, in Corvallis, and cut through a wire fence and damage to about a thousand trees.

385
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:28,400
It was at night, and you can't tell the ones that engineering, engineering for ones that aren't, so most of them, they actually didn't get what they wanted to.

386
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:42,400
You know, it was indication of just the intensity of the issue that I think was in March, and then in June, there was arson against the collaborative of mine at the University of Washington, and his building was almost completely burned down.

387
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,400
A collaborating industry in Klatsk and I had a million dollars in farm equipment damage, so it really ramped up, and it really got intense.

388
00:45:51,400 --> 00:46:15,400
I was the chair of an international society for tree biotechnology, and we were having a meeting in Oxford in, I guess it was 1999, a couple of years earlier, and the one field trial of the engineering tree in England was vandalized the evening of our international scientific conference.

389
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:32,400
And so all these things, you know, told me that holy cow society is not with us. And then in Europe in particular, which was sort of violently reacting against Lonsanto, and bringing in, you know, you know, Genevieve engineering soybeans as animal feed into the country and blockating them and all that.

390
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:49,400
When these trees were damaged outside of Oxford, these trees were trees that had, without going into the technical details, they were engineered to be easier to pulp, meaning take less energy, less chemicals to produce the same amount of pulp.

391
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:59,400
So it's something that we have thought of scientists, the environmentalists were in love, and that we have strong support for it, but no, the bigger narrative in society really dominated that.

392
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:15,400
So when these trees were destroyed, the science about we were doing was irrelevant, and the story line in the major media, the Guardian and others was Monsanto now, you know, they're wreak havoc and the food supply, now they're going to wreak havoc and are forests.

393
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:26,400
So we were all like holy cow, you know, what are these guys smoking? But you know, that's how big then the social narrative is about genetic engineering and GMOs.

394
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:44,400
The details of the science really don't matter much, and that's a hard thing to remember. But anyway, so, you know, 1999, 2001, also in 2001, we had 9-11 in the United States, and the government called eco-terrorist terrorist.

395
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,400
They pursued them the same way as they pursued people who are bombing the World Trade Center. And so that kind of stuff stopped.

396
00:47:51,400 --> 00:48:00,400
The guys who did the stuff in Oregon and Washington were mostly cotton, but in jail. And Europe continued in the US, it stopped.

397
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,400
But that was, you know, a big marker that things were just crazy at a hand.

398
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:18,400
The site is actually continued to ramp up after that. And, you know, one of the conditions we have today is that green piece and others who are very against this stuff have created conditions where forest industries really can't use genetic engineering.

399
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Period. Their own certification organizations don't allow it, even in research. So the field trials, the collaborative work I dealt with industry years ago, doesn't happen anymore.

400
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Because, or happens outside of the Northwest in very special conditions, because the social conditions have become so hostile.

401
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,400
You know, just like you, just like in organic food, you can't have any GMO in it no matter what.

402
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,400
Even though scientists will say, well, there's good uses of it. In addition to the ones that are questionable, it's an all or nothing thing.

403
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:59,400
And that's where society is at with forestry uses right now. And one of the things I've done in my career is try to argue that we need research to find out what are the good ones.

404
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,400
And we find out what are the good uses, what are the not so good uses, how we can make a not so good use and make it good.

405
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:19,400
And, you know, that kind of, that's really not gone anywhere, even though I've tried to sort of what I would consider to have a more middle of the road, more reasonable science based agenda, the environmental community, the marketing,

406
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:30,400
and the environment in particular feels like this is the way they have to be to get the consumers to buy their products, to charge more for it, and maybe do the right thing on their view.

407
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:43,400
So, it's become a hostile world. I'm really, I'll be able to finish my career using this technology, but by and large, in forestry around the world, the amount of interest in genetic engineering as I'm death that has really gone.

408
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:51,400
It's not zero, but it's really gone way down. The social pushback has been big enough anybody could have imagined.

409
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:59,400
So, how have you been able to navigate that or how have you, have, I'm forced to adapt or compromise?

410
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Yeah, you know, it's a reality, and you know, it's important to recognize it's sort of a 12 steps thing, recognize what you can change and what you can't.

411
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:19,400
And so, you know, I've written a bunch of papers about how a smarter way would be to regulate what a smarter way to be, to market it.

412
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I had a paper in Science Magazine last year. I've been able to publish in the very best journals, putting forward ideas of collaborative with lawyers and economists, to get the social stuff right, being a biologist.

413
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:44,400
But, you know, there's a larger, larger forces, larger social economic forces. You know, big companies profit from, you know, avoiding GMOs. They're not going to stop doing it.

414
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:54,400
You know, it's not just philosophical, it's a huge profit margin to saying you're cleaner than now. I call it greenwashing, but it's everywhere in the marketplace.

415
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,400
Now, I can't, I can't buy a loaf of bread that I want without a no GMO seal, even though I'd like to avoid it because I know it's meaningless.

416
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:19,400
So, that's, you know, it's a bigger thing. So, what are you doing that, man? It's from my point of view. You know, we had at OSU, we had an outreach and biotechnology program, mainly funded to the College of Ag, probably funded through Forestry, that I was the chair of the director for about eight years.

417
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:26,400
It was kind of a soft program. It used to be something that was a hard program, an extension, and instead of got softer over the years.

418
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:38,400
But, we did, we had a, we had a website and we hosted 40 public lectures. We got amazing scientists, moral law, the common and popular public in Corralis about all these issues.

419
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:45,400
So, that was one way that I thought I could sort of really help change society or make society smarter about this.

420
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:57,400
And I think it was super successful. But, I think OSU, the College of Agriculture, has sort of tired over this and there's only so much science can do.

421
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:04,400
And so, they've sort of backed away. They don't want to alienate their more organic elements, they're not an GMO.

422
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,400
And so, most universities, not all of them, but some large majority have said, this is bigger than we can deal with.

423
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:21,400
Our state funds are being cut. We'd rather have somebody who's breeding berries than nobody breeding berries and have somebody fighting this wave of anti-biotechnology.

424
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Because it's very complicated. It is. If you do a responsible outreach about it, it's not just RRRR. It's here's the trade-offs.

425
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:42,400
There's a pros in the cons and the center. So, it's a complicated story. So, anyway, from my own point of view, I've sort of fought road scientific papers, talked to regulators.

426
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:51,400
I still give 304 or 5 talks a year about, I talked at the public library in Salem to the environmental educators consortium up there a few weeks ago.

427
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,400
So, I still do things occasionally. But, the basic I've said, you know, I could do research to advance the science and the technology.

428
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:08,400
And when society is ready, if they're ever ready, it'll be there. And so, that's where I put 95% of my energies is doing the science.

429
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:18,400
And it's hard. One thing, the conditions are sufficiently adverse in both Europe and the United States for applied biotechnology in the public sector.

430
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:27,400
That's very hard to go to a USDA or department of energy grant power and say, I have an idea for a better genetic engineer treat.

431
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:34,400
We're going to tweak this and that. And then they're going to say, well, it's a GMO, right? So, it's going to be really hard to get regulatory approval.

432
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Companies are going to have trouble growing it. So, we're not going to fund that. And that's happened the last 15 years. It's very hard.

433
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:51,400
But the one kind of funding that you can still get a little bit of is if you want to say, well, we need better safety technology.

434
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:58,400
We need to not worry so much about getting better trees, but getting safer trees. And so, that's really that.

435
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Middle niche has allowed me to say that continue doing the research I do on genetic containment and so forth.

436
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,400
And so, that's one of the ways I've been able to keep doing what I believe is interesting and important.

437
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Getting the science done, testing it in the field, to me, it's very important. Not just that I do laboratory work, because you need to go out into a real, real world.

438
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Most laboratory ideas don't actually work because the world is complicated. And so, I have stuff out. I have 10 acres growing in Carvalis now that are testing ideas from the field, from the laboratory.

439
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:43,400
At any rate, but it's this safety orientation that's allowed me to keep productive, keep doing good science, even though the social milieu is extremely adverse and funding is very hard to get.

440
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,400
So, the work on bioseafety and sterile nursery plants has almost been a survival strategy in your point.

441
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Exactly. Yeah. And it's survival, but it's also something I said I'm interested in. And when I started that construction, started working on poppers, I said, we need to figure out containment.

442
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:11,400
And so, I'm still doing that. And luckily, that hasn't dried up. You know, it could anytime, but it hasn't so far. And I do work that is state of the art.

443
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:25,400
It's competitive throughout science and throughout agriculture. So, these are the panel that funds this. It's mainly a USDA panel called biotechnology risk assessment that won the ARS thing that you just mentioned was a separate thing related to it.

444
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:36,400
But that's funding all of agriculture. So, we have to be doing work on trees that is competitive with the very best work in corn. And that's hard because they have a lot more money in there, a lot more advanced genetics.

445
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:47,400
But I'm proud that I've been able to do that. I can compete with those guys. Because the science we do is just as good. If I didn't dug the store, I probably couldn't. But I can do it in public.

446
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Something else for you that caught my eye was the project on carbon sequestration using copper trees. Yeah, about that.

447
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting. If you decide you're going to grow trees seriously for some purpose, meaning they're going to have a dominant dedicated use.

448
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:21,400
What nature gives you is okay. And you can tweak it further. But often you want something very different. And so, people do ecological modeling.

449
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Started saying, well, you know, if we produce trees that had more roots and less stem, which is contrary to what people do in forestry. They tend to want the fastest growing tallest tree.

450
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:47,400
I said, no, maybe we don't want the tallest one. Maybe we want the fastest one with lots of roots. And the roots will add to the carbon and the soil and decay much slower than stem material.

451
00:56:47,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Maybe maybe we can even make the roots so they decay more slowly and hence the amount of of turpinoids and phenolics, these compounds that slow down decomposition so the carbon stays around in the soil longer.

452
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Because those ideas that we could change the allocation between tops and bottoms and change the chemistry of roots that would promote carbon sequestration, that was the idea.

453
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:19,400
We also thought if we had a tree that has more roots, it'll survive great stresses. It'll bioremediate soils better.

454
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:27,400
We also have a problem in industry that sometimes we can select the fastest growing trees and this has happened in the Northwest with Poplar as they blow down.

455
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:43,400
We get these giant windstorms every now and then and they just blow over. And so, and then also we have an agriculture of the green revolution, which is not a biotech GMO thing, but it's a bunch of technologies starting in about the 1960s.

456
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:53,400
The key one is a scientist figured out that we don't want taller wheat, we don't want taller rice, when you just select for productivity, everything gets taller.

457
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:00,400
And then when you have a storm, they blow over, they lodge. And you probably see this around Pendleton that happens occasionally.

458
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:12,400
And then the crop is lost, the roots, the qualities goes. So what the scientists did is they found a dwarfism gene, semi dwarfism, that keeps the wheat instead of being in a way over your head and keeps it about here.

459
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:21,400
And mostly we see around our areas like that. But that's a particular gene brought in from an Asian variety that constrains you from getting tall.

460
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:37,400
So it gets more root, so it gets more seeds on it, and it doesn't launch. So it was also that thinking that maybe we can sequester more carbon, have a tree that's more drought taller and bioremediates better by having them be shorter.

461
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:48,400
And I'm not talking about three feet tall, this is a tree. So instead of 100 feet, you might be 60 feet. Whatever, between slow it down and change the distribution and the quality of the biomass.

462
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:55,400
And so that's what that project was about. Trying to tweak these trees for these particular goals. And we were successful at it.

463
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:04,400
We did, you know, and some of the genes we tested were genes from the green revolution wheat. And because the mechanisms are very fundamental, they work quite well.

464
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:13,400
And so we were able to get shorter trees with more roots. And, but was anybody going to use them? No, because they're a GMO and because they're, it would change the industry.

465
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Industry doesn't work that way. Breeding would have to be radically different. We'd have to get a GMO probably into the breeding program.

466
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Because one of the things you're doing is you're creating trees that are smaller, grows fast, while the nature, those trees die, right, because they can't get light.

467
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:39,400
So you'd have to change the whole way you breed trees and evaluate them. And anyway, it would be very disruptive to the industry.

468
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:50,400
But with the GMO element, it was a non-starter. So we did the work. It was successful. And, you know, there it is. The science is done. Does somebody ever want to pick it up? I don't know.

469
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,400
But that's what that was about in short of it. Yeah.

470
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:04,400
And that was a project that had an association with SunGran, is that correct? That's right. Yeah. That was a Department of Energy USDA funded. There was a couple of them.

471
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:13,400
The biggest funding we got was from the biofuels section of the Department of Energy. That was a big, and then we had some supplementary funding from other places.

472
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:22,400
We've also got funding from the SunGran and a couple other places on trying to make a tree that would have some valuable coal products.

473
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,400
So one of the problems with growing bioenergy is that energy is cheap in the world.

474
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Unless we tax fossil fuels really aggressively, which were not almost anywhere. As aggressively as it probably should be, they're not competitive.

475
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:45,400
So how do you make them more competitive? One of the ways is to engineer in some product that is high value, a new biochemical that would be have some other higher use in industry.

476
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:57,400
So we've tried to get trees that produce bioplastics, things that you can use. And we're already using the similar versions from bacteria, these cups that decompose, that you can put in the compost.

477
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,400
We tried to make the same kind of thing in popular trees. But we couldn't make enough to make it economic.

478
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:12,400
So we really need a major engineering leap to make that work. And so we're just no funding for it. But it's also a hard problem.

479
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,400
But that's what one of the SunGran projects was about was trying to figure out how to make those biofuels.

480
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,400
We collaborated with companies that were doing in a different crops. And it's a hard problem.

481
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:30,400
I thought a student who's sort of working on an element of it, but it would require a pretty serious effort.

482
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Has any of your work intersected with the cross-laminated products at all?

483
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Only that the short answers know. I was at a conference, the PENCO Foundation, is this Forestry Foundation funded by this.

484
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:57,400
I assume which guy who really wants to infuse advanced engineering technology of all kinds to make better wood products, including the laminated products for Oregon and for the industry.

485
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:04,400
Why aren't we doing genetic engineering? He's looking at all the amazing things in engineering in the traditional sense.

486
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Why not genetic engineering? And I went to this conference with other engineers. And I told them, it's the broader social element.

487
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,400
And it's also that the industry is not ready for it because we're still sort of in the neolithic breeding wise.

488
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:23,400
And so it would just be like trying to teach a baby to run before it's able to walk, just didn't make sense.

489
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,400
He didn't want to hear that, but that's the reality of it.

490
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:39,400
So it could be done. But before we did that, for example, if you're going to have the precision of genetic engineering to try to get the fibers to be bonded in a way that would be better for CLT or glue better, whatever it might be.

491
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:46,400
The first thing you want to do is just homogenize the wood. So as an engineer, you want to know what's going to be a certain thing.

492
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:53,400
And then you can tweak it right. And right now, in our forest, the variability in wood properties is incredible.

493
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,400
So you first want to be able to probably clone trees.

494
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,400
And the problem with that is that it's not affordable in the industry right now.

495
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,400
So unless you get to that, that's again, you know, crawl walk before you run.

496
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:12,400
We're not going to get there. So I also told him that the industry until we can get to those barriers, they're not ready for it.

497
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,400
And that's no matter of economics and probably also social acceptability.

498
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,400
Would it be okay to have clone Douglass fur all over the landscape?

499
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,400
I don't know. What does the Sierra Club say? They probably hate the idea.

500
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:33,400
So, you know, so industry, but due to economics plus concern, it's just not happening.

501
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Tell me about the Leopold Leadership Program. I'm like, God, that was something really important to you.

502
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Yeah, that really is a, that's a great thing. And it, you know, resonates today.

503
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:52,400
So Jane Lumpchenko, an OSU, a standalone professor, you know, president of Triple White House, National Academy member, you know, amazing scientist and person.

504
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:03,400
She and some colleagues said, you know, scientists don't have the skills and the network to communicate with the media and decision makers like they need to.

505
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:10,400
You know, her interest was in getting more environmental science and science in general into policy.

506
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,400
You know, and most politicians don't have science backgrounds, almost none of them do.

507
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,400
And so you need to talk their language. You need to know, you know, how they, how decisions are made.

508
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:25,400
You need to know how to talk to the media, you know, how to talk to science journalists, non science journalists.

509
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,400
So, they she created this program. It was funded by various foundations over the years.

510
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,400
It's still centered at Stanford, an organization at Stanford, still goes on.

511
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:41,400
And they train cohorts of something like 20 or so leading environmental scientists.

512
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,400
People sort of in a mid career who you can see have been very successful and are going to make an impact.

513
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:53,400
And our, our, our, our called to, to speak to the world, to change the world.

514
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Very much like who I was growing up and who I still am.

515
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,400
And so you apply, you say what you do, you look at your publication record, your passions, your skills.

516
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,400
And so I was one, I think I may be the only person who would call himself a biotechnologist in that program.

517
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
It's mostly ecologists.

518
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,400
Two lawyers involved, double economists. But pretty much very strongly environmental people.

519
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,400
People not so much working on the, the technology side of it.

520
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,400
But anyway, this, this group has been going on now. I'm going to guess 20 years, something like that.

521
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Well, they have these cohorts of scientists who come through and a lot of them are now, you know, very well established in the field.

522
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,400
And there's a network of them and they communicate and they collaborate.

523
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,400
And they try to organize action or let us to the editor and conferences.

524
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,400
So particularly now in, you know, with all the things going on in the job administration, it's kind of been, you know, come back to life.

525
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,400
And where they're really trying to do things and so forth.

526
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,400
And so anyway, that's, I'm part of that organization.

527
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,400
And you know, I love to see information that share about how to be more effective.

528
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,400
What do you do now as a scientist? What's the right thing to do?

529
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:11,400
There's a discussion going on about whether it's good or bad to engage in the March for science next month.

530
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Is that politicizing science more?

531
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,400
Making us more of a special interest group versus, you know, arbitrage of truth?

532
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Or not? Or we have to.

533
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,400
And so that's an example of how that network helps.

534
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,400
People think distributed information and so it's very nice.

535
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,400
You know, like I said, I'm kind of an outsider in it.

536
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:40,400
And I kind of feel like when it comes to GMO, those in biotechnology and agriculture, probably the majority of them are negative on it.

537
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,400
You know, and I'm kind of a lone wolf there and saying, this is powerful. We just have to use it right.

538
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,400
So, you know, so I'm involved in that and it's important to me.

539
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:57,400
But it's also a network of environmental scientists that are mostly not interested in the kind of stuff that I do.

540
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,400
But anyway, there it is. I'm not super active in a bi-need means probably because as I said, it doesn't.

541
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:11,400
It's kind of a little bit to the left, whatever it is of where I'm at in terms of using technology in the world.

542
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:17,400
Can you talk a bit more about GMOs with respect to food? That's obviously a big issue for people.

543
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:24,400
Yeah, you know, I followed that pretty intensive teacher batter at OSU. I've been doing that. I had this outreach program.

544
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:32,400
It's very hot and very political and, you know, I think one thing that's really clear is that it's mostly not about the science.

545
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:43,400
I think the people who are very against GMOs want to make it about very dangerous and adequately studied science.

546
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:53,400
And I just think for them, that's a tool of tactic. I think the people in the know no better than that.

547
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:00,400
So, but there's issues of intensive, probably the biggest issue is industrial agriculture in general.

548
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:08,400
It's incredible benefits and incredible harms. Probably plowing is the most damaging thing we do the whole planet.

549
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:18,399
But it's not just industrial agriculture that plows. It's organic agriculture and everybody else. And they often do it more.

550
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:26,399
And then you have use of agricultural chemicals, which are an incredible energy saver and productivity enhancer.

551
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:34,399
But they can be used with they can harm things. You know, the Rachel Carson and Silent Spring helped show that for DDT.

552
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:40,399
And so now we're in a whole different era than we were back then where things are intensively regulated and monitored.

553
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:45,399
And many bad things have been taken off markets and you know, at least in the western world.

554
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:54,399
And to get a chemical approved, you know, takes I think hundreds of millions of dollars of tests and studies and the labels that are restricted to use and so forth.

555
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:01,399
So there's a lot of safeguards built into the system we didn't have back in the old days. But it isn't good enough.

556
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:04,399
Now it's not going to be perfect. We're going to make mistakes.

557
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:18,399
So how do you think about chemicals used in agriculture? And you have systems like the organic certification system that say it won't use any except actually for quite a long list of exceptions if you read the details.

558
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:27,399
But so that's another element and the major GMR crops now use chemicals directly and directly.

559
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:32,399
They use chemicals in the form of promoting herbicides by being herbicide resistant.

560
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:40,399
They use chemicals in the sense of isolating a pesticide from a bacterium and putting it into plants.

561
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:47,399
And this pesticide is something called BT is one that's widely used in organic agriculture. So it's very, very, very safe.

562
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:52,399
And they've spliced it into a plant. Well now it's supposed to be very unsafe.

563
01:09:52,399 --> 01:10:00,399
So you know there's all of it anyway, but it involves things like chemicals and it involves intensive EPA regulation.

564
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:07,399
And the more you regulate doesn't mean that people feel better about it. It means it actually shines a big spotlight on it.

565
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:12,399
And so it's just extremely messy both from a society and so on.

566
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:19,399
And of course the science continues to grow and innovate. So there's new stuff all the time.

567
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:29,399
So how much regulation just impedes public benefits in peeds economic development versus protects the public and the environment.

568
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:38,399
And getting that right is crucial. And you know I by no means a supporter of the current presidential administration in the particular individual.

569
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,399
But the issue of how much regulation is too much is a really hard technical one.

570
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:47,399
And the sound bites you get in all the news media are generally misleading and wrong.

571
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:52,399
But in the area of biotech and I've written a lot I think the regulations are totally out of control.

572
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:57,399
There are some kinds of biotech that should be intensively regulated probably more than we have now.

573
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:01,399
And other kinds really there's this good record that there's no regulation needed at all.

574
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,399
Zero. We have this single gene editing.

575
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:10,399
The new technology from modifying the natural DNA there to for strenu reason which is what breeding does.

576
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,399
But now we do it with science and precision.

577
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:19,399
That's probably going to be regulated certainly in Europe like it's taking the gene from a far away species.

578
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:21,399
It's from my clinic just crazy.

579
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:23,399
Is this the CRISPR technique?

580
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,399
Yeah, that's the CRISPR technique. But that's kind of and you know that's a big source of controversy right now.

581
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:35,399
The USDA pedal to proposal to not regulate some parts of that which I think is you know innovative and forward looking.

582
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:38,399
I don't know what's going to happen under the current administration.

583
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:45,399
In Europe it's very likely to go that way either way the organic people are going to have already said I'm record they they will not accept it.

584
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:50,399
So you know it's just an ugly messy area frankly.

585
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:55,399
And it's right was traded off so I just gave a talk last night to my own laboratory group.

586
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:03,399
There was a very good paper lately on the record of GMO crops in terms of pesticide use.

587
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:07,399
To use more to use less these better kinds of chemicals.

588
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:09,399
And the reality is it's a mixed bag.

589
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:16,399
We're doing all that depending on the crop and the timeframe and and it's just that's the reality of it.

590
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:22,399
But we know there's also billions of benefits to the economy because it's also improved soil as a result.

591
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,399
So what's the right answer?

592
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:29,399
So if you like sort of simple answers this is not the area for you.

593
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,399
So that's you know that's so that's sort of I tried to when I speak about impeach about it.

594
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:43,399
I try to give students a sense of both the frustration and anger at this simple minded social response no GMO labels.

595
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:47,399
Organic certification you know I'm cleaner and better than you.

596
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:55,399
And the big reason of that people go to organic now so I GMOs regulations are so intense that breeders like me.

597
01:12:55,399 --> 01:13:03,399
I could be breeding populace for Oregon using GMO techniques except that it cost me 100 million dollars to release one variety.

598
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:16,399
Even if with with CRISPR it's just like on the other hand you know we have companies over using herbicides and creating herbicide resistant weeds.

599
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:24,399
So it's it's just really complicated and difficult you know so my own personal point of view is don't throw out the baby with a bath water.

600
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:31,399
You know take some intelligent mill ground but that's not where society's at in terms of marketing and labels.

601
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:37,399
That's not where regulations tend to be that the regulations reflect people's fears.

602
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:40,399
So regulators like to say they're science based.

603
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:42,399
No where are they really science based they try.

604
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,399
They're always trying but the political pressure is incredible.

605
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:58,399
In the US and in Europe to actually make a science based decision and the activist groups work so hard to influence the science to get their people on the boards and to change the way decisions are made.

606
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:07,399
So again you know I was so I used to be a member of Greenpeace and they are a club and friends of the earth and all these guys and I now I wouldn't give them a dollar.

607
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:12,399
So you know that's where I started right and now I don't trust them.

608
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:19,399
I give a lot of money to certain environmental organizations like the Nature Conservancy that are really science based but these guys are not.

609
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:21,399
So who's the good guys anymore.

610
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:26,399
So anyway in the whole food GMO food biotechnology or you get all that.

611
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,399
The good guys the bad guys the bad guys are the good guys.

612
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:32,399
How do you decide?

613
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:39,399
Yeah I have a note here to ask you about the future of forests.

614
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:40,399
Yeah right.

615
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:50,399
Yeah a big question but yeah and here you talk it feels to me like a lot of what you're doing now you're creating work that might be used in the future in a different environment.

616
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:59,399
Yeah and I think that's right is it fair to assume you think that the future forests might on some all depend upon genetic engineering?

617
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:09,399
Well you know I've made the argument one thing you have in the world with climate change with people traveling around the world with pests evolving ever more fast.

618
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:12,399
The stresses on forests are enormous.

619
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:20,399
There is you know various papers recording you know hundreds of introduced and new pests that are damaging forests everywhere.

620
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,399
It's an incredible difficult thing.

621
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:31,399
And you know the main way we deal with that is through bio control conventional breeding but sometimes those don't work.

622
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:36,399
And so one case you may know the story of the American chestnut I don't know if you're familiar with that.

623
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:45,399
It's a species that was a dominant species much like Douglas Fur around here all over the East Coast entirely destroyed by an exotic fungus.

624
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:55,399
And so that was a hundred years ago and now people have been working through conventional breeding and bio control to the story and so far not much left.

625
01:15:55,399 --> 01:16:02,399
And so a scientist in a state of University of New York has found he studied the mechanism of disease.

626
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:15,399
The pathogenesis how it really works and it's like other pathogens where he's found that they produce this thing called a xalic acid that actually is what kills the tissues that produces a xalic acid.

627
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:20,399
It kills the tissues and the fungus acts as kind of a saprified and just basically eats the dead tissue.

628
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:28,399
And he said well if we can just get rid of their xalic acid or turn it way down maybe we'll turn it from a pathogen into a saprified.

629
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:35,399
It'll still be around but talking really damaged trees. So he did he's done that kind of amazing thing. He took a gene from wheat.

630
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:40,399
In fact put it into chestnut and he's appeared to be resistant.

631
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:48,399
So there's a case where genetic engineering was important and it was able to very very quickly do what breeding other techniques couldn't do.

632
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:57,399
And so that's kind of a well known case but then we have lots of other species that are sort of an earlier stages of that same devastation.

633
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:07,399
There's an emerald ash borer, there's hemlocked delgit, a few other things around the world that are in that category what looks really bad for the species.

634
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,399
So from my point of view when you have a crisis like that you want to use all your tools.

635
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:21,399
And genetic engineering is definitely one where you come in you don't say well what genetic variation the tree species has is going to have to be good enough.

636
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:28,399
You say what are all the tools I have and if a guy stayed in University of New York or elsewhere says I think I understand how this pathogen works.

637
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:37,399
Let's take a gene and move it let's tweak a native gene maybe we have we do have some things that are somewhat similar in chestnut but we need to edit it.

638
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:40,399
We need to do crisper to change it.

639
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:50,399
And let's do it fast because this is an emergency to get this out and start testing it right we can't wait for 20 years of regulatory analysis and ecological approval.

640
01:17:50,399 --> 01:18:01,399
But we can't do that. Can't do that today because of the rules and the regulations and people's phobias and the inability of companies to see that they could ever use such a trait.

641
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:04,399
So there's almost no investment in that kind of technology.

642
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:17,399
And to me that makes no sense. That's just that's just you know when you're you know the line between precaution and paranoia.

643
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:22,399
Procution is sort of you know taking intelligent measures to you know look before you leave.

644
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:27,399
Power and oil is being so afraid and building an institutional system that's based on fear.

645
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:32,399
And that's I think that's where our app with genetic engineering and it makes no sense.

646
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:38,399
So you know anyway so I think it could be a powerful technology for the future.

647
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:43,399
All trees could be semi-dwarf in a future time if people were to actually allow that to happen.

648
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:49,399
And maybe they'd be more productive and more stress resistant but we're not going to know in my lifetime if that's true or not.

649
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:57,399
So you know I you know so I think this powerful things we could do that I think the uses would be selective.

650
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:03,399
These really more egregious cases that I mentioned because conventional breeding is very powerful.

651
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:12,399
And there's essentially no limits on it. You could take a species from anywhere in the world and move it here to Oregon and if it works you know it's fine.

652
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:15,399
So that's radical genetic engineering really.

653
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:21,399
And we can do that without any constraints but if you tweak a gene there's these huge constraints and issues.

654
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:25,399
So why mess with tweaking genes when you can do that other stuff.

655
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:30,399
So you know we sort of paint it ourselves into this corner if you want to you know a bit.

656
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:37,399
Graduate students assume come to your lab because they're attracted by your work and want to pursue similar topics.

657
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:45,399
What do you tell them? I mean it it sounds to me like you hit a time period of cultural history I suppose where you can work that you did.

658
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:47,399
Right. But that window is closed.

659
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:58,399
Well I tell them you know I tell them if you think you're going to graduate and get a job in the forest industry doing biotechnology the job opportunities are extremely small.

660
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:10,399
So I tell them you have to be competitive with any agricultural biotechnologist you need to be able to get a job one of those companies or the USDA that's still doing some of this particularly for serious diseases.

661
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:15,399
And you need to have what I call bioinformatics training.

662
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:27,399
Meaning that you know putting the GMO thing aside you need to be able to do state of the computational biology which doesn't involve GMOs because that's the entree to where most jobs are.

663
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:35,399
And the broad area of biotech science. So you know otherwise a lot of them come to me because they're motivated by the things we're talking about.

664
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,399
They want to see the world changed because they see how powerful genetic engineering is.

665
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:46,399
They see all of this information out there including from the good guys and they're angry and they're passionate.

666
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,399
So you know I tell them you know I always write open this is the reality.

667
01:20:50,399 --> 01:21:02,399
So that's what they say but again it's really critical they do state of the artwork. It just happens to be on trees and then they're going to postdoc and they'll be able to move into other areas.

668
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:11,399
A couple of concluding questions that I'm interested in your perspective on change in the college of forestry that changes very visible to everybody right now is it's a big homework.

669
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:20,399
Yeah but tell me how the college has changed and moved in different directions and years of your association.

670
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:34,399
Yeah you know I think we have a great leader and you know Dean Thomas Matt is very visionary who really wants to move the college ahead very powerfully he wants to sort of move into the environmental mainstream if he can.

671
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:49,399
He's trying to build much better bridges with environmental organizations than we've had historically he wants to reduce the polarization we've had amongst the more in pro industry and the pro environment folks and I think that's happening over time successfully.

672
01:21:49,399 --> 01:22:02,399
He wants to move into the advanced you know laminated technologies and this new building that's you know a big part of the money and the push is to do that kind of thing.

673
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:10,399
I think that's really positive colleges also now in different parts of campus and that's heard sort of a sense of unity that we have.

674
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:22,399
So you know I think I think he's trying to set us on the right path and do the right thing and I hope he can bring his vision through the completion but I think that's a set of unknown right now.

675
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:26,399
What kind of impact do you think the new forestry complex might have on the college?

676
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:33,399
Well you know I think new buildings I've been discussing this with various colleagues you know it's obviously a big cost.

677
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:42,399
But you know the environment you live and work in matters it matters to how you feel how you interact with people.

678
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:52,399
I'm in Richardson Hall which was about 15 or 19 years old but it was designed with lots of light lots of wood and it's brought people together.

679
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:58,399
It's been even though it had its own little design flaws we found out keeping out things like rain.

680
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:12,399
You know it's a really beautiful environment and so I think he wants to take that to another level and create really a sense of greenness and collaboration and you know an innovation that I think a new building helps to motivate.

681
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:27,399
So you know I like the idea and I think there was criticism about whether it was green enough and how green you need to be to tear down existing functional building but also quite old fashion and not a great collaborative space at all.

682
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:32,399
Very much in the old model people basically infile cabinets.

683
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:41,399
So you know I think they're not a lot to try to be green while also making it something you can sell to donors.

684
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:48,399
Because donors don't want to invest in you know changing the sighting and existing building if they want to invest in a vision.

685
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,399
And so I think you didn't really have the choice but to create a new building.

686
01:23:52,399 --> 01:24:02,399
So I'm hoping that you know that the dean comes back and the building is as beautiful and as functional as you hope it will be and helps you know bring us to another level.

687
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:09,399
So but right now I think we're in this kind of precarious place where a year or two out I'm happy in that building.

688
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:19,399
And all building projects I know of it cost more than you think and then you have to make difficult decisions as you go and does it actually do everything you thought you were going to do with it.

689
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:24,399
I think there's those risks as well but I'm hoping.

690
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:25,399
Yeah.

691
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:26,399
And my last question a few.

692
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:34,399
This is a sesquicentennial project and I'm interested in your point of view on the university as it looks towards its 150th birthday.

693
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:37,399
What do you think OSU is positioned right now?

694
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:45,399
Yeah I really felt really fortunate to be part of this institution for the 30th and going on my 30th first year that I've been here.

695
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:49,399
I've felt the leadership that I've had in the college of far she's been excellent.

696
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:56,399
John Barr and Ed Ray I think have been you know inspiring and responsible leaders.

697
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:11,399
I have not gotten involved in administration significantly so like every other faculty member I know of I wonder if we are investing far too much given our limited state budgets in administrators they just seem to be everywhere.

698
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:20,399
So I wonder whether every administrator is really needed and what they're doing what their impact is.

699
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:26,399
But in general I like the ethics and the structure of the place and I'm proud to be a part of it.

700
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:35,399
So you know I like the emphasis that we have on equity and diversity here and I think that's really important.

701
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:43,399
Oregon is a very white place and it's a white place for institutional reasons and in my opinion those need to be corrected and addressed.

702
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:48,399
So I'm proud that we're doing that pretty actively we're doing them pretty actively in forestry as well.

703
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,399
So I think that's the right thing to do.

704
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,399
So you know in general I feel good about it.

705
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:04,399
I would love to see more of the administration explaining who they are, what they do and how cost effective they are.

706
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:07,399
And they don't seem to feel they need to do it.

707
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,399
So I don't think that's right.

708
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:24,399
So in that regard you know I would love a little bit more of a business sense of explaining to faculty how they're making smart decisions and what the administrative decisions that they make really cost as compared to you know I don't know

709
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:32,399
could we have 10% less administration 10% or 50% more faculty members doing innovative research and teaching.

710
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:42,399
You know I just those trade-offs I don't understand them and I don't know anybody does because I don't think administrators feel the need to explain them to plebeians like me.

711
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:45,399
And I know I don't like that.

712
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:55,399
Anyway but so in general very positive but you know with some sense that maybe we have some runaway administrative investments and I think that's a common problem in higher education.

713
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:05,399
You know so as far as I understand it so how do you how do you reign that in or how do you at least understand it and decide if you agree with it or not.

714
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:08,399
Yeah certainly not the first time I've heard that.

715
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:27,399
But in short I mean I feel privileged to have been here the community has been an extraordinary place for me to live and raise my children and you know as I when I go back to my yell were unions and those folks are all over the world and they say hey you know you traveled everywhere where where where would be your ideal place to live I always say I'm living there.

716
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:31,399
I travel the world too and this is an incredible place to be.

717
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:36,399
No that's a good enough to stop on thank you very much I really appreciate this.
