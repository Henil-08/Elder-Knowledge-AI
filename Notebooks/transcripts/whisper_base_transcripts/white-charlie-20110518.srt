1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
So we are lucky enough to be here this morning to interview Charlie White and it's May 18,

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
2011.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
It's too late.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,839
I want to start off by just asking you to tell us your earliest recollections, where

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,920
you're born, what year, and where you grew up.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,519
I was born and Detroit Michigan in April 2014.

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,519
I was the youngest of nine children, four brothers and four sisters all over the

9
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,519
first.

10
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:44,519
There two of us left myself and brother next to me.

11
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:51,519
They were typical, we were poor, but I normally said that, it's not really, no, we were poor

12
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,519
because I never starved.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I always said food.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I always said a roof over my head and went to clothes and the whole thing.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
And the old saying was, cardboard and shoe, we had a few, sure, sure.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,520
But I was just a typical childhood in those days.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,520
What kind of things do you remember doing as a child playing games?

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,519
I remember playing sports.

19
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:26,519
My brother, he played basketball and he played in high school.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,519
He didn't go to college, but he played high school.

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,519
I used to watch his games and we'd hit the playgrounds on the weekends.

22
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,519
We'd sat at the morning and had to break a dog.

23
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,519
We were out in the alleys and on the playgrounds playing basketball.

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,519
It was more like a religion, we played all kinds of sports.

25
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,519
And contrary to popular belief, there was pretty good hockey players in my neighborhood.

26
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,519
Being wintertime, we played hockey and we played tennis and all that, but basketball just

27
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,519
became the sport.

28
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,519
Basketball and football, it's a good baseball player.

29
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,519
The basketball became the game of a choice, a not-played YMCA,

30
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,519
a Jewish community center.

31
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:22,519
But also one thing I did when I was 10 years old, 19 years old, I used to swim for the YMCA.

32
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:30,519
And I wasn't too bad, but he transferred closer to a place near my home and everybody left the YMCA.

33
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,519
The coach left and everybody followed him.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,520
We used to swim against the girls' town teams from the country clubs and all that, and we did pretty good.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,520
So swimming was big to me for about three or four years, from about nine to about 13.

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm still playing basketball, but I did, somewhere, I just swimming and then evening at big clubs.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Sure, sure.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
But that's basically what we do.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,520
What do you recall growing up in Detroit around the racialization of Detroit was there.

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You said you swam against the kids in the country club, did you sort of have any kind of feeling towards you guys?

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Well, they did, but nothing was said.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I mean, they just felt, they had that superior feeling that they were better because they had to have much better facilities.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,520
We were at decent facilities, but they had the country clubs and the whole thing.

44
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,520
That feeling was there and it was always there that we wanted to win.

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Detroit was a, I love Detroit, but it was polarized.

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I mean, most of the blacks lived in about three or four different areas and their ties, their tiered, Jewish people lived there,

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
and the Polish people lived on a little place called Amdrami.

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Sure.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
And great athletes came up Amdrami.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,520
And that was like Dindy high schools in Amdrami.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
So we played against each other and throughout the city.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:03,520
But it was mostly, there was only one that I can remember, one school at that time that had mixed athletic teams.

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,520
And that was cast tech, which was one of the top schools in the city.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Roughly what year were we talking about in the mid-50s?

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,519
So your high school, as I'm here, you say, was not this aggregate?

56
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,519
No, well I went to cast tech.

57
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,519
To begin with, but I didn't stay there, I ended up back in my neighbor's school.

58
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,519
But yeah, the neighbor's school that I played the most basketball in was not segregated.

59
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,519
The cast tech was and they always said pretty good teams.

60
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,519
But you know, it was pretty much it.

61
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,519
I did a lot of hard jobs growing up as a kid to generate income.

62
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,519
I learned this from all my brothers and sisters who all worked and went to school and did all the things.

63
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,519
They all graduated from high school and none went to college.

64
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,519
I was the only one.

65
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,519
But I worked for cutting lawns, washing windows, whatever.

66
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,519
And then I got a job with large grocery chain, crocus.

67
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,519
And I started working in the meat department just kind of cleaning up and everything.

68
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:16,519
And then I ended up getting a permanent job as a stock boy and doing okay.

69
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,519
And the job was rough in the neighborhood.

70
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:29,519
I mean, you had to kind of establish yourself, but I decided in 1958 that I didn't see enough.

71
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:36,519
And I turned the mind and I decided to see the school see the world and join the military.

72
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,519
And we could have gone in for two years and gone to the Far East.

73
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,519
But I said now let's go in for three and go to Europe.

74
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,519
I'm sorry, we're going to see a few more places and that's what happened.

75
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,519
Okay.

76
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
And you were about 18.

77
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,519
17, 18, 20.

78
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,519
20.

79
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Almost to a 19.

80
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Thank you so much.

81
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,519
So I started and I played a lot of basketball that was there.

82
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,519
In the military.

83
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,519
Yeah, he talked about that.

84
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,519
Well, we came in and I went in into Ford Noth's.

85
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,519
A little bit right outside, a little bit.

86
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,519
And they had a camp team.

87
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,519
And I went out for it, but I didn't want to have been ordered to make that team.

88
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,519
You had to kind of stay in the states and you travel around and I said,

89
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
no, I don't want to stay here.

90
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,519
I want to go to Europe.

91
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,519
I want to go to Europe.

92
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,519
And I got on the team there and we played, we could be at like 50 game schedules

93
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,519
and then we had to turn them in.

94
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,519
So yeah.

95
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,519
And then I played a lot of games.

96
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,519
enjoyed myself.

97
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,519
You know, we went to went all over Berlin, all over Germany.

98
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,519
Right.

99
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,519
At that time, the military was disagreed.

100
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,519
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
Oh, yeah.

102
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,519
So you were actually working with white teammates.

103
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,519
But there was several racial issues in the military.

104
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,519
Can you talk about them?

105
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Well, the majority of MPs were military police were white and from the south.

106
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,519
Okay.

107
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,519
And they harassed us consistently.

108
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:17,519
Whenever we would be out, there was one African guy there named Bobby,

109
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,519
something other.

110
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,519
And he had a club, a very nice popular club.

111
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,519
And we would go down there and you know, once or twice a month,

112
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,519
MPs would come and just kind of raid the club, you know,

113
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,519
pull everybody out and scoot.

114
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,519
Hang coffee, you know.

115
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,519
And our team used to go down there.

116
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,519
But this was a track team at this time.

117
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,519
Okay.

118
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,519
And we had white kids on the track team and they would tell them to go home

119
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,519
but they wouldn't go.

120
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,519
They would stay with us and they would take us, you know, to jail,

121
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,519
to lock up.

122
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,519
But we'd get out the next couple of hours because we'd call our Colonel

123
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,519
and block out Bob.

124
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,519
You know, it was just a harassment.

125
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,519
Sure.

126
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,519
It was just continued.

127
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,519
Sure.

128
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,519
Yeah.

129
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,519
Sure.

130
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,519
It continued.

131
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,519
What else were some of your experiences in Germany as?

132
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,519
So I mean, what position did you have in the military then?

133
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,519
Because it wasn't just fully accurate, right?

134
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,519
You had a regular job.

135
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,519
Yeah, I was just, I was in the Army infantry what they called it.

136
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,519
But I didn't spend a lot of time.

137
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,519
I spent what they called TDY, which is temporary duty.

138
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,519
And I would play sports.

139
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,519
But I also was on the track team.

140
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,519
Oh, I didn't even know they had to.

141
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:29,519
Now I jumped and triple jumped and brought jumped, mouse long jumped and whatever.

142
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,519
But yeah, I did that too.

143
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,519
So I did that to pretty much keep from, you know, doing the life of it.

144
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,519
Every day, every day.

145
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,519
Every day, every day.

146
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,519
Yeah, right, right.

147
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,519
Kids in Pedro, you know, little sorts of things.

148
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,519
Right.

149
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,519
Right.

150
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,519
Yeah.

151
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,519
So did someone recognize you in the military as being a potential athlete

152
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,519
or eventually college or how did that keep talking to me now about how that was?

153
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
It was really funny.

154
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,519
We were in the gym one day and I was shooting around.

155
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,519
And this kid from Southern California, he's on our team, Jones, Dick Jones.

156
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,519
He came in the gym and he asked me, see what are you going to do?

157
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,519
I was getting close to my time to come back.

158
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,519
Three of his things.

159
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,519
And he said, what are you going to do when you get out of the military?

160
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,519
I said, you know, I really didn't talk much about it.

161
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,519
And he said, you got to go out to California and go to junior college.

162
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,519
And he said, junior college is free.

163
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,519
And then maybe you can get a scholarship to four years school.

164
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,519
And I thought he was joking.

165
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,519
So I threw the ball out and told him to get out of here, you know, chasing him out of the gym.

166
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,519
Well, guess what happened?

167
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,519
Uh-huh.

168
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,519
I did just that.

169
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,519
I did just that.

170
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,519
I got shipped to California from Germany.

171
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,519
Got out of the army, went to junior college, then came with Durgan State.

172
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,519
Oh, okay.

173
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,519
Now, the thing that I noticed when I got here, I started seeing names in the paper

174
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,519
from some of the other junior colleges in Southern California.

175
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,519
Guys, I knew from Detroit.

176
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,519
So there was a lot of young kids kept from Detroit who came out to California and went to junior college.

177
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,519
What was that?

178
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,519
What do you think?

179
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,519
Because we heard some very similar thing from...

180
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,519
No, because he said that a lot of guys from his neighborhood is Washington, ended up in California.

181
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,519
What was maybe going on back then?

182
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,519
Well, for one thing, the junior colleges back there were not free.

183
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,519
Worked free in East Coast.

184
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
East Coast, they were free out here.

185
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,519
Okay.

186
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
If you were 21, you could establish residency and you didn't have to pay out of state fees.

187
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,519
Okay.

188
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,519
So you could go to junior college free.

189
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,519
Oh, you know.

190
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,519
And these coaches would help you get a little odd job here in there where you could work.

191
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,519
Uh-huh.

192
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,519
And then you had to go to scholarship to a four-year school.

193
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,519
Interesting.

194
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,519
So a lot of kids, and plus, you know, who wouldn't want to come to California?

195
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,519
Yeah, that's right.

196
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,519
Detroit, you know what I mean?

197
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,519
It's snow, this is high and freezing.

198
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,519
And there's a lot of different things going on.

199
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,519
And you know, the guys were getting in trouble, friends, relatives, you know,

200
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,519
were in that mix, you know, that you see every day.

201
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:53,519
I mean, when I was about 17, you had to be 18 to go into the pool halls,

202
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
but everybody forwards some kind of paper.

203
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
And I used to hang around in the pool hall and, you know, see a lot of stuff going on.

204
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,519
Sure.

205
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,519
So you want to get away from that mainly?

206
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,519
Yes, you know, just a...

207
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,519
More future.

208
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,519
Yeah.

209
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
Yeah.

210
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,519
And that was, you know, they just got started coming.

211
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,519
Once a couple of guys came, yeah.

212
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,519
A lot of guys started coming.

213
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,519
And like I said, I saw the guys' names down in L.A.

214
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,519
and different places that come to Detroit.

215
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,519
And so I said, yeah, it was the best thing for me to do.

216
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
But anyway, that's what I did.

217
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
I came to Oregon State and, you know...

218
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,519
Sure.

219
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,519
I'm going to come back down to that.

220
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,519
That's good.

221
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,519
So you're playing in a junior college.

222
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,519
And someone identifies you and says, who was that?

223
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,519
You know, Paul and I were talking about that.

224
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
Well, I don't recall who it was.

225
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,519
Okay.

226
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,519
But I think it was a guy that played with Paul.

227
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,519
His name was Doug.

228
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,519
And I don't remember his last name.

229
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,519
I'm not a factor last time.

230
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,519
I think I heard he was in pretty poor health.

231
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,519
But he and Paul played together.

232
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,519
They were good friends.

233
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,519
Sure.

234
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,519
And I think he might have seen me play in some tournament.

235
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,519
He lived in the general area.

236
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,519
And Paul and told him about me.

237
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,519
But one thing that happened, the year before I came,

238
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,519
where Slash's skill came down to recruit me.

239
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,519
In my fight, he came to my house.

240
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,519
And I talked with him.

241
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,519
You know, and I didn't feel good.

242
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,519
Just didn't feel warm and fuzzy, I guess.

243
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,519
And then a couple of other coaches told me some stories about him.

244
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,519
That I probably wouldn't get to play much.

245
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,519
And sitting on the bench and that sort of thing.

246
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,519
And I said, well, that's just not a good sign.

247
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,519
So I just didn't come here.

248
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,519
And then the next year when Paul came down and we sat down and talked,

249
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,519
like I said, I just felt it.

250
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,519
You know, you feel something.

251
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,519
And like I said, when we talked about me graduating,

252
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
I told him I need probably more than two years.

253
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
He said, well, I can't give you that in writing.

254
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,519
But I promise you that you graduate.

255
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
Anything over the two that I need to graduate, I would graduate.

256
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,519
And I felt that.

257
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,519
And then when I came up here, they focused on education right away as opposed to,

258
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,519
you know, just ask about and laid out what I needed to do.

259
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,519
And that's when I started taking classes and got through.

260
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,519
So you come back to your situation with Slash Guild.

261
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,519
At that point, the team was completely not the same.

262
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,519
The team was segregated in a sense.

263
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,519
There was no African-Americans on the team by that point.

264
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,519
But in Southern California, there were actually board teams that were very...

265
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,519
No, sure.

266
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,519
Very mixed.

267
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,519
Sure.

268
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,519
I wonder how, in your opinion, how did he think that he sort of rationalized?

269
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,519
That he wasn't going to allow his team necessarily to have an edge?

270
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,519
Because at that point, I think it was really recognized that having African-American players on your team was really an edge.

271
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:01,519
Because they run a different game to the game that Norma's actually talking to us about the game that he was forced to play.

272
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,519
And that is a very kind of contri...

273
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,519
Sure.

274
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,519
...control.

275
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,519
Control.

276
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,519
It was a completely different game.

277
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,519
Running plays.

278
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,519
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,519
Picking screens.

280
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,519
We were on a playground and it was...

281
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,519
You just got it done?

282
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,519
Yeah, behind the back.

283
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,519
Yeah.

284
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,519
Good legs or whatever.

285
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,519
You know, we were out of here, open them before it came in the college.

286
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,519
Sure.

287
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,519
You know, I really don't know.

288
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,519
I try to figure this out because every year...

289
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,519
Yeah.

290
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,519
...and so I said some good teams.

291
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,519
Yeah, you went to the battle for it.

292
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,519
But every year, almost every year, for two years, specifically, that just spoke his heart, I know.

293
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,519
Okay.

294
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,519
Be a Russell.

295
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,519
Yeah.

296
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,519
Was at USF.

297
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,519
And they always played in the region, it was on the West Coast.

298
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,519
And the West Coast teams used to beat him every time and all of them always had players of color.

299
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,519
Right.

300
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
And I was out to myself.

301
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,519
Yeah.

302
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,519
You know, you know, I don't know.

303
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,519
You know, and you know the thing that they mentioned about the quota thing they had.

304
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
Yeah.

305
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,519
You start one at home, two on the road.

306
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,519
Yeah.

307
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
But be a Russell, calling the phrase, you say, but five when you're behind.

308
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,519
Yeah.

309
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,519
You know, be a Russell, started that.

310
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,519
Now, but I heard another explanation of that.

311
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,519
You start one at home.

312
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,519
Yeah.

313
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,519
And two on the road because you got to have somebody to roam together.

314
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,519
Oh, interesting.

315
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,519
You see that.

316
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,519
Yeah, that's just what I was told.

317
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,519
You know, you wouldn't, you know, at that time.

318
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,519
Yeah, sure.

319
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,519
Yeah.

320
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,519
And also at that time, in some parts of the country, you can find logic for black players.

321
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,519
So, you know, if you had to go play in some areas, you know, this is how to like the old,

322
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,519
when Jackie Robinson was playing baseball, the team stayed here and he found him a place to stay in the neighborhood at someone's home.

323
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,519
Yeah.

324
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,519
You know, like that.

325
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,519
So, I know some coaches had mentioned that and they were aware of that and some thought of, you know, felt uncomfortable with that.

326
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,519
Right.

327
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,519
But I don't, I just don't know.

328
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,519
I think he might have wanted to pull the trigger, but I don't know.

329
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,519
He just did.

330
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,519
Yeah.

331
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,519
And plus there weren't a lot of kids up here for him to recruit and most of his kids were local, though, and then he'd go back and look.

332
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,519
Yeah.

333
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
Now, I think at that time Washington probably had some.

334
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,519
Washington had a African mayor.

335
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,519
He certainly has, yeah.

336
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,519
Yeah.

337
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,519
He's a great thing.

338
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,519
That's why I was wondering when I was doing the research.

339
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,519
Yeah.

340
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
It was to see what was, you know, you saw that California clearly had lost, and you saw, you see Adel had a few.

341
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,519
University of Oregon.

342
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,519
They played them all the time and, yeah.

343
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,519
Yeah.

344
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,519
The guy was kind of holding the line and I was compared to Rupp when I was kind of understanding what was going on.

345
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,519
What was this guy trying to do?

346
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:48,519
But that was the feeling pretty much amongst those, you know, athletes in California and different places that he didn't really want in.

347
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
Right.

348
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,519
But I was really.

349
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,519
Right.

350
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,519
So, and I guess nobody wanted to be the first with him.

351
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,519
Yeah.

352
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,519
Because there was not that good feeling about the weather map, you know, you could be quite afraid.

353
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,519
Yeah.

354
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,519
Yeah.

355
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,519
And so when Paul Valentin came down, did he ever tell you that, hey, I'm going to be the coach next because I know I'm in line.

356
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,519
No, he was actually the coach when he came down.

357
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,519
Oh, he's actually, you know, already got in the job.

358
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,519
You already got in the job.

359
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,519
Oh, I see.

360
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,519
Oh, I see.

361
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,519
Okay.

362
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,519
So you and I had read about it in the paper, but I didn't think much of it really didn't.

363
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,519
He called me.

364
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,519
He contacted me.

365
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,519
Sure.

366
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,519
And then he came to talk to me.

367
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,519
Right.

368
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,519
Right.

369
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,519
Okay.

370
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,519
So let's now carry the story on.

371
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,519
Just talk about you now arriving on campus.

372
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,519
And what were some of your earliest recollections for you?

373
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,519
You were arriving on campus.

374
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,519
You're seeing the plays.

375
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,519
What was that like?

376
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,519
One thing that was really funny.

377
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,519
There was a female named Charlie White.

378
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,519
Name Charlie White?

379
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,519
Yes.

380
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,519
Okay.

381
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,519
All right.

382
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,519
And they put her in one of the men's dorms.

383
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,519
This.

384
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,519
This side.

385
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,519
It's one of the men's dorms.

386
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,519
And I got to meet her later.

387
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,519
Look at her.

388
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,519
I met her at a party.

389
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,519
Really?

390
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,519
Okay.

391
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,519
Yes.

392
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:02,519
When I first got here, they had us doing jobs in cottage groves.

393
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,519
Okay.

394
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,519
Logging.

395
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,519
Logging.

396
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,519
Okay.

397
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,519
So in the office.

398
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,519
Yeah.

399
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,519
But I came at the beginning of summer.

400
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,519
So I went right into work.

401
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,519
Okay.

402
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,519
Now, cottage grove is down toward Eugene.

403
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,519
I think it's east of Eugene out in the wilderness.

404
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,519
Okay.

405
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,519
So they took me down there.

406
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,519
And I mean, this was not a good situation.

407
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,519
Yeah.

408
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,519
The first day I was there took me in the evening.

409
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,519
Yeah.

410
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,519
And I said, well, you being me in the night.

411
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,519
Yeah.

412
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,519
So the next morning I get up and I come down and everybody's staring.

413
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:42,519
And then the next day someone told me that it would be good if I didn't come out at night.

414
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,519
Okay.

415
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,519
So I called Paul and said, I'm leaving.

416
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,519
Yeah.

417
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,519
You know, now.

418
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,519
Yeah.

419
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,519
So they sent somebody and got me.

420
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,519
And I moved in Eugene.

421
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,519
There were some guys in Eugene.

422
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,519
There was three or four guys in this apartment.

423
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,519
And it was, it was mixed with a couple of white students and a couple of, and they were athletes.

424
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,519
And they brought me down there.

425
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,519
And I, and every morning, what we would do, we would catch a bus from Eugene to the cottage grove and working.

426
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,519
And they would come back to Eugene.

427
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,519
So, you know, they'll get the job.

428
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,519
Yeah.

429
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,519
But I didn't live in cottage grove.

430
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,519
Yeah.

431
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,519
And they were just staying.

432
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,519
They need to get me out of here now.

433
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,519
Okay.

434
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,519
So I came to Eugene and then I worked at Summer in the Woods, which was good.

435
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,519
We made a lot of money.

436
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,519
I was going to spend a whole lot, but at that time was a lot of money.

437
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,519
And we did have a place to spend this.

438
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,519
So all of a sudden, along we worked, stuck chicken in the bank.

439
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,519
So we got to school started.

440
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,519
We had a little money.

441
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,519
Right.

442
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,519
It was common for us.

443
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,519
Yeah.

444
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,519
Oh yeah.

445
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,519
We could work.

446
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,519
First we got to stip it.

447
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,519
Okay.

448
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,519
Yeah, monthly stip.

449
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,519
So then, start the season.

450
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,519
And I can say we had a, we didn't have a very good team.

451
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,519
We were seven, seven in the bank.

452
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,519
But actually it wasn't the pack eight.

453
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,519
Everybody says the pack eight.

454
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,519
It was the AAWU.

455
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,519
It was the athletic association of Western universities.

456
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,519
Okay.

457
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,519
But it was the original eight schools to two in Oregon, two in Washington, two in Southern

458
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,519
County.

459
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,519
It was the pack eight.

460
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,519
You know, the name pack eight became, it came on later.

461
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,519
But anyway, we were seven, seven in confidence.

462
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,519
I think we were 14, 10 overall or something like that.

463
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:32,519
And, you know, we, you know, we weren't really thinking anything big the next year.

464
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,519
We just wanted to be competitive.

465
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,519
And I had played small floor with the first year here.

466
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,519
But then they put me in guard the next year.

467
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,519
You know, and all the guys, the only new guy that came in really was, that really helped us with Harry.

468
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,519
The only new guy, Harry Garner.

469
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,519
Okay.

470
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,519
Yeah, he's the only new guy, African American who came in.

471
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,519
Oh, and Lloyd Peterson.

472
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,519
Yeah, I'll take that back.

473
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,519
Lloyd Peterson.

474
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,519
Okay.

475
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:04,519
So they came in and, you know, we, we, we, people like a good seven, eight, and deep, you know.

476
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,519
What year was that when they came in?

477
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,519
Because we didn't find them.

478
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,519
They were 65.

479
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,519
But Lloyd was not African American.

480
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,519
We were very, very good on the watch.

481
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,519
Very good on the watch.

482
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,519
Yeah.

483
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,519
All right.

484
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,519
Yeah.

485
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,519
Okay.

486
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,519
We'll tell you that part of the research I have.

487
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,519
Yeah.

488
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,519
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,519
Okay.

490
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,519
Yeah.

491
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,519
Yeah.

492
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,519
So tell me about that, that reception that you receive, you feel that you receive from the student body in that first year and in the next year.

493
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,519
That you feel?

494
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,519
Well, like I said, you know, I'm oblivious to a lot and I've been a lot of places and, you know, and all of them.

495
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,519
Yeah.

496
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,519
And so, I mean, you sure you got some looks.

497
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,519
Yeah.

498
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,519
And, you know, you know, I just kept going.

499
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,519
You know, I was here to do what I was here to do.

500
00:21:49,519 --> 00:22:01,519
One incident was one of the freshmen players who, I knew, you know, not very well, but, you know, I knew who he was.

501
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,519
He was with his girlfriend and he stopped.

502
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:14,519
And he introduced me and, you see me in the comments, oh, you're the one in my girlfriend's class.

503
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,519
Yes, okay.

504
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,519
And I said the one what?

505
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,519
And she was totally embarrassed and couldn't even answer.

506
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,519
So I just said, I'll see you guys later.

507
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,519
Right.

508
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:30,519
But, you know, that was kind of funny, but, you know, you know, you know, but like I said, most of the kids up here had never been.

509
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,519
And they're back people.

510
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:38,519
So you'll let it all go to school with them or, you know, because I had run into that in the army.

511
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,519
I mean, I was a guy in the army.

512
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,519
He lived mostly southerners who were seen.

513
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,519
They told me they'd seen back from a distance, but, you know, they didn't know, you know.

514
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,519
Wow.

515
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,519
And that was that.

516
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,519
Yeah, they were from the south, living in the middle of small town, Mississippi and places like that.

517
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,519
Right.

518
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,519
And I didn't feel anything in classes.

519
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,519
Classes, street tunes.

520
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,519
Yeah.

521
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,519
Yeah, the professors.

522
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,519
I didn't feel anything.

523
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,519
Teachers or students in the classes.

524
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,519
Yeah.

525
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,519
You know, there was an occasional, yeah, a lot of somebody's car, you know.

526
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,519
I'm okay.

527
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,519
But, yeah.

528
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:20,519
And finding accommodation in Corvallis and recreation in Corvallis, what was that like for you?

529
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,519
Well, the main thing is when I, the house I moved in to when I came down, it was already active

530
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,519
by African-Americans.

531
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,519
Oh, well, I didn't have a problem with that.

532
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,519
And how did you find that?

533
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,519
To the coach.

534
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,519
To the coach.

535
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,519
I think so.

536
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,519
Okay.

537
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,519
Yeah.

538
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,519
The day were football players.

539
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,519
And one was a non-athlete.

540
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
Okay.

541
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Walter Latharich, he's a pharmacist.

542
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,519
Okay.

543
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,519
The only thing that grew up, we always told everybody he played tennis.

544
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,519
He was about five, four, five, five, and he was a little overweight, you know.

545
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,519
But he's one of my best friends.

546
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,519
He's in Cate, he lived in New York and got in Florida now.

547
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,519
But, yeah, they were there.

548
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,519
And then we moved to another house on something like 17th near the Coliseum.

549
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,519
Okay.

550
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,519
And we never had a ball.

551
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,519
We went over there and the lady, you know.

552
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,519
And the rent was 70 bucks a month.

553
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,519
Then there was four of us, sort of 17, 50 of months.

554
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,519
That's not bad.

555
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,519
I was just a little bit of a little fairness in there.

556
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,519
But yeah, I was nice.

557
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,519
Sure.

558
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,519
I never had any problem finding a place.

559
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,519
Even those only two places.

560
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,519
Well, I lived in an apartment down in the kindergarten over the street.

561
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,519
Okay.

562
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,519
But that, yeah.

563
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,519
I never had any problems with that.

564
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,519
Now, in terms of, you mentioned going to parties because I'm a reason you met up Charlie Brown.

565
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,519
I'm sorry, Charlie White, which is the female in a party.

566
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,519
Did you go to parties that were integrated?

567
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,519
Or did you go to, when you had a social life?

568
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,519
Well, all of the time I was here.

569
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,519
Not one white person had been invited me to a party that I would go to recall.

570
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,519
Okay.

571
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,519
Now, I got invited to people's homes to have a drink or some dinner, you know,

572
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,519
staying like that.

573
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,519
But not ever once, teammates or anyone, never invited me to a party.

574
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,519
But we gave a party every weekend.

575
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,519
Okay.

576
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,519
At your place?

577
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,519
Yes.

578
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,519
So, 9th Street.

579
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,519
9th Street at Go-Go is what we call that.

580
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,519
At the time at Go-Go.

581
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,519
Yeah.

582
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,519
So, all of the, obviously, all of the women at our parties were white.

583
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,519
Okay.

584
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:30,519
Well, with the exception of two or three, because there were Carol Smith and there was three or four African Americans, women, kind of one.

585
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,519
I lived here in Corvallis.

586
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,519
There's a couple of ones from LA and another from, forget if there's a sacrament over somewhere.

587
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,519
But the majority of the women were white women.

588
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:52,519
And also, Lloyd Peterson, who's white, he came to one or two of my parties early on.

589
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,519
And everybody knew him.

590
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,519
And nobody, you know, even having the angst, you know, he's from Los Angeles.

591
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:04,519
So, he had been around black people and playing ball and black so he had no problem with that.

592
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,519
And this Charlie White, I guess he found out we were having a party.

593
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,519
She came to one of our parties and introduced us to authors, he was kiddin' the guy.

594
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:16,519
But, you know, we talked a lot of time, I forgot, because he was from somewhere in Oregon.

595
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,519
But, yeah, I met her.

596
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,519
And that was pretty much our parties where, like, we gave parties every weekend.

597
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:31,519
And we would even host other African American American athletes when they came to town.

598
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,519
If they were staying overnight, we'd say, hey, we having a party over here, aren't you guys come over?

599
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
Yeah, I mean, everybody's just to go either side, don't sit.

600
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:46,519
So, they'd come over and we became friendly with all the athletes in the conference,

601
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:52,519
up and down the coast, because when they came up here, we went to Washington.

602
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,519
You know, they host us, hey, you know, blah, blah, blah.

603
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,519
And then, we had a friend from Seattle who got to school there.

604
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,519
So, when we go up there, you know, she would always have us, you know, over to her place and stuff.

605
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,519
Sure.

606
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,519
And we go to Portland every now and then, so.

607
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,519
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,519
What was the relationship like with the police when you guys had these parties?

609
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,519
Was there any kind of...

610
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,519
I don't know, but I don't know.

611
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,519
Our police ever come into our house.

612
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,519
Yeah, I really don't.

613
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,519
Hi.

614
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,519
Yeah.

615
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,519
I don't remember how that's called.

616
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,519
And what about fraternities?

617
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,519
I mean, that's always been a sore point for a lot of students.

618
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,519
Dealing with fraternities.

619
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,519
I think I got some...

620
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,519
I got a feel from a couple of fraternities who they were.

621
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,519
I don't recall, but I wasn't anything I wanted to do.

622
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,519
Yeah.

623
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,519
On any campus.

624
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,519
Sure.

625
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,519
I'd been in the military.

626
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,519
I knew I lived in barracks and all that stuff with guys.

627
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,519
I had my feel of that.

628
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,519
I didn't want to do anymore of that.

629
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,519
I was just sitting on it.

630
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,519
Yeah.

631
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,519
Yeah.

632
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,519
What I'm getting at though is more of the tension that occurs because fraternity boys...

633
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,519
Yeah.

634
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,519
All this seems to be down on athletes.

635
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,519
Yeah.

636
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,519
You know, I've got the negative way.

637
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,519
Yeah.

638
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,519
You know, things that...

639
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,519
But then, I think I got like, see, I feel now about a couple of people maybe invite to something

640
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,519
and I just kind of...

641
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,519
You said that wasn't interesting.

642
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,519
Okay.

643
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,519
Can you now talk to us a little bit about your going through school then?

644
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,519
So you said your classes really well.

645
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,519
What did you end up as a major in how did you sort of then go on from there?

646
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,519
Well, I majored in business administration with the concentration

647
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:29,519
in personnel and industrial relations.

648
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,519
And I came here and I started here in September.

649
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,519
I believe of 64.

650
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,519
And I graduated in December of 67.

651
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,519
That's what it's there for us.

652
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,519
And so I left here in 68, 67.

653
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,519
Okay.

654
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,519
I got a job with the company called Crown Zellerback,

655
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:07,519
which was the largest one of the largest paper manufacturing firms in the West Coast.

656
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:16,519
And I got that through one of the alumni, a guy who had played here with Paul.

657
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,519
And he worked for Crown Zellerback.

658
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:25,519
Now, at that time, affirmative action was big.

659
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,519
Really big.

660
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,519
I mean, yeah, any black college graduate could find a job, you know,

661
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,519
and you know, whether you're qualified or not, and I said to say something,

662
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,519
but anyway, I got a job with Crown Zellerback.

663
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,519
And my specific job was to integrate the workforce.

664
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,519
And that was at this company.

665
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,519
Yeah.

666
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,519
And this was in Antioch, California, which was about as a race as you could get.

667
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,519
Really?

668
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,519
Yes.

669
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,519
Antioch is right next to Pittsburgh, California.

670
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,519
Okay.

671
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:04,519
Now, those two places are all 99.9% of African Americans in that area live in Pittsburgh,

672
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,519
and all the vice living in Antioch.

673
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,519
Well, now I went down there to look for a place to stay.

674
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,519
I'd knock on the door and people would open the door and slam into my face or some wouldn't open the door.

675
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,519
Right.

676
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:31,519
So I went into Pittsburgh, and I found this apartment house over there, which was not very nice place.

677
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,519
But anyway, I got hard to do that.

678
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,519
And I did a pretty good job.

679
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:44,519
I was really interested in when I, you know, they wanted African Americans and they wanted more women.

680
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,519
Okay.

681
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,519
Now, this is a manufacturing facility.

682
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,519
Yes.

683
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,519
Now, they had women working already, but of course, the women could only do certain jobs.

684
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,519
Yes.

685
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,519
Which were working in the factory.

686
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,519
And the factory was packing.

687
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,519
Okay.

688
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:01,519
You know, they couldn't, you know, they couldn't work in shipping.

689
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,519
Got it.

690
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,519
They had one female lift truck driver, maybe two.

691
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,519
They couldn't operate the machines, which paid the most money.

692
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,519
They couldn't do those jobs.

693
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,519
So they were pretty much there.

694
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,519
A little packing the boxes and that sort of thing.

695
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,519
That's the way it was at that time, it's them also.

696
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,519
So, you know, I would hire people.

697
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,519
I would go out in the neighborhood.

698
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,519
I would go out in Pittsburgh where African Americans were Hispanics.

699
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
They didn't have a lot of Spanish working there either.

700
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,519
So I'd go out and I'd get 10 or 12 people to come in.

701
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,519
And at that time, they used to do all this different testing.

702
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,519
The wonderlake, the Minnesota money, the factory, the PMNPI, that took forever.

703
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,519
All of that crap.

704
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,519
Yeah.

705
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:49,519
You know, and you know, so anyway, we got ready at some point, but I have 12, 15 people in the room taking this test.

706
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,519
You know, and helping them with it because I'm trying to get people in there.

707
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,519
And then I started doing that.

708
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,519
And I'll tell you the people who at that facility, they hated every bit of it.

709
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,519
Now, there were probably 10 or 12 black people working there.

710
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,519
And they had been working there for quite some time.

711
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,519
I mean, they weren't for a few people.

712
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,519
Yeah.

713
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,519
The honestly they had out of black person probably in the last 10 years or so.

714
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,519
But I started filling them up with African Americans, Hispanics, and females.

715
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,519
Right.

716
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,519
And they hated the world.

717
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,519
They stopped as people there.

718
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,519
They hated it.

719
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,519
And I think people out to the department to supervise them.

720
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,519
And the workers were just stared at me.

721
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,519
I got some bad meal in my inbox, you know, about affirmative action.

722
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,519
And one guy was going to put a George Wallace bumper sticker on my car and somebody stopped him.

723
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,519
You know what I mean?

724
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,519
It was bad.

725
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,519
It was bad.

726
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,519
I want to come back though, because I forgot one for you.

727
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,519
Part of your story, you actually got elected as an award here.

728
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
It was called the Leadership Award when you got it.

729
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
I think it was 65, 66.

730
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,519
Yeah.

731
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,519
The way it voted you was when I got that.

732
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,519
I felt great.

733
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,519
Yeah.

734
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,519
Tell me about what happened.

735
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,519
Oh, what happened?

736
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,519
Well, it probably made me the captain.

737
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,519
Okay.

738
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,519
What was that like?

739
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,519
I didn't, you know, I surprised me.

740
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,519
Okay.

741
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,519
And I didn't feel any angst from the team.

742
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,519
I wasn't a yellow or a screamer anyway.

743
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,519
Not like, go on, just go on with the yellow.

744
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,519
But I would tell guys, you know, and we would have dialogue.

745
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,519
You wouldn't, you know, even give me a stage you did that.

746
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,519
You know, we would, I want to do this.

747
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,519
Why don't you do that?

748
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,519
And when they come down here, let's make sure that we do this.

749
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,519
Sure.

750
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,519
Yeah, that was it.

751
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,519
You know, it wasn't like, I'm this and you got to do it.

752
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,519
Yeah, it was just like that.

753
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,519
We need to stop these guys and this is what we need to do.

754
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,519
And Paul used to always say, excuse me in the huddle,

755
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,519
he'd say this, this, and this.

756
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,519
And then as we broke the huddle, he would always say,

757
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,519
what you got to play the situation.

758
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,519
Because it may not come that way.

759
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,519
So you got to be waiting for it.

760
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,519
And that's what I say, too.

761
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,519
Yeah.

762
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,519
They may not go that way.

763
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,519
They may come this way.

764
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,519
They come this way.

765
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,519
We'll do this.

766
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,519
So, yeah, and I feel good about that.

767
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,519
Yeah, I really did.

768
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,519
Yeah.

769
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,519
And he felt good about it, too.

770
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,519
Paul and I had a real special relationship.

771
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,519
Yeah.

772
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,519
That's making the captain.

773
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,519
But more interesting, you reflect on the student leadership award

774
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,519
that you won.

775
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,519
Was there a leadership award?

776
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,519
No, it was a leadership, I think, was just with the team.

777
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,519
I think Paul's one of the best.

778
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,519
Okay.

779
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,519
Sure.

780
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,519
Let's come back then to your, at the company in Antioch.

781
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,519
So was that your job you continued on with or you said

782
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,519
they were doing?

783
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,519
Well, I did that for a while.

784
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,519
And then I wanted to learn some more about the business.

785
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,519
So I took a production job.

786
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,519
Okay.

787
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,519
And, well, let me go back a little bit.

788
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,519
Yeah, I just, yeah, you go.

789
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:11,519
When I was bringing these people in to go to work, they had what they call a probationary period.

790
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,519
For these people.

791
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,519
For the new employees.

792
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,519
For the new employees.

793
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,519
Which were only 30 days, which is not a lot of time.

794
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,519
But they were terminating these people as fast, almost as fast as I can.

795
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:29,519
After two, two, three weeks, almost 30 days up and they just said, well, they can't do

796
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,519
the job.

797
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,519
Right.

798
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,519
Now, I said, well, wait a minute, something's wrong.

799
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,519
So, a Hispanic gentleman named Leo Mijadis, I don't remember him.

800
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,519
He and I used to talk and he came to me and said, you know, they're not giving these guys a chance.

801
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,519
Yeah, they're not training them right.

802
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,519
So after 30 days, these people can't do the job.

803
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,519
They're kicking them out.

804
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,519
Right.

805
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,519
So we got to do something.

806
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,519
I said, well, he was a union student also.

807
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,519
So I said, I'll tell you what we're going to do.

808
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:03,519
We said how we made up a form that had to be filled out every week.

809
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,519
Right.

810
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,519
The supervisor.

811
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,519
Right.

812
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,519
What was taught to this just, you know, and this person, male, female, whatever, had to agree.

813
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:19,519
So at the end of the week, we would sit out with the union steward, myself, and the department supervisor,

814
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,519
not the guy who trained him at department supervisor, and go over that.

815
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,519
And that guy said, nobody told me this, nobody told me that.

816
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,519
Then we could extend this probation period and then we made sure they got the correct training.

817
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,519
Right.

818
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,519
We did that on a weekly basis.

819
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,519
Took all the time, but we did it.

820
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,519
Right.

821
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,519
And we kept starting me and able to retain people because, you know, hiring people, because of my

822
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,519
work, and you sent them for physicals, you spend money, and then they kick them out.

823
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,519
Right.

824
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,519
So we did that.

825
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:52,519
But then I wanted to expand and so I went out in production, work production, for a while,

826
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,519
shift, work, plus production paid a little more money.

827
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,519
And then I was learning a little more about the business.

828
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:07,519
And then the safety manager left.

829
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,519
And I decided, you know, I had enough of shift work.

830
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,519
And I decided to go back into the personnel office since I got my pay scale up.

831
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,519
And I went back in as the safety manager.

832
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,519
Now I worked there for eight years, and, you know, doing all this time.

833
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:28,519
And then I had an opportunity to go with a large construction firm called Lone Star Industries,

834
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:38,519
which was covered five states, California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Hawaii.

835
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,519
Oh, okay.

836
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,519
So you still often get a job?

837
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,519
Yeah.

838
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,519
And I was regional safety manager, which was a big job.

839
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,519
So then I had, you know, to get your car and all that stuff, you get to travel a lot.

840
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,519
So I took that job.

841
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,519
Did you have a family, at that point, or you were still?

842
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,519
Yeah, I had one son.

843
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,519
You had something like that.

844
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,519
I had a son in 1970.

845
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,519
Okay.

846
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,519
And I had a lot of work to do.

847
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,519
Did you ever have any aspirations to be in coach?

848
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,519
Because I mean, after you leave basketball, I mean, a lot of guys kind of me have that aspiration saying,

849
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,519
hey, you know what, I can probably do some of this stuff.

850
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,519
Well, you know, I did a, I told, I told Coach that freshman here a little bit, you know,

851
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,519
and right after I stopped playing.

852
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,519
Okay.

853
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:25,519
And I guess the reason I didn't stay in coaching, I wanted to get back to California, really.

854
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,519
And so I thought the quickest way for me to get back was to pursue my degree.

855
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:37,519
But otherwise, I thought about it after, it's not right after, maybe 10 years after.

856
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,519
But I was very disappointed when Paul quit.

857
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,519
1970.

858
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,519
Yeah.

859
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,519
1970.

860
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,519
He only had to head coaching down for six, seven years.

861
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,519
Right.

862
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,519
And he just gave it up.

863
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,519
Paul was pretty disappointed.

864
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,519
Did you ever talk to him about why that was?

865
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,519
Because we didn't.

866
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,519
Well, yeah, I don't know that he'd want to.

867
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,519
Okay.

868
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:55,519
Well, that's okay.

869
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,519
Sure.

870
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,519
All right.

871
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:03,519
Now, in terms of your connection back to Detroit, it sounds like that got severed a long time ago.

872
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,519
Oh.

873
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,519
Meaning that you never really went, how'd that aspiration go back there?

874
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,519
No, not to live.

875
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,519
No.

876
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,519
You kept your family back there.

877
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,519
Oh, yeah.

878
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,519
In terms of, yeah.

879
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,519
But what happened is, five or six of my nieces and nephews came to California.

880
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,519
Oh.

881
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,519
But only one stayed.

882
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,519
Okay.

883
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,519
They all came, one went to Los Angeles.

884
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,519
They stayed a while, they don't have a one stayed.

885
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,519
They're still in California.

886
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:26,519
But they all rest on one back to Detroit.

887
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:32,519
But, yeah, yeah, my family, other than my nephew, here is the, they're all in Detroit.

888
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,519
Okay.

889
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,519
And so you do make regular.

890
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,519
Yeah, I do.

891
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,519
Went back last year, twice.

892
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,519
So this year, just recently, when I was in Las Vegas, my nephew graduated.

893
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,519
So a bunch of them came out.

894
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,519
So we had a nice little family reunion last week.

895
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,519
Yeah.

896
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,519
So I'm going back in August.

897
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,519
One of my nieces is getting married.

898
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,519
So I'm going back for that.

899
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,519
But I'm going to be out of here before a winner.

900
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,519
I know you're feeling good.

901
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,519
Yeah, I went back last September and stayed two weeks.

902
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,519
Yeah, okay.

903
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,519
Yeah.

904
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,519
Yeah.

905
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:08,519
Carry on the story a little further than you finished working eight years or so you said as in any

906
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,519
other thing.

907
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,519
Yeah.

908
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,519
Then you said you want to do the supervisor position where you were first known.

909
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,519
Regional.

910
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,519
Regional.

911
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,519
What else did you have to ask that?

912
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,519
Well, I worked that for a while.

913
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:22,519
And then that company got bought up and they downsized and everything.

914
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,519
So I went to work for a shopping mall.

915
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,519
I was the safety director and large shopping mall.

916
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:32,519
I've been near San Francisco.

917
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,519
And I worked there for quite a few years.

918
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:41,519
And then I got into contract security.

919
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,519
I ran the contract security firm in Oakland.

920
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:51,519
I mean the branch manager there for 12 years.

921
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,519
Okay.

922
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,519
And then just before I was thinking about retiring, I went to work for Bayer.

923
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,519
Bayer come back to us.

924
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,519
Yes.

925
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:05,519
And I worked for them in Berkeley for two years and then I finally retired.

926
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,519
2004.

927
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,519
Okay.

928
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,519
But then I got bored.

929
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,519
Okay.

930
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,519
So 2006 rolls around.

931
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:16,519
I'm at home and I look across the street and I see these kids playing basketball over there.

932
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:20,519
It was a school for mentally challenged youth.

933
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,519
So I went over there.

934
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,519
Yeah.

935
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,519
They had basketball.

936
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,519
I see what they were doing.

937
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,519
And there were people there were nice.

938
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,519
And they talked me in the driving the school bus.

939
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,519
Yeah.

940
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,519
Because these guys were pretty hard.

941
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,519
They had a lot of female drivers and these guys said they were tough holding the women.

942
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,519
So I did have a three and a half years and I enjoyed it so much.

943
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,519
And then I tried not to escape it.

944
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,519
Yeah.

945
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,519
Yeah.

946
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,519
Now coming back to playing ball, or not just playing ball, but after you left Oregon State

947
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,519
and you ever sort of just played or keep working out or any of those kind of things with ball.

948
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,519
Oh, I played.

949
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,519
Yeah, I played.

950
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,519
They're not the A.U.

951
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,519
But I played for different teams all over the Northern California.

952
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,519
Yeah.

953
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:08,519
We had quite a, there's quite a, quite a network of teams.

954
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,519
Sacramento, you used to have to march your dime's tournament.

955
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,519
Lake Tahoe had a tournament.

956
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,519
They had a tournament down below Monterey in a little small town called Gonzales, which was a bird.

957
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,519
But it was a real popular tournament.

958
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:24,519
A lot of extra college players.

959
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,519
You'd see them all the time.

960
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:26,519
They'd go down there.

961
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,519
You know, somebody would call me in the middle of the week and say, hey, we got a game up in Sacramento.

962
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,519
And I'd jump in my car after work in the Sacramento and I were in half a way.

963
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,519
And I'd go play.

964
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,519
Yeah, I played a whole lot.

965
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,519
I don't remember when I stopped playing organized, but I played a lot.

966
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,519
Right, yeah.

967
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,519
What's the hard nut to play?

968
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:45,519
I mean, yeah.

969
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,519
I mean, it was just something I did.

970
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,519
Yeah, yeah.

971
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:55,519
And so, you know, whoever I went, you know, for one of the first things I did was find I'm wearing a guy's play ball.

972
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,519
And I went over there.

973
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:04,519
And I went to work down and, I mean, even he got out of college, but he had a company team down there.

974
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:08,519
And he had a lot of large companies around there.

975
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:14,519
DuPont, Dow, American, US Steel, you know, stuff like that.

976
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,519
They all had teams.

977
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,519
And we played a good league and we played in that league.

978
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:19,519
And it was good.

979
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,519
We had a lot of fun doing that.

980
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:22,519
No, you were in Annie.

981
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,519
I can, those teams were mostly integrated.

982
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:33,519
And we never had any incidents that were playing ball, but, you know, trying to

983
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,519
do something in town initially.

984
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,519
It took a while before they loosened up.

985
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,519
And I got to meet several policemen down there.

986
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,519
And I used to hang out at the cop bar, so.

987
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,519
Oh, okay.

988
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:47,519
You know.

989
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:54,519
Yeah, so everything was cool, you know, because some of the, I had hired some of the policemen's kids.

990
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:55,519
Oh, to be okay.

991
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,519
And to wear our work for the summers, you know, they worked in, oh yeah.

992
00:43:58,519 --> 00:43:59,519
Oh, yeah.

993
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,519
Yeah, they worked in, and so, you know, it was pretty good.

994
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:04,519
Right.

995
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,519
Now looking back on Levy, Oregon State, did you ever have any aspirations going on to play

996
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,519
pressure ball?

997
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,519
Well, I did.

998
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,519
I wanted to play, but I didn't get drafted.

999
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,519
And I didn't want to go take a chance and not make it.

1000
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:21,519
And then I'm not having to any school yet.

1001
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:22,519
Okay.

1002
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:26,519
Now, they had the teams that they have now all over the world.

1003
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,519
Yes.

1004
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,519
And they got a team, they have teams everywhere.

1005
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,519
Yeah, they sure did.

1006
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:41,519
I probably could have gotten jobs away, because my nephew went down and played in Argentina for 13 years.

1007
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:42,519
So, yeah.

1008
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,519
So I could have brought, but that wasn't available to us at the time I came out.

1009
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,519
And I probably would have jumped at that.

1010
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,519
Right.

1011
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,519
If I knew that I could go, you know, play for a couple of years in Europe or someplace and make a little money.

1012
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:55,519
You know, could I could come back and finish?

1013
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,519
Yeah, yeah, but you really put school to the party, which is a great thing.

1014
00:44:58,519 --> 00:44:59,519
Yeah.

1015
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,519
Yeah.

1016
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:01,519
Yep.

1017
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,519
You thought, is there any questions you want to ask?

1018
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,519
At this point, because I think we're sort of at the end of what I had to ask.

1019
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,519
Anything that you can think of from the archive perspective that you wanted to ask?

1020
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,519
Well, you mentioned Harry Gunner.

1021
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,519
So when he came on the team, it was the 65, 66 season.

1022
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,519
Was that change the dynamic at all?

1023
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,519
Was that nice to have another?

1024
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,519
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,519
I'm just nice to have him.

1026
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,519
Plus, he helped us a lot.

1027
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,519
He's the size and strength.

1028
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,519
He didn't start, but he played a lot.

1029
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,519
Yeah.

1030
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,519
He was our sixth man and he was the first guy out of the bitch usually.

1031
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,519
And yeah, it's really funny.

1032
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,519
Harry and I didn't always room together.

1033
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,519
So, you know, because sometimes, lo and I used to room together most of the time.

1034
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,519
But you could always find the three of us in one of our bedrooms.

1035
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,519
You know, because we were close.

1036
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,519
Yeah, I'm right used to hang with us.

1037
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,519
Good Lord, didn't loy hated this place.

1038
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,519
Oh, he hated every bit of it.

1039
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:03,519
Right.

1040
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,519
Coming from Los Angeles, he was one of those players that played, he was a playground player.

1041
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,519
Sure.

1042
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,519
Because he'd been playing with back kids all his life.

1043
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,519
And he was a playground player.

1044
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,519
He had more moves.

1045
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:15,519
I'm telling you the canon world, as I say.

1046
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,519
And he could play.

1047
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:17,519
Right.

1048
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:19,519
But he and Paul, man, they just didn't.

1049
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,519
They never got together for his three years here.

1050
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,519
Wow.

1051
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,519
Interesting.

1052
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,519
And now, he went on to play professional.

1053
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,519
Oh, he did.

1054
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,519
They played in Chicago over several years, yeah.

1055
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,519
And then he finally, now, he married a girl from Madras, Oregon.

1056
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:34,519
Oh, did you know that?

1057
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:35,519
Okay.

1058
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,519
But he hated Oregon.

1059
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:44,519
And when he came up here and now, and he hated, he had Paul just never, they never got along.

1060
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:45,519
Never.

1061
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:46,519
Yeah, yeah.

1062
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,519
I mean, they were glad at each other in practice and on the bench, but, yeah, it was just, yeah.

1063
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,519
And it was a hell of a player.

1064
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,519
Right.

1065
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,519
Yeah.

1066
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:00,519
Now, in the movie glory road, there was actually eventually some tension that occurred between the players.

1067
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,519
Mm-hmm.

1068
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:02,519
Just about black and white history.

1069
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,519
Black players getting base all the black players taking their jobs.

1070
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:06,519
Sure.

1071
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,519
Did you ever get any kind of feeling like that?

1072
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:09,519
No.

1073
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:10,519
No.

1074
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:11,519
No.

1075
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:12,519
We were just so few anyway.

1076
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:13,519
Yeah.

1077
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:14,519
Well, first it was just piece.

1078
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:15,519
Yeah.

1079
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:16,519
I never did it.

1080
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:17,519
I never got any feel.

1081
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:18,519
I've never felt that anywhere.

1082
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,519
And I, nobody, definitely ever said it to me right there.

1083
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,519
Yeah.

1084
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:24,519
Yeah.

1085
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,519
Anything else?

1086
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,519
Well, I want to thank you very, very much.

1087
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:30,519
Okay.

1088
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,519
It's a great interview and it lasted exactly almost 45 minutes.

1089
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,519
Yeah.

1090
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:34,519
Great stuff.

1091
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,519
So we really appreciate that.

1092
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,519
Okay.

1093
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:37,519
I got to go pick up Paul.

1094
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:38,519
I know he's probably chomping it a bit.

1095
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:39,519
Okay.

1096
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,519
Well, I'm pretty sorry about the other one going on with others.

1097
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,519
Yeah.

1098
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:43,519
Okay.

1099
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,519
Yeah.

1100
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:45,519
Can I give you his back?

1101
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,519
Sure.

1102
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:47,519
Give it to me.

1103
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:48,519
Sure.
