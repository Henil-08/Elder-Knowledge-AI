1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay, Dr. Bell, if you would please introduce yourself for the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
you name and today's date and our location.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
David Bellott and today is July what?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
July 9th.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, July 9th.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
2014 and we're located at my place on the Portable in Cabin.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Terrific.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What's the start of the beginning?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're born in Grinch, Connecticut.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Grinch, Connecticut?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Grinch, Connecticut, 1938.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And were you raised there?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was raised there pretty much.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You have my whole life until I went to college.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can you tell us about sort of your experience of Grinch growing up?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, Grinch is an interesting place.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a powerful place.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A lot of millionaires.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We were one of my dad was principal of high school.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I went to the same high school.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I think I really learned about leadership.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He was very good.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He said if you spend more than 50% of your time in your office,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
you're not doing your job.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So as a student, he knew what was going on.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was amazed.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
None of the students ever gave me any hassle.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They said he was tough but he's fair.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And he learned all sorts of things.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And he did this by getting down to the trenches.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean, he'd go down the boiler room and just talk with the maintenance people.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He'd talk with the people serving up food and cafeteria.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And he wouldn't ask him for anything.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They would just tell him because they were part of the team.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I learned that kind of leadership from him.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Unfortunately, we don't see that kind very often.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What were your parents' backgrounds?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My dad was a physicist.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to Yale.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And he became high school principal and physical physics teacher.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And my mother was a pianist at the concert pianist.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She died when I was four.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I can still remember sitting under the piano while she practiced.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And we did quite a bit of camping.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And my dad ran some of our camps for churches, Lutheran Church.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I wanted a lot about nature then.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I respect the nature from these big camps.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And I had a lot of these.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And their idea for helping kids was to get them into nature.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And that's what they did.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I had that background.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And my beginning of environmental concerns came out of the church background in the summer camps.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did you have any siblings?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I had three sisters.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And older sister.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And two younger sisters.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And how was the household managed after your mother passed?

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, my father remarried several times.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And I just treated it as a normal household.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He was a very good mentor.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And he had male friends who ran these summer camps.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I had an analogue who was quite a doer.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I never thought that women couldn't do anything men could do.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because my aunt, my aunt, obviously could.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So they just never occurred to me.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so that was the household.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We sort of in the country, not quite like this.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But spent a lot of time outdoors.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That was good.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What were your interest as a boy besides being outdoors?

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How doors, building tree huts?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I guess that was it.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I wasn't into, I played sports, but not, you know, not really that much.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So just hanging around about doors and doing stuff, I guess.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did you enjoy school?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was not particularly in high school, a great student.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Like most kids at age, I enjoyed seeing my friends and seeing my friends and that's what I did.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So what were your first inclinations towards science or engineering?

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, I don't know.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think I was always, I want to do something.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And so I don't think I really, I mean, I was pretty good at science.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was interesting.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Engineering seemed more like you were going to do something.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I just sort of, it wasn't any big decision.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I did decide to go to the Virginia Military Institute, which anybody knows is a pretty tough place to go, particularly that first year you're a rat.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We'll take me through the process of making that decision.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why, why VMI?

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, VMI, I guess I say it's tough.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I look around a lot, you know, when you're growing up, kids, boys, at least.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's a matter of can't you take it, a place sort of those games and you think, well, when I get older, I don't have to play those games.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As I get, as I got older though, I saw a lot of men were playing those games.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Same thing.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean, I see it all the time at Oregon State University, people getting caught up and afraid to speak up.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I said, I'm just going to go there.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then, you know, it's tough.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And if anybody says, what's the matter?

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can't you take it?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll just laugh at him.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I mean, you go through the rat line.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's pretty tough.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I think that was the way I thought of it.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And it generally worked that way.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was tough.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And you saw as a challenge that you wanted to take on.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was a challenge, that's right.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I saw it as a challenge to take on.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I wasn't planning career military.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I wasn't looking for a disciplined life.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It was a challenge.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I think the MI's nurtured that.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, he's had a Maverick spirit.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Very rigid, tough discipline, but there was always.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There was a tension there, a creative tension.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And so I thought of the word challenge as a positive word.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And something's challenging.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, my eyes light up on.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
OK, what are we going to do about it?

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it was a good education.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Class sizes were about 2022.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I had some pretty remarkable people there.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Jonathan Daniels was a martyr in the civil rights movement.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And he was a seminary student when he left the MI,

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
become an Episcopal priest.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And he got killed there.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That really jolted the South, unfortunately.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, Jonathan had to give his life forward.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But he was quite a person.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He's a valvictorian of our class.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, what was the environment like it be in my, especially that first year?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, the first year you're a rat.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
At first year, you're on the go all the time.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's physically and mentally demanding.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It can cycle logically demanding.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But all your classmates are in the same boat.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So it's not like they're picking on you.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, you're all in it together.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And there are times when you say, well, they can't kill me.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And this isn't going to last forever.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And somehow that would get you through.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I thought of that years later, in terms of racial prejudice,

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
because people can't say that.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They couldn't say that.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And when I went back to one of my reunions,

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
one of the most impressive things that happened to me.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There was an older guy there that was a maintenance person.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And he was black.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I told him what year I was there.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I think he says, well, that's when he began.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And he comes in and gives me this big hug

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and we're celebrating together.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it felt really good.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It really did.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And they've integrated down there,

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
because it was not integrated when I'm like there.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And they've done a really good job.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And there's men and women down there now.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And so not integrated as in it was white.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And you were there were white classes of white classes.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was almost all white.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think probably was all white.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And just in the south that, you know,

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
as people just didn't even think of it.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And Jonathan did.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He gave his life for it.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, when they decided when they,

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
they figured, man, this is a serious problem.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They really set out to correct it.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And they really did.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And we've had some remarkable graduates, white end black,

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and patient and so on.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It was, you know, I would say turning point in my life.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean, to see that change is wonderful.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What else was expected of students there besides the coursework?

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, you had physically demanding.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And of course, you first year, you're harassed.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean, you're in the rat line.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're a rat.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And you're on the go all the time.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And so it's hard to describe.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, the Marines respect it.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I've had several Marines say, yeah, it's tough.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And for a Marine, that's probably about the best compliment you can get.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And it's mutual.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean, that's a lot of physical training and military drilling, I see.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, there's not a particularly a lot of drilling.

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You had parades that you did and you marched and you were uniforms.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the academics were very good.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And classes were small.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And there were, you know, they were academically very good.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's just tough schedule.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Physically demanding.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I mean, if you got a chance to take a nap, you'd lay down for 15 minutes and go to sleep and wake up and start all over again.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But during the day, you didn't even have your beds down.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And you rolled up the mattresses there up against the, you know, rolled up.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And we called it a hay rack.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That was leaned against the wall.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And even it was, it was pretty rigid.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But you'd always had sort of a maverick spirit to it.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, when night we tried it, we put the evening gun.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I don't know, 90 millimeter hours are in the PX.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, snuck out there.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I mean, there'd be things you'd sort of do that way.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And things, things would happen.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it was, you learn some things like pulling rank.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's really bad.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, if you, somebody does something.

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, you got ranking.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Of course, you know, a dean or a president has to do things.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Every responsibility, we all know that.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But if they do something, and it's only because I got the rank.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's pulling rank.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And that's not looked on pretty well.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In fact, they'd have a parade.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And in the parade, there'd be a flanking movement.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The troops here, companies have been told in circles.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Going online.

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And the officer was a kid at officer.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But being a front with a saber marching in the front.

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And there would be tack officers grading the lines.

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, if he had pulled rank, those lines would just go like this.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then he'd get chewed out.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So they, you know, if you pulled rank, we throw lines.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I mean, it was, it was just pulling rank was not,

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
not considered a particularly good thing.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I see more of it going on at Oregon State University.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And people sort of accepting it.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's the part that drives me nuts.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, someone says something.

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It does something that doesn't make sense.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
People like and courteous, but tell them.

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A lot of times they, you know, they may get upset.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But they really, the best ones know they need to not hear that.

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But I've seen just too many people with this blank face.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just don't say anything.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't do it.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, I mean, how your academic life sort of evolved while you're at EMI?

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I actually got better grades and college than I did in high school.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I ended up with a civil engineering degree.

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I, you know, I don't know whether I had any career aspirations of that.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It was like you're entering a big open space.

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You know, you're entering the future.

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I didn't have an agenda.

244
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What I wanted to do, what I wanted to be.

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I wanted to do something.

246
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do something interesting.

247
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I was more scouting sort of explore.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I guess, and I think at the EMI,

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think they encouraged that.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You'd ask questions in class.

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I thought it was a good education, not a way.

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And there were bad teachers, yeah.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But they always are.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But you learned from them, too.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So yeah.

256
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, you took that education in your first job as with the Division of Indian Health.

257
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes, public health service.

258
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Right.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The US Public Health Service Indian Health, and I went to New Mexico and loved it.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And it was sanitary engineers that called them.

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And we put in water and sewer systems in Indian pueblos.

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And I bring in translators.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then I got transferred to state of Washington.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It was kind of funny because they said, well, there's a project that has a little bit of a problem.

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Any time a government agency says we have a little bit of a problem.

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That means it's a disaster.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So when I got up there, the project engineer, it wasn't either there.

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And it turns out that some wanted to punch them out.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And after listening to the stories, I began to understand why.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But yeah, we got the project lined up.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But even there, there were some things you had to do.

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Like they didn't have enough parts to keep the cruise busy.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, if you look at the government procedures, it takes months to get the parts.

274
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Your budget's going to be gone.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Or either that or you have to lay off the crew.

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And so I just went out and told them, wrote a memo and said,

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm going to go and buy some parts wholesale.

278
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And if this is a problem, please call me.

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And then I stayed away from the phone.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So I got the parts.

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And they were upset because they probably could have saved $30 by going through the GAO or no GSA.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But the loss of money for the crew.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I mean, you did things like that.

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'd love the crew.

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I love the construction.

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
A lot of funny stories they tell me.

287
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And how do good time?

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's good.

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What sort of impact did the living in Indian country make on you?

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, I actually, in Albuquerque, I was living in Albuquerque.

291
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I go on the reservation.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And in the state of Washington, I live off reservation.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But it was more in the state of Washington, more like rural country.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I loved the culture, loved the dances.

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And it was a really good experience for me.

296
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So I sort of participated in it.

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I mean, broke my wrist riding rodeo.

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So I had a little bit of some good stories to tell.

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So that was good.

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What did you think of the Pacific Northwest?

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I see that was your first exposure to it.

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I only, I was up in the state of Washington.

304
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I did drive through Oregon.

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then I went over to the coast.

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the thing that impressed me the coast was it was hard to get down to the beach.

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There were some really longs.

308
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean, or just longs all over the place.

309
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And of course, now there aren't.

310
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I think there were a lot of wasteful timber practices back then.

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And longs were just drift out.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But I really didn't.

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I was in Eastern Washington.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And so it's quite different than Carvalas.

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I mean, I liked it.

316
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I liked the beautiful country.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, after a year or two, I think with that job, you went back to school.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I spent a little over a year or two years in public health service.

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then I went back to New York University.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Right in the middle of New York City.

322
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What it changed.

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, holy.

324
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm out in the sticks and my palms and a cast from the radio accident.

325
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm ending up ending up in New York, middle of New York City.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But I did get a good education there at New York University.

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I got into computer modeling.

328
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And this was back in the mid-60s.

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I got into that.

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Fort Tran was pretty new then.

331
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I did sort of learn machine language, which was awful.

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Fort Tran, though, was great.

333
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I had a very good major professor.

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I got into computer simulation long before most people.

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There were no PCs back then.

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And there was no internet.

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I used to take cards down on the subway to the Greenwich Village.

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's where the Cron Institute of Mathematics was.

339
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And they had a big computer then.

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You'd give them the cards and they'd run it.

341
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then you plot by hand the results.

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But you got to understand what a model does because you plot them by hand.

343
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You did them yourself.

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You could actually see what was going on in the computer.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And now a lot of people don't see that.

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They really don't understand that.

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And consequently, I think there's a lot of misuse of computer models now.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What's the things we're modeling?

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Lakes and estuaries.

350
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the thing about estuaries is they're part of the river that's influenced by the ocean.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And the tides come in and out.

352
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They're very dynamic systems.

353
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Waters changing.

354
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And so before the digital computer, you had to make mathematical assumptions of steady state.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And the sanitary engineers have been doing this since 1925.

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When I'm rivers building mathematical models long before the scientists were doing it.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And actually the rivers got better.

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They did a lot.

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There was a lot of good.

360
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And that's sort of been airbrushed out of the history.

361
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We may come back to that later.

362
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because there was a lot of environmental improvements on rivers in particular that occurred there.

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I was part of that history.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But the 60s things were changing.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We knew things were changing.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We saw lakes were having problems.

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So all sorts of problems.

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And so that was a real era of transformation.

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When I got here, the computer and the pre-exciting time.

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Was this also your first experience of teaching?

371
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, my first experience in teaching formally.

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I used to help.

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I used to do some help sessions for some of my classmates back at me and my family has a lot of teachers.

374
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And so I loved it.

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So I loved the students and teaching.

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I like the research.

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't like proposal writing.

378
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We'll come back to that later.

379
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Tell me about living in New York City in the 60s.

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, you know, I was mainly involved in graduate school.

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And there were some protests.

382
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I generally was not part of that.

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
My...

384
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was part of the protest.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I was part of the sense of let's do something about the problems.

386
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And mainly pollution.

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And certainly Martin Luther King Jr. had a profound effect on me.

388
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And this is a huge transformation.

389
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And it was...

390
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That was a good time.

391
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think that what happened a little bit after that,

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the drug scene and other things.

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I just... I felt like that was very different, very self-indulf.

394
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And often destructive.

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And so I really... I had a mixed feelings.

396
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I really identified, yes.

397
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's make the world a better place.

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But there also seemed to be sort of a self-centered navenous

399
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that was associated with this.

400
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And maybe a tendency to blame other people rather than saying what can we do.

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So I had a mixed... it was a mixed feeling, mixed bag.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Was this... is it fair to say this was sort of the beginnings of your environmental

403
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
consciousness that come before?

404
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, environmental consciousness came before.

405
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It came largely through the churches.

406
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And again, that's been a whole history that they don't talk about.

407
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You probably have had that.

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You probably took the history of environmental from Bob McDermott.

409
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And that's just not included.

410
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well, it was huge.

411
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, my father would have 300 boys out in this...

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
cabins out there and they had nature counselors.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And across the river of the lake was a girls camp.

414
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And there was another teenage camp.

415
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Young adults camp there.

416
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And this was a big thing.

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And so I was always taught that respect.

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And it was also a sort of a technology.

419
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, it's got some good things, but it's got some limitations too.

420
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we also had that.

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And when I got here at Oregon State University,

422
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
it was the campus ministries that were challenging higher education.

423
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There's a guy, John Connor, you oughta just do a separate history on John Connor.

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And because he probably did more to change Oregon State University than any other person here.

425
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He was a campus minister with Mr. House.

426
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And we would have classes there on environmental problems and appropriate technology.

427
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So it was a big thing.

428
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And there were some economics theories.

429
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Kenneth Bowling and Herman Daley.

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Dick Clinton is in a view him.

431
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He'll tell you about Herman Daley.

432
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And academia just sort of closed that stuff off.

433
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And but at the time in the late 60s and early 70s it was pretty exciting.

434
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I mean, there was a lot of interesting things that were happening.

435
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But that movement died out.

436
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And again it's sort of been airbrushed out of the history.

437
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I think this is one of the things that's probably important for oral history.

438
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because a lot of historians they studied the archives.

439
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, the stuff that may be most important didn't make it into the archives.

440
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because the big institutions basically don't fund that.

441
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And so it sort of disappears.

442
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So we need to have people take oral history and say, look, here's some good stuff.

443
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And it makes a lot of sense.

444
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Kenneth Bowling, Herman Daley.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I mean you go back.

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
EF Schumacher, small as beautiful.

447
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I mean, these are books that came in books of writings and speeches that were amazing.

448
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean Kenneth Bowling.

449
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He's one of the best speakers I heard on any economist.

450
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And he studied terribly.

451
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And you'd sit there and you'd first be nervous.

452
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And then you'd realize that it doesn't bother him.

453
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So it didn't bother you.

454
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It was amazing.

455
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And he came up with some really good stuff.

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I think if we weren't in no way to deal with some of the environmental problems we have now.

457
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Go back and look at them.

458
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And Kenneth Bowling, he was a Quaker.

459
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Herman Daley, I think, was a Methodist.

460
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
EF Schumacher Catholic.

461
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
This was a spiritual movement.

462
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But it was...

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It was...

464
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And nothing to do with intelligent design or evolution or anything like that.

465
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It was never an issue.

466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so that's a part of the history.

467
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
People want to understand what we're at.

468
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We're at now.

469
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think we can go back and say there were some opportunities that were missed.

470
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That happened.

471
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll come back to some of those.

472
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Sure.

473
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We'll tell me about the decision to come to OSU.

474
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
1967 you graduated from NYU.

475
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You came here.

476
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

477
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't think I sing aloud OSU for any reason.

478
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In fact, I had applied to EPA.

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And they were going to hire me.

480
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And Tom Baumgartner was over EPA.

481
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And the hire me on a uterification study of lakes.

482
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And also, estuaries.

483
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Tom was estuaries.

484
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Anyhow.

485
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
A Quatic ecosystem.

486
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And somehow a position fell through.

487
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So he sent my resume over to Fred Berges,

488
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
who was the dean of engineering.

489
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I got this notice.

490
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know, we'd like a position here.

491
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I said, yeah.

492
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I took it.

493
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What was your first impression of the university in the town?

494
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Well, I liked it.

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I really, you know, a beautiful campus.

496
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And it still is.

497
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I mean, it's, I mean, it's a few other buildings.

498
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I mean, generally, I think it's, it's a fantastic campus.

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The people were, were good or friendly.

500
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So I enjoyed.

501
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What was the department like?

502
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Department was, it was a good department.

503
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was a traditional engineering department.

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But I did have some, some certain amount of freedom.

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I started, of course, on mathematical modeling, computer simulation.

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And you look back.

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And that was a pretty big jump for a lot of the people back then,

508
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
because the digital computer was fairly new,

509
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
except in military, of course.

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And so I had a course there.

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I also had a course at graduate course.

512
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Got on the books that was something like a philosophy of technology.

513
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So they, you know, they were receptive to this.

514
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And I think my education and me and my helped a little bit,

515
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because, you know, if I felt strongly about something,

516
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I told them so.

517
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I think most people appreciated that.

518
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
At least they knew that I wasn't going to back off,

519
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because I was afraid of raising something unusual.

520
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They didn't even occur to me.

521
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So I did get some courses taught then.

522
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And at that time, I had the mightest touch.

523
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I could get research grants.

524
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I mean, I was just, you know, I couldn't believe it.

525
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Now they weren't big grants like you get now.

526
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They, but I had, on estuaries, I had one.

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And then I had, uh,

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
beautification as it leaks.

529
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What happens to leaks?

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It was a computer simulation.

531
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I got that.

532
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And I had another interesting one.

533
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And, uh, put talk a little more about that.

534
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And that was environmental strategies under indeterminacy.

535
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think that's what the title was.

536
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And, um, they even funded that.

537
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This is a small grant.

538
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Uh, but then the strange things happened.

539
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Uh, as my awareness started to expand,

540
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
the funding agency started to go narrower.

541
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And by the end of the 70s, uh, things have changed.

542
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Things have really changed.

543
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What do you think happened?

544
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, that's a good story.

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And that's the one the historians have to look at.

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Now there, there are some historians here, uh,

547
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Army Mother Nature, uh, Jacob Darwin,

548
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Hamlet, uh, great name.

549
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Jacob Darwin, I love it.

550
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And he's written a very good book.

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And it's about how the environmental movement,

552
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
or the environmental science, more environmental science.

553
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And particularly big computers came out of the military.

554
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And, uh, I didn't know that at that time.

555
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But my background was out of the sanitary engineering.

556
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So it was a whole different background.

557
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And what happened is their way of doing it took over.

558
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And the way we were doing it, shrunk.

559
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so, what they were saying is,

560
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
well, we'll build big computer models.

561
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm simplifying it.

562
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And that's how we'll approach the future.

563
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, I was in the computer model.

564
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And I said, you can't do, I mean, yeah, build computer models.

565
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But you cannot have environmental strategies,

566
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
based on prediction and control.

567
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The world is too complex.

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And so, what we did during this study,

569
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
what I did during this study,

570
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
environmental strategies under indeterminacy.

571
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I said, look, we have a strategy.

572
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's very simple.

573
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You don't need big models.

574
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You could build big models.

575
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But you need a strategy.

576
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And the strategy is, we will make mistakes.

577
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay.

578
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's called confession.

579
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay.

580
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And so, what you have to do is learn how to make good mistakes.

581
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And a good mistake is, say, reverseable.

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Uh, good mistakes are once you learn from.

583
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Good mistakes are once where you don't get painted in a box.

584
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So we came up with a strategy like this.

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And it all made very good sense.

586
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And it does to this day.

587
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean, you take carbon dioxide, the green asshole.

588
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Uh, people still to try to predict their models

589
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
or all over the place if you go far out.

590
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But the CO2 impact is almost irreversible.

591
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And it's just shooting to the sky.

592
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So under that strategy, we would have said, you got to stop.

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You can't wait to you find out what the impacts are.

594
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's too late.

595
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The world is changing faster than you can develop your predictions.

596
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I thought it all made sense.

597
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So they send when I write my file report in 78.

598
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And I got a copy of it.

599
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
One in the file.

600
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They send the guy out there to look over my shoulder while I'm writing it.

601
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And I said, this is strange.

602
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That never happened before.

603
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And I thought maybe it was because the Senator Proxima is golden fleece awards.

604
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He would ridicule scientific projects.

605
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But I realize now after some of the history books coming out,

606
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
the parents were changing.

607
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
They were saying we want big skill, computer models.

608
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And I was in the modeling book.

609
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So the guy looked over my shoulder and said, okay.

610
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And I thought he was pleased with the report.

611
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He was.

612
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But when he left, he said, we'll never fund anything like this again.

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Like, why?

614
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I was shocked.

615
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We don't have a box to put it in.

616
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
This is the answer.

617
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now I didn't realize at that time that that's what the transformation

618
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
was occurring.

619
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You're building big boxes.

620
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So you have only little specialized areas to do certain tasks to feed

621
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
them to the models.

622
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And we weren't looking at this.

623
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And one of the guys I worked with on here is Scott over to.

624
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Did you interview Scott?

625
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No.

626
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's a shame.

627
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He passed away.

628
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But there is a website.

629
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You really ought to take a look at it.

630
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Very impressive guy.

631
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And Scott and I probably had earnings stay between the two of us at the time.

632
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We published a paper in 72.

633
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We probably had more environmental computer modeling than any other two

634
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
at the university.

635
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And we basically came up with a strategy that was not based on prediction

636
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and control.

637
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And of word large scale irreversible change.

638
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You have to do that because you don't know what the consequences are

639
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
be.

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So when you make a mistake, you want to make a goodness

641
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
stake, which means it can reverse it.

642
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
CO2 doesn't reverse.

643
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean, it's up there for centuries.

644
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's sad.

645
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Tell me about overton.

646
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Overton.

647
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Scott overton statistics and forest management.

648
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And Scott, he was very disciplined.

649
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
In fact, there were people in statistics.

650
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think they were afraid of him.

651
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And good guy.

652
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Very thoughtful person.

653
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Very rigorous.

654
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Very rigorous.

655
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And he was a few years old in my,

656
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I suppose, he was a scout in World War II, I think.

657
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And how you can look up his background.

658
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And statistics and forest management.

659
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And he, he just was good.

660
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So we got together.

661
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And we started talking about this.

662
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And we said, let's write a paper on it.

663
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And it was published in the American Society Civil Engineers,

664
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a sanitary engineering division.

665
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And it really wasn't.

666
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You know, environmental science was just sort of,

667
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
that wasn't really out there.

668
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Scott had a student Larry Hutt.

669
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And I think, early 70s, he did his PhD.

670
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And he had to do it in forest management.

671
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There was no ecology.

672
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But it was in ecology, you know, PhD.

673
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We had a graduate faculty of ecology.

674
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We were sort of fighting the system.

675
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And during his, one of his last meetings,

676
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
in March as a group of faculty from forest management,

677
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
complaining that he didn't take the road design courses

678
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and the cable design, all the stuff about logging.

679
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And, well, he had a powerful committee.

680
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And there was a dean of forestry.

681
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think his name was Stoneberg.

682
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I have to get the guy credit.

683
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
He picked up the body language of our committee

684
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
that we were going to fight for this guy.

685
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And so he was very diplomatic, pretty says.

686
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, this time, but we'll arrange this.

687
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So we got him through.

688
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So Larry Hutt was probably one of the first ones

689
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
to actually get a PhD in ecology.

690
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So there were other people who had done things in biology.

691
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But it was generally, it's not, you know, like it is now.

692
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So that was interesting.

693
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about the climate

694
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
on campus in the late 60s.

695
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Obviously it was raging.

696
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
There was a lot of tumult nationwide.

697
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What was your sense of the environment on campus itself?

698
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
There was, I don't think, I think relative to other places.

699
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
There was probably less.

700
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But I think some of the inquiry sort of maybe lasted a little longer.

701
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So it's like some of the places burnt out quicker.

702
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
My contact was largely through the campus ministries.

703
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And they were really, they were really active.

704
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, the way into the 70s and in fact, even beyond that,

705
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I can remember having a course over Westminster House.

706
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And so I knew the curl of the ROTC curl.

707
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Kurt Rossler, I think, is this name.

708
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And he, I was probably late 70s, I'm guessing.

709
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And I may have the date off, but you can look about his pictures up there.

710
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And he was a tank commander.

711
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so this is the cold war.

712
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And during cold war, Saudi tanks were, you know, I mean, the armed divisions.

713
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They were powerful.

714
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
This was a major concern.

715
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So I brought him over to one of these classes.

716
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And there are a whole lot of what we call hippies.

717
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And in this class, any just wars, whether casual civilian clothes,

718
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
any started talking with them.

719
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And they didn't want to like him.

720
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But they did.

721
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He was a good guy.

722
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And I remember asking him the question.

723
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What is a more danger to American society?

724
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The Soviet tank or the American gas goes in car.

725
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And he said, oh, that's easy.

726
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's the car.

727
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And so, I mean, we had those kinds of discussions that were going on.

728
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They sort of ended late 80s.

729
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Late 80s, we put on a conference on Eisenhower's federal well address.

730
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
He warns about the military industrial complex.

731
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But people don't realize he also warned about the university.

732
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And the danger is that the pursuit of government grants and contracts will be pursued

733
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
so much that intellectual curiosity will be given up.

734
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We must guard against the scientific technological leader after that.

735
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
He says only informed and knowledgeable citizenry can prevent this from happening.

736
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, he has some powerful stuff.

737
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So we did a whole conference on that.

738
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And one of the things we didn't that conference, Craig Walker, you can interview him.

739
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
He's the mayor.

740
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He gave a copy of the book.

741
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We did on it.

742
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
He and I wrote a chapter at the end.

743
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And we said, suppose George Bush gave this conference.

744
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because George Bush, the first George Bush was present at that.

745
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And not George W. That was his George W's father.

746
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And so what we did is we took portions of the speech.

747
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And we just said, suppose George Bush wrote this.

748
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And the only thing we'll change is his warning is not about the military industrial complex.

749
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Is the oil industrial complex.

750
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And so we changed.

751
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And it's really a radical.

752
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It comes across really radical.

753
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, you can take that and take it for his son.

754
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You can take it and give that speech now.

755
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And he was warning.

756
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I mean, it's remarkable with Eisenhower.

757
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
His whole life was in the military industrial complex.

758
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And his final warning is warning about it.

759
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I was very impressed with that.

760
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah.

761
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And your sense was always seen as foreign parade of these warnings.

762
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh, yeah.

763
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I think pursuit of the research.

764
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's not just OSU.

765
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But I think higher education in general.

766
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I mean pursuit of research.

767
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm a word graded when I was there.

768
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Research.

769
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean, I don't know whether anybody read the papers.

770
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But you sure had to put a list on how much money you brought in.

771
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I think that's pretty pretty common right now.

772
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And so you bring in more money.

773
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And I said, this is strange.

774
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You know, we're being paid.

775
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We rewarded for spending more money.

776
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Why don't we say, look, gee, I did all this interesting stuff.

777
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And I didn't spend very much of the tax payers money.

778
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean, it seemed to me that would make sense.

779
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But it didn't work that way.

780
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So was the paper with Overton and 72 is that sort of the beginning of the system's theory work?

781
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Well, the system's theory work first of all in the computer modeling and ecosystems.

782
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I was doing ecosystems.

783
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So I was involved in systems.

784
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And I was involved in some ecologist or limb knowledge,

785
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
or just G. Evelyn Hodgson.

786
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And there were a number of people owed them ecology to the beginning of ecology.

787
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So I had used some of their work, met some of those people.

788
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And I was coming at it.

789
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But I began to realize that the rivers aren't the problem.

790
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The trees aren't the problem. The fish aren't the problem.

791
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's the human systems that are the problem.

792
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So I began to realize this in the 70s, maybe even a little before that.

793
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And so what I started doing was studying human systems.

794
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Now, if you're going to study human systems, kind of, you make a choice.

795
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I mean, I computers.

796
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So I can sit behind a computer, of course they didn't have the computer screens,

797
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
but now of course they do.

798
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Or I can actually get out in the organizational systems.

799
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And see what's happening.

800
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I chose that second route.

801
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And that was actually a conscious choice.

802
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm going to collect experiences.

803
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm not going to be sitting eventually,

804
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but they got computer screens.

805
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm not going to be sitting behind a computer screen.

806
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So I never had email on campus.

807
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Never.

808
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay.

809
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Never.

810
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I have some at home now.

811
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Will gamble.

812
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You can interview him.

813
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I don't know.

814
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
He didn't either.

815
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So we were probably the last ones.

816
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But I'm working with these computer systems.

817
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Now, when you work with these computer systems,

818
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
there's a whole level of mathematics that you can do.

819
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Not many of your dynamics, emergence.

820
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That you can't do with traditional mathematics.

821
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And, you know, I could explain it.

822
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Take me about three-four minutes.

823
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Explain it because I'd have to explain differential equations.

824
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But basically, you couldn't solve the equations.

825
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And what you would do in differential equations.

826
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You start out with the initial condition.

827
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You tell the rates of change.

828
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And then you can make a prediction.

829
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Okay?

830
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But with certain equations, non-linear.

831
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That's particularly, if they're, say, three-dimensional.

832
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So you're going to see in space, you know, what the predictions are.

833
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You end up with the things going around like this.

834
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's called chaos.

835
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And you end up with essentially the world is just not that predictable.

836
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then you're throwing complexity.

837
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And so over tonight, we're on to that, 72.

838
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
If you look up the references, one of them, I think the title,

839
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
had one plus one, does not equal to.

840
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That is the whole cannot be reduced to some of the parts.

841
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And the other one was a paper by Warren Weaver that basically said,

842
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Science doesn't, does not know how to deal with problems of organized complexity.

843
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So I was into the math.

844
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay?

845
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Because with the digital computer, you can approximate the solution

846
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
to equations that you cannot solve.

847
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So you don't solve them.

848
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You get a finite difference in numerical methods and approximations.

849
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That's what all the computer simulations are doing now.

850
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
They don't solve the equations like they do in differential equations.

851
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
They can't.

852
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
They can't even come close.

853
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
But the non-linear behave in weird ways.

854
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, the non-linear world is bizarre.

855
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And it's only bizarre because for several hundred years,

856
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
we've been taught to think linearly.

857
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And when you're taught to think linearly,

858
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
then when something non-linear comes up, it seems bizarre.

859
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So I would meet with a guy, John Goman.

860
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
If you ever get a chance, he'd be a good one to interview.

861
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
He was the campus minister here.

862
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And the best description of John is he's a medieval monk transported by a time machine.

863
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So he'd never pass through the analytical age of, say, Newton and Galileo,

864
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the analysis, breaking it down into parts.

865
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He fought holistically, you know?

866
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And he didn't have any trouble with this.

867
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We had these discussions for years.

868
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The students would just come and people would come and meet at these discussions.

869
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And so the non-linear world is a strange world.

870
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's a world that requires you to think more with the right hemisphere of your brain.

871
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
In my Gilchrist has a great video, people should look at it,

872
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
but divided brain.

873
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And he says the left hemisphere is sequential linear.

874
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And we have become dominated by left brain thinking.

875
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay, I think that's true.

876
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And he describes what kind of organization would you get

877
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
if it was dominated by left hemisphere.

878
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And he describes, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the universe.

879
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So the right hemisphere is just the world is so amazing.

880
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It's just things emerge, and so anyhow, that's the stuff I got into.

881
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But I wanted to get into it from the human perspective.

882
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Big organizations.

883
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I didn't want to stay in the mathematical modeling.

884
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I kept teaching, I had to make a living.

885
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I kept teaching the computer modeling, and I enjoyed it.

886
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I enjoyed teaching.

887
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But when I teach the even engineering mechanics,

888
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I almost never brought in notes.

889
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The class knows never.

890
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
The interact with the students.

891
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And the best classes occurred when the course,

892
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
the class, went in the direction that I didn't even anticipate.

893
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And it just got to keep my life.

894
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And then the eyes light up when they get something as great.

895
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It strikes me that you're placing an imperative on getting away

896
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
from the computer screen.

897
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's getting out and interacting with people.

898
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It falls the same while your father took it.

899
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

900
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah, he really did.

901
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He majored physics, heal, which had that time.

902
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Physics.

903
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't know how he did.

904
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's tough.

905
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I mean, because physics, that time was going to a huge change.

906
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And I brought him when he retired a pendulum in it.

907
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
He has several magnets, so it's a non-linear.

908
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And it doesn't just swing back and forth.

909
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It just goes in this.

910
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And when he looked at that his eyes lit up and he just laughed and he says,

911
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that would improve in my professor's crazy.

912
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, so I did that.

913
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It also sounds like there's a divergence between the curriculum that you're teaching,

914
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
or being compelled to teach in your research interest.

915
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Oh, I have an opposite direction.

916
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
If I take my career at Oregon State, I can put all my accomplishments

917
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
in two piles.

918
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
A, that got me promotion and tenure.

919
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It was full professor, tenure, all the rest of this.

920
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
A, right away.

921
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Pile B over here didn't go anywhere within your sensation.

922
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Or, you know, not very, not very far.

923
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
The most important pile is B.

924
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You can throw out all the rest.

925
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Now, I learned a lot by, say, teaching engineering mechanics.

926
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And you learn a lot.

927
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:34,000
There, for example, in the tennis courses, the way we teach the math isn't that important.

928
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You have to teach students how to sketch.

929
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Make a sketch.

930
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's called a free body diagram.

931
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Ask any student who's taking it.

932
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You have to have to draw it.

933
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So how do you make a sketch?

934
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How do you think?

935
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
How do you do that?

936
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You know?

937
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And you engage the students in that, you know, making the simple sketches.

938
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So when I went to study human systems, I'm going to make sketches.

939
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Because the sketch is too dimensional.

940
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Okay?

941
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You know, it goes too dimensional sketch.

942
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Now, you can make a free dimensional.

943
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
That's not too hard to go to free dimension.

944
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But going from one dimension, which is a written text, to two dimensions, is a huge difference.

945
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, you can talk about something as perpendicular in two dimensions.

946
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And that means this dimension cannot be reduced to this dimension.

947
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They're orthogonal.

948
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Well, in one dimensional lines of reasoning, you can't do that.

949
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I mean, you can sort of say it, but you don't see it.

950
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So the average board, typical book is what about a half mile long.

951
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's only one line.

952
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's only arranged on pages for convenience.

953
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And so that shapes the way we think.

954
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We think in lines.

955
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And the world does not behave in lines.

956
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The world is much more of this way.

957
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Now, if you go on a construction site, I learned this my first job.

958
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
They give you a set of specs, all lines, right?

959
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And a set of drawings.

960
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I was never looked at the specs.

961
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I was all over those drawings.

962
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And if you go out on the construction site, watch construction on campus.

963
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And you'll see people using body language.

964
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You'll see them taking out diagrams.

965
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
They're not sitting around studying text professors to that.

966
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But they could never build a building like that.

967
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Well, I'm wondering if the system's theory.

968
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean, my impression anyway, it could be wrong about this.

969
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But it was sort of kind of the spine of your work.

970
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And then that went off in a lot of different kind of more topical directions.

971
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Or kind of current events eat types, directions that true.

972
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Well, my work, I finally, a lot of the work in systems now is going highly sophisticated mathematics.

973
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And the study of emergence, for example,

974
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
one of the best people of biology is Stuart Kaufman.

975
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And he's done randomized Boolean networks.

976
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
He did some things, it's a mathematical.

977
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And it's pretty good.

978
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So, I've done some of that.

979
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But I go, what's the point in all the math?

980
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I mean, if we're trying to understand the world that people are living in,

981
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
then we ought to be able to communicate to them.

982
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Because they know more about that world than we do.

983
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So, what I do is I make sketches.

984
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Okay?

985
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And you make sketches.

986
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And now I'll do like ten statements on a sketch.

987
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Ten simple statements connected by arrows.

988
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So they look.

989
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Okay?

990
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And I'll get people, if I can get them to read it.

991
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The people who read it, no, no.

992
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You just described my life.

993
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This is what's going on.

994
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
So one of them that I did was how information gets distorted in organizations.

995
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The classic example explanation we give is blame.

996
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Look at the veterans administration.

997
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Okay, information was distorted.

998
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So what do they do?

999
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They fire erection psyche.

1000
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I mean, he's got to be one of the most honest straightforward guys you can imagine.

1001
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I mean, he's an honorable person.

1002
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I mean that in the best sense of the word.

1003
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And you listen to the congress, and there everybody's blaming everybody.

1004
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So what I did is I made a simple sketch.

1005
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And how organization is a system.

1006
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And it provides a context within which everybody finds reasons to behave in their own particular way.

1007
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But the system is a whole the store's information.

1008
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Okay?

1009
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That's what I do.

1010
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And that everybody inside of it has a good reason.

1011
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And there ordinary people like us.

1012
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So I've done that.

1013
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1014
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I graduated visual one in late seventies.

1015
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And I first didn't publish it, but the model sort circulated,

1016
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and people would send me.

1017
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I got a zero X of the zero X can use send me a copy.

1018
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So then in 86 I think it was the shuttle block.

1019
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I'm watching television and I see Bridget Fineman.

1020
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And he's trying to explain what's going on.

1021
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,680
going on. He's describing my model. I never studied NASA. So I sent them a copy of the diagram

1022
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,560
in this table and I didn't know he was dying as stomach cancer. I think it was not cancer

1023
00:58:53,560 --> 00:59:00,200
at the time. I wish I were to thank them, you know, so if you want to thank someone,

1024
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:09,560
thank them quick when they die, I'll do it now. Thanks, Richard. Okay, and he read it and he

1025
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,520
wrote me back this letter and he says, I read this table in a amazed perfect prediction.

1026
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,280
No, I don't use perfect prediction, but if you're rich and fine, and you can use, you know,

1027
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,440
you can use perfect prediction. And he says, I didn't realize that NASA was part of a general

1028
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,920
phenomenon. Technically, if I said that, we'd say that's a grammatical error, a phenomena.

1029
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:41,000
If Richard Feynman says it, it's brilliant. Okay, so then I started publishing it. Now next month,

1030
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,880
I'll just I'll be going to Quebec City for the American Fisheries Society to present this model.

1031
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,960
Okay, and I got a figure out how to do it on a PowerPoint now because it's going to be 2500 people

1032
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,040
and I've got half an hour. So that's a little, I like to interact, but you know, you interact with

1033
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:08,920
2500 people. So anyhow, I draw these models and when people can understand them and they see it,

1034
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,520
then they can start telling you, because they know more about the experience in the world and I do,

1035
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,640
they can start telling you. And to a large extent, what I'm doing is I'm providing an alternative

1036
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:28,520
to blame and looking at these larger systems. Now it's consistent with a lot of the mathematics

1037
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:37,640
that's going on. It's just that you can experience it in life. And if the world is not linear and

1038
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,640
emergent, we are experiencing it. So we have to open up our eyes.

1039
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:51,080
When one looks at sort of an abstracted, you've either, there are issues that are mostly in the past

1040
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,120
now and wondering if what you've just described is, if these are examples of it happening,

1041
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,960
that model have been applied in the past to things like space-based weaponry.

1042
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:09,720
Yeah, I will see, I, that was an interesting, I, about the 1980s, some of the 1980s.

1043
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,320
I was really getting frustrated with the environmental because, you know, that's about the time

1044
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,680
that they started the global warming. We will make predictive models and scientists may say,

1045
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,320
well, we really weren't, no, no, that's the way the objectives were written. I went back and

1046
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:31,160
look at the original documents and we'll develop predictive models and I said, now you want to

1047
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:39,000
this, you know, so I got frustrated. So I wanted to learn more about large-scale computer systems

1048
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,480
and that cannot understand organizations by just observing. So I went and I spent six years

1049
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:55,320
Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program and I had no funding. So I could go to the meetings and I didn't

1050
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:01,560
have to hustle any money and oh, you go to these meetings and, you know, these consultants,

1051
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:09,640
they're always half-thousand money. And so I could ask these questions and I said, I want to see

1052
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:17,560
if I can, as a citizen, if I can find something, make a contribution here to something that

1053
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,800
you know, they don't see. And I did find, I did, I could. And that's a whole other story in the

1054
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:30,600
involves an interesting character, including Richard Cheney, who was Secretary Defense at the time.

1055
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:37,560
So, and Richard Garwin, who designed the hydrogen bomb, interesting, really interesting guy.

1056
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:45,400
So, I met some interesting people and I did some interesting things, but I was mainly interested

1057
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:53,240
in these human systems and how, and then the large-scale technological ones and how we can lose control.

1058
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,240
I mean, the control was sort of often in the lose.

1059
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:03,400
You referenced earlier John Connor in West Mr. House in the local environment a little bit.

1060
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,880
You want to talk more about him in that period of time?

1061
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:12,840
Yeah, John Connor was a campus minister. He had been a minister in the Mexico.

1062
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:19,240
It turns out he, I found that years later that he, he knew my cousin in return, I think, was

1063
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:29,000
her a time in Mexico. And, and he had John was, he was very tall and I had this long beard.

1064
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:37,960
He just would raise all sorts of questions. He raised all sorts of questions. He'd just be bouncing around

1065
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:45,640
and he sort of stir up the pot. And we, at that particular time,

1066
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:57,560
there was a whole national movement where theology, or mainline churches were challenging higher

1067
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,640
education. There's a book on it, Douglas Sloan, Columbia University, it's called Faith in Knowledge.

1068
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,560
And probably out of print now, but it's very good book. And they, they were challenging

1069
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:18,680
higher education. And what Sloan writes about is that went on for about two decades.

1070
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:23,880
And Eisenhower's learning is sort of right in the middle of that. So there was a time in there where

1071
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:31,080
where people are are looking at the problems of technology. Yes, it has good things,

1072
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:36,840
but we have to recognize this limitations too. And there was sort of this attitude there.

1073
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:46,040
And so John played a key role in that. And he was mainly the facilitator of it. He became

1074
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:56,200
moderator of the Presbyterian Church, which is, I guess, the highest position. And he, he, he would,

1075
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:04,520
you know, he did a lot of interesting things. But for me, it was like he was sort of at the

1076
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:11,160
focal point of the center of the world when we were all interesting things were happening.

1077
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:20,600
So that was very important time. And there were concepts that came up in very, very important.

1078
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:33,560
I wrote a paper published in 2006 on evil. Evil in a time.

1079
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:40,200
Well, this was a, it's a secular germ. I mean, it's, it's on emergency evils, the dilapidate.

1080
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:49,480
And I use concepts from theology in there. And no one raised any concern.

1081
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:56,200
It was, you know, they were helping us to understand this, this phenomenon. And basically,

1082
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:04,040
I was saying that evil, large patterns emerge. And ordinary people like you and I get caught up

1083
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:11,240
within them. And in biblical language that would be bondage of blindness, you're caught up within it.

1084
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:18,200
And you can't transcend it transcend the context, the system that you're caught up within.

1085
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:25,320
And horrible things could be done. And the example I use was a Soviet biological warfare system.

1086
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:34,440
And it is horrible things. And by some top scientists, so scientists can get caught up in it just like anybody else.

1087
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,720
Anyhow, that, you know, that probably has goes back in some ways to John Connor.

1088
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,840
It's interesting how often you've been working with church groups.

1089
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm on the French. It's French and church groups. I, you know, I, I don't go regularly to

1090
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:01,080
services, but they're, see, part of it, I'm studying models. Well,

1091
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,600
I learned models as a kid. They were called parables.

1092
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:17,400
A parable is a model. All models are simplifications. And what they do is help to clarify some

1093
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:25,800
matters of importance, not all. And they expose their limitations. Okay? So a parable is a story.

1094
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:31,000
What you do is you get engaged in the power you learn to get, you know, you don't think much of

1095
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,480
an engagement. And then as you're going through life, you begin to see something.

1096
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:48,520
And that's what the purpose of, of a good model really is that you play with it to engage in it.

1097
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:54,360
And then it allows you to become aware of something. And it's very different than having a big computer

1098
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:00,840
that no one knows what it's doing and it spits out data. So in that sense, what I was involved

1099
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:08,840
was, had its roots there in parables. But also, in engineering, you know,

1100
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,320
scientists act like all the stuff that we build here and all the stuff comes out of science.

1101
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:26,200
Okay? And, uh, whereas I would say yes, but I thought engineering mechanics, Newtonian

1102
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:33,480
mechanics, when engineers build, like the buildings on campus, just go watch their amazing

1103
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:42,600
and build them on campus. Okay? We also use safety factors. And we don't talk about students don't

1104
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:48,920
know about this. And we're to safety factors come from, they come from confession and repentance.

1105
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:56,440
You know, confession repents is an analophole. It's not self-blame. It means you've done something

1106
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:04,680
and there's a failure. What are you going to do? You admit to the failure and you change your ways.

1107
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,840
And that's how you learn. That's how you learn how to write a bike. You know, study bicycle writing,

1108
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,960
the theory of bicycle writing, and pass a quiz, a multiple grade, you know, a multiple choice

1109
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:23,320
quiz and say, now I'm a bike writer. You get on it and you fall down. That's how life is. And so

1110
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,480
in engineering, similar engineering in particular, if you look at the history, you see all these

1111
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:33,080
pictures of bridges that fell down, you'd begin to say, what's going on here? That's how we learn.

1112
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:41,720
And there's a historian, uh, uh, engineering. And he has some statements. He read one the other day

1113
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,760
behind every, almost every success is a history of failure, something like this.

1114
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:54,440
Well, that's probably pretty good theology, too. So there's been a whole part. It's not about

1115
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:01,960
belief systems. And they even churches get that wrong. You know, the word belief is a modern word.

1116
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:08,520
You know, the word religion, even. I mean, you know, it's a new word. I mean, no one that's

1117
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:16,280
less than 100 years. As a system of belief, it just doesn't make sense. So, uh, what you learn

1118
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:22,760
with stories and and parables, and you went out into the world, and you made mistakes. Guess what?

1119
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:30,040
So that's how you learn. So when I, when I come back to some stuff that I learned in church and

1120
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:38,040
stuff that I learned in engineering and stuff that I learned in environment, there are some

1121
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:46,440
common things. Now, what's absent is some of this foolishness like intelligent design or things like

1122
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:55,080
this. And this, this is just a big distraction. I mean, you know, I mean, John Connor had no problem

1123
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:01,480
with evolution. I father didn't. Now, maybe his father maybe did, but a lot of people did things change.

1124
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:12,280
So I, I've sort of been on the fringe of some, some, I guess you call theological insights

1125
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:19,640
that are pretty cool. There's some interesting ones. And they're not about belief systems. And one of

1126
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:28,520
one of the things you find now, for example, is how Buddhism and Christianity have parts of it,

1127
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:33,400
is just sort of come together and read discovery each other. And you take a guy like Richard

1128
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:41,560
Rourer, who's a friend, Syskin Catholic, and he will talk about the Dalai Alama, the Dalai Alama,

1129
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:50,920
the Dalai Alama. I mean, this is like, you know, the boxes we put people in, it just doesn't

1130
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:58,760
make sense. So, thank you. Tell me about the swallowed camel club. Oh, the swallowed camel club.

1131
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:08,920
Okay. Okay, the swallowed camel club. We had a group that is spontaneously met many years ago.

1132
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,960
I don't know how many. First of the library, we would make it almost too much in the ways.

1133
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:25,640
And so we, so we started meeting over at the St. Anne's Office, Episcopal Campus District,

1134
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:32,120
because John Connor, our time, John Goldman, was John Goldman. And he's the guy that's this medieval

1135
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:41,480
monk. And we were, people were, we raised certain questions and say, I say, well, are you getting

1136
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:49,160
this in your classes? I got no. So if you really want to find out what's being taught, you have to ask the students,

1137
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:56,440
ask the students. So the stuff on complexity and all of the rest of these big-scale systems,

1138
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:03,720
those, you know, they're not addressing all things. Not really. Not in a way that registers

1139
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:12,760
with the students. I mean the student. Okay. So we have had these discussions. So what are we going to

1140
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:22,840
call our group? Well, there's an ancient criticism of university professors. You blind guides.

1141
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:30,680
You strain out a mat and swallow a camel. Okay. It's gospel same Matthew. Okay. And it's right

1142
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:38,840
hemisphere. It's got a metaphor, blind guide. You strain out a mat, swallow a camel. Three mat

1143
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:45,480
forces. That's the right hand. And he puts them together in irony and humor. And yet, people go, yeah.

1144
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:52,600
So obviously a camel is not the sum of a lot of little nets. So it's not linear. So anyhow,

1145
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,680
we would laugh and sort of be the joke we called this whole camel club. And we're not meeting

1146
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:07,400
this summer. And it's going on pretty strong. The last several months though, we've sort of dropped

1147
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,920
off and part of it. I've been working on some other stuff. And part John Goldman has retired,

1148
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,600
physical churches going through some changes. So I'm not sure where it's going to go. But it has

1149
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:25,160
gone on for years. And there's still, I got a email list of 30, 40 people who would

1150
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:33,160
plong to it. I sent it out. Did you have any contact with Katherine Jefford's story? Yeah,

1151
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:39,240
a little bit of contact with Katherine Jefford's story. And Dick's story, he was a mathematics

1152
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:49,800
or husband and non-linear of dynamics. But not much on this. Not much on this. She's done a,

1153
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:55,320
you know, an outstanding job. And certainly on making the, I'm not a physical family, but

1154
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:03,000
making the physical church work, certainly for open days and less means. And she's, she's really

1155
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
done that and had to fight some battles. And she does it very, very graciously, very graciously.

1156
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,640
I would say I'd love to get, she also has a PhD in oceanography. I would also be fun to have

1157
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:29,080
in conversation with the fair and then to say Marcus Borg and all the other Marcus Borg.

1158
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:37,000
Because I would be a little more questioning of science than I think they are. It's not that

1159
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:45,320
science back. It's just that, that there's a lot of specialization and a lot of claims.

1160
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:54,920
It does wonderful things. But not everything. And we could, we could have an interesting discussion.

1161
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,600
I want to ask you about a couple kind of bullet points from your beat of past research interests

1162
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:06,200
that I think have particular bookability to people in this state. The first one is an issue that's

1163
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,760
been important to folks. My set of state needs to know again that's destruction of chemical weapons.

1164
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:19,000
Oh yeah, that's an interesting story. So I got invited on this one. I actually got paid for this one.

1165
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,240
You know, I'm not a whole lot. But a lot of the work I did I didn't get paid for, I just did it.

1166
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:29,240
And I make my living teaching. The United States had millions of

1167
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:38,760
literally millions and millions of chemical munitions stored all over. And I mean, they say their weapons

1168
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:46,760
most of them are not usable. And one of them, for example, the M55 rocket, they mean half a million

1169
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:54,280
of them. It's about a seven foot rocket, about six, seven feet. And it's not guided. And they don't

1170
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:01,960
even have launchers. And the thing I think tends to go like this. So they got all these rockets.

1171
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:09,080
Well, what are you going to do with them? And they got, they have the warheads with the chemical

1172
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:15,880
agent inside of it. So you got like a liquid and you got a birch there because it's an aerosols.

1173
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:22,040
I'm not really a gas. And then you got this old booster rocket. And they've riveted the

1174
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:29,800
warheads on. So they can't just unscrew them. So they have to get rid of them. So I was part of a

1175
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:40,520
independent team to review the risk analysis. Because they want to know whether they should

1176
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:47,720
ship them off site or destroy them on site and incineration and all the rest of us. Well,

1177
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:55,000
one of the things I looked at was the M55 rocket. And they had these big steel insulated containers

1178
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:04,360
to transport them. And they had on wood pallets. So I don't know if they might have that 15 on a pallet

1179
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:11,720
and two pallets might 30. So they'd have 15 or 30 inside when they'd be. And they had tests.

1180
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,960
So they could drop it from 20 feet. And if there's a fire could insulate, they went through

1181
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:24,520
all these accident scenarios. Well, the way they do risk analysis is they break it down into

1182
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:29,720
a different rule. What's the probability of this? The science of this job. What's the probability

1183
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:34,680
of this? And they put them all together to find the probability of an accident occurring,

1184
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,680
which requires maybe three or four or five different things happening. So it's a low probability.

1185
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:46,120
And a lot of the stuff to have to pull out in the air. Like what's the probability of an

1186
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:52,200
airplane crashing into one of these igles or these storage bins? Well, they have to figure out how many

1187
01:18:52,200 --> 01:19:03,880
planes crashing into the air. So the one I came up with is, okay, what happens to the rockets

1188
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:11,880
if there is a train wreck? Well, don't worry. So the warhead, you know, we've checked the warhead

1189
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:20,600
on this thing and we won't go off. I said, I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about

1190
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:30,440
the rocket igniting inside and it turns out that when they set up the system, they didn't put

1191
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:38,440
a box for that. So because all that won't happen. That won't happen. That won't happen.

1192
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:43,800
So you go over the meeting and when they say, oh, that won't happen. Wait for the coffee break.

1193
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,600
Wait for the coffee break. Because then somebody comes up, why don't you go check? I've heard

1194
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:56,200
this. They say this. So anyhow, I end up in Tuala, Utah and they're going to go in on a tour

1195
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:03,720
of the incineration, but you have to work cast mass and they want me to shade my beard and

1196
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,120
say, oh, I don't want to shave my beard. So will we be out here? Will this leave you with this guy?

1197
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:15,720
That's good. They leave you with somebody. This guy tests these warheads.

1198
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:24,920
It's very ingenious design of the warhead, you know, the fused, the fused. But in the process,

1199
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:34,760
I learned that, but I was concerned is inside the, if you have a crash, all these rockets start

1200
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:45,000
smashing around, then you take steel and you bend it. It gives off heat. So is it possible that

1201
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:50,360
in the twisting of the metal, you'll get enough heat to ignite the rocket? Because all the

1202
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:57,800
rocket really is, is solid booster inside a steel tube. And it's a slow explosion. The gas goes

1203
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:05,960
out the bottom. So I had done some calculations, rough calculations, you know, how much heat would

1204
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:12,600
begin off, you puncture the steel casing, and then how much temperature would rise in the steel

1205
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:19,160
right around it, and compared that to the ignition temperature of the rocket and it was higher.

1206
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:26,920
So, if you were to say, oh, there's no data on that. Well, when they say there's no data,

1207
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:33,480
sorry, that may be, you know, we've never seen the data, or we've never collected the data,

1208
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:40,360
or it doesn't mean that they shouldn't be. Anyhow, I find out that to this guy, and I get the

1209
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:49,800
field notes, that they test these rockets by dropping 20 of them, and three of them ignited.

1210
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:58,120
Three ignited. And I heard some stories about them trying to test the warhead, you know,

1211
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,560
so they get a guy to shoot a rifle at the warhead, and sometimes he misses in his the rocket

1212
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:11,560
and so the rocket takes stock, but they didn't have a box to put this in. So they get the number

1213
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:20,600
three out of 20. So you get a probability, three out of 20, it's like three by 20, and I said,

1214
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:27,240
I've seen that number before, because I go through all these calculations sheets, and I come and

1215
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:33,080
I find that number, and they say, oh, that's the probability of a warhead going out of my

1216
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:39,800
rocket release. It gives a reference. I look up this reference. And what happened is, everybody started

1217
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:46,120
referencing everybody else, and what started out as a rocket ignition ended up as the warhead

1218
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:56,120
got off. Okay. And of course, if it's the rocket igniting, and there's 15 or 30 other rockets

1219
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:03,320
inside, it's still contained. You got a bomb, okay, because they can only hold like three rockets

1220
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:12,200
igniting. So we pointed out that to them, and so that was kind of interesting, because it

1221
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:19,640
illustrates that the science that gets done depends to a large extent on how the organization

1222
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:27,000
of it is structured and funded. And if everybody says, gee, that's an interesting idea, but it's

1223
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:34,760
not my job. That means it's not being done. Everybody has a good reason why they're not doing it.

1224
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:47,400
But what happens is the organizational structure in a sense can direct us, ask certain questions,

1225
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:54,520
and not do other questions. And then when those questions come up, occasionally, people can just

1226
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,880
dismiss us on my job. So we'd better change the organization. That's not my job. It's the

1227
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:06,200
organization to big. I can't change it. And so what happens is the problems continue. Now fortunately,

1228
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:12,600
they've managed to get rid of all the M55 rockets. They did not transport them. So we got the right

1229
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:23,160
decision. You know, we brought that. And how much of my response state, we eroded up and how much

1230
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:28,760
of it survived through the bureaucratic process. Some of it did, some of it didn't. So I don't know.

1231
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:37,480
But it was fascinating that I learned a lot about risk analysis and organizational structure.

1232
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:46,440
So they're doing a good job. And I mean, they had to get incinerated because these rockets

1233
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,880
they put a stabilizer in them. But if that stabilizer degrades and they think it does,

1234
01:24:53,880 --> 01:25:02,040
I mean, the rockets go off. And they're all stored together. That's not good. They had literally

1235
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:08,200
millions of millions of emissions. So when you read in the paper of the Soviet Union and the United

1236
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:17,000
States arguing about who's, you know, have the weapons and so forth. What they should have

1237
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,400
been saying was, here you take it. No, you take it. No, I don't want them. You take it. I mean,

1238
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:31,320
they were billion dollar problem. Okay, potential disaster. And, you know, that was interesting.

1239
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:36,200
Yeah. So what other bullet? I want to ask about salmon in the idea of salmon parks.

1240
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:43,160
Oh, yeah, salmon. Well, I've worked a lot with fisheries biologists and largely because once I started

1241
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:49,560
studying these human systems, I didn't get any research grants. So I done my travel money. So

1242
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:56,120
salmon's a local one and we had some very fine people here in salmon. So the American fisheries

1243
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:04,920
society back in 2005, they published it in 2006, but somewhere before then they basically said,

1244
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:13,960
we've been trying, we've been trying to protect wild salmon and we spent billions of dollars

1245
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:25,080
and it's not working. So we want to select 33 people from out the country and even maybe

1246
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:34,040
outside the country, but mainly Canada and the United States and Northwest. What would you do?

1247
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:42,280
They're totally free to say, what would you do? Okay. And so I was 100. Okay.

1248
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:49,240
So Bob Lacky, he's over there in political science and fisheries. He was the

1249
01:26:50,440 --> 01:27:01,240
director and Denise Locke, who was on it. So, so Bob, so they framed the problem.

1250
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:09,240
The problem is, how do we have significant numbers of wild salmon by the year 2100? And then

1251
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:22,440
he had four policy guides and one of them, or four policy drivers, okay, something that

1252
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:31,160
means. And one of them was, people are going to have to change their preferences,

1253
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:39,240
their values, their preferences. So I went through the whole thing and I basically

1254
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:45,800
concluded that the way they framed the problem, you can't sell the problem. Okay, we're not going to sell

1255
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:52,200
it. And besides the problem numbers of wild salmon, that's not the real problem. The problem

1256
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:58,280
is, what kind of world do we want to leave future generations? And the whole business about

1257
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:06,280
preferences, I said, no, we're going to get outcomes that no one prefers. So, so what I did is,

1258
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:11,960
I reframe the problem. Now that's kind of like you're being given a test in the go on in the

1259
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,280
side, I can't answer this question, so I'm going to change the question, and I'm supposed to do that.

1260
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:23,320
So, but I did it, and I got to give them credit, they kept the paper in there. So,

1261
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:30,680
basically what I had to do is, I thought it would be real easy, I'll just say,

1262
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:39,080
of wild salmon national park. That's what we need. But I, in order to do that, I had to challenge

1263
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:45,800
all the ways that we're thinking, which are linear ways of thinking. A wild salmon national park

1264
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:53,160
is doable. We have all sorts of agencies doing all sorts of things, like the Corps of Engineers

1265
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:59,080
since mitigation sites. We don't even know where they are. Okay, if you pull that money together

1266
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:09,000
and you could buy up, particularly high-flug-prone areas, which are the best habitats,

1267
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,280
all the way throughout the whole north west, and you would have a distributed wild salmon

1268
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:21,000
national park. Okay, even through cities, people want their waterfronts. So, you know, it wouldn't be

1269
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:28,760
total of natural systems, but, and there are a whole sorts of flood zones, and you look at the

1270
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:36,440
lamb and river, and you see all these different twists and turns, and the farmers have trouble

1271
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:41,560
farming there because they flood, they plant all these weeds, but they call weeds, which

1272
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:49,720
and biologists call the natural floor. Okay, it's really funny. And if you look at the people who are

1273
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:55,800
studying floods and they map out high-flug-prone areas, and we got to prevent development to

1274
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,760
do something about that, and then you go over to the wildlife biologists and take their maps of

1275
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:07,400
ideal habitat, and they almost overlap. So it's a no-brainer. Okay, why don't we just buy some of

1276
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:15,640
this land and pay the people, you know, not to build there rather than putting concrete or rock

1277
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:21,800
rip wrap along the banks because it may erode. So I went through a whole bunch of those things, and I

1278
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:29,640
basically found that we could have a wild salmon national park, and it would run right through

1279
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:38,040
different parts of the whole Pacific Northwest, and try and let the salmon come back, let the salmon

1280
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:46,600
guys. The biggest resistance seemed to come from the science, and it wasn't about the science,

1281
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:51,880
everybody agreed we have to protect habitat, but they would say nobody's going to support the

1282
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:02,600
people don't prefer that. Well, I took that and said, how do you know? Okay, first it's not about

1283
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:12,840
preferences. The amount of money is patents. I took the comparatively the whole national park budget for

1284
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:19,960
that year. It's minor. I may get the numbers wrong, but five billion, let's just say. Okay.

1285
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:29,640
And then I compared the bonuses given to Goldman Sachs, one bank is like 20 billion. Okay,

1286
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:34,040
is much big. Here's the national park, the whole national market. Here's the, here's the

1287
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:42,680
bonuses given to Goldman Sachs, the year before the whole system crashed. Okay, I don't think the

1288
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:50,040
people even in Goldman Sachs think that that's make sense, but you say, oh people want. And then

1289
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:59,880
the same year that we polt finally published this, PBS did a special, a national parks, America's

1290
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:08,360
best idea. So basically I conclude that the reason we don't have that is because the institutions

1291
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:15,640
of frame the problem in pieces. So everybody can say it's not my job. And then everybody can blame

1292
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:22,200
everybody else. And then everybody can focus on their little job. Now there is a guy who could

1293
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:28,760
be interesting to interview, I don't know, David Lane, because he did his PhD dissertation on

1294
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:40,040
reframing and he used the same in 2100 as his test case. And he's got brilliant idea. He basically said

1295
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:47,400
if there are environmental problems that we have not been able to solve, we've probably

1296
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:54,520
framed the problem in the wrong way. It's like if I give an exam question to my engineering students

1297
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,480
and at the end of the exam period, all my smart students are still trying to solve the problem,

1298
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:06,120
I'm in trouble because I framed the problem in a way they can't solve. So what he wanted to do

1299
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:16,440
is to look back over the history and find reframings because we will lose them because the

1300
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:22,440
institutions frame the problem in a particular way. So if someone comes along and reframes it,

1301
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:29,560
everybody may say it's a good idea, but he gets lost in the institution. So he developed software

1302
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:35,560
to get indicators of reframing and he could have a software search through with these indicators

1303
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:42,760
to try to find a radical reframing and identify it and use the same in 2100 as an example.

1304
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:47,320
And as indicators go like this and then my paper came out like this, so that's how I got to move.

1305
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:54,520
So he's working over there with international students with English teaching English.

1306
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:01,960
I'm asking a couple more questions about OSU. Your research interests in your contacts,

1307
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:06,760
primary contacts, it seems we're pretty far afield from traditional civil engineering.

1308
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,400
Did you ever feel isolated or like a man at that home on some level?

1309
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,840
Yeah, you do sometimes. The hardest thing over the years,

1310
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,800
people act like, well if you do this, you know, somebody's going to fire you then, that's not the problem.

1311
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:32,600
I, you know, I never had the problem. No, I was fortunate because

1312
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:43,240
maybe because of my family, but I could teach. And so I get real high course evaluations.

1313
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:48,760
So that sort of protected me. And because if you're not bringing in research dollars,

1314
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:56,520
it's going to be pretty hard to survive, but I was able to do that sort of, there's some interesting stories on that.

1315
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:03,320
Well, I'll tell you one story. Some of the Columbia areas that he yesterday studied.

1316
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:13,720
And Guy Daniel Hancock and I were, were some contractors for, I said, this is a dangerous project.

1317
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:19,720
I'm only going to be a subcontractor for the interactions, the biophysical interactions.

1318
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:29,720
How's all this stuff interact? And so we're looking at the project and then mail these grants out there.

1319
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:34,760
And none of it's going to interact because their people are just doing their own thing.

1320
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:42,200
So we come up with a scheme which we develop hypothesis systems.

1321
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:49,240
I said, well, have an annual meeting. And Dan and I put up these hypothesis systems about a problem.

1322
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:57,480
And we'll present it to the whole group. And I said, well, follow the bell of cooking rule.

1323
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:03,000
Anybody who doesn't like it gets to do the next time. Anybody who complain. So you end up with

1324
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,480
these, you know, everybody interacts and we end up with these hypothesis systems. And then you

1325
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:16,840
reallocate the funding based upon whether you're going to actually be able to address these hypotheses.

1326
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:23,800
So it's sort of a learning process. So there's a, in that story, there's going to be a workshop

1327
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:34,360
there. And so the manager of the project, he says, okay, you will meet for the first

1328
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:40,200
after the half of the day. And I'll do the second half of the day or vice versa.

1329
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,520
You'll do half a day. We'll do half a day. So we said, okay, so we prepared this for the citizen's

1330
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:50,680
advisory group. And there are people in there who are fishermen and local people there. I mean,

1331
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,920
they know a lot about the history. They know a lot more than I do, but

1332
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:02,040
so we present this to them. Oh, when we get down there, the manager says, you do the whole day.

1333
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:07,400
I'm not going to do anything. So I think he was thinking he was going to drop something on us,

1334
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:14,600
but actually, he said, great. So we do the workshop. And they loved it because his fishermen,

1335
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:20,680
I mean, they had ideas on this. And we're sketching them out and they said, now we can be involved

1336
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:27,880
in this and we can actually see, you can come to these meetings. And so the meeting ends

1337
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:35,960
and we go out to eat and the manager's there. And I didn't realize we didn't pick up on his,

1338
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,840
we're usually pretty good at picking up on body language, but Dan and I are still talking. We don't

1339
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:49,480
realize how angry he is. Because this means our approach, he has to reorganize the boxes and he's got

1340
01:37:49,480 --> 01:38:00,760
them all lined up. And I didn't realize how angry he was until we're eating and all of a sudden

1341
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:10,200
he loses it. He jumps up and throws his briefcase on me. So which I catch and throw it back at him.

1342
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:18,840
And he storms out. Well, needless to say, we didn't get funded, but the whole project crashed.

1343
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:27,320
But the interesting part is apparently, if I remember right, my promotion committee was meeting

1344
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:36,600
like the week before. So on the record, I had this grant. So I was able to speak by, I guess,

1345
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:42,040
I don't, but I made it. So, but now you were getting by a little strack of the question,

1346
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:49,400
how do I feel it already, Satan? The hardest thing to deal with are the stone face.

1347
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,960
You bring up an interesting idea, something that you think is important, and you get a plan.

1348
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:08,200
Blank. And I noticed this when David Lane would go with me, since you got the stone face.

1349
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:18,120
And I think what happens is I'm not sure what's really going on here, but people become so focused on their

1350
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:29,160
little feel that the grooves in their brain gets so deep and it just doesn't register. Or they may say,

1351
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:34,280
oh, you'll just have to read our literature. It's just, it's just not there.

1352
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:45,000
So it's been sort of a lack of exciting discourse, I think, that's probably been the hardest thing to do with.

1353
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:54,200
That's, and that takes a toll. There is a story on this, David Lane.

1354
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:03,960
David, big lie at the huge guy. No one wants to take him on, so David Shepherd boy comes up.

1355
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:09,640
Sit on, take him on. So first thing he puts on the king's armor and he can't move.

1356
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:17,720
We put on a lot of armor. We can't move either. Like academic citations and references in the

1357
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:23,880
academic language and mathematical equations he can't move. So he takes off the armor.

1358
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:29,320
Goes there, picks up and gets some stones. And of course the story goes,

1359
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:35,480
Slice, go, I have to say, yeah, but what about the other stones? They don't tell you that.

1360
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:41,880
See, they lead parts for years, both of you land. So I'll tell you what happened to the other stones.

1361
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:50,520
First stone. He missed. That's what life is about. You missed.

1362
01:40:50,920 --> 01:41:06,520
So then, second stone. This is, well, he hit him, made a really mad. Okay.

1363
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:16,360
Third stone. So this is the one that's most painful. This is what's worse than hitting him and getting

1364
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:25,720
really mad. Get it? Thank you, shot. Hit him right between the eyes. He doesn't even notice.

1365
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:37,080
And he says, that really wears on for a long time. So I'm at the end of my talk, you know, someone said

1366
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,880
someone who knew the story better. There's another stone.

1367
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:47,480
What? Yeah, there's a fourth one. What did that one do? I don't know. I don't know.

1368
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:54,200
So my wife is there. And I just leave. I come home.

1369
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,000
She goes back and she says, I know what the fourth stone was.

1370
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:10,040
Is the Holy Rolling Stone like a what? She put on this music. And it was from

1371
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:17,880
TV show, John of Arcadia or something that we're got appears to people is the janitor or somebody

1372
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:24,440
like this. And it's like a Holy Rolling Stone. And so I still don't get it. He says, he dropped it.

1373
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:31,160
And it became the Holy Rolling Stone for someone else to pick up. And that's a whoa, that's cool.

1374
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:43,000
But anyhow, the the painful part is often this is being seeing that there are some really

1375
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:51,880
big challenging problems. And then just not being able to sustain this course. That's the hardest part

1376
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:58,200
of the story. We've seen a lot of change in OSU. And this is a season of change for the

1377
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:03,400
university as well. And warning me, just in your perspective, I'm kind of where the

1378
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:11,880
universities come from, where it's heading. Yeah, well, they've done a very good job in the campus

1379
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:21,400
and landscape. I think the campus and landscape is really remarkable. I think they've

1380
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:31,160
really much given up on the idea of educating and learning knowledgeable citizenry. You

1381
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:35,960
have to have discourse in order to do this. I think they're really

1382
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:44,440
very close ties with industry. I think Brian Adams, who was the Dean of Engineering,

1383
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:49,960
very close ties in the industry. He's now, I guess, the vice president or something now.

1384
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:58,360
And it's not that that's bad, but it's sort of like, it's unbalanced. And there has to be some

1385
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:08,360
other role where the university does some unique things that no one else can do. And I think

1386
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:19,960
they've forgotten. And I think a good people embrace good person, Steve Clarks, good

1387
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:29,000
versions. But what I find in the systems is systems of dance. So the people who are very successful

1388
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:36,200
in them, in a sense, become part of the system, far more than they realize. They become not just

1389
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:44,520
in the system, but out of the system. And it's just too easy to start believing your own hype.

1390
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:55,480
And that's sort of danger. And you need scouts. You need somebody, I used to tell President's

1391
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:02,120
custard biggest mistake, a little big horn, as he didn't listen to his scouts.

1392
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,800
And the scouts, somebody who's not fucking for higher position. And the only time you really

1393
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:12,760
need a scout is to tell you something you don't want to hear that you're going in the wrong direction.

1394
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:19,960
You don't need someone applauding the direction you're going in. And so I think there's an absence

1395
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:26,120
of scouts that are out there that are willing to do it. And I consider myself a scout. And

1396
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:32,760
I'm not a leader in the sense I don't have lots of people following me. And I'm not a follower.

1397
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:44,920
I go out and explore. And that's important. So we are testing with, I'm always trying something,

1398
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:53,720
but with one idea. And working with Charlie Vars, former mayor, and economist, and court

1399
01:45:53,720 --> 01:46:03,320
smithing anthropologists, and it has to do with the awarding. And we have many, many, probably thousands

1400
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:11,640
over the years of students from the places particularly China coming here. Very conscientious,

1401
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:19,640
main going back. Let's get it. So the question is, where are they really learning when they come here?

1402
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:29,080
I mean, this place blows their mind. This is totally different. And they're, first of all,

1403
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:35,880
they're wealthy, they're a lot. Okay, so it's not, you know, it's not the peasants coming from China,

1404
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:43,880
but that I grew up with, I mean, by some pretty nice cars. And they're living in a place that

1405
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:50,840
in any place else in the world would be called core heaven. Core palace, I mean, we talk about

1406
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:57,960
our parking process. I mean, compared to the rest of the world, this is nothing. So they're learning

1407
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:04,920
something, like being here. And I think they're learning the wrong lessons. Okay, they're learning,

1408
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:09,000
this is how things are done. And if they're in civil engineering, they're probably being taught

1409
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:20,280
how to do it. So we came up with a proposal. And basically, that Oregon State University and the

1410
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:29,960
city of Gravals in the county would develop some of no car communities. Surve by rail line,

1411
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:35,240
we have an existing rail line. That existing rail line goes north, goes right through the middle of

1412
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:39,800
town, goes through the southern end of campus, and right through a piece of property, bigger than

1413
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:47,400
the campus, the university owns most of it. And then further, okay, you built a clustered,

1414
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:56,040
no car community. I don't know the scale. You want to get a scale that is viable neighborhood scale,

1415
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:01,080
so that if you were building a mega city, that would be sort of the scale in the neighborhood.

1416
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:10,920
Okay, so I don't have a 1500 to 3000 something. And what you do is you involve the students

1417
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:19,720
in the design of this. And in doing it, we are telling them the way we have developed this

1418
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:27,720
has been a mistake. Okay, this cannot continue. And we are going to do it for ourselves. We're not

1419
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:32,520
lecturing you that you ought to do something that we've done, you know, that you shouldn't do what we've

1420
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:40,760
done. What we're doing is we're asking for your help to help sign a viable community here in

1421
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:47,240
Carvals that would involve students involved faculty and some citizens from town. The rail line is

1422
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:52,040
all the way through there. It's already there. How could we use it? What could be the way to do it?

1423
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,640
And what we would do is involve the students in lessons learned. They go look to all of

1424
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:01,800
the world. What were the successes and failures? There's a couple of cities in China that

1425
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:08,680
went just to get to pretty much a walkable city, but there's also some disasters in China.

1426
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:14,680
So you learn from those. Okay, lessons learned. And then you get some of them to start building

1427
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:23,880
a virtual examples of this. They can take towards. There is a program where it's a construction

1428
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:31,000
program. I don't know whether you're familiar. I'm not in the video gaming. But Atlantic had a magazine.

1429
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,520
And of course, it's an imaginary world. You know, monsters and all the restants. But they build

1430
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:45,000
stuff. Why not make a real one? They have 100 million participants in this thing. That's more

1431
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:53,160
there all the university students in the United States. Okay? So what you would do is you make this

1432
01:49:53,240 --> 01:50:00,120
part of their effort. And what they would do is to say, you want to understand the local culture.

1433
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:05,480
This is the university town. We have a campus. Some good examples. How can you build on the

1434
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:13,560
architectural success of a campus? So that when they went back, they'd say, what's the local

1435
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:18,760
culture? How do we build on the success of that local culture? How do we do this? No, we don't need

1436
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:23,800
to have animal bills. And you can serve it in different ways and have viable communities.

1437
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:31,400
So anyhow, we've written up a proposal. So one page both sides. And then we've written a memo

1438
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:37,960
which we gave to Steve Clark. Okay? And I doubt whether it would be when anywhere. But we're going

1439
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:44,200
to start spreading it out. And we've been meeting on this for about a year now every week over the

1440
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:51,960
magic. So we're, we're it's going to go, I don't know. But you know, it's doable. It's doable.

1441
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,560
When you look at, when you look at the satellite photographs, if they could Google,

1442
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:01,640
Google, whatever it is, Earth, Google Earth, you look around and you say, there's a

1443
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:08,920
thing like, it goes right by, right by a parking garage. I mean, how ironic, right by a parking

1444
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,880
garage and that right on through this piece of land, you could have open space, farm space,

1445
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:21,320
all around it. And then there's, there's another one just near fuel at the back. And then you look

1446
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:26,280
at the side of fuel at the back, it is, you know, it's about half parking spaces. Most of the

1447
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:33,560
empty now. Anyhow, that's, that's some of the stuff that will work. Well, my last question for you

1448
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:40,040
is, as you think about the future, are you able to stay optimistic? Okay, this is a good question.

1449
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:51,480
There's a big difference between optimism and hope. Okay. And there's a Cornell West,

1450
01:51:51,480 --> 01:52:00,120
he's a field surgeon for you. And he's black. And he says, I cannot be optimistic

1451
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:09,000
but I am totally hopeful. Hope requires courage to act when doubt is warranted. Okay,

1452
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,600
now David Lane found that when he did his thesis. And when I was in a class, his honest

1453
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:21,400
class, and David Lane presented that to that class, their jaws dropped. And they said, why

1454
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:31,880
hasn't anybody told us that? So optimism, it's, it's, it's hard for me to just be optimistic.

1455
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:39,480
But optimism involves what the Buddhist call attachment, you're attaching to the outcome.

1456
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:45,400
So you don't want to attach to the outcome. I realize an engineering, you know,

1457
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:50,040
it's supposed to attach to the outcome. But engineering can do with big problems and do with a lot of little ones.

1458
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,560
The little ones don't add it, the little ones may be good, but they don't, that doesn't mean that the hole is good.

1459
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:01,720
The world would linear, that would make sense for the world would linear. I can be a great musician,

1460
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:06,360
because I can play great notes on a grand piano, but when I add up all the notes, it's terrible music.

1461
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:18,760
So the world is non-linear. So I'm hopeful, and I'm hopeful, and what you do is you've done

1462
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:25,240
to attach the outcomes, and you do something creative. You try to make a contribution in there,

1463
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:33,880
and you don't, you know, of course sometimes you feel bad if it doesn't work.

1464
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:44,200
But I look back, and if I look at all the failures, if you want to say that they didn't go anywhere,

1465
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:52,120
now some of them did, but, and if I had to do it over again, I do it the same way. So there's no regrets.

1466
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:58,040
So I guess if you approach, you know, I'm 75 now, you approach that is, and you don't have regrets,

1467
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:02,440
and you say, no, I wouldn't trade what I've done with anybody else I know.

1468
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:10,840
That's pretty good, but if, if I ask me, okay, well, I want to just list all your accomplishments.

1469
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,440
No, I, I don't think that's the right question.

1470
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:26,680
Now, again, that gets to be some theological, that, that, in Cornell West, I hope it's a

1471
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:35,080
courage to act when doubt is warranted. And then, I hope also comes as a gift, freely a gift,

1472
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:42,280
but that's what they call grace. So I don't know what I'm going to turn out, but I don't have to know.

1473
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:52,040
Okay, and the idea of prediction and control is just an illusion. It's just, it's just, yeah, yeah,

1474
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:59,320
if you're building a cabin, maybe that's okay, but we're talking about the future, the Earth and society's,

1475
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,880
just, just don't do that. So we need to tell that to the students,

1476
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:09,080
our generation, you should tell it.

1477
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:16,520
Well, thank you very much. This has been a lot of fun, and I appreciate you being so generous

1478
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:22,040
with the time and walking around. Well, I, I would again, anybody who looks at this, that the oral

1479
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:27,720
history is extremely important because there are a lot of things that didn't make it into all the

1480
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:32,040
documents that they're studying. And they may be the important things, it's kind of what

1481
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,640
Sherlock Holmes, the dog, they didn't bark. Okay, the stuff that you don't find, why didn't you find it?

1482
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:48,360
Well, that could be the world, a lot from that. Okay, well good, I appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you.
