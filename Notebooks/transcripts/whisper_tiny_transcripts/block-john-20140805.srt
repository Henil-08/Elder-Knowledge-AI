1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Hey Dr. Bucket, you could please introduce yourself with your name and today's state

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,160
in our location. My name is John Block, today's date is August 5th, 2014, and we are in

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,480
the family room of my house. And we're going to talk a bit about your career in pharmacy

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
and your association with OSU and want to start off at the beginning of your board in

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
the Acomo Washington. That is correct. Is that where you're erased?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, all the way through high school and then Washington State University for bachelor's

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
degrees and master's and University of Wisconsin and Madison for my doctorate.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,360
What were your parents' backgrounds?

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,160
You mean, business wise, education wise, what does it give us a sense of, okay, well my mother

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,960
was born and raised in the Accommonics. It's a funny story. Her parents were, and probably

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,640
the last group of pioneers, they're actually listed in the Acomo Valley Historical Museum

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,160
on some wall plaque with, they actually came out in a pioneer train. They were on a wagon train.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,960
But so she was raised there and born on a farm. I think my granddad was a foreman or something

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,080
like that. It was not his farm. And the interesting thing was, her birth was never registered

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:29,160
because she was a girl baby born out on a farm. And I was not pertinent later on after she was married

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,800
to my dad who I mentioned just a moment. They got a court order. So her is the court order

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,440
of birth certificate, which then paid off when Medicare came along because she could prove her age.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:48,840
My dad was raised in Buffalo, New York. And in those days, there was no state university in New

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,320
York per se. They were the state of New York supported different majors at private schools.

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,560
So I think forestry was at Syracuse, engineering was at Cornell, things like that. And he was

21
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,920
a twin and second born. There he had an older brother and his dad being German.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,440
Said the oldest son was the one who's going to get to go to college. So my dad took commercial

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,880
courses and a senior here in high school, his dad, my granddad told him whether there was

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,480
enough money for him to go to college. Well, my dad sort of said he didn't take the college trip

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,480
courses. So he was not eligible for any New York school. So he went to the University of Pennsylvania

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,400
graduated from the Warden School of Business Administration as my dad said before Harvard stole the

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,160
faculty, hired onto the firestone tire and rubber company. And Harvey Firestone Jr. was in his training

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:58,680
class. And then as he looked for a position to be a firestone tire salesman, he found that the

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,800
Eastern and Washington are actually central Washington District had done very poorly. And he had

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,720
been advised, don't replace every tire in salesman who is real successful because you will go down,

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,800
go to one that is not successful, and you can go up. And he was successful. And he basically,

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,600
I think was headquartered in Yakima, but his territory took him all through Eastern Washington.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,720
And they small-beat towns, close to Washington. I guess over the coal facts,

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,080
maybe up to Spokane that I'm not sure. Met my mother or I guess they were going to a baseball game

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:44,760
somewhere and got married. Draw a model A Ford for their wedding trip back to Buffalo,

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,880
which is where he was then going to work. He resigned from Firestone. And as they've gone,

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:00,440
I guess into Canada, crossing Detroit Windsor, then into Canada, then across the peace bridge

38
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:09,240
into Buffalo. And the immigration customs guide on the U.S. side, of course, asked who they were,

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,440
where they were born. My dad said he was born in Buffalo flying. My mother was very naive

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,600
and said she was born in Yakima. He left after what part of Japan was that? And she didn't have

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,320
a birth certificate as I indicated. Well, then the so-called Chicago, and obviously,

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,160
depression struck. And what people didn't realize was that depression was roughest in the

43
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,800
industrial parts of the United States, because the manufacturing stopped. The people were all laid off.

44
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,760
In the rural areas, things weren't great, but people ate and they bartered. So my dad decided

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,480
we're going to head back out to the state of Washington. And he had business contacts who could

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,600
help him get established. And so that's how he got back west, left Buffalo, and got going

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:04,360
in Yakima on a basic bill of independent fuel, gasoline, distribution, business, fuel oil before

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,720
natural gas had come in. Did you have any siblings? I had my brother died a couple of years ago.

49
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,720
He was eight years older than me. And I say nine, a couple of years ago. He graduated from Washington

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,320
State also, ROTC, back in the days of the Korean War. And there was a draft on.

51
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:37,080
And state in the military got to be a bird kernel. And so actually, I attended and participate

52
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,360
in his internment in Arlington with the full case on band, the whole ceremony.

53
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:55,320
What were you just screwing up as a boy in Yakima? Well, that's interesting. I guess I

54
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:05,320
dabble around photography. I had a dark room. And would shoot pictures. I had a 30-fold

55
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,120
Argusy 335 millimeter camera. I graduated from a brownie, Kodak Brownie. And we'd

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:20,120
develop my pictures. I never did do color, did family photo Christmas cards. Took some of the

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:31,720
pictures around the church I grew up in. And I got on the stage crew. Those days was Yakima,

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,520
senior high school is only high school down those days. And it was also the city Kodakarium.

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,000
That would be a nice Kodakarium, full stage dressing rooms in the basement. And we would be

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,880
those stage crew if we worked for a somebody putting a show on, we would get paid. So I got

61
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,040
fine at a response position. I even got a key to the stage area and learn how to get along

62
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,960
with the janitors. So I was on the stage crew when the Air Force band came through and it was

63
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,720
a stage circus with a little baby elephant in the basement that upset the janitor because he made a mess.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,440
And of course there were the plays and things like that that were put on.

65
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,520
How much year early is it interested in science or in pharmacy? I guess it was just the science

66
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,400
courses that we had to take curriculum in those days was pretty regimented and in high school.

67
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,080
And well even I come out of the air of Junior High. So grade school went through sixth grade.

68
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,920
Junior High was 7th through ninth and high school is 10th, 11th and 12th grades.

69
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:54,840
And had had very good science teachers. They all had master's degrees pretty much in their

70
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:02,200
science and their subject matters opposed to a master's of teaching. And I guess that was

71
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:10,680
how I got my interest. I didn't pick pharmacy right away. I went as an undeclared major at

72
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Washington State and hunted around and went to the counseling center and sort of looked at

73
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,080
that and I thought we like you kind of I kind of had the pre-farmacy curriculum of what I was doing.

74
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,320
And it was one where I didn't think I'd be stuck in a lab. I would know the public well I had

75
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:39,560
up in a lab anyway after grad school and academia. Well tell me about your experience at Washington

76
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:47,080
State's undergrad in the budding pharmacist. Well we lived in there were two political parties in

77
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,360
those days. There were the Greeks and the independence. And there was none of this that

78
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,760
freshmen lived in the dorms their first year. If you pledged you went to your Greek house immediately.

79
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,560
The person who was in charge of the dorms believed in a strong dorm system and loyalty and so forth.

80
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,920
So if you went Greek by God you went to your fraternity or sorority for the women. And of course

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,800
there was no such thing as co-ed dorms. The boys were on one side of the campus and the girls

82
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,920
on the other side of the campus and if you didn't get the girl in on certain times you got a campus

83
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:37,320
and you had to give her a dozen roses which happened to me once. And the dorm I was in was nice.

84
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,760
They were sweets of rooms. They had wash basins in the rooms. There weren't the long hallways.

85
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:53,400
It was I won't call a semi-private but they were nice and they were quiet. That real thick walls

86
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:01,560
between the rooms so plaster on lathe. So it was good and we had a good reputation. We got one of the

87
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,600
higher grade point averages. There was this type of competition and in a mural which I didn't

88
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:16,200
participate and I was my worst sport school was PE. And just as an aside you'll never guess who my

89
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,240
highest one of my two high school physical education structures were a whole break before he went

90
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,680
off to Washington State to be the famous baseball coach he was a high school PE teacher.

91
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,480
What was the curriculum like for you in pharmacy as an undergrad? I've seen it was somewhat

92
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,920
different from what students did. Yeah it was well we had compounding and it had a lot more lab

93
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,600
involved. And so I said we would compound at appointments and creams and suspensions and elixirs

94
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:02,520
and all that type of stuff. Otherwise medicinal chemistry with medicinal chemistry based on what

95
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,760
was known those days. Pharmacology was pharmacology. Pharmacology was pharmaceuticals. It just there

96
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,520
wasn't as much known. The concept of receptor was just that receptor and it never been one

97
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:24,120
and it never been isolated. Drug design was in its infancy which is basically a group of compounds

98
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,400
and just the companies would screen them and if they got hit they got hit. They got hit.

99
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:39,400
The keyfob are amendments have not yet passed so you have to tell in a mind situation occurred.

100
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm trying to remember when the efficacy requirements went in and they screened all the

101
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,000
over the counter drugs and reform laid a lot of them because the brands were popular but they had to

102
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,960
take ingredients out because they couldn't prove they were effective. So I would say the science and

103
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:05,480
the efficacy requirements have greatly increased over the years and now they're of course into

104
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:15,160
all the reevaluating the type of statistics that are used and how much are the companies

105
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,440
and I don't mean this an anti company thing at all because I'm sure some of the same stuff went

106
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,080
on the lab and then university labs too. I'll just look at the number of papers that are

107
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,480
mean retracted nowadays coming out of university labs and institutes and so forth.

108
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,800
But when you throw out a bad study when we're out of the bad study it was probably a very important

109
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,600
study that said something you better be alert to. So I would say there's a lot more

110
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,840
in this day and age of electronic communication and so forth. Many, many ways the public may be

111
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,240
better protected. By the time that you'd finish your wash since day it was pretty clear you're

112
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,640
going to be a pharmacist it seems. What about it? I feel the you what was here. It sparked your interest

113
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:18,520
those in pursuing career in pharmacy. Well I knew I could not do medicine because you know some

114
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,000
only my hands here and there's a slight tremor. I have what's called familial or idiopathic

115
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,080
tremor and hair different grandmother through mother through me and at least in medical school

116
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,880
on those days there was a required surgical rotation and you would not want me to be your surgeon.

117
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,960
In fact in physiology we had to do surgeries on rabbits and we all had to take turns and I didn't

118
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,760
do too well in my rabbit. Unfortunately I had three other people on the team that could bail me out but

119
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,680
I was one of those kids in grade school when testing amazement came along first grade.

120
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,680
I couldn't get my bow tied on my shoe. I really clets it my hands.

121
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,280
So you didn't want me in medicine at a hall or dentistry or anything like that.

122
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:18,120
But I can count or lick and stick. I mean which of course and convey knowledge to the

123
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,520
customer or the client. But the follow-up later became Dean at Washington State

124
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,480
looked at my record and said basically I think you ought to consider graduate school.

125
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,280
So that's just a faculty member took an interest.

126
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,280
So you had to put me off in that direction. You had an interest or it's definitely. Definitely.

127
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,760
We went to Wisconsin briefly after Washington State.

128
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,960
I was there for four years. Right with you. Did you do some post-grad work in it?

129
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,760
Wisconsin right after you finished your bachelor's degree?

130
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,640
I write about that. After I'm in a bachelor's degree and I stayed at Washington State

131
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:05,160
to get my master's. And then went to Wisconsin. I was there for four years and a typical period

132
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,000
time to get a doctor at least in the chemical like pharmacy sciences came here.

133
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,280
So I graduated basically in 1966. Tell me about your graduate training at Washington State names,

134
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,680
Wisconsin. Washington State was a traditional, I mean for the master's was a traditional

135
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,080
medicinal chemistry. I had a research problem. Make a series of compounds.

136
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,880
And I wasn't there if I wanted to be tested. But that was basically it. And of course you take

137
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,960
the appropriate chemistry courses with it. In fact most of the courses were in chemistry except

138
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,640
for an advanced course in drug design. I was in Wisconsin. Did you want me to jump to Wisconsin?

139
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,840
Yeah, one of you ready. Okay. I was concerned again there. They didn't have a court.

140
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,680
It was interesting. I was originally going to work for a different chemist. And he moved on to Kansas.

141
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,520
And I said I ended up in Wisconsin. And that's interesting story. Okay.

142
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,840
God, we'll be able to have a lot of inches on here. I guess it's no longer inches on a table. It's a

143
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:22,600
silica chip. I applied to three different graduate schools. All right. I wrote to three different

144
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:32,120
graduate schools and applied to two, if I remember. I told you the person I was interested in

145
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,440
it. Wisconsin had moved to Kansas at Lawrence. But they sent me old-out-bated catalogs.

146
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,880
So I just shook it off. I had, there were a couple new faculty members at Washington State who

147
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,080
were both Wisconsin grads. So I was sort of getting input from them at the same time. And they knew

148
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,320
the, the personalities at Wisconsin. I applied to the University of California San Francisco,

149
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,040
which is where the pharmacy. That's the medical center, the University of California. The original

150
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,880
medical center for the University of California system. They're more than one now. And applied

151
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,760
there and was accepted with a teaching assistantship. I got accepted at the University of Wisconsin

152
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,760
with a research assistantship. And they, these two, fell of faculty and faculty, system professors,

153
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,960
as grab the research assistantship and you can start right out in your research speed things along.

154
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,360
So I did. And it was very interesting. In late spring, I got a letter from the University of

155
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:44,440
California San Francisco saying they would award me a Smith client of French fellowship.

156
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,160
I think probably I was a runner-up and whoever they originally gave it to,

157
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,680
turned it down and went somewhere else. But by that time I had made my choice and it didn't seem

158
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:08,040
right to back down. And it would have actually been unethical for California to accept

159
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,960
of me then. I don't think they would have cared. But it turned out well. I got my doctor.

160
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,680
I met my wife, this December, would be our 50th wedding anniversary. So it worked out well.

161
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,520
It was constant. Tell me about the environment there. How was it? It was different from what

162
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,400
Washington State. Oh, Wisconsin was definitely a research university. It was definitely a publisher

163
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:42,600
parish for the faculty. The undergrad, as the former dean told me on my exit interview,

164
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,600
he said, you want to understand the role the undergraduate. They provide the tuition

165
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,560
and support so that you faculty can do your research. So treat them nicely.

166
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,560
I mean, there was that no-if I answered lots about it. You got to keep in mind,

167
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,320
Wisconsin had a longer tradition than a lot of the big-tem schools,

168
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,120
because they had the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. So when you drink your glass of milk

169
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,560
with vitamin D and the royalists from that patent have gone to the University of Wisconsin,

170
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,760
if you are using warfront as an anticoagant for a rat poison,

171
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,880
the warfest Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. That was all discovered at Wisconsin

172
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,640
and ought to go so they were in the business full-time, make no mistake about it.

173
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,120
And a lot of us sort of had a reaction too, like, do we want to be a system of

174
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,160
professors in this type of environment? So when the opportunity came to come to Oregon State,

175
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,320
it seemed nice attractive because there was more emphasis on the teaching.

176
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,880
Well, before we go, I see I'm interested in a little bit more in your research as a graduate student

177
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,960
and how I progressed. Well, I went well. I got publications. It was a different type of

178
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,960
problem. It was not a drug design problem. My major professor was actually in the natural

179
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:25,320
products, and he was very successful at it. He, but he had what was called a physical organic

180
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,080
problem. He made his claim to fame by actually, I think, finding an error in a structure that

181
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,680
the late RB Woodward had developed. It was just the only error was in the stereo chemistry. But anyway,

182
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,000
so he wanted to follow up on that. And so basically that was my problem. So I did not have to do

183
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,880
the natural products isolate and hope I got everything done with the 10 milligrams. I could get how the

184
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,000
plant. I could just keep making my com. My simple little compound and keep running tests on him so

185
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:13,560
it was that type of problem. And but otherwise it was a standard graduate university graduate

186
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:20,680
chemistry lab. Plant benches, everybody in their working postdocs and graduate students.

187
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,040
We came to see a 1966 and it's only a bit about the decision to move back to ordering.

188
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,760
It was mainly jobs were kind of tight academic jobs. I had a chance to interview at the

189
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,200
chemical abstract service. That's the American chemical site is the parent of it in Columbus, Ohio.

190
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,000
And I could tell that was all going to get computerized at some point. I thought that would be a

191
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,960
good mix. And I think I would have done well. But this other position came along and

192
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,680
I talked to the major professor and decided to take it. So it turned out

193
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,080
that there was an opening also at the University of Nebraska, which I guess I really wasn't

194
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,760
that aware of. But a person I later knew and he and I became co-authors on the first textbook I

195
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,400
was involved with. And he said, oh, yeah, he knew about the, I'm not sure where he got his PhD.

196
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:31,960
But he knew about the Oregon position and later heard it was got filled in realize it was me

197
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,320
until later we met with comparing notes. And I glad it took Oregon because things have not gone

198
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:48,360
well for pharmacy in Nebraska. They were in Lincoln and they got moved to the medical center in Omaha,

199
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,080
and the provost of mood done was all very pro. Then it was then the Nebraska start half financial

200
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,880
problems. There were two pharmacy schools in Omaha and the governor said, you know, I need one,

201
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,440
why do we let Crayton be it? I don't know what he was so against having one of the state school,

202
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,920
but anyway. So they had budgets cut. They did say the school, but

203
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,040
when budget cuts like that happen and faculty, good faculty aren't going to go there and some leave,

204
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,680
that would not have been a good situation. This has been a growth situation and the pharmacist

205
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,360
goal here has grown professionally and enrolled in two of the professionally. What were your

206
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,160
initial impressions of the University of Corralis? Well, Corralis was a nice beautiful college town,

207
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:54,600
even. I should say even in those days of this. And I like the fact I could even bicycle from Wisconsin.

208
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,280
The interview was weird. I have to say because my colleagues at Madison were going for their various

209
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,960
interviews or talking about these research presentations they had to give and all this and I come

210
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,520
out here and there was no affirmative action. None of that type of stuff. I was hired in the back

211
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:27,880
seat of the Dean's car in the townhouse, Motel, after 24 hours of interview. So anyway, things were

212
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:40,280
like this. So I had a job and my wife was very flexible and she had gone to school out of state

213
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:50,040
so forth as far as her batches and traveled quite a bit. So she was fine. She's enjoyed this town too,

214
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:57,080
very, very much. So climate-wise it's superior to the winners of Wisconsin and then you have the hot

215
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,160
muggy summers with the mosquitoes and Wisconsin. So now this is a very pleasant place to live.

216
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:13,000
How do you characterize the department upon your arrival? Very heavy, teach and orientate,

217
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:20,120
orientate and very, very structured. It was a small faculty. It was no date I believe. It was a

218
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:29,320
school of pharmacy and then I think under President McVickard, it got to be Oregon State University

219
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,920
was not Oregon State College. My god, it was Oregon State University and some of the

220
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:45,240
academic units were colleges and some were still schools and he finally said, look, if I guess he told

221
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,840
the Dean's, I guess, I mean, I wasn't, that if you want to be a college, you can be a college. So

222
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,360
I guess we changed our letterhead. We became a college and that meant we had departments.

223
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:07,960
But there weren't that, I mean, medicinal chemistry had a department head and two faculty.

224
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:18,840
Pharmacidics had a department head and three faculty. Pharmacology had a department head and two

225
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,000
faculty. I mean, it was crazy and I think there was a department of pharmacologists,

226
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,080
which is the old term for natural products and I think they had two faculty. So the Dean didn't

227
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:39,880
have faculty meetings, this was Charlie Wilson. He had department head meetings and so these four

228
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,760
sort of senior colleagues sort of ran the school and the rest of his sort of picked up by

229
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,280
osmosis, what the heck was going on. There we have faculty meetings once in a while.

230
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,520
So was there any sense of the history of the program that had been around since 1898?

231
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:08,440
No, and in your research, you, whatever you can find and I don't mean this negatively, but

232
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:21,480
there was a former Dean, name was Klossam and he committed suicide and I actually had a graduate student

233
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:30,920
who was an undergraduate here at the time that occurred. I don't to this day know exactly what the

234
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:39,320
situation. I obviously had depression of some type and there was some story that he

235
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,960
had run up gambling debts and so forth, but I honestly don't know the truth.

236
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,800
To his credit, he was a Minnesota grad as I understand it and he brought one of the first

237
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:02,920
Rokai Rokai's the National Pharmacy Honor Society, Tory and State, I remember what chapter we are,

238
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,640
but we're one of the very early chapters, is it a fight out tonight? No, no, fight out of the

239
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,680
guy is a pharmacy fraternity, a co-ed. There's no them co-capicide that I was a member of.

240
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:24,600
No, no, Rokai Rx. And there used to be a women's sorority, I think it's fallen by the

241
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,800
wayside, well I know it has an Oregon State and there were a faculty who were fight out of the

242
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,160
guy who wanted, that's why basically fight out of the guy, used to be both fight out of the

243
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,040
guy in capicide, capicide fell by the wayside and fight out of the guy is been the predominant

244
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:48,920
and I haven't sure how active it is anymore, but Rokai still initiates top students each year.

245
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,640
There is also a leadership group which is fairly new, and I don't know what it is and I

246
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:04,680
get, I think it Rokai do a joint induction ceremony to spring a Los Alster word or CH2MHL

247
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Center somewhere like that. So, after Closen died, they brought in Charlie Wilson who had been

248
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,360
at Minnesota and was down at Texas and he was co-author of a very famous well-established, became

249
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,800
very well-established, medicinal chemistry, textbook, it was Wilson and Gisold and only Gisold was also

250
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,520
at Minnesota, they started at Minnesota and it was the first. So when I had as an undergraduate even

251
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,360
and the later it got to be multi-authored, I ended up being a co-editor for a couple of years

252
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:57,000
of an author of a chapter two for one or two additions. Anyway he came and his idea, he was told

253
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,680
he was supposed to try to start increasing the research capability. So he was hiring young

254
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,880
faculty at a graduate school, there was a new pharmaceutical person, it was a pharmacologist,

255
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:15,400
got a good grant fairly early. I never was able to get anything big. I would get smaller grants.

256
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,800
And the pharmaceutical experts went off the industry and it was a didn't own house.

257
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:31,560
There was an addition to the building made. That was just going on. When I interviewed,

258
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,760
they were in the finishing state, I came in December for that was the Christmas break.

259
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,800
And in fact, you know how you usually paid it, bring a person out for interview.

260
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,400
No, I took my wife to Yakimo for the first time at Christmas time. After Christmas, we drove down

261
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:59,720
to took my mother's car and drove down to Corvallis, went through the interview.

262
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,120
I think I might have got reimbursed from my lease later. He did pay first,

263
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,280
staying in a motel on the way back because there have been quite a bit of snow. So,

264
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,680
got me cheap as far as there was no this hiring startup money, start up your lab,

265
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,080
all this time. But to answer the question, when I came, the faculty had

266
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,240
were scared around campus because of the addition. So, when I arrived in September,

267
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,400
they were all back in the new building. And the labs were set up. And I see that it was pretty impactful,

268
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,200
in these ways. Potentially, yes, it did start some research going and they started to see some

269
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:55,560
increase in graduate students. All of those were speaking to Department of Pharmacy Administration

270
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,920
with maybe one other faculty member at the New Harvard ad, I'm not sure if I made it over to.

271
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,840
There's interesting story that goes, Charlie Wilson worked very hard to get that addition put on.

272
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,200
And he got approval, I guess, eight, but those days, it definitely had to go through a

273
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:24,680
legislature. And the new offices are all to be labs with few hoods and the faucets and the gas outlets,

274
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:34,520
and so on. He went to NIH, money was a lot more plentiful from the federal government of those days.

275
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:43,240
He went to, and I think it was NIH, makes sense. And got a grant to outfit these offices as labs.

276
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,960
An unbelievable, the state said, we've budgeted X amount of money. Since you got this federal money,

277
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,880
we're going to subtract the state money. And so, he sat down the plans and put X's through

278
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:09,080
marking out which lab labs and which ones would not have few hoods. Did you get one that had a lab?

279
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:16,360
I had one that had a hood because I was a new young assistant professor. But that's how strange things were

280
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:23,880
in Oregon, for example. Which department were you in? Either we were called medicinal chemistry

281
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,400
or pharmaceutical chemistry, I forgot which. At the industrial level the term pharmaceutical

282
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,280
chemistry is what's in the academic level. We might call pharmaceutical. It's just formulation.

283
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,160
And the drug design is in medicinal chemistry. But in academia, it's seen like pharmaceutical

284
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:50,360
chemistry with the drug design area. So what were your responsibilities in this initial position?

285
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,800
Well, I was surprised. I was going to be teaching a lab in medicinal chemistry. I didn't think there

286
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,720
was such a thing left. So I taught a lab in medicinal chemistry. Which took a lot of time.

287
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Was this what you need by such a thing that was left? Is this sort of an older approach?

288
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:20,120
Yeah, yes. Oh yeah, they did very side-billed. I honestly gosh cannot remember

289
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:28,760
where these experiments came from and so forth. But we slow it took years to get rid of that lab.

290
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,280
We I did not teach in the farm. We had a pharmaceutical analysis course and there was a lab in that.

291
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,880
And those labs slowly disappeared as more didactic material got into the course.

292
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,200
I ended it starting the second year. I taught the biochemistry course because that was my

293
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:00,520
minor at Wisconsin. And the story on that is very, very interesting. I see a smile so

294
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:09,160
maybe you know part of the story. The dean and one of the other senior faculty had

295
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,200
daughters, I think both daughters, who were in pharmacy and were really

296
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,080
complain about the quality of instruction from the Department of Biochemistry.

297
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:28,360
It used to be biochemistry and bio physics. And one of the complaints was that each quarter

298
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:37,160
they would keep changing instructors and this would happen each year. So over in the pharmacy

299
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,560
school you couldn't get a reading on what was being covered when the students coming in who had

300
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,320
had the biochemistry course because there was this rotation of instructors going on. It was a service

301
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,920
course. And the pharmacy students would start to complain when they're kind of a cohesive bunch.

302
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,480
And that made the biochemistry faculty angry. And finally the dean says I'm going to yank the course.

303
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,080
Start teaching at John and try to make it unique. Well they had a rule in those days.

304
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:17,240
There was to be no duplication of course work on campus. And they really got a tight about it.

305
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,160
But I did and I started with a course towards a clinical approach and a nutrition approach.

306
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,960
So I started to change a lot of stuff in the biochemistry. Still went through intermediary

307
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:37,400
metabolism. We still went through protein chemistry. No labs though. Chemistry carbohydrates.

308
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,400
And then what was known about DNA and RNA? And of course that is mushroomed. But I picked up and

309
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,440
started to cover diabetes. The biochemistry or diabetes. The biochemistry of hyperlipidemia is

310
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,200
before there was much known about hyperlipidemia. I think everything was cholesterol in those days.

311
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:02,600
And so on. And then I wrote a paper for the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education

312
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,920
on a clinical approach to teaching a biochemistry. Most successful paper ever wrote all my

313
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,200
100 reprints disappeared. They all got requested. I gave an oral presentation at the American

314
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:22,840
Association called to the pharmacy. And it was packed. I was on a rule. It was not what you call research.

315
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,920
Well, the chair of biochemistry and other faculty member came over to have a meeting and said

316
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,680
do we teach that? Well, I didn't teach that approach. And they find it up and we just want you

317
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,400
know that we teach it too. But you go ahead and teach your stuff. Okay. I got along actually with

318
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:53,480
most of them over there. Fine. We got along. But every so often it would come up one of the

319
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,200
faculty members over Dixon in the dressing room and it came up. His faculty members in pharmacy

320
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,400
and this other this fellow in biochemistry says, so how come it is you keep teaching that biochemistry

321
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:13,320
course. There was a physical chemist in our living room. I wife was very active with American

322
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:21,320
field service AFS and there was a group in our living room and the physical organic chemist said,

323
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,000
all of a sudden, you know, you really have no business teaching biochemistry. It wasn't even

324
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,400
a department. You know, that's really solar along the line. I had a different reputation,

325
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,960
different parts of the canvas I guess. It's kind of fun. But I can once you get tenure what they're

326
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:49,720
going to do, you know. But eventually when we went to the doctor pharmacy program

327
00:38:50,120 --> 00:39:04,120
we met with the Chris Matthews chair of biochemistry and basically they took the course back and it was a

328
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:12,360
higher level course that we had to student send rather than the service course. I told him what I was

329
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:19,560
going to continue teaching, which was the nutritional aspects and some of the diseases and

330
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,680
they said fine can aim our students. Come on, I said sure. I don't think I ain't never did. But

331
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,960
so everything was fine. My understanding now what they have done is they're only requiring the first

332
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,760
two years first to some quarters of biochemistry because we're still on the quarter system.

333
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,840
And I'm not sure how they're handling the molecular biology. It has changed so much and

334
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,480
with the heavy research emphasis, the faculty are extremely focused doing their teaching.

335
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,360
So you and you get such a turnover of faculty going on in the biochemistry and that's our courses too.

336
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,440
There's a very rare where you'll see one faculty member sees a course from again and they'll

337
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,400
be a course coordinator. Could basically the job is to make sure the grades get submitted on time

338
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,520
to the registrar. So there's a lot of this. You might say it's a medical school model. It's going on.

339
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,160
Did it seem that pharmacy was resistant to change in terms of the curriculum early on or

340
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,200
no, in fact, just the opposite weeks, you like what always had curricular upheavals.

341
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,240
And that was going on nationally too. There are these trends that you got to change the

342
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,200
clinical pharmacy. You got to do this, you got to do that, you got to put in communication skills,

343
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:50,200
you got to put in cultural sensitivities. Yeah. Oh no, no, no. There's

344
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,760
it was always in state of flux. Always going through transitions. And what do you do about a student who

345
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,120
was not right in sequence and the curriculum changed? What do you do for them? No, no, no.

346
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:10,360
That's just the opposite. We're very fluid. Tell me about setting up your research. It was you.

347
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,800
That got off to a slow start. I basically had some undergraduates and I really had trouble

348
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,840
getting going. I did one based on my Ph.D. and got the paper published.

349
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,120
But I was always fascinated in what's called quantitative structure activity relationships.

350
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:45,080
And it's a statistical method of drug design. And I end up with a graduate student named Doug Henry,

351
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,240
who was very good at statistics. And that's basically what Doug is where I got the bulk of my

352
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:58,920
papers. I had a couple of the graduate students and got papers. But overall, I basically got into

353
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,040
the drug design area and was published in that area and it would go off to the Gordon Research

354
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:15,960
conferences. It started to get a little bit of money from the Army. It was not the chemical warfare

355
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:26,760
bunch that type. And go back to their research conferences and did certain things with them.

356
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:35,320
I mean, published and nothing was classified. And I made a contact at a Gordon conference.

357
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:43,000
So let's say it was that. So that's the best way I did. I don't have that many papers.

358
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,200
And I'd never really got any real big grants. I think the biggest ever goes 10 or 12,000.

359
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,920
Was the model pharmacy? The model drug store still around?

360
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,040
Oh, when I came, well, that there was a prescription lab. And they had cubicle. So the students learned

361
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,080
a dispense. And there was phones. And there's some faculty member or a graduate student

362
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:15,960
to a function as a doctorate fine in prescriptions. So there was still that. Yes, but that's disappeared.

363
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:24,200
What was your sense of the climate on campus when you arrived in the sixties preceded in

364
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:34,120
sort of well, when I bicycle onto the campus that late September, first day of classes,

365
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,160
there was a group of freshmen and green beanies. And I was dumbfounded. I could not believe this.

366
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:50,200
Because I've been to Washington State. It was not such thing as green. I mean, it was just a regular university.

367
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:58,360
I could not believe it. It was a cow college. It was an ex-school.

368
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:07,000
When I saw the PhD curriculum, it was loaded with coursework. And the story goes.

369
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,120
And I want to emphasize story because I never heard it face to face. But the dean of the graduate

370
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,400
school on those days believed in lots of coursework because he knew that Oregon State PhD graduates

371
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,320
were not going to go to the big research universities. They were going to go to the smaller schools

372
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,880
and be teachers. So they need to take a lot of coursework so they could teach a number of subjects.

373
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:39,240
Oh, that's interesting. When, obviously, I knew I wanted to get canured. And in my third year,

374
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:46,120
I got a letter from the President of the University Dr. Jensen saying, you have canured.

375
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:58,120
I like this. I like this place. Okay. I wasn't promoted yet, but I had tenure after three years.

376
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:13,160
Oh, no. Okay. Then he retires and goes off with the Rockefeller Foundation somewhere.

377
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:28,120
And they bring in President McVicker, Robert McVicker, who was a one-man show. There's no question

378
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:35,000
about it. A one-man show. Turned out he was a member of our church. And so at our annual church

379
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:43,640
picnic, he was there with his wife. And there was a, oh, a shoot faculty member who was taken around

380
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,360
and introduced. And so I got introduced to him. Well, it turned out that I had learned ahead of time

381
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,080
that yes, he was a graduate at the University of Wisconsin. His PhD's in Biochemistry.

382
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:00,440
And a person who I actually taught my major professors course to the undergraduate at the

383
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,680
Wisconsin. And there was an individual, it was on sabbatical from industry, a man named A Perlman,

384
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:12,040
who was just a gentleman. And he gave the bottom of lectures in this course.

385
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,080
And somewhere along line, A Perlman told me, oh, Mac, there's my professor was called,

386
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:25,240
and I, we're graduate students in the same lab in Madison. Say a little to him.

387
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,560
And then Perlman, we later became dean at Wisconsin. So here I am at medium president of the

388
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:42,040
vicar. And I said, yeah, I know a day of Perlman. Oh, and he's now keeping, he's both dean

389
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,720
and maintain his research program. And Mac's comment was, well, it's only dean of a pharmacy school.

390
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,760
I went back into old dean of Wilson. I said, you got a problem. You got a big problem.

391
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:04,680
He didn't have a problem that turns out. I mean, he went on business retirement so forth.

392
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,800
No matter, everything is said, I've never heard of Mac fire anybody without due cause, but what happened

393
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:18,920
getting on back to my own personal. I went up for promotion and it was turned down.

394
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:27,400
This is happening all over campus because he wanted a standard dossier where you use outside

395
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,120
referees. Well, it threw my department and he didn't know what to do. But to Wilson's credit,

396
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,440
Dean Wilson's credit, who had been at Minnesota and at Texas, he knew exactly where Mac was coming

397
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,560
from and what had to be done. He said, okay, here is what we are going to do. We got the outline.

398
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:58,120
I need outside referees. And so I may have professors at school's function and for him.

399
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:07,080
And then I got, I did get promote the next time around and then made it to professor on the first

400
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:15,880
time around on that. So, but that was happening all over campus and not only were young faculty

401
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,560
in shell shock, but you had department heads who had never been turned down. All they did was

402
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:31,160
try to let her say they wanted it. So, and so promoted, continued and it was done. You had Dean

403
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:39,400
who had never been turned down and it was, you look back on your lap, but oh yeah, it was a traumatic

404
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:46,680
time. There was no question about it. But the result was Oregon State University today.

405
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:57,640
And what I never have understood is why there's no building or anything like that named after him.

406
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:04,520
There are young faculty, I have no idea who he, who Mac was. And you give them a lot of credit

407
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:10,920
for repelling University for it. Oh, I would say he, without him, we would still be second

408
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,120
fiddle to the University of Oregon. And I mean, real second fiddle. I think promised they could be

409
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:26,600
ahead of us. No, he knew what had to be done and he pushed. And that's, he is, as one

410
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,320
person that he was his own provost, we had to be in a faculty in those days. They didn't think

411
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,880
of Dean was who was kind of the good cop. The Mac was the bad cop as the president of

412
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:48,600
the university. But I know, I know, I know, I know, and he had it quite a temper, but he could flare.

413
00:49:51,320 --> 00:50:00,920
But I, I don't know if anybody who is out out fired, who locked horns with him, he just let fly

414
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,040
and, uh, but I, I just, I don't know if anybody who was, and I'm not saying there wasn't,

415
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:16,520
but he really followed protocol when we did not grant tenure to a faculty member. Boy, he wanted

416
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:25,000
to make sure everything was dotted and he reviewed it carefully. I think one thing I did when he

417
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,720
lost it was obviously, but I think he, I think basically, if you were right about this fellow

418
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,080
who was a president for a long time at Boston, I want to say Boston, he did at Boston College

419
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,760
of Boston University, Silverman, John Silverman, and there's a review in the Wall Street Journal

420
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,800
of a book he had written. Well, he's dead not so much when a couple of your few years ago.

421
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,880
But he, he brought the school, that school, up into a major research university in higher

422
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:59,960
top notch faculty. And he believed in academic freedom, but he also wanted to bleed in excellence.

423
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,520
And, uh, it caused the real transformation. And I kind of look at the, the two people,

424
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:14,200
Mach never wrote a book, as far as I know, uh, as the two of the same type, they had this goal,

425
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,480
and they know it could be done. And if I get the right faculty, I know it could be done.

426
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,760
And he basically did. What does he remember about him as a person?

427
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,480
And it sounds like you knew him a little bit when I kind of a first and a little.

428
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,200
He was very distant.

429
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,520
And I say we're in the same church, and he just never seemed to let his guard down to

430
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,960
after he retired. He just lived over here a couple of blocks away.

431
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,880
And one day after he retired,

432
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,240
uh,

433
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,080
I don't know if he's here with a petition for us to sign or what, but he showed up to the house,

434
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,120
come on in, sat down on the couch out there,

435
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,800
and just talked. He even talked about being hired and things, he'd just,

436
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,680
everything was fine. He was retired now. There was no, there was no barrier between us.

437
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:15,320
There was a neighborhood dessert from our church, and we got the thing mixed up on the counter.

438
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,800
So we, why I'm not push the tour bell. And he said, well, we're here for the dessert.

439
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,400
Well, that was last night, his life's going to be as a boat, guys. He says, come on in.

440
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,800
I think we have some pie, we have some cake, and his wife is always very gracious.

441
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,840
And we sat down and visited for a while.

442
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:45,160
Well, said, one of the colleagues of yours were important to you. It OSU,

443
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,520
other within pharmacy or elsewhere. Well, that was at the Department of Head, Bob Dorgie,

444
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:57,960
who was very good. One that we were basically parallel to each other was George Constantin.

445
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,920
Who's here? I mean, he's over Albany, but he's not alone. You could always interview.

446
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:19,560
Let's see. As far as contemporaries, I would say, those two, for the most part.

447
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,600
In doing some research on pharmacy, it's sort of more recent here,

448
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,000
is that a couple of names that have stood out as people who have made an impact on me.

449
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to speak one more.

450
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,440
The dean, who, the gentleman who replaced Charlie Wilson and Stico, who was there for a long time.

451
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:47,160
Yes. And he once, he said, John, how would you like to be on the board of pharmacy?

452
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,800
And I thought, okay, that sounds like an intriguing deal, because I wasn't setting a world

453
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,120
on fire, research wise, and this is a state board of pharmacy. Yes, a state board of pharmacy.

454
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:09,560
So I think I put my name in and the old guard and the profession that we're not going to have

455
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:16,600
I think I remember on the board of pharmacy. It's ridiculous. And the bank can take him up again.

456
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,680
He says, let's make another run at it. And I don't know what I have behind the scenes, but I got

457
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,160
a point at the board of pharmacy. The old goldsmith. Now he didn't know me from out of

458
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,960
it's all done by the appointments office. And they, of course, checked politics. The board of pharmacy

459
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:39,560
was sure it was not on the goldsmith's political radar screen. So I got on the board and it was

460
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,920
a executive director on the board, Ruth Banderbeer, who had a real vision where pharmacy could go.

461
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,400
She had basically been the author of the revised pharmacy practice act, which gave

462
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,920
pharmacists a lot more responsibility in the state. And I started to go to National Association

463
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:07,080
of the Board's Affirmacy and Regional Meetings, ended up offering a couple resolutions.

464
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,000
Got on to task force of the board, ended up being on one of the permanent committees of the

465
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,440
National Association Board of Pharmacy and one of the exam committees for foreign pharmacy graduates.

466
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,680
So that, I would say, Dick had a real impact. I was on the board for the mandatory eight years.

467
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:31,480
When I say a mandatory, you can't exceed eight years. And was president of the board twice.

468
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:41,560
I was asking about a couple of fellows from the pharmacy department or the school pharmacy,

469
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,280
but it sounded like it made it an impact through their research and one of them is James Ayers.

470
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,240
Oh, yes, yes. He was on sabbatical somewhere and I got a call from Professor Sandeen,

471
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:04,120
a microbiology. And I want to say it's Bill Sandeen, but I may have the first name wrong,

472
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:12,120
but anyway Sandeen. And he wanted some way to develop some method of buffering

473
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:18,440
bacterial cultures in the cheese making process. And I said, well, in the formulation person is

474
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:25,640
Jim Ayers. And so Jim comes back and they meet each other and they kept quite a collaboration going

475
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:32,360
and had one of the most successful patents of that era. And you may still, and I don't know if

476
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,320
the college is still getting some money. And of course, Jim getting some money. This is the time release.

477
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:44,040
Time release, yes, right. Yeah, Jim had, he had, he developed industrial contacts,

478
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,920
and he probably had one of the biggest graduate programs. He believed he's completely retired

479
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:56,840
on the coast now. And they no longer have a home here in Corvalle. I love Lee and Gerwick. Oh, yes, yes.

480
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:06,360
He and I actually co-taught in the Biochemistry course, but Bill developed a fabulous natural

481
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:12,280
products. And was eventually hired away by the University of California, San Diego,

482
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,320
but he had a large program, a very large program. He took a sabbatical in 1972 of Carl's

483
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:28,840
Rassy. Yes, only about that. Well, I want to take a sabbatical, people do. And so we arranged

484
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,440
for the house to be rented by, I think, a couple that was on sabbatical from somewhere else. And

485
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:43,480
went down state, rented a house by the University, over Polish couple who had not been back

486
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,840
to Poland since the second World War. And I think family there. Anyway, so I worked in Carl's Rassy's

487
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,000
lab. He's quite an individual. And of course, the father's birth control pale, so on.

488
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:06,280
And got four papers out. It was a natural products lab, because without we're going to get

489
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:14,680
really secret going. And we had various ideas. And somehow we never could happen to that well

490
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,760
into the Sea Grant money here. But we thought we could get a marine natural products thing going.

491
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,560
And never did work out. But yeah, it was a good year. Did you get to know him very well?

492
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:40,680
You, he's one of these people that has a fantastic memory. So he got to know you more than

493
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:51,160
you got to know him. I mean, I was working on one of the papers. And I said, I've been, I've been,

494
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,800
I've been the camera abstracts. I'm not finding this reference. He got up and went over to his cardfile,

495
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:01,720
pulled out something from Donas, I hold that paper, but it says here. And he didn't do it in a way

496
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,600
that I felt like shrink in the floor. And I, I don't know how I missed this. Well, I always said,

497
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,120
there, you didn't have computerized search in a camera abstracts in those days. It was all done manually

498
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:23,320
with big thick volumes and fine print. But anyway, he came up here once he retired as a chemist

499
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:32,200
and has written three or four novels and some plays sort of a Renaissance man I'd have to say.

500
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:40,040
And he came up, I can't remember who brought him up. But I went over and during the break,

501
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:48,600
I reintroduced myself. He seemed to remember who I was. He was friends with Linus Pauling who's also

502
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,720
in the Stanford area at the time. Yeah. And I can't remember if I did go over here when Pauling's

503
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,800
lectures are not. Pauling came back to campus a few times too. You know, it was you.

504
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:07,960
Yes. Oh yeah. And the only time I heard him on campus that I'm aware of, I can't remember if I

505
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:16,360
went to any of the peace lectures later on, then after Magnus wife. But there was that one time when

506
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:22,600
the Afro-American football players walked off the campus because of the beard incident with

507
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,440
our in Mustaches and with D Andrews, the football coach. And Pauling was to

508
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:36,760
speak at Gil Call of Sam and the students came in and Jensen was president. It was of

509
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:45,800
it was an awkward situation. And I think Jensen felt very hurt by it because I think basically

510
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:54,280
it was a very fair man. But you're dealing with a powerful football coach who had powerful alumni

511
01:00:54,280 --> 01:01:00,520
behind him. So it was an awkward situation. And I'm probably when he had to give us talk.

512
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:08,760
You mentioned Dean of all, he was Dean for 22 years. The longest serving Dean of his generation

513
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,960
in pharmacy apparently. It sounds like there were at least a couple of changes that he

514
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,240
invoked. And one of you mentioned a little bit was that emphasis on increased experience in patient care.

515
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:29,160
But that was going on during the, I would say that that was a trend in pharmacy education all

516
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,400
across the United States. I mean, he was going to make sure we stayed current.

517
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:39,160
As part of that, the curriculum added clinical components, including can actually be turned out

518
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:46,360
awesome. I'll tell you why. Act 2. Yeah. So we were talking about changes in the curriculum and

519
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:53,320
the focus on clinical components, including communication skills. Yeah, the history of

520
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:02,040
communication has been a very interesting one. For a long time, the pre

521
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:11,320
pharmacy curriculum had some type of speech requirement. And the question was always what is the appropriate

522
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:17,800
type of speech requirement? Is it it? So I think the word is expository speech where you get

523
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,080
up and give you three minutes speech or your five minutes speech, which is not what pharmacists do.

524
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,840
They talk one in one like you and I are talking to each other. And so what you want is,

525
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,760
they're there apparently. It was a speech course that supposedly you was more

526
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:41,400
how to interact one on one rather than with an audience. I'm not sure if there's still a speech

527
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,680
requirement in the pre pharmacy curriculum or not. It wasn't there when I was an undergraduate.

528
01:02:46,680 --> 01:03:01,320
I can tell you that. I had an high school. But what happened was, was mandatory

529
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,440
counseling. In fact, I was on the board of pharmacy when the mandatory cost of their

530
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,600
requirement went in. And it was happening across the United States. Part of it was patient,

531
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,880
better patient care. Part of it was, get the pharmacists out there talking with the patient,

532
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:22,840
rather than hiding behind the counter and having some sales clerk hand on that all. So,

533
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:31,400
one of our, I get to call it, in fact, in my recent director of student health, so it was pharmacy

534
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:40,040
billed voice. And actually pioneered the technique for how to console a patient. And there's a

535
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:46,680
little card. And there's three questions on it. I can't remember all of them. Now, they went.

536
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:54,360
But basically, it was, what did your physician tell you about this medicine? So, your first of

537
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,720
all, rather than get through this lecture and I'm trying to find out what the patients understand.

538
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,640
So, you're not talking down to them. And that's also a good way to do an air checking

539
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,120
in the last minute, because if you're handing them an antibiotic and the patient says,

540
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:18,840
it's for my high blood pressure, you know, just hang on a moment. We're going to check this out.

541
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,520
But okay, we'll see what's the correct prescription.

542
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:31,480
Another question might be, what did, and any, could elaborate on the response? Or, yes, I see,

543
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,520
you have a good understanding. What did the physician explain to you on how to take it?

544
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:43,640
And you find out, do they realize they are to take it? Four meals, or two hours after a meal.

545
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,160
And I can't remember the third one, whether you have any other questions, you want to ask me,

546
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:58,440
or did the physician explain any of the pertinent side effects? And there you're trying to,

547
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:05,480
you're not trying to scare the patient, or they'll never take it. But you might also, or if you

548
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,880
do get a certain type of sensation, you need to either call your physician or call us,

549
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,560
rather than simply go up and give them a spiel. So, you're trying to teach that type of

550
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,760
communication on a one-to-one basis. Most deformities are not even set up forward, so you're trying to

551
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,440
have some place in a corner where nobody else can hear the conversation, but

552
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,240
to be an out noise to the store is, Fred Meyer, the product can't hear it because of all the noise,

553
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:41,480
right as I think you can hear the conversation. I have a silly question, but probably when

554
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,480
you've been asked before, how do pharmacists interpret the handwriting of doctors unless the

555
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:52,760
scripts that they receive? A lot of it is practice, a lot of it is now electronic transmission,

556
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,120
and one of the most important things is, fallen and find out what it is that was written.

557
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,400
So, there isn't any secret code in other words? No, no. And they're not supposed to write in

558
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,560
Latin anymore in fact, yet I don't know the Latin. It's kind of moving to your career.

559
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:17,720
I will, one of the, one of the resolutions that we find I got through the National Social

560
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,480
Board's Affirmacy was the test to spoke in English. Not written English, they're supposed

561
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:30,040
to do that also. spoke in English, and I was very interesting to see the opposition. And of course,

562
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:35,320
there was all this about a political correctness, but you had to explain that the communication

563
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:48,040
media is, you could have a resident at a medical center who is from one country in Asia,

564
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:56,040
talking to a pharmacist who is from India, and the only thing they've got in common is the English

565
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:03,400
language. Not saying the Asia one may be that is good and English is the Indian one, but the point

566
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:15,080
is airline pilots and the control towers use English. So, now if a person of pharmacist is dual

567
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:22,440
language, so they can talk in another language and explain the directions or hand the person

568
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:30,120
information sheet in the native language, some of the computer programs will do that. Great,

569
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:39,800
that's excellent, but still got to, still got to be able to speak it. I want to ask you about

570
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,160
you serving an National Science Foundation panel for instructional scientific equipment.

571
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,760
I did, you're right, we're going to have that held down, I think Los Angeles,

572
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,800
I think we all went down there. It was for undergraduate research, and it was a very interesting

573
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:02,760
panel's one time I did, and I'm not quite sure how my name got in there. God, I never got funded by it.

574
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:13,240
I'm not sure if I replied, but what was fascinating was you had good solid liberal art schools,

575
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,560
the Lewis and Clark, and this day to Lewis and Clarks, the reads, the Willamets, for example,

576
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:28,680
applying for, they wanted a new NMR, a new updated infrared species,

577
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:34,840
putometer for their lab, they would be used and they outlined the courses that would be used in,

578
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,200
and also how it works for undergraduate research projects. And we, oh, and they would also

579
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,280
be able to show how they would be able to support the instrument that they had the technicians

580
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:54,360
available to keep it going or experience faculty, and you'd fund those. Then you would get

581
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:03,080
a little small liberal arts college that maybe had one chemist, two if they were lucky,

582
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,480
who wanted this fancy piece of equipment, and you'd say, how are they going to maintain it?

583
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:15,480
Do you understand how it works? Where is the course that's going to be used in?

584
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:21,000
We wouldn't fund it. Are you got the application from the chemistry department at the

585
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,320
University of California or the University of Wisconsin and Madison, who just had to have the new

586
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:34,280
hot, hot, hot, hot NMR, and they were going to let the integrators walk by and say,

587
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:40,120
no, we didn't fund that either. So we basically funded

588
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:46,600
liberal arts program. Well, I didn't have to be, I'm sorry, I don't want to imply,

589
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:53,640
I had to be a private liberal arts school, a school like Western probably would not have any

590
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,920
problem either. They had to have a substantial, we were doing the chemistry area now, please,

591
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:05,240
keep that in mind. Speaking of the discipline, they had to have a core of faculty.

592
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,160
A one thing that really helped them was we did they have a program that met the undergraduate

593
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:16,360
standards of the American Chemical Society, which means they had to have, and that had basically

594
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,440
faculty in each of the disciplines, organic, physical, and political.

595
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,440
It's a seemingly important point in the modern history of the College of Pharmacy

596
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:36,040
came in 1988 when the satellite campus was formed in OHSU. That is still a dynamic situation.

597
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,800
The Oregon State, like some of the other pharmacy schools of history, historical,

598
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,520
are not out in a campus where there is a medical center.

599
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:54,760
And then the big debate is does the school move to where the medical center is or is the school

600
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,360
state where it is and try to do the satellite campus? And of course we did the latter.

601
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:13,240
Part of it is how would you move our whole research emphasis and productivity? We are very

602
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,800
productive. If you take a look at the amount of grant money, this pharmacy school is now a bringing in.

603
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,200
Where would, how would it be situated? Where would be the, the supporting infrastructure? I mean,

604
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:30,200
there's quite a dynamic support all across campus. There's the mass spec centers. There's the

605
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:35,560
NMR centers and so forth. So there's, there's a real big synergism on a campus like this.

606
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,520
And so how would that be handled in a Portland area? Because there's not a major,

607
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:46,360
excuse me, Portland State, but there's not a major research university. Their Portland State

608
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,880
is got some real strong areas, don't please don't misunderstand me. And OHSU is a medical center.

609
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:03,800
They're not teaching the basic science courses that would feed into a medical center.

610
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,920
The students all come in for some more else. So that's one thing.

611
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:21,800
So initially it was to get the clinical program established up there for the fourth year

612
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:29,320
and try to get rotations. And that took a lot of missionary work. You might say

613
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:35,560
to get the medical center to accept. It seems to be working very well now. It really is. And of course,

614
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:43,480
there's both the medical center OHSU and there is the VA. And there's the other big hospitals,

615
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:57,800
legacy, Providence, Kaiser. There is, I'm trying to think of basic pharmaceutical

616
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:03,800
sciences and I have the impression that one emphasizes only an impression that there is some

617
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,680
pharmaceuticals now up in Portland as opposed to just the clinical.

618
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:15,720
Well another important moment came 11 years later when OHSU decided to log it off for the

619
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:23,000
bachelor's degree in pharmacy and focus solid on the farm D. Oh yes, that's got a very interesting

620
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:33,640
history. The question was, was money for one thing to finance because you need an additional

621
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,720
faculty, particularly in the clinical area. And you had to pay going wages because they could all

622
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:48,040
work in the private sector. So the question came up and I remember Dick talking about Dick

623
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:55,160
Ophon, talking about it was, do we start a small farm D program and just kind of shoehorn it in?

624
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:02,200
And there was some type of educational coordinating committee that was they had to approve new programs

625
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:08,200
to eliminate duplication. I think it's passed by the way so I know. In the chair of that committee

626
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:15,320
made the comment, he says, no, you wait until we can have a good program. We want excellent

627
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:23,320
program. The other thing they did that at the state level was saying you can't have a doctor

628
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:28,440
a professional doctor program unless the students have a bachelor's degree. And there are these

629
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:34,120
pharmacy schools, unfortunately, in my opinion, who a student would go through and get a doctor

630
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:40,360
pharmacy degree and not have any bachelor's degree. Well, can you imagine a medical physician

631
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,840
not having a bachelor's degree as far as I know as dentists do? I think all the lawyers now have

632
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:54,760
bachelor's degree before they get their doctor, jurors, prudence. And so we worked out essentially

633
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:03,160
seven year program, three year pre-farmacy. We made arrangements with general science that they

634
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:08,440
would accept courses in the first professional year, maybe some of the second towards the

635
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:14,120
general science degree. So if they don't have a bachelor's degree, they will by the end of their

636
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:20,280
second professional year and they have to before they take their last two years. Now it turns out

637
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:29,560
I believe over 90 percent are coming with bachelor's degrees now. But we were one of the first schools

638
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:38,040
to require this bachelor's degree requirement. I think Ohio State was coming to the other

639
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:45,640
always you, ironically, or coincidentally, or whatever I think is in it. I believe there was a

640
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,520
California San Francisco as always, but I should say we're one of the first. I think they always

641
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,760
they're one of the pioneers for the farm deep program and I think they always required a bachelor's degree.

642
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:03,240
I think they always did and that may have been true of USC also. My understanding is

643
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,760
a large number of the state farmers at schools, the well-established state universities

644
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,760
are now, I've got so much in their pre-farmacy that essentially there's a bachelor's degree requirement.

645
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,840
I don't know about specific, for example, if a person didn't walk in,

646
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,640
obviously, three and four years or year later, actually it had a year around curriculum three and a

647
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,520
half years, walk out with a farm due without a bachelor's degree. I don't know, frankly.

648
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,760
Well, it sounds like this shift of the farm be led to an even closer tie-out of USC, you know,

649
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,520
yes, you agree between the two universities. Because it requires a lot more clinical faculty,

650
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:53,400
it requires more clerkships, and more making more rounds than that. Yes, yes. There's no there's no

651
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:59,000
question about it. I want to talk a little bit more about your career. You mentioned your time

652
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,240
on a Oregon Board of Pharmacy. One of the interesting things that you were involved with,

653
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,760
there was assisting with the interpreting and implementation of the playing for a

654
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:17,560
assisted suicide law. Yes. That was a fascinating experience. Here was a situation.

655
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:27,320
You had the potentiality of a pharmacist who was opposed to it,

656
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:37,320
receiving a prescription, and not realizing why they were dispensing it. In fact, they

657
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,720
under the patient constant, they make a lot and give up a bunch of goofy advice, and may not even

658
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,160
realize what was happening, and then you had the situation under the hood. Well, wait a minute,

659
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:55,880
I'm not going to dispense this and pull it back. So, there were various scenarios. The sponsors

660
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,600
of the physician's system suicide may know if, and some buts about it, there was to be nothing

661
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:05,960
hidden from the pharmacist, nurses, anybody. It could be an open process, anybody who did not want

662
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:11,560
to participate, and they actually had networks of physicians and pharmacists, and there's so

663
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:18,840
forth, who were positive, and they could always put a family in touch, get them into the system.

664
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:27,160
So, we went back and forth with the board of medical examiners. No, no, scratch that.

665
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,160
We went back and forth with the Oregon Medical Association. It turned out that we've seen

666
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:39,720
that pretty well have the support of the physicians, including the officers, but there was a lobbyist

667
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:45,320
who has taken his cue from the American Medical Association, and if a physician doesn't want

668
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:55,160
to tell the pharmacist anything, that's it. God has spoken. And so, we finally wrote a rule

669
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:04,680
that said, physicians had to tell the pharmacists. Well, all of a sudden you had the order of

670
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,800
pharmacy, right, and they were all covering the pharmacists. The board of medical examiners were

671
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,200
not upset, because they couldn't get it. They were being shoved, not pushed, not to. And we now

672
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:23,240
had our rule, and the physician's Oregon Medical Association, their lobbyists, didn't like it at

673
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:33,880
all. So, of course, for this time I believe Dr. Kitsopper was governor, and so we, in the meantime,

674
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:41,640
we were trying to get through a clarity drug treatment through, which we had a train general says

675
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:49,080
we had the authority to do, but the drug industry didn't like it. And this is where pharmacists

676
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:55,400
can be involved in working out the treatment modalities and the doses so forth. So, we,

677
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:05,240
another board member and I were called into the governor's health advisor office. And

678
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:16,600
basically, what the governor did, he told the medical board, you take that board of pharmacy rule

679
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:23,000
and you rewrite it with your name on it, instead of their name, and you push it through.

680
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:30,440
Which they did, if that there was a draft and we, we approved it. That was fine. We didn't,

681
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:35,080
we didn't care. All we wanted was the pharmacists, and all that these prescriptions were coming through.

682
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:43,960
And so we told the health advisor, that's fine with us. And then he says, so what now,

683
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:49,560
is it you're trying to do, and we mentioned Clavion Drug Therapy, and this fellow had

684
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:55,080
was a former EMT or something on the ambulance. That's how he knew kids' hopper. They were

685
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:01,160
fishing buddies and so then Oregon. And he looked at his, well, is that like when I'm on the ambulance,

686
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:08,680
I can put start the IV and for a person in cardiac arrest and said, yes, he says, oh, okay,

687
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:15,640
you got it. I'll tell the law that it's from the OMA that you, it's going to go through. So,

688
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:21,160
we got what we wanted, and the physicians got, well, if you know, they got what they wanted, but

689
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:28,120
at least they had face saving on it. So, yeah, that's the story. We're all happy campers now.

690
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,440
We mentioned to you that you served on the foreign pharmacy graduate equivalence examination committee.

691
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,840
Yeah, that's the exam committee with the National Association Board's Affirmacy.

692
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:47,720
What did that entail? Oh, you had a significant number of graduates of foreign pharmacy schools

693
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:53,000
that wanted to immigrate to the United States in practice pharmacy. And we had, no, there is no

694
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
equivalent of a basic pharmaceutical, a basic medical exam, basic medical science exam. There's

695
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,520
something that medical schools have after a couple of years, I guess everybody takes this test

696
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,680
before they go out in the clinic. I'm not really, I'm really not quite sure how it works,

697
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:14,200
but there's, there apparently is some type of standard test. There's nothing like that with pharmacy.

698
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:20,440
So, this is the closest thing to it. If a, and there's other requirements for the graduate,

699
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,280
they've had to have so many years in a pharmacy school that has to meet certain curricular standards

700
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,040
and so on. And there is a test of spoken English by the way, they have to pass.

701
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,840
And of course, the test of English or the foreign language, they have to pass that also.

702
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:46,920
So, basically, there's a, there's a bank of questions that we work on. I have to be in the

703
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,640
medicinal chemistry area. That's supposed to be equivalent to what, if they can pass it,

704
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:59,480
then they have at least the minimum standards of graduating in the Dietactic Course Work

705
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:07,640
in a pharmacy school. Now, they still have to do their interning and that sort of thing.

706
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:15,880
So, I was in the medicinal chemistry. We meet twice a year. We would come up with questions

707
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,360
just like SATs and these questions that are on there that are going to count and there's

708
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:27,160
questions that are being tested to see if they're discriminating or they're too difficult or they're too

709
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:33,240
easy. And so we would be working on new questions plus trying to fix the questions that didn't

710
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:40,600
test right. And one of the things I did was, in the pine, as they developed this exam,

711
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:46,760
the chemistry portion, some of the chemical structures were pretty bad. They were bad. So, I

712
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:53,480
says, well, I've got a, I've got a chemical draw program, which was sort of the standard. And so,

713
01:23:53,480 --> 01:24:00,600
I worked out a deal with them. I didn't get paid, but I re-drew hundreds and hundreds of structures

714
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:09,320
using the same program. Something I'll see you worked on that is interesting to me and my

715
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:13,400
background with one is probably he developed them all for general anesthesia and I understand that

716
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:19,800
that's something you study to the controversy over general anesthesia. Well, that's one of the

717
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:28,920
contracts with the army. And we were trying to see if there was a receptor for it. I think

718
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:35,080
there is because they, they've got optically active, sterile chemical, such as the left and right

719
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:41,880
and the molecules. One is active, the other is not. So, there must be some type of receptor,

720
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,520
but that never led to anything. Do I understand correctly? There still is no accepted theory of

721
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,960
why, you know, anesthesia. I think there is some theories for it, but I'm not, there's some about

722
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,000
nerve conduction where it's going depolarization or I think there is some of that now,

723
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,960
because they can visualize the brain so much differently nowadays with the various types of scans,

724
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:10,120
the pet scanners and all that, but they can get some idea where which neurons are firing,

725
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:14,920
which part of the brain's are reacting in certain ways. So, I think, I think they're closer.

726
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:22,680
We retired in 2003 after 37 years in the College of Pharmacy. We saw a lot of change when we

727
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:30,360
could reflect on the changes in the College of the course of that time. Well, I mean, we've been talking

728
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:35,000
about them, but basically it started out to be a traditional batch of five-year batch of degree

729
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:41,640
program, but there's no chemistry, pharmaceutical analysis, formulation for basic pharmaceuticals,

730
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:49,480
what they call physical pharmacy, dosing, standard, classic pharmacology, and they were still

731
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:55,240
teaching pharmacy management if you're going to have your own drug store. So, I think there was

732
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:02,120
some accounting in there, and as it became more and more obvious that pharmacists were going to

733
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:10,920
be employees, you saw the management evolve into pharmacy socially economics, so you started,

734
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:18,280
they started to be the discussion of health care delivery, which population groups can get it,

735
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:24,680
and why, which ones cannot get it, and why not. Various types of insurance models out there,

736
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,320
then, as I said, the labs disappeared as far as the pharmaceutical sciences went,

737
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:41,000
there is still, I think they still do a little bit of compounding, some basic compounding,

738
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:49,320
but I think that's about it, and I'm not even sure, it's a small lab, and they got some sterile

739
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:56,840
hoods, and I think that's about all they're doing. I think I may be wrong on that too,

740
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:02,520
they'd have to ask somebody, like the associate dean or somebody to ask them.

741
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:10,680
Big emphasis on patient care, big emphasis on the clinical pharmacy aspect, which is

742
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,400
person has a certain disease, or a couple diseases, and this drug causes this side effect,

743
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:24,840
and this drug and our person shows up, and they're taking six or eight, I'm not exaggerating,

744
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:29,880
six or eight different drugs, and can I be whittled down to three or four, because they take a drug

745
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:34,680
to get a side effect, to get a drug to treat the side effect, and so on, gets messy.

746
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:43,320
Of course, with the area diabetes, just use as an example, not used to be basically insulin,

747
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:47,480
and a couple oral medications, well, there's several oral, and there's a whole bunch of other

748
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:52,920
drugs that have been discovered that affect the pancreas effect, the alpha cells for the

749
01:27:53,080 --> 01:28:02,360
beta cells, and now there's even looking at the auto-eminology aspect of it, all on the clinical side.

750
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:10,440
I know that one of the pursuits that you've followed retirement is your volunteer Medicare resource.

751
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,920
Yeah, in this day it's called Shiba Senior Health Benefit Assistance Program,

752
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,240
who's that notebook is sitting over there on your side you there.

753
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:25,160
Nationally, it's ship Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program with the A having been dropped.

754
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,840
Until very recently, we were part of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I'd have to

755
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,080
go to the computer and find out who the new federal agency is we're on. We are moving under,

756
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:40,920
I don't guess the move is not complete yet, and I'm not sure politically what the heck was going on,

757
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:52,120
and we got moved. But I started back in 2005 when the Part D drug programs began,

758
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:58,280
a person who was the coordinator was looking for volunteers desperately because they needed people to

759
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:04,920
put the drugs into the what was called Medicare.gov plan finder and find out what Part D plan would

760
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:11,400
work for them in every tire from pharmacy. So I've been bad at it ever since. I was Shiba

761
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:17,480
Light for a couple years and then full. I'm not, I think I've seen your one and been county. Now, I believe.

762
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:25,880
Anyway, we are, of course, go through training. We have to be re-certified every year.

763
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:31,240
We go through a background check which includes finger printing. Obviously, we have signed

764
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:40,680
all the confidentiality agreements. We log every contact to go into a obviously secure database

765
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:50,440
and our password changes every two months. I also, in one of the instructors, we call it new

766
01:29:50,440 --> 01:30:00,840
to Medicare or ABCD, some Medicare Part A, Part B, Part C, Part D. And that's a two hour free

767
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,680
course. Most of them are taught over here at the Benton Center because they're the parking and they're

768
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:17,480
the classroom with computer facilities. And I'm currently on phone duty now. Oh, I should explain.

769
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:23,640
If you have a Medicare question or you want to talk to a counselor, there's two ways of doing it.

770
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,480
One is to call the toll-free numbers sale on which you can get off of the web, put the board

771
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:34,680
and you can achieve it and then you can take it right there. And you punch in your zip code

772
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:40,680
and it automatically has referred them to Albany. Our sponsor here is RSVP, retired senior volunteer

773
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:48,520
program and the sponsors for the different Shiba slash ships. Very important, it's not no

774
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:54,040
a county. The Department of Health, I guess, is their sponsor. And I can't tell you who the sponsors

775
01:30:54,120 --> 01:31:01,800
are in other counties. It's little bit and Lincoln are together. But anyway, you'll go into the RSVP office

776
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:08,360
at the Council of Government's Office on Queens after you're over there in Albany. And then an email

777
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:15,880
to go out to the appropriate county with referral. And I'm on phone duty. And the main reason for that

778
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:22,040
is, is I can't verify. May I mention what you came in? My wife is on foster home and she's

779
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:28,680
actually under hospice. So I go up three times a day and feed her. Excuse me. And I can't get up to

780
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:35,080
the senior center. So I get the referrals and so forth. Which is a kind of interesting, I can actually

781
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:43,160
enjoy it almost better than, I don't mean anti-face to face, but you can, you can, you can get quite

782
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:50,680
a bit of information over the phone. Yeah. And we have, we have Google Calendar to make appointments,

783
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:56,600
I can even make an appointment form. It's just a seemingly complicated set of to be dealing with

784
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:02,840
one of the things we said mentioned in our classes and we'll tell clients when they almost are

785
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:12,200
feeling sheepish. When you, we worked and you had employer health insurance,

786
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,040
you took the employer plan. That was it. I mean, you might have had a choice to an

787
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:26,520
high deductible, but basically that was it folks. And they may or may not have had dependency coverage.

788
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:34,680
Okay, now you're reaching 65. What are you going to do? Are you going to keep working? Or is your

789
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:45,240
company your employer says fine? If then are you going to draw social security or not?

790
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,280
And a lot of people think, well, if I don't draw social security, I don't go into Medicare.

791
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:57,320
And no, wrong. At age 65, you have got to enroll in Medicare or you're going to get penalized.

792
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:04,600
And the penalties can be significant, by the way.

793
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:11,720
Unless you happen to be an employer group health plan of 20 or more employees.

794
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:21,160
At which case, you can delay it. So Medicare has been described as yes, no one with the following

795
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:31,640
exceptions. But it is universal health care single payer for the over 65 and over and for disabled.

796
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:40,760
It interfaces with private insurance to pick up deductibles and co-insurance.

797
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:47,960
And this is where a lot of people then should I go with a Medicare supplement? No, it's a

798
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:54,520
Medicare or should I go with an advantage plan? And if I decide to go with an advantage plan,

799
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,040
which one should I go with? If I decide to go with a Medicare, which one should I go with?

800
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:06,200
So there are these various. And then there's the fall open enrollment period where people can change plans.

801
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:11,480
And now with their fertile care act, the Medicare crowd also start making appointments,

802
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,800
because they see all this fall boost in a fertile care act. They want no houses affect them.

803
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,000
It doesn't. Well, it does, but there's nothing that can do about it.

804
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:25,240
Well, the effect is basically beneficial. They don't at whole slow and disappearing in the party.

805
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,720
So there's clearly a need for people like you to help people navigate.

806
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,040
Oh, it keeps us mentally alert, morally straight.

807
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,280
Well, let's just take a couple more questions for you, that the new building in Portland just opened up.

808
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:44,840
And I haven't seen it, but they say it's very nice that the other tower,

809
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:51,160
then it's beautiful view of the river. They could even watch a barge is being launched, you know,

810
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,840
but I, I had not seen the new one up other than drive by it.

811
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,280
So it strikes me as being another important chapter, I guess in the history of pharmacy.

812
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,800
I think they work very, they've been the current dean and the previous dean.

813
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:15,960
Work very hard to make sure we had the floor space and the labs and so forth to be a fully

814
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:25,560
not move us there, but to make sure that the faculty there had the resources in our to advance.

815
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:32,520
A number of more hired as clinical assistant, clinical associate professors, that's a non-tenure

816
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:39,720
track type of deal with a revolving, fixed term type of thing, but they're a tenure track faculty up there too.

817
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,200
The last thing I want to ask you about is that the university has changed so much in the last few years

818
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,600
and you've been used to change and grow and it's good to your perspective on where I always use heading right now.

819
01:35:51,160 --> 01:36:01,480
Well, I have the impression that we want to be the strongest university in the state, which I have no problem with.

820
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:08,440
We are, of course, in every county. I think our relationship with the state is quite good.

821
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:20,440
The amount of extramural funding that we bring in is phenomenal. It's not just NIH, I mean,

822
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:29,000
there's Ag, there's Sea Grant, all that type of thing. I think the question that OSU has to

823
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:40,520
really wrestle with as do any research university is making sure that the undergraduate still has a good

824
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:46,840
education experience, which at a good research university they can. You have good students and you can

825
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:54,280
get them involved in the search and out of new knowledge. It can be a fabulous, fabulous experience,

826
01:36:55,240 --> 01:37:04,200
but the faculty have to want to enjoy working with undergraduates, not just their graduate students and

827
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:12,520
their postdocs and for that young assistant professor, that can be a time telling, that can be a

828
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:17,080
strain because it's hard to get the funding. I mean, back in the days when the funding was more

829
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:21,480
plentiful, it probably wasn't, but I mean, they are struggling to bring that money in.

830
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:29,720
And they're hired now with fairly bent of generous startup packages and they return the

831
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:39,560
university wants them to produce. You might say, almost pay it back. So it's a rough go and I have to

832
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:50,040
be very candid and say, would I today start out the same way? I think pharmacy was fine.

833
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:58,200
And with the clinical pharmacy and so forth, I find that more interesting.

834
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:08,040
Many more instincts the wrong word, but I don't know if I would like to be on that constant gun

835
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:16,760
of getting funded and get it renewed. I still think that's my temperament.

836
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,600
I felt very fortunate that Dick O'Walk took me under his wing there and said, why did you?

837
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,440
I think he saw it was going to pull in big bucks. Why did you look at the regulatory?

838
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,320
And I think I was successful there.

839
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:37,320
Well, Dr. Mark, thank you very much. This has been very educational for me and I appreciate

840
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:42,600
you giving us this time to share your memories of pharmacy. Well, thank you for coming and

841
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,920
whatever I said, I'll be dying.
