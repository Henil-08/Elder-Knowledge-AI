1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
All right Ralph, if you would please introduce yourself

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,920
if your name and today's date in our location.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,500
Okay, Ralph Coleman, also Ralph Coleman, Jr., dates

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,700
July 8th, and we're in my long time,

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,100
residents in East Moreland neighborhood, Portland,

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,500
and when you're discussed, OEC and where you stayed,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
so on.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Yes, talk about your father and your association

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,100
with the University of Macquaras as well.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,200
So, let's start with your dad.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,300
Can you give us a little background on his upbringing?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Where he was born and where he was raised?

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,900
Okay, sure.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,500
He was born and raised in Canby,

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,600
which is a suburb of Portland, South,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,000
and basically a farming community.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,300
He had a small family, he had a younger brother,

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,100
a two-year younger brother.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
His father, P.L., or Philip Coleman,

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,700
had come west from Ohio and probably

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
before the turn of the century.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,100
And it was an educator and was super into the schools

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,700
there and can't be, that's where my dad grew up

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,300
when to can be high school and graduated.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,700
I think they're very first graduating class in 1914,

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,700
my during the state, then OEC.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,300
And it's not entirely clear what year has he was born?

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,700
Well, it's pretty clear it's 1896.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,900
There's an affidavit from his aunt, who raised him

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,100
and stayed in the birth day and so on.

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,700
But back in 1896, there were no birth certificates.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
So the record's either kept in a family Bible

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,100
or written down someplace.

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,500
But he turned up a 1900 census,

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,700
somehow it's having been born in 1895.

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,700
So he could use that if he wanted to be a year older.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,100
He used the 1895 date if he wanted to be a year younger

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,300
to reduce 1896.

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,900
And his mother died when he was about four or five years old.

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,300
And there were the family that my grandfather had married

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,500
into, sort of took the boys on and raised them.

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,100
This is primary, primary character,

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,500
who was his aunt, Ella, and Kathy.

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
OK, it sounds like athletics were important to him

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,300
from early age.

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Well, I would seem so that in that era,

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,300
they probably, I don't know if they played football or anything

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,300
like that, but yes, they had baseball team.

49
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,500
I have a picture in these archives,

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,300
a few in his uniform, and then with his team.

51
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,500
And played baseball for the mobile team.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
He's arm or shoulder or something.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,100
And it was not expected to ever play baseball.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah, so he made the decision to work in agricultural college

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
in 1914.

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Do you know why he made that decision?

57
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,100
I don't.

58
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,500
I think they were talked about it.

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
It's probably closer than the U of O.

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah, that decision to go to college, period.

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,500
The decision to go.

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't know if that's interesting.

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
His brother never went.

64
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,300
And his dad had been to college, but it wasn't a tradition.

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
The family, none of the, he's a standard family

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
in the can be area.

67
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,300
I don't think it ever made a college.

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
So I don't know what motivated me to do this,

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,700
just to smart, ambitious kid.

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
People liked him.

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
He took off.

72
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
He made it in dairy health injury.

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,700
Major in dairy health has been really good.

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,500
Well, he grew up in the farm community.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
And on the farm.

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
So this was a natural thing for him.

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,500
And there's pictures of him on campus.

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,900
He's had, judging a cow.

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,300
There's nothing like that, you know.

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,900
So he came out with a degree in dairy health injury in 1918.

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,500
And it was immediately drafted into the Army in World War I.

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,300
And went to Fort Lewis.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
Camp Lewis, the time for Lewis.

84
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Infantry, basic, you know, of the meat grinder route.

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,300
The war was climaxing in 1918.

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,300
And the big offensive were going on.

87
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,500
So he needed a lot of people.

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,500
And he was infantry, basic, applied for OCS.

89
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Officers, candidate school.

90
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,900
We sent him to that.

91
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,900
And that prolonged his stay.

92
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
Just long enough for the war to end before they left.

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,300
But he was commissioned to second Lieutenant and the machine got a battalion or something like that.

94
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,900
And Maddie's due avoid the war of the major part of it.

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Did he ever talk about his academic experience as a student?

96
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:08,700
Uh, hey, I don't remember any great, you know, long comments about that.

97
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
It was primarily an agricultural school.

98
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
He had a technical component to it.

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,900
The agriculture was the main thrust.

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
I don't know.

101
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,300
It's a good question.

102
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I don't know what it didn't hear that much about the coursework.

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
Well, we normally associate him with baseball.

104
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,700
But it sounds like he perhaps his greater talent was in tracking field.

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
That's true.

106
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
It was.

107
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,500
He would talk about this.

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
He went or he's the never-run at all when it ever competed in there.

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,900
I've been in a race and never did anything.

110
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,900
And somehow got acquainted with some people on the track team and the cross country team.

111
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,100
And he said, come on, run with us.

112
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
And he ran him into the ground, basically.

113
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,300
He just is a natural.

114
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,100
And so they said, OK, you're, come out track, you know.

115
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,500
He had developed into quite a respectable distance man.

116
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,900
His best time in the mile was in, is about 4 or 20.

117
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,500
And I think my son was looking up the world's record of the time was about 4, 15 or 14 or something like that.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,900
So this was a very respectable level of achievement.

119
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:35,900
And there would have been an Olympics in 1918 that he probably was, you know, tried for the American team and probably better pretty good shot at.

120
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,300
Of course, the war caused that to be canceled.

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,500
So that was the end of that.

122
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,700
But no track was his major athletic activity in Oregon State.

123
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,100
He was captain of the track team, competed in the long zone and all that sort of thing.

124
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,300
So yeah, that was his first athletic activity.

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,300
Did he ever express any regret that he couldn't have tried to be on the Olympic team?

126
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Well, maybe in passing.

127
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
But, you know, that's the way it goes.

128
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,300
We all have good or should have wouldn't have, you know.

129
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,900
We only played baseball for one year at Oregon 8 OEC.

130
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,100
Yes, I think that's correct.

131
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
He was playing.

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,900
He told me he was playing in a rural baseball.

133
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
You know, the varsity in the rural.

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
And I don't feel good.

135
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,100
You know, injured shoulder apparently had healed up in the intervening years.

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,700
And coach saw him play or heard about him said, you know, going out and take.

137
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,300
So he faced some games for them in a senior year and was pretty effective.

138
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't think they played more than 20 games, you know, a season.

139
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,700
And then later on, he, he was good enough to play professionally for three or four summers.

140
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,100
After he got out of college for the Portland Beers, which at the time was a triple A club.

141
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,300
And it, good success, good enough to be looked at by the majors.

142
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,700
And at that time, a team like Portland would own the players outright.

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,700
And the major leagues would buy the players from the teams they wanted.

144
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
If they wanted them, they would buy them from the team.

145
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,500
That's how the team made 20 of his selling to players in the major.

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,500
So he, had it was looked at by Detroit, I think.

147
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
They wouldn't have been in Oregon State.

148
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
He was on the staff by that time.

149
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
I think he turned away from that.

150
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
The more I secure position.

151
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
It was you then in professional baseball at the time.

152
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
The more secure position.

153
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
More secure position.

154
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Yeah.

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,300
The baseball in those days, you know, pay nothing.

156
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,500
Prears were short, you know, no pensions and nothing.

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,900
You just played for a while and then you were going on and that was it.

158
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,300
So he, you know, figured he was pretty well positioned where he was.

159
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,500
Stay on.

160
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,100
He got married.

161
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I think by that time, too.

162
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Tell me about the Ocelito Club.

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,900
Oh, I don't know very much about it.

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Just heard the name.

165
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,900
But I think that was a, the closest I can think it would

166
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
might have been kind of a, an eating club.

167
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,100
You know, they lived there.

168
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I don't know what they call them.

169
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Co-ops might have been a co-op.

170
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,500
And sort of a semi fraternity.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,700
And then that morphed him to the, uh,

172
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Gamma Talk beta.

173
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,900
Uh, well, I think he was still not a graduate when that came about.

174
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
And then the Gamma Talk beta, eventually of course,

175
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,100
became double UPSLON in the 1922.

176
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,900
And that was, uh, a big part of his, you know,

177
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,500
association with the rest of you.

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,700
Well, through through his living situation,

179
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,500
he encountered a couple, well, a few pretty extraordinary people

180
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,900
that he mentioned his best friends were spec key.

181
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,100
And that was okay.

182
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Well, they were close.

183
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,100
And, uh, spec was, uh, from Salem.

184
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,500
And, uh, was a good athlete to student body president.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,700
And they became good friends.

186
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,700
He was the best man at my entire wedding.

187
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,100
And they were, their family and our family were lifelong friends.

188
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
So a lot of each other and spec was always around.

189
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,500
And he became athletic directors.

190
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
You know what, uh, doing a state rate close ties.

191
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
In fact, his daughter lives in Kraval.

192
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,300
She'd be a good person to contact sometime.

193
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,500
If she'd be willing to, you know, provide the information for him.

194
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,700
Doug McCay, I think he might have been a little older than an idea.

195
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Maybe a year or so.

196
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,500
Of course, he would have become governor and secretary of the interior

197
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
and under eyes and honor.

198
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,900
So, uh, any other, um,

199
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,900
recollections of spec key in Doug McCay or stories about your father's association with them?

200
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,300
Well, uh, spec was just a marvelous person.

201
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,100
And, uh, load, fishing and hunting, and just all around.

202
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,300
Good administrator and a good guy.

203
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,100
And they did a lot of fishing and, uh, hunting together.

204
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Every summer, uh, for a number of years, we all go to Nesquen,

205
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,900
it doesn't look any different, you know, today,

206
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
and I did that for a couple of weeks.

207
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,900
And we, you know, either ten families from the Oregon State

208
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
didn't from Salem in various places.

209
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
And that was just, uh, summer holiday.

210
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
That was Nesquen.

211
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Somehow, as we stayed in, uh, in the mid 30s,

212
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,900
we're still there looking just exactly like we did back then.

213
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,900
So, there's a lot of interaction, you know, a lot of closeness.

214
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
And, uh, in, in the time.

215
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Maybe people still do that, I don't know.

216
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,900
How did, uh, how did Ralph meet his wife?

217
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I don't know.

218
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
She was a student at Oregon State, uh, a tri-delt.

219
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Uh, she'd grown up in Colberg, went to the University of Oregon for a while.

220
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Uh, and then transferred to Oregon State, I'm not sure why.

221
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,900
She was about three years younger than I did.

222
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,900
And, uh, I was very, come with young woman.

223
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,900
So there were some pictures of her after a while.

224
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
As well.

225
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,900
And, um, so, you know, these, I don't know the details.

226
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
They dated and got married in there.

227
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
In her parents' house in Eugene.

228
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
I think it was.

229
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Later on, they lived very,

230
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
firstly lived with us.

231
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
We grew up with a lot of part of their lives.

232
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,900
And, uh, very nice, extended family situation.

233
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Did he talk any more about other social activities or more about fraternity life,

234
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
in his school years?

235
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Well, he'd tell the usual, hazing stories and things like that.

236
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,900
He didn't sound all that much different from my own experience.

237
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Yeah, four years later.

238
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Uh, but, uh, it was, I think Oregon State was a fun place.

239
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
I don't think they took life all that seriously.

240
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Yeah.

241
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
But we see in those years that it was an egg school primarily,

242
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
with a big military component.

243
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Uh, engineering was certainly in the picture.

244
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,900
But I think it was just mostly, uh, uh, local people.

245
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Local kids went there.

246
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Hmm.

247
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Did he mention his ROTC experience?

248
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Yeah, he thought that was great.

249
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
He loved ROTC.

250
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Uh, he was good at it.

251
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Yeah, a lot of kind of a command presence.

252
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,900
And, uh, just resonated with his mentality, I guess.

253
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,900
And, uh, the ROTC, I think, was what got him, uh, in the OCS.

254
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,900
You know, you may have saved his funds.

255
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
They're at, uh, at Fort Lewis.

256
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Camp Lewis.

257
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Well, I mentioned that the world or one experience kind of came in one of that.

258
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
In 1919, he returned to Corvallus.

259
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
All right.

260
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Get out of the military and that fall.

261
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
I see more end in November.

262
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I think he got out probably in, uh,

263
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
80, uh, later on in the year.

264
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Anyway, he went to, uh, move back to Corvallus.

265
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
And it was hired by the Corvallus schools.

266
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
And they're intramural.

267
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,900
They're, uh, their PE athletic aspect of it,

268
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
coaching and things like that.

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
And, you know, with no background, whatever, and education.

270
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
And I think he did that for a year.

271
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Then was, uh, hired.

272
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Put on the staff and all your state within, uh, physical education department.

273
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
And they kind of tasked with, uh, developing digital programs.

274
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
And, uh, expanding that into the, uh, the, uh,

275
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,900
those facilities, activities available.

276
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
He did that pretty much the rest of his career.

277
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,900
He was head of freshman men zero,

278
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
head of men's physical education.

279
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
So he,

280
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,900
was in the PE department like in 1919 and was there until 1961.

281
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
So you found a home.

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Yeah, and realize it pretty extensive these days.

283
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,300
Well, together with, you know,

284
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,900
and a very extensive of those new these days.

285
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
And apparently we have a rough goal.

286
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
And to thank for one.

287
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Well, he got them started.

288
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
He didn't, uh, finish it.

289
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,400
But there was what he, that was his original.

290
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:23,320
In fact, there's a little side for you, you know, where the tennis courts are and it would be

291
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,760
west of, it would be just north of the football facilities on that was the original Coleman

292
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:39,240
field. Really? Yeah. It was the inner mural field. I don't know, I don't know, it was

293
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,080
ever formally, you know, just called that. And then when the coaching and then he was there

294
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:52,280
forever, then that became Coleman field. No, interesting little side there that's kind of fun.

295
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:01,320
He lived at the Gauntel Beta House during this time. Yes, and I know little about that.

296
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:11,240
But like I said during the while, he was when he came back after the war, and he re-associated

297
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:19,560
with the fraternity. In fact, with there. And he didn't, wasn't a college or anything, but he just

298
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:29,880
moved in. And that's when they signed him this promising, but kind of socially awkward

299
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,840
freshman, minus calling. And my dad wasn't at school, but he was, you know, supposed to look

300
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,360
out for a minus and socializing and, you know, getting going at school. And that's when he reported

301
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,360
the House that he didn't take this guy, he's going to make it every state, never studies.

302
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,560
All he does is reap pole blisters and sleeps a lot. So he totally missed the mark on that one.

303
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Minus was so easy for calling that he didn't have to exert himself at all. And as you know,

304
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,360
he was coaching or teaching undergraduate chemistry, I think, by the time he was a sophomore junior.

305
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,760
So he, and was a good guy, I guess, you know, a popular guy, and one of the guys, and, you know,

306
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,960
think of two-time Nobel Prize winners as one of the guys. Normally, I think he always, I think he always

307
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,760
cherished that relationship, you know, because he was shy and sort of, you know, a misfit,

308
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,880
when you're that smart and that, you know, that level of achievement, I think it's, you do,

309
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,720
I think find yourself kind of on the outside. So to whatever extent, it's true, I think the

310
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,760
Gamotaur Beta is socialized him. And, uh, would you like to meet Spam on that a little bit?

311
00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. I met Linus a few times, and we weren't close friends or anything like that.

312
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,440
But he never forgot to read the state. And, uh, in the Gamotaur Beta,

313
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:16,200
he just became Delta Upslawn in 1922 national fraternity. And Linus Paulang and my dad and a number

314
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,720
of other people were chartered members. And there's pictures somewhere in the soil of his group, you know.

315
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:33,640
And, uh, his, uh, in 1966, it would have been the, you know, that was a 40 year,

316
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,080
60, yeah, I was later in that. Well, it's in my documentation or somewhere. They had a, uh,

317
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,800
a reunion or a, uh, anniversary. It might be in the 50th, maybe in the 60th, I don't know, uh,

318
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,640
anniversary with the founding of the fraternity. And, uh, you know, all the alums and the

319
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,320
Borland area and so on were there. And the roundup was many of the charter members, as they could find.

320
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,920
And there were about either 10 of them, something like that. And Linus is one and my dad was one.

321
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,840
And each one of them took their turn into my kind of told stories, you know, about their experiences

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,520
that, uh, that are in your state. And, um, minus this was particularly funny because, uh,

323
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,800
when, uh, when they were applying to the national fraternity, they had the list, the achievements and,

324
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:33,800
uh, attributes and, uh, uh, of all the potential members. And, uh, they wanted to have, you know,

325
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,200
some athletic experiences for everybody, you know, and he played this. He did that. Linus had no

326
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,840
athlete, you know, background, whatever. So my dad was assigned the chore of teaching him to, uh,

327
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,600
lung herders. So they did claim he was a track man. And Linus described, you know, and there's

328
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,120
a very funny way is he and my dad bounding around the track, you know, uh, drill us, jumping over

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,360
herders. So he could claim to be a herdler. So he had a Linus that a good sense of humor.

330
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,240
And he told some interesting stories. He told about, uh, he talked for about 45 minutes,

331
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,160
just unscripted. And I just, I'd give anything you had, uh, a recording of that because he talked

332
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:30,440
about his, uh, his experiences with, uh, uh, passports and pieces. And he was on his way to, uh,

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:42,040
uh, uh, Stockholm to get one of his Nobel Prizes. And they landed in Oslo and nobody met him.

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Nobody from the embassy came to greet the point or anything. Uh, he was, you know,

335
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:57,640
not in good reputed the time. And so he went on to Stockholm on his own. And, uh, then he, uh,

336
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,160
he was also given the, uh, what was the prize he got from, uh, the award he got from Russia,

337
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,280
the Linus piece price, the Linus piece price. Okay. And so he had been awarded the Linus piece

338
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:19,080
price. And was, you know, requested to go to Russia. And we see even he couldn't get a piece of it.

339
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,960
And he just couldn't get permission from Russia to enter Russia. Here he is going to get the

340
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,880
piece price. They wouldn't let him in the country. So he contacted one of his science colleagues

341
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,040
in Russia and said, you know, what's going on here? Welcome, I can't come. They won't let me come.

342
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,960
So the guy said, I'll look into it and he got back and he said, well, they got two Linus

343
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,000
Pauling files. You know, one is Linus Pauling, you know, piece loving advocate, uh, the world piece.

344
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,600
And so on the other is Linus Pauling, capitalist running dog. And this, when, somehow, the application

345
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,520
got in the comments and cameras running dog file. So they wouldn't grant it. They got a straight

346
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,840
down. But I thought that was, you know, it's kind of a typical cold war snap. There were,

347
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,400
they weren't on the same page anymore. The rest of us were. So anyway, he got there and got the

348
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,360
Linus prize. And of course, this was a controversial event. You know, what's, when was that?

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:24,040
60s. Yeah, 60s, oh, 70s, many. Yeah, cold war. And that didn't go down well. And because he was

350
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,920
being criticized for, you know, his nuclear test ban proposals and atmospheric testing so on. So he was,

351
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,560
he was controversial enough that it was. And I was student at the U of O was a graduate student

352
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,240
later. He came through on some kind of a speaking thing. And it was controversial. So the man was

353
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:54,280
the 60s, the 50s, the 50s. And, in fact, he was a little aside story that's kind of interesting,

354
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:02,120
you know, in our life of Trinity, there was a picture of Linus hanging in the Dan. And, you know,

355
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:11,160
other dignitaries. And this would have been in the early 50s. And his picture was taken down by some

356
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,840
of the members and hidden away somewhere. It's disappeared because of this, you know, the attack from

357
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,960
the right. Yeah, I don't think it faced Linus at all. I think he just plowed on through, you know,

358
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:31,720
I don't know. So he, you know, he knew we wanted to do. He did his, you know, everlasting credit.

359
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,800
And he and your dad maintained a connection over the years. But he and your dad maintained a connection.

360
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Not a loose, loose connection. I don't think it was ever, you know, there was a history there early days,

361
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,800
which, you know, you don't, you remember those things. But I don't think there was much, you know,

362
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,640
correspondence or much contact. There's he was, you know, operating an entirely different,

363
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,160
different level. Yeah. Well, back to your dad in the early days in Corvallus,

364
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,880
he coached freshman tractor four years, too. I think that's right. I don't have all of that,

365
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,080
some of those information I gave you. I think that was probably his first coaching job was,

366
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,120
was track. Did he maintain an interest in track over the years? Yes, he did. Yeah, he, uh,

367
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,960
he rode your e-load, helping with track leads and helping put them on high school track leads.

368
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,720
So he was, yeah, that was his really first athletic, well, I think. He's also, uh,

369
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,840
outstanding golfer. Yeah. We became the head baseball coach there in the 1920s,

370
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,720
but it was a different situation back then than it is now. How do you mean? Well, he's essentially

371
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,760
a volunteer job for one. Oh, right, right, right. I'm not sure it was a big job. I think he often

372
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,440
all often said that it was not, he was paid, you know, to be an administrator, teacher,

373
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,800
and the physical education department, and academic appointment there. So baseball was just sort of

374
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:03,400
an aside. It wasn't a very, uh, I don't think, high powered program. There's photos in this thing,

375
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,680
is show the baseball field in 1920. There isn't even a backstop. You know, world of all is there

376
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:17,080
in the CDA building and the heating plant with a big chimney in all that, but nothing else is around

377
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:25,160
there. So it was very, you know, low-key operation. And, uh, he, uh, he didn't want to be paid

378
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,560
for it, largely because he said that, uh, didn't there be an expectation? You know,

379
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,640
didn't want that. He wanted to be able to do this as a, as a, as a hobby, you know, as a fun

380
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,280
thing. And it was, and, uh, cutting a lot of notoriety, you know, made a lot of friends,

381
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,040
the lot of fun for him. But he didn't want the, they eventually didn't start paying him, you know,

382
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,800
years later, but it was not a big amount of money. That wasn't his job, that wasn't how he made

383
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,440
it. And I, I was not that kind of shrewd, you know, coaches get fired because they don't perform.

384
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,480
And, uh, he didn't want that, you know, get, find somebody, if you get somebody, if the price

385
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,640
you're getting me for, go for it. But he didn't coach not to stop from 1922 on, he ever has several

386
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,480
periods there. When he was had other administrative, uh, do these in the 30s slash field coach,

387
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,080
I think, for about six years. Yeah, that was fascinating. It just got very,

388
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,880
slidescale, also baseball. Yeah. Yeah. But it was a very low key sport, uh, like I said, 20 games,

389
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,760
maybe it's under, because they were lucky. And they just play local teams. Was there any

390
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,720
recruiting at all? Or I don't know. Or my dad recruited even recruit local and scout around high

391
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,760
school kids in the summer. So nothing like, nothing like today's light years. You know,

392
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,400
you know, there are any scholarships to offer back there. Uh, I think, by the time I got there in the

393
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,240
50s, I think there were some, there were some scholarships. They'd have a handful,

394
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,480
let's split it up in a little piece, as most I think there, you had to work for them in those days.

395
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,320
If you were getting a stipend ride, they called it years, you had to put in a certain amount of hours,

396
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,600
you know, cutting grass or doing something. And, you know, they made us the, we had to do that.

397
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Well, tell me about how his, his coaching career evolved over time. I mean, baseball became

398
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,680
more formal and he became more established and the program became more established. Well,

399
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,600
it was just an evolution. I don't know if they, uh, they were long time rivalries or some great

400
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,120
pictures of one of those pictures in their book Bailey kicking the bucket, you know, in the water

401
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,520
spring out. And so they were around Oregon. They were, you know, lots of good rivalries there.

402
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:52,200
And, uh, people like the game, uh, but it just developed and got, you know, they're making

403
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,960
the, they were the division was there. And then eventually in the 50s, late 40s, they formed a,

404
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,000
it was the Southern division, the California schools, right, they were, we didn't play them.

405
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,120
And then in that year, they started to play postseason games. And the college were real

406
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:16,680
series came along by 1946 to 1947, something like that. Stores W Bush was captain of the first

407
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:24,200
Harvard team. I think they won the college world series. He was the first baseball, George H.

408
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,760
W Bush, first Bush. He's W, yeah, not W, he's W. So, uh, college baseball got a big shot in the

409
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:40,200
arm when that national competition started. And, um, they did have good years in bed.

410
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,160
Like, uh, it was a, a lot of fun. At any point, did he feel like that he was baseball coach

411
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,280
was his job and, and the other job was less of his job or, you know, I don't think so. He always

412
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,600
pay attention to where you're, who signs the check. And, uh, but baseball was what, uh, you know,

413
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,240
got it as reputation and then as a social thing. And, uh, you know, his players loved him. And,

414
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:17,000
everybody knew who he was. And, uh, he's very personal guy. And, that people responded to him

415
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,040
and liked him. And, uh, so that makes life easy. Yeah. It's only more about his personality. You see,

416
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,400
he was an intense competitor. He said, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. He just, on the bench, he was just

417
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,960
a constant motion, you know, throwing grass in the air and stouting up and down and attacking the

418
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,640
unplayers and challenging calls. You don't see that anymore at all. You know, but all the coaches used

419
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:49,880
to do it. In fact, you know, in the 40s and 50s and 60s. And, uh, uh, but after the game was over,

420
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,240
it'll probably use, you know, everything was fine. But, I think, I think that was, uh, I thought

421
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,120
that was kind of a mega, even your coaches just constantly, you know, spinning out of control,

422
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,080
practically, and your sports remain calm. And, you know, we need to control. But, uh, you know,

423
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,480
his, his intensity was infectious. No question about it. You know, you want to win too.

424
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,760
Well, uh, obviously, Coral's is in a rainy place and, and baseball is played during the

425
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,720
spring when it's often raining. But, did you never, did you have a facilities component to

426
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,440
his job, too? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm still taking care of the field, you know, obviously.

427
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,840
Well, that's, yeah, the players did most of that, because they were on a scholarship arrived,

428
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,640
and then we did a lot of that. So you can imagine what kind of shape that baseball feels in.

429
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,080
We used the armory for our spring, you know, workouts and things. And the season didn't start.

430
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:52,280
We didn't play any games until the start of spring quarter. Now, it's, you know, they played

431
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,920
what, 60 or 70 games a year now. Yeah. And we were lucky if we played 25 or 30. And that was

432
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,720
fine with me. It's good to get the season over. Go on and do other things. Well, let's travel

433
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:17,000
like back then. No buses, cars. We took my senior year, I guess, the ones we took our first

434
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:29,080
out of state trip, spring break. There's a week in there. And so my dad is scheduled as several

435
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:37,080
games in California. So we piled in these cars and took off. California played Stanford,

436
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:45,320
Cal, Sacramento, Fresno, and you know, and we didn't have any budget at all. This was the first

437
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,160
out of state trip, you know, the set for the conference play. The first, you know, they do this routinely.

438
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:57,320
Now they go all over the country, you know, playing in tournaments. And this was interesting experience.

439
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:05,080
I think it would have been 1953 probably. And we'd pull into some town like, uh, a whole

440
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:15,880
Berkeley, we're going to play Cal. And my dad is, say, okay, the game, we have the field tomorrow at noon,

441
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,560
games at two thirty or something. Be there noon, see you. We're, we're on our own.

442
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,720
We didn't have a hotel. We didn't have anything. We, I think we had some meal money. I think

443
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,920
you might have given us some meal money. But, um, and we were supposed to fan for ourselves. We did

444
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,720
by staying at fraternities. You know, you know, I phone and call it the U House and say, you know,

445
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,640
I'm down here with the, or you state baseball team, and we come in camp there for a couple of days.

446
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, sure. And also with the guys that weren't in fraternities, we just bring them along, you know,

447
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,120
pretend like they were. So that's how we got by in Fresno, we finally stayed in the hotel

448
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:05,720
because I think he wanted to know where everybody was when they came time to go home. But other

449
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,200
than that, we were just, uh, just freelancing it. Yeah. That's when I prepared that the day that

450
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,360
everything, but they're private jet, you know. How did the, how did the colon feel itself? It wasn't

451
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,120
call coming to fill them and how did that happen to change over time? Well, I think you just got

452
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:29,800
just to fill into the usage, you know, uh, uh, before it was dedicated, you know, formally dedicated.

453
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:38,040
Yeah. Uh, just, did he have to raise some funds? Do you do recall to have an

454
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:43,560
group in Spain? Or, I don't recall anything like that. I think it was just, uh, based on what the,

455
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:49,240
what the athletic department would provide. Actually, they put a back step up. They put a back

456
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,720
step up. We had seats, bleachers, and all that kind of thing. But it was, uh, it was pretty primitive.

457
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,960
There were no fans out in the outfield. Oh, really? No. And, uh, and the ground was hard.

458
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,200
And, uh, while we got past the outfielders, it was all run. But you couldn't hit one out of the park.

459
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,840
They were all inside the park. Yeah. So that was a, made an interesting, you know,

460
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:22,200
addition to the, to the chaplain. So you wanted fast outfielders. You mentioned that training was

461
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,040
pretty casual. Yeah. Yeah. They're what really wasn't any. You know, we'd start to we'd work out

462
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,160
of the job or the armory and I'd have stressed running because that was especially for pictures

463
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,160
because that was, you know, good for you. But, uh, no, you know, half the team probably spoke to

464
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,880
including my dad. And, uh, that was just, you know, we'd take smoke breaks during the game, under the

465
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:50,280
stands. The buses, things like that. So a little more casual. Yeah. And this is both teams with

466
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,240
a joint for the smoke break. Right. Well, yeah. Yes. I couldn't, I hadn't thought of that. But, uh,

467
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,360
we were on the first base side in those days. Now they're on the third base side. And, uh,

468
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:06,600
down above Southam, in the field, they wouldn't put ball stadium stands and went around there.

469
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,400
I don't know if you fell for it. Yeah. Yeah. They'll feel nervous. We could down under there.

470
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,640
I understand some, you know, be out of it. Yeah. So it was a, was this, was a schedule before the game

471
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,880
or was there some signal when up there? It was time for a smoke break. I thought about what was just,

472
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:29,880
let's go. In between yet, you know. Well, his most successful team was probably

473
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,720
1952, the team that won the PCC championship and said he wasn't regional, much of the calls for

474
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,760
old series in Omaha. You were, you were a member of the squad anyway. Right. I was a member of

475
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,680
the squad. It was actually Jay, I was JV, and then you didn't play, uh, you know, a play against

476
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,840
the varsity and with them and practice, in practice or something like that. But, no, I didn't,

477
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:58,360
I didn't actually, uh, play with the team. And the numbers, they took back to Omaha. I think they were

478
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,720
restricted. So again, it was a fairly small squad. There were players that played, you know,

479
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:12,360
the longest part of the season that didn't, uh, didn't go back. They got hammered. They lost

480
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:19,080
the first two games. It was hot. They got there. That wasn't anything. They didn't make it back

481
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,360
for another, well, at 30 years or 35 years or something like that. Well, do you remember much about

482
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,160
that that season? I mean, it sounds like it was sort of a magical season. Well, things came

483
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:38,040
together and it's a really good athlete. Uh, those days, uh, it was, uh, very common for,

484
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:49,480
if you guys to play more than one sport. And, uh, let me see, uh, catcher was a, uh, starting

485
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,560
in and put won't in. First basement was a starting forward. Second basement was a starting

486
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,440
guard, the basketball team. Third basement was a linebacker, football linebacker. Left fielder

487
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,840
was another tight end. And so I think out of, if you took away the pitches, I think there were three

488
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:16,280
starters on that team that didn't start for some other team. So without those guys, we would

489
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,480
help us, you know. So yeah, you could play, and they loved it. They loved baseball because I

490
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,880
got them out of spring football and that sort of thing. So they all wanted to play baseball.

491
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,440
It was a fun sport. What do you remember hearing about the, uh, that Omaha trip? Obviously didn't

492
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,880
go all in the field, but it was, well, I think they went by train long training the very hot

493
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,600
while they were there, Omaha, you know, in that time of year, it'd be pretty, uh, pretty bad,

494
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,080
and I don't think there are accommodations were very good. I think it was only about the,

495
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,200
if you've fifth or sixth year of the College World Series, so I don't think they really got in there

496
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,480
rhythm down yet. And, uh, they, I remember them talking about the heat they couldn't sleep,

497
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,000
and we had these heavy wool uniforms, just one uniform. You know, you want something warm,

498
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,320
you played out here, but back there, it just totally, you know, inappropriate. I think that hurt them.

499
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,440
You remember it being a big deal that made the World Series on campus? Oh, yeah. Yeah, we played, uh,

500
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,560
we played USC, uh, Southern Cal, we were the perennial champions, and we played them in,

501
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,120
in played them in Kerala. So we played them in Los Angeles the year before they beat us down there.

502
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:37,320
We got them again in Kerala, so 52. And I think we had 5,000 people there. They would

503
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,680
stand up, you know, dragged them in from all over, you know, huge crowd. He was a big deal.

504
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,440
Yeah, that must have been something else. Yeah, it was. It was a great fight.

505
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,920
A couple of, no more early players that I came across, maybe you can comment on, do you know

506
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:03,160
what you know, Wes Schomerick? Yeah, I knew Wes, um, he was, uh, lived over in the coast.

507
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,640
I think, uh, over on the Nesthucca, and it was a fishing guide and an outdoor type of guy.

508
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:18,680
And he'd come to all the games, big, early, you know, moisture, you know, guy. And, uh,

509
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,280
it was also a great football player. I don't know if he played in the pros or not, but he was,

510
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,080
he did play pro-based, but he's played major league baseball for the Phillies.

511
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:36,520
And the other day, I came across as Ed Coleman. It was the right, yeah, his half brother.

512
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,920
He was several years younger and played for me when you stayed. And really good career in the

513
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,160
majors, he played, uh, five or six years. And, uh, they played for the board of the beavers after that.

514
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,040
He was, uh, he had a good career. He's in, uh, he was in the record books for a while. He was a

515
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,120
great-pinch hitter, Helmut, American League, Pinch hit, season, single season, Pinch hit record

516
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,960
for about 30 years or something. So, he had a good success.

517
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,760
Affleck family. Yeah. Yeah.

518
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,720
Did you not have a particular style as a coach and any sort of philosophy of baseball? I mean,

519
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,880
we at KC is famous for a small ball approach. Was there anything like that?

520
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:27,400
Uh, just beat the other guys up, you know, that 52 team wasn't good. He was the guy for huge,

521
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,720
you know, the starting four were just six five and the football players were six three, six four

522
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,200
for the day and these guys were huge. It's a big picture, isn't everything, physically.

523
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,240
And we would make sure that when we take batting practice before a game, that was always

524
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,400
pretty game rituals, these team would take batting practice, you'd watch the other team.

525
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,720
You know, yeah. And we make sure that the bigger the guys were the earlier they got out.

526
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,640
And yeah, so we brought these great big guys out. And they'd be in the ball all over the place.

527
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,680
And it was intimidating, you know. So yeah, he liked that kind of team.

528
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,600
So he didn't, we didn't play much small ball. I think the idea was just to, you know,

529
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,240
overpower. Yeah, who were some of your dad's best friends in Correlas?

530
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,520
Well, he was there for a very long time, as you said, he's a popular guy.

531
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,840
The early dawn, all the clubs, the young's club, and the older he's well,

532
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,080
and you know, there was a club he joined it. And most of the close friends we had,

533
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,120
there were a lot of them at the department, the lanterns,

534
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,840
the Dixon's, other coaches, the last deal, you know, we just,

535
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:57,080
lie, stinder the role of close friends, the coaches. And he had close friends just among the

536
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:05,000
townspeople. He was a small townboy, and liked small town associations.

537
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,640
What was your impression of Slatskyl?

538
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,240
Terrific guy. I liked Slatskyl. I used to caddy for him, and he'd always give me two bucks.

539
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,800
I think that was, so, and he had trick kids who were a little younger than me, but,

540
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,920
of course, I knew them and everything. Slatskyl was a really good guy. He just, you know,

541
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,800
found his niche and stayed in a, just, you know, a good grade. They'd be on, they'd be, you know,

542
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,200
standard participants in the annual beach trips, and the parties, and how they're fishing,

543
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,120
and they, they did all this stuff, you know, all the coaches, and people did all these things together.

544
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,200
No, Slatskyl was a, you know, really, really a good guy.

545
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,400
Trying to think there was something I was going to say about him like him or what it was.

546
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:08,200
Oh, maybe a little anecdote you may not know. UCLA was looking for a basketball coach,

547
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:16,120
and the ended up hiring John Wood, but Slatskyl could down. It's teams of beaten them,

548
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,080
UCLA, two years in a row, and the championship. So, he'd be decided to encounter us,

549
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,200
I don't think they could offer him any kind of money, but he used to decided to stay on,

550
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:34,200
he grew up in Salem, so he was a young, very much a local, local way. So, Wood and Wood,

551
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:42,840
on to become, you know, a legend. And Slats preferred the smaller arena.

552
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,880
How about long-standing, you know, they know? Oh, yeah. Yeah,

553
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,560
a lot of he was just a really nice guy. He was lots of fun, and then we'd go hunting and fishing, you know,

554
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,400
my dad, and he just, he liked, you know, when you're a kid, you know, when there's people

555
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,240
growing up, so like you, and others, they're just kind of going to the motions, you know?

556
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,040
And a lot of you really like to like to people like kids. This is the terrific guy.

557
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,840
Well, it sounds like outdoors, we're important to this group of men.

558
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,840
Were there other hangouts that they frequented, besides the lodges?

559
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,680
Well, Elf's Club, primarily that was the place where everybody gathered.

560
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,800
It was right in the center of town at the time.

561
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,200
They know if the building is still there, but it was right, you know, on third street or fourth street,

562
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,480
and then, so this was just the focus for all, you know, social activities in town,

563
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,760
get moose and others, but the Elf's Club was the one that most people, you know, frequented.

564
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,880
My sense of the athletic department doing your dad's time is of a pretty tight net group

565
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,640
because that accurate, you think? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Paul the Monday,

566
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:01,080
course he came in in late 30s, played basketball, and the Navy, and then came back and never left.

567
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:08,520
He still went right back, isn't he? He was the JD baseball coach, was he not?

568
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,880
He was, he was the freshman, he was the only assistant. My dad had, and I don't think he got paid,

569
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,560
but he was the tennis coach, assistant basketball coach, and assistant baseball coach.

570
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:28,120
So he was your coach as a Navy. Right. Well, as he liked, as a coach, who could guy, you know,

571
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,200
baseball hadn't been his game, but the matter, you know, he can manage it.

572
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,160
Never replayed a game against the, uh, as a freshman, they had freshman teams in those days.

573
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,120
He had only played three years of varsity, so he played your first year as a freshman.

574
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:52,360
And we let overplayed the penitentiary. You know, in Salem, they played a whole thing.

575
00:45:52,360 --> 00:46:00,440
The saying was that they played a strictly home schedule. So we were in there, and it was fun.

576
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,440
You know, the Lettison, I'd never been the penitentiary, and, you know, the field was out in the corner,

577
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:11,240
was huge wall. And the umpire was, uh, I was pitching the game, actually. And the umpire was,

578
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,840
you know, the convict, and so on. And they were just on each other, totally, they bothered us, you know,

579
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:25,560
but they were just raising each other, everybody had a nickname. And so it was a, it was a fun experience.

580
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,240
I don't know what the baseball, but I don't know if the prison grays, I don't know if they still have a baseball team or not.

581
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,720
We did have was also an official, you've fished it football and basketball. Yes.

582
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:47,560
Yeah, and that was his, there was a hobby. I mean, he made money at it. And uh, yeah, a quite a good reputation.

583
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:58,440
He was a football official with several rose balls. And yes, that's where he finally got out of that

584
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,960
the late 30s. He was two more, two physically demanding, you know, football and the basketball.

585
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,400
No, he did a lot of many was, uh, kind of commissioner for referees, for a while, for the conference.

586
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,880
You would evaluate officials and read them and, you know, with some thanks over year.

587
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,880
Well, he retired in 1966, and he mentioned he was a good golfer at,

588
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,640
he seems to have turned his attention to golf, though. Well, he always played golf.

589
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,880
I'll take that back. He's, I don't know, when he started playing golf, but he helped lay out

590
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,880
the Dallas Country Club. Really. And it was really good and coached to your taught golf.

591
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,080
He never coached golf. He taught golf for years in a physical education department or in state.

592
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:52,280
And uh, played a lot and was good. Anything like that came easy to it, you know, when you're

593
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,280
athletic, it tends to generalize, you know, all areas. And uh, do you play golf?

594
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,680
A little bit. Do you know what a shank is? Yeah. Well, he developed the shanks,

595
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,680
a terminal occasion of the shanks. And uh, he, uh, didn't play for about 15 years.

596
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,320
Just walked away from the game totally. He was a regular golfer, you know, a couple times a week,

597
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,720
kind of thing. And took the lessons and tried everything. And uh, this couldn't get over it.

598
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,360
And then when you retired, he kind of got back in the golf a little bit. When you retired,

599
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:32,440
they left Corvalis, my mother, and sold their house and moved to Woodburn, the singer states.

600
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,080
And he was hired there as the golf to take a little golf program. So yeah, that was his retirement

601
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,320
venue. Yeah, golf was important to him. He liked that game.

602
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,720
Again, he was so competitive that it kind of, you know, you can't be overly going to be.

603
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,440
You can't try too hard, you know, and go off as a game. You have to play below your,

604
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:05,080
you know, your maximum effort. Yeah. And so I think that that was, uh, kind of, uh, made it harder.

605
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,920
Do you know anything more about the, the laying out of the country club? I mean, just didn't

606
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,520
that story. Uh, only that, uh, they planted the all those, uh, they planted fur trees.

607
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,960
They out the course. I remember it was with the members and the volunteer, the volunteer,

608
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:31,000
and they planted all those fur trees in the rough. And it was only nine holes, you know,

609
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,640
begin with, and very yellowy and clay, and it's just like concrete, you know, to play it. So,

610
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:46,440
we know that was laid out in, uh, during mid-20s. So, he was a charter member then. I think probably

611
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:57,400
what it's, yeah, probably pretty close. Um, well, Colin Field was dedicated as such in April 1981.

612
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,920
I'm sure that meant something to him. Do you have memories of that particular moment of that event?

613
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:09,320
Yeah, my, uh, older son and I went down, and, uh, and we're there. There's pictures and, uh,

614
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:17,320
and documentation, uh, you know, in the material that was there. And, uh, Robert McBicker was a president.

615
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:25,000
Jack Riley was the coach, and it was during, I think it was secondary to a game. I can't remember exactly.

616
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,320
I think it was. Very nice event. And then they didn't meet a speech. He was a very good presenter.

617
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:40,280
And, uh, the tell jokes. He was, you know, just, there's, I think, uh, I don't think it's a record of what

618
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,880
he said at that event, but there's some other information that there's some, he would write it out ahead of time.

619
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,920
So there's some things in there that he said, but he could, uh, he was good. Good on his feet.

620
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,880
Do you think I meant a lot to him that the, the field had been named after him, officially?

621
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,080
Oh, I think so. We have, we wouldn't, you know, and that was, uh, that was a source of pride,

622
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:10,280
but you're a nice honor for him. And, uh, after that, it sounds like he got another job in baseball,

623
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,480
the Portland Mar�le. He familiar with the history of the Portland Mar�le. Okay.

624
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:23,880
Well, he, uh, the Bing Russell, who is a actor, Western actor, the Portland Beaver franchise,

625
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,600
and then kind of left bacon, he picked this up for, for actually nothing. I think it was

626
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:35,560
partly to provide a venue for Kurt, who is some Kurt Russell to play, who is quite an acting baseball player.

627
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:42,920
And the Mavericks were independent, the own team. They weren't owned by any other, major league team or anything like that.

628
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:49,640
And these were just free agents, some pros, some amateurs, and, uh, Bing Russell hired somebody to

629
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,880
manage the team, and he would be around with these players up. And they played, and he, uh, it wasn't

630
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:02,760
AAA, it was, uh, maybe a AA level down the moment we'll see. And, uh, I think there's a movie being

631
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:11,480
made about, you know, being books for things like that. And, uh, they were a very flamboyant, you know,

632
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:22,760
bunch, and, uh, and, uh, when, at one point, Frank Peters, then he, he did. Okay, he was in Oregon State,

633
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:29,720
baseball player, basketball player played on that final four, basketball team. And it played

634
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:38,120
professional baseball, and he was hired as the manager. And, uh, he hired my dad to be his third

635
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:45,480
base coach. He played for my dad. And so, uh, there's a Mavericks hat around the house somewhere,

636
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:52,840
so he spent two or three seasons, you know, helping, you know, manage the board of Mavericks.

637
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:01,320
That was later on with pretty late in his life. Right. Yeah. Okay, so let's turn the attention to you now.

638
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:08,200
Um, you were born and raised in Corvals, and interested in knowing the Corvals that you knew

639
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,720
the Grand Rapids, a boy, small town all the way. Everything just revolved around the campus.

640
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:20,680
Summer time, everything just quit. Everybody just tended their yards and lay around, uh, you know,

641
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,920
they didn't have much in the way of summer school. Oh, uh, they did have a summer school. One of my

642
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,600
dad's, uh, assignments was to work with the summer students and setting up, uh, to field trips.

643
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:40,040
They go to, you know, uh, the bodybuild dam and Timberline Mods and all the coast and he organized.

644
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,720
He just loved this kind of thing, you know. And so, but it was, uh, it was nice place to be in the summer.

645
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:55,720
Everybody was going on and, uh, the Corvals calendar was Oregon State's calendar, you know,

646
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,280
New Year's Day was when school started in the fall. You know, like wasn't in, wasn't in January.

647
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:08,600
Because everything just focused on the activities on campus and, uh, most everybody, you know,

648
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,040
worked for the Kent College. One, you know, directly you're indirectly, uh, wasn't an excuse for

649
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,880
girl. I wasn't being there, but I had been for Oregon State. So, and it was, uh,

650
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:26,120
it was, uh, it was a very nice, uh, place to grow up. Campus was our playground, uh, uh, uh,

651
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,840
the kids, you know, we just, you know, how to get into every building and, uh, in the

652
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:37,880
be saying, you know, we needed to get into, uh, uh, uh, uh, our parents didn't know what we were doing.

653
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,720
I don't think they wanted that what we were doing. So it was a, it was a, it was a playground.

654
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
As you got a little bit older, and to say, the high school age,

655
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,400
we're, we're going to the places that the kids congregated. You mean, Jim Caballas? Yeah.

656
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,960
Well, there was some, there was some, uh, there was some drive-ins,

657
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,760
and there was a drive-in theater, uh, between Aubrey and Caballas,

658
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,920
that was a fun place to be. There were places outtown, uh, restaurants. I don't remember

659
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,080
having any particular, it was kind of like, uh, American graffiti. Did you ever see

660
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,880
American graffiti? And there was a lot like, Caballas was a lot like the American

661
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,080
graffiti, uh, you know, on the odds. Very nice place to grow up.

662
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:32,280
Everybody kind of had their, their, their, uh, activities, you know, everybody guard

663
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,360
mothers all collected antiques and played bridge, and most of the mothers didn't work,

664
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,440
faculty wives, they weren't jobs. First of all, it wasn't, uh,

665
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,840
I don't think it was considered a, uh, quite as socially acceptable for mothers to be working.

666
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,760
It wasn't kind of an admission that you needed the money, you know what I mean?

667
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:02,440
So, there really had lots of time, there wasn't much, there weren't very many organized

668
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,240
activities, you know, we kids, we just did what we wanted to do,

669
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:14,680
if they were the home for dinner, you know, when that was it. So, what sort of impact do you,

670
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:19,800
do you remember the depression having on the town? It sounds like the, the faculty refer

671
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:26,360
to the, you know, the economic impact. But, well, that was my impression, you know, I didn't,

672
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:32,760
I wasn't the hardly aware of the depression, uh, it was just the way things were. I was born in

673
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:40,840
1931, of course, that's just when it, uh, was, uh, in its worst. And, uh, it didn't affect the,

674
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,440
the university, you can't always let that match, everybody, uh, I don't think they had much

675
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,640
the way it cutbacks. I think, although I can't, I couldn't document it, there were times when

676
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,640
they did not get paid at all, but the state they were given, I'll use, and I think they were honored

677
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:06,120
later on. But, uh, that was, it was, uh, it kept me thin. And, of course, there were migrants in

678
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:12,600
Krabalus and, uh, show up at our back door and want food and that sort of thing. So,

679
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,200
it was, it was there. And, uh, of course, World War II came along and ended that, and I heard,

680
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,400
well, that's my next question is, well, how did this, how did the town respond to World War II?

681
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,800
What was it like during that period? It's like, well, of course, there were no men around.

682
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:39,240
They had, uh, a, uh, ASTP programs and anything to it. It was an Army sponsored program for soldiers

683
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,240
to go to college. Then I think they became officers at the end of it. So, there's an ASTP program,

684
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:51,880
but these are soldiers, essentially, assigned to that role. And, as far as men went on campus, that was

685
00:57:51,880 --> 00:58:02,200
about, yeah, the women lived in the fraternity houses and, uh, uh, uh, but the school kept going,

686
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:10,040
but, uh, you know, the war was having a big impact on it. Was it there in the midst of its

687
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,520
Yes, it was nice. Yes, uh, camped air was had a huge impact on prevallus and Albany.

688
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,800
And, uh, it, uh, you know, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a basic, well, you know, of camped air.

689
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:30,040
It was a, for basic infantry, infantry, basic training. I think they put forward divisions,

690
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,880
infantry divisions through their three or four years, it was right. And that's a lot of soldiers.

691
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:42,200
We had, we had one living in our house. We always had one living in our house with us,

692
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:48,840
and I put that back. So, we didn't have soldiers living there. We had his wife living there.

693
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:56,360
In our spare bedroom, and this was pretty typical. The wives would follow the soldiers out

694
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:02,040
to be around in their basic training. And these guys get released from, you know, camped air

695
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:08,680
for weekend or something, and here, and caught up the stairs at night. You know, the GI boots

696
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,840
and down the next morning. And so, uh, so that was pretty standard, too. So, the city was, you know,

697
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,640
supporting that effort. My mother was a great lady, and this kind of a nurses auxiliary

698
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:31,160
volunteer that a hospital that camped air. And, uh, they were, uh, uniforms. They worked in the military,

699
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:38,920
anything, but they would write letters for soldiers and, uh, keep them company in the hospital,

700
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:45,960
unless, and so she did that during the whole war. This is a volunteer. We were able to go out

701
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,480
here there, and all of us at off limits. I don't remember going on the base during the war,

702
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,280
afterwards I did, once the war was over. Why didn't I take that back? We did go out there, because

703
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:04,200
we were in the gym doing something. Oh, I know, yeah, my dad had, uh, during what they construction

704
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,000
of it, they had a baseball league. Her saltball wanted to have my dad coached one of those teams,

705
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:20,360
the construction teams. And, uh, so I was on the camped air a couple of times. And one time we were in

706
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:27,960
the gym, I guess it would be, and there was a whole slug of, uh, few W's in there. We were

707
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:34,760
storing few W's in the camped air during the war, and these were, uh, African corps,

708
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:43,160
guys, Germans, and by they were tough looking bunch. And then there were also Italians around,

709
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:48,440
and they were, so, you know, they were more open than friendly and stuff. So they were being housed there.

710
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,320
I don't know if they ever were escaped or not, but they didn't look like the security was retired.

711
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,440
They had it pretty well. Pretty good as it was. That's interesting. I had none about that.

712
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,200
They expansive it there. It's amazing when you see it now. The expansive it there was,

713
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,200
it was amazing when you see it now. It's quite, and it's, there's not a lot there. It was,

714
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:15,560
it must be the second biggest, uh, in Oregon. No, it was huge. Uh, covered maps about that in our

715
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,880
range. The camped air, you eat a lot of the greets for an artillery range, and we could

716
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,360
hear moving away from the war. You mentioned in your memoir that the family traveled to San Francisco

717
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,920
for the world's fair in 1939. Oh, yeah. Do you remember that at all? Oh, yeah. That was, uh,

718
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,760
green out in me, and we stayed with my green aunt lived in San Francisco.

719
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:47,400
And, uh, yeah, that was a nice, nice event. It takes your time of a lot of other facts from that.

720
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Um, well, tell me about high school at Coral's high school. You're the senior class president.

721
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,760
I want to indeed, uh, and, uh, had a lot of fun in high school. You know,

722
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,400
I did a lot of people don't have good experiences in high school, but I had good experiences.

723
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,440
You know, everything wasn't 100%, but, you know, I was on the baseball team and the golf team.

724
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:19,000
And, uh, you know, had good friends and had a nice time. Uh, we won the state high school

725
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,400
basketball championship. I was a junior. I wasn't on the team, but that was,

726
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,480
doesn't get any better than that when you're in the high school, you know, to have the

727
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,960
win the state basketball championship. We meant the decision to go to Oregon State College.

728
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,840
It sounds like there was, there wasn't much of a decision. I mean, there was no, that was kind of data.

729
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,960
That was, you know, I don't, I can't think of anybody in my class high school graduate class

730
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:53,960
that did go anywhere else. You know, initially. And, uh, there were a lot of faculty kids

731
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,160
throughout Wisconsin. Obviously, so they were going to go to college, but that was the

732
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,600
closest one and the most affordable. So that's kind of where we all ended up. Yeah.

733
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,680
What was it like playing in your dad's baseball program? Fine. You'd get a good time.

734
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:18,920
Have a great time. And, uh, it was, uh, you know, no stress. Everybody accepted it and, uh,

735
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,160
had a good time. Yeah. That seems to be, it was a real honor, you know, for me.

736
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:35,160
You played center baseball. Yeah. That's what everybody did in those days.

737
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:42,360
There was on the baseball team because, uh, you know, my dad and one, we want to be playing.

738
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:50,120
And he won, you know, his players did playing too. And, uh, we'd be hired. We'd be sent out

739
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,240
to these small towns every town had a baseball team, a semi-pro baseball team, which means

740
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,280
semi-pro means professionals, ex-professionals could play on the team.

741
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,520
Back in those days, that it was a no-no in terms of, uh, amateur status,

742
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,640
who are supposed to play with pros, with the main exception for baseball. So,

743
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:18,760
these town teams that have some ex-pros and some college guys and some locals. And, uh,

744
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,960
he was a big deal for the town and they could get his jobs, you know,

745
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,520
we're going to the woods or pulling on the green chain or something like that.

746
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:33,880
And that was about what was out there and the mill pond job. I was not, that was not a,

747
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,760
I was living in Krivalas as summer and they gave you.

748
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:45,560
As a summer, we went to, uh, Air Force Base and whatnot. Anyway, uh, that was a mill,

749
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,320
south of Monroe, and, um, had been mill pond. And yeah, that was a,

750
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:58,680
that was a dangerous job and a tough one. We'll tell some more about what that job until.

751
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:08,200
Well, uh, every saw mill had a, uh, a mill pond that were, uh, store logs and, uh,

752
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,760
then the logs would be brought up to the, uh, or the, or there was a conveyor belt.

753
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,520
And then we'd be then lifted, uh, convey into the saw mill and cut into the boards.

754
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,320
And, uh, the people that moved the logs around were called pound pond monkeys.

755
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,400
And you're out there in your court boots and you're, we pull them all with.

756
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,640
And, uh, trying to carry out these logs and, uh, you know, pushing across the pond and getting

757
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:43,560
over to the, where they'd be picked up. And there about five of the same, uh, pond monkeys.

758
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:49,720
And none of us knew what we were doing. And they dumped the logs and one end of the pond of log trucks.

759
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:56,520
And then we gathered up five or six of these, or eight of them, wrapped and propelled across the,

760
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:04,280
across the pond. And then, uh, they lived at, there were a couple of, uh, professional pond monkeys there.

761
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:10,200
And they were just split around, you know, flying across the logs and we were in the water half the time.

762
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,480
Interesting experience. And this terrible water, you know, with, uh, like I said,

763
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,400
but my mother wouldn't let me in the house, you know, they could smell some air.

764
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:28,200
So that's what we did. That was those, the jobs are available in them wage, no unions, you know,

765
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,800
so you're just totally the mercy of, uh, you know, uh, owner.

766
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,160
But there were guys that was, you know, that was a career for a lot of people.

767
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,120
You know, for us at least, there was just a summer experience.

768
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:50,840
So it was a great incentive to, uh, believe me, you know, to stay in college and find something better.

769
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,280
Because that's where a lot of these guys were going to spend their lives, you know,

770
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:59,480
corner of the region and sort of thing. Oh, and that's a much just in characters.

771
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,560
I'm sure. Yeah. And then that was spent summers in co-keel and brookings.

772
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,680
Doing that sorts of jobs. Played for their town team.

773
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,760
Some rough and humble towns. They were, they were indeed.

774
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Cowboys, Indians, and fishermen,

775
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,680
loggers, you know, he spent a summer in primal too.

776
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,520
Right, primal. Yeah, co-keel, brookings, and primal, those are my three stars.

777
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:40,600
Well, you know, that dealt with Slon too. I was, yeah, I was a legacy and, uh, looked at other houses,

778
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,120
but they had a nice combination. I thought, uh, athletes and scholars and

779
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,080
wee schools, you know, didn't take themselves too seriously.

780
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,200
They were, you know, a good bunch of guys. And, uh, so I never had any regrets about that.

781
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,440
That worked out pretty well. Nice, nice group.

782
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,440
Um, you mentioned that, if I take out a fraternity,

783
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,560
I don't know if prank is the right word for it, but there's a story

784
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:12,040
involving skim race beauty in Oregon. Yeah, you used to Oregon. No, they had a, we had a

785
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:18,120
genius for, you're coming up with stuff like that. No, that's a true story.

786
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:24,520
And, uh, when I was a freshman, my freshman class, I didn't have to go on that, but they

787
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,080
went down and we looked piece of it off, they didn't get the whole thing. But they did

788
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,680
dynamite some of it off, you know, the skimmers do. Never had caught me to back.

789
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,800
And, uh, two years later, went back and really, you know, got the whole thing this time.

790
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:45,880
And it was, uh, it, uh, they also got the way with that, you know, the FBI was

791
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,920
interviewing everybody on campus, and I'll try to get a handle on who is dynamite was considered

792
01:08:52,920 --> 01:09:00,040
a, you know, but the age of substance, and they steal it from the stump, the last in class,

793
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:04,600
or you're standing there with an egg school, and sometimes the class. So these guys

794
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:12,600
steal dynamite, the caps, nutty, you know, just nutty. But, uh, they never caught out,

795
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:18,280
he did it. Uh, and this is the big, oh, there's a big, oh, and it's a big concrete, oh.

796
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:25,960
And then, then the, uh, the guys that didn't went back later, and they'd gather up pieces,

797
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,920
chunks of it, and everybody had, and the house had a chunk of this, oh, when they're going

798
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,440
to get the other desk. The paint, I don't know, it was about that thick, you know,

799
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,120
it'd been painted, so the, you're, back in the comma days, you know, where you stay,

800
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,440
would be down in a painted orange, and then, where I get to get up the next day,

801
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,920
and paint yellow, so that would happen a lot, but I, I think that was the last time

802
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:54,360
but it would've, uh, it'd've got the whole lot. Last time. I don't remember if you,

803
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,160
you know, interesting size, or I was not as a game in lots in one time years, years later,

804
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:07,680
And, and I was relating this story, you know, but my fraternity being, you know, I

805
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,600
mean dynamite of the old, scared of the guy behind me, he says, came around, he says, is that

806
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,600
a true story?

807
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,720
And he said, you know, you read the guys, I didn't that, and I said, yeah, he said, I wrote

808
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:26,600
my master's thesis on that, on the dynamite of the old, so it was a story that, you know,

809
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,600
I had legs at least.

810
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Well, what was social like like for you in school?

811
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Rich?

812
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
No.

813
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
Very good.

814
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,600
Where you stayed was a nice friendly place, and there were too many men and not enough women,

815
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,600
you know, student body was mostly, you know, a high school, injury school, and all

816
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
of that.

817
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,600
So, men out and over the women, but it was good.

818
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,600
We had a lot of fun.

819
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,600
It was, if you lived on campus, which most of us did, we lived in our fraternity.

820
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
You were in that like a different universe.

821
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,600
You know, your parents were glad to have you out of the house, and you were glad to be out

822
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
of the house.

823
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,600
And you might as well be in a Chicago, you know, the amount of interaction that took place

824
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
this wasn't any.

825
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
Yeah.

826
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
What sort of events were important on the social calendar?

827
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
All house dances.

828
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:20,600
You know, I said, one major, every house that had one major house dance, every quarter.

829
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,600
And those were big events.

830
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,600
And, you know, if you were dating somebody, you'd get invited to the her house dance,

831
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,600
and she invited you to invite your yours and so on.

832
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
So, there's a lot of that.

833
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,600
And a lot of beer drinking out of Murphy's Beach and Murphy's Beach is.

834
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
You know, south of town.

835
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
There's a tavern.

836
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,600
We've got about two or three miles out of town on the right-hand side.

837
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
And a whole Murphy's.

838
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
That's called Murphy's.

839
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
Okay.

840
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Well, just past that half a mile, there's a road that goes off to the east.

841
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,600
I went down to the river.

842
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,600
And I think there's, I don't know, what's down there now.

843
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,600
But back then, it was a gravel operation.

844
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,600
And this is where all the part you took place.

845
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
This is called a burst beach.

846
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
And nothing to do with the tavern.

847
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,600
But that was where everybody gathered.

848
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,600
It's a new one to me.

849
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
That's a new one for me.

850
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
Oh, yeah.

851
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
That was the place.

852
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,600
And, you know, if anybody wanted to do a rest of this,

853
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,600
or a rest of this, or a hospitalist, right?

854
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
Everybody knew where we were.

855
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,600
And it wasn't just my fraternity.

856
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
Everybody was out there.

857
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,600
You know, the football team, the basketball team, everybody.

858
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
You know.

859
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
So, a lot of partying going on.

860
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,600
I don't think anything has changed.

861
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
I don't think.

862
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,600
We played baseball in the springs.

863
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,600
And the springs in the summer.

864
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Did you do anything in the fall or winter be ready for the season?

865
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
Or is it just being a role student?

866
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,600
I think once the season was over, we were done.

867
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,600
I don't remember any particular.

868
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,600
Each season, you know, each football season, basketball season,

869
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
baseball season, baseball season.

870
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,600
They had to start to stop time.

871
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,600
And, you know, we have guys that played three sports.

872
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,600
And, uh, throwing a state.

873
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Three major sports.

874
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,600
Started in each year every team.

875
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
So, you can do that, then.

876
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
And I don't think that's.

877
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Can they do that now?

878
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Thanks, okay.

879
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I think very few do if they could.

880
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Yeah.

881
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Now, how about school?

882
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,600
How about what was your academic experience like?

883
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,600
I was a moderate success, modest success.

884
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,600
I was a business administration.

885
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,600
And that wasn't a very stimulating, you know, major for me.

886
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,600
And, you know, I made my grades.

887
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,600
And, I was only on probation once.

888
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,600
So, that's not too bad for four and a half years.

889
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,600
So, but I graduated.

890
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,600
Any teachers about that made any impact on you?

891
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Pardon?

892
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,600
Any teachers?

893
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,600
You know, Gordon guilty.

894
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
Gordon guilty.

895
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,600
He was a good teacher.

896
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,600
I, you know, this is a long time ago.

897
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Can you tell me more about him?

898
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,600
I'm interested in guilty.

899
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,600
Well, Gordon, you know, had, uh, he'd been in Europe during the Second World War.

900
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,600
And had, uh, with some of those people that participated in,

901
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,600
saving the, you know, uncovering the German stations of art and so on.

902
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,600
And, uh, I really made a major contribution there.

903
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,600
And then he was a, also, a woodblock print collector.

904
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,600
And a huge Japanese woodblock print collection.

905
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,600
And taught, of course, clothes.

906
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,600
Serbated visual arts or something.

907
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Anyway, it was a review of, you know, art and history and so on.

908
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Fascinating course.

909
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,600
He taught that every year.

910
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
And then, uh, later on, he became,

911
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Dean, I think, of liberal arts to me.

912
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,600
I think so.

913
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Yeah.

914
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
And he lived right around the corner of the entire,

915
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
or you stayed.

916
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,600
He was a good guy.

917
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Is some was there, some was a photographer.

918
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,600
Yeah.

919
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,600
Yeah.

920
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Yeah.

921
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,600
Yeah.

922
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:17,600
I'm going to ask you a little bit about the climate on campus during the time you were there.

923
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,600
You were, uh, they're towards the end.

924
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,600
I think the, uh, large influx of GI Bill students.

925
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,600
And you're mentioned in, in your memoir,

926
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
they were somewhat belief.

927
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Oh, yeah.

928
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
And I'm, I'm guessing that you have a sense of,

929
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,600
of why from your own military experience.

930
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,600
But can you talk a little bit about the GI influence on campus?

931
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Well, it was huge.

932
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,600
You know, uh, first there was a huge number of them.

933
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,600
And then, a lot of them are married.

934
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
They're older.

935
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Uh, these guys, you know, they weren't interested in the morning.

936
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Booklets or any of that stuff.

937
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
That just went by the boards.

938
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,600
You know, they weren't having any of it.

939
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,600
You know, these wanted to get in there.

940
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Get their education and get on with their lives.

941
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,600
And so that changed the whole campus tender.

942
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,600
You know, totally.

943
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,600
And then here at the Walinkay, my group, you know,

944
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,600
maybe to a high school graduate,

945
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,600
and never, you know, get any, you know,

946
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
get any of it on anything.

947
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,600
And they're all the upper, the upper two classes in the

948
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,600
fraternity house were all a little more two guys.

949
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,600
And they ran the, these, they ran these fraternities like,

950
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,600
boot camps.

951
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,600
The, the guy down the hall for me,

952
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,600
one of the seniors.

953
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
I think it's a senior there by that timing.

954
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,600
Bob Kyle.

955
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,600
He didn't wounded in the Battle of the Bulge.

956
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,600
You know, he didn't mess around with those guys, you know?

957
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
And they didn't take any, you know,

958
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,600
they were very serious and very business-like.

959
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
And they were good role models, you know,

960
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,600
we learned from those guys.

961
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,600
So yeah, they changed the whole campus.

962
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,600
Philosophy has turned it upside down.

963
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,600
And then they were, I started in 1949.

964
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,600
So they were kind of a tail end of it.

965
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,600
And once it came along after me,

966
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
none of us had ever been in the military.

967
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,600
Some, occasionally, were the Korean War came along,

968
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
and that changed a lot of things.

969
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,600
We had a lot of Korean War veterans around that.

970
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,600
So did the Brooklyn tradition die out at that point?

971
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
I mean, that was very strong before then.

972
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,600
What's that?

973
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,600
The Brooklyn's, and things like that, that this deceased is,

974
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Yeah.

975
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,600
Yeah, that just sort of, any people tried to get it back in place,

976
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,600
but if I don't think it ever would be,

977
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,600
it wasn't the same as it had been.

978
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,600
And things were changing anyway.

979
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,600
You know, it wasn't just the World War II events.

980
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,600
The whole world had changed.

981
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,600
You know, the Second World War just changed everything.

982
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,600
Whole majors didn't matter anymore.

983
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,600
You know, new technologies coming on.

984
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,600
So the very revolutionary, in retrospect,

985
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,600
in a very revolutionary period.

986
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Yeah.

987
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Well, and you mentioned that some,

988
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,600
I'm trying to ask about the, the subject of race,

989
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,600
and especially the example of the man who you write about in your book.

990
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,600
It was not a revolution on campus by any stretch,

991
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,600
but it's an inkling of a very gradual change.

992
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,600
It was going to come later in terms of the topic of race.

993
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
It looks you.

994
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Well, or you say it was a pretty pretty,

995
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,600
one race institution at the time.

996
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,600
We had black students from Africa,

997
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,600
change students, and Asians, of course,

998
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,600
been around for a long time.

999
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,600
So it wasn't totally white, but it was predominantly.

1000
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,600
And there were no black athletes.

1001
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Oregon had black athletes in the 30s.

1002
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,600
Football players, Jackie Robinson's,

1003
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,600
who were brother.

1004
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Mac was a track man at Oregon.

1005
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,600
And so Oregon State was, you know,

1006
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,600
late to the game.

1007
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,600
And Dave Man was recruited out of California

1008
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,600
to come and be Oregon State's first black athlete,

1009
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,600
which he was.

1010
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,600
And it was a very successful.

1011
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,600
And I didn't know him very well personally,

1012
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,600
but he was, he stood out on question about it.

1013
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,600
And he was, he was not a,

1014
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,600
what would you call, he was not a self-refacing person

1015
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,600
that a good way to put it.

1016
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,600
But not a bad person.

1017
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,600
I mean, he didn't cause any problems or anything.

1018
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,600
He just, he was new to, you know,

1019
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
this was a new thing in Oregon State,

1020
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
and the Corvellus.

1021
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah, confident day.

1022
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,600
Yeah, very confident.

1023
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,600
Good athlete.

1024
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,600
Didn't take any stuff, you know.

1025
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
He wanted campus boxing training.

1026
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,600
It was fascinating.

1027
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,600
There was a campus boxing training.

1028
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Yeah, intermural.

1029
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
It wasn't well.

1030
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
It was, yeah, intermural.

1031
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,600
And yeah, it just three, three,

1032
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,600
three, three roundabouts.

1033
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Yeah, he wasn't that.

1034
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Was this a period of time where there were many

1035
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
concert sets on campus?

1036
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,600
Still were.

1037
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,600
And what was that like, did you have

1038
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
did you have classes in them or?

1039
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,600
You know, I don't remember having.

1040
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,600
I think they were mostly used for hot space.

1041
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Meeting rooms and things like that.

1042
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,600
They weren't big enough ready for a classroom.

1043
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
So just reflective of a period of expansion.

1044
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,600
Can't rest in the influx of new students.

1045
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,600
Yeah.

1046
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,600
I'll ask you about a couple of things that happened at,

1047
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
at OSC during your time,

1048
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,600
but in 1950, Gil Call Seam opened.

1049
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,600
Do you remember, do you remember that?

1050
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,600
Well, I don't remember having any major event.

1051
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
You know, it had been coming for a long time.

1052
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
It just didn't magically appear.

1053
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
You know, everybody knew it was coming.

1054
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
It was, yeah, it wasn't big event.

1055
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,600
It was a state of the art at the time.

1056
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,600
You know, that was.

1057
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,600
The rest dates, that's what it facilities were.

1058
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
First class, parker.

1059
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
Field was new.

1060
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Oregon had rigging wooden stands.

1061
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,600
Still when California schools had big stadiums.

1062
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,600
But, you know, Oregon states,

1063
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
or so was a pretty good spec key.

1064
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,600
It was responsible for most of that.

1065
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Really?

1066
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,600
Yeah.

1067
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,600
Do you have recollections of attending basketball games in the old men's gym?

1068
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
Yes, I did.

1069
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:21,600
So, slides field, teams, knockover, DCOA, twice in a row.

1070
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,600
Yeah, I get polled.

1071
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,600
It held 2,000 people.

1072
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Yeah.

1073
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,600
There was about anything around all the way around the men's gym.

1074
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
And that, you know, the two.

1075
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Yeah.

1076
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
So, yeah.

1077
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Yeah.

1078
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,600
I started going there when I was probably,

1079
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,600
four or five years old.

1080
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,600
It must have been quite an environment.

1081
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,600
Get what it was.

1082
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Just athletics all the way.

1083
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,600
How about football at Belle Field?

1084
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,600
Well, it was a mud bowl, sort of was.

1085
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,600
You know.

1086
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:55,600
And you're close to the field.

1087
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,600
But the student section was on the west side.

1088
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:07,600
And in those days, if you can believe it, the COVID's all wore heels and stockings and hats.

1089
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
Just the game.

1090
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
Imagine that?

1091
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Yeah.

1092
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,600
That's amazing.

1093
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Well, so we sort of wind up here a little bit.

1094
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,600
I'm interested in knowing about your continued association with OSU after you graduated.

1095
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Obviously, we had a career in military.

1096
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,600
We went on to other things, graduate studies and career.

1097
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Well, when I came, I left where you stayed in 1954, spring of 1954, came back in 66 or 67 or something like that.

1098
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,600
And I lived in Chicago and Evan Stein, Lincoln Nebraska and Pennsylvania and other places.

1099
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,600
You know, the kind of stops you make.

1100
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,600
And then it was hired by, or, you know, sciences university recruited by them.

1101
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,600
You know, a certain role they were looking for.

1102
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,600
And came back.

1103
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:07,600
And my dad had just retired for your state, so there wasn't any of that overlapping.

1104
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,600
But he was, of course, very closely involved.

1105
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,600
And, you know, he had season tickets, so I just picked up going to the football games.

1106
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,600
And, you know, that sort of thing.

1107
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,600
But that I wasn't, you know, associating the Oregon State in any direct professional.

1108
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Capacity.

1109
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,600
But it was still part of our lives.

1110
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:36,600
And then, you know, I was a lifetime member of the life member of the Illinois Association.

1111
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,600
The varsity O was kind of kicking you out a little bit.

1112
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,600
They were getting things going.

1113
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,600
And then the baseball field project came on.

1114
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,600
Pat Casey put that together and asked me if I would be on their committee.

1115
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,600
And did was, and, you know, the fundraising committee.

1116
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:04,600
And we were successful largely because of the $1 billion grant from the Goss John Goss,

1117
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:11,600
who had sold a piece of property and was going to pay a huge tax bill, so he decided to do something with it.

1118
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,600
And that got kicked back started.

1119
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,600
And he'd put it in there.

1120
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,600
This wasn't, you know, he, I don't know how many years he had been coaching,

1121
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,600
but I bet it was close to 10 of the time the stadium project came along.

1122
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,600
So, you know, you think of the baseball project.

1123
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
And I think the whole program is a project.

1124
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,600
You know, it's so different from what it was, you know, back in the day.

1125
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,600
It's patting, you know, overnight success.

1126
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,600
You know, it just came in and winged the magic wander.

1127
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
They happened.

1128
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,600
But that's not the case at all.

1129
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
He started going to the Brownsville.

1130
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,600
And they didn't even charge for baseball games when Jack Wright was there.

1131
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,600
And even in Pat's early days, he could just walk in any time, you know, free.

1132
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,600
And, but he is a, I think a remarkable person, a remarkable developer.

1133
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,600
I think he would have done well whenever he was, you know,

1134
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,600
like a very good state that he chose baseball.

1135
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,600
But he has, he's a talented person, you know, not your normal,

1136
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
just your regular everyday coach.

1137
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,600
And he spearheaded this, and we meet up here in Portland.

1138
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,600
And we, you know, tap people we knew.

1139
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,600
And, and there are some major donors that stepped up.

1140
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,600
And, uh, they're built.

1141
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,600
So that was a huge, that was a real sea change, you know,

1142
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
the baseball program they have that facility.

1143
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,600
It was interesting because prior to that time,

1144
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,600
even Jack Riley and Tencelli and others might have done something similar.

1145
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,600
But, uh, until...

1146
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,600
Can't remember which one of the presidency was.

1147
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,600
It was after the bigger public burn.

1148
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
Could have been.

1149
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,600
No, no wasn't.

1150
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,600
It was after him, either.

1151
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Yes, sir.

1152
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,600
All right, sir.

1153
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,600
I think it was Paul Richard Wright.

1154
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:05,600
Said it would be OK to build a permanent facility on that location.

1155
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,600
But the university's policy prior that time,

1156
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,600
I've always been that this was too valuable piece of property.

1157
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,600
You know, it is right.

1158
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,600
Not the center campus, but it's right on campus.

1159
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,600
And they want to put dorms there and things like that.

1160
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Well, so they wouldn't permit any kind of improvement in facilities.

1161
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Nothing.

1162
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,600
Until the visitors said, okay, you can do this.

1163
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,600
And then that will put the door for a pat to go out and begin to

1164
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
and then John Goss coming along.

1165
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,600
But those two things came together and made it possible to put a permanent facility on that site.

1166
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,600
You know, it's the oldest baseball field in college baseball.

1167
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,600
Well, it is the oldest or the second oldest.

1168
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
I think there might be some dispute about that.

1169
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,600
But it's one or the two.

1170
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,600
And somebody wanted out their one day in 1907 and drove a stake in the ground.

1171
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,600
This will be owned late.

1172
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,600
But it's never moved.

1173
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,600
You know, it's been a big success.

1174
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,600
I think that was a good for Pat, good for the program.

1175
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
I think it made it possible to recruit.

1176
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
That's everything at baseball.

1177
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,600
And Pat, now with his reputation, he just recruits nationally.

1178
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,600
You know, he doesn't recruit.

1179
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,600
He just answers phone calls basically.

1180
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,600
Stowning success.

1181
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,600
You know, somebody said everything went to their one day first college world series.

1182
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,600
And I said, what would your dad, what would your dad feel about that?

1183
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,600
Yeah, but he'd be proud.

1184
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,600
Nice.

1185
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,600
And he'd be dumbfounded this way.

1186
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:39,600
Just, you know, considering the facilities of the attitudes and so on.

1187
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,600
So he's, he's at a remarkable remarkable job.

1188
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,600
Yeah.

1189
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,600
Well, the last thing I want to ask you about is just your thoughts on the current direction of the university.

1190
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
Things have changed my early last few years.

1191
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,600
And there's a lot of momentum heading in different directions.

1192
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,600
What do you think of all this?

1193
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,600
Well, I think or you say it's got a really a lot to be proud of.

1194
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:03,600
I think, you know, the current administration has really been in place long enough.

1195
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,600
I think it's been, there's continuity there.

1196
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:12,600
There was some, you know, most of the presidents stay more than four or five years.

1197
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,600
It's that, you know, they move on to their things.

1198
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,600
So I think that continuity has been important.

1199
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,600
And I think they play the funding game very well.

1200
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,600
You know, the technology grants and all this sort of thing.

1201
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,600
I don't follow it with the microscope.

1202
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,600
But I don't think they have the reputation of the deserve.

1203
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,600
I think it's not, not read their fault.

1204
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,600
Every institution has areas with excellence.

1205
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,600
And where you state is certainly no exception.

1206
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,600
But it's not the kind of thing that gets the headlines.

1207
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,600
So, but no, I think I think it's, it's a really fine institution.

1208
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,600
I know, when my older son went there and had a great time.

1209
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:12,600
So, and they just completed a big fundraising campaign.

1210
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
Yeah, just about a billion dollars.

1211
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
Billion?

1212
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,600
Was that, yeah?

1213
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,600
One of the better campaigns around the country, I guess, wouldn't that?

1214
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,600
Yeah.

1215
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,600
Yeah.

1216
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,600
I think so.

1217
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
So, they do a good job.

1218
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,600
I think, let me go against it.

1219
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:35,600
I think it's possible to get a good education there.

1220
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,600
I think one of the things that was kind of a negative, when I was there,

1221
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,600
they had virtually nothing in the way of liberal arts.

1222
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,600
And you could only take two years.

1223
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:51,600
They only offered liberal arts on the, you know, the undergrad or the lower division level.

1224
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,600
And that that closed out a lot of, you know, it's an age when you really ought to be looking around

1225
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,600
at, you know, other things.

1226
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
And the opportunities weren't there.

1227
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,600
You had to channel yourself into one of these technical oriented majors.

1228
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,600
It wasn't always a good fit for everybody.

1229
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:13,600
So, I think the fact that they expanded that, you know, that option is, I think,

1230
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,600
adds a lot to it.

1231
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,600
I think they really made that, that return the corner for them as far as I was concerned.

1232
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,600
I mean, they developed a liberal arts college and you could major in it this long.

1233
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,600
