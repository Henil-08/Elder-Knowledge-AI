1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now you can edit out any extraneous sounds like I have to clear my throat, not going to

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
stuff.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's start.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you would just introduce yourself.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is a statement name on today's date in our location.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Kenneth Hedberg.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The date is September 9th, 2011.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ken, where were you born and where did you go?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was born in Portland, Oregon, in February of the Second and 1920.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And you did you go to Portland?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, I actually know.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I spent my first six years of life there.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then my father had a job that took him to Southern Oregon.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I grew up in Oregon, a Kusbe region, which is that time where we lived as called Marshfield.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And after that we moved to Hokkaido, Washington where I spent my years from age about 12 to 16.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We were upon we moved to Medford.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I went to school, graduated from high school in Medford.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What were your various occupations?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, well, my mother was a housewife during the war.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She worked at the Naval Station in Astoria.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My father was called, or was called a wholesale grocery salesman.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In those days, groceries were delivered by truck from a large warehouse to the retailers.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And my father would travel to these small retail stores, some of them in outlying rural areas.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And take their orders for groceries, which he would then write up on a farm in the late evening.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Early in the morning, take it to the warehouse and the orders would be filled.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And the trucks would then take these groceries out to the various stores that had ordered them.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That, of course, passed pretty quickly in the time of better communications.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So that business is faded now.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So that was disappeared, actually.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That was a job that would require some moving around the family.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, well, my father had a, actually know that he changed jobs.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He worked for a company called Mason Irman, which is now out of business.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And they had several stores warehouse in southern Oregon and Medford in Kuspe, and in Astoria.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And he worked in all of these places for that company as they move things around.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The, that kind of, well, these rural stores were, of course, separated wide intervals.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And they were grouped together into what my father called a route or a route.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And on a given day of the week, he would go in a certain, on a certain route, take him all day long.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And the next day would go on a different run in the third day and so on.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it was a lot of driving and some of that over quite distance significant distances.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's about as much as I company around the few of these drives.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Just to keep him company, he seemed to like that.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But it was from my point of view, pretty boring.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'd sit in the car or go into the store while he took orders.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Of course, he'd have to stand around when the proprietor was waiting on customers because the customers were served first.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So there's a lot of waiting and watching.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm glad I wasn't in that business.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you have any siblings?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I had a sister. She died about three or four years ago.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I heard child, of course, we moved his family.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know nearly as much. She moved in a different group than I did.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She was two and a half years younger.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And so her high school group, the friends, or well-behind mind.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we didn't have much of a social interaction as kids.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We just had different groups we were with all the time.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She went to Oregon State for a couple of years.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then the work came along and she was a very good secretary.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And so she dropped out of school and served as a secretary to Naval Officer at the Naval Air Station in Astoria during the war.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And afterward, he set up a Ritter State business and so she went to California and served as the office manager for him.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And she married a young man from the area.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And so she lived most of her life in San Francisco, in the San Francisco area.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Actually, she retired over the...

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I forgot what it's called, the tunnel from the Bay Area across into the valley.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Pleasanton.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What were your hobbies as a boy?

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, in those days, we didn't have anything of the sort of thing they have now.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We had quite a lot of family interaction.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Evening, I remember when my father was home early enough and on weekends,

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
we played family cards like Rummy and Pinocchio and things like that.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The only source of entertainment, apart from the movies, was the radio.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I can still remember my father and mother eagerly listening to certain programs in the radio,

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
among which were Amos and Andy.

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know, that, yeah, Amos and Andy, and a few of the other things.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And as for activity, I took up tennis when I was in Hoke and I played tennis all my life,

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
including on Medford High School team and on the OSU team when I came here later.

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So that was a hobby.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And the other one was we had a lot of a group of pretty closely knit kids in the neighborhood

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and we played a lot of football, touch football in the streets.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And that's mostly, oh, I collected stamps, but that was, you know, everybody collected stamps in those days.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And that's about, I guess I kind of summarized as what it was, no cell phones, nothing, no TV, nothing like that.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you recall being interested in science as a way?

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I was always good in school, although I never really realized that I skipped a couple of grades.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
During the, my real interest in science developed, well, I was always interested in it,

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but it wasn't clear to me that I was going to be a scientist as a professional.

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And through high school and so on science was always easy for me, both physics and chemistry.

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And when I lived in Hoke, there were a number of people who always came to me with questions about science.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Excuse me, I didn't, we didn't have homework in the same way then, but it seemed to come so easily to me that I didn't

91
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
have much trouble answering the questions.

92
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And then when I graduated from high school in Medford, it was on the height of the depression and my father had just lost his job.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we were graduated in 1937 from Medford High School.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And there was no employment at all for young people.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There was some employment, which I avail myself of for several years.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I worked in the orchards, picking pairs, and so on and all again.

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You did all this by hand.

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And that's about the only income that I had.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's nothing that a young high school guy with no specific skills,

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
or money at, I moved along here and there for 25 or 50 cents, that's about the going right then.

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I made good money in the orchards when I worked there.

102
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It was very hard back-breaking, hopped, dusty work, but when you're young, that doesn't matter very much.

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So back to your question, after I graduated, I began to wonder what I was going to do.

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I know I wanted to go to college and my parents, neither of whom had gone to college.

105
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In fact, my father finished the eighth grade and my mother graduated from high school.

106
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That was a limit of their education.

107
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I always told me they wanted me to go to college and said that they would match every dollar I could earn.

108
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, they personally put an end to that, of course.

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So one day I went to the Medford Public Library.

110
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I still remember when I walked in, I checked out a book in physics, elementary physics,

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and another one in chemistry, and I took them home to read them.

112
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The physics that was exposed in those textbooks of the day was pretty elementary,

113
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
stuff, mechanics, levers, and sort of thing.

114
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The Manhattan Project, not radioactivity, that sort of thing was something that didn't penetrate

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the high school level in the textbooks of the time.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I finally decided I liked chemistry better.

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that started me on my career.

118
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I managed to in 1939 in the winter of 39.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We were as my father, as I said, lost his job, and he was important living with his brother,

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
trying to land another job.

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We had almost nothing in Medford, my mother and my sister and I,

122
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and I was able occasionally to provide a little better money for groceries.

123
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
My father tried to send money, but at one point we were enough destitute,

124
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
so that the power kept me turned off all the electricity, and we cooked with a stove with some wood.

125
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And we had a camping lantern, a coal and lantern that we used in the evening in the house.

126
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We managed to avoid getting thrown out of the house, which is a rental in Medford, but just barely.

127
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So for some reason, I'm not able to, at this day, remember how or why,

128
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
enough money was gotten together to allow me to register as Southern,

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
what was then called Southern Oregon Normal.

130
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, it's Southern Oregon University.

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's Southern Oregon State University, I guess, I don't know.

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And for 10 cents a day, I had a friend of the car, I could pay him,

133
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and I rode back and forth at him, stayed at home, and I registered for chemistry,

134
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and a few other things, and took a number of courses in music.

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And that continued, I got all these the first term.

136
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
My father told me, somebody in Portland had said,

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you know, there was a guy, kind of headbridge, I noticed,

138
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that all these Southern Oregon colleges, that's your son, my father knew nothing about this.

139
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I guess my mom didn't want to tell him that we had found money to send me to college,

140
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
but the tuition was a bag of tell, you know, something like $20 or $25 a term at that point.

141
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So he said, no, that can't be my son.

142
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When I turned all it was, he was not angry, he was delighted, actually.

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So I stayed the second term, and I got all these except for one,

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
which is a B in piano, I had taken a number of courses in music,

145
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and harmony, and composition, and things which interested me.

146
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And at the end of that time, excuse me,

147
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
this is going to show up on your, you're going to have to edit out these throat clarings.

148
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, at the end of that time, in the spring of 1939, my father actually got a job in Astoria,

149
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and he and my mother decided that rather than she going to Astoria to join him,

150
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
she would move to Corvallos, and allow my sister and me to matriculate at Oregon State,

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and she would set up a rooming house there, that rooming house would, we'd have three or four people,

152
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
staying with us, and she would do the cooking and so on,

153
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and the rampant and things that she collected when enabled us to maintain a house,

154
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
so my sister and I could go to school.

155
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That was done.

156
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And at the time I didn't realize what a sacrifice that was,

157
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
but as time has gone on, I can see that was a monumental contribution on their part,

158
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because I wouldn't have been able to go to Oregon State at all.

159
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Excuse me.

160
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, that was followed through, and I had one of scholarship tuition scholarship dollars use,

161
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
so I didn't have any tuition to pay, and then the National Youth Administration

162
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
was set up by Franklin Roosevelt, and this enabled students who qualified to earn 25 cents an hour,

163
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and I got a job in the chemistry department here at Oregon State,

164
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
handing out supplies to people who were in the laboratories.

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And that continued for 1941, a 40, and then late 1940,

166
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
my mother decided that we were now able to do this on our own,

167
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and so she moved, we closed the house, and she moved to Astoria,

168
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and I had pledged a fraternity, and so I had a place to live,

169
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and my sister moved into a co-op that Oregon State.

170
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And so I lived in my fraternity house for the rest of my career at OSU,

171
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I finished in December of 1942.

172
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which fraternity were you in?

173
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Tatekai.

174
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's still the same house, and in fact fraternity row there is not changed much at all.

175
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I guess the houses have been renovated, but my social connections of the fraternity are essentially zero.

176
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I have a lot of professional connections that I've spent my energy with.

177
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What was your social experience like in college?

178
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, the social experience was tremendous.

179
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My grandson is just mature, just enroled at

180
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
the hotel, thinking of the minimum.

181
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He wrote back, he's a very studious guy, and it's superb,

182
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
he wrote back to my daughter that I was funny with having,

183
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and she was greatly concerned that he wasn't studying.

184
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He's just landed on the campus, well, I told her that was my experience at OSU.

185
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know how much is known about those days,

186
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but there was a lot of social life, and the community was more strictly defined as,

187
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
as the independents, as they were called, and the Greeks, which concluded

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
all of the fraternity's priorities.

189
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And there were lots of social functions associated with the university

190
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
on the students behalf that I don't see now, but that may be because

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm a retired faculty member, but every Friday I think it was,

192
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
they had on the campus when I was a student, something called the Nickel Hops.

193
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And this meant that all the sororities, in particular,

194
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm not sure about the independence, but all the sororities,

195
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
cleared away the stuff on the living room, and they had

196
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
music that played, and men would move from one house to another,

197
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and you paid a nickel to enter and dance with the girls that were there.

198
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And so you'd go from one place to another.

199
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So that was one way easy way of getting acquainted with girls.

200
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The other important social affairs, or series of social affairs in the campus,

201
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
who are a bunch of formal dances, there was something called the sophomore

202
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
union, the junior prom, the senior ball,

203
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and then something called the military ball.

204
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It was put on by the oral chief secret of the piano and the campus.

205
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And these were formal dances.

206
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The women were long dresses, and the men were, on some occasions,

207
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
even took sedos.

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But no less than a dark suit,

209
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
or these ties everywhere.

210
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And they were events planned pretty much long in advance.

211
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So you got yourself what was called a dance card,

212
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and you went around to your friends, and the fraternity,

213
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
exchanged dances.

214
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You came with your girlfriend, of course.

215
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But you exchanged dances.

216
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You didn't dance with her at the whole evening.

217
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So you generally saved the last dance and the first dance

218
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
yourself on a couple in between, and then you would be

219
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
trading off with friends.

220
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know what happens these days, but I look back on that

221
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
with a good deal of fullness.

222
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It was lots of fun.

223
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The campus was highly regulated in the sense that

224
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
well, the put-on blunt terms it seems to me that the university

225
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
regarded itself and was looked at as a

226
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
defactal parent in the absence of a family, you see.

227
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So there were real restrictions, particularly on the women.

228
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If I remember this correctly, closing hours in all women's groups,

229
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there were very few married students, very few on the campus.

230
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I only knew one, one couple in chemistry.

231
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So the students generally lived in living groups.

232
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
A few of them had apartments, but not very many.

233
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And so these living groups, the women's living groups,

234
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
had strict closing hours.

235
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The women had to be in by 930 on a school night.

236
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That meant they were going to a library.

237
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
They were out of their living group at 7 o'clock in the

238
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
library.

239
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And of course they could meet boyfriends and so on there.

240
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Or you could arrange with your girlfriend a meter at one of

241
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the Monroe Street places that sort of coaxed.

242
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Have a coax or something like that.

243
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But they had to be in by 930.

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And if they weren't, if they were late,

245
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
they could be penalized by having their...

246
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm forgotten.

247
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Appendent penalties vary quite a lot, but they could be

248
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
campus which meant that they had to stay in their living group.

249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
They weren't allowed to do certain things that they

250
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
otherwise would have been allowed to do.

251
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The men had no restrictions on at all.

252
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And in my house there was a real

253
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
strongly enforced study hours from 7 to 9.

254
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The house was supposed to be very quiet and it was.

255
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So I could name you

256
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
a flourish to those times.

257
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That is studied.

258
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The other thing I can come in on,

259
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
there was no alcohol available anywhere.

260
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Not in town.

261
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I think there was something like a two-mile rule.

262
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
There would be no retail outlet for alcohol

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
within two miles of the campus.

264
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And that prevailed until

265
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
rather late in the history of the institution.

266
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What you see along on our own street now is a lot of places

267
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
where you can get beer and other things in the students

268
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
or clearly enjoying their Fridays like today

269
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
at the Brew Station, for example.

270
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But on those days you couldn't get it.

271
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
In fact, Oregon,

272
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I forgot in what the date of the overturning of prohibition was,

273
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but alcohol was slow to come to Oregon.

274
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In the sense that, first of all,

275
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
you could only buy it in the green front.

276
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You couldn't buy it in a restaurant.

277
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But you could bring your bottle in a restaurant

278
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and they would charge you a corkage fee

279
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and serve you.

280
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But that's a long time for that to be overturned.

281
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So there's one incident that I can tell you about

282
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that I mentioned it before, but it was really quite remarkable.

283
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think it was in the winter of 1941.

284
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I think it was before Pearl Harbor.

285
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
When we had a tremendous ice storm,

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't know whether you heard about this ice storm,

287
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but what happened was we had a freezing rain.

288
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And this was on the night of one of the old school dances,

289
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
which were held by the way in the Memorial Union Ballroom.

290
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The size of the institution when I first in the fall,

291
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
maximum size was, I remember, 4,200 students.

292
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So the MU Ballroom could generally contain all the people

293
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
that wanted to go to a formal dance.

294
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
A lot of people couldn't afford going, so they didn't.

295
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Well anyway, in the MU on this particular occasion,

296
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
there was an ice storm that began early in the evening

297
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and people began to show up.

298
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And as the evening drew on,

299
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the rain which had continued

300
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
began to develop into a freezing rain.

301
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And the trees began to be branches began covered with ice.

302
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
All the power lines were covered with ice.

303
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And as the dance went on, all of a sudden,

304
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
the maybe 839 o'clock, the lights went out.

305
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And what had happened, of course,

306
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
is that the power lines were down because of the weight of the ice

307
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and so on.

308
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Well, this is an all-school dance and it was dark.

309
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You see, no lights in the MU Ballroom.

310
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So somebody scrounced up the candles

311
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and put them around the edge or some other form of light.

312
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But the MU lounge, which is very much the same as it is now,

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
is a place where, in these dances,

314
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
couples would repair, to rest a while and sit,

315
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
smooch with each other.

316
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And when the lights went out,

317
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
she could imagine the glee that that was greeted with,

318
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
well, then after a show,

319
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I happened to be up in the lounge at the time,

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
with my girlfriend at the time.

321
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And the lights went out and,

322
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and, due course,

323
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
there came one of the shopper-alls.

324
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Usually a wife of a faculty member,

325
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
she came in with a large candle opera.

326
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
With lighted candles,

327
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and she put it on a big table in the middle of the room.

328
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then she turned around and she walked,

329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and she walked back to the down the stairway down into the ballroom.

330
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She got to the head of the stairs and disappeared.

331
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
One of the students there got up,

332
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
walked over to the candle,

333
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and all the candles out to the great chairs.

334
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And a few minutes,

335
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the same woman came back,

336
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and she lit the candles again.

337
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And she turned around and walked away,

338
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
but she didn't get to the head of the stairs this time before the student,

339
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
maybe the same one went up and blew them out again.

340
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Again, to great chairs,

341
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this time she never returned.

342
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And turned out,

343
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the lights were out as a consequence of that storm

344
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
for the best part of a week.

345
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And that was devastating,

346
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
it was extremely hard for my mother,

347
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
because we cooked on an electric stove.

348
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And we had all these students there,

349
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
four of them plus my sister and myself.

350
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So she prepared the meals

351
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
as best she could using pots and pans

352
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and so on in the fireplace.

353
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We had a fireplace fortunate,

354
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and she could build a fire and do that.

355
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So essentially we camp for a week,

356
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
remarkable experience,

357
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
well,

358
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
as far as the campus was concerned,

359
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
the consequences of that ice storm

360
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
were devastating.

361
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The campus in front of the MU at the time

362
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
was covered in large numbers

363
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
of a large number of trees,

364
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
beautiful trees.

365
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Perhaps many of them Elm trees,

366
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't know.

367
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The ice storm actually broke the branches

368
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
off of these trees to the point

369
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
where it looked like a tornado

370
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and hit that section of the campus.

371
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You could walk through it in the daytime

372
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and it was still freezing.

373
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You could still see the ice,

374
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
branches lying everywhere on their trees

375
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
effectively denuded

376
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
of their branches.

377
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Well, I led to the removal of most of the trees

378
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
in front of the Memorial Union.

379
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I suppose it was true

380
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that this is only campus also.

381
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't remember that,

382
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but I certainly remember the MU before

383
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and after remarkable thing.

384
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So,

385
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that's more or less the way

386
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
social life would say,

387
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
well, football, of course.

388
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
There were a couple of other things.

389
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Football was mostly for the students

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and a lot of them went.

391
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But you weren't allowed to come with a girlfriend.

392
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The men and women sat apart.

393
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And if you walked in with a girlfriend,

394
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
there would be a raucous cheer

395
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
from the men's section,

396
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and they would shout the word

397
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Fusser, which was a...

398
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and that term was a sort of a epithet.

399
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There used to be

400
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
a director called the Fusser's Guide here,

401
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and that was for people to look up the addresses

402
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and film numbers and other students.

403
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And there were...

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
some of the townspeople went to,

405
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but the stadium would only hold a couple of thousand,

406
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I think, maybe three thousand people

407
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and just one grandstand along one side.

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There's an install bleachers,

409
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't remember that.

410
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But there were also organized on the campus

411
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
four times a year,

412
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
it may have been six,

413
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but certainly four,

414
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
what were called

415
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Lycia,

416
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Lycia in the singular.

417
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And these were events

418
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that comprised visiting artists of one kind

419
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
or another,

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
who often music.

421
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And the...

422
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I have heard

423
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Harker Rubenstein play the piano here

424
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
for Oregon State at one of these.

425
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I've heard Paul Robson sing

426
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and a number of other people

427
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
like the really famous artists that would come.

428
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And that was paid for,

429
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know how,

430
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but home of university resources

431
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
because your student card admitted to these.

432
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And they were held

433
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
in the old men's gymnasium

434
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
if I remember this correctly.

435
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And with a small student body,

436
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you always had enough space.

437
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The...

438
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I was going to...

439
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I lost the thought of what I was thinking about

440
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
these Lycia,

441
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but they were looked forward to

442
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
my a lot of people

443
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and they, you know,

444
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oregon State students were

445
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
largely rural students.

446
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Agriculture was the biggest college

447
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
on the campus

448
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
or school

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and it was called.

450
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I guess this is regarded as an opportunity

451
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
to expose them at least

452
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
to a kind of a cultural side of life.

453
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But they were quite remarkable events

454
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and I was enthralled.

455
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I didn't...

456
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There's no history of music in my family

457
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but I thought these were marvelous events.

458
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So that was essentially

459
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
the way the campus was set up.

460
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It was...

461
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The old...

462
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I was going to say the basketball games

463
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
were also played in the men's gym.

464
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And the basketball schedule was different than

465
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
what it is now.

466
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We have always called the Northern Division

467
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and the Southern Division

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and the Champions of these two

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and meet for the Champions Coast Championship.

470
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's see athletics sort of things there.

471
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So what else can I tell you about the times?

472
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Well, I'm interested also in

473
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
what your academic experience was as an undergraduate.

474
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh.

475
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well.

476
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
After Southern Oregon

477
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
normal school

478
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
it was quite a change.

479
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Now that...

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The normal school is of course as you know

481
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
where teachers college is.

482
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And so there was no major in science at all

483
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and I just had elementary chemistry

484
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
by taught by a well-meaning lady

485
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
that really didn't know very much.

486
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
A couple years later one of my friends told me

487
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that his brother was there on the same class as I was.

488
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And this brother told my friend

489
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that I knew more of the chemistry

490
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
than the teacher did.

491
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know whether that's true.

492
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But at any rate

493
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
that gives you kind of a level of instruction there.

494
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Well, when I came to us you

495
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
that was a different matter entirely.

496
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And the first thing I took here

497
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
was a course in analytical chemistry.

498
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I was dismayed at my first grade

499
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
in an exam in that course

500
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
because by my Southern Oregon normal

501
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
standards it was a very difficult exam.

502
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I didn't do very well on that.

503
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I got to see or something like that.

504
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But I wasn't used to that.

505
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I learned what I had to do

506
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
to work hard.

507
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I ended up with a B in that first term

508
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
for which I was very grateful.

509
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And generally speaking,

510
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I did very well here

511
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
after that initial shock.

512
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And there was a lot of interaction

513
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
between faculty and students

514
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
because the classes were much smaller.

515
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It was a good experience.

516
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And I enjoyed it a lot.

517
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Of course the war broke out

518
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and I say I spent a year here

519
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
since I was in science.

520
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I was deferred so I graduated.

521
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And the campus was pervaded

522
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
by a sense of what was going to be happening

523
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,000
to almost everybody men on the campus.

524
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So a lot of the students

525
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
chose paths that would take them

526
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
into the military offices training.

527
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That sort of thing.

528
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
ROTC was required at that point.

529
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm sorry I have to cough.

530
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I have this just allergy

531
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
that comes this time of the year.

532
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's just about finishes my recollection

533
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
of my undergraduate days here.

534
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Well as I say I played tennis

535
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and we played Oregon,

536
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
again Washington State, Washington, Idaho,

537
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and to get to these places.

538
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We traveled by car.

539
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And usually that was the car of our tennis coaches,

540
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
a guy named Bill McCallop who also played football here

541
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and was on the faculty as a football coach

542
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
of some category or another.

543
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So we drove, get to Idaho.

544
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We drove a car.

545
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You see, and then of course,

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
read a range to play Washington State at the same time.

547
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So that was a long trip.

548
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And by President standards,

549
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
a kind of uncomfortable car.

550
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But we were young and there was lots of fun.

551
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We're all at your chemistry classes in Gilbert Hall

552
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
or you didn't have classes in the age of chemistry.

553
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
All chemistry classes at that time were in Gilbert Hall.

554
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There was a building down on Jefferson

555
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and what is now 15th Street.

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That used to be called a chem shock.

557
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Len is pulling, of course,

558
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
met his wife in the chem shock.

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And I've often walked him around the campus

560
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
on one time when we were walking down there.

561
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
He wanted to go into the building and we went up.

562
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And we went on to the floor and he went into one of the rooms there.

563
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And I can't remember whether the configuration was different from what he remembered, of course.

564
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But he was able with reasonable certainty to identify the room

565
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
in which he was teaching when he met Eva Helen.

566
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And he told me a couple of amusing incidents about the chem shock

567
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
in those days.

568
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What did he say?

569
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What did he say about the chem shock?

570
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Well, there was one famous incident.

571
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And you see, we didn't, I guess,

572
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
he didn't have natural gas as we did later on as when I was there.

573
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And so when you had a burner in the laboratory,

574
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
this was generally burning gas, perhaps so subtly.

575
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I think it was in a steel tank.

576
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And that was mixed with oxygen and other Jason's tank.

577
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And these were admitted into the laboratory by hoses.

578
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And there was a guy there, an assistant of some kind,

579
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and pulling told me his name, but it was a foreign name,

580
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
an Indian name or something like that.

581
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
A student who was working there and being paid to do certain things.

582
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And he managed to get these lines connected up in the wrong order.

583
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
In such a way that when he turned on the tap,

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
the higher pressure in the oxygen tank forced its way through the tube

585
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
into the acetylene tank outside.

586
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Well, the consequence of this ultimately for reasons

587
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
of the aeronics plane was an enormous explosion.

588
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And fire that destroyed the stock room and much of the,

589
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that section of what was called the chem shock.

590
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And pulling said he never knew what happened to this student.

591
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
He wasn't hurt.

592
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Nobody was hurt.

593
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It turns out.

594
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But pulling didn't know whether he had managed to get his degree or not.

595
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That much he was able to tell me a while.

596
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
When I had read the chem shock, had a reputation for getting in the fire.

597
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Had a reputation for getting in the fire?

598
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Did it?

599
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I don't know.

600
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, this was certainly one.

601
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And you can see why.

602
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I thought was the method of firing up burners.

603
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Chemistry nowadays has done in much more batches,

604
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
usually in the undergraduate labs and it was then.

605
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I mean, if you made a preparation, then you made a pound of it.

606
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm exaggerating.

607
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But I mean, you had a lot of stuff there.

608
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Nowadays, it's all green chemistry.

609
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Very small amounts of things.

610
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And the summertime, I worked once on the,

611
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think I don't remember whether I worked two summers or just one summer

612
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and another vacation period on the campus as a part of the.

613
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, surveying crew.

614
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And one of the guys who stayed with us and my mother's operated.

615
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Rimming house was a guy who was a civil engineer.

616
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And had a standing summer job.

617
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And he ran this line of levels.

618
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And so he taught me how to hold across things.

619
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And so on taught me what the signals were and so on.

620
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And that was better than working in the hot orchards in.

621
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So they're Oregon.

622
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
But I didn't earn a lot more money out.

623
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And I can say that.

624
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I know the stalker I'm job that.

625
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You signed up.

626
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
There were a number that was all student operated.

627
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, there was a head of the stalker.

628
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
A man named Stony Wells.

629
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I remember that still.

630
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
One of the reasons I remember it because I mentioned that name to my father.

631
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And he said, Stony Wells, I know him.

632
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So I brought him around one time.

633
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And they shook hands and reminisced for a while.

634
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I don't remember what the connection was.

635
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But the students were the ones that actually did the legwork.

636
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And taking in glassware, handing it out.

637
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And those days you checked it out.

638
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You had a pad.

639
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And you filled out what it was you wanted.

640
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And handed that to a guy behind a window,

641
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
just like other shelves someplace.

642
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And he would go get the items and give them to you.

643
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And then there was a return sheet.

644
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And when he returned it, the items had to be clean and dry.

645
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You put them back.

646
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Looked at the sheet, made sure everything was there.

647
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Put them back and then matched it up with the checkout sheet

648
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and threw the two away.

649
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So things were borrowed and returned from the stalker.

650
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And we who did this work behind the window.

651
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Or what we were being paid for by NRA.

652
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And YAA, National Youth Administration.

653
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The first year I got 25 cents an hour in the second year.

654
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I got a raise to 30 cents an hour.

655
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But that was big, big money in those days.

656
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You could buy a Coca-Cola for a nickel.

657
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And you could go to a movie or something like 25 cents.

658
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And a full plate lunch would cost you 35 or 40 cents.

659
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Something like that.

660
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I remember my childhood, and hopefully on my father,

661
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and my mother was away.

662
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And my father and I went out to a local rooming house.

663
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It was called a finished boarding house in Hokewim.

664
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And they would serve meals to people.

665
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It came in.

666
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It was family style.

667
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
A big long table.

668
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
A bunch of silent guys sitting there and spooning it in.

669
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And the cost of that for the two of us was something for each of us.

670
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Something like 20 cents a piece.

671
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Just a bag of tell about today's standards.

672
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Unbelievable.

673
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Were there any classes or teachers that made a big impact on you?

674
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh, yes. There were.

675
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:19,000
JP Maelig was a very long-term faculty member here.

676
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
He was an analytical chemist.

677
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The first man that I really met on the faculty,

678
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
because that's the first course I had to enroll in here.

679
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
He lived to be over 100 years old.

680
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And he was a man of incredible precision.

681
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Everything he did, his whole analytical chemist,

682
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
seems to fit his personality.

683
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Because he did everything by the clock and by rules.

684
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
People used to say, JP Maelig always walked to work.

685
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And he lived down on eight streets or something like that.

686
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And he would walk up Jefferson to the chem shack.

687
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And I was told, I don't think the story is apocryphal,

688
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
but maybe the, I mean, people used to stand and wait for

689
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Maelig to walk through the gates.

690
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And they said you could almost literally such a watch by his coming in.

691
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Well, I had a little, he got his degree at Purdue.

692
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And he never ceased to be very interested in what Purdue was doing.

693
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And he subscribed all his life to the student daily newspaper.

694
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He used to go back there for the summers to do research.

695
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And he drove his car.

696
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And every year he changed, he bought two new tires.

697
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Either for the front or the back and older not years.

698
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And those days tires in land nearly is, in the last nearly as long.

699
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And then the work came along.

700
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They couldn't get tires and he was terribly upset.

701
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It turned his life around on an uncomfortable way

702
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because he was so used to buying these tires.

703
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There was another man later, made a great impression on me.

704
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And that was a man named James W. Ferguson.

705
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
He was an organic chemist.

706
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And as a war broke out, of course, he left.

707
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And he went back and worked for the Midwest for Eli Lilly Company.

708
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
But anyway, his high-learned and enormous amount of organic chemistry

709
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
from him, he didn't do a lot of research.

710
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But he was certainly a support teacher from my point of view.

711
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Another person, of course, was Bert Christensen,

712
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
who became department chairman after I returned to the faculty.

713
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
He was remarkable in a way because as a faculty member,

714
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
because it was very hard to do research here at the time.

715
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Federal grants didn't exist down.

716
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The kind of structure we have now, like National Science Foundation, didn't exist.

717
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So you had to do everything more or less on your own,

718
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and you got very little contribution if any from the state.

719
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But he managed to involve himself and research both with graduate students

720
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and undergraduates.

721
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And I worked for him for a year or so,

722
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and a very interesting project that we finally published.

723
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And that was my first publication with Bert Christensen.

724
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
There was another guy named Bill Caldwell.

725
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I never had his a teacher, but he was a very popular instructor of freshman chemistry.

726
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I had very fancy demonstrations that the kids liked a lot.

727
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And then of course, there was E.C. Gilbert, who was a physical chemist.

728
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I grew to know all these people as a student,

729
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
but of course, when I came back in the faculty,

730
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
all alone, once I mentioned it, except Ferguson, or still here.

731
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Ferguson, after he went back to Eli Lilly,

732
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
he returned to Oregon and he went to Portland State,

733
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
where he finished his career there.

734
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And after I came back in the faculty here,

735
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I saw him a few times in Portland.

736
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
He looked just the same.

737
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So those, of course, I knew other faculty members too,

738
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
but I didn't have them in any of the coursework that I took.

739
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So there's a project that you did with Bert Christensen.

740
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That was your first experience of scientific research.

741
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Well, it was called, are you asking, what kind of work it was?

742
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yes, and that was your first research project.

743
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, well, it was called a micro-determination of hydroxyl group.

744
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And it was an analytical technique where you worked with very small amounts of sample using

745
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
hydrobalances, sealed them up, and then a reaction took place.

746
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And then we could analyze the mixture and we could determine one aspect of the composition of a molecule.

747
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Later on, when I worked at Shell Development Company, I learned that our analytical method

748
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
was being used in that commercial analytical lab.

749
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So that was really pleasing to me that they were big time down there.

750
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So by the time you were done with an OSU, and you decided that you wanted to be an academic?

751
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
No, the war was on them.

752
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And I was faced with a decision about what I was going to do.

753
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And I had two opportunities.

754
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The war work was going on in the chemical industry.

755
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And in particular, there were people from Shell Development Company who came around,

756
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and they were looking for people who recommended by the faculty to do war work on some of their projects.

757
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
The other opportunity, and I was interviewed by them and offered a job.

758
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,000
The other opportunity was to go into the Air Force in a program that would have been,

759
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:33,000
for me, and meteorology, or an armament, not in flying, because at the time, my visual acuity wasn't very good.

760
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And so I had been registered with a draft board, and I went to see Gilbert.

761
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And Gilbert, he was a nice guy, I liked him a lot.

762
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But he kind of grumbled, or, you know, he would talk in a little voice.

763
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
He said, I think it's ridiculous for you to go into the Air Force.

764
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And not use your chemical training when you could do that.

765
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
In war work, for they need skilled people.

766
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And so then I went down to my draft board, and I talked to the chairman of a draft board.

767
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And I think his name was Cindy McCollum, or something like that.

768
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I thought he was clearly a scot.

769
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And he ran a gas station down town.

770
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I explained this situation to him.

771
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And you said, young man, you better go in the Air Force, or we're going to draft you.

772
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Well, this calls me to think a little bit about this.

773
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And at that point, I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, you see.

774
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
To make a long story short, I finally decided that I would take the job at Shell Development Company,

775
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
which was a professionally extraordinarily valuable experience.

776
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But in terms of emotional contentment, it certainly wasn't very relaxing.

777
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
First of all, I spent most of the war on one A, which is the draft status eligible for a draft.

778
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And you never know whether you're going to be drafted.

779
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And well, I guess I shouldn't have said it that way.

780
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
When you're in one A, you're eligible to be drafted, and will be drafted.

781
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So, I was always classified one A by the draft board.

782
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
The company appealed to the appeal board at Oregon on grounds, and I was doing war work and supplied the paper.

783
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
There are a vacation of this, and because of the secretive and important nature of this war work,

784
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I was always reclassified in different stages of to be.

785
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Now, this deferred status lasted for only six months, dated from the time that you were first classified one A.

786
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Well, it took about three months for this process to go on, and for you to be reclassified to be, but by that time you only had three months left.

787
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So, I spent literally half of the entire war years in one A while the process of keeping me deferred to do this war work went on.

788
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And it's more than just paperwork, because before you're classified one A, you get a notice on the draft board that says greetings.

789
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And then you have to appear for a physical.

790
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Well, they would tell you when you first of all, I had to appear at fifth and one rule for a physical.

791
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, I can't do that. I mean, we're engaged in war work down here.

792
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
We'll transfer your physical down there all this took time, you see.

793
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So, then I would take the physical, or I would go down.

794
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'd be transported to San Francisco after the procedure.

795
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And there are a whole bunch of potential draftes were lined up, and we went through a physical, it took at least.

796
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, it took all morning, and the most of the afternoon.

797
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
A which time?

798
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You either classified as physically capable or classified four F, which means incapable of military service.

799
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So, at the end of this, I was classified one A. My draft board was notified, and they told me I was one A.

800
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Then the company would get the papers, and they would appeal this, and we would go through the whole thing again.

801
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I did that about five times, I think, during the war.

802
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And on one occasion, just before the war was ending both in the Pacific, both in the European theatre,

803
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:36,000
was in 1945, and I had an emergency appendectomy, and those days an emergency appendectomy was a big deal.

804
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I was in the hospital in Oakland for over a week, bedridden. They didn't allow you to get up or anything.

805
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I had a huge scar like this long there.

806
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So anyway, in the middle of all this, my notice to appear for a physical part.

807
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But I knew that if you had a recent serious operation, and that was serious in those days, you're automatically deferred for six months.

808
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So, I tried to tell them that I'd add a recent appendectomy, so take your physical.

809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So, I lined up down in Oakland, and we didn't do course or transport it across the bay with a hundred other guys.

810
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You see, I'm told a strip there, and I said to the courseman, and the first courseman, I said,

811
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I said, I've had a recent appendectomy, and I said, I'm supposed to be deferred for six. He says, get in line.

812
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I got in line. I came to the next courseman, I said the same thing to him, he said, get in line.

813
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Went through all the tests and so on and passed them all, and came to the last guy who was an officer there, and there's a guy who was supposed to test for their mentally fifties as psychologists.

814
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And he looked me up and down and said, you had a recent appendectomy, and I said, yes, I've been trying to tell him that all day long. He grabs my papers and he writes deferred.

815
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And lastly, the war ended, there was still going to be occupation forces, and the war ended, of course, in the Pacific and August of 1945.

816
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And a lot of the military were being decommissioned and sent home and so on.

817
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And then the year were rolled around and the question was, who were they going to have in the occupation forces?

818
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And at this point, of course, there was no further need of my services than this war work, and so I was eligible for this.

819
01:02:44,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But on the second of February in 1946, I turned 26, and they didn't take anybody over 25.

820
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So then I was automatically out of the occupation draft group, and then I entered Caltech in the spring of that year, left Sheldon Elementary Company.

821
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Well, there were several things. The Japanese, of course, had succeeded in overrunning all of the plantation that provided latex for natural rubber, which is of course really needed during the war.

822
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And so synthetic rubber had been discovered, and there were all sorts of ways of making synthetic rubber. So I worked a lot on the problem of synthetic rubber.

823
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Another thing that developed about this time during the war was the discovery of the efficacy of penicillin, which is being produced in a traditional way.

824
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:26,000
In our area, by cutter laboratories, it existed in either in Emoryville or in Berkeley or Oakland, right down there close to the bay. They had huge vats, and they cultivated this and separated the penicillin, which was distributed to the armed forces, was not available to civilians at all.

825
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:34,000
At this time, and I worked on the extraction, the methods for extracting penicillin from this.

826
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The third thing that I did was that was probably the most interesting, in many ways, was an aviation gasoline inhibitor.

827
01:04:46,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Now, aviation gasoline, in that time, was hundred octane fuel, because all the aircraft were propeller driven, and there was a high performance engines that required that level of anonaut quality.

828
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:17,000
This was particularly during the North African campaign, and these tanks of hundred octane fuel were shipped across, and then they had to stand in the desert.

829
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Now, one thing that happens to gasoline is that over time, they tend to form some gum, which settles out to the bottom.

830
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Now, that gum, if it gets into the engines, of course, can be a very serious matter.

831
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So, they apply what are called inhibitors to delay or greatly slow down the formation of this gum.

832
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And the stockpiles of fuel there in North Africa had in them a die, a red die.

833
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It turned out that when the gum was formed, this red die would be a clue to take down the fuel with changed color.

834
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So, the sergeants running the dump would realize what it was going on, and they would then use this deteriorated fuel and jeeps, and then motor vehicles of various kinds.

835
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, of course, it's obvious that what you want to do is to prevent this from happening as long as possible, because that's expensive fuel to be using in jeeps.

836
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Then it turns out that a lot of the time that the stuff was gone, the die was disappearing, the fuel was still good.

837
01:06:42,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, we had a special inhibitor that was better than anything in use that we were developing and testing in the desert with a drum, that we have mounted on the demahave desert at an army base with a bunch of thermocouples all through it, because we needed to figure out, we needed to figure out how quickly the gum formed,

838
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:23,000
in accordance with weather conditions. I mean, if you store these drums I mentioned in North Africa and the winter there's no problem it's cold, and in the summer it goes to pot very quickly.

839
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Well, how do you know that because you don't know what the temperature inside the fuel is, because in the summer a barrel at the bottom might be relatively cool and one at the top would be totally gone.

840
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:58,000
We had a way, we put these thermocouples all through this test drum, and then we could measure the rate of formation of gum as a function of, well, we took these temperature data from the thermocouples all through the drum and worked that up into something that we could call an effective temperature for the whole drum.

841
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And we could predict from a thermocouple in any place what the effective temperature was in the whole drum.

842
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And that would tell us how long that fuel could be expected to last, and so we did that in addition to developing and testing our inhibitor which turned out to be very good.

843
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Well, the war ended before the inhibitor could actually be used, and then of course the fuel now is not under octane anymore, so that never got into production, but if the war gone on much longer it would have been.

844
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That's the kind of thing that I did, and all of this laboratory work was of tremendous aid to me when I entered graduate school because I know how to use my hands, I've been doing it for three years in the laboratory.

845
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
This job was in Southern California.

846
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah, Caltech.

847
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, is that Caltech?

848
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I went to Caltech.

849
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh, the shell was it, it was an Emoryville.

850
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It was called shell development.

851
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Emoryville is a small on-play between Berkeley and Oklahoma on the Bay.

852
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Well, we're at about an hour and 10 minutes.

853
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Do you want to keep going or do you want to?

854
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Well, I can go a longer.

855
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I probably should leave here about quarter to twelve, and if you want to.

856
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Okay.

857
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Or we can do whatever you like.

858
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're left, if I'd like to keep going.

859
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So, you finished up at shell, and then you went to Caltech.

860
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
How did, what was the process by which that happened?

861
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
How did you mind at the Caltech?

862
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Well, the laboratory work,

863
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and it's shell.

864
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I should say just a little bit more about that.

865
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Was a small laboratory.

866
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You know, a shell development.

867
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
There were all sorts of projects distributed all over.

868
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
There was a motor lab out and back, in which gasoline's were tested.

869
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I was in the research end, and there were,

870
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
where the head of my small laboratory,

871
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and another guy who had been working there for a long time,

872
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and I was brought in as a third guy to help these people.

873
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
We became all three of us, very close friends,

874
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and as social as well as in a professional sense.

875
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The man who, who headed as a name,

876
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Daniel B. Luther Jr.

877
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And he was a remarkable person.

878
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
He was a very good scientist.

879
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And at the same time, when the war was over, during the war,

880
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
he got very interested, partly because of this North African stuff.

881
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
In climate, and thereby associated himself with geography.

882
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So he knew a great deal about geography all over the world,

883
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and especially about climate changes in temperature and so on.

884
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And he used to amuse us by coming up with some facts that you know that you didn't know.

885
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:38,000
He said, where do you think the rainyest July in the world is?

886
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Where is the place where the rainyest July takes place?

887
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well, right away, you think monsoon or something.

888
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It turns out there is some village called Charapunji India,

889
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and India, and he said in the monsoon season,

890
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:04,000
he announced to us that it had something like 240 inches of rain in the month of July.

891
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
These are the kind of facts that he would come up with.

892
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Well, the reason I mentioned all this is that after the war was over,

893
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
he retired from shell as a chemist,

894
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
but became so knowledgeable in this other area

895
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and he was appointed an adjunct professor of geography at Cal.

896
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And as time went on, he built quite a reputation in that field.

897
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
He came to Oregon State, gave lectures here, was invited up on the geography department.

898
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
He was a very, very interesting guy.

899
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
The other fellow is Joseph's interesting.

900
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
His name was Aldo, the Benedictus, and he was an Italian, obviously.

901
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
He came from an Italian family.

902
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He was engaged to the head of business and making pasta.

903
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And one time he told me, he says, don't let him kid you.

904
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
He says the dough is all the same.

905
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It's just the die that makes the difference between pasta.

906
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So the texture is different depending on the die, but not the dough.

907
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Well, Benny graduated from Cal.

908
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
He was an excellent student, but he had a family of several children,

909
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and he had to go to work.

910
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But not having a doctor's degree, he was not running the lab, you see.

911
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But Dan Luton treated him in every way as an equal.

912
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
He had his own projects and everything.

913
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Well, he spoke Italian fluently.

914
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And Shell had a occasion to want somebody that knew Italian very well

915
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
to serve as a translator and so on.

916
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And after the war, he moved out of chemistry into marketing for Shell,

917
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
where his language skills could be useful and he moved to New York.

918
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, he did very well in the company.

919
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:11,000
He moved up the ranks, finally when he retired officially from that aspect of Shell,

920
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
they moved back to Berkeley, he and his wife and family.

921
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Guess his kids were grown and they lived there at the time.

922
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then he told me he became very wealthy after he retired.

923
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And he told me how this happened.

924
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:47,000
There is a company knowing as...

925
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm thinking advanced micro-devices.

926
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's not that one.

927
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's another one that makes chips.

928
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It's the biggest chip maker in the world now.

929
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Chips for computers and so on.

930
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Pardon?

931
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No, no.

932
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
No, they make...

933
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Well, I'm sorry, I'm a spoke.

934
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I think they make the devices for making chips.

935
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
But he told me, many told me, we told him, many.

936
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That he was approached by some people about this project.

937
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And he said about five or six of them sat down

938
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:35,000
around the kitchen table in his house in Berkeley.

939
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And he decided he... they all put up $10,000.

940
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And that company just grew like wildfire

941
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and he ended a multi-millionaire just by just thinking that money.

942
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And so he endowed a chair at Berkeley in chemistry,

943
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
called the All of the Benedictus Chair of Chemistry.

944
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
His wife went to UCLA and was an nutritionist.

945
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And he set up a similar thing in her name at UCLA

946
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
with another million dollars.

947
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So this was done years ago.

948
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It must be worth a lot more than that now.

949
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So I thought that was quite a remarkable story for a guy

950
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
who spent his youth making pasta and working

951
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
in a chemistry laboratory to end up like that.

952
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay, so Caltech, what decided me to go there?

953
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Well, I was thinking about going there

954
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
and I wrote that you see Gilbert and he said, well,

955
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
you have to.

956
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You said, you know, there's a very good university right there

957
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
where you're working.

958
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's the University of California.

959
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
For some reason, I wasn't interested in going to Cal.

960
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I don't know why.

961
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
But it's a tremendous institution.

962
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Of course, some great people there.

963
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But maybe I don't know nothing about that area for the while.

964
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And so I applied to Harvard and to Caltech.

965
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And in due course, I was admitted to both of these as a student

966
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and then I had to make a decision.

967
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And so I talked to Dan Looton about all of this and he said, well,

968
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I said, Caltech has got Linus Pauling.

969
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Who else do they have on the staff?

970
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And I knew a lot of people that Harvard, you know,

971
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
are very famous people.

972
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But the only one I knew at Caltech was Linus Pauling.

973
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And Looton with his customary bruskin since a human manner

974
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
he says, look, he says, with Linus Pauling,

975
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
they don't need anybody else.

976
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
That was his famous line to me.

977
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And I've never forgotten that well.

978
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That wasn't enough to decide me.

979
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But what did decide me was that it was only a short distance away.

980
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It was on the West Coast and a place which at that time

981
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
was reputed to be beautiful as indeed it was.

982
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And I had a small beat up car that I knew wouldn't make it

983
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
across the United States.

984
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And so I packed this thing up with my dogs, my wife and myself,

985
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and we started out for Caltech.

986
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And I'll tell you this, too.

987
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
This is more a personal history than it is a professional history.

988
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I guess maybe.

989
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That's all right.

990
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Well, this was a 1933 Chevrolet coupe.

991
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And it had been repaired once.

992
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And I started out.

993
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:59,000
We had it loaded my wife and myself and we started up a steep hill

994
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
out in the valley just before you get into Southern California.

995
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And the car began to falter.

996
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And then it wouldn't go any more.

997
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
But then if I stopped it, fired up the engine,

998
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
it would catch and I could go a short distance and go,

999
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it would stop.

1000
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Just as if it were tired, you see.

1001
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
So then I turned the thing around and managed to get over to the other land.

1002
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I wasn't a freeway on those days.

1003
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And I went down at the bottom of the hill.

1004
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The car ran just fine.

1005
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Pulled it up into a gas station, which was closed for the evening.

1006
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And it had mechanic.

1007
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I saw seated with it.

1008
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And so I pulled into this gas station.

1009
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
There was a light on in the house and back.

1010
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And I asked about mechanic.

1011
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I came to the door and said, well, line on mechanic.

1012
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And I said, well, I hate to bother.

1013
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I guess you're closed.

1014
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
This is what your problem.

1015
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I explained this to him.

1016
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And he put down his knife and fork.

1017
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You're literally having dinner.

1018
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And he went out and he listened to this and looked.

1019
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He says, you need to know a fuel pump.

1020
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
He says, I don't have one here.

1021
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But I think I know where I can get one.

1022
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And so I said, gee, that's very kind to you.

1023
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And he said, no, no, that's okay.

1024
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And he gets in his car and he goes away.

1025
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
He's a team and later.

1026
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So he appears and he's got the fuel pump.

1027
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And then he gets to work on my car and puts the new fuel pump in.

1028
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And those days it was a fairly simple job.

1029
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Put the new fuel pump in.

1030
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
We fired it up and he says, there.

1031
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Now I want to do it.

1032
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And I said, how much do I owe you?

1033
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
He says, well, he says, you pay me for the fuel pump.

1034
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I said, I got to give you more than that.

1035
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
He says, no, no.

1036
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I says, sometimes you just have to help a guy out.

1037
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
That is a lesson.

1038
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
You know, that happened when I was 26 years old.

1039
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I have never forgotten about.

1040
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And to my last angry grat, I never learned the guy's name or the location of this.

1041
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
But I have never forgotten that.

1042
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Absolutely remarkable.

1043
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
You know, I spent a lot of time.

1044
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And he wanted nothing for his time.

1045
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So I didn't know that you were married at this point.

1046
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah.

1047
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
But that was my first wife.

1048
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
We divorced some years later.

1049
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And my second wife was met a Norway.

1050
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And we've been married for 55, 56 years of something.

1051
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Anyway, they get back to Teltaq.

1052
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So I don't know where the hill got down.

1053
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I found a place by then-wife relative.

1054
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:59,000
They were offered to put us up for the night to not her husband was a postman in Pasadena.

1055
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And he, on his realms, happened new quite a bit about vacancies and so on, which were very, very few.

1056
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And in that time, in that area, there were a lot of houses that had garden colleges and back to them.

1057
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And he knew about one of these.

1058
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And I went up to my wife and I went up interview these people.

1059
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
There were old people, 80 years old or so.

1060
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And nobody was in the house.

1061
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And they had fixed it all up.

1062
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
They were very particular about their tenants.

1063
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And after I just, we turned on the charm, but they agreed finally to run it to us.

1064
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And we were then able to wheel up our few belongings and put them in the house, which was furnished.

1065
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And we lived there for quite a long time.

1066
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
When I went to Teltaq, I presented myself at the main office.

1067
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And I set up on appointments.

1068
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Mrs. Wolf, Beatrice Wolf, who was his secretary.

1069
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
She said, well, Dr. Pauling likes to talk to all the new graduate students.

1070
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I'll set up on appointment for you.

1071
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And she did.

1072
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I can't remember whether I got an office right away or not.

1073
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But then you might do remember the interview with Pauling.

1074
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
He knew that I was from Oregon and from Oregon State.

1075
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And of course, there was a kind of a bomb there because he had gone to.

1076
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I mean, not a bomb, but at least there was something in common.

1077
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And so he asked me, well, I was interested in it.

1078
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I told him I was interested in chemical kinetics and mechanisms and so on.

1079
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And he said, well, he said, it's too bad because the right person for you to work with would have been Roscoe Dickinson.

1080
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But he died last year of cancer and we haven't anyone to take his place yet.

1081
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But he said, we do have a young postdoctoral fellow here from back east.

1082
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And he's interested in this kind of work and doing a project.

1083
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And it would be fine for you to work with him if you would like to.

1084
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And he would like to have you.

1085
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And to this day, my mind is boggled at that because you can't imagine our department chairman here.

1086
01:24:48,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Suggesting that any of the incoming graduate students that work with a postdoc and not with a faculty member is hands are very hard to come by and research program.

1087
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So I went to see this man whose name was Seaguardner Swain, who later went on to a distinguished career at MIT as an organic chemist.

1088
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And I worked a full year for him until his period was over.

1089
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And we did a project, a project of his, it turned out just fine.

1090
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And we published a paper on it together.

1091
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:50,000
It was a, it was the oxidation of a lucho malachite green to malachite green carbonyl was an organic compound, which then decomposed or, yes, to form a die called malachite green.

1092
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And we could study the reaction by watching the color formation of this stuff.

1093
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So it was a fine project and it was good for me because it was good for Gardner because I had all this laboratory experience during the war.

1094
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Probably had more than he had at that time in the actual laboratory work.

1095
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But he was a very clever guy and if we wanted to do a reaction at Shell Development Company, we had all the equipment on the shelf there.

1096
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I could bring down a, what was called a thermostat, a constant temperature bath.

1097
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I could put up the control mechanism called, and put in the controlling thermometer and the heaters and so on.

1098
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I would have it all set up in 15 or 20 minutes.

1099
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
At Shell Tech, they didn't have any such thing.

1100
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So Gardner sat down, he was good at electronics and he drew out some components, so he would need.

1101
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And I went up to the avenue to an electronics store and bought these things, came back and spent, I don't know, how long.

1102
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:14,000
A couple of weeks or three, maybe even more than that, to the taking courses, building is relay that would work, building it, putting it together, soldering wires and so on.

1103
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And then I spent another week locating and getting transported a big tank, which I could fill with water,

1104
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
sold our samples.

1105
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I set up the heater and put everything in it and got it going.

1106
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
It took me the best part of six months versus that 20 minutes I mentioned.

1107
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Once it was set up, reactions, experiments when rather nicely and conveniently fast.

1108
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
That got done and Gardner's year there.

1109
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
That was a good experience, so at the end of that time, I had to decide I was looking ahead.

1110
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
What else I was going to do?

1111
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And there was a young guy there, he's only about six years older than I was.

1112
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
That had a very, very, very good scientist.

1113
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
He'd done his work with Pauling and banana to the faculty.

1114
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And he had a group of young people who were kind of eager, and I went to talk to him.

1115
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And the help showed of that conversation as I decided to work with him.

1116
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And we had a project that we settled on right there.

1117
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So Gardner left.

1118
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I began to work with this man whose name was Werner Schumacher.

1119
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So maybe we should talk about some of this at a later time.

1120
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
So I can do that.

1121
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Well, I can do is send you, and eat well.

1122
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Why don't you send me an email suggesting sometimes?

1123
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Because I think I can fit more easily than you.

1124
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Now next week, I'm going to be in Ashland.

1125
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Going Tuesday and won't be back to the weekend.

1126
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Is that okay?

1127
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The week following that, we can do.

1128
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Let's see.

1129
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
We're looking into October now, Tros.

1130
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
No, we're not.

1131
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
After the Ashland week, I'm free.

1132
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Every day except Thursday when the president is hosting a marriages faculty.

1133
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
That'll luncheon.

1134
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday are all available.

1135
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Okay.

1136
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And the next week is entirely free.

1137
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That's the week beginning the 26th.

1138
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:09,000
We do it Thursday and then the week after the week.

1139
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Okay.

1140
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Okay.
