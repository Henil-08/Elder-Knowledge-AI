1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Okay, so we are recording now, and it was like last time, really, really, just a state of

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,000
name and a date date.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Yeah, my name is Kenneth Hedberg, and what else you want?

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,280
A date date.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
A date today?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,120
Oh, and this is September 20, 2011.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,680
So we last thought, last time you had just made the switch over to there, and she made

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,980
her, and that he was starting to research with him, and I wanted to think, well, this

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:41,960
is about how that happened, how he meant to make her, and, yeah, this is that Celtic.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,920
I can't remember, although I mentioned that I spent a year working with Garden of Swain.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
I think I did that, yeah.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:57,680
Well, at the end of that time, I interviewed Werner Schumerker, who might pass them all several

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,040
times in the other group of people, he was young, not far from my age, so I went to see

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
him.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
We hit it off.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,960
Well, I decided I would do my future work with him, and I began almost immediately,

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:24,880
and we decided we would look at a number of boron compounds that we were able to, we

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,920
didn't make them ourselves, we got them from a guy at USC, who is named, I can't remember

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,960
now, distinguished in Jordan, I can't list today, right?

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Every began with Diaboraine, which we measured, and we're able to show conclusively that

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:57,020
it was a non-ethane like structure, it had two iterations up above and below the boron

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,840
boron bond, and the well-known bridge structure.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:13,680
After that, we took up a number of other boron compounds, including, before H10, B5H9, B5H11,

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,200
and some substituted Diaboraine with clined and bromine atoms, all of them, and also amino

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,800
groups, amino Diaboraine, we studied, all of these took place in the next few years,

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,760
I think some of them overlap, I was still working when some of them after I got my degree

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:57,520
when I continued, so that was a exciting time, and excuse me, I finished my degree in June

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,080
of 1948, and I was offered a post-doctoral position, oh, that came about an interesting

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:20,160
way, Paul and came around one time in spring of 1947, that was only, or maybe it was a

31
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:30,560
fall of 1947, I don't have been there for at most 18 months, and he said, I think you

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,400
should write up your work for a degree, and I said, well, I was hoping I would be able

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,440
to take another year, and work that year with Professor Badger, who is a distinguished

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:56,320
spectroscopist, Paul and said to me, well, he says, you write up your thesis and did a

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,320
degree, and I'll say that you get a fellowship, so you can spend an extra year working

36
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:09,280
with Dick Badger, and then you said, you know, you'll make a lot more money, have to

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,560
get your degree, then you would before you get your degree, so why not, you're studying

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,040
doesn't stop at the time you get your degree, so the logic of this is impeccable, and

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:31,640
I said about writing up my work for my thesis, and I'm sorry about this throat, I have

40
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:43,760
the same problem last time, so I finished writing up my thesis, now the troublesome aspect

41
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,720
of this is that my supervisor, Werner Schemaker, was off on the Guggenheim Fellowship,

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:58,800
and Denmark, and so the person that nominally oversaw my research was Robert Kory.

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,120
Robert Kory, of course, he unpolling published a series of seven papers, and ultimately

44
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,600
led to polling, winning them Nobel Prize, or his alpha helix, and other things as well.

45
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,520
Anyway, Bob Kory didn't know anything about the lecture on the fraction, but he was a very

46
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:27,320
nice, friendly man, and he helped me over some crucial points, so I'm having a lot of trouble

47
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:36,600
writing this thesis, getting it all right, he says, well, he says, tell me what it is,

48
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,840
you're struggling with, and so I told him he says, why don't you write it down?

49
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,960
So I wrote down what I had been telling him, and then it's a little bit, and I don't

50
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
me over at home.

51
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,120
Anyway, I finally finished my thesis and took my examination.

52
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,080
Polling was not present in Werner, it was not present either, having a still being in Denmark,

53
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:14,640
so excuse me.

54
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,680
After I got my degree, I continued to work for a while until on the projects that I had

55
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,760
been working until Werner returned Denmark, and then I was sure enough I've got my degree

56
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:39,200
polling returned, and I received notice that I had been awarded an A noise fellowship,

57
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,480
which enabled me to spend a year working with Richard Badger, which I did, and I learned

58
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,120
some spectroscopy in that year, but on the side, I continued my work in electron diffraction

59
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,400
as well, but that was a very nice year.

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:08,240
At the end of my fellowship year, I was appointed a research fellow at Caltech, and I worked

61
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,760
on a grant that Werner Schumacher had with the Office of Naval Research.

62
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,280
At that time, the Office of Naval Research was sponsoring basic research, and I didn't

63
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,600
have to have much to do with the Navy as far as I could make up, but so I worked on that

64
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:41,360
for a couple of years, and then in 1951, I think it was polling said to me, oh, maybe I should

65
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,920
go back to step. During this year, a number of people showed up at Caltech from abroad, mostly

66
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,560
postdoctoral people who were anxious to work, either with polling or some other

67
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:08,160
dignitary, and water too, with Werner Schumacher, and I became quite friendly with a number

68
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,400
of these people, including a guy from Norway, in the Altobustelnson.

69
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm getting just a little ahead of the story there, but because I decided after I'd had a

70
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,040
couple of years that I should have a postdoctoral fellowship, maybe abroad or something like that,

71
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,640
so I decided that I would continue my work in spectroscopy, and so I filled out an application

72
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:43,920
for a full bright fellowship to Belgium. There was a band there with whom I wanted to work,

73
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,640
and so I filled this thing out, sent it all off, and got back a notice and due course a few

74
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:59,600
months later, something unfortunately. My application had been received too late to be considered

75
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,200
in that year's batch of full bright fellows, but they urged me to apply again for the following year.

76
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Well, in the following year, my friend Altobustelnson, later friend, Altobustelnson showed up from Norway,

77
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,600
and he was a specialist in electro and defraction, and I had no name not personally, but through

78
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:37,280
publications, and we hit it off, we became very friendly, my wife and myself, and him and his wife,

79
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:46,960
and he had two small daughters, and so we worked together at Caltech for a while, and then as a year

80
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,480
of due to a close, he said, why don't you apply again for a full bright and apply this time to go to Norway,

81
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,920
instead of to Belgium? I said, well, that sounds to me, like it might be worthwhile,

82
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,800
maybe I'll do that. About the same time, Pauling walked into my office one day and said to me,

83
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,080
I think you should apply for a cooking high and fellowship. This is how he didn't say,

84
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,760
would you like to? He said, I think you should do this.

85
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,080
Well, Pauling carried such an oral within that when he made it suggesting, you almost always follow through,

86
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:38,560
and decide that was a prestigious fellowship, and so I thought I'd go up and said, okay, well I'll do that,

87
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:48,080
so I wrote out an application form, which was essentially the same proposal for research

88
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:56,480
that I had written to the full bright program, and I sent this off, and I waited around a while,

89
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
working away with my her, not knowing what was going to happen, the meantime,

90
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:10,000
Paul's Johnson went back to Norway, and in due course, I got a letter from the full bright people,

91
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,480
saying that I had been awarded a full bright research fellowship to go to Norway,

92
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,840
and this paid all my living expenses and paid my transportation back and forth.

93
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,680
And then about that same time, maybe a little later, Pauling walked into my office and said to me,

94
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:42,240
well, are you getting ready to go to Norway? He didn't know anything about my having received

95
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,720
the full bright fellowship, and I said, well, I didn't know I was going, and I think I may have the

96
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,320
chronology inverted here a little bit. I think maybe he came in before I received notice of the

97
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,560
full bright fellowship, that makes a little more sense, and I said, I didn't know I was going,

98
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,880
he said, well, the selection committee generally follows my recommendations, and he turned and walked out.

99
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,720
That's all, that was a total conversation we had on the issue. And a bit later,

100
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,320
I got a letter from the good and high in people, saying I had been awarded a good and high

101
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,320
fellowship to go to Norway, and it was $3,500. Well, now, and then the full bright notice occurred,

102
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:35,760
and then I had gone from where I had no support, where I had two rather well-indowed fellowships

103
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,200
for the same period, so I thought, well, you know, I have to let them know. So I wrote off to the

104
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Guggenheim people, said, I'd also been awarded a full bright fellowship research fellowship. They said,

105
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,280
the Guggenheim money was given to me irrespective of whatever other words or money I had.

106
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,160
Well, I thought pretty good about that, so well, of course, I set the same letter to the

107
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:06,800
whole light people, and they wrote back after a while, and said, we normally subtract

108
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:16,640
money from additional grants from the full bright grant, but that, the amount of money that you have

109
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,000
from the other source should be enough to support you for the full period of your time before we

110
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,800
will take any action on this. And they said, we have determined that the $3,500, this is in

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:39,840
1940, 1952, that went a long way then, that $3,500 is not enough to support you in Norway for

112
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,440
a full 12 months, so we will not subtract it from them after we give you for the full bright grant.

113
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:55,920
Well, a full bright grant was a equivalent of a little more money than that, actually. I can't

114
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:06,400
remember what it was in Croner. I think it was $4,200 a month, and there were seven Croner to

115
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,560
a dollar then, so that was about $600 a month, so that might have been $75,000. I don't know,

116
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:21,920
$10,000 bucks in those days are big bucks. Well, at this time, my first life decided that she met

117
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,200
somebody she preferred to me, and so she let me, and I had all this money, and it was going to go

118
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:40,160
to Norway with as a single person. So, so I booked passage on Mauritania and I traveled across the

119
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,760
country, visited a couple of laboratories, I went to Oak Ridge and visited some friends there,

120
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,200
went on to New York, sent my luggage on ahead, and due course I embarked on the Mauritania,

121
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,040
which took me to Southampton, and I spent a few days in England, and then I sent sail again

122
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:13,360
on another ship to Norway, and when I arrived there, this was an origin ship liner. I was

123
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,440
met up the pair by my friend, Altaboste, and some of the number of other people that I had met there.

124
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,800
I didn't mention that I had been to Norway once before, after I had met Boste Johnson, I went to an

125
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,960
international meeting in Stockholm, and on the way back, I stopped, so by and shadowed it in a

126
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,840
little bit about what we were going to do, and we had a big party. That was a fine party.

127
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,120
I can still remember it. I don't know whether I should go into the details,

128
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:59,040
but anyway, that was a great party, and so he and the friends, his friends and collaborators,

129
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,960
on the laboratory met me at the boat, and they had been looking for a place for me to live.

130
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:20,080
This is Norway in 1950, the October of 1952, first of October, and it was after the war,

131
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,680
and Norway had really begun to recover very much then. So they told me that they had found

132
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,680
an apartment, and they were ashamed to say it was terribly expensive, but they thought it might

133
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:46,400
suit me pretty well, because it was very close to shopping. I had a, let me call it a district anyway,

134
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,480
called my Ustuit, and I had a fine apartment there, and it was owned by an English woman who had

135
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,480
been separated or divorced from her husband, and she had gotten this apartment. She was going back

136
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,600
to England, where she came from originally, and was going to rent it out for a year or so. And it

137
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:15,040
cost my friends told me that some of much over price was $150,000, and $50,000 a month. That's $20.

138
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Now $150,000, remember my first check was $4,200, and that paid my rent for the entire month.

139
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:36,640
And so anyway, I moved into this place, which was furnished. It had a kind of a couch for a bed,

140
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,680
but it was perfectly satisfactory, and had a kitchen, a bathroom all about kind of a studio arrangement,

141
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,360
where then walking, it's easy walking this and so the university up on the hill.

142
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:59,440
So I lived there, and I had determined before I left, and I was going to learn the language.

143
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,760
And my friends, Bosteonson, had been talking to the cultural attache at the embassy,

144
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,760
and to the people in charge of the Fulbrightrogram, and they had managed to find me a set of records

145
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,880
called, and those that no longer exist, and I think, extent, they're called Linguofone records,

146
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,720
and they got me, and they were 78s, and they got me old record player. A friend had one of those,

147
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
and so I could play these records on them, and they could hear their sounds. Along with these records,

148
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,200
came a book in this book out of picture on it, and it had the text that was spoken.

149
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,320
So the idea was that you put the record on, and the first lesson, of course, was almost

150
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,960
obvious, the words were, once that you could translate from English, you know, so very slowly,

151
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,480
the words were spoken on this page, and you could see the picture of what it was describing on the

152
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:15,440
facing page, and so I would look at this, and the spoken word would come to you,

153
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,960
and then the pause, and you were supposed to repeat after this, mimicking the accent,

154
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:30,720
but tonality as closely as you could. And so this, I later came to admire these records very much,

155
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,600
because at this same time, you saw the written language, you heard it spoken, and you had to speak it,

156
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,920
and there was no translation except in the picture. And believe it or not, this happened in

157
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,880
52, I can still recite lesson 1, 2, 3, almost by heart, because after you had gone through this thing,

158
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:01,440
there was another section where they were asked to question, relating to this, and you had to

159
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,680
had to respond to that. You see, it was quite remarkable, and an example of this, the first sentence,

160
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:20,320
was describing the picture, is decked out for media, Hansen. Now you can almost, let's say,

161
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,000
what that Norwegian is a language, which has almost the same word order as English.

162
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,920
That the odd means this is, and this is the family Hansen in this picture. And then I saw

163
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:44,560
best of all, sit there, E in, Lien is the grandfather is sitting in a walking chair.

164
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
And you could see that if you're not, the bottom is as best of all, so it's grandfather,

165
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,840
so you look in the picture, and there's an old man, you know, in the beard, and he's sitting,

166
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,920
sitting, you know, that right away, in E and in Lien, a story, or the other in the school is chair,

167
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,320
and Lien, it means rock or take. Anyway, that's just an example. And I went through every day,

168
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,640
I came back from the university, I would sit down, I would study, it's amazing. These things only

169
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,000
played for three minutes if you played them through. It took me an hour to an hour and a half to get through,

170
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,840
a single lesson doing everything they want to me to do. And in the morning, I went to the

171
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,560
university, and I would, my friends, you know, they knew I was doing this, and I could recite the whole

172
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:42,560
lesson to them, which caused proxism of laughter. One of my friends said, the guy, there were several

173
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,840
voices, as a lesson went on. The first was a man who had a, he was an origin, but he was

174
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,760
rector of the university at that time. And my friends swore, they could hear his voice speaking,

175
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,880
spoke to them, I didn't mimic this accent. Well, anyhow, when I first went up to the laboratory,

176
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,680
to meet Paul Stelinson in the work environment, and we talked, we knew what we were going to do.

177
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,440
He introduced me to his laboratory assistant, whose name was Lisa Smith-Eck,

178
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,320
and he said, she's only been working with the three months, but I think you two should work together

179
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,640
well, because I have administrative duties I'm occupied with also. So we engaged in this project

180
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,240
and Lisa and I worked on it together. Well, when I was introduced to her, I was ever so impressed,

181
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,320
because, of course, I was introduced in English on the first day or two, and she spoke to me in

182
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,080
English, and we had a conversation, and I later answered, well, have you spent any time in,

183
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
what did you learn your English? It's one I learned at school, I said, to have an

184
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,760
ship in the England of the States. Oh, no, no, she says I've never been in an English-speaking country.

185
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,920
It impressed me so much, and this is true to all these people, you know, you walk in, they've been

186
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,440
never been out of the country, they can talk to you in your language, which of us can do that here,

187
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:20,000
you know, it's almost impossible. Anyway, we worked together, and for two or three days, and then

188
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400
I very interested in music, and they also fill him out a play-down town,

189
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:40,800
and I got on the tram one time, went down the town. Oh, I think, oh, in the first few days I was there,

190
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,800
I decided I needed to have my own car. There were very few cars and also at that time.

191
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,080
My history today is one of the busiest places in town. I mean, it's bumper to bumper getting

192
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,040
into the, when I lived there, it was rarely a car, and they were all pre-war things. The country was

193
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:11,040
so destitute, of so devoid of money, that cars were very, very hard to come by, but anyway,

194
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,760
I could buy a car. There were agencies there, but I had to pay for it in foreign currency,

195
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,320
and I had to agree to sell it. I mean, I had to agree to export the car.

196
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,280
At, it had a special license plate on it, in the case, I had a Q number on it, which means

197
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,960
owned by a foreigner, and then she didn't pay tax. So the upside of all this was sort of a solder car,

198
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,800
in the country at the end, tax would have to be paid on it, but that stage. Anyway, I bought this car.

199
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,040
So I drove a downtown, in order with somebody here a few weeks later, and

200
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,760
and as I walked in, they stood, they said, picking up our ticket as I was picking up mine.

201
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,720
So we sat together, enjoyed the symphony, and afterward I asked her, she'd like to have a

202
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:16,240
after concert snack. And so we went to a restaurant of famous place called Blooms that is still there,

203
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,600
and we had a big cheese spread and had a good time together. We again date regularly.

204
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:32,240
And the episode of all that was, so after my year there, I went back to the states,

205
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:42,320
and there was a reason I were thinking of getting married, and I wasn't quite ready to commit,

206
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,240
because I hadn't quite recovered from my first marriage. But at any rate, I got back to the states,

207
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,920
and then I proposed to her, and I came back to following somewhere, which is 54,

208
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:04,880
and we were married in Oslo. And that, say, 54, I guess, has now been married 57 years,

209
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:13,120
and so anyhow, that was a romantic outcome. And I got, I've often speculated about this later,

210
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,360
suppose that full-bright application that I had applied for at a Holland to Belgium had been

211
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,160
successful. My life would have been quite different from what it is now. So it's such things

212
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:42,640
the fate turns on. How do you mean marrying a fair foreigner? Her mother had died a couple of years

213
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,360
before I arrived. She had a sister, and a father, a father, worked in a bank,

214
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:59,440
a personal manager of a bank, and she had an off the sister of her mother that lived upstairs

215
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:12,240
in the apartment building. My wife's family is going back to generations as a distinguished one.

216
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:24,480
They came from Denmark, and my wife's great-grandfather was the foreign minister of Denmark.

217
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,560
And he and his one of his siblings founded essentially the New York Times of Denmark,

218
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,000
it's called Pulla Ticken. And so the family had an interest in that newspaper.

219
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,400
One of the other brothers was the distinguished newspaper, my name is Critic.

220
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,800
The name is well-known. It's called Brandis Edvard Brandis. You can find books written about the

221
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,040
Brandis family in Denmark. Well, that was her great-grandfather and great-grandfather. Great-grandfather.

222
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,680
So anyway, these are the mother stemmed from this group,

223
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,000
has did her aunt upstairs who became kind of a surrogate mother to her as after her own mother died.

224
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:37,200
So we came back at least as father. I enjoyed him a lot. He was very taciturn. Some Norwegians don't

225
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,480
say very much, but I think he was pleased that I could speak to him in his language. He could

226
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,600
speak a few words in some words of English, but he wasn't as comfortable in it.

227
00:28:50,560 --> 00:29:03,680
So we hit it off very well. And at least it's out too. She was a patrician type person.

228
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:12,640
He had beautiful furniture and paintings and so on. And her husband was a distinguished Norwegian

229
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:25,520
scholar and so on. Very well-peed. And this family, Lisa's aunt, Uncle, and her cousin to whom she

230
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,880
is still very close. You see them go out often. They have a lot of fancy stuff. They have paintings

231
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:43,120
by to lose her track and they have monk originals, Edward Monk, watercolors, and rippocrats,

232
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,920
and so on in their house. That was just something on the wall when I would, I would put him

233
00:29:49,920 --> 00:30:03,280
in the press by a lot. So after we were married, I, no, we married in the city hall in Norway.

234
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,800
You haven't been in Norway, had you? No, well, they have a absolutely beautiful city hall.

235
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:21,760
And it's got marvelous paintings around huge murals on the wall that depict the

236
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,840
developing and evolution of the Norwegian nation. And outside, they have some carved huge

237
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,680
carved wooden figures from north-most north mythology. Wooden is there on his eight-legged horse with

238
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,240
two ravens ahead. All in wood, you can see up there. So, no, we were married. These had

239
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:52,080
arranged the license before I arrived and we were married in this office. It was a civil wedding.

240
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:04,400
I'm not sure, but I think as far as I know, a lot of the Norwegian weddings have done in that

241
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:13,920
fashion, at least, of the generation that Lisa stems from. So after we were married, we

242
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:21,440
fussed around a while because we had to get a visa for her. And that's a story which is

243
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:33,280
irreplace me still. So we apply for a visa down at the embassy. And the embassy is very worried

244
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,120
that there are foreigners that want to marry an American citizen simply to get into the country.

245
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,080
And you have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops and time went on one week, turn to two, turn

246
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:57,360
into three, and so on. And no word, no word at all. And so I finally wrote to a friend of mine that

247
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,800
I had met at Caltech and then was working a scientist working in Washington and I explained the

248
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:10,080
situation to him and he pulled some strings and discovered that the application was sitting on a

249
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,120
desk someplace in a pile of papers and they were working through and they would get to it. So

250
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,840
I virtually blew my top of this because here I am sitting in Oslo and not getting paid because I'm

251
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:34,400
not working waiting for some secretary to clear my application for Lisa. So I wrote to my congressman

252
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:43,680
in Pasadena. And he wrote back on the other dismissal, dismissal letter saying we have to make absolutely

253
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:51,120
certain that these marriages are not marriages of convenience. And you can imagine how I felt about

254
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:00,400
he was a conservative Republican, appropriately turned me into a Democrat forever. But anyhow,

255
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,600
eventually we got a visa, we got on the plane, flew to Washington, spent a night there

256
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:19,120
and went on the Pasadena. And my wife was very tired at this time and discouraged and one, you know,

257
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,480
Norway had beautiful atmospheric conditions. You could breathe deeply in the sky was clear

258
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,080
and we landed in a heavy, small time in LA and she later said she felt like getting right back

259
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:43,040
on the next plane and going home without experience. But so we stayed there and I went back to work

260
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:54,160
at Caltech as a senior research fellow now and I'll continue until I learned about the job at

261
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:19,200
Oregon State. Now, shall I go on to that? No, it was Dick Badger. I did a lecture on the

262
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,800
fraction, which you make, or which is a different technique. Some people call it electrons,

263
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:38,880
but it's not. I'm sorry. It's a separate discipline, but it's similar to the crystallography

264
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,760
in the sense that you measure a diffraction pattern. The diffraction patterns are very,

265
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,960
very different because I'm looking at molecules on the gas and x-ray diffraction looks at molecules

266
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,920
and it is in a crystal or at least in a condensed phase. How would you classify your discipline

267
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,880
well, how do you mean classified? It's a technique for studying the sizes and shapes of individual

268
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:22,800
molecules. A physical chemistry with infrastructure chemistry. Oh, I see. Well, when I was a

269
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Caltech, as I say, I started doing organic reaction mechanisms for a year, then I did electron

270
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:42,800
diffraction. And in the course of this, I did some crystal structure, a crystal structure with

271
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:51,600
two other people and then I did spectroscopy with Dick Badger, so I had four different experiences

272
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:58,640
there. Now, this is a little unusual because at this institution, it's rare that a student works

273
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,400
from more than one person, of course, of getting his or her degree. Usually, you pick a supervisor

274
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,120
and you work on his projects and what up at thesis in your out of here. But I worked and in my thesis,

275
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,600
the Badger work, of course, I was a post-altural fellow at that time. But in the course of

276
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,600
getting my degree, I did three things that all of these things were written up in my thesis in

277
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:34,240
different sections. That's a little unusual. Probably a little unusual for Caltech, too, in that

278
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:42,240
people often do two different things, but three with three different people is quite different.

279
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,320
I don't know whether I mentioned that that crystal structure was very interesting. It had to do

280
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:59,760
with a compound called arcenyl benzene, which has a formula with, I can describe verbally,

281
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,760
as two benzene rings and two arsenic atoms. It was generally thought that the benzene rings

282
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,080
are hooked to the arsenic atoms and two arsenic atoms are joined together by a double bond

283
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,880
as we say in the language. But it was pretty well understood at that time that arsenic doesn't

284
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,320
like the form double bonds, very, very readily. And particularly with a compound like this,

285
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,280
where there's no opportunity, for example, in no oxygen, surround the form, no balloons.

286
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,200
So it was widely thought to be a dimer, the one I described just two units hooked together.

287
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,560
But we suspect that that wasn't true. And so when we looked at it, we found that there actually

288
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:55,120
was a six-member ring of arsenic atoms with these benzene rings flopping off. One off of each

289
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:06,480
arsenic atom. So it was a hexamer relay and a very nice molecule. The interesting thing about this

290
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,800
is many years later, I got a photocopy on our large photocopy, which I still have.

291
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:24,960
This was before a year old, became the official currency of Europe. I have a 200 mark German

292
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,160
bank note. Now 200 marks was a big bucks in those days. And on it, it's a picture

293
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,600
of a man who is responsible for discovering the first arsenic holes in use for treating

294
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:50,000
cyplos in particular. Well, one of the arsenic holes used was, I gather was our senomancing

295
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,640
because on this bank note, our paper is actually cited with the three authors and the

296
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:07,520
date, which happens to be wrong, but at any rate, it's on the face of the bank note.

297
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:17,360
I thought that was once upon it. So anyway, that's what I did at Caltech.

298
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,920
And I call myself a structure chemist. So the thing that led me into electron diffraction was

299
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:34,400
that to realize this was 50 odd years ago now. It was kind of a cutting edge technology.

300
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:45,360
It was the best way everything considered of determining the sizes and shapes and motions

301
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,280
of individual molecules that are unaffected by the presence of others.

302
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,680
A crystal structure across the molecules that will pack together.

303
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:05,680
And the other technique that works also on the same phase is micro-inspiracroscopy.

304
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,240
But in order for micro-inspiracroscopy to succeed, it has to molecule, it has to have a dipole moment,

305
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,240
and a lot of them don't. Our senomancing, for example, would not have. So you can't study a lot of things,

306
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,440
but we can study anything we can get into the gas phase, select on the fraction. So

307
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,320
I decided I would continue with that work, because I like what I was doing with Schumaker at Caltech,

308
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,600
and that's what got me started.

309
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,320
So you mentioned Schumaker and Korean, and it's just been knowing a little bit more about what they were

310
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,720
like, because there's now either like to do something about it socially.

311
00:40:48,720 --> 00:41:03,840
Well, I can tell you, well Schumaker, in my way of thinking he was a brilliant scientist,

312
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,960
but not aggressive in the sense that he pushed like a lot of people do.

313
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:23,440
You know, in science, it is always enough to have talent. You have to be a salesman as well.

314
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,880
And people like Linus Pauling, he is a tremendous salesman, because he had a personality

315
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,160
that took him the whole room, so he had a sense of humor in his lectures,

316
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,600
were very, very heavily attended. People come from miles around to hear him, and I've heard him

317
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:55,520
lecture to packed halls in several foreign countries. There are other people who are distinguished

318
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,800
also, but have a very tiring personality. And some of these are one noble prizes, you know,

319
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:11,760
but they don't have the public acclaim that a person like Pauling does, or augment the

320
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,200
way on those from Caltech. And these guys sell themselves, and they're other people too.

321
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:30,160
So Schumaker was a brilliant scientist and a very critical thinker.

322
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:38,960
He was amazing in that respect. He was so highly regarded that Pauling used to come down and

323
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,080
bounce his ideas off of Schumaker. He would come into the office and talk to Schumaker and say,

324
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:53,440
verner, what do you think of this? And he would describe something. And other people, the

325
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:04,000
organic chemists from the third floor of Caltech, names are getting harder for me to come

326
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,720
by quickly would come down, talk to him about there is problems they had. And he was like a

327
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,320
bulldog. He couldn't let go of a problem. He would analyze it, turn it around, upside down, and if

328
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,480
this, that, et cetera, these people were sitting and listening very carefully to him. So that's

329
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:34,880
a kind of guy I was. He also, we went hiking and I see our backpacking together. We became

330
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,240
close personal friends, as well as my, me being a student. So we did hikes in the high sea areas

331
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:51,520
on a couple of occasions. I used to go every summer for any one to two weeks backpacking

332
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,280
in the high sea area. So we would do that. And he was eager and interested in that.

333
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,720
There are a host of interesting events, but you see I'm not quite sure how much of this

334
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:21,360
I should go into, but let me talk about Torrey. Torrey was a, he was a very nice man and he

335
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,760
helped me a great deal when Schumacher wasn't there in that last year when I was riding up my

336
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:42,720
faces. And he was a Chris Logifer and I don't remember the detail, so I won't try to recite them,

337
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,680
but I've read them. You can get them the archives, Celtic archives, tell all about polling,

338
00:44:49,680 --> 00:45:01,280
so encountering Torrey and inviting him to come to Celtic. So then he, he suffered from some

339
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:11,360
kind of a nervous disorder. It was not Parkinson's, in that he had some ticks that would cause

340
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:21,280
his whole arm to move a little bit. And when he walked, he walked sometimes with a little bit

341
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,920
of motion. I'm not quite sure what it was, but that was not evident in a speech when you talked

342
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,840
to him. And when he was sitting down, you didn't see any Parkinson's like motion at all from him.

343
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,240
But he would come to see me and I could see him in a time I wanted. He was responsible for a very large

344
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,720
excuse me, laboratory. He was headed up by a guy who is making compounds of the sort that

345
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,800
polling was interesting and that played a role ultimately in his formulation of the alpha helix.

346
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:16,720
So I don't know much more about him than just that, but to this day I'm very grateful for

347
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:26,800
what he did for me in the time of chimpanzees. Yes, Dan was a very nice guy too,

348
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:36,720
any other very nice wife. I knew Dan Campbell quite well because there was a very free

349
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,600
social order at Celtic. All kinds of parties with the students, postdocs, and the faculty,

350
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,320
you have a student party, you know, and everybody would be invited and Dick Badger would show up

351
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:55,600
with his wife and Dan and his wife would show up and others as well. Polling didn't come to these

352
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:03,680
parties far as I know. I don't remember ever seeing him there, but I do remember a number of them

353
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,920
in which people from physics can Dick Feynman showed up in a number of these. I've heard Feynman play

354
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:20,240
his bundle drums that these bodies. So Campbell was a nice guy. He had a medical problem which

355
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:29,120
was sold, he had colon cancer and lay removed the large tumor from his colon. But I don't think

356
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,400
he ever suffered a recurrence of that. He was what was called an immuno chemist and that was

357
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,760
something the polling was interested in at the time and you know chemistry. So does that answer

358
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,640
your question about what I knew about Campbell? Do you ever manage in speed rather than hearing?

359
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes, but only in passing. Roger Hayward of course was illustrating polling books for

360
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:07,440
him. And he had a number of beautiful figures and various books, but only in passing. I just

361
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,120
met him. I never had a chance to talk with him. Do you? Yes.

362
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Yeah, I guess you told me that last time. I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about Jack

363
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:29,840
and then the person in also why is he important in my sight? Oh, well, I didn't talk about

364
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:40,080
Jack before, did I? No. Jack was became a very, I just to this day, a very good friend of mine.

365
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:52,640
He has showed up after getting his degree at in Scotland with Jam Robertson and he came to Caltech

366
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,920
and in the British system, you know, when you study for a PhD, you do your undergraduate work,

367
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,480
you study for a PhD. But my understanding is you don't do much coursework from that point on.

368
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:14,160
So, Jack attended lectures at Caltech. You see on subjects that he had an interest in that

369
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:22,480
he had not been exposed to before. But we worked together a little bit, we published a paper

370
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:35,520
to together and Jack has absolutely incredible sense of humor and he could do, I don't know,

371
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,440
he's not a pushy guy. It's kind of a laid-back lie sense of humor, you know, but he's not a

372
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:48,080
retiring individual at all. He's a very social guy. He's just not a pushy social guy.

373
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:56,400
So, he came to Caltech and he was working on crystallography on electron defraction and

374
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,480
then he was joined by, I won't say he was joined, but another guy came named Leslie Ordle.

375
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:13,600
And Jack and Leslie became very good friends. Leslie died recently, but he was a distinguished

376
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:21,360
scientist. He was a theoretical chemist to begin with, but began turned to

377
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,880
molecular biology later on and went to the salt institute and had a distinguished career there.

378
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Jack, when Pauling one is Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 54, we had a huge big, and then we put together

379
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:56,320
let's call it a review in the vault of Elfona thing where there are lots of skits and songs and

380
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:05,200
there was a talented fellow named Ted Harold also from Britain who could write music and

381
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:13,040
played the piano and he composed a lot of stuff. And among other things that were composed for little

382
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:24,160
acts or a participant would do a kind of monologue and Jack was involved in one of these.

383
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,320
It's a famous one. The whole thing has been recorded and you probably have a copies of it here.

384
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:39,520
It's called a road to Stockholm. In there there is something where one of the individuals

385
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:47,360
sitting in his laboratory looking out the window at the young girls going by in front of a cold

386
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:56,320
Bunsen. If you haven't heard that record, it should be put on tape or disc because it's on

387
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:05,760
Shalak and homemade and it tends to deteriorate. So Jack participated in things like that.

388
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:21,040
The young lady came and they began to go together. Her name was Daphne. I don't remember her

389
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,360
her last name. But anyway they became very close and they came engaged to be married.

390
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:38,000
She was a postdoctoral person working in biology and they had met at one of these social occasions. I guess

391
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:49,440
they were together a lot and groups, big parties, all of us were. And then Jack's period

392
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,760
Daphne went home and Jack's period of Celtic ended and he went home and then it turned out

393
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,320
that she had decided against the marriage and broke the engagement.

394
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:11,520
Well, Jack at this time was working with Dorothy Hotskin and Anne Oksford and I was on a trip to Europe

395
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,400
for some meeting or another and I stopped buying visitors with Jack and he told me that there was

396
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:27,200
really a hard thing for him. But it turned out Daphne never married after that. We not quite sure

397
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:37,360
in the reason that they broke up. It's a little obscure but I can say this at least as a rumor.

398
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:49,200
She decided that Jack was Jewish and she was not and this conflict was just conflict apparently

399
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:57,520
with something she decided she couldn't live with. And anyway, a year or two later

400
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:09,920
Jack met another young woman. His present wife, his name is Barbara and he met her in black

401
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:17,760
wells at Oxford. She was where she was. I don't know what her background is but she was working

402
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,480
in the store there and black wells and they hit it off immediately. She's a beautiful girl and they

403
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:34,800
were married and they have I think they have two children. So Jack, at the end of this period

404
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,480
in Britain, you may have a list on record but you want me to tell you what I know about it.

405
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:51,280
His future career was, Dorothy Hodgkin, of course, had worked in the structure of vitamin B12

406
00:54:52,800 --> 00:55:00,160
and had determined its structure and had presented this as a plenary electorate of meeting

407
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,120
from her half of the bill and she got a standing ovation for this and she later won the Nobel Prize for

408
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:17,200
her work. Well, this lecture or other work that she had been doing with organic molecules and

409
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:25,120
pressed the people in the organic, I don't know whether it's a college or a school or whatever

410
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:32,240
division, if they ate it in Zurich and they asked her to recommend somebody who could

411
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:38,480
to be in organic chemistry, who could determine structures and she recommended Jack.

412
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,360
Well, he went there, gave a lecture, showed what he was doing and the

413
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:52,880
upshot of all this, let's say hired him as a faculty member. Well, he's had a distinguished career

414
00:55:52,880 --> 00:56:06,320
there, he's just widened his horizons immensely, became a professor, which in the old German

415
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:17,840
system is about the equivalent of the well-regarded senator in this country. And spinach's

416
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:27,280
entire career in Zurich is now retired, but I think he still has an office although I'm not sure

417
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:37,680
what he's doing. Occasionally, I want to cross them in this country and I write to him occasionally also.

418
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:51,440
So, he is his reputation, grew by leaps and bounds, he's a foreign associate of the National Academy

419
00:56:51,440 --> 00:57:01,280
of Sciences and he gave the Baker lectures at Cornell, let's say in lecture series of polling

420
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:08,480
gave that resulted in this book, the Nature the Chemical Pond. So, Jack's had a wonderful career,

421
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:23,600
he's a very, very nice man. Well, it's a little hard to tell, major discoveries in a scientific sense.

422
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:34,640
He has a lot of distinguished publication record, not an amount, but the sorts of things that he took

423
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:45,840
up and studied thoroughly, basic sciences, very helpful to others. But I don't fall across the

424
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:52,640
log a few very closely, so I can't tell you much about what he has done. I do know that he worked

425
00:57:52,640 --> 00:58:03,280
very hard on the confirmations of rings of various members in the rings. There is elements of

426
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,080
the rings, 5, 6, 7, 8, and my rings, and so on. He's well known for that.

427
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:19,280
I like to talk about calling it for a little bit. It doesn't sound like the, it sounds like you

428
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:30,000
was certainly a person who spent time with others, but it often sounds like it's not the

429
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:40,000
name for a social way. Yes, well, he wasn't anti-social at all. It's just that

430
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:49,760
the kinds of parties that I'm describing that many, but not all, the faculty attended,

431
00:58:50,800 --> 00:59:03,440
like, oh, I'm trying to think, for example, you mentioned Dan Campbell and Dick Badger and Werner

432
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:12,000
and a number of other faculty members, as well as postdocs and graduates, so they'd all

433
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,440
have a big party, you know, everybody was on a first name basis. I never called Badger by anything

434
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,320
other than his first name. Even as a student, that's how he was known. Almost everybody was on

435
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:31,760
a first name basis, except the polling. He was always not to polling. He sort of

436
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,560
carries an oral with him and all the way is friendly enough. You know, you didn't, you only came

437
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:50,720
so far. He always called me by my first name, even on visits around here. I never really

438
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:56,480
called him by his first name, but then he, any comfort at all, because he never invited it.

439
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:08,720
Now, I should tell you something, this is kind of a, doing back to my stay in Norway.

440
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,720
The person who headed up the laboratory on that first one, there was a man named old hustle.

441
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:25,600
He later won the Nobel Prize. Housel was a, is a lawyer, if I tell a little bit about hustle.

442
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:33,040
He was an interesting man in the Norwegian system. They had professorships just like the

443
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,480
German system. He was a professor of physical chemistry and there was a professor of organic chemistry

444
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:52,480
groups. But Housel was unique. He was virtually, I don't know if I could call him an alphabet,

445
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:00,240
oh, but he had very light features, very light hair, and he was very, he had kind of in the

446
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:07,040
stagmas, and he had trouble reading. He never married, and he had a lot of money for the

447
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:18,400
inherited. He was a very good scientist. During the war, he was very aggressive, and he was

448
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:27,440
imprisoned along with a couple of other people, and they were kept in a camp in Oslo. They were

449
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:38,000
now allowed the teach. The university was closed, but in against all regulations in this camp,

450
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,200
Housel organized a series of lectures and studies, so the imprisoned people that are actually

451
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:51,040
learned a lot while they were incarcerated from people who had lecture on topics. You see,

452
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,120
they've been put in the camp with them. So Housel didn't not all under at all, the Germans.

453
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:05,120
Well, in the war ended, and he went back, resumed his position in Oslo,

454
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:14,320
all the people who had been in the camp with him. He used the familiar form of the dress.

455
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,760
At that time, in Norway, there were two words for you, which is due in Z.

456
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,840
For D rather, I'm thinking of German there. So, he was D with,

457
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,080
of the old school. He was D when almost everybody that he didn't know, older people, especially,

458
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:57,920
they always refer to one of his D and them. Anyway, Housel, after I had been there for a year

459
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,880
and come back, I would always make a point at going to see Housel, because he was the professor.

460
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:11,280
He was, in effect, I think, a kind of a lonely man, because he had no family, had a living

461
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:19,120
housekeeper who served him his meals and did everything around. I had a beautiful house.

462
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,080
And one time when I came in, you know, I was always going to see him, and we would shake hands,

463
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,680
and he would immediately go to the board and show me what he was working on.

464
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,960
And then one time, when he was working at the board, and I had said D, and so on, he was saying,

465
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,640
D, he turned to me and he said, this is traditional one, Norway. He said, we have known one another

466
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:51,600
for a long time. I think it is time that we say due to each other. Now, a younger man could never

467
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:59,280
propose that. It had to be the older man. And, of course, I was knowing Housel, if I did,

468
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,640
I was quite honored by this, because here I was a foreigner. I was saying due to him,

469
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,320
where people that have been in his laboratory for years had not been in the camp, or anything,

470
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:17,360
we're still D. And these guys have been around for 20 years. He still said, D, you know.

471
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:28,000
But anyway, I guess I probably hit it off with him, because, of course, I was both Norwegian to it.

472
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,560
And he was so pleased that an American would come and learn Norwegian. See?

473
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:41,440
Anyhow, he invited Lisa and me to dinner at his house on time. We went back to Norway after we

474
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:47,200
were married. I've been there a couple of times on sabotic leaves afterwards. And one of these

475
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,120
guys, he invited us to dinner. We had a magnificent dinner at his house. It was all catered.

476
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:59,440
He had ordered it in from a catering outfit. I think I say F, actually. We're running a catering

477
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,760
outfit. And we had a very pleasant evening at Housel's house.

478
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,640
So, the people that didn't get that email were calling very often.

479
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,880
Pardon? People that didn't get the email were calling there.

480
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,760
Not very often. It's a little hard to tell. I was kind of one way, as I said,

481
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,800
you know, he always shook hands and said, how's Lisa doing? And he would ask me about there

482
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:35,040
also, it's the things he would call me Ken, but I never felt that he relished me calling him

483
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:45,600
Linus. And everybody had that feeling. I know he visited here when Earl Gilbert was chairman

484
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:51,120
alive and Gilbert referred to in his Linus. They talked to one another on that basis.

485
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,160
But I don't think Gilbert had really met him before. I just don't know.

486
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:13,600
Yes. I'll have him talked about that. I'll know. Well, here is a couple of incidents surrounding

487
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:25,280
this woman cool. I was asked by the pawlings with my then first wife to babysit the children while

488
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:36,960
they were off on a trip. The children are Peter, Linda, and Crollen. And they were early, early

489
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:47,120
teens. And Linus had finished and gone up to medical training was often Linus Jr. in a

490
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:58,720
white. And so we weren't required to do anything that kids ought to go to school. And so I'm

491
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:05,040
we're supposed to be there in the evenings. Make sure that they were all there and so on. And so

492
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:13,280
we did that. And they had this swimming pool.

493
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:23,360
The pawlings' house had two wings that came together like this. And people were fond of saying

494
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,280
I'm not sure whether it's true or not, but the angle between the wings was a hundred and nine

495
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,640
degrees and twenty-eight minutes, which is of course the angle of tetrahedral bond angle.

496
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,480
I don't know whether that story is true or not, but it certainly was very close to it.

497
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,000
Well, down in the little below it was the house was built slightly up and down below they had

498
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:54,080
a swimming pool. And the pawling kids, when their parents were away, were on the habit of going

499
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,320
around the chemistry department and inviting everybody up to a big party in a swimming pool.

500
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:07,040
And I remember this happening one time, the pool was full of people in the pawling showed up.

501
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,120
And in a short while, Eva Hillon came out and said, Linda,

502
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,160
your father and I would like to take a swim. And can you get these people out of here?

503
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:26,000
There was a hush that fell over the group and we vacated the premises very quickly.

504
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:38,080
One of the occasions when I was babysitting the kids, I heard a splash.

505
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:45,440
This is late at night and it's 11 o'clock and I've actually gone to bed and a bedroom

506
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:53,680
faced downhill. But I couldn't really see this swimming pool clearly. I think it's also some ripples in it.

507
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,840
And I heard this splash. And I wonder what the hell left was. But anyway, I didn't

508
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:06,880
bother to check and so on. And the next day there was no sign of anything.

509
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:14,880
And on the second day, I also heard this splash in the pool.

510
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,880
And again, I did nothing about it. But in the morning, I got up and I went into the kitchen and

511
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,320
made my breakfast and there was a strange man standing there in the kitchen, making breakfast.

512
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,960
And this was a guy.

513
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:39,200
Again, the name is hard for me to come by. But a long standing friend of the Paulings and Paulings

514
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:46,560
is mentioned by a name from the University of Texas. And I guess they asked him if he'd like to stay there.

515
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,000
Well, pardon me. Yeah, that's right, Jeffers.

516
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,360
So we introduced ourselves to each other. It turned out we've been living in this house.

517
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,200
Both of us for three days. And this was the first time our father crossed. I usually got up early

518
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:11,200
and sold it my then life. She went to work and I went to Caltech. And he was on vacation.

519
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,600
Came up later. So we've been living for three days. It's on the third day that I met this guy

520
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:24,880
in the same house. No, Jeffers, that's right. So that was the swimming pool.

521
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,880
What do you recall about this?

522
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
Elizabeth?

523
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:42,880
Oh, Peter, very, very vivacious. And Lind also. Krelon, let's though he was younger, quite a bit younger.

524
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:50,960
Well, I don't know how much younger, but at any rate, the two older ones.

525
01:10:50,960 --> 01:11:05,360
They were almost unfettered. I mean, they were just in the everything in a good human way.

526
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:15,360
Very vocal both of them. Many years later, I went to Lisa and I went to Europe.

527
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:25,600
Peter at that time had gotten the position of the university of London. I guess it was.

528
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,560
And I called him and he met us in the sports car. By this time he had been pretty heavily

529
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:41,040
into alcohols and big problems. But at any rate, he was enthralled with my wife, Lisa,

530
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:47,040
you know, and boy, he couldn't. He was sideling up to her all the time and giving her all sorts of

531
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:56,480
compliments. You know, she was laughing at him most of the time. Peter had trouble with, I think he

532
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:04,480
had been divorced once. And I don't remember any of the details of his life. I only knew

533
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:18,080
at the end that he was totally incompetent and he had gone to Wales and was living in a small house.

534
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:25,360
I got a phone call from in a couple of times from the AL asking me about certain events

535
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:36,800
and his father's life as a fellow named Herman Branson who had given polling some problems regarding

536
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:43,760
priority and discovery and ideas and so on. Peter had told me, I knew Herman Branson

537
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:51,360
for the liner when they think about this and I didn't.

538
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:07,600
Well, Linda, I don't know a great deal about her life. I'll see what she did. I know

539
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:16,640
she met Bartley and when Bartley was a student at Caltech, polling was very impressed by Bartley.

540
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:23,600
I remember one occasion on a party when I was up there, he was asking Bartley some questions and

541
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:31,440
Bartley was answering them and I guess he was, he decided that he was the guy for his daughter.

542
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:47,600
Again, that's just my reaction about it. But Bartley was a nice guy and of course,

543
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,520
he lived in Pasadena and after we came to Caleralis, we didn't see them very much. But Bartley used to

544
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:02,320
make an annual or buy annual trip up to, as Linda put it, his glacier in Alaska is doing measurements

545
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:08,640
on a glacier flow and so on. And one time they stopped by and they stayed overnight with us and

546
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,720
at a very pleasant evening and Bartley could play the piano quite well and so

547
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:25,280
enjoyed sitting at our piano and playing it during the evenings. Afterward, Linda asked her

548
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:32,960
father for something that she could give to these and me as a token of appreciation and

549
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:45,600
I have a picture of polling together with the whole of the famous South African doctor and

550
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:59,920
after, yeah, I was five six. I was both of them in the picture, not what sent to me, I remember.

551
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:11,840
Well, we fight back on this period in Caltech, it's called the gold name, the Caltech and

552
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,840
the assistant kind of closing it away. That means that this is the gold name in Caltech.

553
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:30,480
Well, I guess it's properly termed because it was, you know, I was asked to give a lecture

554
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:39,360
a banquet talk one time at a meeting, a symposium in Texas and the topics suggested to me

555
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:45,680
was the golden age at Caltech. That was a title when we talked. So I dredged through all the archives

556
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:54,480
and found out quite a lot about various people and things. But the golden age was the age

557
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:06,560
of all this marvelous stuff that polling was doing in chemistry and people like Feynman and others

558
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:19,040
were doing in physics. And it was an environment that couldn't be more exciting to a young student

559
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:28,080
because you could almost literally hear a lecture each week by a Nobel Prize winner and some

560
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:34,960
subject or another visitors. I mean, I've heard lectures from people like Feynman who came from

561
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:46,320
Argon, I've attended lectures by Feynman, Carl Anderson was there, I've heard lectures by him

562
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:56,560
and I've heard lectures by people in chemistry who came through. So all this in the period

563
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:03,760
when I was a student and at the same time we knew there was a very active program in x-ray

564
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,880
crystallography going on. You voted to providing polling. I'm quite sure with the

565
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:21,040
fundamentals of structure that would enable him finally to formulate the alpha helix.

566
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:27,920
They published seven papers, you know, there's one of them's alpha helix. That's the famous one.

567
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,800
Then there's a pleated sheet and a number of other things that they published at that time.

568
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:43,840
So all of this was going on and we knew it. And when polling finally on veiled his

569
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:56,960
alpha helix, I remember that was a lecture of some showmanship and I told you about that.

570
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:06,000
No, well, Caltech built these space-filling models. You have some of them here in this special collection

571
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:14,000
of the alpha helix actually, I think. And I think it was that same model which was about this

572
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,840
high and it's got red white and black atoms all distributed through it representing the various

573
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:30,560
elements. You started to give a lecture on this and this thing was in the middle of the room

574
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:36,960
who was covered with a tall paper bag. So he was going to describe the structure, you know,

575
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,760
and as he went on, people's curiosity got, they were getting more and more in the edge of his sheets.

576
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,240
And he walked over and he pulled this thing up just about that far. And he put it down and he says,

577
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:52,320
oh, he said, I forgot to, and then people sort of Twitter, he did that once more, you know,

578
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:59,600
when people laughed. And the third time he took it off and showed it was everybody applauded,

579
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:09,200
you see, he was a great showman in that respect. I remember, by the way, a lecture he gave

580
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:19,680
a quantum mechanics, I took a course in quantum mechanics for me. The room is quite full of students.

581
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:31,520
They walked in one time and he carried a big book which was the nature, I'm sorry,

582
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:41,520
introduction to quantum mechanics by him and Brian Wilson. And the normal copy is about that thick,

583
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:47,520
but this is about that thick. It turns out that every facing page of the blank so he could write

584
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,440
notes and he would lecture from this. He would come in. One day he walked in and as he got inside,

585
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:59,680
there was the room was very wide and had blackboards and they were blackboards in those days from one

586
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:06,160
end to the other. He walked in, he hooked up a piece of chalk and there were three panels here.

587
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:15,280
He wrote on the upper left hand corner in 02 nitrogen dioxide. But I'm saying a word,

588
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,440
he went across, he began to lecture and he filled up the board over here and continues like

589
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:26,160
you're filled up the board over here. And as he got to the bottom, he had reached it once,

590
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:32,560
he says, now you take an NO2 molecule and he pointed to what he had already put there. People

591
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,960
a whole hour were wondering what was going to happen, but he had it at the precise location,

592
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,160
where he needed an illustration for what he had been talking about and they had it already written

593
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:52,240
up there. That's the kind of subtle humor that he used to impress the students.

594
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,200
He gave lectures to the undergraduate too and a lot of the undergraduates were a little bit

595
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:05,520
unhappy with this. The better ones were not. The graduate teaching assistants of which I was

596
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:11,040
one when I first came there were delighted with these lectures because they were what they were

597
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:19,360
looking for. But the students, he wouldn't pick out topics in the book and talk about them,

598
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:26,080
the books book are itself. But he would talk about things associated with and that were involved

599
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:34,080
at the perhaps at the cutting level of research. And he would talk about this. And that kind of

600
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,880
disappointed a lot of the students who wanted more explanation of what they were reading in the textbook.

601
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:46,240
So anyway, as TAs, we all like the lectures very much.

602
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,240
Well, there anything else about the topic here is that we should talk about.

603
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,760
I don't know. We've talked about a lot of the personalities there.

604
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:15,120
There were a lot of people I haven't mentioned that figure prominently, for example,

605
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:27,360
Jerry Donahue's a distinguished crystallographer and he happened to be in England in the same

606
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:36,560
laboratory where Watson and Crick were and he is said to have made a key observation to them about

607
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:48,320
the configuration that played a big role in there eventually coming to the right structure for DNA.

608
01:22:48,480 --> 01:23:03,200
There are other personalities I haven't mentioned in chemistry. All sorts of names that run by,

609
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:09,680
but I don't have anything particular to say about them. I did some work with a guy named Vernon of

610
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:19,760
hockey from Switzerland. There's a very, very impressive man named Ed, your halberner. Do you know

611
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:30,320
that name Edgar King the Caltech also? He was Swiss. I think he was a Jew that left Germany in

612
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:40,640
agonist Switzerland just in the head of the Nazis and he was a superb scientist. He had a wonderful

613
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:50,160
sense of humor. He taught me how I found him at cheese fondue and he became very compactists.

614
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:58,320
Switzerland rose to the ranks. He became a distinguished professor and went to Balsal. He

615
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:05,600
inject on us were very close as families. They had apartments just a couple of doors away from each other.

616
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:17,200
Edgar died a few years ago and I had written to him when I knew that he was ill and I got a very

617
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:23,840
nice letter back from him and a year and a half later I was going to write again and then a fellow

618
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,360
named Ishen Mozart showed up to give a lecture in chemistry and I knew Ishen Mozart,

619
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:36,560
I'd given a lecture in Zurich and Halberner always spoke very highly of Ishen Mozart. So I said,

620
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:45,040
how is Edgar? He said, oh, he died. I was shocked. Absolutely shocked. And so I talked to

621
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:51,360
checked on it's about this running letter and so I hadn't heard at all. He said he apologized

622
01:24:51,360 --> 01:25:00,000
to him directly and for not having let me know that then he said at the end Edgar became very

623
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:08,480
discouraged about something he had become ill. He had lost the leg and an accident. He probably

624
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:15,440
knew all about that. Oh, I'll tell you about the minute but he came very discouraged and he was in

625
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:24,720
the hospital and finally according to Jack and appears as if he just gave up and he died in the

626
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:31,520
hospital and in spite of them being very, very close to families. I said, well, how is Ruth doing?

627
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:40,640
That's Edgar's life. He says, I don't know. He says it's amazing because she retreated into herself

628
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:47,440
and has occupied herself solely with her children and grandchildren. We haven't ever heard a word

629
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:54,720
from her and he was terribly surprised because they were very close and she was an open friendly

630
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:01,280
woman with a great sense of humor and maybe it just struck her so hard that she didn't want to

631
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:09,680
have any connection with the past at all. I wrote her a letter and I never had a response.

632
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:23,120
Offering my condolences. Edgar was a very athletic guy, particularly in a rowing.

633
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:30,560
He was a single skull guy. He wrote on the leg and so right, but he was a bunny scientist and he told me

634
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:46,560
all this. He had been out on the town with his girlfriend and they had come by the house where

635
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:53,840
he lived. It was an apartment up here on his hill and the tram came down like this. One of these

636
01:26:53,840 --> 01:27:04,560
brand new swiss trams that have all sorts of safety features on it. He was standing waiting for

637
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:11,280
the tram after having run upstairs to see whether the article he had been accepted had been published.

638
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,400
He was looking at a journal, you see. It had not been and he came back down. He was standing on the

639
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:22,480
platform with his then girlfriend and this tram came down the hill of the high rate of speed out of

640
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:34,960
my control and tipped over like this. I don't know whether his companions survived that and Ruth

641
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:43,600
was not she. I think that's true. I think she was killed, but at any rate his body went through a window

642
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:51,920
of the tram. But one leg was trapped underneath and they had to amputate it. So what I met him, he was

643
01:27:51,920 --> 01:28:02,160
using a cane and the unapocetic device. He didn't use crutches. But he was brilliant at all sorts of

644
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:11,680
awards and Switzerland for a science later on. It's hard for me to think about these people knowing

645
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:21,840
them as I did and then thinking about what would have happened to them bad. So that's

646
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:30,880
about all I can tell you, you know, there are many, many minor details, but those are the highlights,

647
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,880
I'm on all.

648
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:47,200
Okay, you want to do more of this? Okay.
