1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So there are still questions you want to ask me.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There are yes.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Just like last time, go ahead and introduce yourself the name of the date.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh yes.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Kenneth Hedberg.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the 29th of September of 2011.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So last time we pretty much finished up with Caltech,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but one thing I realized that throughout the ask you about

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
was any memories you have a day to have a day to have a day to have.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Of it all.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Only peripheral leave because I saw it together where there was

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
been fairly frequently.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Excuse me.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And she, of course, is always present at the open houses that they held occasionally.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
These open houses.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Some of the faculty and so on were invited, not for many of the students.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I saw her there.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I saw her a lot, of course, later on when she and mine

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
as came to Oregon State.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But at the time that I was at Caltech, I saw her with mine as a great deal.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's about all.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When did you make the use of the OSU and what did you decide to make that move?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When did I come to OSU or what?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, I don't know.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Have I mentioned it all?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The circumstances under which I experience the opening here.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The open.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
At Oregon State?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No, no.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,980
Oh, well, I had been working at Caltech for many years after my

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
doctorate.

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,980
And, well, many five or six.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,980
And I was actively engaged in research.

36
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,980
And I was stopped in the hole one day by Carl Neeman, who was a distinguished,

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
organic chemist.

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
The new mine knew quite well.

39
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,980
They said, can I receive the letter from a former colleague of mine?

40
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,980
I went to graduate school with at Wisconsin.

41
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
Who is now at Oregon State?

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,980
And he said, they have an opening there.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
They wondered whether I had anybody who would be interested.

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,980
Or we here at Caltech is anybody who might be interested.

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,980
I just thought I'd mention it to you in passing because I remember that you were in Oregon State

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
undergrad.

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:48,980
So, at this time, my wife was pretty unhappy in California in Barcelona because of the

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,980
air pollution.

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:03:00,980
Our first son was, our son was about to be born and she won a raising in that environment.

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,980
So, I said, yes, I'd better explore this.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:17,980
And so, I wrote them to E.C. Gilbert, who wrote back, then they did have an opening.

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,980
And one thing followed another, and it turned out that my wife and I were going to drive north

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:32,980
to Oregon to visit my parents who lived at that time in Australia.

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,980
And I said to Gilbert that I would stop on route and talk with him in members of the faculty

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
and discuss the opening.

56
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Then I got another letter from a guy named Bill Calville, will you be called well?

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Well, let me know on certain terms that the reason this was a job was because he had managed

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:02,980
to get the president of the University AL Strand to commit to new faculty hires and chemistry.

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:11,980
And it turns out that at that time, well, let me put it this way.

60
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Gilbert and Bill Calville were not on the best of terms.

61
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Gilbert was a department chairman and he told well was a professor who did almost,

62
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,980
did no research on site, but had some mining claims and other things.

63
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Kind of a more open, free-handed backslopping type, a member of the country club,

64
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,980
and a new AL Strand fairly well.

65
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:53,980
And he complained that the freshman at Oregon State and incoming students were not being given proper

66
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,980
instruction because the weren't enough professorial stuff involved in this,

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,980
just graduated teaching assistants and so on.

68
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:15,980
And he managed to can Instagram that perhaps there should be some positions set up.

69
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,980
And these would people, of course, would be nominally responsible to call those

70
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,980
since he was running the whole program.

71
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:32,980
And the main purpose of the main task of these people were going to be that they would sort of

72
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,980
ride herd on all the teaching assistants.

73
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,980
They would patrol the laboratories, make sure that the teaching assistants were doing their job.

74
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,980
They would, of course, have some responsibilities themselves, bought in the freshman program.

75
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:56,980
And they would be, in this way, and be responsible for laboratories.

76
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,980
And then, as I mentioned, patrol the laboratories regularly.

77
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,980
So I immediately sensed that there was something, there was a bit of,

78
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,980
what an adversarial relationship between Gilbert and Cole.

79
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Well, on Gilbert, of course, is interested in hiring somebody who could also increase the

80
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
research potential of the faculty.

81
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Cole wasn't in the least interested in whether these guys could do any research or not.

82
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,980
He just wanted them as sort of major domals.

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:46,980
And so I learned all of this in more detail when I came and talked with Gilbert and

84
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,980
talked with told well.

85
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:59,980
And I also had no numerous conversations with other members of the faculty,

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,980
people who have passed on now, Tom Norris,

87
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Wendell Slaball, everybody that was on the faculty that I had known before.

88
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,980
And after concluding all these interviews, we drove on down to my terrace,

89
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,980
came back to California.

90
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:31,980
So Gilbert, who was still a guy who was officially in charge of the hiring.

91
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,980
And then I would think it over and I'd let him know.

92
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,980
So after I got back to Pasadena, I thought for a long time about this.

93
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I'm decided that the conditions of this job were such that I found it unliked

94
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,980
but to be able to get my research program going at Oregon State in a reasonable length of

95
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
time.

96
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:03,980
So I declined the offer, which was $5,500 for nine months or nine months,

97
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,980
but spread over ten months.

98
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Well, my wife was very unhappy about this because she liked Oregon.

99
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,980
More like Oslo, where she grew up in Norway.

100
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,980
And she put it there was a water in the river, so I put Norris again in trees in the forest.

101
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,980
So she couldn't see that in LA.

102
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,980
We drove across a bridge one place.

103
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,980
So I pointed out to her that this was the San Gabriel river.

104
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
She looked down there was no water.

105
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,980
It was just to go like the dry was.

106
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,980
And we went through the San Gabriel forest on the outskirts.

107
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
So there's nothing but sage, bro.

108
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,980
That's the source of work on that.

109
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,980
At any rate, she was very unhappy about this.

110
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,980
And a few days later I got a call from Gilbert saying he was very sorry to receive my letter.

111
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,980
He was very much hoped that I would accept the job.

112
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,980
And he said he wondered if they were able to increase the starting

113
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,980
so I'll read a little bit what I reconsider.

114
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:28,980
And I said at this time, home life was a little frosty because at least it was so disappointed.

115
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,980
So I said, okay, I'll do that.

116
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,980
If I told you any of this at all, no, okay.

117
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,980
So the offer came back and he said we can pay you two or three hundred dollars more per year.

118
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,980
That's maybe five percent or six percent increase.

119
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,980
And so I asked Paul, what he thought about all of this.

120
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:01,980
And he invited me to come up to his home one evening after hours five o'clock or so.

121
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Can't remember exactly.

122
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,980
So I went up to 4,500 per point.

123
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Whatever the street number is or yeah, he's awesome.

124
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,980
You said I'm up around to discuss the job.

125
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,980
I've been very active in research at Caltech.

126
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,980
And a number of published papers, lots of things going.

127
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,980
And I expressed to him, my fear that I was going not going to be able to get my research program going

128
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,980
at Oregon State because it involved the construction of apparatus.

129
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,980
You saw that apparatus.

130
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
I had to build that by hand.

131
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,980
There were extremely limited machine shop facilities.

132
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Nothing in the chemistry department at all.

133
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,980
And I didn't see how I could get that instrument built as Oregon State.

134
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:58,980
So I expressed all this to him and then told him that the actual number of hours that I was expected to be in contact with students

135
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,980
was something like 15 or 16 hours a week.

136
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,980
Just in the hands-on contact,

137
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,980
that's about 30% or a little bit more than that.

138
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,980
35% of the total time, not counting preparation or anything in that side.

139
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,980
And falling, sort of lean back and his chair was sitting inside by side looking out over the valley.

140
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
And the swimming pool.

141
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,980
He says, well, he says, I don't know.

142
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
He says 15 hours.

143
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
He says, well, I was at Oregon State.

144
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,980
I was teaching 40 hours a week.

145
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,980
That was the year that he was a sophomore.

146
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:47,980
And had been asked to handle the course for young women in home economics.

147
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,980
I think it was taking chemistry as a requirement.

148
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,980
That's where he met his wife, either Helen.

149
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
But anyway, that's the story, you know.

150
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,980
So anyhow, he said 40 hours, he says, I don't know.

151
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:08,980
He said, I think that Oregon State will not be a first class institution for research in my time.

152
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,980
And probably not in yours.

153
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
These are his words.

154
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,980
He says, on the other hand, that's not really important in a bigger sense.

155
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,980
He says, if you didn't get your program going,

156
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,980
you'll be very happy there.

157
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Oregon is a wonderful place to live as you and I know.

158
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
He says, I don't know.

159
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I think it might be worthwhile giving a chance.

160
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
I think you could make it go on.

161
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
You'd be very happy there.

162
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:43,980
So with that encouragement, I told Gilbert up and said, yes, I would accept the offer.

163
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,980
And my wife, of course, was delighted at this because at this time,

164
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,980
our son had just been born.

165
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:04,980
And we lived in Pasadena, a down below, not far from Caltech.

166
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,980
And the small grid roll in the morning about 11 o'clock,

167
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,980
and she'd take the baby in, close all the doors and windows.

168
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Keep them closed all about four and they have to know.

169
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,980
When the winds reverse their directions swept all the small back out to see again.

170
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
And she'd get open things up.

171
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,980
It was pretty hot too, so I had a hose in this garden cottage

172
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,980
that I put on the route and turn on the water to keep it cool.

173
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,980
During the time that she was so to speak incarcerated.

174
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Anyway, that fall.

175
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,980
I told Gilbert that I wouldn't be able to come in the fall,

176
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,980
by the fall term, but I could come January 1st.

177
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,980
This was January 1st was 1956, so this is all in 1955.

178
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,980
This conversation went up.

179
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:13,980
So, come January, we drove north after Christmas in times of a huge storm

180
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,980
that actually led to flooding.

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,980
This is a fine way for my life to be introduced to the worst Puerto Vallas.

182
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,980
You don't know anything today about how it was then,

183
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,980
but we drove up to Eugene, got the junction city,

184
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,980
and it turned out that the 99 West was closed

185
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,980
because of water and the roads.

186
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,980
But there was a bus going up 99 East to Albany,

187
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,980
and I, with our car, the baby in the back,

188
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,980
can be said, we followed this bus very carefully up,

189
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,980
sometimes water almost up to the hubcaps of the car,

190
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,980
got to Albany, and then it turned out that the road from Albany

191
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
to Corvallas was okay.

192
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,980
It wasn't underwater yet, but the road from Corvallas south

193
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
on 99 West was underwater.

194
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,980
So we met and why that we managed to get the Corvallas

195
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,980
and by free arrangement we had run out of the house,

196
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,980
of a faculty member that was going to be away for three months.

197
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,980
So we had a place to move into immediately,

198
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,980
all furnished very nice house,

199
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
um, sentimenty,

200
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,980
uh, over there against the hill and salt,

201
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,980
uh, well, you know what it is.

202
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Um, it's very nice.

203
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,980
And turned out that everything was flooded

204
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
the following day or two in Corvallas.

205
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
You could hardly get around it all,

206
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,980
and then it turned cold later on,

207
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
and snow came and so on.

208
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,980
So that was my introduction to Corvallas.

209
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,980
I showed up to work on one of the early days,

210
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,980
and Gilbert told me all they had a,

211
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,980
a kind of a bonus to give me.

212
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,980
And that was that I was going to be, uh,

213
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,980
assigned a teacher course in a graduate course in physical chemistry

214
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:19,980
to, uh, to, uh, organic chemist largely on others.

215
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Well, this sounded like a bonus to him,

216
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
but for somebody just coming there,

217
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
I mean this is a lecture three hours a week,

218
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
and I had never done this course before.

219
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
So I had all those lecture notes to prepare,

220
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,980
as well as the stuff I was expected to do under Bill Coldwell's, uh,

221
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
uh, regime.

222
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,980
So I had a very, very busy time and with a newborn

223
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,980
in the house of my wife, you know, trying hard to,

224
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,980
the customer self to life and a new place with a new baby,

225
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,980
and a husband who was up to his ears and work

226
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,980
wasn't very easy.

227
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,980
I, uh, but pretty discouraged at the end of that term,

228
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,980
and, uh, as a term to run,

229
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,980
I took care of you right down on, uh,

230
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,980
a piece of paper divided into days and hours of the day

231
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
for a week, each week.

232
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,980
How much time I was actually spending

233
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,980
in duties connected with teaching,

234
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
by connected with that man,

235
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,980
in the, in the students one-on-one preparation,

236
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,980
including evening hours and everything else,

237
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,980
and I was averaging that first term,

238
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
fifty-six hours a week,

239
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,980
only in teaching related duties.

240
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,980
And so my fears about getting my programs started on the research side,

241
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,980
well, well, born out by that first experience.

242
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,980
And of course, I was expected not only to have a program

243
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
during getting my research going,

244
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,980
but I had to build this apparatus,

245
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
which meant that I had to design it,

246
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
sit down with, uh,

247
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I think I showed you just briefly,

248
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
folders of those drawings in there.

249
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,980
I had a drawing table in my office,

250
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,980
and so I spent a lot of time with drawing these things,

251
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,980
and then Professor Junker in physics,

252
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I had a fine physics shop,

253
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
and I went across to see him,

254
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
and he agreed,

255
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
he saved my life actually,

256
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,980
to allow one of the people in physics,

257
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,980
I think they had through a form of shenus,

258
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,980
who would be assigned to my job,

259
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
and he would do everything,

260
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,980
and he and I would be on one-to-one contact all the time.

261
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,980
He reserved the right to retake this man

262
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,980
for any projects that physics needed, of course,

263
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,980
since he was employed by physics,

264
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,980
and using the physics facilities,

265
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,980
and that worked out just beautifully.

266
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Took a long time to get the apparatus built

267
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,980
through four years,

268
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,980
but it was finally done and put together

269
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
and we managed to make it go.

270
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,980
So, that Junker's facilities and his kindness

271
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,980
really are responsible for getting me off the ground

272
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
in Oregon State.

273
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,980
So, would you describe the advance a little bit for me?

274
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
Sorry.

275
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
describe the apparatus for me.

276
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Oh, well, the apparatus is what is called

277
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,980
an electron defraction unit.

278
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,980
It consists of the essential feature of it

279
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
is an electron gun that will produce

280
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,980
a well-colonated beam of electrons

281
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,980
at the potential of about 60 kilobiles.

282
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,980
So, it's a very energetic beam

283
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,980
on the scale of the way chemistry operates.

284
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,980
That beam is admitted into a large vacuum chamber

285
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,980
in my apparatus, the whole thing is mounted vertically,

286
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,980
so the beam comes down into this vacuum chamber,

287
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,980
and at the bottom of the beam,

288
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,980
let's say, is a detecting beam,

289
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,980
which is in my case, photographic film,

290
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,980
and those those photographic plates,

291
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
but it's no photographic film,

292
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,980
and this photographic film is eight by ten inches square

293
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,980
and is perpendicular to the beam

294
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,980
and is moved into position by mechanism

295
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,980
that I built into the apparatus.

296
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,980
And the apparatus is designed to study

297
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,980
the structures of molecules and the gas phase

298
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,980
by diffracting this beam of electrons from them.

299
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,980
So, we have a long nozzle that protrudes

300
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,980
into the apparatus with a tip that passes

301
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,980
that stops just about a millimeter short

302
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
and where there's very fine high-power

303
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,980
electron beam is coming down.

304
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Now, if in this nozzle, which is a two

305
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
with a fine tip on it,

306
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,980
you admit a gas into the chamber,

307
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
the gas shoots out the nozzle tip,

308
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,980
intersects the electron beam at right angles

309
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,980
and produces what is called a diffraction pattern.

310
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,980
This diffraction pattern consists of what happens

311
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,980
is, of course, it's recorded on this photographic film

312
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,980
at the underneath the nozzle

313
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
and perpendicular to the beam.

314
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,980
So, the diffraction pattern is recorded on this

315
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,980
in a set of diffuse rings of varying intensity

316
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,980
and the spacing of these rings

317
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,980
and their shapes of the pattern

318
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,980
contain all the structural information

319
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,980
about the length of the inter atomic distances

320
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,980
in the molecule.

321
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,980
And so, we take these patterns and we analyze

322
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,980
and then out of that, we can deduce the

323
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
intimate details of the structures

324
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,980
of these molecules in the gas phase

325
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,980
that is essentially, it's a structure of a single molecule

326
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
because so far apart,

327
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
they don't interact with one another

328
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,980
as they shoot into the apparatus.

329
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,980
And so, that's what I was charged with

330
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
or what I wanted to build

331
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
and which I found we got going.

332
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
So, all those errors.

333
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,980
It's still running and rough.

334
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Yeah, and it is running

335
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
and right now, and running beautifully,

336
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,980
we just did an experiment last week.

337
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Beautiful patterns we got for a new molecule

338
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
or interested in.

339
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
It doesn't take long for the experiment

340
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,980
as quite interesting.

341
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,980
The technique is developed enormously

342
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,980
since the days when I first entered the field

343
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,980
at Caltech as a graduate student.

344
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,980
And now, the experiment that lasts

345
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,980
is diffraction pattern.

346
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
You expose the photographic film

347
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
to the diffraction pattern

348
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,980
for only two or three minutes

349
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,980
and you might want to make five different films

350
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
or ten different films.

351
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
So, all told you can do the entire experiment

352
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,980
in a day if you push it.

353
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Everything.

354
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,980
And that's all the day to you need

355
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
for what might be for a graduate student

356
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,980
a year and a half of work analyzing it.

357
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,980
So, the apparatus mostly sits on use

358
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,980
because we can quickly gather all the day to we knew.

359
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
So, I've had a lot of visitors who have come

360
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
used the apparatus.

361
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
And if I had a technician,

362
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
I could supply all the diffraction data

363
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
every group in the world.

364
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
This technician did nothing

365
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,980
but take diffraction pictures

366
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
of the substances involved.

367
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Now, maybe a little more complicated

368
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,980
because these are gas phase molecules

369
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,980
we admit them in the chamber as a gas.

370
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,980
But that doesn't mean that they have to be a gas

371
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
as you look at them.

372
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
You can put them on the table.

373
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,980
The fact is you've got to get them

374
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,980
to the gas phase in order to make this experiment work.

375
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Well, we have a sort of ovens

376
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,980
and heated nozzle so we can heat these things up

377
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,980
and get the vapor C60

378
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
that we've worked on.

379
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Of course, it's very intractable

380
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,980
as no vapor pressure at all is because

381
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,980
so we had to heat this substance

382
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,980
in an oven to 800

383
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,980
and some of degrees Celsius

384
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,980
in order to get the tiniest bit of vapor from it.

385
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,980
But that was sufficient to give us a diffraction pattern

386
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
and we were able to determine the structure

387
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,980
of this material which is a carbon-like powder

388
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
on the table.

389
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,980
So, we have all sorts of exiliar apparatus

390
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,980
which allows us to produce gas molecules

391
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,980
from lots of different circumstances.

392
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,980
So, it works very nicely.

393
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
I'm very happy with it.

394
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,980
I should add as a...

395
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
as a...

396
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Postgriptol is that this technique

397
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,980
was very powerful

398
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,980
through the 40s and 50s and 60s

399
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
even in the 70s.

400
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,980
But there are other techniques

401
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
that have developed in the meantime too

402
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,980
and so there are fewer and fewer laboratories

403
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,980
in the world doing this work.

404
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,980
When I came to Oregon State and got mine going

405
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,980
there were about...

406
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
there were only two laboratories

407
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
in the United States

408
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
that this kind of worked mine

409
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,980
and a laboratory at Michigan.

410
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,980
There were other people who...

411
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Well, there was another apparatus built.

412
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
It didn't...

413
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,980
It worked for a while, but not very long.

414
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,980
And there was one of Texas that was built,

415
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
similar to that.

416
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,980
But it was built in the physics department

417
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,980
and the interest there was not the same as the interest

418
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
but chemisown.

419
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,980
And so, it worked for a while

420
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,980
and then it stopped.

421
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,980
And later on, there were apparatus

422
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,980
in Britain.

423
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,980
There was one in Edinburgh.

424
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,980
And later on,

425
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,980
and still, Extant is one in Reading England.

426
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,980
There was one in Germany.

427
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
They were very active in Germany.

428
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,980
And when I first started, there was one in Belgium

429
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,980
and one in Holland.

430
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,980
And several, in at that time, the Soviet Union.

431
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,980
And two or three laboratories in Japan.

432
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,980
All of them had apparatus and could do experiments.

433
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,980
All of those are gone except the apparatus in Reading.

434
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,980
The apparatus in Germany, by the way,

435
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,980
the man who was the professor who was in charge

436
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,980
of that laboratory retired.

437
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,980
His name was Heinz Oberhommer.

438
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,980
And his apparatus has been transferred to an

439
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,980
inorganic chemist who is using it as kind of an

440
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,980
exiduary to his main work,

441
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,980
which is the preparation and interesting inorganic compounds.

442
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,980
And as a part of that, he wants to know what the structures are.

443
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,980
The apparatus in Reading is still Extant.

444
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,980
But the man who was in charge of it before

445
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
has now retired.

446
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,980
And the woman that was working with him

447
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,980
has a permanent position at the University.

448
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
But she's heavily involved with teaching

449
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
and has very little time to work with it.

450
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,980
There were two important laboratories in Norway.

451
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,980
I didn't mention them earlier.

452
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Both of them are now gone as far as apparatus is concerned.

453
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,980
There isn't any further support for it in that

454
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,980
in science decisions are always made about where you're going to put

455
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
a limited amount of phones.

456
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,980
And in Norway, it's now determined that this particular area of

457
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,980
research will not be supported anymore by the University.

458
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,980
In the sense that they will hire technicians and

459
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,980
professorial rank people to do this kind of work.

460
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,980
And I share that will probably be the case here at Oregon State, too.

461
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
So we don't know.

462
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,980
It's plain fact is it's not judged by what's going on

463
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,980
in the world of chemistry today.

464
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Cutting his stuff.

465
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,980
A lot of the things that's going on today

466
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,980
isn't shifted more into larger molecule biological

467
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,980
biological things, synthetic organic chemistry,

468
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,980
new material, things of that sort, and not the kind of basic science

469
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,980
that I was involved with for all those years.

470
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
So anyway, I came to Oregon State,

471
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
got a built and I've been here ever since

472
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
doing with this kind of research.

473
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
That's what it's all about.

474
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
And great fun.

475
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
So what were the techniques that you used to analyze the

476
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
direction patterns?

477
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,980
Well, yes, that's a good question.

478
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,980
I don't know how much of the technology I ought to

479
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
go into.

480
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,980
But essentially, you're faced with this photographic film.

481
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,980
If you hold it up to the light, you see this beautiful pattern of

482
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,980
circular rings of varying intensity, very diffuse,

483
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,980
easily recognized, going out from a central point.

484
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,980
And all the information about the structure of the molecules

485
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,980
contained, as I said earlier, in the spaceings and the shapes of

486
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
these rings.

487
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,980
The question that you're really asking is how do you go from that

488
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,980
to determine how a molecule was put together?

489
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Well, it turns out that these rings are related to the structure of

490
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,980
the molecule by some according to theory by a rather simple way.

491
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,980
I'll keep it as simple as a possibly count.

492
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,980
Every inter-atomic distance in the molecule creates

493
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,980
an effect on this film, a pattern that consists of nothing more than a

494
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,980
sine wave, going from the middle out.

495
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,980
Now a sine wave just goes up and down, up and down, up and down,

496
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,980
all the way out to the end of the photographic plate.

497
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,980
So if you have a die-accompanied molecule, all the rings in their

498
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,980
intensity would look like a sine wave, just from the beginning,

499
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,980
up, down, up, down, the spacing would be identical between them,

500
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,980
aside from some geometric factors that I don't have to go into.

501
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,980
So all you have to do is to measure the frequency, oh,

502
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I should say that the farther apart, the two atoms are

503
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,980
that are giving rise to this sine wave, the greater the frequency of the

504
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
sine wave.

505
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,980
So two atoms that are far apart like this give a sine wave that goes up and

506
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,980
down very rapidly, two atoms that are very close together will give a

507
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,980
sine wave that has a very long wavelength.

508
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,980
So you'll see very few rings.

509
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,980
So all you'd have to do is to measure the spacing between these

510
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,980
rings and that is related by theory to how far apart the atoms are.

511
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Now that's for a die-accompanied, let's say that's the case for a

512
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,980
die-accompanied molecule, you only have one sine wave.

513
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,980
The die-accompanied molecule vibrates, and so the atoms are not

514
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,980
rigid, they're moving back and forth away from one another like two

515
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,980
moles on a spring.

516
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,980
And of course that means that the distance is in constant.

517
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Well it turns out according to theory to a good approximation.

518
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,980
This sine wave instead of having constant amplitude all the way up,

519
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,980
dies off due to this vibration.

520
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,980
So you measure the dying off of the sine wave and that tells you how

521
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,980
big the amplitude of this vibration is.

522
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
So we learn about two things.

523
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,980
The distances between the atoms on the average and we learn about how

524
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,980
much they're moving with respect to one another by measuring the

525
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
damping off of the sine wave.

526
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Well of course there aren't many die-accompanied molecules left

527
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,980
to study, but every that problem or rather the theory that I

528
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,980
mentioned applies to just the pairs of atoms.

529
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,980
So if you have a molecule that has more than just two atoms in it,

530
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,980
you're going to have more than two distances, more than one distance.

531
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Every pair of atoms in the molecule gives rise to one of these sine

532
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
waves.

533
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,980
So carbon dioxide is a linear molecule, is a carbon oxygen bond,

534
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,980
and that gives rise to a single sine wave that goes out.

535
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,980
There are two of them, but they have exactly the same distance,

536
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,980
so there are two sine waves that are right on top of one another.

537
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Then you have the distance between the oxygen atoms,

538
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
and that's twice as big.

539
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,980
So it generates a sine wave also, which has a frequency,

540
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,980
twice as great to first approximation,

541
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,980
as the frequency in the carbon oxygen,

542
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,980
because the distance is twice as long.

543
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,980
And that gives a sine wave that oscillates with twice the frequency

544
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,980
in the first one, and they're on top of one another.

545
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,980
So the pattern is no longer a simple sine wave,

546
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,980
but a collection of two sine waves.

547
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,980
If you know how to separate out these sine waves and measure their

548
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,980
frequencies, then you know exactly what the structure of this molecule is.

549
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,980
So I'll see you'll two were bent, like NL2 is,

550
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,980
NL2 would be entirely similar,

551
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,980
but there you would find the distances between the oxygen atoms,

552
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,980
is not twice the distance between the nitrogen and oxygen,

553
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,980
because it's a triangular molecule, like this.

554
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,980
So that oxygen oxygen distance would not be moving

555
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,980
as twice the frequency of the NL, but less than that.

556
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,980
So you can immediately determine that distance,

557
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,980
and determine the nitrogen oxygen distance,

558
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,980
and by comparing them, you know what the bound angle is in the molecule.

559
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,980
This simple account can be applied to molecules that are very, very complicated.

560
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,980
The entire problem, man, is just to separate out what these different sine waves are.

561
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Construct yourself a model that will account for all of the distances,

562
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
and then you have the structure of the molecule.

563
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,980
It is, in practice, considerably more complicated than I'm telling you,

564
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,980
but that's essentially the features of the whole thing.

565
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Now, you asked how we do this.

566
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Well, we have to measure the frequencies,

567
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,980
and to do that, we have a scanner,

568
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,980
what is called a micro-densitometer.

569
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,980
The film is placed on the bed of this micro-densitometer,

570
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,980
and the film, in the apparatus that I have,

571
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,980
we have a mechanism that rotates the film around its center.

572
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:58,980
The purpose of this is that you are averaging the information around the entire circle.

573
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,980
If the densitometer consists of a beam that passes through the film,

574
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,980
and a detector that measures how intense the light beam is as it comes through the film.

575
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,980
So in the ring is intense, the light beam that comes through is much reduced,

576
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,980
and when the film is very more transparent,

577
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,980
the beam that comes through there is more intense.

578
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,980
So you get a recording of the blackness of the film.

579
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
So this thing translates,

580
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,980
and we have electronic data accumulation system

581
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:51,980
that measures the intensity of the blackness of the film

582
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,980
as a function from the center outward.

583
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
And that gives us digital data,

584
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,980
and that's what we actually work with to analyze.

585
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
So that's essentially it,

586
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,980
and without having given the laboratory for a week,

587
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,980
I can't tell you much more that we're making clear here, I don't think.

588
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,980
So what are any other questions about that?

589
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,980
How have you decided which modules did this study?

590
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Yeah, well, this largely comes from your own,

591
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,980
in my case, my own interests, let's say,

592
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,980
or the principal investigators interest.

593
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Now, if we take C60, for example,

594
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,980
that was big news at the time it was discovered.

595
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,980
And I had a former student named Bob Johnson,

596
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:52,980
who was working at IBM in San Jose.

597
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,980
And they had managed to create or had a sample of this stuff.

598
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Now, in the beginning, it was very rare.

599
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:09,980
I mean, a few, well, you could get it in

600
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,980
in milligram quantities.

601
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,980
And I, the sample, I actually worked at,

602
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,980
I think, had 300 milligrams in it.

603
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,980
And it was a little bit of black powder in a while.

604
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,980
And at doing market prices,

605
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,980
that was $5,000 worth of sample.

606
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Well, Bob wrote to me, and he asked me,

607
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
how could we do this?

608
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Could you do this work?

609
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,980
I said, well, no, I'm very exciting.

610
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
We should try.

611
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,980
And so they supplied the sample.

612
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Several people in IBM and were involved in this project

613
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,980
and leasing me up here.

614
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,980
And so we got the sample and we managed to,

615
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,980
it was very exciting because I didn't know

616
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,980
whether we were going to be able to get a pattern

617
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,980
from this stuff at all.

618
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Because it was so refractory.

619
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,980
You know, we had to heat it so hot.

620
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,980
And the other, we had it.

621
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,980
And with so hot, I was going red in the apparatus.

622
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,980
Now fortunately, the film that we use is not very sensitive

623
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
to red light.

624
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,980
Secondly, I was able to build a shield around them all,

625
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,980
or it protected the film from almost all of the glow.

626
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,980
As I heated it up, I could see it glowing.

627
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
Bright red in there.

628
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
And then I would close up the window to the apparatus

629
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,980
and turn off the beam, lecture on beam,

630
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,980
and quickly move the plate in position.

631
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Open up the beam and expose this.

632
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,980
I could not see evidence of any, we have a fluorescent screen

633
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,980
in there that we can see patterns on for most molecules.

634
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
At the time we did the experiment,

635
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,980
I couldn't see anything on this fluorescent screen

636
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,980
other than a very faint glow from the screen.

637
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,980
So I didn't know whether we were getting anything or not.

638
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,980
And so we made two or three of these exposures.

639
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,980
And I took the film into the dark room,

640
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,980
and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a beautiful pattern

641
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,980
was you couldn't predict it.

642
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
It would be like that.

643
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,980
Or that you would even get one from seeing

644
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
there was no evidence.

645
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,980
Normally when I run stuff on the apparatus,

646
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,980
I put the main beam through a slot in a fluorescent screen

647
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,980
so I can see the scattering all around it.

648
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,980
And I can see it just, it'll look like this on a black thing

649
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
somewhat reduced.

650
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
I can see we're getting scattering.

651
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Couldn't see that with C60.

652
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,980
And yet there it was.

653
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,980
And I'm absolutely beautiful pattern.

654
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
It was very exciting.

655
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,980
Anybody got a complicated analysis?

656
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
Was it what?

657
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,980
Well, it turns out.

658
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Bucky balls, if you pick up a soccer ball,

659
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,980
and you look to see how the things are put together,

660
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,980
there are hexagons in it,

661
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
and pentagons in it.

662
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,980
And they're put together in a completely symmetric way.

663
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,980
And it turns out that in Bucky balls

664
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,980
are on a soccer thing,

665
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,980
the length of the stitching

666
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,980
in a soccer ball.

667
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Yeah, it's a little hard to describe,

668
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:55,980
but there are bonds that link two six-member patches together

669
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,980
and stitches that link a six-member to a five-member.

670
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:07,980
And those two bond lengths are different in C60 itself.

671
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,980
Those are the only two parameters

672
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,980
that are necessary to determine the structure of C60,

673
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,980
assuming that it is a soccer ball.

674
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,980
That's the assumption that you make,

675
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,980
and that was well characterized by NMR

676
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,980
spectrum and other things.

677
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,980
So we knew it was a soccer ball type,

678
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,980
but we didn't know what the length of these bonds were.

679
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,980
So if you then have the only thing that changes

680
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,980
that doesn't change the shape,

681
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,980
it only changes the size of the six-member

682
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
and the five-member ring,

683
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,980
as you change the length of these bonds.

684
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Well, we had to put together a model,

685
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,980
that is to say that you see what you actually do

686
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,980
and analysis, you have the experimental pattern,

687
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,980
and then you have to generate a model

688
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,980
and compare the pattern that this model gives

689
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,980
with the one that you experience experimentally.

690
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:32,980
So you are fitting a model for which you have calculated a pattern,

691
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,980
and you adjust that pattern to fit the experiment

692
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,980
by changing the parameters of a model.

693
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,980
So to make this applying this to C60,

694
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,980
the pattern depends only on the relative length

695
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,980
of those two distances that I mentioned.

696
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,980
The one between six-member rings

697
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,980
and the one between a six-member ring.

698
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,980
And so my wife then put together the model,

699
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,980
and you can imagine it's not easy.

700
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,980
You have to remember,

701
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,980
generate every distance in the molecule

702
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,980
from just these two parameters.

703
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,980
There are 720 distances in the molecule,

704
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,980
and she constructed a program

705
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,980
that would calculate this model for us.

706
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,980
And that was the one we used and tested,

707
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,980
and that led finally to the fitting and the structure of the thing.

708
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,980
And we published that in science,

709
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,980
a couple of decades ago now, I guess.

710
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,980
There is lots of fun.

711
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,980
I wanted to ask also about denonence of glory.

712
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,980
Which one?

713
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Denonence of glory.

714
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
Denonence of glory.

715
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,980
We never actually finished the structure of that thing,

716
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,980
because a friend of mine at the University of Michigan

717
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,980
had done a very good job,

718
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,980
and he was an head of us.

719
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,980
We worked on other xenon compounds.

720
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,980
We did xenon tetroxide,

721
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
which is four oxygen atoms,

722
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,980
arranged in the form of a tetrahedron around a xenon atom.

723
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,980
And that was a quite an experience,

724
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
because a very explosive compound,

725
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
we had several minor explosions,

726
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,980
but you couldn't,

727
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,980
we had to generate the compound on the apparatus,

728
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,980
by adding acid to a

729
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,980
a prezenate as it's called,

730
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,980
a compound which contains xenon with the,

731
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,980
but it's a salt.

732
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,980
And we had to build an apparatus

733
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,980
where we could tip this up slightly,

734
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,980
and add acid to this,

735
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,980
where upon the xenon tetroxide

736
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,980
would be formed,

737
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,980
and could flow into our apparatus through our nozzle.

738
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,980
There were several times,

739
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,980
the stuff in our gas phase is very unstable.

740
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,980
We had several times,

741
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,980
very minor explosions,

742
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,980
and minor in the sense that,

743
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,980
there was no danger to anybody involved here,

744
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,980
but it blew holes in our conducting line right away.

745
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,980
So we had that happen several times.

746
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,980
That's the only xenon compound

747
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,980
that we actually finished the structure of,

748
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,980
the xenon tetroxide.

749
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Were there other compounds there,

750
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,980
and could they memorable or be waiting?

751
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
Well,

752
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,980
the ones that we've talked about

753
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,980
are one sort of in the public eye.

754
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,980
So,

755
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,980
I think in terms of public interest

756
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
of something very novel,

757
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,980
probably not so much.

758
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,980
The work that we do,

759
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,980
I've always tended to characterize

760
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
in the term used in the old days,

761
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
which is basic research.

762
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,980
And I had no really discernible

763
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
practical applications,

764
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,980
but it was fundamental stuff,

765
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,980
and there are a lot of fundamental problems

766
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,980
in chemistry.

767
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
For example,

768
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,980
chemistry has it as practiced

769
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,980
at some level or another,

770
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,980
makes continuous and intimate use

771
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,980
of the concept of the structure

772
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,980
of the things you're dealing with.

773
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,980
I mean,

774
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,980
we talked about the structure of proteins, for example.

775
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,980
We talked about the structure of almost everything,

776
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,980
an organic chemistry structure

777
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,980
is when electures on the board.

778
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,980
So we were involved in determining structures,

779
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,980
but what we were doing

780
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,980
is actually measuring these structures

781
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,980
to very high precision.

782
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,980
We're not just making a ball and stick drawing.

783
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,980
We're looking at the distances between the atoms

784
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,980
and trying to deduce from this,

785
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
how these distances

786
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,980
might be related to the reactivity

787
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,980
of the molecule and things of that sort.

788
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,980
How the intimate details of the structure

789
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,980
distances,

790
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,980
well let me put it this way,

791
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,980
size and shape of the molecule

792
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,980
are related to this reactivity.

793
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,980
I can give you one example of this.

794
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,980
That most people don't know about,

795
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,980
but a very common chemical compound

796
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,980
in nature is nitrogen dioxide that comes from

797
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,980
combustion of internal engines under high temperatures

798
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,980
and so on.

799
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,980
Well nitrogen dioxide is a triangular molecule

800
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,980
with a nitrogen that they apex.

801
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,980
And two of these nitrogen oxins nitrogen dioxide molecules

802
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,980
come together in a form of tetramer.

803
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,980
I mean a dimer that has

804
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,980
it's called di nitrogen tetroxide.

805
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,980
Now a remarkable thing of this

806
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,980
is that these two molecules come together

807
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,980
and fall apart, come together and fall apart

808
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,980
just so easily.

809
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,980
If you have N02 in the gas phase,

810
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,980
you have N204 in the gas phase also.

811
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,980
As you change the temperature and pressure,

812
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
the amount of one of these

813
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,980
with respect to the other changes.

814
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:45,980
Well, N204 is very hard to

815
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,980
it falls apart so easily.

816
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,980
It's very hard to measure.

817
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,980
Structure on it.

818
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,980
But we undertook that job.

819
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,980
And the way it was done

820
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:12,980
is that we got a sample of N02

821
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,980
and the reaction for the decomposition

822
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,980
or dimersation or de-diamersation

823
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
is extremely rapid.

824
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,980
It just flows apart immediately

825
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,980
or comes together immediately.

826
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,980
Well, if you cool it down,

827
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,980
the stream down.

828
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,980
What happens is you get

829
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,980
more and more of N204

830
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,980
as you heat it up.

831
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,980
All of this is decomposed right away

832
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,980
because of the thermal effects.

833
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,980
So what we did was cool a sample

834
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
to the oven.

835
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,980
I mean sorry, the nozzle way way down.

836
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
Well, way down below zero

837
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
of Celsius.

838
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
Run the stuff through it

839
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,980
and we got beautiful pictures of N204.

840
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,980
Then we heated it up a little bit

841
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,980
and we could see all the characteristic distances

842
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,980
for that molecule beginning to disappear

843
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,980
as if the higher we heated it,

844
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,980
the less of those we had.

845
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,980
We got it to 100 and some on degrees

846
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,980
there's nothing but N02 present.

847
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,980
Well, the structure of N204

848
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
turns out to be very interesting.

849
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,980
It turns out that there is an extraordinarily long

850
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,980
NN bond.

851
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,980
The bonds between atoms in typical compounds

852
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,980
tend to be more or less the same.

853
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,980
For example, saturated hydrocarbons

854
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,980
have carbon carbon bonds and I can tell you right away

855
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,980
they will be 1.54 or 1.535 angstroms

856
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,980
to within 100 of an angstrom

857
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,980
in no matter what compound you look at.

858
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Well, there's a characteristic NN bond

859
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,980
2 and NO bonds.

860
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,980
And it turned out that this NN bond

861
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,980
was very, very long.

862
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,980
So much so that by a simple criteria

863
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,980
that line is falling in the degrees one time,

864
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,980
it's only in the order of a tenth

865
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,980
as strong as a normal single bond.

866
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,980
So that accounts for about 4 to 4 days away.

867
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,980
But one thing this characteristic of single bonds

868
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,980
is that the two ends of a molecule

869
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,980
can rotate around like this.

870
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,980
You see, they're not fixed like this

871
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
because of the bond as a week.

872
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,980
To our intense surprise, that's not the case of N204.

873
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,980
It's a flat, plain or molecule,

874
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,980
no matter how long this bond is.

875
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,980
So what is it that holds a flat, you see?

876
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,980
Well, that's not a single bond

877
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,980
don't hold things flat.

878
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,980
Why is this flat?

879
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,980
Well, that was the interesting question of the time.

880
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:00,980
And it turns out that the structure

881
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,980
of the N02 part of the N204 molecule

882
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:09,980
is almost identically that of the separated N02.

883
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,980
That is bringing the two together

884
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,980
to make the dimer doesn't change the structure

885
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,980
of the ends of all.

886
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Normally, if you bring them together,

887
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,980
if you take two monomers and you bring them together,

888
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,980
these will change somewhat in angles and distances,

889
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,980
not with N204.

890
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,980
But these are puzzles that are just lots of fun

891
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,980
to think about, that's all.

892
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,980
And so this kind of research

893
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
is the thing that's characterized

894
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,980
what these and I have done most of our career here.

895
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,980
We have all sorts of different systems that pose different

896
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,980
basic chemical questions.

897
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,980
And we look at molecules to try to find out

898
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,980
what we can learn about these basic chemical questions,

899
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,980
answers to them from studying the structures

900
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,980
of maybe even a series of several molecules

901
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,980
that have other some things in common,

902
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,980
some things different to see how the differences

903
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,980
are going to affect properties of the molecules.

904
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,980
So that's what we do.

905
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,980
So you've got your apparatus constructed

906
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,980
and do I have to send it to your teaching world

907
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,980
to decrease some?

908
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,980
Oh.

909
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,980
Well, in due course,

910
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,980
and those days the chemistry department

911
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
consisted of four divisions.

912
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,980
There was organic, inorganic,

913
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,980
physical, and analytical.

914
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,980
They were pretty clearly defined.

915
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,980
People were in these divisions in accordance

916
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,980
with the kind of research they did.

917
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,980
Well, there came an opening in physical chemistry

918
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,980
and Gilbert this chairman told me immediately

919
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,980
that when that opening a card

920
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,980
he was going to move me into that division.

921
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,980
Well, this was two or three years later.

922
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,980
The other, oh, by the two jobs were filled

923
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:05,980
that this monitoring of the laboratories

924
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:10,980
that brought me here called roles.

925
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,980
Efforts.

926
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,980
The other person was Tom Parsons.

927
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,980
Tom Parsons was in chemistry for a while,

928
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,980
but moved into administration

929
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,980
and finishes career in areas in the ministerial.

930
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:30,980
Well, that I moved into physical chemistry,

931
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,980
Gilbert, and I became a physical chemist

932
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,980
and my teaching responsibilities has changed a lot.

933
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,980
I no longer wrote heard on TAs,

934
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,980
but I still taught general chemistry,

935
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,980
but I also began to teach courses regularly

936
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,980
in physical chemistry.

937
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,980
So my contact hours went down,

938
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,980
but the amount of time I spent working

939
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,980
certainly didn't, because now I had

940
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,980
the contact hour before

941
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,980
we're just, you know, I knew the experiments

942
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,980
and freshman chemistry the kids were doing,

943
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,980
and I could walk through and make sure

944
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,980
that they were getting a proper attention

945
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,980
and so on, but now I had to prepare lectures

946
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,980
and in courses that I hadn't lectured in before.

947
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,980
But the contact hours went down,

948
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,980
but the amount of time spent teaching

949
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,980
didn't diminish for quite a while.

950
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,980
But nevertheless, my apparatus was coming along

951
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,980
and I was very lucky when I came here

952
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,980
because I had all the money I needed to build this.

953
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,980
I got some money from the research corporation

954
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,980
before I arrived.

955
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,980
I applied for that at Caltech,

956
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,980
and I came with a Sloan foundation grant

957
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,980
which was five years of money

958
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,980
that I used for summer support,

959
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
and I wasn't teaching,

960
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,980
and then I could do it fully

961
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,980
to drawing up parts from my apparatus and so on.

962
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,980
And then I got NSF support too,

963
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,980
so I never lacked for funding

964
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,980
the main thing I've had trouble with

965
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,980
is the time in the early days,

966
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,980
not in the later days.

967
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,980
So things have turned out later days

968
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,980
that teaching loads gradually began

969
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,980
to fall into a...

970
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,980
I don't want to put it.

971
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,980
A range that was consistent

972
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,980
with what we were being taught

973
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,980
at other institutions

974
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,980
with which we competed at that time.

975
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
So there was still a lot of teaching,

976
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,980
but it was of a kind that really lots of fun.

977
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,980
What was the environment like in the Department of Education?

978
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:01,980
Oh, it was very collegial.

979
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,980
Collegial was that the word.

980
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,980
We were all very friendly with one another.

981
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,980
I mean,

982
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,980
socially,

983
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,980
I had friends in physical chemistry

984
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,980
and organic chemistry,

985
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,980
and we saw one another

986
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,980
at analytical chemistry of dinner parties.

987
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,980
We did lots of things together.

988
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,980
New Year's Eve parties and so on.

989
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,980
So it was,

990
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,980
in my opinion,

991
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,980
a lot more cohesive than it is at the moment.

992
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,980
And at the time,

993
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
a lot more cohesive at Oregon State

994
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
than in many institutions.

995
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
In many institutions,

996
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:53,980
there is a kind of a very wary attitude

997
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
or outlook

998
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,980
from one divisional type to another.

999
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,980
And sometimes even within the members of the division,

1000
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,980
have to realize that

1001
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,980
university teaching

1002
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,980
university careers can be very competitive,

1003
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,980
especially those that depend

1004
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,980
to good deal on research that you do,

1005
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,980
as well as on your teaching.

1006
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,980
And so,

1007
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,980
you read about this all the time of the press

1008
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,980
of people that are competing for

1009
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,980
even publicly sometimes for priority

1010
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,980
and some major discovery.

1011
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,980
But we never had any of that in chemistry.

1012
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,980
We just had a very good time.

1013
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,980
That's been a fine place.

1014
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,980
I'm sorry.

1015
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,980
I'm sorry.

1016
01:00:52,980 --> 01:01:00,980
That was a history that is very interesting.

1017
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,980
Lisa decided,

1018
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,980
did I mention how we mapped?

1019
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,980
Yeah, well.

1020
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,980
When we came to the stage,

1021
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,980
she was the scientist,

1022
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,980
and we worked together at Caltech.

1023
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,980
She was actually paid at Caltech.

1024
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,980
And we worked in the lecture under fraction.

1025
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,980
They are both of us together in the same project.

1026
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,980
Did several things are.

1027
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,980
Then when we came to Oregon,

1028
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,980
she was very busy,

1029
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,980
of course, with our son,

1030
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,980
who was only three months old when we arrived.

1031
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,980
So she did no work at all at that point.

1032
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Except.

1033
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,980
Well, that's not quite true because we did manage

1034
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:55,980
to find some babysitting for a few hours a day

1035
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,980
now and then when she came to the university.

1036
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,980
But she was never away from home more than two or three hours

1037
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,980
at a time then.

1038
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:12,980
And that a couple of years later,

1039
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,980
our daughter was born.

1040
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,980
So then we had two kids at home.

1041
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,980
And so by and large, she worked only sporadically

1042
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,980
until the kids got into nursery school

1043
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,980
when she could then drive them up to,

1044
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,980
they were on orchard street here in the University of

1045
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,980
University School, which has changed its location,

1046
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,980
I think, somewhat.

1047
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,980
But the kids would go there.

1048
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,980
And she would come to the laboratory

1049
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,980
and then when there's such an issue,

1050
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
she'd take them up to home.

1051
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,980
And we live very close to the Jefferson School.

1052
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:51,980
So until both of them got into school,

1053
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,980
she was home most of the time.

1054
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:03,980
But managed to put in several hours per week

1055
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,980
working on our projects at that time.

1056
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,980
Then when the kids went to Jefferson School,

1057
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,980
she could, in the morning,

1058
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,980
and the kids would get dressed.

1059
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,980
I'd go off to work.

1060
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,980
Kids would get dressed.

1061
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,980
School would start.

1062
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,980
They would run out the front door, go over to school

1063
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:21,980
and we'd let the teachers know what phone to call.

1064
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,980
Then Lisa would get in the her car and drive over

1065
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,980
the University and we would work until about

1066
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,980
two or three years old.

1067
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,980
When she would get in the car and go home,

1068
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,980
park the car and get in the house.

1069
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,980
The kids would run out of the school and come back.

1070
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,980
They never knew.

1071
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,980
She actually worked because of the forest.

1072
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,980
They were concerned.

1073
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:42,980
She was there.

1074
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,980
When they left and there when they came home.

1075
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,980
But she was able to work about half time then.

1076
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:52,980
She was paid by a line on them.

1077
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,980
In the budget for grants,

1078
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,980
lives exceeded and getting.

1079
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,980
And then we also had joint grants.

1080
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,980
And then she's very good at mathematics.

1081
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,980
And she was hired as a,

1082
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,980
by the computer center to be working on.

1083
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,980
She was very good at programming and so on.

1084
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,980
And she was kind of a liaison with chemistry and programming

1085
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,980
in the computer center.

1086
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,980
And so we still had centralized computing.

1087
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,980
Then we had one rhubarb.

1088
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,980
I might as well tell you this.

1089
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,980
I haven't before.

1090
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,980
But it went something like this.

1091
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
Gilbert had retired.

1092
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:40,980
And Bart Christensen had become chairman.

1093
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,980
And Lisa had been working on my grant for the

1094
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,980
line item and the budget for her salary.

1095
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,980
And the proposal that had been department chairman

1096
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,980
have to sign up for proposal and.

1097
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,980
And so it was funded.

1098
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:03,980
And then he decided one time that.

1099
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,980
She could no longer work on the grant after her.

1100
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,980
After the present year was over academic year.

1101
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,980
And so she wrote him a letter and pointed out that she had.

1102
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:22,980
Item for a salary was never explained what the reason was.

1103
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,980
And he responded and she wrote again and he didn't respond.

1104
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,980
It turned out in retrospect that he was greatly afraid.

1105
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,980
That there would be some negative feeling about.

1106
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,980
A man and wife working together.

1107
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,980
In the chemistry department.

1108
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,980
Because at that time there were.

1109
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,980
I was not on herdo.

1110
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,980
But it was a little unusual.

1111
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,980
The thing on she was not being paid on state funds at all.

1112
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,980
And she was an expert on the field.

1113
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,980
And which there were no other.

1114
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,980
West on the Mississippi.

1115
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,980
You see.

1116
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Well.

1117
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
He persisted in this.

1118
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,980
So we finally went over to.

1119
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,980
Together to the.

1120
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:09,980
Dean.

1121
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
Who was virtual on.

1122
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,980
At that time.

1123
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,980
And.

1124
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:16,980
Said.

1125
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,980
I knew him very well from years.

1126
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,980
I said, we're in look.

1127
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,980
This is a situation.

1128
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,980
He said, well, why didn't you tell me this before.

1129
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,980
I said, well, this Lisa said this to you know.

1130
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
Well, we were going through channels.

1131
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,980
Our issue was not with you.

1132
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,980
So he looked at this and he says, well, he says.

1133
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,980
She can certainly work on the grant.

1134
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,980
The proposal, mother, I had been signed by Bert.

1135
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:49,980
And now he was refusing to continue her funding even though he has signed the agreement.

1136
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,980
So he overturned this.

1137
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:56,980
But then he said.

1138
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,980
If Lisa wants to work in the future, she'll have to have her name on the grant.

1139
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,980
Not just worked on your grant.

1140
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,980
Well, I can't remember much of the details following that.

1141
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,980
But it turned out that.

1142
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,980
Prisons one was about to retire.

1143
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,980
There were circumstances here that I don't need to go into.

1144
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,980
But anyway, he was going to retire.

1145
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,980
And a new one man was going to come.

1146
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,980
And I was on a national committee at the time.

1147
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,980
And I was a former friend of mine at Caltech named Dave Schumacher.

1148
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,980
It was on the same committee.

1149
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,980
And Dave and I mentioned to him.

1150
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,980
He was from Idaho, of course.

1151
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
And going to recolage.

1152
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,980
We've gone to Caltech together.

1153
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,980
You finished a little earlier than I did.

1154
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,980
That's a day.

1155
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,980
Would you, we need a new department, Sherman.

1156
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,980
He was chairman of the committee.

1157
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,980
I was on I saw how good he was at a ministering thing.

1158
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:03,980
Would you, of by any criteria, even consider coming back.

1159
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,980
Maybe being considered as our department chairman.

1160
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,980
And there was a lot of talk about this.

1161
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,980
He decided that, yes, he might like that.

1162
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,980
He was at MIT at the time.

1163
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,980
So we invited him out.

1164
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,980
And he was off for the job.

1165
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,980
And he liked Oregon.

1166
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,980
And he went to school in Portland.

1167
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:33,980
But one of the criteria for him coming was that his wife would be able to work.

1168
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,980
Here was another man on wife team.

1169
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,980
She was a cross-logger for his he was.

1170
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,980
And McFicker was the chairman of this time.

1171
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:49,980
And one of the conditions for him coming was that his wife would be allowed to work.

1172
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:54,980
And then he said, oh, by the way, he says, you know, can't at least they have the same problem.

1173
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:59,980
And so McFicker came around today.

1174
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,980
He says, that's no problem.

1175
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
He says, I've looked this all up.

1176
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:09,980
He says, two members of the same family cannot work.

1177
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:18,980
Not only in the same department or same institution, but in the same entire system of higher education.

1178
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,980
Except under unusual circumstances.

1179
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,980
And he said, this is McFicker's words.

1180
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,980
Dave relayed them to me.

1181
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:35,980
He said, I regard a man on wife scientific team as an unusual circumstance.

1182
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,980
So Dave came.

1183
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,980
His wife was allowed to work with him.

1184
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:48,980
And at the same time, Lisa was allowed to work with me.

1185
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:53,980
The really remarkable and most interesting thing about this,

1186
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:59,980
there was one small attempt to cover the tracks here.

1187
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:06,980
And that was that Clara Schumacher had the, was responsible to me.

1188
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,980
And Lisa was responsible to Dave for monitoring purposes.

1189
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:18,980
But of course, Dave came around and said, well, he said, how is Lisa doing fine?

1190
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,980
And I said, then he says, how's Clara doing?

1191
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,980
I said, oh fine.

1192
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:26,980
So that was the monitoring.

1193
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:31,980
And of course, that all disappeared on the end.

1194
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:36,980
But in retrospect, it's pretty funny.

1195
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,980
So that's how we were able to continue.

1196
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,980
So Lisa did a lot of computer work.

1197
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,980
Pardon?

1198
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,980
Lisa did a lot of computer work?

1199
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,980
Oh, well, yeah.

1200
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,980
But not just computer work.

1201
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:53,980
She's a special expert in programming.

1202
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:58,980
Yeah, that is evolved during the ages that we've been here.

1203
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:06,980
But she is responsible for all the basic materials that we use in our research even today.

1204
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:13,980
Some of these programs have been modified by others and even added to by others.

1205
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:24,980
But the basic thing, she is responsible for.

1206
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,980
That's very funny.

1207
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Can you reflect on their early days of using computers in your work?

1208
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,980
Computers on work?

1209
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,980
Yeah, well.

1210
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,980
Yes.

1211
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:58,980
When I left Caltech, we had some IBM office machines, and we were able to operate them using IBM

1212
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,980
punched cards.

1213
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:06,980
We had a very, for the time, very efficient system for doing the calculations and necessary

1214
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,980
for our work in electron production.

1215
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:19,980
When I came to Oregon State, we didn't have this IBM set up here at all.

1216
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:31,980
But the mathematics department had managed to the applied aspect of mathematics here,

1217
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:42,980
the very interested in computers, and the central computer by IBM had been developed

1218
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:48,980
a few years earlier, and there was a computer that they managed to buy in mathematics.

1219
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,980
It was called an all-wak-3E.

1220
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,980
They sold a few of these things, and we had one here.

1221
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,980
He was set up and running in mathematics and the basement.

1222
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,980
It was a tube machine.

1223
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:09,980
I mean, it was a huge thing with tapes and vacuum tubes.

1224
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,980
Transistors hadn't been invented yet.

1225
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:18,980
At least we're not available in a device like this.

1226
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:22,980
And so we wrote together.

1227
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,980
I did programming when I first came here.

1228
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:30,980
There was no compiler for this machine, so we had to write things in machine language.

1229
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:35,980
And I learned enough to do that and wrote the very earliest programs in machine language

1230
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:39,980
that run on the all-wak-3E.

1231
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:46,980
Well, they all-wak-3E as our analytical scheme improved.

1232
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:58,980
The programs got more and more lengthy as far as that machine was concerned.

1233
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,980
The machine, by this time, was beginning to teach her a bit.

1234
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:10,980
And there were some graduate students over there on mathematics that managed to know what tubes

1235
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,980
to interchange and exchange and for the keep this thing running.

1236
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,980
But we had to write our early programs in such a way.

1237
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:25,980
We couldn't rely on the machine because it would make errors due to fully hardware.

1238
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:32,980
And so we wrote our programs in such a way that we could run them twice.

1239
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,980
And if we got the same answer, we could continue to the next stage.

1240
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:45,980
And these are my wrote those programs.

1241
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:51,980
Then after a while, and by the way, I had some money on the use of the machine you had to pay.

1242
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:59,980
So I, at one stage, gave them a few hundred dollars from one of my grants

1243
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,980
against future computing.

1244
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,980
So they could buy a vacuum tubes to put into this machine.

1245
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:11,980
Believe it or not.

1246
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:16,980
Harvard Loan Seth was a chairman of mathematics at that time.

1247
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,980
Very nice guy.

1248
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:28,980
So a couple of years later, it turned out that statistics had gotten whole of an IBM machine.

1249
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:34,980
It was running on punch cards, but it had a compiler and so on and so we moved to that.

1250
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,980
That was a central computer.

1251
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,980
They charged also.

1252
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:45,980
But it was a much better machine in the 1410, I think it was called.

1253
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,980
And then things progressed around here.

1254
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,980
We were still doing central computing.

1255
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,980
There was a central computing center that was set up.

1256
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,980
And they bought a CDC machine.

1257
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:03,980
And that CDC machine was better still faster.

1258
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:16,980
And by this time, we had altered our programming so that we could access the machine remotely through a telephone line.

1259
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,980
And we had a teletime terminal in the laboratory.

1260
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:27,980
So on data from our experiments could be put out on punch paper tape.

1261
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:33,980
And that punch paper tape could be fed into our terminal and carried over to the computer.

1262
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:36,980
We thought this was why we were really ahead of things there.

1263
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,980
It was great.

1264
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:46,980
Then it turned out that was heavy demand for that machine.

1265
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:50,980
And the amount of storage we needed for some of our programs was huge.

1266
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,980
And they didn't have enough of that, say.

1267
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,980
So we were limited.

1268
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:00,980
And to how much storage we could use in any of our programs.

1269
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:11,980
So these are very, very cleverly took our biggest, most demanding programs and created it to operate with overlays.

1270
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:17,980
So that instead of saving something, she determined what would be needed and wrote the program.

1271
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:21,980
So succeeding stages could write right over this stuff.

1272
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:29,980
And so this occurred in that way, the program became very efficient as far as space was concerned.

1273
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,980
And then we still needed space.

1274
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,980
So I talked to them over there and they said, oh well, you can have more space after the hours of such and such.

1275
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:44,980
So we would set our stuff to run on this machine at a later time.

1276
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:53,980
Then of course, that was the time that Lisa, one of the times when Lisa was hired to be working over there.

1277
01:17:53,980 --> 01:18:01,980
Then the central computing of course began to gradually disappear as a PCs came in.

1278
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:12,980
And right away, well, before that happened in chemistry, we determined that we needed a computer locally.

1279
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:20,980
And we managed to get a grant, several of us, pulled our knowledge and resources later proposal.

1280
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,980
And we were able to buy our VACs.

1281
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,980
And Lisa then converted all our programs to run on the VACs.

1282
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,980
And that was tremendous.

1283
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,980
And we have lots of programs including plotting ones.

1284
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:37,980
We had a plotter, also worked just fine.

1285
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:47,980
And then of course, the VACs began to be phased out.

1286
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:58,980
And we had a PDP 11 in our laboratory, finally, Lisa and me.

1287
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:04,980
And some of our stuff was ran on that.

1288
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:08,980
But this was all very closely stuff.

1289
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:18,980
And the PDP 11 used large disks like this, you know, floppy disks that were eight inches or ten inches in diameter.

1290
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,980
Then PCs began to appear on the scene.

1291
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:34,980
And so, at one stage or another, I could see that there was going to be no expertise around the hall or do anything about PDP 11's.

1292
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,980
Everything was going to be going to PCs.

1293
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:46,980
So if we wanted to keep current and not be high and dry, that if something happened to the PDE 11, nobody would know what to do.

1294
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:51,980
So we converted all of our stuff to run on PCs.

1295
01:19:51,980 --> 01:20:01,980
And all of our data, all through the years, had been stored on these disks on the PDP 11.

1296
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:20,980
Well, we hired a guy to convert all of the stuff on the PDE 11 onto disks that could in a format that can be used on a smaller, well smaller,

1297
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:28,980
but faster PCs.

1298
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,980
And these were all on floppy disks like this.

1299
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,980
Well, pretty almost disappeared.

1300
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,980
And we had to convert them to some other medium.

1301
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:44,980
And so we took all of this stuff and copied them all over on the CDs that are now like this.

1302
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,980
And I have a host of things on CDs.

1303
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:54,980
But also a whole pile of stuff on these floppys.

1304
01:20:54,980 --> 01:21:02,980
All cataloged and I've maintained a couple of the PCs in my laboratory.

1305
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:07,980
A floppy disk drive that will still accept these old ones.

1306
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,980
There's no reason to change it to anything else.

1307
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:17,980
But now we're going to extremely fast computers.

1308
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:27,980
A calculation on the all-wack 3E would take us two days we can now do in about 10 seconds, something like that.

1309
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,980
And there's so fast now on the storage, it's so enormous.

1310
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:35,980
I can get a program going in a little hit return.

1311
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:40,980
I can't get my hands on my lap before all the information is on the screen again.

1312
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,980
It's been a total revolution.

1313
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:56,980
Well, in the midst of all this, some place back we had a special tectronics scope, which could feed data in would plot things for us.

1314
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,980
We could see it on the screen there.

1315
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:07,980
And my son later went on to a electric engineering degree and it's Stanford.

1316
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:13,980
And as a software engineer at Microsoft, now when he was in high school he loved these computers.

1317
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:17,980
And he could program also.

1318
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:24,980
And so he played it, believe it or not, a big role in some of the very early developing.

1319
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:29,980
When he was at Stanford, he would come home and say, well, what do you need now down?

1320
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:34,980
Still interested in that.

1321
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:41,980
I should say one other thing, our kids were kind of interested in science.

1322
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:48,980
And so Eric and Lisa and I published a paper together on work that he had actually worked on the laboratory.

1323
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:53,980
And this is a paper by had bird had bird and had bird and had bird.

1324
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:59,980
And it was published in the journal of chemical physics.

1325
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:03,980
And a few years later, my daughter was interested in we published a paper.

1326
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,980
Another one by had bird had bird and had bird.

1327
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:11,980
And I never managed to get the two kids to the laboratory at the same time.

1328
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:17,980
So we could have four had birds on it.

1329
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:26,980
One time I called up the journal editor of chemical physics.

1330
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:32,980
Well, man named Willard Stout, way back when I said, this is Ken Hedberg.

1331
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,980
And he said, oh, of Hedberg, Hedberg and Hedberg.

1332
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,980
Apparently, he had noticed this.

1333
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:46,980
So anyway, that's more or less the story of computing.

1334
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:53,980
Okay, well, the last question for today, I'd like you when we were at your office, we've seen the final folders.

1335
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,980
And you can explain what the final folders are.

1336
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,980
So we have an agenda.

1337
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:00,980
But the final folders are.

1338
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:05,980
There are several stages in the analysis of a structure.

1339
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:15,980
And they begin with the raw data that we get from using this micro-densitometer.

1340
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:20,980
It's a tomator on the films or plates.

1341
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,980
And these raw data are the first things that go into the folder.

1342
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:31,980
Now, a lot of things have to be done to that raw data.

1343
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:41,980
Because after all, you're taking what is a continuous curve and you're sampling it at very small intervals along it.

1344
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,980
So you have points that correspond to this.

1345
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:56,980
Now, when this density plate or film moves across the densitometer, it goes across the middle and back out on the other side.

1346
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:02,980
So we scan the film from one side to the other.

1347
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:10,980
But all the time it's rotating, which means that half of the film should be identical to the other half of the trace.

1348
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,980
It should be identical to the other half.

1349
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,980
But since you're sampling by points, you can't make sure that these points are identical.

1350
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:23,980
So you have to do something as we define the center.

1351
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:29,980
So we have a program that compares the two sides of this and determines where the center is.

1352
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,980
And then it takes the data on one side and that on the other.

1353
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:39,980
And interpolates if necessary between the points adds them all together to give you a scan.

1354
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,980
That's all in their finding the center.

1355
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,980
So we have the curve in counts.

1356
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,980
We have the curve curves that find the center.

1357
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,980
And then we have the data we're just just numbers.

1358
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,980
We want to convert them to something which has a common basis.

1359
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:08,980
And because of the properties of the densitometer, a very black film can give you the same range of numbers that are very light-filled.

1360
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:13,980
But there's obviously a lot more scattering in one than in the other.

1361
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:24,980
So we have a way of converting these information to let us call it absolute densities.

1362
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:35,980
It's not really that, but it really puts the two curves on the same scale in terms of darkness and so on.

1363
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:44,980
Then we have a number of programs that are designed to convert this.

1364
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:52,980
There is a difference between the blackness of the film and the intensity of the scattering.

1365
01:26:52,980 --> 01:27:04,980
Now you can get a sense of this where, for example, if you take a film and expose it for a second,

1366
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,980
you get a certain darkness.

1367
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,980
Suppose it for two seconds, you get another darkness.

1368
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:17,980
And of course, if in the right range, the blackness of the second would be,

1369
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:23,980
if you expose twice as long under identical condition, the blackness would be twice as great.

1370
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:28,980
Well, clearly, the longer you expose the less the photographic film is going to respond.

1371
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:32,980
So pretty soon it gets black and it doesn't matter how long you expose.

1372
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,980
So it goes, not again, a blacker.

1373
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:41,980
So the curve that relates blackness to intensity is not linear.

1374
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:49,980
We have to find out how long, we know how long linear it is in terms of how dark the film is.

1375
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,980
So we have corrections for that.

1376
01:27:51,980 --> 01:28:01,980
We have a whole host of corrections that are built into this that is designed to take the data from the film and put it into a form.

1377
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:15,980
Which compares with mathematically with a theoretical function that we can calculate.

1378
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,980
And there are many steps in this process.

1379
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:24,980
Each one of these steps builds up to this point.

1380
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:31,980
And then when we've got all of that, we then have.

1381
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:38,980
We do a number of calculations.

1382
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,980
The most important of which is the final fitting procedure.

1383
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:47,980
And it's called the least squares adjustment.

1384
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:55,980
And so this is a program that fits the final model to the experimental data.

1385
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:05,980
And the results of that is an output in the folder that shows the fitting quality of this.

1386
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:10,980
And then there are often plots of the curves at various stages of this procedure.

1387
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:16,980
So it all goes into the line printer output, which those days we call the final folder.

1388
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,980
And it might be anywhere from two inches thick.

1389
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:24,980
Well, anywhere from an inch thick to three inches thick side.

1390
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,980
And that's what you saw on those line printer folders.

1391
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:31,980
Now we have almost the same thing nowadays.

1392
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:38,980
But it is all done on eight and a half by 11 stuff you see.

1393
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,980
When we're doing a hard copy that we want to look at.

1394
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:52,980
But now we actually put all this stuff on a disk on a CD.

1395
01:29:52,980 --> 01:30:00,980
And it's all we have folders on the computer for molecules that contain all the information we want.

1396
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,980
And some folders and some folders.

1397
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:09,980
And I take these the major folder and I'll just copy the whole thing over onto a CD.

1398
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:13,980
And I'll give it a name for the molecule and everything we want.

1399
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,980
Now we can put on this CD.

1400
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,980
Look in there.

1401
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,980
We can find it right away.

1402
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:24,980
So it's the hard copy stuff that you saw on the laboratory.

1403
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:33,980
Really is stuff that we stopped generating maybe 20 years ago.

1404
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:44,980
And the later stuff is all in either in folders or on hard copy or on devices like CDs.

1405
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:49,980
I read recently, somebody was saying CDs are going to disappear also.

1406
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,980
So maybe it'll all be on a thumb drive now.

1407
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:56,980
Who knows.

1408
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:00,980
Okay, what we've been going for an hour and a half is always the holiday today.

1409
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:01,980
All right?

1410
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,980
Good.

1411
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,980
All right.
