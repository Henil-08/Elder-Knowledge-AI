1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
Okay, so we are doing so as in the past few years you just have to get things in.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:17,760
My name is Kenneth Hedberg and this is a 20th of October 19th of 2011.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay, so yeah, I would like to start with you telling us about the role that you played

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,760
in the following papers telling you what you say.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Yeah, well, we talked about that last time, I guess.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Did we have to be known as, oh no, well, I have a comfortable feeling on repeating myself

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,960
here, but maybe not, the effort to bring the papers here began when I sat at the head table with

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:05,840
the Helm Paul enduring a meeting short in celebration of the awardee of the Pauling award,

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,080
which had been newly set up by three sections of the American Chemical Society.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,000
And she told me at that time that people, several universities and other institutions were

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,080
after Linus's papers, but she said, he didn't want them to go to these institutions.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,280
She said, they didn't want all of his papers and the University of Pennsylvania, I've seen your

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,360
remember as one of them, as well as Caltech and Stanford, they only wanted to select proportions,

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,960
but they wanted them all together, and so she said to me that she had felt for a long time

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,840
that the papers ought to come to Oregon State. Now, this was before pulling relations with Oregon State

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,760
had been repaired, and she went on to remark that she'd been talking to him and she was trying

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:10,560
to persuade him that he should let bygones be bygones. So that was that Linus later.

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,840
Oh gosh, that was the early 60s. I'm sorry, my memory is easy on these exact dates,

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,520
but anyway, sometimes there. So I conveyed this information when I got back to the

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:43,200
institution to President of the University, with that time was a Johnson. He called me and asked me

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,600
if I thought that pulling would accept an invitation to come to the University of

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:58,240
Spain speak. And I said, well, it could well be the case that doesn't do any harm to try.

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,600
Now, have I outlined the reasons before? Well, the pulling did not want to come to the

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:15,680
institution. Well, I thought we talked about that. That's odd because, well, never mind.

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,600
In the late 40s, there was a faculty member at Oregon State, named Ralph Spitzer,

26
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,040
who was denied tenure in the Department of Chemistry. He was an excellent physical chemist,

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,640
and he raised the issue that he was being fired for his political beliefs, found that

28
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:50,160
partly on a letter that he had written that was published in chemical and engineering news,

29
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,680
not supporting, but at least saying that people ought to at least think about what this

30
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,000
fellow single, and at that time, the Soviet Union was saying about the effect of

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,760
environmental inheritance. And of course, it's included in the face of conventional wisdom of

32
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:25,520
the time that everything was inherited. So at any rate, the faculty of the chemistry department,

33
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,520
decided that they would not offer him permanent tenure, which meant, of course, that he had to leave.

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Now, I knew all the members of the chemistry department having given an undergraduate here,

35
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,320
consequence of those was that Ralph Spitzer asked the American Chemical Society for hearing

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,200
the issue of, forgotten what the ECS committee was, but anyway,

37
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,280
the idea is that you're not supposed to be discharged from a teaching position on grounds

38
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,600
of your political beliefs. And at the 1948 meeting of American Chemical Society in San Francisco,

39
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,600
which I attended, Ralph made his case, and he was strongly supported by Linus Pauling.

40
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,440
The Upsolu always was that I don't think the ECS committee wanted to get its hands

41
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,000
to deeply involved in this thing and not much ever came of it, but Pauling was rather actively

42
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,920
pursuing an ocean that Spitzer was a fine scientist, and it could be no reason that he shouldn't be

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,240
kept on for a professional reasons. Well, Al Strand was president of Oregon State at that time,

44
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:05,360
and the news media, or some media made it, well, there's knowledge of what Pauling had said,

45
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,200
and Strand got properly angry and said, well, Oregon State can get along without Linus Pauling.

46
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,720
And Linus Pauling, then, said to the media, when this was reported to him, if they can get along,

47
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,200
about Linus Pauling, they will. So from 1948 to all through the 50s, and of course, they won

48
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:36,160
as Nobel Prize in 1954, and these pies laid around. Yeah, nothing to do with Oregon State.

49
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,560
But after Mrs. Pauling's comment to me, and my relay of this information of Johnson, he called me and said,

50
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:54,560
what, as I said before, I would call him except an invitation. And due course, this was tendered to him, and he agreed.

51
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,360
But he was going to come here, and he was not going to speak, he's going to speak to the university as a whole,

52
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:13,760
not going to speak to a chemistry department on scientific subject. So there was a huge meeting held in the present,

53
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:27,120
guilty, I'll see him. And there was a podium set up on one side of the floor, and Strands were filled on the opposite side,

54
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:37,280
as his kind of a stage. And the head of time, Johnson, excuse me, asked me if I would introduce Pauling.

55
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,760
Well, if you think about that, here's a distinguished scientist coming to speak to the university,

56
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,280
and the present of the university is not introducing him, an ordinary faculty member like me was asked to do so.

57
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:07,280
Well, in my presence, Pauling, and I, and Johnson and maybe some other people were there, Johnson and Pauling,

58
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
that I was going to introduce him, and he turned to me, and he said, you're going to introduce me,

59
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,280
can, and I said, yes, he's asked me to do that. Pauling didn't say a word, but it was perfectly clear,

60
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,560
but he felt that it was appropriate for the university president to do the introduction.

61
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Well, so anyway, all of Mrs. Johnson and President Johnson and either Hill and Pauling and Lioness and Lisa,

62
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,440
and I got in the limo, and we're sure for over to the whole same. And everybody was sitting there waiting,

63
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,880
we filed in and went up on the stage, and a few things were said, and then I rose to give my introduction,

64
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,600
which I did in a few minutes and about this time, this is Pauling was about to speak in a file,

65
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:03,040
the group of students, they were all black, and many prominent among them were many members of the football team.

66
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,680
And this is at the time, when the great punk and the degree that football players were not going to be able to wear beers,

67
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:25,680
and at that point all hell broke loose, and there were meetings on the campus regarding free speech and the ability of the students to put both hand and have a personal care,

68
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,680
and so as they wished, and the great punk and assisted that, he finally resulted, I think, to say,

69
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:44,080
that the beers didn't fit very well with a helmet and so on. And anyway, in due course, these people, they set a few words,

70
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:53,680
and then they turned on a abruptly filed out, and very well behaved, and so Pauling gave his speech,

71
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,680
which was on peace, and very well received, and so on. And then at a dinner that evening,

72
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:11,280
Pauling said to me, she said, oh, I was so surprised, she said, I thought all these blacks that had filed in,

73
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:22,000
with her, where they were going to sing. Oh, well, that was the beginning of several

74
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,840
lectures to Pauling. He came back on succeeding occasions, but in the middle of all of us,

75
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,920
well, not in the middle, but I think at the beginning of all of us, I had reported to Johnson

76
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,920
that Pauling thought that Melanos's paper should come to Oregon State, and of course, that would have been a great coup,

77
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:53,920
and so he, gingerly, boasts the subject to Pauling. I wrote him a letter about this, actually,

78
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:05,120
and Pauling, in due course, responded and saying that, oh, he would give it some thought that he was not yet prepared to give up his papers,

79
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,760
because he was still actively using the materials that were in them. And after Johnson retired,

80
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:29,120
he was succeeded by the picker, and I didn't think to great deal about this, Pauling was now coming and going,

81
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,320
in a case, and then suddenly occurred to me that I should follow the information that I had given to Johnson to him as well.

82
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,320
So I dug out the correspondence letter that I had written, and President Johnson's response to it

83
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,040
and typed another letter and sent it off to Dr. McPickery. Well, this scenario was repeated,

84
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,640
and he, again, occurred Pauling on his paper. This was now some several years later after the first overture,

85
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,120
but he got the same response back. Pauling wasn't yet ready to park for these papers.

86
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:18,880
And time went on, and John Bern making President. And once or down, I hold out these papers,

87
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,480
now I'll have two sets of correspondence and wrote the John, sent it off to him.

88
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,240
And his response was a little bit different, immediately set up a committee on which I served,

89
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,160
and he made a concrete offer to Linus Pauling at the others having it. He said,

90
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,200
we are very, I'm paraphrasing him now. You could talk to John and find out exactly how this went,

91
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:54,080
but the gist of it was that he said that they would create it, and they would not just

92
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,720
set up a room or something or create a special collections in which he could, all of his papers

93
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:09,600
could be housed. They would build this for him. I think you see, I only see these facts from

94
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,200
what I remember of our contacts, but I should be checked with John.

95
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,200
Remember the committee was Rob Phillips and some others who may can't remember now.

96
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,640
But anyway, this went on, and this time Pauling agreed. This is what would transpire,

97
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,200
but he wanted also other homes papers to come as well. He strongly felt always liked that after

98
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,280
he had won the peace prize that she should have shared it, because she was the one that actually

99
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:56,880
stimulated his activity in that area. Well, there was a huge, a huge degree to do this.

100
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,960
The first thing that he did was supply to the university, and you'll know all this and the

101
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:11,600
records of the Special Collections. He sent the copies of the signatures to the proposal for

102
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:21,040
the way of all the petition for banning exploding explosion of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere,

103
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,960
atmospheric test bands. And that was the first thing I believed that came to the Oregon State.

104
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,880
And only graduated the other materials appear still, because of course,

105
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,200
when I was Pauling was acting until shortly before his death.

106
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,680
And I remember, excuse me, people here were not

107
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:57,440
to clear about how big this collection of Pauling was. And so, the due course of the university

108
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,280
suggested our Paulings suggested that they come down and take a look at what he had.

109
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:15,440
And the Christian Dorothy was sent down. And he came back and told me,

110
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,400
I'd kind of cross as far as I should be, since there were over 90 filing cases.

111
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,400
Now, in that big circle, we're falling head as ranch. You see, all the stuff had been moved

112
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:34,000
down there. And he said, Christian Dorothy was just totally blown away by all of this.

113
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:46,400
Well, in due course, after Pauling had agreed to give his papers, there was a very, very

114
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,880
elegant reception and Portland with several speakers and lavish dinner.

115
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:05,360
It was really a very, very nice affair and Pauling spoke. And that stage,

116
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:15,840
somehow the question came up about all of his materials coming here and there had been some

117
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:27,440
of the family members, particularly Linda, I think, who felt that the family should have held

118
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,800
control over some of these, and Pauling was asked, well, what does your family think about all

119
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,080
this? And he says, well, Linda's here, why don't you ask her? I don't remember what a response was,

120
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:46,640
but I do remember Pauling's statement very clearly. Well, as time went on,

121
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,160
these things began to arrive, these filing cases, now remember, I'm not sure,

122
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,520
describing to me a truck and pull up and disclosure to these filing cases and so on.

123
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:10,000
And that was a start and we had that saw the project through to completion. I don't know

124
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,720
when the last of these materials actually arrived here in special collections, but that's kind of

125
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,480
the history of how they came here, at least of the role that I played in and doing nothing but

126
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,800
reminding one person and after another of what Pauling had, what Mrs. Pauling had urged

127
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,480
and to do in the fact that the relations have been repaired, send it between the university and

128
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:44,240
the last Paulings and the suggested things might go smoothly forward from there. I do know that

129
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,080
he was actually very fond of the university, but he came on business, which he did not

130
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:04,400
infrequently, I usually somehow involved in escorting him around walking the campus with him

131
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,000
and a number of occasions we walked around campus for one time, we walked up in the old

132
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,480
who was in those days known as a chem shock and then quite seriously remodeled from Pauling's

133
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
time, but he seemed to be able to pick out the room in which he had been lecturing when they

134
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,960
even Helen Pauling had appeared in his life. And we walked down 15th street, and he showed me a house

135
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:40,000
there that he had lived in as a student and I said to him, it's rather surprising.

136
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,840
It was a certain parallelism in our experience here because I lived on 15th street also only

137
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,720
on the other side of the street just to have a block down when I was an undergraduate student.

138
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:01,520
So I took a picture of him and Linda on the steps of the house. I have it somewhere in my materials at home.

139
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:20,880
So, the other thing I would say is that when Pauling began to come back to Oregon State on

140
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:29,680
occasions, we saw him in his life as long as she was living quite frequently at home for dinner

141
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,720
and places and things like that. So we got to know them pretty well, better than when I was a student.

142
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,560
Of course when I was a Celtic as a student, I was a student. I was a student. I was a student.

143
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,280
So it has been for me a wonderful exhilarating experience.

144
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,280
So does that answer your query? I've spent 20 minutes describing it.

145
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,320
Well, I'm interested in not very giving it a memory of giving it a memory of the times that

146
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,920
either home and minus become an engineer and you have to remember.

147
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:19,200
Oh yeah, sure, I have, I have, I keep thinking that I have said

148
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:30,160
some of this to you before, but it may have been to somebody else, but let me think just a moment.

149
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,160
One time, this is an a music anecdote and I don't know whether it involved Rob folks,

150
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,440
but I don't have the host laws for a dinner party that the Paulings and we were invited to

151
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
along with Dave Schumacher, who was chairman of our department and who, by the way,

152
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,640
in Pauling very well. He was a student at Caltech when I was and we all knew that Pauling

153
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:17,920
and he didn't shy away from alcohol, he liked the vodka and on the evening of the dinner party

154
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:25,520
and just before about four o'clock, I got a call from the host. Sorry about my throat

155
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:34,800
asking me, I know the Dr. Pauling likes vodka since I looked at my cupboard and I don't have any

156
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,000
and I don't have any way of getting it. Do you happen to have any vodka? And I said,

157
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,400
well, as a matter of fact, I do. Am I told this story? No, well, I sort of met a fact I do,

158
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,480
so I went into my cupboard and I had maybe two thirds of a bottle there and so I got a brown

159
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,960
paper bag and put the bottle in it and then we were picked up and the Paulings were picked up

160
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:10,640
and we were driven up to the whole house, Ryan Dorbell and he appeared and everybody shook hands

161
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,720
of he and it is why I've greeted everyone most closely and as I walked in I had a dim my paper bag

162
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,480
and put that bottle in it and then everybody settled down for a bit and living room before dinner

163
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
was served and the whole said, well, what anybody like a drink and Dr. Pauling said, well,

164
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,800
you don't happen to have any vodka to you and the whole said, well, as a matter of fact, I do.

165
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,840
So I thought that was that story I think is very funny on retrospect and then he wrote

166
00:22:48,960 --> 00:23:04,880
I never told Pauling this is true at all. So I have to read Helen died, he continued to come

167
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:14,960
to Oregon State, often with Linda as a company dim and they would come, there were lots of things

168
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:22,480
up at the University of Reception Zero, there was a big library reception one time and there were

169
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,320
seminars in chemistry and even in physics and then usually after these affairs and before dinner

170
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,560
well, I say usually that often at any rate, he and Linda would come to the house and

171
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:55,600
one occasion I'm referring still, he's enjoyment of a drink before dinner, he came down.

172
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,360
We were on the campus walking around and I said, what would you like to do now before the next

173
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,160
reception which is a hour and a half life? Is this as well? Can we go to your house for a drink?

174
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,320
Can I say yes? We could, so we went over to my house and he said, you don't happen to have any vodka?

175
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,440
I said, yeah, I kind of thought, I know you like that. And so I got a glass, a small cup of

176
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,480
liquor, put some ice in it and he drank a drink straight vodka and it's essentially pure alcohol,

177
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,520
you know, and he told me at one other occasion before dinner, he always said one of these

178
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,200
cocktails what that was about it. So I opened the glass and started to pour and I said, say,

179
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,160
well, he didn't say well and the thing was full, I stopped and he looked out and he wrote a smile.

180
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,040
There was a lot of ice in it so it really wasn't an awful lot of vodka, I think, at any rate,

181
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,480
we chatted a while and then he said to me, can I have another? And Linda was sitting there and

182
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
they had to go with this as a time, we had to go to reception over here in the library,

183
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,880
someplace or another, a library reception but it was held in the M.U. and one of the rooms at the

184
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,400
M.U. And anyway, he says, can I have another vodka? I'll put some more ice in it and pour it again

185
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,320
and once again, I stopped when I was full and Linda was over there and said, daddy, daddy, you shouldn't

186
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,040
do that, you've got to go to a reception. Well, he just smiled out and then we got up and walked out

187
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,200
and he walked straight as a rod, he didn't waver at all, we got in the car, we're over there and

188
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,280
he walked in and he shook hands with people, you couldn't tell and you know, he didn't weigh

189
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:49,920
an awful lot, he probably weighed 165 pounds or 60 pounds or something, he's a tall man and

190
00:25:49,920 --> 00:26:02,080
loose jointed as everybody knows it and that the reception will not just find. At one dinner party,

191
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,960
we had a misappalling with still alive, we tried to set it up in a nice fashion, we had

192
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,800
another, there were the Paulings and Lisa and me and another couple of me, I've been

193
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:28,320
two more, maybe eight people, but we had a first course with some white wine and I brought out the

194
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,960
bottle of them and poured the wine on, wine has picked up the bottle, what does it say? Oh, he says, yeah,

195
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:43,520
this is, I can't pronounce this, well, we say and he says, that's the same wine you served us last year,

196
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,200
but why he would remember of all of the dinner parties, it's been to what wine we had saved him

197
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:02,400
at a dinner party a year before, beats me, but anyway, that was his remark, it's been great fun knowing

198
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,280
and so does that answer your question about the papers and so on? I want to ask you about the

199
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,320
she makers if we have their questions, yes, I should like to tell you, you've ever seen it abroad,

200
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,320
what do you call it and what they're like, there's people in this thing. Oh, well, Dave's

201
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:28,480
you maker and I were close friends and when they reserved on a national committee together,

202
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:41,040
the United States, the American Crystalographic Association has a committee on which, well,

203
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,320
at any rate, we have a meeting to which I travel in Washington DC and Dave's you maker was a

204
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,960
chairman of this committee, well, he and I had been students at Caltech and I knew him very well,

205
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,320
and at the end, before I left, we were looking for a replacement for a Burke Christmas and

206
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:12,000
who is retiring and there was some talk given about bringing in, in fact, it was preferred to

207
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,640
bring in an outside person and I was a press of how Dave, who is an MIT, is professor of chemistry

208
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,360
and a crystalographer, ran this meeting, he's very efficient, I thought, hey, he'd be a good

209
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:35,840
chairman and so the meeting was one run under a very, very tight schedule we had, we worked

210
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,640
furiously for several hours and then people had to disband and they were not having a dinner,

211
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,880
they were going to go home so I had almost, I said, Dave, I'm going to talk to you and he said,

212
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
well, he says, you know, I got to catch a train and so that's not such a time but he says,

213
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm on the way to the restaurant, let's go to the restaurant. There, well, this may sound

214
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,440
an delicate and when you play it back again, but there we were on a pair of urinals,

215
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
which were at an angle to each other, so we were somehow facing each other and I outlined this

216
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,040
situation to him and asked him if he would consider, I think about being considered as department

217
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:22,080
chairman, of course Dave grew up in Idaho, went to read college so he loved the west and although

218
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,240
MIT was a very prestigious institution and they had a summer house, he had a plower up in

219
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:41,520
the mountains, he said, yes, he would think about it. So he came out and people liked him and

220
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,520
he was off for the job, well, one of the conditions for the job from his point of view was that

221
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,480
his wife Clara Brink was also a distinguished crystallographer and she wanted to be able to work

222
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,280
to have an appointment. At that time there was a law, in fact it may still exist that came

223
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:11,520
into being during the depression. There was an anti-nepotism law and it decreed that no members

224
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,480
of the same family, I don't remember how that was defined, should work in the same department

225
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,440
or in fact in the same institution but even further in the state system of higher education,

226
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,800
except under unusual circumstances. Well, about this time, Lisa, my wife who has also

227
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,440
signed us, we've been working together for years and we had a joint grant together and previous

228
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,520
to that, she had had appointments in the computer centers and associate professor and so on.

229
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,880
So she was a professional but then it was determined that by Bert Christensen

230
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,800
that he wasn't going to allow her to work any longer and be paid. And so I went to him and said,

231
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,960
look, we've got this grant here and then you've signed it on the bottom, the line item on the budget

232
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,360
and Lisa has to be able to work. He says, I'm not going to approve it. So we took it over to

233
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,920
a virtual room, who is Dean of Science at that time, bought it in, I showed him this and he says,

234
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,800
well, what did she tell me this sooner and I said, well, Bert Christensen, he were very close

235
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,560
friends and I thought we should be talking to the chain of command here and he says, well,

236
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:43,840
he says, here is a document that's legal. He says she's going to be able to work on this grant

237
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,800
until it expires but after that she wants to continue to be paid, she'll have to be

238
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,920
get a grant of her own. Well, all this approach, the Dave coming in one of his conditions,

239
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:03,600
as I say, was his wife be allowed to work. And unless he's heart, McPicker came around and he

240
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,720
looked at this and he says, okay, he says, it says that you cannot have members of the same family

241
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,520
working in this institution at the same time and being paid except under unusual circumstances.

242
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,480
He says, it's clear that a husband and wife scientific team is an unusual circumstance.

243
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,520
So he says, I am going to approve this. And then Dave said, yeah, but Ken Hedberg and his wife

244
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,840
are exactly the same situation and McPicker says the same room applied on him. Then McPicker said,

245
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,320
and this is very funny. You're a Dave and I are close friends and our wives are friends.

246
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,240
And McPicker says the only thing I'm going to ask is that you be responsible for this

247
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:58,800
in my wife and Ken who would be responsible for Clara. So once a term, Dave would call me in

248
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,080
his office, it says, okay, Ken, how is Clara doing? And we would have a big laugh. Well, I said,

249
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,360
fine, I said, how is Lucid doing? Fine, he says, that's it. So that's the history of

250
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:21,440
without condition. Dave accepted the job and was here sort of that capacity for some years until

251
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,280
he retired and then he and Clara had an office in chemistry. But he became ill with the kidney disease.

252
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Funny was on dialysis and died of a heart attack on time during dialysis over an Albany.

253
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,840
Clara lived for several years after that and they set up a fund.

254
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Anchored with $100,000 to begin with for the support of students in chemistry. So that's Dave's

255
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:02,240
shoemaker. Dave and I shared an office at Caltech. It's another interesting thing about him.

256
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:12,640
I have never been a smoker but he was and I told his story at meetings from people who asked

257
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,720
me about Dave, I said, well, you know, he didn't have an astray because that wouldn't have lasted

258
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:29,920
long. He had a French 75, how it's a shell casing, which is a brass thing with a rim on the bottom

259
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,040
and stood about two and a half feet high and I had a notch cut on the top and he'd stick you

260
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,960
sing a rep and that flip it in the ashes would come down. When he left, that thing was full of the

261
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:52,240
rim with ashes in my office. I threw it out of course but he gave up smoking right after that when

262
00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:01,840
he went to MIT and Clara never smoked and she had some respiratory problems as well and so on

263
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,880
in her late years so it might have been part of the cause. They have a distinguished son,

264
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:20,480
Bobby Schumacher who went off to Britain and he's in a story young and he's at one of the

265
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:31,200
southwestern British universities and he believed it or not has a position

266
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:42,320
as a professor of English history. This is an American. He's still an American citizen and he's

267
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,480
written his thesis was a penetrating book, a penetrating document was his published in book form

268
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,560
and got very, very good reviews. So I think that's an interesting sideline to the

269
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,800
Schumacher's both scientists, the son of the historian, lecturing on any English history to

270
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,720
Brits and being academically rewarded for it. We've talked a little bit about

271
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,720
your early trips to Norway and your associations with Norwegian, and I wanted you to talk a little bit

272
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,760
more about how that has been seen every time you've mentioned Norway and Norwegian. Oh well,

273
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,320
let's see, I want to make sure that I'm talking about the things you would want me to

274
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:37,600
how I went to Norway and how my relationship with Norway and Norwegians continued professionally

275
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,480
through the years, is that? We've talked about the beginning of the trip, and how about what?

276
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,560
We talked about your initial trip to Norway and we knew it, of course, and then

277
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,720
yeah. You're really associations with other bastards and then you know how it has all

278
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:00,400
yeah, as well. My professional associations with Norway

279
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,720
developed as a consequence of knowing Professor Othol, Otholose Olsen,

280
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,000
the leader became director of the University. I don't remember whether I'd mentioned that or not,

281
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,640
but I was there. I spent, oh, I've lived in Norway probably about five years or so,

282
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:31,520
I'll told mostly in one year of stints, and by the way, polling has often told when I've been there,

283
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:40,880
and we escorted him around Boston and the various places in Norway and gone to meetings and talks

284
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:52,880
that he's home and that he held. That did he write? In Lisa's family connections, still early years

285
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,920
of our marriage were pretty strong, and she liked to go back to Norway. So, on my first

286
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:10,320
about I could leave, at Oregon State, I decided I would go back to Norway, we had some big projects

287
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:21,040
going on, that we could share in Norway with Norwegian colleagues, and so I spent a year at the

288
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:28,080
University of Los Roman, again, in Sebaticol, and Lisa worked also. She came in, and we had a nice house,

289
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:38,480
a range for our study on the University. Actually, it's a given one apartment, they don't have houses there,

290
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:50,640
by and large, for younger people. During this time, I met a number of people who were essentially

291
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,040
two laboratories doing my kind of work at the University of Oslo, and the other at

292
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:11,120
University of Trondheim, which didn't have that name at the time. One of Lisa's got her training

293
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:18,720
in Boston's laboratory, and a number of other people did, also one of whom was a lady named

294
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:27,280
Modet, Thutettabad, who went to Trondheim, became professor there, and I was invited up there

295
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,600
and gave a lecture, and she introduced me to a student of hers named Koldian Hagen, and Koldian

296
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,040
and I, the question was, he was so finishing his degree, and I was working for a full-stocked

297
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,840
associate, so I said to him, I said, well, he's pretty good, and yes, he's very good. So,

298
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,280
Koldian came to the United States. That was the beginning of a professional relationship.

299
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,640
I think that probably my strongest professional relationship, apart from that, of course,

300
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,880
it's my wife and the work that she does in the laboratory of anyone, and he has spent a total of six

301
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,880
years in Colorado. I was coming at various times for years leave, some once twice, two years

302
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,840
or leave, and so on. How did he start with me, just to make sure he did?

303
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Hagen, H-H-E-M, and the first name is Koldian. Koldian is K-O-L, and B-J, umlauded, oh, R-M, that means

304
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:41,600
bear in the region. So, anyway, this relationship went on through the years, and then one time

305
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,080
I received an invitation, oh, I was at several times to serve on doctoral committees,

306
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,880
and one of them was Maddett's committee when she obtained her doctorate. That was quite early

307
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,960
in my career, and that was lots of fun, because it's all done very formally, you know, there's

308
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,200
a first opponent of second opponent, and then a third one is kind of a humorous opponent. So I was

309
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,200
the first opponent, and in these formal things, you're dressed very formally on the old days,

310
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,040
you used to wear tuxitos, the candidate would wear a salam, would wear a tuxedo. But we had a podium,

311
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,000
and the candidate was over here, bought it, and I was here, and there was an auditorium full

312
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,440
of people, and I had been given her thesis, and I would ask her questions, and she would answer,

313
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:39,280
and so on, and at the end, by the way, I was paid a substantial amount of money for this,

314
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,840
but that was a norm for the time. So we had a tremendous, the tradition is that the successful

315
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:54,160
candidate throws a party, and we had a wonderful, absolutely wonderful dinner party at her house,

316
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,800
a nutform and a association that continued until her death years later, but she's spent time

317
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:10,560
in Cornell's also. At any rate, so after my mid-career, when Collegard wrote me an informe,

318
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:20,400
that the university had elected to give me an honorary degree, so I could come up there,

319
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:34,080
and that was a tremendous fun also. There were three of us who were awarded an honorary degree,

320
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:42,400
and one of the guys was a fellow from Germany who had just won the Nobel Prize, so I felt myself

321
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,240
and distinguished company, and there was a big party, I still think of that great fondness.

322
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,920
And then, I think sometime before this, I was elected to membership in the Norwegian Academy of Sciences,

323
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,920
and a bit later, on another occasion, and a few years later, these are the American equivalents,

324
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,480
and the actual Norwegian name is, well, I don't have to describe it, but anyway, let's say,

325
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:26,000
one of them is the Norwegian calendar part of the National Academy of Sciences here,

326
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,440
and the other one is the Norwegian calendar part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,

327
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,000
and I've been asked, I've been awarded a membership in each one of these.

328
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,600
So all of this is a consequence of this long stretch of professional affiliation I've had with people in Norway.

329
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,120
I think the laboratory that does my kind of work in Oslo has now extinct,

330
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,120
and the one in the Trondheim is also, and everybody who has involved in my day just as I am, is retired.

331
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,760
And so the university efforts have gone off in different directions, but everyone that

332
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:16,240
belonged to this laboratory almost every single person at Oslo, I think borrowing one, has been

333
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:24,560
sometime in my laboratory, and almost everyone in Trondheim has also spent time in my laboratory.

334
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:36,160
So there's that number, so maybe 10 or 15 people altogether spent as long as two years

335
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:44,560
in my laboratory. I have a book in my office, in which I formed the early habit of taking a

336
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,120
pulmonary picture and pasting the book and asking them to sign their name to it, and all of these

337
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:59,040
people are there, and on one occasion when I was going to go to Norway, I was asked if I would

338
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,640
give a talk in Trondheim, and I said yes, and I got to thinking about this, so I called you in

339
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,960
hog and by this time I became a professor in Trondheim, so I pitched out all the pictures that I had

340
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,400
and arranged them in sequence from the time he first came, the time he last came, and they were about

341
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:24,480
heat of them, and I had a series of slides made of it, and I came to talk, I said, I want to

342
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,200
show you the history of one of our good friends, and so I put these up there, and to the

343
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,400
immense hilarity of the audience, because they'd never seen hog and as a young man, they'd always

344
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,520
seen it, and I could show his development with dates underneath. Well that made quite a hit on that

345
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:52,640
talk, he's never let me forget about that, even. So it's been a great boon and fun for me,

346
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,360
so I have also formed a professional attachment in friends with people at the University of Trondheim,

347
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,880
which is an annoying Norway, and at the University of Oregon, in the West Coast.

348
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,840
Well it's been a very fine thing for me.

349
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:25,920
I hear a list of names of people from the OSU permission department over the years, and when

350
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:34,720
they would be sharing your recollections, you have about something called John Fulton. John Fulton is the only

351
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:43,200
one that I never met in person. When I came to Oregon State in 1939, Gilbert was chair,

352
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,120
and I don't know how long he had been chairman at that point, but he certainly was still chairman

353
00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:05,760
in 1956, when I returned. I think he actually retired from the German ship in 57. I wanted to

354
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:14,000
spend the last 30 years of his life as doing teaching and research again. That's when Christmas

355
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,560
looks excited in. So every, I don't know whether you've seen all the pictures and chemistry

356
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:34,800
had you. If you're going on the main hall, Gilbert Hall, on the end, nearest here at the library,

357
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,360
and walked down on the left-hand side high-op is a chronological arrangement of all professors

358
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:54,320
that have been present at this and that department and retired. John Fulton is the first one in the

359
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:04,560
list. Every single person I have known have a succeeding 20 or 30 up to 1 down the whole. Of course,

360
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:12,080
the last I've been retired long enough, so I'm quite a long way from the end now, but everybody

361
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,040
on, or to the president, I've known them all, except for them. That's what kind of we got that.

362
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:27,120
How about the fence board, Gilbert? Sorry, the fence board, Gilbert. You'll feel them again. Oh, yes, yeah.

363
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:37,600
He didn't have an active role in the chemistry department. He was Dean of the College of Science

364
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:45,040
and during the war for a short time, he was acting president of the university. I don't remember

365
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:58,640
this correctly, but he was a very, very dark man and a wonderful personality. I didn't know him well.

366
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,440
I met him on a number of occasions and he was still alive when I returned to the university,

367
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,080
but he suffered from, I don't remember whether it was Parkinson's or all. I think it was also

368
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:21,840
him, as he said, he finally succumbed to it, but he was just a wonderful guy. His family has set up

369
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:36,080
a research award in his name called the Guilfall on a prize. That's given every year to a faculty member.

370
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:48,240
Earl Gilbert. Earl Gilbert. The hall was not named Gilbert Hall until after he died,

371
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,000
because there was at that time a rule against naming buildings after living people.

372
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:04,320
Gilbert was a big guy. He walked with a kind of a shuffle. He was a physical chemist.

373
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:17,360
He had two sons, Henry and Alan, and Henry was a classmate of mine as an undergraduate.

374
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:26,480
In the war broke out, he was involved in warwork, or over in Albany. I don't know that it was

375
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,120
a Bureau of Minds and whether he was working with blockchain or whatever in the warwork.

376
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:47,440
But he died of a malignancy. People think it was related to ingestion and inhalation of

377
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:55,600
beraleum, which was extremely toxic. His son Alan Gilbert, I mean his brother, Alan Gilbert,

378
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:06,320
Earl Gilbert's son was a surgeon at the Coralis clinic many years. He retired as I understand it,

379
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:13,120
because he developed severe arthritis in his hands. He was a very nice guy.

380
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,120
Well, Gilbert, I had only one course from him when I was an undergraduate. The department's

381
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:27,520
chairman actually taught them, and he taught physical chemistry.

382
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:42,800
I recall one kind of plombient experience with Earl Gilbert when I was an undergraduate.

383
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,440
There was a chemistry on our society called Phyllandup Solom.

384
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,040
And I was elective membership in this, and Henry Gilbert, who was a chemistry major, was not.

385
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:15,040
Henry Gilbert was a, I want to say, a very pounce-boken outgoing guy. He was not elected

386
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:22,640
to, when you're elected to membership, a voter's taken. And if there is any, I don't recall

387
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,280
what the circumstances of the election, what the rules are or were at that time.

388
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,000
But he was not elected. And Earl Gilbert, his father, was very upset at this.

389
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:48,000
And he called me into his office and he says, I cannot ask you who he is in a very different way.

390
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,680
Let me know. I was very disappointed that Henry had not been elected. At that time, the chemistry,

391
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:06,640
the Phyllandup Solom had members comprising majors in chemistry and chemical engineering's large way.

392
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,360
And he says, I can't ask you, of course, about the vote, but he said, can you tell me this?

393
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:22,800
I suspect, was it mostly the engineers that were involved in this negative vote.

394
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,960
And I hesitated a long time when I said, well, you know, I felt like I had to answer it.

395
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,680
And I said, yes, it was. He just shrugged his shoulders. I know he deployed it.

396
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:45,440
There was a strong Greek community on the campus at the time that I was here.

397
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,800
There was a kind of a social division between the independence and the Greeks.

398
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:02,800
And that division seemed to extend into honor societies as well.

399
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:10,800
People were voted for membership. And you know, in retrospect, it's utterly ridiculous to think

400
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:19,920
that somebody who is academically well qualified would be not voted into an organization for personality reasons.

401
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,520
I like Henry Gilbert. We got along just fine. And he didn't have the shy, respectful attitude

402
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,600
that maybe these people expected he should have. But that was very upsetting to Earl Gilbert.

403
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:43,680
Another thing about the Gilbert, once a year, they invited the chemistry department to dinner at their house

404
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,160
with their faculty, with their spouses. And there was always a very nice dinner.

405
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,120
Now, the Gilbert's were Titovers. No alcohol was served.

406
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,360
Tomatoes were served instead. And that was all, oh, well, I'm good.

407
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:12,240
No, everybody understood this. Then the Gilbert's on off, I think it may have been one summer.

408
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:22,960
They took a trip to France. And they came back. And when I was slave all, a good friend of mine

409
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,520
was hosting a dinner party. And he asked the Lisa Nye where asked, we're invited as where the Gilbert's

410
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:37,360
and some other people in physical chemistry. And it was a very nice dinner. And when it'll ask me

411
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:49,040
ahead of time, he says, do you think I should offer people a cherry or a drink or wine with dinner?

412
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:55,360
And I said, well, it's your party. Why not? And the Gilbert's as I say, I just come back in this trip in France.

413
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,840
So, Wendel and Duke, of course, asked everybody what to read the forer and Earl Gilbert said,

414
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:13,200
well, I'll have a class of tomato juice. And his wife said, I think I'd like some cherry.

415
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:24,000
So, Gilbert wins. And she had a glass of cherry on the conversation with me. She said,

416
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,920
my that was nice. Sherry, I like that very much. And Gilbert modeled, and I like my tomato juice too.

417
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,160
I understood that I don't worry where I got this information, but I understood that,

418
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,640
as they traveled through France, they did drink wine because that's about the only thing that

419
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:55,680
you would be served at a meal. And maybe that's, oh, Mrs. Gilbert, just from a moment I can't remember

420
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:04,640
her name, but it'll come to me. They were nice people, I like them.

421
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Will they express my analysis and will Wendel say well?

422
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:23,760
Oh, Wendel was a remarkable person. I held him in the highest regard, not when I first came, but later on.

423
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:34,800
He, um, um, when I first came, did I mention that there was, uh, I mentioned the Christmas

424
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,760
and became chairman after Gilbert, but that was not when I had a hitch in the proceedings.

425
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,640
Have I ever mentioned that? Well, for some gone forsaken reason, it was determined that the department

426
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,880
should, uh, not only elect, which was a reasonable enough, that should vote for who they would

427
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,680
propose a department chairman. Of course, that was non-binding because the dean is the one who makes a decision.

428
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:07,280
But one other thing for some reason, there's nobody seems to remember this, but me, I'll have to

429
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:15,760
dig out my records. The department decided it was going to have a constitution democracy with going to

430
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:21,680
rule. Now, if you think about that, how ridiculous can you imagine? You can't run a department

431
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,240
has a democracy with a legislature that determines things. You're going to have a department chairman.

432
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:36,560
The next things happen. The others at May, slave all ran for, uh, he came around and I was new

433
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:44,320
with this time, longer Tom Parsons. And, uh, I knew that he was a candidate. He came around

434
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:53,520
and, uh, in a very subtle way, was discussing this. And, uh, Christmasen was the era parent.

435
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,160
As I explained, uh, burnt shell on was a dean and they were good friends and everybody expected

436
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:07,600
that Christmasen, as they, as they, as the oldest and most experienced and long-served,

437
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:13,120
longest serving department member, would become chairman. He was a good scientist. He did

438
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,880
hard work and he's one of the few people who were regularly publishing at Oregon State at that time.

439
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,960
Well, slave all was running. Also, and, uh, there was determined that, uh, the person

440
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:36,400
who won the elections, name would go forward. Now, I don't remember whether

441
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,440
slave all won this election. I don't know how many votes were cast. Maybe 20, 12, 12, or 30,

442
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:53,760
won the election by one vote. And, hall hell broke loose. You know, uh, Christmasen was terribly

443
00:59:53,840 --> 01:00:08,480
upset. And so, and, uh, as slave all told me later, he was invited, uh, over to, uh, a dean's office.

444
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:15,200
I don't know whether it was shell on and there's someone else. And sat down and talked to an

445
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:23,440
friendly matter, by this official, who pointed out that he was a young man, and that, uh, the

446
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:33,440
department would undoubtedly, uh, run better if somebody was long experienced whose chairman.

447
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,360
And as a young man, he would have plenty of chances to rise through the, uh, hierarchy into a

448
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,720
administrative position. And slave while reading the handwriting on the wall, just, uh,

449
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,520
then a now-city was withdrawing his name from consideration. That was his public statement,

450
01:00:53,520 --> 01:01:03,120
but his private feelings I, uh, have relayed to you. So, Christmasen became chairman. And I think he always

451
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:14,080
said that, uh, well, I want to call it feeling of having been rejected, hanging over him for a

452
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:20,800
long time. So, he stole very hard to be what he thought would be a good chairman. And I could

453
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:28,720
tell you about that also, but slave on was a distinguished teacher. His lectures were very popular.

454
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:39,600
And he had a most original mind. Uh, he, uh, he did unusual things. He built himself, uh,

455
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:49,920
was rare at that time, a three-wheeled bicycle with, uh, enclosed in, uh, uh, uh, a canopy over the top,

456
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:55,760
which had, uh, plastic windows in front, so he was shielded from the wind. And he would pedal this

457
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,440
thing to work. Now, a little flag up the back. This is it. You see some of the handicapped people using these

458
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,600
today. Not him. He had this. Later on, he built something similar. And he put a motor on it.

459
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:17,280
It was electric motor and operated by a battery. He built it all himself. He lived on, uh, on Grant Street,

460
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:32,880
uh, up about, uh, 30 fourth street on the right-hand side. And he had hedges there. And he trimmed these hedges.

461
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:41,440
So, what is the art form known when you cut these in the form of shapes and animals? He meticulously

462
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:48,560
groomed these plants. And he had one sitting there that had wheels on it. And a canopy and a steering wheel.

463
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,880
Just one bush that had been sculpted into that shape. Others, he sculpted into animal shapes.

464
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:02,960
And then in his driveway, which sloped down to the street, he painted one of the very famous, uh,

465
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:17,040
oh, what's the guy's name who does these peculiar drawings? Their famous, now he's the famous artist,

466
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:26,000
the water that runs uphill without sending to do this. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He painted the black and white

467
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,680
dogs that, you know, mesh together and are going down to the sidewalk. He built outside, uh,

468
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,920
a bench into the wall. His yard sloped down to a concrete area there. And he built a bench in there,

469
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:47,680
a wood. And it says, uh, I don't remember the Italian words exactly, or the pronunciation, but

470
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:55,680
he said, and since it's something, come although they're public or for the convenience of

471
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:06,160
the public, he said. We got to know him and his wife very well, uh, later on, we saw them socially

472
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:17,760
a good deal. And, uh, Laws' wife was a very nice lady. Uh, Wendell, uh, he had this nice house.

473
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:25,440
He had an idea. He went down to the GT one time and he bought or brought, I think he was

474
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:32,320
they were given to him a number of, uh, plates, which were used in printing, which were all black

475
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,960
on the top. They were, uh, perhaps, uh, glass or something. I don't know. But he bought a whole bunch of

476
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,560
these and he built himself a box on his roof and he mounted these things to the sunwood hit it

477
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,840
and he slowly circulated air through this, which he then arranged to be pumped down into his house.

478
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:57,840
And, uh, you still have to have a furnace, of course. But he said this, uh, noticeably

479
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,920
reduces heating costs. Then in later years, he would quit early and he says, I need some

480
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,120
exercising, we'd go home and I discovered he was digging a huge sister in his yard.

481
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,720
And, uh, I saw this thing being constructed and he had great lines in back too. Wasn't a big yard,

482
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,160
but he had great lines as well. And, when this was completed, you know, we were up there a

483
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,520
dinner one time, since come and see my sister and it was just completed. And I looked down in this

484
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,040
down thing. It was about eight feet across and it was at least eight feet tall. It was a huge

485
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:39,040
thing and he dug it all by hand, made the lining and everything and it's concreteed at all up

486
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:46,240
and so on. And, he said, uh, there it is. He says, I'm going to start filling it and he says,

487
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,800
let's go down and he had a ladder built on the side. So we went down, we sat down on a

488
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:57,600
couple chairs in the bottom. We'll even describe this sister into me. So then we went upstairs

489
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,760
and he covered it and he typed all the water that fell on his roof, all of that went into the

490
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:10,880
sister, which he then pumped out to water, he's garden. The front lawn and the vines and back,

491
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:22,240
everything. And then the city then had an assessment for storm for drainage. So we went down to

492
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,200
the city and said he wanted to have his drainage reduced because the property was not as big as

493
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,400
they said it was and he gave him an estimate of a score footage of the roof on his house and he

494
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:39,760
wanted to proportional reduction in his drainage sheet. The city would have nothing to do with this.

495
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:47,680
At which point he realized that this drainage was really a tax on the amount of land that you had,

496
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:54,880
not really on, it's disguised the way he put it to me. So that was window.

497
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:07,040
He died of a heart attack and he's asleep and there's tragic thing, the lowest was very upset

498
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:15,440
and she continued to live in the house for quite a while and she would come to our house regularly

499
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:23,360
and we would go up there to dinner and she came to us for dinner and I did some work,

500
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:29,680
a little work in our house for. I repaired the toilet that was leaking around the seam at the

501
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:36,000
bottom, put a new boat, boot in it and I drilled a hole in a door and put one of these view ports in it

502
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:44,880
for a few things like that and she developed an infection that when a time it was diagnosed her

503
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:53,680
condition was so poor that she even after treatment, she couldn't recover and she eventually died

504
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:03,840
from it, not the infection but the fact that she had no reserves left. So that's the story of

505
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:14,080
the slaves, as I know, they had one son who isn't California still, he has no children and he is an

506
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:23,760
orthopedic surgeon. He had a daughter named Jane, who babysat our kids when they were small and

507
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:32,000
she became for a reason, so it was never entirely clear to me a strange from her mother and she lives

508
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,840
in Seattle. She was married and then divorced and I think I've seen her once up there but I don't

509
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:43,360
know what's become of her since then. That's about what I know of the slave laws.

510
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,760
You've made some great business in there, did you find Jane?

511
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:56,480
Oh, yes. Well, Burton very much wanted people to realize that convince people he was a very good

512
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,600
department chairman and we have an chemistry department at that time. We have a source of

513
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,960
chemicals. Let's call it a store room. There are a lot of chemicals used at that time in organic

514
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:16,080
chemistry and so on. There's a big supply in there and he would buy these in bulk and they would be

515
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:24,400
repackaged in jars and labeled with a number and so on on them and other departments, you know,

516
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:32,000
it couldn't afford a store room like this. This would be sold to them at the price that was

517
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:40,800
less or maybe just a trifle less of a price listed for the same size container of the same material

518
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:48,160
in the drug and chemical scallot. And by buying it both, when we're packaging it, we save money,

519
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:57,360
you made money and that money was used to support various things. After realized on those days,

520
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,440
there was almost no money for anything. You wanted to replace the equipment, you know,

521
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:10,880
there's like pulling teeth to get any money from the university for that. And this enabled things

522
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:22,160
to proceed in the department and to keep us at least hanging on. The trouble with this was

523
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:32,960
that this money, which went into a call, had to be spent by the 30th of June. And sometimes

524
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:40,560
persons were very frugal. He would get all this stuff piled up there and then he didn't have

525
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,320
a way of spending it before the end. So all sorts of peculiar things happened. He came down to me

526
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,040
one time and says, can, how do you like to have your office painted? I said, my office painted,

527
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,600
I don't need my office painted, and he says, well, you know, it's a little dingy in here.

528
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:02,240
We should paint through these offices and I just shrugged in. So my office was painted and that

529
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:08,640
used up some of the money. On another occasion, he was walking down the hall and the basement.

530
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,800
He says, you know, I don't like the look of all these pipes over ahead. This, in the basement,

531
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:19,280
everything was open all sorts of vents and pipes that look terrible. He says, I think, how would you

532
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:27,520
react to the idea that we put a false ceiling in a mask-built list of? I said, well,

533
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,520
can do it if you want. I don't see the need for it. In fact, it improves the appearance of things

534
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:40,800
for it also makes it substantially more difficult to locate the source of problems. So in

535
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,960
due course we have that false ceiling, which if you're going to the basement of Gilbert, you can see

536
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,160
it's still there. It's got holes punched in it. It's white panels suspended from the ceiling.

537
01:11:52,160 --> 01:12:05,840
So Burke was very, very conscious of how I want to say. He seemed to be covering his tracks

538
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:12,720
all the time. And one of the reasons that he refused to renew my wife's appointment had nothing at

539
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:22,080
all to do with science. Anything like that, she was paid very modestly on any of that. But for the

540
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:30,240
first time in history, just before he took this action, the city of Coralis defeated upon

541
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:39,680
measure designed as support schools. And he thought, boy, people are looking at what the education

542
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:44,880
system is doing and here they're going to see that there's a faculty member of why it was being

543
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,040
paid on a faculty member being paid through the system. Of course, my grants were to the

544
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:58,640
university and they were paid. And he decided he couldn't tolerate a possibility of somebody objecting

545
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:09,120
to this. And that was the reason that he advanced to me. He says, we have to be very careful of our

546
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:14,960
image. He advanced to Lisa. I didn't have any new in it. She wrote him a letter, went to see him,

547
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,200
wrote him another letter, and nothing. Finally, he refused to answer her letters, and that's when

548
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:29,840
we went over to the dean. But I remember a remarkable Gilbert said, one time, he was a gruffle

549
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:36,400
guy and he spoke down like he says, he says, he says, he says, bird is sort of like a country horse.

550
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:52,400
He shies it a paper in the road. So that's Mark. He contributed after he retired, you know,

551
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:59,840
he sent up a fund designed to help graduate students attend meetings when they were working

552
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,680
in research with research groups for which there was no money. And that was used to a quite

553
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:12,800
lot. And I thank him a couple of times when I saw him on the streets. And he says, oh well,

554
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,320
I'm pleased. He says, if you need more money, let me know. And I don't know whether he put more money

555
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,800
up or not. I was not going to be fine with gentlemen. So yeah, he's good sides.

556
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:40,960
So that's an instrument, gentlemen. I don't remember much about burn on the same personal

557
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:46,400
element basis that mentioned these other people because he was sitting in the dean's office

558
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:52,160
at the time. Well, when I first came here, he was sort of something who was ahead of something

559
01:14:52,160 --> 01:15:00,320
called the Research Institute. And it turned out, in the early days, there was the group of

560
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:11,360
biochemists associated with chemistry. Among who was Schell alumnum. And he decided that he would

561
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:19,920
like to set up this independent entity. There were lots of reasons for it because overhead

562
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:27,760
that was returned to these agencies. At that time, the university returned part of the overhead

563
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,800
to the departments. And the departments then to determine how they were going to use this returned

564
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:41,760
overhead. Well, I think burn had some ambitions. But clearly he did. He was a nice guy,

565
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:51,840
by the way. He arranged, I'm sure, with the support of Chris and Santa, take these biochemists

566
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:58,160
to set up what they call the science research institute, which is largely biochemistry.

567
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:11,840
And then later on, that became, I think, kind of morphed into a longer perhaps,

568
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,000
other departments, I'm not quite sure, and the department about chemistry and biofysics.

569
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:27,760
And then, uh, burn became the department, the department. He suffered from health problems,

570
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,880
serious ones. He had, uh, very high blood pressure at one stage, and he died really rather young.

571
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:45,520
His life was, uh, very well known, also, um, was that I read the name on the range of women.

572
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,840
But I think she served, uh, she was certainly involved in local politics.

573
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:03,600
And I don't know whether, uh, she'll have a middle school as, uh, they were philanthropic also.

574
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:10,960
Whether that followed mostly from her work or from them jointly as the couple, but at any rate.

575
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,600
So, uh, that's about as much as I know, burn.

576
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,400
First, I see one of the street with shake hands and shout a bit, and then I had this,

577
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,880
at least, and I had this contact with him in the occasion of her appointment. That's about all we had to do with him.

578
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,400
Yeah, that's what my list is, Kelvin.

579
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,800
Oh, Carol, the cock? Yeah. Oh, Carol is a wonderful guy.

580
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:45,760
I, I regard him as one of the, certainly one of the better Germans that I have, uh, experienced here.

581
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,600
Carol had a research program in, uh, in organic chemistry when I first came.

582
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,800
And, uh, he decided he would, uh,

583
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:03,760
whatever reason. I think his research was slowing down that he would, uh, run for department,

584
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:14,800
German German, and, uh, uh, I think that there were two choices. One of them was, uh,

585
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:22,320
Gerrit Thomas, and the other was Carol, and I think the ultimate decision was made by the dean,

586
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:30,000
that it would be Gerrit Thomas, and after he served for a term, Carol became department, German.

587
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:42,000
Now, Carol, he really ran the department the way that a lot of us would like to see it done.

588
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,480
He once professed him, he says, look, he says, my research days have over, I view my role in this department,

589
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:59,120
as to expedite the research and teaching potential of the department to the maximum, uh, possible.

590
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:08,880
And so he was no, uh, the difference between him and the Christmas and say to choose an example.

591
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:16,080
Christmas, and you couldn't probably a dime out of him, uh, until then, when you saw this

592
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,840
flamboyant expenditures being made, I'd go to Carol and I'd say, look, I need some money from my

593
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:28,240
return overhead, by the way. In those days, the department received returned overhead from the

594
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,320
university, maybe they still do, I don't know, but the department to determine how well they

595
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:40,560
did with the overhead and our department of the practice of returning about 80% of the overhead

596
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:47,760
that was derived from the research grant of an individual to that individual.

597
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:55,680
So if you had a big research grant, I'll put you a lot of overhead was extracted,

598
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:00,800
returned to the department, then you would have a chunk of money to deal with, because I think they

599
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:09,760
returned 80% or so, and you could use that anyway you want. Now, what happened was that an order

600
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,360
should be said about that returned overhead was now available and you should write down what your

601
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:25,040
needs are. Now, wasn't that the overhead was directed specifically to the individual who had

602
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:31,120
earned it, but that would receive some priority, but a lot of us didn't need all of them overhead,

603
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:39,120
and so we build up formally speaking and account. Other people who needed equipment that exceeded

604
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:45,120
the return overhead could use the return overhead, and then you would have a credit so to speak.

605
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:54,400
Well, of course, it's not a business, and looking back at perspectives and the visual

606
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,120
would have seen that this can't persist, and the guys who have the credits are probably

607
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:05,280
never going to realize their money back again, whereas those guys who are in debt, you know,

608
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,120
the department's going to decide they're not going to distribute overhead anymore, and so they

609
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:16,480
come out swimming like a rose. Well, I didn't need all of my money, because I was saying,

610
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:22,480
I had equipment budgets, and I could buy any equipment and apparatus that I needed. But Carol,

611
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,840
when I went to him on a couple of occasions saying, I need this, or I need that,

612
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:34,000
Carol, and I don't have the money in my budget for it. He says, how much is it? I'd tell him.

613
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:45,120
He'd look at this and say, okay, go ahead, buy it. And he was very effective in this way,

614
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:51,120
and I think people respected him for that, because people didn't go to him to try to buy things

615
01:21:51,120 --> 01:22:00,240
that really didn't need. And this was in keeping with his professed remark to me, his remark to me,

616
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:06,800
that he was going to do what he could to expedite the teaching and research activities of the

617
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,520
department. If you needed money for your research, and you didn't have it, he tried to get it for you.

618
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:21,600
He was very good. He's still around. We have an old man's lunch once a month. Did you know that?

619
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:36,320
The old man's lunch started way, way back in 1986, and it started with a bus marvel,

620
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:47,040
Elliott Marvel, a professor of organic chemistry, who retired and jacked issues, and it may have been

621
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:55,520
Harry front also there, decided they would meet for lunch. And then there were probably four of them all told,

622
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:03,760
and then when I retired, they decided that I would be invited to this, and then it became a kind

623
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:13,680
of a monthly affair. And as people have retired, that has kept going. So every retiree in chemistry,

624
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:21,760
and two or three in Bach, chemistry involved as the Chris Matthews comes, can then hold as a part of it.

625
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:31,520
Bob Becker comes, and several chemists come. Several chemists who could come don't because

626
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,920
their active tennis players still, and they had matches Wednesday at noon when we have our meetings

627
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:51,360
once a month. But I go regularly. And so Carol, the co-comps. And he's a very lively guy.

628
01:23:51,360 --> 01:24:00,800
It's also fun to see him. He's been very active. He bought a house on a teoria road. He's been an active

629
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:09,120
co-actor for years. And finally, he decided that the commute for him and his wife was just too

630
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:14,960
much, so they sold out property, at least in the process of selling it, and bought some last year

631
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:21,520
here in town, where he's now living. But he still co-acts. In fact, they went down the road recently,

632
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:28,960
and he's been down the Grand Canyon more than once than his own co-act. So he's very active physically.

633
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
Wonderful guy.

634
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:40,880
What are some of the more crippled, crippled, remember, all the things you said about things here,

635
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,000
what the strategy is to use?

636
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:55,760
A memorable experience is working with graduate students. Well, I'm thinking here as I'm sitting.

637
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:06,960
I've had some very good graduate students, and some that were not so good.

638
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,280
Almost all of whom have finished and gotten a degree.

639
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,160
Let me name one who came along fairly late. His name was Chen Fan Huang.

640
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:30,960
And he was a Chinese national, and he came here when all I'd have to look to see, but it's been

641
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:39,120
almost 20 years now. Perhaps even more than that. From China,

642
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:46,640
when it was still a highly restricted place, and he grew up in time of the cultural revolution

643
01:25:46,720 --> 01:26:01,360
by his own bootstrapped, lifted himself up. And he became aware of a position I had,

644
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:09,840
and I don't remember the details, but I decided he would be a good addition.

645
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,200
And I think he was coming at the beginning with his own money.

646
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:23,520
So he arrived. I had several students working with me at that time.

647
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:37,200
And one of these was a young woman that was working away when he showed up, and I happened to be

648
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:45,840
away that day he arrived. He came into the laboratory. This young woman was trying to do some work

649
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:57,200
on her computer, and he spoke a rather poor English at this time, but he was as

650
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:06,880
young whole as they could come. And after a while, I think a day or two later, this girl came

651
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,000
to me. And so I can't stand this guy. She says, over my shoulder, all the time, ask me also. It's

652
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:22,160
a question. He was so eager. Well, by this time I was taking him in hand myself, and he was

653
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:31,040
beginning to enroll in courses. And he was very anxious to start research. And he was dynamic.

654
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:44,320
He was a tremendous researcher. And he was an older man. And he had had a lot of work in chemistry,

655
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,120
even at the theoretical, that was very knowledgeable. But he was required to fulfill

656
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:56,960
our department requirements, of course, for course, work. And he enrolled in theoretical chemistry.

657
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:06,560
And he got straight A's, no question about it. At the end of his first year, he is

658
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:12,560
old at the outstanding incoming graduate student. And then a year later he was old at the

659
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:18,400
outstanding graduate student. And each of these carried financial stipends, not a great deal,

660
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:27,040
but some. And one day he came to me and said, you know, the Chinese are very cognizant of

661
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:38,320
let's say of a social hierarchy on the reference, which should be paid to people who occupy a

662
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:44,880
state as a little more elevated than yours. And so he came to me having just attended

663
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:51,440
lecture in quantum mechanics by one of our faculty members. And he said to me,

664
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:57,520
quote, he said, is it all right to correct a professor when he's wrong?

665
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:10,720
And I said, yes it is. You should tell him or raise the issue and tell him about it and say

666
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:19,600
that you think this is the right answer. But I'm not quite sure that he ever followed through on that.

667
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,720
Well, he did a lot of work. And then at the end of his graduation, he got his degree.

668
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:36,160
He worked for a while with Doug Kessler in chemistry. And then a colleague of mine at Michigan named

669
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:43,040
Larry Bartel was looking for somebody and I recommended Jim Wong to him. And of course, he shows up

670
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:49,120
and Larry isn't doing quite the same kind of work that I am. And Larry has a very abrasive

671
01:29:51,360 --> 01:30:00,000
no nonsense personality. But I think he met his match in Genre and Huang, because he would tell

672
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,640
Huang to do something and Huang would do it, but then he would point out he could do it better this

673
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:13,760
way and he would do it that way. So it turns out that Huang was married and he could hardly wait

674
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:20,320
to get his wife to come to this country. And finally, he arranged so that she could come.

675
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:29,440
And they had two children, two boys, which is, of course, out of the line there.

676
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:36,080
At any rate, the first thing that did, the woman came, he wanted her here so she could cook and he

677
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:42,080
could spend more time doing research. And he enrolled his son in the high school as elder son.

678
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:50,160
I guess both kids, but I don't remember so much about the younger. Anyway, he was very distressed

679
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:56,000
because after a while, the younger son was not rushing home after school and spending the rest of the

680
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:02,080
afternoon studying. The son became quite used to American manners and he liked the social life

681
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,320
and so on and just distressed his father immensely, expected him to behave like a Chinese.

682
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,560
So he came to me with his problem and I said, Genre, and I said, how's your son doing? Well,

683
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,080
he could do better. He could come home and he could be studying advanced things and I said,

684
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:24,640
well, how are his grades? He said, what grades? I said, well, what are the marks he gets?

685
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:31,680
The course of the thesis, when they get so old age. So it wasn't an upper-gen fund that his kid was

686
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:39,680
excelling by Americans standards. He had to study all of his spare time and see. Well, the things went on,

687
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:48,400
his wife had to go home or he's expired and then he learned after she'd been home a long time

688
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:57,840
that she was pregnant. At which time he immediately divorced her? That's unknowable there,

689
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:06,160
you see. And I think I don't know whether his sons had gone back or whether they stayed with him

690
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:15,680
here or not. I just don't remember that. But then he began to look for a new wife.

691
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:24,480
And this is kind of a mail order proposition. And so I don't know how the Chinese do it traditionally,

692
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:31,680
but there's any rate he found some woman in Shanghai. He went to visit her and I think they

693
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:38,640
eventually married. And she's a little more modern type than he was. And she joined even

694
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:44,880
Minnesota and I think they're still there. I don't know whether they have any children together or

695
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:53,440
enough. But he found a job in an industry and an arbor, but he still works weekends in Larry

696
01:32:53,440 --> 01:33:02,880
Bartell's laboratory. So he's the most notable graduate student from several points of view that I've

697
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:12,080
had. I've had postdocs that are even just as remarkable one from Japan in particular. We're

698
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:26,240
getting on here. How long do you want to go? I can go a while longer. Let me talk about one of my postdocs.

699
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:32,480
I mean, I have a host of graduate students and each one of those has got his own personalities

700
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:40,560
and some have been very productive, some less productive. But I want to mention something

701
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:52,080
that I think is remarkable life or a pair of lives. There was a distinguished professor named

702
01:33:52,080 --> 01:34:03,760
Yonaiso Morino, Morino in Japan, at the University of Tokyo. And in 1960, I think it was

703
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:12,960
60 at land in 62. But at any rate, I had a letter or a roll letter. I was looking for a postdoctoral

704
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:22,240
pointer, pointy. And Yonaiso was called Morino. We became friends and I've seen him all over the

705
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:33,040
world of meetings in Norway and other places. He wrote to me about his student named Machio

706
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:42,160
He was hockey. Who would like to study and he could recommend him. Now, Machio came to the United

707
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:54,480
States, having gotten his doctorate in Japan and he was phenomenal. He was a superb mathematician

708
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:06,000
and an excellent experimentalist. He had only rudimentary English, but I spoke slowly and he

709
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,440
could understand me and I could understand him. Well, it turned out that when you knew he would

710
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:19,280
come here the United States in three months, he'd had no English experience at all. He, and of course,

711
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:25,520
he had essentially no money. They don't have money at his graduate students in Japan at that time.

712
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:36,560
And so he went in hawk and enrolled in a course in Crash Course in English language.

713
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,640
And he managed to get enough English so that he could speak to me in English in three months

714
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:52,240
time. Now, that's very, it's not so hard for Western speaking person to do that, but Japanese

715
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:58,640
is so different that it's a tour of course. He became much better as time went along.

716
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,680
So he asked me to find a helping find a place to live, which I did and it was very

717
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:10,560
satisfactory. It was very low level, but after all, he was here to do research. He had his wife

718
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:21,840
with him, had no children. And a few weeks later, he came to me, he said, did I know a doctor?

719
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,840
He said, well, what's the problem? He says, my wife is terrible pains in her legs and so on.

720
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:36,880
And we better see a doctor. And so I gave him the name of a doctor that we had used for kids.

721
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:44,480
And it came to me the next day and he said, oh, I didn't need the doctor. He solved the problem.

722
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:51,680
The problem was that never in Japan had this woman been sitting in chairs.

723
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:58,720
She had always been in the Japanese traditional position on her knees and legs with her feet

724
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,640
back like this. The minute she started to do that, all her pains disappeared.

725
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:08,960
So she could sit on the chairs intermittently and sooner or later, the problem vanished.

726
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:16,000
Another time it came to me and says, I need to have vitamins. You know where I can get vitamins.

727
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,360
I says, oh, yeah, you can find them in any store. And he then told me, well, he didn't mean that.

728
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,160
And I said, well, what kind of vitamins do you mean? He says, I want that. He says, I take vitamins,

729
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:31,840
but I inject them. And I say, well, people don't inject vitamins here. You can take them all away.

730
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:41,200
And then another time he came to me and said that, well, you spent a year.

731
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,680
Then he asked me if he could continue another year. And I said, yes, of course you can't.

732
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:51,920
So he worked very hard. And then he came to me at that year and he said, I've been thinking about another apartment.

733
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,800
I said, and he said, I would like to have you join me and look at it.

734
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:07,840
So it was over on Western Avenue, or he had been living on 11th Street in an old brick building,

735
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:15,040
there with the apartment building. And so this place was lighter and more airy and it seemed to me

736
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:23,200
I'm like a nice place and it was cheaper. And he seemed very hesitant about it and he kept looking at me.

737
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:31,920
And then sometime later he said, you wouldn't lose face if I'm on terror.

738
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:42,400
Apparently on his mind because it was cheaper, it was a downgrade and quality when

739
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:49,120
matter of fact it was an upgrade and quality. But what is remarkable about this is his having been

740
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:53,840
raised in the time, maybe it's still of where face is everything.

741
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:03,040
Well, the story is incomplete without my telling you a little bit about his wife who is even more

742
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,640
remarkable. She couldn't take English, she knew no English, and she came here.

743
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:17,120
She came from a fairly well-off Japanese family, very Western, who are as much as family

744
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:24,080
was very traditional. His father was an old sea captain. And the daughter-in-law was expected to

745
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:38,560
do everything in the house, they lived. Anyway, she did housework for no pay with the stipulation

746
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:45,200
that the person for whom she worked would speak only English to her and try to help her

747
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:53,520
understand the English language. And that went on for months, and she became conversational

748
01:39:53,520 --> 01:40:00,480
in English in a whole thing way. Then, Monsho said after his first hearing says,

749
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:08,000
now I want to buy a car, I want a car. So he passed the driver's license,

750
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:14,560
I think he failed at once, then passed it, both the written and so on. Many's wife said she

751
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:22,240
wanted one, but she couldn't read English. She could only speak it. And of course, I give you

752
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,800
this manual with all the written instructions, what the signs mean, everything. She looked at

753
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:34,000
the manual and this is how she memorized everything in the manual. She went and took the written

754
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:42,800
exam and got 100% on it without being able to read any words other than stop and slow and knowing

755
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:50,640
what the signs meant. The other things she did to her and money, they wanted extra money.

756
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:56,560
See, so she heard herself out from the strawberry seat and came around to pick strawberries.

757
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:02,960
That was a big thing in those days. And she picked strawberries about twice as fast as anyone else

758
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:08,000
because she knew how to sit on her home. She could do a line like a rabbit according to my

759
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,520
other signs. She could pick these strawberries and they were paid peaceways. She made more money than

760
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:22,800
anyone else picking strawberries. Well, they went back to Japan. I visited them there on a

761
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:36,000
most remarkable experience one time, but I'll tell you what happened to her. They moved in with

762
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,640
his parents and she had to play the subservient daughter on what I was there with a friend and

763
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:50,000
revisited them. We were invited to the old people's house and they were kimonos and as we came

764
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,800
in the door, we were professors. My friend and I and Macho was we finished the travel. That's

765
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:02,240
another story. They were on their knees, you know, with their heads down like this because we were

766
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:12,720
professors and we were assured in. But Motico, the wife of Macho, did not eat dinner with us.

767
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:20,560
She served as she was in the kitchen all the time. After the parents died and they took over

768
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:31,600
the house, she began to do watercoloring. And as time wand, her watercolors became very well-known

769
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:42,080
and then finally she became famous. When she died some years ago now, not many,

770
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:50,720
maybe five. She was the most talked about watercolors than all of Japan. They're paintings

771
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:58,080
are in museums and she made lots of money from her pain. Just an utterly remarkable couple.

772
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:10,160
I feel very fortunate to have known them. So that's he's the most remarkable postdoctoral

773
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:18,400
person I've had from these, I'm other people of scientifically excellent. Of course,

774
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:23,440
that's not really what I'm talking about. But in addition to the scientific excellence that

775
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:29,840
Macho had, he had all of the other things. They saved money while away here so they could buy

776
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:37,200
an American hot water heater and send it home and install in his parents' house so they would

777
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:44,320
have hot water. And when I came to visit them, they were very worried about toilet facilities

778
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:50,160
because they only had the traditional thing for a couple of porcelain raised footprints on a

779
01:43:50,160 --> 01:44:00,560
hole in the floor and you had the squat you see. So remarkable insight into Japanese living.

780
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:09,440
The occasion of this, I can tell you this visit to Japan with Macho,

781
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,680
all the votes Johnson, whom I mentioned before and I were in Japan for a meeting.

782
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:22,320
And preliminary to that meeting, we were asked by Macho or by some other the principal

783
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:26,560
sir, would we, would you like to do something ahead of time and I wrote and said yes,

784
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,440
we would like to look around Japan a bit a week ahead of time and there was a range that

785
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:37,840
Macho had a car now, it was employed by an institute and becoming a very well-known son of this,

786
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:46,000
we took this around in this car. And the one thing I said to him is that I didn't want to live in

787
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,120
any American, excuse me, or English style accommodations. And so I wanted to see what

788
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:59,040
Japan and particularly a rural Japan would like. So as we traveled around for seven days,

789
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:05,120
he had booked ahead of time, accommodations and Japanese ends. And all the time we were

790
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:12,080
traveling on this trip, I never saw another Caucasian in these ends in which we stayed.

791
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,760
We would come in, there would be a doorstep, we would be met with the hostess who would bow

792
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:28,640
and give us our kimono, you know, and take off our shoes, we would be ushered to our room

793
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:35,920
and some sort of small snuck bits after our travel would come. And then a few minutes later,

794
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:44,640
the person would come in and say, your bath is ready. The bath was not a char. It was a huge

795
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:51,680
place, this was more or less the norm. And there was a huge tub, it was about four feet deep,

796
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:58,800
and it would hold four or five people. And it was full of scalding water and you see it.

797
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:07,200
Then there, away from this tub, it's a tiled area with soap along the wall, and there's where

798
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:12,080
you wash yourself very thoroughly and rinse yourself, then you got into the tub to soak.

799
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:19,200
Then after a while, you'd get out again and repeat the process. That's what a Japanese,

800
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,400
that's what we were treated to. Well, then we got out and we were sort of,

801
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,360
how do you want to call totally relaxed with all of this? We're going to come on over, we came back in.

802
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,360
This was a Japanese room, no beds, nothing, you know, tautami on the floor, a rice door,

803
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:44,960
and then there would be the discreet knock and the horses would come in,

804
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,960
or one of the serving girls would come in and come on, bowing like this, set up a little table,

805
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:59,120
put the stuff on it, and sit there, and serve us, pour the sake for us. And my Japanese

806
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:05,920
we didn't begin a Japanese, of course, but my Japanese friend Macho would translate and he says,

807
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:14,160
if we like the service, we are, it is part of the process to offer her a drink of sake.

808
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:21,920
And so we did that and she bowed gracefully and drank sake very nicely. And then at the end,

809
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:26,640
they would plural us away and then they would haul out the tautami that you were going to sleep on,

810
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:31,440
bed, so to speak, the role, and that would be put out on the mat on the floor.

811
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:40,000
And there we would sleep. And at the end of every one of these rooms was a glass partition that

812
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:48,880
opened on to a private, very small, not bigger than this room, Japanese garden, beautifully planted with plants.

813
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:56,160
We went around a number of these places and on one occasion on a Saturday night, you know,

814
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:01,840
the Japanese, they're way out on the countryside. The men leave their family, they go out there and they have

815
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:08,480
drunken orgies. And one of these places we were on the second floor and I looked out the window

816
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:15,520
in the morning and on this beautiful green lawn, we're a number of recumbent forms sound asleep,

817
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:22,240
you know, where they had collapsed after a night of drinking inside. But Japanese don't look

818
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:28,240
at drunkenness in the same way that we do. I've walked through Kyoto and there will be a guy

819
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:34,320
lag on the sidewalk. The tops come along and very carefully, picking up by the armpits,

820
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:43,600
dragging up to the wall and probably moped right there and then walk on. Well, that's about as much as I

821
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:51,920
can tell you about that. But that trip is something few Americans have ever experienced and

822
01:48:52,800 --> 01:49:00,800
when I came back to Tokyo, Machio said, you know, if Lisa had come with you, we would have had none

823
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:07,520
of this service because she would have been expected to perform it. I told my wife that she said,

824
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:23,760
it's good she didn't come along. Well, I think the thing that I've most

825
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:31,120
proud of Chris is that I've had what I think is a very happy life and what I've done.

826
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:40,960
My childhood was, I won't say actually, I'm published, but we lived through the depression

827
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:48,320
on the portion of which my father was all to work and the notion that I would have been able

828
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:57,760
to do the things that I have been able to do would have been almost something above. For example,

829
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:05,040
I've traveled all over the world. I've made much more money than my father ever did and I have

830
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:12,800
kids that are successful and I've had wonderful colleagues and I've had a research career that

831
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:23,120
has kept me occupied even to date. I don't think I could have planned it any better actually

832
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:29,600
if I'd had to set out ahead of time. On the other hand, when you look back on a long life,

833
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:36,480
you see that there are certain points where you've made decisions that in retrospect you're very

834
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:44,880
happy with, but at the time it was almost a flip of the kind. For example, I very nearly married

835
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:52,400
somebody else before I met Lisa and decided not to. It was touching go. My whole life would have

836
01:50:52,400 --> 01:51:01,440
been different. I wouldn't have had any of the same connections, and Lisa's gifted scientist.

837
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:10,480
I wouldn't have had anywhere near the career I've had were it not for the many contributions

838
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:15,520
that she's made to it. We sat down last night and had a conversation about a problem I'm

839
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:30,000
having and we came to a conclusion about it. How it is. I don't know whether I mentioned this,

840
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,800
maybe I did when I got my full ride on Google and I'm fellow ships to Norway. The previous year

841
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:45,920
I had applied for a full ride fellowship. The application was received to late. If I'd gotten it,

842
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:51,840
which I was led to believe I would have, if I'd been received in time, I would have gone to Belgium.

843
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:59,120
I would never have had any of this Norwegian connection. My life would have been totally different.

844
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:09,200
Except for that week or so delay and getting the application in. When you're an old man like

845
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:18,800
me, you can think back on these career changing decisions that you made. All in all, I would say

846
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:28,560
that I just have a very happy life. It's still happy except I see my friends falling one by one.

847
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:35,360
That's the pressing experience. But come through us all.

848
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,920
Yeah, well, I've enjoyed it.
