1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
That's good.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,240
So, you would just start by having used the name and the date and other issues.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,040
My name is Steve Lawson.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,040
Today is August 26, 2011, and we're in a conference room at the Valley Library.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Okay.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,040
So, today we'll be talking primarily about your interactions with one of the following, specifically,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,040
trying to get a better sense of following sort of personal characteristics.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:48,040
But before we get into that, to be able to be able to talk to the world about your life, starting out with sort of a thumbnail and sketch of your biography before you into the FBI in 1991.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,040
I was born in Pennsylvania in 1951, and lived there for the first few years of life.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,040
I remember collecting donations for the Little League, World Championship, those typically held in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,040
And Little League is a big activity in that area of North Central Pennsylvania.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,040
We moved to Massachusetts along the coast north of Boston in the mid to late 1950s.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm not exactly sure of the date.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,040
But I went through elementary school in high school in Topfield, Massachusetts, which is a town in Essex County, very close to the sea coast.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:30,040
We lived in Ipswich, originally, which is a coastal town in Essex County.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:38,040
After graduating from high school, I went to Stanford University, and I was there in Palo Alto from 1969 to 1973.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I started work at the Linus Poly Institute of Science in Medicine in 1977, and took a full-time job there in February of 1978,

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
and had a number of different job titles there through the years.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Eventually, becoming Chief Executive Officer in 1993, about a year before Linus Poly died,

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,040
and I've worked at the Institute for most of my career.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,040
What do you do with all your interest in science or about the student in the career?

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Well, that's an interesting question.

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I was a little rudderless.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
I would say in college it was very difficult for me to focus on a career.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Some of my friends were very career oriented, and became physicians, lawyers,

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
went on to business school and so forth.

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,040
And that's pretty typical for an environment of academic excellence like Stanford University.

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
There are a lot of high achievers there.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,040
And I myself was a high achiever of course in high school.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,040
California was a big adventure for me coming from the relatively stayed and conventional east coast.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,040
And it was very wild time to be in California in 1969 through 1973, both culturally and politically.

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,040
It was a lot of anti-war activity in sentiments.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
And of course the counter-culture was really thriving in California at that time.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,040
In high school, I was very interested in science and took advanced calculus and physics and chemistry and biology.

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:14,040
With the idea of perhaps becoming an architect, which led me to apply to Rensalera Polytechnic Institute as one of my college choices,

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,040
because they had a very strong department of architecture.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Stanford at the time had a department of architecture as well.

41
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,040
And I decided ultimately to go to Stanford.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
And after I got there within a year, they had completely dismantled the department of architecture.

43
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,040
So that pretty much pulled the rug under, out from under me, would respect to that initial potential career choice.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I like science very much. I've always been very curious about nature and how things work.

45
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
And I think with respect to a career in the Linus Poly Institute,

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,040
although I was relatively naive about Linus Poly in high school and even in my early years in college,

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,040
I had been taking vitamin supplements beginning in high school.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Actually my mom gave me one-a-day multivitamin supplements beginning probably when I was just a kid.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,040
But then in the high school years, my friends and I got very interested in supplements.

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
And we're taking vitamin E and vitamin C and things like that.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,040
So the whole mission of the Linus Poly Institute really resonated with me.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,040
And that led me to a position there in 1977 that really was not science oriented at that time.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
It was more related to analysis of the direct mail program,

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,040
which had been implemented within a few years before I joined the Institute.

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,040
And it provided a relatively steady income for a lot of the non-grant supported research that was going on at the Institute,

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:58,040
which of course in those days was most of the Institute's research.

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:07,040
So between my graduation from Stanford and the time I joined the Institute,

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
it was a fairly carefree and adventurous time.

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:18,040
I spent a year after graduation traveling around the country visiting family and friends in Florida and Georgia and Maine and New England.

60
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I wanted to see the country, I had been very impressed with John Steinbeck's books,

61
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:32,040
travels with Charlie and others, and also Jack Carawak who grew up and is now buried in the same area in which I grew up in Massachusetts.

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:41,040
So both of those writers had a very strong influence, I think, on me and my desires for experience and adventure in the United States.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,040
When I returned to California after traveling around for a year or so,

64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,040
I took a series of jobs that really were not technical in nature at all.

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Cost of living in those days was very low, I think, for $100 a month, I could cover my living expenses quite easily.

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
And I was not, as I said, career-oriented at the time,

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,040
so I did not feel compelled to go to graduate school or begin a career in earnest at that time and I didn't.

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,040
It wasn't until I joined the Institute that I really started to focus more specifically on science,

69
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
which, at that time, really thrilled me.

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Were there any, you mentioned, your interest in supplements and your college diets in the pond was probably somewhere where I was at the time.

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
You've been graduated with, is that true?

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,040
And are there any other signs that are going on or something?

73
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Well, I began taking vitamins, probably, in an irregular way, when I was in high school.

74
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Probably, you've seen your high school in that continued on into my early years,

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
and college.

76
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Of course, Pauling had written vitamins in the common cold in 1970,

77
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
and friends of mine had open health food stores,

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,040
and had supplement products as part of their merchandise for sale.

79
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
So I was aware of this whole field early on,

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
without really knowing specifically much about wine as Pauling.

81
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
As a matter of fact, I knew very little of wine as Pauling,

82
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
even when I went to Stanford as a freshman,

83
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:15,040
it wasn't until probably about 1972 that I became more aware of him,

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
and it didn't have anything to do with science.

85
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,040
At the time, I don't believe he was teaching undergraduate courses in chemistry at Stanford,

86
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,040
which would have been my possible exposure to him.

87
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't think he was teaching graduate level courses at Stanford either.

88
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
But he was very politically active.

89
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
And of course, this was during the lot of pretty vehement,

90
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
anti-war protests around the country,

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
and Stanford was no exception to that kind of activity.

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,040
And in particular, there was a tenured professor of English,

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,040
H. Bruce Franklin, who was a Melville scholar,

94
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
one of the world's foremost authorities on Melville,

95
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
and has subsequently done a lot of work in recognizing science fiction

96
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,040
as an appropriate academic discipline for study.

97
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
And he had joined the Revolutionary Union,

98
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,040
and also Venser Amos, which was an organization I believe,

99
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
based in Redwood City, California.

100
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
They were very politically active.

101
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
They were kind of Maoist organizations,

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,040
and they really wanted not only an end to the Vietnam War,

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,040
but I think more dramatic upheaval in the federal government at that time.

104
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
And Stanford eventually had had enough of H. Bruce Franklin,

105
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,040
and considered, I think, some of his activities borderline legal,

106
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
and Franklin was getting in a lot of trouble,

107
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
and they decided to fire him.

108
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
And of course, he was a tenured professor,

109
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
so that was a big word deal,

110
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,040
and protocol that they had to work through in order to fire him.

111
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Stanford trustees at the time were quite conservative.

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
And I remember walking to class,

113
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
down at the quadrangle,

114
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Stanford, and I saw a protest outside the president's office,

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
and there were a group of undergraduates,

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,040
and other people assembled around a couple of people waving protest signs.

117
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,040
And the signs had something to do with the university had no right to fire,

118
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,040
a tenured professor for his political activity.

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
And I saw these two fellows holding these signs,

120
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
and they looked grandfatherly to me at the time,

121
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
and one was Linus Pauling,

122
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,040
and the other one I believe was Hal Holman,

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,040
who was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Stanford University Medical Center,

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
who was a liberal and a good friend of mine as Pauling's at the time.

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,040
And I remember being very impressed with the fact

126
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,040
that these two elderly gentlemen were taking the time

127
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
out from their busy schedules to go

128
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
and actually protest in front of the president's office.

129
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I thought that was quite remarkable,

130
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
because at that time,

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
most of the political activity was concentrated

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
among very young people.

133
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Sometimes it was very random and chaotic,

134
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
and incoated as well,

135
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
but I thought it was quite remarkable

136
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
that there were older people who were also interested in demonstrating

137
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,040
for the rights of people to express their political opinions.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
So that was my first,

139
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,040
that was really my first awareness of Linus Pauling,

140
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
was from the political perspective,

141
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
and not really from the scientific angle.

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
It wasn't until I joined the Linus Pauling Institute,

143
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
that I really became much more familiar with Linus Pauling's work

144
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,040
in chemistry and biology.

145
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, when I went to Stanford,

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
as I mentioned, I was very interested in architecture

147
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
as a potential career,

148
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
so I was taking engineering and architecture

149
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
while that department lasted.

150
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
And I also had kind of a Renaissance concept

151
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
of undergraduate education.

152
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I thought it was very important to take as many courses

153
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
in different subjects as possible,

154
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
so I was taking calculus, biology, and art history,

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
literature, and poetry, and just everything that I thought

156
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I should be exposed to as an undergraduate.

157
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I graduated with a degree in anthropology in 1973,

158
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
but I probably had almost enough credits

159
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
in biology for a degree in biology,

160
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,040
or at least a minor in biology.

161
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
And at the time, there were a couple of

162
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
pretty notorious professors at Stanford

163
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
who made a big impression on me.

164
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
One was Colin Pitt and Drake in the biology department.

165
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,040
He, I believe, also was director of the Hopkins Marine Station

166
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,040
in Monterey, taught a terrific course in biology,

167
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040
and also Cachadorian William Dement,

168
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040
taught a very popular course in Sleeping Dreams

169
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,040
that was very popular among undergraduates.

170
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Phil Pzambarro, of course, was teaching

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
popular psychology course at the time,

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
and he went on to some famous

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
the leader of the Stanford Prison Experiment,

174
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,040
which was quite influential at the time.

175
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
How did you come to know about

176
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
the land plans to do in the job of building whiteboards?

177
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Well, I had lived in Memo Park,

178
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
or Palo Alto for many years.

179
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
The Institute was founded in 1973

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
on Sandhill Road.

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Opposite the Stanford Linear Accelerator.

182
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
And at that time, that part of Sandhill Road,

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
primarily the northern side of Sandhill Road,

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,040
headed west, was a series of relatively new buildings

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
on Tom Ford property.

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
He was a trustee of Stanford University.

187
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
And there were publishing companies

188
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,040
and real estate companies and insurance companies.

189
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Now, that area is a hive of venture capitalist activity.

190
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
But the Institute, in those days,

191
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,040
I believe a 2700 Sandhill Road shared

192
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
relatively modern office building

193
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
with Kemper Insurance Company.

194
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
And I was aware of the sign out on the street.

195
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
So I'd driven by there many times

196
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
on my way to the coastal range or to the beach.

197
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,040
And I think that, if I remember correctly,

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
I saw an advertisement in the paper,

199
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
specifically for a job without a lot of detail

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
description about the nature of the job.

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
And I went to interview at the Linear's Plan

202
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Institute of Science in Medicine and interviewed

203
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,040
with Art Robinson, who was then the president

204
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
and director of the Institute.

205
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
And he hired me.

206
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Do you recall the first time you met my phone?

207
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Well, the first time I saw him, of course,

208
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
was, as I said, back in about probably 1972,

209
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,040
when he was demonstrating against the firing

210
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
of H. Bruce Franklin.

211
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,040
I met him in 1977 because my office

212
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
was just off the hallway that Pauling took to get to his office,

213
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
which was adjacent to Art Robinson's office,

214
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
and also the accountant and controller

215
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
were down at the end of that office as well.

216
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
And he was very aware of who was working

217
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
at the Institute and what all the activities were

218
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
and he stopped to introduce himself to me

219
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
when I was sitting in my office one day.

220
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,040
And of course, I had remembered him from Stanford.

221
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
And I had become more aware of his scientific legend,

222
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
of course, by then, by working

223
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
at the Linear's Plan Institute.

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
And I was also aware of the fact that this was his Institute

225
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
and he was named after him.

226
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
So, of course, I had, I had high regard for him

227
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
as being the founder of this organization

228
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
that I was now working for.

229
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,040
But he impressed me as a very warm, charming,

230
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
very friendly person.

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
He was not cerebral or distant at all,

232
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
not a Louvre.

233
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
He was very, very welcoming.

234
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,040
What's he frequently around the Institute

235
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
and I know he traveled a lot,

236
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,040
but he recall him being a regular friend.

237
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
He did travel quite a lot, but I do remember him

238
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
being a regular presence.

239
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Certainly when he was in town,

240
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
he would come by the Institute that was his office

241
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
and his main base of operations.

242
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,040
And if he had to do interviews or see guests,

243
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,040
it was typically at the Linear's Plan Institute in his office.

244
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
And I remember meeting many of his friends at that time,

245
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,040
including an emissary from St. George's Lab at Woods Hole.

246
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I believe his name was.

247
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,040
I can't think of his name right now.

248
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It started with a P.

249
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,040
It was very interested in telling us

250
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,040
about St. George's new theories regarding vitamin C

251
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
and the electronic basis of life.

252
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Vitamin C is an electron donor being very essential

253
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
to life far above its role in preventing scurvy

254
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
or as an antioxidant.

255
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Dorothy Hodgkin also came through the Institute at that time

256
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,040
and it was fairly soon after I arrived at the Institute

257
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
that I also met you in Cameron,

258
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
who of course was a Scottish surgeon

259
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
who was collaborating intensively with one

260
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,040
as Pauling on vitamin C and cancer work.

261
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I did.

262
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
I met Dorothy Hodgkin.

263
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,040
At that time, I believe I was working in the laboratory.

264
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I had begun a friendship with a biochemist named Alan Sheets

265
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
at the Institute as well as Dick Willaby.

266
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
He was a biologist working on the skin cancer

267
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,040
and vitamin C experiments that Pauling had designed

268
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
and were being carried out by Art Robinson at the time.

269
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,040
As arts influence in the Institute started to wane,

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,040
people responsible for a lot of the biological biochemical work

271
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,040
were encouraging me to get more involved in that work.

272
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I seemed to have the aptitude for it.

273
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
I was quite interested in it.

274
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
I moved out of the role that I was originally hired

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
to perform at the Institute,

276
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
which was the direct male solicitation work and analysis,

277
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,040
into kind of a research assistant position in the labs.

278
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
That led me to come in contact with people that Pauling

279
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,040
would bring through the laboratory to show them the work

280
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
that we were doing.

281
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Bill Aberth at the time was running a volcano source

282
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
of the organization, Mass Spectrometer,

283
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
which was used for metabolite profiling,

284
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,040
which was a big chunk of the Institute's research at the time.

285
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,040
So people were always interested in coming down to the first floor

286
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
and seeing that group Goldberg contraption,

287
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
which was always undergoing tinkering.

288
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Never seemed to be quite ready for routine biochemical experimentation.

289
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
And since I was working in the laboratory at that time,

290
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I would meet people that Pauling would bring through the laboratory

291
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
and one of them would dorthy Hodgkin.

292
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,040
So Pauling, you were hired in 1977 and LPI

293
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,040
and have built a career there of Pauling live

294
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
until 1994.

295
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
So at that time, in the year period,

296
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I'm wondering if you can just generally characterize

297
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
your relationship with Pauling already all over the year.

298
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Sure.

299
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Well, originally I saw little of him

300
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
because my work did really not overlap

301
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
with his research interests.

302
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I mean, of course, he was heavily involved

303
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,040
in the financial status in the Institute.

304
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
And Art Robinson was the main force

305
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
behind the direct mail solicitation program.

306
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
But Pauling was certainly aware of that.

307
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,040
And once I started working in the laboratory

308
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,040
more, we had more to talk about.

309
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,040
And I became heavily involved in the skin cancer

310
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
and hairless mice program, which was testing the effect

311
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,040
of different levels of vitamin C in a mouse child diet

312
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
on the development of skin cancer

313
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,040
in hairless mice exposed ultraviolet light.

314
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
And other arms of those experiments

315
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
and there were a number of experiments that took place

316
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,040
over a number of years.

317
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Some of the other arms of that project

318
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
involve feeding raw food and nuts

319
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
to mice to see whether that also

320
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
inhibited the development of skin cancer

321
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,040
when the mice were exposed to ultraviolet light.

322
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
So the mice were given things like carrots

323
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
and pears and sunflower seeds

324
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,040
and tomatoes and other raw food

325
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
to find out what effect that would have.

326
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,040
And when Art Robinson left,

327
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Pauling, of course, was interested in finding out

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
how this work was going.

329
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
And he asked me to, I believe the first project

330
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
that he asked me specifically to get involved

331
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,040
and was to calculate the amount of certain micronutrients

332
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,040
in the food that these mice were fed.

333
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Because as scientists, we tend to be a little reductionist.

334
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
We want to find out if there is an effect

335
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
with the whole food, then what is it in the food

336
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
that might be protective?

337
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,040
So that was a very challenging project

338
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
that Pauling gave to me.

339
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
And I was a bit frustrated

340
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,040
because the way that the food had been provided

341
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,040
to the mice made it very difficult

342
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
to determine how much an individual mouse

343
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,040
consumed of any particular food stuff.

344
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
The mice were also caged five to a cage.

345
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,040
And there were social patterns that developed

346
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
of hierarchy that developed within the cage.

347
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
So there were dominant mice

348
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,040
who would eat the preferred food.

349
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
And then the less dominant mice would get

350
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
was left.

351
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
So there was some competition for the best food,

352
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
the most flavorful food for the mice.

353
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
The way the food was provided to them

354
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,040
was sometimes as a mush ground up

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,040
or blended food and sometimes as chunks of carrots

356
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
and peppers and so forth.

357
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
The sunflower seeds were given to them

358
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
and small glass containers

359
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,040
with metal lids that had a hole in them.

360
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
And the mice would spray the sunflower seeds

361
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
out all over the place.

362
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
And it was really impossible to determine

363
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,040
the intake of any of these foods for specific animal.

364
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
And even for a cage of animals,

365
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
divided by five was really not appropriate.

366
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Calculation.

367
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
There was a lot of waste.

368
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
So a lot of the food would fall through

369
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,040
the mesh to the floor, to the cage rack.

370
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
And sometimes they would defecate

371
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,040
and urinate in the sunflower seed containers

372
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
or as well.

373
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
And then wouldn't continue to eat

374
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,040
once they'd already defecated or urinated in that container.

375
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
There were other issues as well.

376
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,040
For instance, the vitamin A content of carrots

377
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,040
can differ appreciably depending upon how long the carrots

378
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
are stored after they've been picked.

379
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
And that was something that was not measured at the time.

380
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
So there was no analysis,

381
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
biochemical analysis of the food

382
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
that was provided to the animals.

383
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
And depending upon the variety,

384
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,040
ripeness, length of time,

385
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
something that had been stored,

386
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
whether it was refrigerated or stored at room temperature,

387
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
the micronutrient content of the foodstuffs

388
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
provided to the mice can vary appreciably.

389
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,040
So I made the calculations,

390
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
and I sat down with Linus Pong and told them

391
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
that in my estimation it was really impossible to glean

392
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,040
any really useful detailed information about the micronutrient intake

393
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
of these animals.

394
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,040
And the best we could do was say that the raw food diet

395
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
seemed to be protective,

396
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
but it was just too difficult to determine

397
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,040
what constituents the raw food diet conferred that protection.

398
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
So it was a little bit,

399
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I was a little bit ambivalent about that.

400
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I think I did a very thorough and good job

401
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
in making these determinations,

402
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
but ultimately what I had to say was a little bit

403
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
disappointing, I think.

404
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
And how did he react to that?

405
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
He didn't react with disappointment.

406
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
He reacted as presenting him with facts and calculations,

407
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,040
and he was very seemed very pleased to get the information.

408
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
It was not long after that that you and Cameron

409
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
began spending quite a lot more time

410
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
at the Institute,

411
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,040
and I believe that taking an apartment nearby

412
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
maybe Redwood City.

413
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,040
And Cameron of course was very interested

414
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,040
in high dose vitamin C as a jumped of therapy and cancer,

415
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
as was falling,

416
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,040
and they had done some clinical work together

417
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
over the years,

418
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
beginning probably in 1971,

419
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
1972,

420
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
so it even preceded the founding of the Linus

421
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

422
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,040
And Cameron was concerned with some of the practical issues

423
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,040
about the administration of high dose vitamin C

424
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,040
patients who might also be taking chemotherapy

425
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
to drugs,

426
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,040
and we know that vitamin C has some general detoxification properties,

427
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
and Cameron specifically was concerned

428
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,040
that if people were taking chemotherapy to drugs,

429
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
then should they take high dose vitamin C

430
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
at the same time,

431
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
which might have an effect on the efficacy

432
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
of the chemotherapy to drugs.

433
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
So he didn't want to recommend to people

434
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,040
that they take high dose vitamin C while taking chemotherapy,

435
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,040
if the vitamin C was going to somehow

436
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
adversely affect these drugs.

437
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
So he wanted to find a way to study this,

438
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,040
and in association with Linus Poly and Alan Sheets,

439
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,040
we came up with the idea of using fish toxicology experiments,

440
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,040
which is a pretty well-established model for studying pollution

441
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,040
and streams and lakes and bodies of water and things like that.

442
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,040
So we read a lot about fish toxicology,

443
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Alan and I figured out how to reconstitute water

444
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,040
from distilled water by adding back certain salts

445
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,040
to provide the proper habitat for fingerling trout.

446
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,040
And the idea was that we would have fingerling trout

447
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,040
that would be exposed to vitamin C

448
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,040
and chemotherapy of drugs dissolved

449
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
in their water that they were living in.

450
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,040
And we would monitor any observable effects in the fish,

451
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
and we hypothesized that they would be detected

452
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
by abnormal behavior in the fish,

453
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
which would have to do with the way they swim,

454
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
the distance that they cover in a certain period of time,

455
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
and so forth.

456
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
So there was some technology that was also developed

457
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,040
to make these kinds of measurements.

458
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
So that was another project that I worked with,

459
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
U and Cameron Anlan is following.

460
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Unfortunately, we had to vacate the building

461
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,040
at 2700 Sandhill Road in Menlo Park,

462
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,040
ostensibly because there had been cracks in the building

463
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,040
due to smaller earthquakes over time.

464
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
It wasn't a building that was set on bedrock.

465
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
It was on loose soil.

466
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,040
And the landlord wanted to get the tenants out,

467
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
make some structural corrections in the building.

468
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
And I don't think the landlord was overly excited

469
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
by a laboratory in the building anyway.

470
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,040
We were sharing the building with camper insurance company,

471
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,040
and I think he was more happy with having nice dry insurance company,

472
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,040
and having wet labs there with animal experiments,

473
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
and physics experiments and so forth.

474
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,040
So those experiments had to be wrapped up

475
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
before we really brought them to fruition,

476
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,040
before we moved to the facility at 440 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto.

477
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Were there other sites of the collaboration

478
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
that were following over the course of the relationship?

479
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
There were.

480
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
He would come into my office from time to time,

481
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,040
and we would talk about ideas he had,

482
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
different projects that he was interested in.

483
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Occasionally he would ask me if I would be interested

484
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
in doing something like writing a book review,

485
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
which was a little surprising.

486
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
When Evelyn Richards book,

487
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Vitamin C and Cancer Medicine or Politics,

488
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,040
was published, I believe, in 1991 or 1992,

489
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Linus Pauline came into my office with a copy of the book,

490
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
and asked me if I would be interested in writing a book review

491
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
to be submitted to a nutrition journal.

492
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
And I, of course, said yes,

493
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
and wrote the review, which was subsequently published

494
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
in a nutrition journal.

495
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Later, and of course I would go into his office

496
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
from time to time, and talk with him about different things.

497
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
The quantum chemist by the name of Zella Carmen,

498
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
who was collaborating with Pauline and problems

499
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,040
in theoretical chemistry and physics,

500
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,040
over the whole period in the late 1970s through Pauline's death.

501
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Zella Carmen and I were both rockhounds.

502
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
We had collected rocks and minerals,

503
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
and we were kids, and we knew that Pauline was

504
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,040
a great mineralologist, and understood a lot

505
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
about the silicate minerals, which are quite interesting.

506
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,040
So the three of us would amuse ourselves occasionally

507
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,040
by Zella Carmen, I would bring in some of our minerals

508
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
specimens, and we would sit in Pauline's office,

509
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
and try to stump the expert, essentially.

510
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Sometimes Zella Carmen, I would have forgotten

511
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
the identifications of some of the minerals we had,

512
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
so they would be presented to Dr. Pauline

513
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
to see if he could identify them.

514
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It was astonishing, because even though he

515
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
had probably not thought about some of these things

516
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
in many, many years or even decades,

517
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,040
he infallibly was able to identify the mineral

518
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
and make a fairly quick identification.

519
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
So that was fun.

520
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
It didn't have anything to do with any of the research

521
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,040
going on at the Institute, but it was very fun

522
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,040
to sit and talk with him in that way.

523
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Later in the late 1980s,

524
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,040
and I'm going to say probably around 1988,

525
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Pauline came into my office with an idea

526
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,040
for a new technique to fabricate superconductive material.

527
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,040
And this was during kind of a heyday

528
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,040
or a resurgence of interest in ceramic superconductors.

529
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,040
But Pauline had a vastly different idea,

530
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
which had to do with the way a material

531
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
could be fabricated, and perhaps that would raise

532
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,040
the temperature which would be superconductive.

533
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
And it had to do with, excuse me,

534
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
phone on dampening.

535
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
And his idea was that if you could have

536
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,040
a conductive metal like tin,

537
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,040
drawn to an incredibly fine fibro, as he called it,

538
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
maybe 10 or 20 angstroms in diameter,

539
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
surrounded by insulating material like glass,

540
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,040
then the superconductive temperature of the tin

541
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,040
would be increased, the TC of the tin would be raised.

542
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,040
And he talked with me about some ideas that he had

543
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
and how to make this material,

544
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,040
which I believe would be important in supporting

545
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,040
a patent application that he wanted to file.

546
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,040
And his goal, I think, in filing this patent application,

547
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
as he described it to me and others,

548
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,040
was to generate a stable revenue source

549
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
for the institute.

550
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,040
So he wasn't interested in acquiring wealth on his own.

551
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
But he wasn't interested in looking for

552
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
revenue sources for the institute,

553
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,040
which had lurched from one financial crisis

554
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
throughout my whole tenure,

555
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
and as far as the two designs in medicine.

556
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,040
And he thought that this might be something

557
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,040
that could be licensed and would generate lots of income.

558
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,040
So Zella Kerman and I set up a laboratory

559
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
at Stanford Industrial Park at a least facility

560
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,040
that the institute had on Porter Drive,

561
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
which also has the Susikaawa Aging Research

562
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,040
facility in some storage area.

563
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,040
And we set up a laboratory bought an oven,

564
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
some torches, blow torches, compress gas,

565
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,040
borosilicate glass, tin,

566
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,040
and Zika developed a very interesting way

567
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
to collect the material that we were going to produce,

568
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,040
which was a bicycle inverted on a block of wood.

569
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,040
And we had taken the rubber tire off the bike rim,

570
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,040
and we wanted to collect this glass-clad

571
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
fibrill of tin that we would generate

572
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,040
with torches above the furnace,

573
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,040
and then connect it to the bicycle wheel

574
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,040
and then use the petals or a crank to turn the bicycle rim

575
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,040
and then we would collect in a circular fashion,

576
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,040
this long piece of glass that was filled with tin.

577
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
So there was a lot of trial and error involved in that,

578
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,040
and you and Kerman was aware of what we were doing as well.

579
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040
We developed kind of a special interest in this as well.

580
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,040
So you and Kerman and Zella Kerman and I spent quite a lot of time

581
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,040
in this laboratory at Porter Drive trying to produce this material.

582
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,040
And it was interesting, in another way, as well,

583
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,040
in that pollen was very interested in seeing the laboratory notebooks,

584
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,040
and wanted to be sure that we were taking copious and meticulous notes

585
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
on what we were doing.

586
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Between notebook page, for instance, had to be signed and dated,

587
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,040
and then periodically, I believe, once a week or once every two weeks.

588
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Someone who was not associated with a project was asked to read

589
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,040
what had been put in the laboratory notebook and countersign it.

590
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
So typically, we asked him,

591
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,040
who was the president and the institute at that time,

592
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,040
to read what we'd written in the lab notebook,

593
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
and then he would countersign it and dated as well.

594
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Which was when I was working as a scientist at the institute,

595
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,040
I was aware of how important it is to maintain good protocol

596
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,040
and filling up data and laboratory notebooks.

597
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
You don't erase things, you cross them out,

598
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
glue or tape things in, use pen, date and so forth.

599
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,040
So that in the future, people who are unfamiliar with your work

600
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,040
could theoretically be able to go back and repeat what you've done

601
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,040
based only on the information provided in the lab notebook.

602
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,040
And that was, that concept was really driven home through this work

603
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,040
for Linus Pauline, because he was very interested in us maintaining

604
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,040
very meticulous laboratory notebook,

605
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
which we did, and he was quite happy with it.

606
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
And after many months of trial and error,

607
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,040
and kind of a sophisticated development of this technique,

608
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,040
an examination of the product through high power magnification,

609
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,040
we were able to come up with material that we thought would be suitable.

610
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
It needed to be tested, of course, to see whether or not

611
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,040
the superconductive temperature had changed,

612
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
but Pauline was just ecstatic.

613
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,040
At that time, he was an apartment in Stanford,

614
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,040
and we Zeke and I were very excited,

615
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,040
and we brought a sample of this down to his apartment,

616
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
and he himself was very excited.

617
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:57,040
It was, I can imagine that he exhibited this kind of emotion.

618
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Many times throughout his life whenever he made an important scientific discovery

619
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,040
or became aware of an important discovery that influenced his own work,

620
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,040
but he just looked joyful, and he immediately went over to the mantle,

621
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
fireplace, and got a big cubic pirate crystal,

622
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
and gave one to me, and gave something to Zeke,

623
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,040
and then said, be sure to bring your copies of General Chemistry in,

624
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,040
and unscribed them on the occasion of this happy discovery

625
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
and invention that we've made.

626
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,040
And that work formed the basis for his patent application,

627
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,040
and I believe his patent for novel technique for fabricating

628
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,040
superconductive material was awarded in perhaps 1991.

629
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I think there were initial applications submitted as early as 1988, 1989,

630
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,040
but I think that the final application was granted.

631
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,040
The final patent was granted in 1991.

632
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Were that technique ever employed on any of them?

633
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Well, it would turned out to be very difficult to measure changes

634
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
in superconductivity in this material,

635
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,040
because if you can imagine getting an appropriate contact

636
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,040
between the end of this tin fibril,

637
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
it was maybe 10 to 20 extras in diameter,

638
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
it was extremely difficult.

639
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
We sent the material off to General Electric,

640
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
and it's connected.

641
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,040
He had contact that a number of his friends in industry

642
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,040
to find out if they had equipment that might be capable

643
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,040
of measuring, making these measurements for us.

644
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
So there were problems in actually making the measurements.

645
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
But the vice president of the Institute, Rick Hicks, at the time,

646
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
felt that since we had the patent in hand,

647
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,040
we should try to license it.

648
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
So he embarked on a process of trying to identify

649
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,040
companies in the United States that might be interesting

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
and licensing this technology.

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,040
And he wasn't having much success in this country.

652
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
He went to Japan, I believe,

653
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,040
and probably about 1991 or 1992,

654
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
and tried to shop it around there.

655
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Also, I'm sure there was interest express,

656
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,040
but there was nothing that was really consummated at the time.

657
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,040
And it led to kind of an interesting exchange.

658
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,040
And at the same time, later, when Rick had returned

659
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,040
from Asia, some months had gone by,

660
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Emil Zukakondo called me on the intercom,

661
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
if I would come down to his office

662
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
because we had a visitor.

663
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
And I went down to his office,

664
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,040
and we had someone there from the Central Intelligence Agency,

665
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
who was very interested in this particular invention,

666
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,040
and wanted to know why we were shopping this around in Japan,

667
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,040
and in other countries, rather than the United States.

668
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
And I explained to him that, well, the reason was,

669
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
we hadn't been able to find anyone in the United States

670
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
who was interested.

671
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,040
I thought it was quite interesting,

672
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,040
that the CIA seemed to know about this.

673
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
That was pretty much the end of that.

674
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,040
I think there was a misque later

675
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,040
that had to do with the turmoil surrounding

676
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Pauling's death and succession of people in charge of the Institute

677
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,040
and files being shifted around and so forth.

678
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,040
And somehow the application to continue the maintenance fee

679
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
on that particular patent fell through the cracks.

680
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,040
So I think that the reason that it died effectively

681
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,040
was because the maintenance fee was not paid unfortunately.

682
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Or any other site of the collaborations of no one?

683
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Not really.

684
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I think that the Vitamin C and Skin Cancer experiments,

685
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
of course, I was co-author of one of the papers

686
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,040
that resulted from that work.

687
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
And in the superconductive material,

688
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,040
were the two major collaborations?

689
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,040
How do you describe Pauling's style of the scientists

690
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
and what you use there for it?

691
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Think in greatest strengths in the scientists?

692
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040
Well, he, as many people have remarked,

693
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,040
had an encyclopedic knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology,

694
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,040
perhaps medicine, mathematics, statistics,

695
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
had an incredibly good grasp of statistics.

696
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
And that served him very well, I think, as a scientist,

697
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,040
because he was, as I like to say, perhaps the best embodiment

698
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,040
of the multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary attack

699
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
on scientific problems.

700
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,040
And of course, that's a buzzword in science today.

701
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,040
And that's what the NIH and funding agencies encourage,

702
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
just kind of team activity.

703
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,040
But it was remarkable that this kind of knowledge,

704
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
expansive and encyclopedic knowledge,

705
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,040
was exhibited in one particular person in line

706
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,040
as Pauling, which I think was quite remarkable.

707
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,040
So his memory, as well, is ability to extract references

708
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
and facts and material from other papers and so forth,

709
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
or it's being most of his life, was quite remarkable.

710
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,040
So I think those two things served him incredibly well

711
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
as a scientist.

712
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,040
And I saw that in action many times when he could cite

713
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
other literature and talk about what other people had found

714
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
and so forth.

715
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,040
So I was very impressed by his grasp of science

716
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
in his memory.

717
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,040
And he also struck me as being very courageous.

718
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
As I said earlier, my first exposure to him

719
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,040
in the political arena, I thought he was quite courageous

720
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
at that time.

721
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Later I became aware of just how courageous he was

722
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
when he was facing the U.S. Senate

723
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,040
with respect to allegations of his lack of patriotism

724
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
or something like that.

725
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,040
And he basically stood them down, which I thought

726
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
was incredibly courageous.

727
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,040
And in another sense, he was a very courageous scientist.

728
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
When Zalik and I were working with this furnace

729
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,040
in the late 1980s at Porter Drive,

730
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Pauling would come up from time to time.

731
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,040
And one time in particular he put on a lab coat

732
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,040
and put on gloves and goggles and was wielding the torch

733
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
about the 800 degree furnace as well.

734
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,040
He was actively engaged in this experimental project,

735
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
which I thought was quite extraordinary.

736
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,040
So he didn't really prefer to just sit at his desk

737
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
and think about things.

738
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
He also wanted to get hands on

739
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
when something really intrigued him or interested in.

740
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,040
And during the mouse, skin cancer experiments as well,

741
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
he would often come through the laboratory

742
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
just to check on things, see how things were going,

743
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
ask people questions about the work that was underway

744
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
and so forth.

745
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
He was not removed from the experimental side of things,

746
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,040
although clearly he was involved in a lot of other things

747
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
and didn't actually participate physically

748
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
in a lot of the experimental work in those days.

749
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,040
He wasn't a stranger in the laboratory.

750
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
And I witnessed that firsthand with the work

751
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
on superconductivity where he actually was

752
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
engaged experimentally.

753
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,040
And I think that was probably the last experimental work

754
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
that he was engaged in.

755
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
Because at that time he probably would have been

756
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
in his late 1980s.

757
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,040
So he was in his late 80s as well.

758
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,040
Over time, you, you are all these

759
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,040
who changed from that of scientific research

760
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
or who are more of the administrator.

761
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
And I'm wondering if you engage in

762
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
other different kinds of work with calling

763
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
and that context of the administrative.

764
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm very much so.

765
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I had been asked to become a assistant to the president

766
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
when he knew who could come.

767
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
There was president of the Institute.

768
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
At the time I was co-director with a meal

769
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,040
of the laboratory for research and gene regulation.

770
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
And we had a small research group.

771
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,040
We were looking at problems and cancer metastasis

772
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
using protein profiling techniques,

773
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
which had just recently been developed.

774
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
And we were developing instrumentation

775
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,040
that would allow us to increase reproducibility

776
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,040
and reduce noise in the experimental procedure.

777
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
And we were very interested in discovering

778
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
genes and proteins that might correlate

779
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
with the metastatic, the development

780
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
of the metastatic phenotype in both

781
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
myrine and human cancer cells.

782
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Excuse me.

783
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,040
So I was also working a bit

784
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
administratively with a meal zucacondal

785
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
at that time.

786
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
And then when a meal retired from the Institute

787
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,040
on the occasion of his birthday,

788
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,040
there was quite a lot of turmoil at the Institute

789
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
because there are a number of problems.

790
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
One problem was the Institute

791
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
as I mentioned earlier, had a history of

792
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
financial instability.

793
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
And over the years, under a meal's direction,

794
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
the Institute expanded quite significantly

795
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,040
to include some projects that probably would not

796
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,040
be considered strictly in the realm of

797
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
orthomolecular medicine, of course,

798
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
in the following's.

799
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Most, I think, the reason he set up the Institute

800
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
to begin with and something that he was

801
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,040
he felt strongest about.

802
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,040
So I think a meal may have had a desire

803
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,040
for the Institute to become a more comprehensive

804
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Institute of Molecular Biological

805
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,040
and Chemical and Biological Sciences,

806
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
similar to the Salk Institute,

807
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
down in Southern California,

808
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
which is a fine template,

809
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,040
and there weren't enough grants

810
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,040
one by Institute staff

811
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,040
to support all the varied activities

812
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
that were going on.

813
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
So, concomitant with Amel's retirement

814
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
and retirement of Rick Hicks from the Institute,

815
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,040
there was a shift in focusing the Institute

816
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
and the Board of Trustees decided

817
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,040
that there really weren't enough funds

818
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,040
to sustain all the varied programs

819
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
underweight Institute.

820
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
So the idea was to pair back

821
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
some of the strictly molecular biological work

822
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
that wasn't funded

823
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
extramararily by government grants from DOE

824
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,040
or NIH or NCI or whatever.

825
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
And refocus, specifically on

826
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,040
orthomolecular medicine.

827
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,040
And at about that time,

828
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Linus Pong had begun a friendship

829
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
and scientific collaboration

830
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
with a German cardiologist,

831
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Matthias Rat, who

832
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,040
together with Pong had developed some

833
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
interesting hypotheses about the relationship

834
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
of lipoprotein A,

835
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
which is a risk factor for

836
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
orthosclerosis and a major

837
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
constituent of atherosclerotic plaque

838
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
and vitamin C.

839
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
And they published a number of hypothesis papers

840
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
of very famous one being in PNAS

841
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
and developed,

842
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
decided to set up a laboratory

843
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,040
for cardiovascular disease research

844
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
that was directed by Dr. Rat.

845
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,040
And Pong was very excited about this work.

846
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
When, at some point,

847
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
and I don't remember the exact time

848
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
but it was after a meal had retired

849
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
and Pong became for short time.

850
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
The president and director of the Institute

851
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
after a meal.

852
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,040
He asked me to become his assistant

853
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
and I wasn't quite sure what

854
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
that meant.

855
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
So I had written him a note

856
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,040
or memo asking him what he wanted me to do

857
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
and I had some ideas

858
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
mainly of administrative nature

859
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
as to things that I thought

860
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,040
could result in big improvements

861
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
and the way the Institute

862
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,040
was run and our status, financial status

863
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
and other issues.

864
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
But he disappeared to Big Sur

865
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
to his ranch down

866
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
on the coast of California

867
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
for some time.

868
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
And I felt a little adrift.

869
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
And by this time

870
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
I got into no line

871
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,040
as Pong Jr.

872
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,040
fairly well because he was

873
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
I think in the process of

874
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,040
getting more actively involved

875
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
in the administration of the Institute

876
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040
because he recognized

877
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
his father was ill.

878
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
And there were a lot of problems

879
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
at the Institute

880
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,040
and he felt he should step

881
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
into help his father,

882
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
which I thought was very commendable.

883
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,040
And eventually I became

884
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
the executive officer at the Institute

885
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
which was similar

886
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,040
in function to being president

887
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
in the Institute.

888
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
And later the board appointed me

889
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,040
Chief Executive Officer

890
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
I think in about 1993

891
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,040
technically I became Chief Executive Officer.

892
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
So throughout this period

893
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
where I functioned in different

894
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
administrative roles

895
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
I worked very closely

896
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
with Linus Pong Jr.

897
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
The Board of Trustees,

898
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
and of course by that time

899
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Linus Pong had become chairman

900
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,040
of the Board of Trustees

901
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
and Director of Research at the Institute

902
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
but didn't really have

903
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
an administrative role

904
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
any longer in the Linus Pong Institute

905
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
to the Science and Medicine

906
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
because I think everyone felt

907
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,040
that it would be best

908
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
if he were spared

909
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
the problems that we had

910
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
to resolve.

911
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
And there were problems

912
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,040
concerning relocation.

913
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
It was a zoning issue

914
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
where the least property

915
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
on which our building was situated

916
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
at 440 Page of Mill Road

917
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,040
in Palo Alto

918
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
was scheduled to

919
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
change from commercial

920
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
to residential zoning

921
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
quite quickly

922
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
and no long range plans

923
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
had really been developed

924
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
to deal with that zoning change

925
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,040
and we didn't have an endowment

926
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,040
had very little money.

927
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,040
So the prospect of moving

928
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,040
the Institute

929
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,040
trying to keep it intact

930
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,040
and the mid peninsula

931
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
but paying maybe 10 or 20 times

932
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
more in rent

933
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,040
was not very

934
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
encouraging

935
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
and Linus Pong himself

936
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,040
of course had been diagnosed

937
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
with prostate cancer

938
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,040
and although he was undergoing

939
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,040
a number of different

940
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
experimental therapies

941
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,040
it was not believed

942
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
that he would survive

943
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
his illness

944
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
and we were very concerned

945
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
about what would happen

946
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,040
to the Institute

947
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
after his death

948
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
would we would be able

949
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
to continue to raise money

950
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
to support the Institute

951
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
as a viable research organization

952
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,040
and then of course

953
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,040
there were lawsuits

954
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,040
and there was quite a lot

955
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
of litigation at that time

956
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,040
the T.S. rat had left the Institute

957
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
and it sued the Institute

958
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
for infringement

959
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
and his business activities

960
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,040
and also sued Linus Pong

961
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,040
so I had to manage

962
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
a lot of our litigation

963
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
at that time as well.

964
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,040
So my role

965
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
at the time

966
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
the big challenges

967
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
were finding a future home

968
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
or at least the disposition

969
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
of the Linus Pong Institute

970
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
to the science and medicine

971
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
keeping it intact

972
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
and reputable

973
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
and also managing our litigation

974
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
which was very burdensome

975
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
and took

976
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
absorbed a lot of my time

977
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
and a lot of the board's time as well

978
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,040
but Pauling was largely spared from that.

979
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
I mean he was deposed

980
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
of course

981
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,040
a number of times

982
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
but

983
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,040
I managed a lot of our legal affairs at that time

984
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
in close association

985
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,040
from Linus Pong Institute

986
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,040
the chairman of the board

987
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
and at that time we had

988
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
very regular board meetings as well

989
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,040
so the Board of Trustees

990
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
was kept well-apprised

991
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
of all the activities

992
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
and their opinions were solicited

993
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
and many of these activities as well

994
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
so

995
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,040
it was a very challenging time for me

996
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,040
I was surprised to be honest

997
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,040
when the board asked me

998
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
to become chief executive officer

999
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,040
because it kind of came out of the blue

1000
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
the work that I was doing

1001
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
with a musicer condo

1002
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,040
was not really related

1003
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,040
to work the molecular medicine

1004
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
wasn't related to vitamin C at the time

1005
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
as I said

1006
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
we were looking at metastatic cancer

1007
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
which really had nothing to do

1008
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,040
with the molecular medicine

1009
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
so I was concerned

1010
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
that my group and my job

1011
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
were in jeopardy as well

1012
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
because

1013
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,040
there were rumors circulating

1014
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,040
that the board wanted to refocus

1015
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,040
on North Molecular Medicine

1016
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
and since my work

1017
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
wasn't involved in North Molecular Medicine

1018
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
I thought

1019
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
perhaps I might be laid off

1020
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
from the Institute as well

1021
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
at about the same time

1022
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
a musicer condo wanted to

1023
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
collect

1024
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
some of the people who were doing

1025
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
molecular biological work

1026
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
in a new institute

1027
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,040
called the Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences

1028
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
which he

1029
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,040
hoped to rent space

1030
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,040
from the Lyon's Plan Institute of Science

1031
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
and Medicine in the same building

1032
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
so I spent quite a lot of time

1033
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
as executive officer

1034
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
with Zelecurmin

1035
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,040
analyzing that proposition

1036
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
trying to figure out

1037
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
whether it was practical

1038
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
and if so

1039
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
how building expenses

1040
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
should be shared

1041
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
between the two groups and so forth

1042
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
so I spent quite a lot of time

1043
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
in those kinds of deliberations

1044
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
at that time too

1045
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
and eventually we came up

1046
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
with a recommendation

1047
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,040
to line us calling in the board.

1048
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,040
One of

1049
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
calling

1050
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,040
some calling

1051
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,040
are just

1052
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,040
about

1053
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
taking away

1054
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
than the Golden

1055
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,040
years of health

1056
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,040
equipment

1057
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,040
to collect

1058
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,040
and martial

1059
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,040
overseas

1060
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
tremendous talent

1061
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
of scientific

1062
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,040
resources

1063
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
of the graduate students

1064
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,040
or classmates

1065
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,040
and I'm

1066
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
wondering if you

1067
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
have shared this

1068
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,040
in one sort of

1069
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,040
academic going on

1070
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,040
that over the course of the month

1071
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,040
of the year

1072
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
with the release

1073
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
of

1074
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
quite talent

1075
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
and

1076
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,040
make it a visit

1077
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
for the future.

1078
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Well

1079
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
I think

1080
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,040
our Robinson is a terrific

1081
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,040
scientist

1082
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
and art

1083
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
of course was working

1084
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
very close with one

1085
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,040
as calling

1086
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
at the University of California San Diego

1087
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,040
and then came up

1088
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,040
to run his lab

1089
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,040
and collaborate

1090
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040
with research

1091
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
and Stanford

1092
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
and there's no question

1093
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
that Dr Robinson

1094
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,040
was an extraordinarily capable scientist

1095
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
and with

1096
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
calling

1097
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,040
developed lots of very interesting ideas.

1098
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
So

1099
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
that was one

1100
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,040
person

1101
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
that he worked with

1102
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
over that period of time

1103
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,040
that I had

1104
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,040
a lot of respect for

1105
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
and I think

1106
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
a lot of respect for

1107
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,040
at least until

1108
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,040
there was

1109
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,040
big schism

1110
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,040
that developed between them

1111
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,040
which was very painful

1112
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
to watch,

1113
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,040
especially

1114
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
at that time

1115
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,040
I was not really

1116
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
privy

1117
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
to a lot of the

1118
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
major administrative decisions

1119
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
that the Institute

1120
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
was a little unclear

1121
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
as to why

1122
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
it was very difficult

1123
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
and uncomfortable

1124
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,040
time

1125
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
for everyone I think

1126
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
at the Institute

1127
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
excuse me.

1128
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Bill A. Berg

1129
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,040
and Bill A. Berg

1130
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
physicist

1131
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,040
was also

1132
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
very

1133
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,040
extraordinarily talented

1134
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,040
individual

1135
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
with developing

1136
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,040
the

1137
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,040
mass spectrometer

1138
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,040
for

1139
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
metabolite profiling.

1140
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Emil Zuckerkondel

1141
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,040
who had developed

1142
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
the idea of

1143
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
chemical paleogenetics

1144
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,040
or molecular evolution

1145
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,040
with falling earlier

1146
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,040
in the 1960s

1147
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,040
was an

1148
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,040
extraordinarily bright

1149
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,040
and capable scientist.

1150
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
He was also

1151
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
the founding editor

1152
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040
of the Journal of Molecular

1153
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,040
Evolution

1154
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
and

1155
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
was

1156
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
one of those

1157
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
rare individuals

1158
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
who's capable of

1159
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
sustaining simultaneously

1160
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
many complex thoughts

1161
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
and I saw this

1162
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,040
in action many times

1163
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I have tremendous

1164
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
respect and admiration

1165
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
for in those of

1166
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,040
these

1167
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,040
the evidence

1168
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,040
and some of

1169
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,040
the scientific

1170
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,040
and theorists.

1171
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
The

1172
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,040
were people

1173
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,040
extraordinarily

1174
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
high caliber

1175
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
that were involved

1176
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
and of course

1177
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,040
the collaborations

1178
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
as well

1179
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,040
and some of Paul's collaborators

1180
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,040
were visiting a institute from time to time.

1181
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
There were a few

1182
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,040
problems

1183
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
in that

1184
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,040
since the Institute

1185
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
did not have

1186
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
stable financial resources

1187
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:30,120
dominant. It was difficult to attract high caliber scientists. The war high

1188
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:35,120
caliber scientists who were employed at the Institute John Levitt, Jim Fleming,

1189
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,640
Greg Spicer, there were a number of people that were very, very good, you and

1190
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,600
Cameron as a medical director, but it was difficult because not much could be

1191
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:52,920
offered to people other than at-will contract, which was the way that the most

1192
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:59,200
contract, most employment is handled in California, unless you have an employment

1193
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:06,760
contract and it was imprudent to offer employment contracts to people. So initially

1194
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,640
it was kind of an implied at-will employment arrangement with people and then later

1195
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,800
in the early 1990s it became very explicit at-will employment relationship with

1196
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,400
employees. But nevertheless there were people who were attracted to the Institute

1197
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,000
because of Linus Pong because of it is interesting vitamin C, Dr. Connie Chao and

1198
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,560
others who did a lot of really terrific work, Wolcott.com, just to mention a few,

1199
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,000
but there were a number of really excellent people there, physicians and scientists who

1200
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,600
did a lot of very good work over the years. And in those days it was also very difficult

1201
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:49,640
to get, expect, and get funding from the National Institutes of Health or the National

1202
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,040
Cancer Institute for the kind of work that Pauling was especially interested in, which

1203
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:02,320
had to do with vitamin C and cancer. So I'm sure you're aware of his difficulty in getting

1204
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,960
grants to carry out this kind of research with the very promising clinical work that

1205
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Cameron had been doing in Scotland, Pauling and Cameron went to the NCI with that work repeatedly

1206
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,800
and they suggested that he apply for funds to do animal work and so-called work and he applied

1207
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,880
for those funds and then was turned down repeatedly over seven or eight consecutive years.

1208
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,600
So the money that was supported that kind of work at the Institute was sought from the

1209
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,280
public through this direct mail solicitation campaign and that was the money that was available

1210
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:42,480
to pay the researchers who were doing that work.

1211
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:54,920
Pauling is also famously being a critical lecturer. I wonder if you could comment on that

1212
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:00,280
your experience in being in the lecture and is this only in that regard?

1213
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:09,160
Yes, I didn't see him lecture very often. I saw him give lectures at Stanford University

1214
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,480
and of course he would give the famous vitamin C lecture where he would stand on stage and

1215
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,000
pull from his, he typically wore a three-piece suit when he was giving a lecture, a dark suit

1216
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,920
sometimes he would wear his beret and he would invariably begin his lectures on a vitamin

1217
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,080
C by pulling out a vial, a test tube and holding it up with his fingers with a very small amount

1218
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,840
of a white powder at the bottom that was barely detectable from the audience perspective

1219
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,120
and you would say this represents the RDA for vitamin C, this is the amount of vitamin C that

1220
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,880
the Food Nutrition Board believes that people should get every day and he would follow that

1221
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:59,080
by pulling out a large test tube with 13 grams of vitamin C in it and you could obviously

1222
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,240
see all this white powder in the vial from across the auditorium and he would say this is the

1223
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,480
amount of vitamin C that a goat synthesizes on average every day. I think goats know more about

1224
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:15,080
nutrition than the Food Nutrition Board and of course that always got a big round of applause

1225
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:23,560
and chuckles from the audience. One lecture I saw him give which really stood out in my mind

1226
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:32,120
was a lecture departmental lecture to biostatistics at Stanford and that department was

1227
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:38,040
chaired by Byron Brown who was a leading biostatistician and the Stanford Department of Biostatistics

1228
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,720
is world-renowned. They've been world-renowned for many decades and Byron Brown was the father of

1229
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:52,360
classmate of mine from Stanford so I knew him and he had become aware of Pauling's work with

1230
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:59,000
Abram Hoffer on a regimen provided adjunctively to cancer patients since included not only

1231
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,640
vitamin C but also B vitamins, vitamin E, zinc and some other things and Pauling and Hoffer

1232
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,840
had published two papers on this regimen and Pauling believed that it was even more effective than

1233
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:18,120
the soul use of vitamin C which was given either intravenously or orally sometimes both by

1234
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:24,760
Ew and Cameron and Scotland and they had and Pauling had developed a statistical analysis of this

1235
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,120
data based on work done by an old friend of his from UC Berkeley by the name of Harden Jones

1236
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,520
and Pauling believed that this statistical analysis was better than the standard

1237
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:43,160
Kaplan Meyer mortality analysis because by using Harden Jones analysis you could actually

1238
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:52,600
resolve subcohorts that had similar death rates and you might be able to learn more about these

1239
00:58:52,600 --> 00:59:01,080
subcohorts with similar death rates so he thought that this was was a better way to analyze mortality

1240
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:08,280
data from from clinical studies and he published also I think was Ellicurman and perhaps it was

1241
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:14,520
PNAs on and this Harden Jones analysis of mortality data and he was invited by Byron Brown to give

1242
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:20,600
a lecture to the biostatisticians at Stanford on this Harden Jones mortality data and of course

1243
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:27,160
at the time everybody was using Kaplan Meyer which is the standard step staircase type curve

1244
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:33,960
that you see published in papers and I went with Pauling and Herman to that lecture which was

1245
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:42,200
in a large conference room over at Stanford and it was astonishing how little criticism he got

1246
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,520
from this analysis I think he was prepared to be well he was never really defensive about anything

1247
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:54,680
because he was very sure was on intelligence and his own analysis but no one had any serious

1248
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:01,000
criticisms of his analysis and people were saying that while perhaps we should we should look at this

1249
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,840
more carefully and perhaps this does offer a better alternative to Kaplan Meyer analysis and some

1250
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,200
circumstances it was quite extraordinary quite extraordinary to see some of the world's leading

1251
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:19,240
biostatisticians react that way to something that was fairly novel and something that was certainly

1252
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:27,000
not standardly employed in this kind of analysis and it was quite interesting to see him present that

1253
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:35,160
analysis. I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit more about Pauling of the mentor as well

1254
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:44,200
as your software and the others you saw. He was very encouraging and as I said he was not a

1255
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:52,280
loop so it was very easy person to speak with. I think at the time that I got to know him of course

1256
01:00:52,280 --> 01:01:00,680
he was in his 80s and at that time he was considered kind of an icon in science and everyone was

1257
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:07,160
extraordinarily respectful to one as Pauling. No one at the Institute called him by his first name

1258
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,880
for instance it was always professor Pauling or Dr. Pauling even Dorothy Monroe the secretary

1259
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:18,200
and assistant called him Dr. Pauling and typically he's eloquent I'm going to call him professor Pauling

1260
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,160
Amy Ozzercocondo typically called him Dr. Pauling as to Rick Hicks and so I think that was

1261
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:36,440
a measure of respect that all the people at the Institute had for him. He was also very interested in

1262
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:47,640
people in a personal basis as well and I remember when he had decided not to drive so much himself

1263
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,160
anymore from his apartment on Stanford campus to the Institute which was just a mile or two away

1264
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,160
people would volunteer to drive him from his apartment to the Institute and then take them back

1265
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,400
to his apartment at the end of the day and I did that quite often because I enjoyed talking with him

1266
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,920
and I also enjoyed to have an uninterrupted period with him where he was free from telephone calls

1267
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,200
or appointments and other distractions because there were a lot of demands on his time throughout his

1268
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,440
career I imagine and at the Institute there were always people calling wanting to interview him

1269
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:27,000
wanting him to get lectures and so forth and wanting to visit him so was rare to have an occasion to actually

1270
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:33,720
talk with him one on one with no distractions and he would occasionally ask me about my long-term

1271
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,440
aspirations and make suggestions and he would often tell me stories he loved to tell stories about things

1272
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,840
that had happened to him that were based on work that we were doing at the Institute or that

1273
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:52,360
might have been stimulated by a comment I would make to him and I remember one time this is a

1274
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:59,080
little off topic because doesn't do a mentorship but I think it gives you some insight into his sense of humor

1275
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:07,160
during one of these trips where I was taking him to the Institute and he told me that he had been

1276
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:14,200
over at the Stanford Library to look at an old issue of nature or science from close to the early

1277
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:21,320
part of the 20th century close to the turn of the century and this was when David Star Jordan

1278
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,480
was present in the Stanford University of Leeland Stanford was chairman of the board.

1279
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,240
David Star Jordan was an ornphologist excuse me itch theologist who had written books on

1280
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:38,360
academic books on fish and he was present in the university at that time as well as being a scholar

1281
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,800
and Pauling had been looking through an old issue of nature and for a specific article but this

1282
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,840
other story caught his eye and it had to do with a controversy that had developed at Stanford

1283
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:55,480
between David Star Jordan and Leeland Stanford and Leeland Stanford apparently had become

1284
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:01,480
unhappy with David Star Jordan because during trustees meetings Jordan did not refer to the

1285
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,440
trustees by name and Stanford thought that this was not civil and perhaps even borderline

1286
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:15,480
rude not to refer to them by name and he had implored Jordan to learn the names of the trustees

1287
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:22,200
and in subsequent meetings to refer to them by name and Jordan's retort apparently to Stanford

1288
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,080
was well I'm afraid if I enforce to memorize the name of a trustee I'll forget the name of a fish

1289
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:32,680
and Pauling thought that was hilarious and it gives you an idea of what he valued

1290
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,080
because I think he was definitely on the side of Jordan in that argument

1291
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,400
I just think do you recall any other stories from the drive time?

1292
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,920
Oh there were lots of other stories one time wasn't during a drive but it was when

1293
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,520
I was negotiating in contract with Unilever and Elizabeth Orden who had

1294
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,920
decided to develop a line of cosmetics that included some antioxidants and wanted to

1295
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,040
get the Institute involved in this not in a research and development capacity but they wanted to

1296
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,800
support some research at the Institute and provide us with a lot of money and I've been talking

1297
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,720
many times with Linus Pong about this prospect and went into talk with him in his office about it and he

1298
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:25,800
said oh he remembered one time that he and A.V. Helen had gone to visit Lord Leaver in England

1299
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:34,520
and had brought along a bottle of Scotch whisky as a present and it was in their bag and they got

1300
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:41,480
to Lord Leaver's castle or home and they were met by servants who immediately took their bags

1301
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,680
and they were ushered in to see Lord Leaver and Pauling in his wife were chatting with him

1302
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:51,640
and Pauling remembered that he had a gift so he wanted to excuse himself and go to his room

1303
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,000
and get the gift for Lord Leaver and went up to his room and the servants had already unpacked their

1304
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,200
bags put clothes in the drawers or hanging in the closet and they'd also taken out the bottle of

1305
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:11,000
whisky and uncapped it and had two jiggers there ready for Pauling and it's a wife because they

1306
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
believe that Pauling brought this long to serve himself so he thought it was very funny that he had to

1307
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:23,560
present Lord Leaver where the bottle of whisky that had already been opened but he explained to him

1308
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:31,240
why it had been open and one other story that I thought was quite indicative of Pauling's character

1309
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,640
was told to me by you and Cameron and Cameron of course had been collaborating very closely with

1310
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:44,680
Pauling and Pauling had decided to visit Cameron as home in Walk Woman's side

1311
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,680
on a trip that he was making to England and Cameron told me that he was a little bit ambivalent

1312
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,880
about this visit by the great man of science to his humble home in Scotland he was worried that

1313
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,400
it wouldn't be presentable enough so he and his wife made elaborate preparations to welcome

1314
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:10,280
Linus Pauling and his wife to their humble home in Scotland and the day that Pauling arrived

1315
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:15,880
Pauling arrived and within half an hour before Pauling had arrived the toilet stopped up

1316
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,920
and Cameron hadn't had time to do anything about it before the arrival of Linus Pauling and his wife

1317
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,480
so Pauling and his wife arrived and they came in and pleasant trees were exchanged and Cameron showed

1318
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,560
them around the home in the view and so forth and Pauling asked to use the bathroom and Cameron said

1319
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:41,480
which I'm very, very sorry this character is quite but there seems to be a problem with the toilet

1320
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,040
and Pauling so what's the problem and Cameron explained in the toilet had just gotten stopped up

1321
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,480
and he hadn't had time to do anything and Pauling so well it's going to fix it so Cameron was

1322
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:57,320
a bit of gas but said okay so the two of them went into the bathroom and and Pauling cut down

1323
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:02,920
with a ranch and Cameron had the plumbers helper and Pauling had a ranch and he was lying on the floor

1324
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:10,360
with working on the plumbing fixing Cameron's toilet so Cameron realized that he didn't really

1325
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,480
need to be too careful about what he said or how Pauling was treated after that because he recognized

1326
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,400
that Pauling was was not an aloof cerebral sort of person he didn't get his hands dirty so I

1327
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:32,040
just speak so he mentioned that one year maybe the first experience of Pauling he had was

1328
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,160
of him doing it after they would be seeing Pauling fix now why didn't he think he could

1329
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:42,760
reflect a little bit more on what he saw it and then tend to just be stuck with him in the floor

1330
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:48,280
of the toilet and of course he hadn't used well of course I myself was very much opposed to the

1331
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,800
Vietnam War my brother was killed there as a fighter pilot in 1970 which really almost interfere

1332
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,120
with me resuming my studies at Stanford because it was emotionally very difficult time

1333
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:05,000
and I had never understood the logic of the war I didn't buy that domino theory that the

1334
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,760
administration time was promoting with respect to we need to stop communism Vietnam because then

1335
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:17,320
all all the countries in South East Asia will become communist in Indonesia and Japan might be

1336
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,120
attacked and so forth I didn't buy that explanation and it seemed to me that the war had been

1337
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:28,600
going on for a very long time and was resulting in a lot of misery and I couldn't see how it was

1338
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:35,880
constructive I couldn't see a good outcome so I I think had sentiments that were very similar to

1339
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,960
those espoused by Linus Pauling at the time and Pauling of course as I learned had been an

1340
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,760
old hand in political activism originally stimulated by his concern about proliferation of nuclear

1341
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:54,920
weapons and medical concerns about the effect of widespread fallout from atomic bomb testing

1342
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:01,240
in the atmosphere so that that really resonated very strongly with me there were some people at the

1343
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:07,560
institute who were even further left and I would consider myself in some ways conservative and many

1344
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,200
ways liberal as well but there were some people from the institute who were I would say probably

1345
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:19,000
extreme leftist and I remember in particular after one of Pauling's talks it's Stanford that was

1346
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:27,080
peace-related there was quite a lot of unhappiness among some people because Pauling had made the

1347
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:33,960
statement during this talk that he believed that the retention of some nuclear weapons by both

1348
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:42,680
the Soviet Union and the United States and the so-called mutually assured destruction principle

1349
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:52,760
had actually resulted perhaps in deterrent from having a nuclear war configuration so they were

1350
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,680
they were surprised to hear him say that because I think some people had hoped that he would

1351
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,520
espouse the opinion that we should destroy all weapons you know laterally and so forth but

1352
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,040
that's not what he said in his lecture he said that he believed that having some of these weapons

1353
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,480
by opposing forces would have probably resulted in the satisfactory stalemate because either side

1354
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:20,040
was inhibited from using them knowing what would result from that first use of an atomic weapon

1355
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:28,120
right and that was uh and I think in that community involved for years early on he didn't sit

1356
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:36,200
I think he knows that he's involved yeah and I heard him say that several times so he definitely was not

1357
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:44,200
I would say he wasn't a pacifist because he he said many times the World War II was well justified

1358
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:52,120
and he as you know worked closely with a military to develop armaments and instruments that

1359
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:57,800
helped the Allied effort during World War II he was certainly opposed to Hitler and Naziism and

1360
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,360
I always saw him as a great patriot and it never occurred to me that

1361
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:12,040
great patriotism and opposition to the Vietnam War or opposition to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was somehow

1362
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,480
couldn't be reconciled and some people

1363
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,960
didn't seem to be to mean mutual exclusive characteristics

1364
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,720
we're calling for something that came up around the student mail

1365
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,400
we talked about that with people and casual conversations with his colleagues or with his primarily

1366
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:36,280
weren't they disappointed? Pauling was not someone who engaged often in small talk

1367
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,520
so even in the many discussions that I had with him he wasn't someone who liked to talk about

1368
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:51,400
pop culture or movies or music or literature or anything of that nature he loved to talk about

1369
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:56,840
science and especially about things that he was interested in and he loved to tell stories and

1370
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,000
most of the stories were related to things that interested him from a scientific basis

1371
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:12,520
so I don't recall ever talking with him specifically about any political activities and

1372
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,920
unfortunately I never thought to ask him more closely about some of his political activities

1373
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,880
because there were always other things to talk about and I didn't really query him much about

1374
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,960
his personal history when I knew him we're always talking about current things or things that

1375
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:33,560
were going to be doing in the future and not so much retrospective issues except when he would tell

1376
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:39,720
me stories based on a current stimulating conversation that we might be having but no he didn't

1377
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:45,560
generally talk about political issues with the staff it was mainly related to administrative issues

1378
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:55,160
and scientific issues well what was he like in the larger social settings well in

1379
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:02,440
largest social settings he was often the the person that people gravitated to he had a real

1380
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:10,840
charismatic personality kind of a magnetic personality he he always had a big smile he was very engaging

1381
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:17,960
very warmly greeted people in the social setting was physical shook hands put his arm around

1382
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:24,120
people so he was he was very engaging and people responded to that and that's why

1383
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:31,640
so many people loved him over the years and when he died in 1994 the institute collected hundreds

1384
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:37,640
and hundreds of cards from people that didn't know lunch point personally but had been deeply

1385
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:44,200
affected by his death and were were grieving and sharing their grief with us at the time and

1386
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,760
everyone at the institute felt the same way as well I mean it was a really when he died in 1994 it

1387
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:55,720
was a very emotional moment for all of us because he just he had a way of generating a lot of

1388
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:01,640
positive emotion about him and a lot of people loved him and respected him for different reasons but

1389
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:10,200
he was a very jovial person he as I said he treated everyone fairly and equally I remember one time

1390
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,960
when I was in the back parking lot of the institute Pauling was leaving

1391
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,760
the back door and the janitor was arriving so it was after hours it was maybe five thirty or six

1392
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,960
in the afternoon and the janitor was quite away from the door I'd say maybe a hundred feet from

1393
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,960
the door because janitor tended to park at the far end of the parking lot and Pauling stood there

1394
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:42,120
holding the door open for probably three or four minutes while the janitor navigated this distance

1395
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,000
and came into the building and then Pauling greeted him and then left the door and he was also

1396
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,960
holding a box because he often used a box to ferry books and papers back and forth from the

1397
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:57,480
institute to his apartment or ranch so he had something that in his arm as well instead they're

1398
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:05,720
holding the door for the janitor and I think that was kind of symbolic in a way of the way he treated

1399
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:17,400
people he was just very fair to everyone sometimes I think his excitement about scientific ideas that

1400
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:25,400
he would generate an association with particular people caused him perhaps to overlook what might

1401
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:32,200
some other people might consider problematic issues in personalities and I think that this

1402
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,960
happened to him at least twice in his later years at the institute and both times it resulted in

1403
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:47,480
personal clashes very unemicable departures of personal from the institute and litigation which was

1404
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:53,880
very difficult expensive and painful for everyone involved but I think he was so excited by

1405
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,920
scientific talent that he tended to overlook some personality characteristics from time to time

1406
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:05,880
but as I said it was a very warm engaging person I would go to birthday celebrations

1407
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:13,080
which occurred I think every five years typically at hotel in San Francisco and there were other

1408
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:22,360
occasions at which visitors were honored or the humanitarian award was given out or other awards

1409
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:31,880
were given out or Pauling was an intense award and he was always very very charming and people were

1410
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:42,120
very happy to see him and he always had a big smile and greeting for everyone well the birthday

1411
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:49,320
celebrations were terrific the last one I remember was at Stanford Courthode Hotel in San Francisco

1412
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:55,800
the mistress of ceremonies was Rita Moreno and I believe she was approached by Rick Hicks

1413
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:05,480
to host that party because she had gotten an Emmy an OB atoni and an Academy Award so

1414
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:11,000
Rick thought it was appropriate that someone who had been so honored in so many of the performing

1415
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,720
fields was hosting an event for someone who had been so honored in so many medical and scientific

1416
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,920
and social field like Lyme's Pauling and she was a real firecracker and I think Lyme's Pauling

1417
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:29,480
really enjoyed listening to her talk and he had a lot of his old friends there and it was it was always

1418
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:36,840
he always really enjoyed interacting with old colleagues we also had a 20th anniversary celebration

1419
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,600
of the Lyme's Pauling Institute in 1993 at the Rings Doorhouse which was a Victorian house that had been

1420
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:49,720
renovated in the salt marsh area of Mountain View California adjacent to Palo Alto and that was

1421
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:55,800
an opportunity to put on display a lot of Pauling's awards medals, honorary degrees and also invite

1422
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:03,160
supporters of the Institute Institute staff and friends and some of Pauling's colleagues and

1423
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,720
friends who were still in the Bay Area to come and see him and as it turned out it was probably

1424
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,200
the last time that some of these people had an opportunity to meet him to see him again.

1425
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,000
Owen Chamberlain was there hard in McConnell from Stanford chemistry department who had been

1426
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,960
a long friend of Pauling's and I think instrumental in bringing Pauling to Stanford back in 1969

1427
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,880
was there byron Brown from biostatistics was there and there were a number of people that Pauling

1428
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:33,400
had liked and associated with over the years that were there and it provided him an opportunity to

1429
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:40,040
see them and greet them. He always had a lot of energy to meet people as well and

1430
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,600
he had a very interesting way of speaking that was very characteristic and a very characteristic way

1431
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:53,560
of moving as well both of which were captured quite realistically by John Aston when he performed

1432
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,880
the part of Linus Pauling in the nature of the Marital Bond which was a play put on in association

1433
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,480
between the Linus Pauling exhibition years ago.

1434
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:26,120
Well he spent quite a lot of time of course with Rick Hicks and he meals out of the condol and I think

1435
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:33,560
Rick was, Rick really went out of his way to try to take care of Linus Pauling as well as

1436
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:39,560
especially after he had a hell and died. I really looked after his welfare and was interested in

1437
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,280
his personal health as well and I think he even tried to get Linus Pauling to exercise which is

1438
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:51,560
something that Pauling refused to do and he talked quite often when they meals with the condol mainly

1439
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,280
about administrative issues. So with Rick Hicks and he meals out of the condol there was a lot of

1440
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:04,040
talk about administrative issues and these kinds of conversations went on for a decade or longer.

1441
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:11,320
He saw quite a lot of hardened McConnell who was someone he could talk about chemistry with and

1442
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:17,960
Henry Talbe as well as Stanford. And Zoa Kerman was another person that was a colleague

1443
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:26,520
and an employee of the Institute but someone that Pauling could talk in a very meaningful detailed way in depth about

1444
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:33,800
theoretical chemistry and structural chemistry and physics. So Perman and Pauling co-authored quite a few

1445
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:41,720
papers during this period in 1970s through the 1980s and up through the 1990s and I think Pauling relied on him to

1446
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:50,120
do a lot of the sort of the heavy work in many of those papers. So he spent a lot of time with

1447
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:57,240
Zoa Kerman as well and there were a lot of people that visited him who he'd known throughout his life

1448
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:06,360
but he didn't really seem to have what I would call a strong social life. Of course

1449
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:12,440
if he was entertaining people at his home in Porto, Vali or at his apartment in Stanford

1450
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:18,760
I wouldn't necessarily have known about that. I mean I went to his home in Porto, Vali, a number of times.

1451
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:25,240
He and his wife used to host Christmas parties there and one of the last Christmas parties I went

1452
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:35,480
to there I think was probably 1979. Either Helen died in 1980 or 1981. 81. So I believe that

1453
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:42,600
this was probably about 1979 and I remember thinking about the eggnog that Pauling made which was really

1454
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:51,880
extraordinarily good. He wasn't a chef but having a Nobel Prize winning chemist, Nobel Prize winning

1455
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:59,320
chemist make the eggnog and spike it with vicar was pretty extraordinary. It was a really terrific treat

1456
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:07,080
and when he was with his wife was also very affectionate and I think people picked up on that

1457
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:15,160
affection and responded to that as well. After his wife died of course there was no one for him to

1458
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:21,320
be that affectionate with so he was a bit different in in social situation because it didn't really

1459
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:34,280
have someone to to be affectionate with in those circumstances. She was a really diminutive person.

1460
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:41,960
She was short. She was very well spoken, very articulate and I enjoyed speaking with her when I

1461
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:47,720
talked to her several times. She and I did not talk about science so much as we talked about other

1462
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:56,280
issues and she as I found out later was particularly fond of their association with some of the

1463
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,480
celebrities and in Los Angeles and Hollywood during the era in which Pauling was trying to educate

1464
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:09,960
them about radioactive isotopes and nuclear weapons and so forth and engaged in peace activities as

1465
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:17,160
well and we talked I think about how I talked about those things sometimes but typically she was

1466
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,960
very close to her husband physically whenever they were in a social environment and he always liked

1467
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:28,680
to steer the conversation to science so the conversation typically would end up being about science

1468
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:33,480
and not so much about so many other activities. One of the things about Pauling

1469
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:45,480
that I enjoyed was when I found out that he enjoyed reading mystery novels I also was a big fan of

1470
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:51,800
Sherlock Holmes and not so much I get the Christie but particularly Rex Stout and I asked him if he had

1471
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,400
read all of Sherlock Holmes and Rex Stout and of course he had so there wasn't anything I could loan him

1472
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,200
but there were other books that I was reading and he was not familiar with. One was called the

1473
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,240
Red Right Hand by Joel Townsley Rogers which I think was written in 1939 or 1940 and it's a real

1474
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:15,720
hard-boiled, great detective story and I loan that to him and he really he loved that book very much

1475
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:21,480
and he consequently loaned me books I would loan him books and he would he would loan me mystery books

1476
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:28,120
as well that he had finished reading it was very interesting then and one time he he broke from

1477
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:34,120
that orthodoxy and loaning the mystery novels and loaned me a book called Good Night Ava by Richard

1478
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:41,400
Bistle and this was a 1950s pulp paperback with a painted cover and he said I think you'll

1479
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,880
enjoy this and I got the book and I read it and it reminded me a little bit of verse can

1480
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:56,600
called well even Mark Twain maybe and the cover of the book showed kind of a disultry group sitting

1481
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,760
on a on a porch of a kind of a ramshackle cabin probably in the banks of the Mississippi River

1482
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,800
and there were a couple of guys lounging around look like near duels and there was a woman's

1483
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:15,320
trimming guitar in not much on and she had her foot up on a pickle barrel or something

1484
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,640
and I thought it was amusing that he's loaned me this book and it was actually an amusing

1485
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,840
entertaining read as well and I gave it back to him and when he when I gave it back to him his eyes

1486
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:31,640
kind of sparkle a bit and he said did you notice anything particularly funny about the book

1487
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,640
and I said yes and both of us burst out laughing he had taken a photograph of this

1488
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:45,880
wife and cut out her face and pasted it over the face of the woman playing guitar on the cover

1489
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:52,360
of the book and I thought that was very funny very appropriate since the the book had Eva in the

1490
01:26:52,360 --> 01:27:01,400
title as well you have that book I'm sure you do yeah and he had he had a terrific sense of humor

1491
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:07,320
zeal a term and likes to tell the story of the time that he was standing at the urinal

1492
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:12,760
in the men's room at the line is pines to do science medicine and line is pines came in and

1493
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:22,120
stood next to him and looked over and said ah we meet his peers so he was not prudish

1494
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:29,400
and of course Ken Hedberg has a very famous story of when Ken was a graduate student

1495
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:36,520
Caltech and was looking through one of those little plastic viewfinders the woman oh natural

1496
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:42,840
and the stream standing on a rock or a boulder I mean holding this viewfinder up to the light

1497
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:50,680
and he heard polling footsteps outside his office and thought oh and polling came in and of course

1498
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,800
wanted to see what the viewfinder picture was and he held the viewfinder up to the light and said ah

1499
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:02,120
basalt and he did identify the rock that she was standing on so he had a great sense of humor

1500
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,840
and it would definitely was not prudish

1501
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:11,480
just backtrack and briefly you mentioned that all he's talking about the connections that they

1502
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:17,800
had with some of the Hollywood types you call any individual who is particularly fun about

1503
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,840
the rhythm of that no I don't but I remember there were a number of people who came to the

1504
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:32,360
Institute and also to some of polling birthday events and other events such as Eddie Albert remember

1505
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:40,920
giving a tour to Eddie Albert and son Eddie Albert Jr. one time at the Institute and Carl Sagan came

1506
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:49,320
by one time for an event and there were a number of other number of other people who escaped me

1507
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:56,920
right now who came through the Institute and one reason or another but those who were I believe

1508
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:03,400
after Avalan and died so those were people who had continued to have some title in his poem

1509
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,600
or the one in his poem Institute but I don't recollect talking with her about specific people

1510
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:14,200
following by all accounts at a very difficult time dealing with their own death

1511
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:22,040
you have memories of that time dating how that ended so well as every call he was gone quite a lot

1512
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:29,240
after her death I think he took a trip to Oregon and visited some of his old boyhood

1513
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:36,920
haunts his home maybe the family cemetery maybe went to condon came here to Oregon State University

1514
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:45,080
he was perhaps didn't exhibit the same sort of levity that that I was accustomed to seeing

1515
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:52,840
in him in other words he was spontaneously happy in the late 1970s when I saw him he always seemed to be

1516
01:29:52,840 --> 01:30:01,960
very happy and very carefree I think there was a more somber demeanor that he exhibited after

1517
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:11,320
her death and a lot of the sort of levity seemed to evaporate from his countenance at that time

1518
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:20,040
now that slowly returned over the course of the 1980s and I'd say by the mid to late 1980s he seemed

1519
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:24,360
to be pretty much his old self in terms of the good sense of humor but there was a period there

1520
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:40,360
when he didn't seem to be very happy yeah that's why
