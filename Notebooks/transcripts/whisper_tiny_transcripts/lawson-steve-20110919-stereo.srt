1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
that are replaceable.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, we're done.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So we will have you check the volume level and we're okay.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll start like the device time.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you do yourself.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is Stephen Lawson.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's September 19, 2011.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we are in a room in the Valley Library

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
on campus of Oregon State University.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So this is the second of our interviews that is basically doing when it's falling

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in this personal characteristics.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And we want to provide different things for our last one.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to start to say by talking about the following family.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the interaction that you have with following children.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You'd like to start with years.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Peter Pauling.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I believe I met Peter probably in the late 1970s or early 1980s

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
for the first time when he was visiting his father or his parents in California

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
from England.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Very interesting fellow.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He was in a way the black sheep of the family in terms of his personal habits.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He seemed to drink quite a lot and was a smoker.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I think that some of those habits had some health consequences for him late in life.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But he was a very personal, very direct person with a good sense of humor.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I really enjoyed my interactions with him.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In the early 1990s, I received a box addressed to me

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
at the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, California,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
with no return address and no letter inside.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the box held what appeared to be Linus Polynes chemistry, no bell prize, metal.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And I was very perplexed by this.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't know why it would be sent to me.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who sent it?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Except that the postmark was from Europe.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I knew that it originated in Europe.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I had no understanding of who sent it or why.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And whether or not the metal was authentic.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I called up Henry Talbeys and Nobel Prize winner in chemistry at Stanford.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He was a good friend of Linus Polynes and he and I compared the metals.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And the metal that I had got in the mail seemed to be authentic.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Except for the fact that it seemed to be an alloy,

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
rather than solid gold or gold plated, whatever the actual metal is.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I put it aside in my office and about a week and a half or two weeks later

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I received the second package from Europe.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Again, no return address, no correspondence.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This time there was the Nobel Peace Prize metal inside the box.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So now I was really stumped.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And very curious as to why these were being sent to me and who had sent them.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And about a week or two after that second box had arrived,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I received a phone call from Peter who was an England at the time.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And he asked me early on in the conversation.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If I'd received anything unusual in the mail recently.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I said, well yes, Peter, I have.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I received two replicas of your father's Nobel prizes.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And he said, oh good, I'm glad you got those.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He very graciously had gone to the academies and had duplicate metal struck

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
in an alloy for family members and for the Linus Poly Institute of Science in medicine.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Which I thought was very nice of him.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I think he had that done.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, it was around the time of his father's death.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't recall if it was before or after, but it was right around that era when he did that.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you ever have a chance to talk about his scientific research?

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well then.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I never really had a chance to talk to Peter about a scientific work or his work in on chemical structure.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We did talk occasionally about the vitamin C and cancer work that Pauling was doing in collaboration with you in Cameron and Scotland.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And Peter was very interested in that work of course.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Although I don't know that he actually communicated much with you in Cameron,

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and they weren't the same island there off Europe.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Linda Pauling, I've known for quite a long time.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think I met her either a party at her parents' house in Portola Valley,

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
or perhaps at the Linus Poly Institute of Science in Medicine and Memorial Park.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She's a very nice person.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like I said, I've known her for a very long time, and I knew her husband.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think perhaps before I met her, because her husband would visit the Linus Poly Institute in Palo Alto occasionally to talk with his father in law,

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Linus Pauling, because they had jointly authored papers in theoretical physics and chemistry.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And Barclay was a very interesting person, and I remember asking him to explain one of the papers to me that he co-author with Linus Pauling, and he said he was stumped by it.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which is very amusing.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I got to know Linda a little bit better when the Linus Poly exhibition was being planned,

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
because we both served on the Advisory Committee.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we were meeting together with family members and other people from the scientific community,

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and Soka Gakai, quite often, to both plan the Linus Poly exhibition and at the different venues at which it can be.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I did get to know her pretty well, and I remember when we moved files from the Linus Poly Institute of Science in Medicine here to Oregon State University,

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
many of the files from Pauling's office were moved to Weniger Hall before they were transferred to special collections.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I was looking through some of those files for one reason or another, and I came across a letter from Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize winner at Caltech,

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
two Linus Poly, a parently response to a letter that Pauling had sent to him earlier, because the earlier letter was referenced in the response from Feynman to Pauling.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And Feynman at that time had been diagnosed with an often fatal disease, and I think Linus Poly had written to him,

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
suggesting that high dose vitamin C may have some value.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And apparently in the earlier letter that Pauling sent to Feynman, he had enclosed some reprints of papers that he and Cameron had written on vitamin C and cancer,

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
explaining host resistance and stimulation of the immune system and so forth.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So Feynman had written back to Pauling, thanking him for providing all this information to him and mentioning that he was going to share this with his physician.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then I think in a separate paragraph, he started and I'm paraphrasing that he was had been thinking about Pauling's long career, very productive career, and all the major contributions that he had made the science and humanity.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And he closed by saying something quite clever and funny. He said, you know Linus, I'm thinking about all your achievements and the wonderful things you've done for society, but I think your greatest achievement, your greatest contribution has been your daughter, Linda.

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I thought that was quite funny.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you recall any conversations you had with him so that he'd been reflecting back on that kind of stuff about them and what would like to be in Pauling?

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Not really. I think when I was engaged with Crownland, Linda, or Peter, particularly.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We were either in social settings, which there were a lot of people involved, so it wasn't easy to have a protracted conversation, or they were meetings in which we had specific strategic goals and we talked about various businesses or relationships or so forth.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I never asked any questions about family history of any of the children actually, even though I had many opportunities, it just never occurred to me to delve into their personal relationships with their parents.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Maybe I felt it was a little improper for me to do so.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Crownland, I had known Crownland for quite a long time. He came by the Institute as did all the children from time to time, so I would see them, although I didn't communicate much with them.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Crownland became more active with the Institute as his father's illness progressed, and as we were struggling with future options for the Institute, and he was also the executive, I believe, of his father's will.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And some of the elements of that will affected the Linus Polynes, the two science medicine, so one thing that I discussed with Crownland in great detail, and we communicated about many times, both early and in writing, concerned royalties to some of Linus Polynes books.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because Pauling had written, for instance, how to move longer and feel better, as an employee of the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine, and he had directed that out all royalties and revenue from that book,

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:36,000
being given to the Linus Polynes Institute. And when it came time to tie up some loose ends, concerning the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine, I was interested in whether that same principle would apply to some of Pauling's other books.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In particular, vitamin C in the common cold or vitamin C in cancer, which, of course, again, was written as an employee of the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine.

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, Crownland, I discussed those issues several times, and he seemed to be very amenable to reason, which I thought was great.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And of course, you know Linus Jr. quite well, was there any new merrier thoughts to come to Linus?

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Linus Polynes Jr. I enjoy Linus Polynes Jr. very much, and of all the children I've worked most closely with him, and I think I probably know him best of all the children.

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I had seen him from time to time when he came to California to participate in trustees meetings, because I believe he's been on the Board of Trustees of the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Excuse me, probably since its inception, and periodic board meetings were held over the years, and I would see him, but I never really met him until the Institute was reorganized in the early 1990s.

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And there was a desire, I think, on the part of the Board, and on the part of Linus Polynes Jr.

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
to spare his father from some of the administrative responsibilities and tasks associated with running the Institute on a day-to-day basis,

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and let him concentrate on research, which really is what he wanted to do, and since time was becoming more precious, everyone felt that he should do what he wanted to do,

113
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
which was to focus on science.

114
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I talked with Linus Polynes Jr. after I was asked by the Board to become executive officer, and then later chief executive officer of the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine.

115
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And Linus Jr. became chairman of the Board of Trustees. He and I worked very closely together for several years, and communicated very often about financial personnel management issues at the Institute.

116
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In particular, there was the possibility that the former President Director of the Institute, I Meals Oopicondal,

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which started a new Institute called the Institute of Medical Molecular Sciences, and that we would subly space in the building at 440 page mill road to IMMS.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And that was a very complicated and somewhat controversial and divisive issue.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And Linus Polynes Jr. and Linus Polynes had asked me, along with a couple of other people, with the Linus Polynes Institute of Science and Medicine, to analyze this possibility.

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And report as to whether or not it would work practically, and if so, how we would manage that that sublease and sharing of the physical space in the building.

121
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I worked very closely with Linus Polynes Jr. during that period.

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And then of course, in trying to stabilize the finances of the Institute, which were always teetering in those days,

123
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and worked with him closely on public relations and kind of marketing of the Institute, and later very closely on trying to identify options for the future of the Institute,

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,000
because with Linus Polynes demise and the problems that confronted us in Palo Alto, it was not certain that the Linus Polynes can carry on as a viable research organization.

125
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Or even if that was the ideal option for the future, excuse me.

126
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So we spent many hours and days analyzing and debating what the right future for the Institute might be,

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and eventually decided that keeping the orthomolecular medical mission as a lasting legacy to Linus Polynes work in orthomolecular medicine,

128
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
which is why the Institute was founded in the first place, would be the most appropriate future for the Institute.

129
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So Linus Polynes Jr. and I said about trying to identify as I said options for relocation.

130
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you mentioned Berkeley camera, when either other people were other people extended to have family or any other colleagues out there, would you have contact with me?

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes. Berkeley Kim's son, Berkeley Kim, Jr. I believe.

132
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm Colin Barkey.

133
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is a partner at Coolie Guide, Warden Palo Alto, and his wife was asked to become a trustee of the Linus Polynes Institute Science and Medicine back after the reorganization in the early 1990s.

134
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And we had quite a few ownerous legal issues to deal with at the time, and Barkey being part of that law firm that we hired to provide legal counsel and advice was very helpful to the Institute,

135
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and I talked with him many times at that time, and of course I saw him socially as well.

136
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't believe that I had much interaction with the other extended members of the family.

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
At about the time of Pauling's death, before he died, and after he died, there were of course many visits from extended families,

138
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Linus Polynes Jr. family, Linus family, and others.

139
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I met many of the grandchildren and children and so forth, but I can't say that I really had very meaningful conversations with any of them.

140
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You brought something up that I haven't thought to ask you about, but it makes perfect sense to it.

141
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And we guess you had it for you, in perspective, on the transcripts, on papers from a lot of the work at the old offices.

142
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

143
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, it was very interesting.

144
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I've always been in favor of transparency and access, and I thought that I've always thought that access to Pauling's papers and memorabilia should be encouraged for scholarship,

145
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and this is a lot to learn there, and I think the more people look into Pauling's career and activities, the more interesting and astonishing it becomes.

146
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's really a multifaceted project.

147
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Although it didn't have some concerns initially about when I learned that the intent of special collections, which I think is a good one, was to make Pauling's papers available online.

148
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It struck me as a really terrific project, especially the scientific papers, the research notebooks and so forth.

149
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I was concerned about the correspondence being scanned and made available online for a couple of reasons.

150
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
One, many people would write to Pauling with asking for advice on medical issues.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I had cancer, they had various disease, they had a friend or relative or colleague with disease, and they wanted to know how much vitamin C to take or what other therapies might appropriate to treat this particular disease.

152
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And sometimes they would include a donation.

153
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And typically the way these donations were processed, the photocopy of the check might be made and then stapled to some of the correspondence.

154
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I was concerned that there needed to be some judicious oversight in the way material was scanned and made available online because medical conditions, confidential information related to some of Pauling's correspondence.

155
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I didn't feel it should be released to the public.

156
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I was a little hesitant in making that material available to Oregon State University until special collections had come up with some sort of strategy to screen that material to protect those confidential issues of people that had written to Pauling over the years and never suspected that their letters or information would be publicly available on the internet.

157
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Partly because the internet hadn't existed when they wrote, and for other reasons, many of Pauling's files, his manuscripts, a lot of the scientific work, his correspondence were maintained by Dorothy and Monroe,

158
00:17:38,000 --> 00:18:07,000
the lines of Pauling's Institute of Science and Medicine. So of course those files were under our control for many years and then I worked with you and with Cliff Mead as well, who was director special collections at that time, to ensure that this material got transferred to special collections, although in many cases everything was moved in one project by moving company from the 440 page mill road address.

159
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In Palo Alto 2, the campus of Oregon State University and to simplify things, almost everything in that move went to our area in Weniger Hall and was stored in various rooms and then from time to time, those files and Pauling cabinets and materials were then transferred to special collections.

160
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I do have some memories of that, the green board that was in his office, he seldom erased from it. Sometimes he didn't virtually erase things because he would move too closely or a guest in the office would move too closely to the board and their code or shirt would inadvertently erase some of the writing on the board.

161
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I once asked Dorothy Monroe, maybe out of vanity, why my name wasn't on the board because I noticed that the names of some of the Institute employees were on the board and I was curious as to why my name wasn't and he said, well that's because he knows you so well, he doesn't need to have your name on the board as a mononymic device.

162
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Because sometimes for people that he didn't interact with regularly to associate the name on the board with the person when they came into his office was very useful to him.

163
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And the entrance to his office was adjacent to that green board, so it could very easily look from the person to the board and back and attach the name to the person that was standing in front of him if he was unclear as to who that person might be.

164
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think Cliff made the former director of special collections managed the technical aspects of moving the chalkboard.

165
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I know that there were issues about electrostatic dislodgment of chalk particles from the board if different types of acrylic were used and there was discussion about spraying the board with some sort of sealant that would forever fix the chalk to the board.

166
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But whatever technique was used and I believe a box was built around the board and it was very carefully they didn't have standing job because as far as I can tell there was no loss of information and when the board was moved from pawns office to special collections.

167
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Anything else?

168
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you getting away from calling a little bit here but something else?

169
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you reference that I want to ask you about it?

170
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Did you work with a window on it?

171
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's the idea.

172
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
All right.

173
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

174
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, I think that the origin for that exhibit probably goes back to...

175
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I know Desacca, Akeda, the head of SGI and Linus Pong had met in Converse prior to the establishment of the Linus Pong exhibition.

176
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So they were acquaintances and I think SGI or Akeda had expressed a desire to do something for Linus Pong or the Linus Pong Institute of Science and Medicine.

177
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And I think, although I'm not exactly clear on this, my recollection I haven't thought about this in a while and I haven't consulted any files but I think that the...

178
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think that desire was transformed into the exhibition partly due to conversations perhaps with Linus Pong Jr. in the early 1990s.

179
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And then of course, we thought it would be a way of educating the public about this extraordinary man and introducing school children to Linus Pong as a role model perhaps.

180
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Because Linus Pong worked in chemistry and chemistry is not that sexiest subject to many citizens in the United States, cosmology, theoretical physics, things like that.

181
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Things that Einstein was involved in or Carl Sagan was involved in seemed to resonate with people, but chemistry is a little bit difficult, a little bit oblique to many people.

182
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So we thought that having an exhibition devoted to Linus Pong and all facets of his career as a humanitarian, as an activist, as a scientist, as a medical researcher, would be a way of honoring Linus Pong, his legacy and also introducing his incredible work to school children

183
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and people around the world. It was hugely successful.

184
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Millions of people saw it in locations in Europe and Japan and many locations in the United States.

185
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It was terrifically well executed and designed, very, very diligent and creative design people working with Soka Gakai,

186
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:00,000
transformed the exhibit or designed the exhibit to fit into the available spaces in DC and San Francisco and Boston and everyone who saw the exhibit really thought it was very, very impressive.

187
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And actually Soka Gakai, when the exhibit had finished touring, gave all the elements of the Linus Pong exhibition to Oregon State University.

188
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Can you be very deploying a little bit? I'm wondering, did you ever go to Dear Flat Ranch?

189
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I did. I went down to Dear Flat Ranch. They had a little guest house that was built.

190
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think at the south end of the beach adjacent to the main house. And I went down fairly late in Paulings' life.

191
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think it must have been around 1993, perhaps even 1994 when I went there.

192
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And my visit was associated with a deposition that our attorneys were doing of Linus Pong related to litigation with health now in the TS rat.

193
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I remember driving down and taking him the Sunday paper, because I know that he always liked to read the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle on the funny.

194
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I took him that large paper and visited him at Dear Flat Ranch and got to see the house and wandered around the beach and it was very, very enjoyable.

195
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It was a little sad too because it was difficult to see him somewhat incapacitated, but it was really a terrific experience to be there.

196
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I'm trying to get a sense of the space here that is a very important place to find.

197
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it was easy to see why it was so important to him because it was very remote and secluded.

198
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
There were no distractions, a terrific natural environment in the house, perched on a bluff overlooking the ocean.

199
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Very tranquil space. And I think it's easy to see how he got a lot done there.

200
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Without any internet connection or fact, I believe he might have installed a fact machine later on, but I was an ideal place for him to work and think with that distractions.

201
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because when he was in Palo Alto, he was a very famous man, and his time was sought by many people from many different reasons.

202
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Old friends, colleagues, the public media.

203
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And I think it was difficult for him to concentrate at his office at the one that's playing it to be science medicine, at least on page Mel Road, because there were so many demands on his time.

204
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
When he retreated to Deerflat Ranch, he removed himself from that contact, that connection.

205
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So I think he really loved that time alone down there.

206
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you know what it is about?

207
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I believe the property is still owned by the family.

208
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But I'm not exactly sure what they intend to do with it.

209
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't have a good sense of what's only good for fun.

210
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Have any ideas on that regard?

211
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, I know that he'd like to watch some programs on TV, some serialized programs. He read quite a lot.

212
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He'd love to read mystery books.

213
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And I think we may have talked about that in our earlier conversation.

214
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I would loan him mystery books, and he would loan me books.

215
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Actually, a lot of his books before he died ended up at a bookstore in California Avenue in Palo Alto.

216
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because he would stop in that bookstore and trade books.

217
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It was a bookstore where you could trade or sell your used books for books that they had in stock.

218
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So I remember looking through the bookstore and finding Glenn's punk's name and many of the books in the mystery and science fiction area that he had brought in to trade for other books that he was interested in reading.

219
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He didn't seem to have much interest in cinema, in plays, in show business arts, fine art, music.

220
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I didn't seem to be anything that came up very often in conversation.

221
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So he did not really seek out those kinds of experiences. I think he was happiest just doing his own work thinking about scientific problems.

222
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The few times that I had cocktails with him in his apartment at Stanford, he was happy to sit and talk about a wide range of things.

223
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And he liked to drink vodka, and we would typically have vodka and tonic.

224
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Sometimes he would just drink straight up vodka or maybe with water and talk about a wide range of subjects.

225
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But popular culture, the arts were really not, I don't think, of great interest in him.

226
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So he was a rare individual in that there was really no division between, in my mind, what he did recreationally and what he did professionally.

227
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And he was a scientist through and through and derived pleasure from working on scientific problems.

228
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And that pleasure, I don't think, was to be substituted for pleasure and other activities.

229
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm sure that he did a lot of things on his own, or with his wife traveling and so forth and visiting different places with his wife that were enjoyable to him.

230
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But when I knew him best, laid in life after his wife, it died and didn't seem that he was that engaged in activities other than science.

231
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, well, I have a little list of personality characteristics that are often assigned to the point out that I'm hoping you would reflect on some of these.

232
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay.

233
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The first one is work ethic.

234
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh, he was very industrious.

235
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Very industrious.

236
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He worked all the time.

237
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
As a matter of fact, I remember going to parties at his house in Port Old Valley and using the restaurant, the bathroom.

238
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And oftentimes, if you go into someone's bathroom, you'll find prevention magazine, a reader's digest, or entertainment weekly, or time, or the newspaper or something.

239
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And Paulings bathroom was stack of journals, scientific journals.

240
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well, I think it goes about saying that he was extraordinarily creative and had an interesting way of visualizing and thinking about scientific problems and issues.

241
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So I think in terms of creativity, I can't think that at least in the scientific realm that he's surpassed by anyone, really.

242
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:34,000
When you think about the nature of his stunning contributions to molecular medicine, molecular biology, chemical bond, I don't think he gets much more creative than that.

243
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
His memory was prodigious.

244
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's rare that you encounter someone who has such a clear memory of so many details.

245
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And Pauling was very frequently able to recite the co-authors of papers that had been published, not just his own papers, but other papers that had been published 30, 40 years earlier, the date and the journal.

246
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And basically could give you an abstract of that particular paper.

247
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So he had an incredible memory, and I think that is one of the reasons he was able to make so much progress in science.

248
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He was able to conjure facts from deep in his memory about perhaps unrelated topics and fit them together in a real synergistic way and make new discoveries.

249
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I have felt my father also had a stunning memory.

250
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I won't say it was photographic, but it was close to being a photographic. He was able laid in life to remember things that he had learned as an undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology that I found very surprising.

251
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I would try to stump him with calculus problems when he was a businessman and he was not stumpable.

252
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And Pauling was very similar, perhaps even better than my father on the memory score.

253
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
How would he go?

254
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, I think Linus Pauling had a healthy ego. I think he was well aware of his abilities.

255
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Some people I think misinterpret that confidence in his own abilities as arrogance, and I never really interpreted that way.

256
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It seemed to me that he knew what he was talking about.

257
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He was able to justify his opinion or his statements about various issues which he was talking.

258
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And I think he had a very healthy ego.

259
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Did you ever see an angry?

260
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's see.

261
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm not sure that I ever saw him angry.

262
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I saw him when he was less than happy, but I'm not sure that that would qualify as angry.

263
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I've seen him concerned and maybe sad, but I'm not really angry.

264
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Although I'm sure you get, for instance, during the Mayo Clinic in Brollio in the late 1970s and mid 1980s he had every right to be very angry.

265
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And perhaps he expressed his anger to some of the participants in that controversy, but I never saw him angry.

266
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He tended to move somewhat slowly.

267
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Sometimes that was because he was carrying a heavy box with him with correspondence and books and paper.

268
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So he never really seemed to be fatigued. He wasn't physically vigorous.

269
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
At the time I knew him at the Lines Points 2 Science and Medicine, but he certainly didn't seem fatigued,

270
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but he was not physically dynamic person.

271
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
How did he handle disappointment?

272
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
There were a lot of grant applications in the late 1970s.

273
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, I think he was disappointed, clearly, and all the emotions that go along were being disappointed.

274
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But he never felt ejected because I think he felt that he knew better than many of the people who were denying him the grant funds.

275
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And knew what was required to participate in the grant funding game and was playing it.

276
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And he was disappointed that he wasn't rewarded by playing the game appropriately and the way he'd been told to play it by the funding agencies.

277
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So he was somewhat shagrin that he couldn't get the money from federal agencies to do the kind of research that he felt was very important.

278
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I didn't see him angry at particular people, but he was unhappy that he couldn't get financial support to do work that he felt would be very important in public health.

279
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
For instance, the vitamin C and cancer work is a case in point.

280
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:10,000
When Cameron had started treating terminal cancer patients hospitalized, waiting to die with high dose, intravenous, and oral vitamin C,

281
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and reported to the polling that some of these people were having very dramatic responses.

282
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Paulian Cameron collected a lot of the data, pathology, histology, x-rays, so forth.

283
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And the polling felt that that data was probably persuasive enough to get the National Cancer Institute to set up randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy of vitamin C and cancer.

284
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Learn more about it.

285
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And the reception he got by the NCI was very negative.

286
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And they always found a reason that maybe vitamin C wasn't responsible for this response.

287
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Maybe it was coincident with something else.

288
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And Paulian said, well, that's exactly why I want these clinical trials to be carried out to find out whether this has value.

289
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And if, totally, we have the evidence that has value, now we need to find out whether it does truly have value.

290
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And NCI had sort of an odd perspective on the problem.

291
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:17,000
They wanted Paulian to apply for funds to study this in cell cultures and animals, animal models, like mice or rats.

292
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So Cameron already had some clinical evidence, but they wanted to turn the wheelbarrow upside down and start with cell cultures and animals.

293
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So typically, the normal scientific trajectory would be to establish biological plausibility and see effects in cell culture models.

294
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then move on into animal models to find out if you can replicate the in vitro results in an in vivo model.

295
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And then if that's all promising, then you move eventually into a clinical translation of this modality.

296
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And Paulian and Cameron were actually starting at the end of that tri-partate paradigm.

297
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And he wasn't anxious to go back and start with cell cultures and the animals.

298
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So it was, I think, excuse me, a bit frustrating to him and to learn to you and Cameron that they were being forced to start at the beginning when they already had results in people.

299
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It seemed to be very promising and they believed would be sufficient to set up a randomized clinical trial to test this in people.

300
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Were you in all, privy to or involved, or and I was ever to grab a fair doubt, he's collaboration with Paulian.

301
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well, Robert Paredowski, of course, visited the Institute many times because he was,

302
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Paulian's official biographer.

303
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So he came to talk with Paulian, talk with Dorothy Monroe, talk with people, colleagues at the Institute and elsewhere, many, many times over the years.

304
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And I got to know him reasonably well.

305
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I never had much input there.

306
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I believe I may have spoken to him in the 1990s about some of the litigation and Robinson and rap issues.

307
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I really don't know the status of the biography.

308
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I have no idea.

309
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I wish a grin to learn at one point that he had no book contract.

310
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And it seems to me that if you have a book contract then that implies deadline and you've got to have a product by a certain date that the publisher is interested in producing.

311
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I was surprised to find that apparently Robert Paredowski never had a book contract and was doing this presumably in hopes of shopping and around the different publishers at some later date.

312
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But I think a book contract would have really been terrific catalysts to get in that project completed.

313
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Tom Hager, I talked with him, I like his book very much actually.

314
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I think it's probably the best biography of wine is falling.

315
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And Tom of course had some access to falling late in his career and visited the Institute several times.

316
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I was interested in, I thought that the last chapter in the end of the book to coincide with the end of the polling life was perhaps a little bit abrupt.

317
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And it was interested in working with Tom to develop that a little bit more thoroughly,

318
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
especially with respect to the rapid litigation.

319
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But I think the publisher was interested in getting the book on the shelves.

320
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Excuse me, not long after Linus plunged death in August of 1994.

321
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I think the book appeared in the fall of 1994.

322
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So I think that they were interested in wrapping it up and getting it out there to sell.

323
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
While polling was still in recent memory in the news because that would have been a good marketing opportunity for them.

324
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I have since talked with Tom although I don't know if he has any desire to do this or his publisher has any desire to do this in

325
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Perhaps a new edition of his book which would wrap up some of the loose ends that were left dangling in the original book.

326
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He has published a book written of course.

327
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thanks.

328
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Does that have a little bit more to do?

329
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No, I didn't know that.

330
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
No, very interesting.

331
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
How about the drizzles or anything?

332
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
No.

333
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
No, I never had any contact as far as I can remember with Seraphini or the Gertzels.

334
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I read their books.

335
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I thought they were interesting.

336
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I mean, I think no book is perfect and all have some failures or defects.

337
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I think those two books have their share of failures and defects.

338
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But I couldn't call and use the media here today.

339
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Well, I think polling as a result of his campaign to end atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons

340
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and his political activities in the 1950s learned pretty well how to use the media.

341
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And I was struck by his facility with the media.

342
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I mean, he gave hundreds or thousands of interviews to journalists and media representatives throughout his life.

343
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And he knew what the audience was and he knew what part of the story to give to the particular interviewer for that particular audience.

344
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And he was extremely good at describing pretty complex scientific phenomena in ways that perhaps the average intelligent person can understand and grasp them.

345
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He was a terrific speaker and was able to distill pretty complicated ideas down to easily digestible communications.

346
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I mean, what are instances that you may remember that we're calling David.

347
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I mean, did you make a publication that you used to use on a frequent one fall from that?

348
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
No, what?

349
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A frequent one fall or a bump in the amount of correspondence you're receiving right?

350
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

351
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well, of course, during the male clinic in Brolyo, there was quite a lot of communication between the public and the institute and the line is falling because at that time,

352
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:37,000
although Cameron and Pauling pointed out that Craig and Mortel who organized and carried out that male clinic, those male clinic studies too, which were published, had not really read Cameron or Pauling's papers.

353
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And we're not prepared to reproduce Cameron's work, technically.

354
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So they never gave any vitamin C interventionously.

355
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And there were other problems with male clinic studies that have been dealt with that length by other people.

356
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So when people heard that the famous male clinic had apparently objectively evaluated high dose vitamin C cancer and came up with negative findings, there was kind of a flood of questions about this.

357
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And Pauling and Cameron had prepared criticism of the male clinic studies, and those were provided to people who were interested.

358
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I think that the only, I can't remember exactly big windfalls, financial windfalls to the institute from the direct male program as a result of public statements by Linus Pauling or other people at the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, but I do remember that there were negative consequences from both the male clinic studies.

359
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And somewhat later when people discovered that the institute was doing work on HIV, not AIDS, but HIV infection, cell culture work and the effect of vitamin C in inhibiting replication of the virus, responsible for AIDS.

360
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
There were people that had moral problems with that work for whatever reason.

361
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And some donations dropped off as a result of that.

362
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What do you hear since the following attitude was, of course, might especially in this young life?

363
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Well, yeah, I don't think money was an issue for him, at least during the time I knew him, on the latter third of his life.

364
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I feel fairly confident in saying that he didn't have any personal money problems. He loaned money to the institute many times, directed royalties from books to come to the institute, so if he had needed money personally, I don't think he would have done that, for instance.

365
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So to me, he seemed like a very generous person, financially. He was giving money to the institute. He was trying to find money for the institute to carry out research that he felt was important.

366
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So he seemed to be very generous and altruistic. He never seemed to be entrusted in doing anything that would raise money for him.

367
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000
For instance, the patents that he was involved in acquiring weight and life, one in superconductivity, and then patents related to liberal protein A and vitamin C.

368
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think the goal there was not to enrich himself, but to find more revenue streams for the institute so that it could do research that he felt was important.

369
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I would say that's very philanthropic attitude, very altruistic.

370
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Would you be traveling on?

371
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let's see.

372
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No, I guess I didn't. I traveled with him to City Hall in Palo Alto from his apartment, and I would often show for him from his apartment at the Stanford Campus to the Lightest Poly Institute, and take him home in the evening.

373
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Mainly because although his driver's license was still valid, he had decided not to drive so much anymore, and it gave me an opportunity to talk with him about scientific issues and administrative issues,

374
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and he could regal me with stories from his past and kind of a distraction of free environment, namely in the car while I was driving.

375
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But that's the extent of my travel with him, local travel.

376
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well, in the early 90s, he developed the illness.

377
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It would eventually take his wife to try to treat that with an external treatment.

378
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Well, when he went public with the diagnosis of prostate cancer, of course many people were shocked, especially his critics.

379
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They weren't shocked, I think they were, well, I don't want to be too critical of them, but many people said we've been advocating

380
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
vitamin C for all these years and taking vitamin C for all these years and now you've got cancer.

381
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
How do you explain that?

382
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And probably had a very rational, non-defensive response, which was most elderly men develop hyperplastic or hyperplasia in their prostate.

383
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Most elderly men at autopsy are found to have cancerous cells in their prostate, and it's just not uncommon.

384
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It happens to many, many elderly men, and he said it's quite likely, although not provable, and I'm paraphrasing, that his high intake of vitamin C delayed the inevitable by 20 years and more.

385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because he died at the age of 93 and a half, and of course many men start to develop prostate problems 20 years earlier than that.

386
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So it's not a provable assertion, but I think it's just as reasonable as any other assertion about their relationship with vitamin C to his cancer.

387
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:19,000
He treated himself both with high dose vitamin C, although I believe he did not take intravenous vitamin C, perhaps just oral vitamin C, which is a little surprising, but on the other hand, the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C had not been really clearly worked out, and this was before the vitamin C transporters had been discovered.

388
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So no one really knew exactly how vitamin C got from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream and to cells and tissues.

389
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's clear that not all of it get into the bloodstream from a large and gested dose.

390
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Some was excreted, some that got absorbed was excreted, and some just passed through the intestinal tract.

391
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So the pharmacokinetics were not well understood, and it wasn't until after Pony died, that people started to look into that more carefully.

392
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And we now know, for instance, that there are active transport molecules on cells in the intestine that limit the amount of vitamin C that gets taken up by cells and move from the intestine into the bloodstream.

393
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So when you take large oral doses, you cannot get the same blood concentration of vitamin C that you can get when you get it intravenously, because then you bypass these transporters on cells and get the vitamin C directly into the bloodstream.

394
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And some work actually a lot of work suggests that one of the major anti-cancer mechanisms of high dose vitamin C is the generation of hydrogen peroxide, as a result of either auto oxidation of vitamin C or reactions of vitamin C with metals.

395
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And this seems to be selective to tumor cells, and the hydrogen peroxide diffuses into the tumor cells and disrupts their cellular machinery by different mechanisms.

396
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That wasn't really well known when Pony was self-medicating with vitamin C for his prostate cancer.

397
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So he didn't prefer intravenous vitamin C at that point, because it wasn't any perhaps clear or rational for it.

398
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I know that he had surgery, he underwent a bilateral orchectomy, and also was taken fluidumide, which is a standard chemotherapy drug for prostate cancer.

399
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And I know that he was also working with friends and colleagues at Stanford Medical School to raise monoclonal antibodies against his prostate cancer cells.

400
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And I don't really know how those things work sequentially or whether he was combining some of those modalities.

401
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm not clear about that, but I know that all those avenues were tried by him.

402
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And he was actually quite public about his treatment and about his illness.

403
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I do recall the last thing he saw in his mind.

404
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I believe the last time I saw him was when he was deposed by our lawyers in 1994.

405
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I think it was early summer, late spring, early summer of 1994, at his home in Dear Flat Ranch.

406
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What are you, what is your, what are you, memories of this, you know?

407
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, it's tough to have clear memories of such an emotional event.

408
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Linus Pauling was an unusual public figure in that many people who didn't even know him felt very strongly about him.

409
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Either possibly, or in some cases, negative way perhaps.

410
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And people who knew him really tended to love him because he was such a charming, magnanimous, and wonderful person to be around.

411
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And when he died, I think everybody that knew him was grief-stricken, myself included.

412
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And it was very difficult, I was asked to speak at that funeral as was the president of Stanford University,

413
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
or at Casper, and a number of other people.

414
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And it was very difficult to maintain composure and talk about Linus Pauling at that event.

415
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Well, the immediate fallout was probably a rise in memorial contributions in honor of Linus Pauling.

416
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We were, of course, very concerned about the long-term success of the Linus Pauling Institute,

417
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because many people who had contributed money believed rightly so in many cases that Linus Pauling was at the helm of the ship,

418
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and he was directing the research, and he was director of research at the end of his life.

419
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And we were concerned that absent Linus Pauling, people might start to lose interest in the Linus Pauling Institute and stop supporting it financially.

420
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And we had no endowment at the time, and we had some zoning problems with the building in Palo Alto.

421
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We were, you know, least building, and a commercially zone site in 440 page mail road,

422
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
which was scheduled to change to residential zoning.

423
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So we knew we had to move, and absent Linus Pauling, no endowment and moving, was quite a challenge for the Institute.

424
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And I alluded to this earlier, the Board of Trustees, Linus Pauling Jr. myself, really grappled for a long time with these issues,

425
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
thinking about different opportunities and options for relocation.

426
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And ultimately, decided to come to an academic institution,

427
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
because academic institutions, except for a few, tend to be permanent.

428
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And we started to look at academic institutions that were doing work that was compatible with Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine's mission,

429
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:42,000
where this work in North and Molecular Medicine would find a good home and be able to be carried out as a working tribute to Linus Pauling's ideas in North and Molecular Medicine.

430
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Very lucky for us during those deliberations, we were the happy recipients of a number of large bequest.

431
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And those bequest allowed us to establish at least a small endowment, I shouldn't say endowment,

432
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to have enough money to fund an endowment for the Directors Chair here at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University,

433
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
which at that time was matched by the state.

434
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So it was a functional $3 million dollar endowment, which allowed us to attract very high caliber director.

435
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And subsequently, the help of the research officer at Oregon State University,

436
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
we were able to attract high caliber faculty as well.

437
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Well, that's the end of my set of questions on the point.

438
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I guess I'll just ask you if there's anything else about the point of personality or personal characteristics,

439
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
or the relation between you and your student and your student.

440
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Well, I think I've said before, I found him to be very funny.

441
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
He was very charming, very witty, of course.

442
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I seem to know everyone, know everything.

443
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
He was just a joy to be around.

444
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And maybe I mentioned in our last interview that when Zelle Kerman and I had finally succeeded in producing some material

445
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and a superconductivity project that we all thought would exhibit a higher superconduct temperature

446
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
to see the expression of delight on Pauling's face when we showed him the material that we produced

447
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
was extremely memorable.

448
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I have vivid memories of that because he was just as gleeful as a teenager on a first date

449
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
to show him that material.

450
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
He just had a real joy for scientific discovery.

451
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And I think that was the thing that most motivated him in life.
