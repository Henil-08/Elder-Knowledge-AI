1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I think in your notes that you're.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, as in the past, do you use yourself and get things?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Steve Lawson.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's the 8th of November, 2011.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're in a room in the Valley Library.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, our past interviews, we parked mainly by your way to the point.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I want to start doing, you know,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm talking with this interview.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And over the next seven years,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we've got a little talk about the experience.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And so, I'm wondering,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because if you call anything about your initial interview,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
then don't you ask them back in 1978?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
After I graduated from college,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I spent a fairly parapotatic number of years traveling around the country.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Every visiting relatives and friends around the country

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and finally came back to Palo Alto, California,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
because I really truly loved the Bay Area at that time.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was very exciting to Rific Environment.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I loved everything about California, in particular the Bay Area,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
culturally or statistically,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
intellectually and very stimulating environment.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, I wanted to try to remain in the Bay Area possible.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Although I still at that point,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it was not very career oriented.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I didn't really have a very clear idea of what I wanted to do in the future.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
At some point, and I'm not exactly sure how

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I became aware of a listing for a position

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
at the one that's playing the Institute of Science in Medicine,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
which at that time was located at 2700 San Hill Road

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
in Memo Park, just opposite Stanford,

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
linear accelerator, in an office building.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Up the street from Madison Wells Lee,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and a number of other publishing houses

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that were located along that road at the time.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Property that was owned by Tom Ford,

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
who I believe was perhaps on the board justices of Stanford University

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
or large donors of Stanford University at the time.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, it was in 1977 that I interviewed for a position at the Institute.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And the initial position was part-time.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then in February of 1978,

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it turned into a full-time salary position.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Initially, I interviewed with Korean Gorham,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I believe, who was the Secretary of the Institute

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and head of HR department,

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
for whatever that was worth at the time,

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
fairly small organization still.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I guess she was sufficiently impressed

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to ask me to come back to meet with Art Robinson,

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
who was the President Director of the Institute.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And Art had recently, in 1976,

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
1977, set up a program of direct mail solicitation

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
in order to bolster the financial base of the Institute

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
because grants were very hard to come by.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And in particular, the work on Vitamin C,

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that Linus Pauling felt so strongly about,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
was very hard to fund.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So they turned to the public for funding source.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And that resulted in buying and trading mailing list

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to primarily to magazines

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that whose subscribers might be interested

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in the mission and the work of the Linus Pauling Institute

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
magazines in particular, like Prevention,

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
which in those days had a much less pharmaceutical orientation

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that it has today.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was kind of a companion publication to Rodeals

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
organic farming and gardening magazine.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I think Rodeal Press had kind of an

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
orthomolecular perspective on not just farming and gardening,

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
but also on health.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And in those days, they emphasize nutrition

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and vitamin supplements and things like that.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that seemed like a very lightly candidate

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
for raising money to support research efforts

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and that program was very successful.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So it resulted in a tremendous amount of mail

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and processing of donations.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So the job, the specific job that I interviewed for at that time,

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
had to do with,

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that was related to this direct mail program,

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
processing of donations.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And also, initially, some fairly rudimentaries,

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
statistical analyses of the donations,

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
where they were coming from, the magnitude of donations,

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
what mailing lists were succeeding,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
which were failing, and so forth.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So that was what I was doing initially.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What was your impression of the institution

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
for the directly adapted there?

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, I thought the atmosphere at the Institute was quite collegial.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The Institute shared that building on San Hill Road

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
with Kemper insurance.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So the Institute did not have access to all the

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
rooms in the building.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And it was clear that what had been built

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and designed as an office building had been renovated

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to some extent to accommodate the Institute's research.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it wasn't really laid out optimally as a research facility,

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but nevertheless, I think they did a terrific job

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
of shoe-harning the various research programs

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
into the available space.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I'd have to consult notes.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't remember how many square feet.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know that the next facility on page mill road

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for 40 page mill road was over 20,000 square feet.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So this facility was less than 20,000 square feet

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
available to the Institute.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And there were programs in metabolite profiling,

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
or metabolic profiling, under way,

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
as well as vitamin C and cancer,

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and some other sundry studies that did not require

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
large laboratory facility.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There was a lot of chemical work on vitamin C

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
done by Connie Chow at the time under

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Polling's direction, which didn't really require

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
a lot of floor space in a laboratory.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then there were also animal experiments underway,

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
which did require quite a lot of square footage

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to carry out.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then of course there was the volcano source

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
field ionization mass spectrometer,

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
which was a lab unto itself.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And that was being developed by Bill Abert

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
who was a physicist, formerly an SRI,

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
which was near the US geographical survey,

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
geological survey facility in Menel Park.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And also I think originally had some

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
relationship with Stanford University,

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
but then had become independent.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's where I actually learned to do so culture work.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When I set up the first so culture facility

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
at the Institute a while later.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think that everybody seemed to be very friendly

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and very dedicated to the work they were doing.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was particularly struck by the dedication of art Robinson

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and Rick Hicks, who was the Executive Vice President

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
in charge of fundraising.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And you and Cameron, who had come by from time to time,

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
who was a non-resident fellow.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I believe at the time.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And later became medical director of the Institute

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and moved to California.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But in those days in San Hill Road,

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
he was still I believe non-resident fellow.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Carrying up the clinical collaboration with minus Paul

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and Scotland.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I would say that everyone was extremely enthusiastic

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and dedicated.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It seemed to be a pretty cohesive group.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And that part of the ambience there really appealed to me.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So as far as a working environment,

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it seemed to be quite good.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It wasn't until a little later that there was a schism

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that developed between art Robinson and minus Paul

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
or things tended to become awkward

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and sourd a little at that time.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What was Robinson?

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're actually delighted that one.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I would say he was.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, he actually hired me.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I interviewed with him.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I found him to be a very intense, motivated person.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I liked him.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I thought his personality, as I said,

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
was quite intense.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But he seemed to be very bright,

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
very sharp, very insightful.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I enjoyed working with him

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and for him in the direct mail program.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Excuse me.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
As this schism developed between Robinson and Paul

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and Robinson was no longer physically present

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in the Institute, I had been working.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Actually, I think, almost from the inception

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
of my employment at the Institute,

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
as time permitted in scientific operations,

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Alan Sheets was a biochemist who was doing work on vitamin C

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and also in the vitamin C and skin cancer experiments

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that were being overseen by Robinson and Pauling at that time.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Alan and I really hit it all together

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and liked to talk about science.

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Of course, I had some background in science.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's Stanford.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They were sometimes short-staffed in the scientific sector

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and I would volunteer to do work with the animals

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
in the laboratory.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I think I had an aptitude for that work

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and some competence as well.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And that was recognized by Alan and Dick will be

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
another people who were involved in that realm at the time.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So, gradually, my responsibilities,

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
my activity shifted from the direct mail campaign

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to working as a research assistant

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
in the laboratory environment.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm the old Zudrkello,

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I am in the February 1977 McLean Institute.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What was the goal at that time?

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
A meal had been a non-resident fellow.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I believe of the Institute and then joined the Institute

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to work with Pauling and to continue independent work

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
on the journal Molecular Evolution,

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
which he was the founding editor of.

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And he had some pretty interesting ideas

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that were mainly theoretical in nature.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And so, I mean, it didn't really need a laboratory

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to carry out his work at the time.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Of course, he and Pauling had known each other for a very long time.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The Zudrkello I believe had been at Caltech.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And the two of them had developed this concept

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of chemical paleogenetics,

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or molecular evolution in probably the late 50s,

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
or early 60s, was published in the early 1960s,

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
which Francis Crick thought was one of Pauling's major achievements.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And I think actually most of it was probably due to Zudrkello's ideas,

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but nevertheless, together they developed this very interesting idea

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
of dating the divergence of species,

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
based upon similarities in hemoglobin,

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
which are shared in a molecule which shared them

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for many million species for the great species.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A meal was a very interesting,

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
very kindly person.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He was definitely European in nature,

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and seemed to be extremely intelligent.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
A meal was one of the rare individuals

229
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
who could hold many competitive ideas

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
in his mind simultaneously and expound upon each of them in turn.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So I found him very, a very challenging intellect,

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and I really enjoyed talking with him.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Sometime later I started working,

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was working for different groups within the Institute,

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
all of which were quite small,

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and a meal and I got along so well

237
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that a meal wanted me to do more and more work with him.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This was after he became President Director of the Institute

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
after the departure of Art Robinson.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And that led to kind of a long collaboration

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
with a meal that culminated in my appointment

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
as a co-director of the laboratory

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
for research and gene regulation in the mid-1980s.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A meal at that time was very interested in cancer metastasis

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and what genes, what proteins were involved

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in the development of that phenotype,

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because many people who suffer and die from cancer

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
will die from metastatic involvement.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Even if the primary tumor is surgically treated,

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
or treated successfully with radiation and chemotherapy,

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it's often not possible to kill all the metastatic cells

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that can move through the lymph system or through the blood system

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and colonize other tissues.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So a meal was very interested in that,

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and we set up a program at the Institute

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to use a technique called two-dimensional polycholomy gel electrophoresis.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Excuse me, to profile proteins,

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
present in tumor cells and metastatic tumor cells

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
related to the primary tumor and also normal tissue

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to look for proteins that might be involved

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and therefore genes that might be involved in the development

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
of this phenotype.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I think a meal had the idea at that time

264
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
that these might be regulatory proteins,

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
which would be present in very small amounts in cells.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So we had to set up a cell culture laboratory, which I did,

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
bought all the equipment, read a lot about tissue culture

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and what was important and what kind of equipment would be appropriate.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Learn the techniques at SRI,

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and also learn some techniques at UCSD

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and University of Colorado in Boulder about to find media

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
because we were very interested in eliminating

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
or perhaps eliminating it's not the right word,

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and we went into the greatest extent possible

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
the amount of noise in the system.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And we wanted to increase reproducibility

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
of our protein profile as well

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
because if regulatory proteins are involved in this process

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
of metastatic cancer,

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
then we need to be able to detect them.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And to detect them,

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
we need to increase reproducibility

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and decrease noise in the system.

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I spent quite a lot of time

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with my colleague Stuart McGuire

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and Eddie Metz and Mark Pack and others

287
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in trying to perfect that system.

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So was it the kind of main aim

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that pretty active research program

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
even though he was listening more and more

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
at Metastatic cancer as well?

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He did.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's right.

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He did assume more and more administrative load.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Pauling, of course,

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think had plenty of aptitude for administration

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
but was less interested in administration.

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Pauling really wanted to concentrate on a theoretical work,

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
his clinical work,

300
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the vitamin C work,

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
or the molecular medical work.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And Suka Kondo,

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
from a research perspective,

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
was probably a little broader

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in what he wanted the institute to become.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And as his influence in administration increased

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and the funding available to the institute increased,

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the focus of the institute also broadened

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to be much more kind of a molecular biological approach

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to health and disease rather than specifically focused

311
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
on North and Molecular Medicine.

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So, for instance, the program that I was involved in

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
looking at gene regulation and cancer

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
really had nothing to do specifically

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
with North and Molecular Medicine and Nutrition.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So, I think Emil had a vision for the institute

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
as something like the Salk Institute in Mahalia

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
or the Institute that he had founded in France

319
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and left before he joined the line

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
in his Polynes Institute of Science in Medicine,

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
which was much more of a molecular biological approach

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
to science.

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The mission is intelligence,

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
how will you characterize this personality?

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, I think that he was very kinetic,

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
he's very tall, lean person,

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
had a lot of physical energy,

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
as well as mental stamina and vigor.

329
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And also had a very European attitude about things.

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think in some ways the served him well

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and in some ways it may not have served him terribly well

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
because the administration of the institute

333
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
became a little bit of a black box

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and perhaps was not quite as transparent

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
as it could have been that would have promoted

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
better relations among employees much later

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
in the history of the institute.

338
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And this is an extension of the European attitude.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I think so.

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I mean it's hard to say I'm not a psychologist

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and I don't know that much about

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
European political systems

343
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but I think Emil was kind of a benevolent king.

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, at the more personal or social level

345
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we have mental interactions with the people that come to mind.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, I had many, many interactions

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
with Emil over the years.

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He had a terrific sense of humor

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and not so much in a joke telling way

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but a good sense of irony

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and we got along very, very well.

352
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I think Emil depended upon me

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and Eddie Metz, who was another research associate

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
to answer to.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And a number of other people within his group

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to help him make decisions about hiring,

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
for instance.

358
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So there were a number of people who came to the institute

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and went through a review process

360
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
candidates for certain positions

361
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and Eddie Metz and myself and some others

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think played pretty critical roles

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
in those processes at the time

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because Emil rightly or wrongly

365
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think trusted my judgment about people

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and I would give him very candid observations

367
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to the best extent I could

368
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
about potential candidates

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
for positions within the institute.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We also shared an appreciation of art

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
so Emil and his wife Jane

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
lived in a penthouse apartment

373
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
on a raster deero in Palo Alto

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and I was relatively frequent guest

375
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and we would talk about art, talk about Emil's heritage,

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
his ancestors, his grandparents, his parents were all

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
very famous in the respective fields

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
both in psychology, psychoanalysis, anatomy, art

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and I remember one time Emil showed me

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
he was a bit embarrassed about it

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
because it's not something that has a lot of

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
objective value but he knew I would be interested

383
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
in his autograph book

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
which he had maintained as a kid

385
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
in his grandmother's salon

386
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and had signatures in this book

387
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
from Sigmund Freud

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and a number of other very famous people musicians

389
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and scientists, I can't recall exactly who now

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but it was pretty impressive to see at the time

391
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
was he a cognitive audience?

392
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't think he had the financial

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
wherewithal to collect art

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but he had had art that he inherited from the family

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and Emil's family was Jewish

396
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and had lived in both Austria, Vienna and France

397
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and during the Nazi occupation

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and Nazi infiltration of countries in Europe

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
his family was forced to flee

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and often fled without their possession

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so I know many years later he showed me a catalog

402
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
of German art and architecture

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
in which his parents chairs were featured

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and these were chairs that were part of

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the old Zupacondal home

406
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that they'd been forced to abandon

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
when the Nazis arrived

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and he had remnants of some art

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that he'd been able to take with him

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Gustav Klimt, triptych and things like that

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
which I think he'd given away actually at that time

412
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but he did have some art and some books

413
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that managed to survive that ugly process in Europe

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay, well I want to talk about our Robinson

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and then it's your first of all

416
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
knowing what your sense of being as a scientist

417
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
was when you initially met Emil after moving

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, that's a good question

419
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I would say that I did not have enough science

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
at that time to offer any judgment on art Robinson

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I knew that he was working very closely with Linus Polling

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
so I assumed that he must be brilliant

423
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
because I doubted that Linus Polling would tolerate fools

424
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and research was clearly the most important thing

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
in Polling's life, research and science

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and I just imagine that art Robinson

427
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
must be a terrifically intelligent person

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
working with Linus Polling because otherwise he wouldn't be

429
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
at the Institute

430
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He seemed to have Polling's trust

431
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and many people had pretty high regard for art Robinson

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
called him kind of the boy Wonder

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He was quite young at that time as well

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
maybe in his 30s I believe

435
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
when he was president director of the Institute

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
so he'd come up from UCSD to take a position

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
in Polling's lab at Stanford

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and then together with King Dimit co-founded

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the Institute

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
while the Institute was still located at Stanford

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and then when they were able to secure

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
a rental site in this building on San Hill Road

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and they moved physically the Institute

444
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
transferred the grants to the San Hill Road location

445
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I had a very favorable impression of art

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I liked him quite a lot

447
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and he seemed to be incredibly driven

448
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I didn't know at that time anything

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
about his politics, his religion

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
or anything I never asked him about those things

451
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I never talked to them about those things

452
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
it was all strictly science

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but I really enjoyed my interactions with him at that time

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and I was not high enough up in the food chain

455
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the bureaucracy within the Institute

456
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
to really understand at the time

457
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the nature of the conflict that developed

458
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
between art Robinson and Linus Polling

459
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
so I was completely in the dark

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
as to why that developed and why art left the Institute

461
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
but there were a series of very

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
bewildering memos at that time

463
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I remember after art left

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and of course there was gossip about

465
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
what was going on and who was in charge

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and what had happened and so forth

467
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't really remember the gossip very clearly

468
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but I do remember coming into my office one day

469
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and finding a memo from Linus Polling

470
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
a couple of short paragraphs explaining that art Robinson

471
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
had absented himself from the Institute

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and was no longer serving as a president

473
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
director, Linus Polling was taking over that position

474
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and I should ignore

475
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
directives from art Robinson

476
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that was followed the next day

477
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
by a memo from art Robinson

478
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
the effect that Linus Polling had no authority

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to remove from his position

480
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
disregard the earlier memo from Linus Polling

481
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and things like that went back and forth for a while

482
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
so it was a period of tension

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to say the least at the Institute

484
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
people were a little bewildered as to what to do

485
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
but I think ultimately because Linus Polling

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
was chairman of the board

487
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and the Institute was named for him

488
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and I think people just inferred

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that Linus Polling was in charge

490
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and therefore Linus Polling was the one who

491
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
had the authority to say on what the status of art Robinson

492
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
was at that time

493
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So when you think about a Robinson

494
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
as a personality in intense peace and view

495
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
or that comes to life

496
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yes, he was very intense, very driven

497
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
no question about that

498
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and he had a very robust family life

499
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I mean he was very

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
his wife, Laura Lee Robinson

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
at the time was working at the Institute

502
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
in the data acquisition

503
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and analysis from the metabolic profiling program

504
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so she was there quite often

505
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
she was a very lovely person

506
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I liked her very much as well

507
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and together they seemed like a very good pair

508
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
very happy married couple

509
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it was quite a shock when she died so suddenly

510
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and art of course had small children

511
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
that he had to turn his attention to and to raise

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and it just seemed like a very stressful time

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
for everyone

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
the combination of Laura Lee's

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
very abrupt death

516
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
art having these young kids to take care of now

517
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and also having this problem with Linus Polling

518
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and essentially losing his job at the Institute

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I do remember

520
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
that prior to this schism with Linus Polling

521
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
there had been several meetings

522
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
in the Institute's library

523
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
about the future at the Institute

524
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and the prospect of moving to Oregon

525
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
had been raised by our Robinson specifically at that time

526
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the late 1970s

527
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Art had talked about property in Oregon

528
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and if my memory serves me

529
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I think it was near Eugene or Junction City

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that might be available at low cost

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
for the Institute to buy

532
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and build a building and set up laboratories there

533
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and I think that there was an informal poll

534
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
taken amongst staff as to whom

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'd be interested in relocating to Oregon at that time

536
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
not many people weren't

537
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Do you know anything more about where

538
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
this idea came from along Oregon?

539
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't

540
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But I should say also that when the schism

541
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
between Polling and Art developed

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
it occurred to me that that might have been one of the factors

543
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
that led to this problem

544
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
because Polling of course had a very close relationship

545
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
with friends and faculty at Stanford

546
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
still, Hard McConnell

547
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and we tab a number of other people

548
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in the chemistry department there and elsewhere

549
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
you had homes in Portola Valley and Big Sur

550
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and it didn't seem to me that he would want

551
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
at his age and station in life to move to Oregon

552
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and I was never at that time I wondered

553
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
whether that was part of the problem

554
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that had developed between them

555
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So in hindsight, did you have any other

556
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
thoughts on what life was given?

557
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well, when I became chief executive officer

558
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
or executive officer in the Linus Plan Institute

559
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
in the early 1990s

560
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I was talking about the Institute

561
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
before lots of groups quite often

562
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and consequently I had to familiarize myself

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
pretty quickly with the history of the Institute

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and some of the major figures in the Institute

565
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
so I really had to learn a lot more about Linus

566
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Polling his career than I previously had known

567
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and I had to learn about art Robinson

568
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and some of the activities

569
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
that had transpired over the Institute over the years

570
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
so I looked at some of the depositions

571
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I looked at the court papers that were now available

572
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
to me as executive officer

573
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and I read that material quite carefully at the time

574
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
because I wanted to be able to represent the story accurately

575
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and to the best of my ability

576
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
so I thought it was incumbent upon me to learn

577
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
as much as I could about that problem

578
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that developed between Robinson and Polling

579
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
so that I would have a good understanding of it

580
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and I wouldn't be simply melving some person's opinion

581
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
of what had happened

582
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
but I'd actually formed an opinion myself

583
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
based on original research

584
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
into the raw data if you will

585
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and that led me to the conclusion

586
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that there were administrator problems

587
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that had developed between Robinson and Polling

588
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
it didn't have anything to do with the results

589
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
from the vitamin C and skin cancer experiments

590
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
as far as I could tell as Art Robinson portrayed

591
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
the whole problem

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Art said that the anomalous results

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
at low dose supplemental vitamin C

594
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that actually resulted in increased

595
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
number of tumors in these hairless mice

596
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
exposed to ultraviolet light

597
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
if

598
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
if you extrapolated that to people

599
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
it would be people would be at risk

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
for developing cancer

601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
let's say skin cancer in this case

602
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
after doses of supplementary vitamin C

603
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that Polling was recommending for good health

604
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but there was a significant problem

605
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
in that argument

606
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and the problem is that mice synthesize vitamin C

607
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I believe even Art himself

608
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
at the time had suggested that the exogenous vitamin C

609
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
given in the diet to these mice

610
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
might have affected their endogenous synthesis

611
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
of vitamin C

612
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
especially at low dose

613
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and Connie Chow and a number of other people

614
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
paying loan

615
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
at the institute looked into that

616
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
four line is pond very carefully

617
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and found that sure enough

618
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
when you give small extra doses of vitamin C to mice

619
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
you actually decrease the amount of vitamin C

620
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
in blood and various organs and tissues

621
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
compared to the mice getting no extra vitamin C

622
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and you actually have to overcome that

623
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
by giving much larger amounts of vitamin C

624
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and then you start to see increases in vitamin C

625
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
in these various tissues and organs

626
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and the blood

627
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and also protection against the development of skin cancer

628
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
caused by exposure to ultraviolet light

629
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
so it has nothing to do with people

630
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
because we don't synthesize vitamin C

631
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so supplemental vitamin C doesn't interfere

632
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
with anything that we're doing

633
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
or delivers unlike the mice

634
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
so that argument that art put forward

635
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to explain this problem with lion's pollen

636
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
didn't seem to hold water to me

637
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and I looked more carefully at some of the administrative decisions

638
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that would be made at that time

639
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
specifically with respect to Richard Hicks

640
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and affiliation with a group in Santa Cruz

641
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the Hansburgers

642
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that pollen was not very happy about

643
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and Hansburgers were very interested in wheatgrass

644
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and abscystic acid

645
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
as having cancer prevention

646
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
or therapeutic properties

647
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and some experiments

648
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
along those lines were carried out at the Institute

649
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
where wheatgrass was being fed

650
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
to mice to find out if it could protect them against cancer

651
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but pollen I think and I never talked to him about this

652
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but inferring from what I read

653
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it seemed to me that he was concerned about

654
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
somewhat flaky character of this operation

655
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
in Santa Cruz

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and he was worried about a close affiliation

657
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because the work that he was already advocating

658
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and trying to get funded seemed to be very controversial anyway

659
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and I don't think he wanted to encourage

660
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
even more skepticism about the Institute's activities

661
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
by getting associated with

662
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
fringe or what he might consider fringe organizations

663
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Robinson had a different perspective

664
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and also I think pollen had set up

665
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
an executive committee composed of himself

666
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Rick Hicks and Art

667
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and I believe that Art was asked not to make any important decisions

668
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
without approval of these executive committee

669
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and Art essentially ignored that

670
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and wanted to fire Rick Hicks

671
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and pollen liked Hicks

672
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and thought he was doing a good job

673
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
so I think that the conflict that developed between them

674
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
had to do with administrative issues

675
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
had to run and govern the line as plans

676
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to science and medicine, not scientific issues

677
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't really think that Robins

678
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't really think that Robinson was unhappy with Hicks' performance

679
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and maybe Hicks had not done some things that Robins

680
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and expected him to do or it asked him to do

681
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
they also had very different personalities

682
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and they could have been a bit of a personality clash there as well

683
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So how did the legal ring link play out?

684
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The legal ring link play out?

685
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It was a multi-year affair, it was very distracting

686
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
to all involve very expensive proposition

687
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
there were lots of suits, of course at that time

688
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I didn't really involve myself with any of that

689
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
because I had no administrative functions

690
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I was just happy doing my research

691
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
not worrying about what was going on

692
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
in the legal realm

693
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
or the administrative hierarchy of the institute

694
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
but I'm looking back at these documents retrospectively

695
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and clear that people were completely subsumed

696
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
with these legal issues

697
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
because when these kinds of charges are made and suits are filed

698
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you really have to do the best you can to protect the organization

699
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and that means hiring good attorneys

700
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and getting into the details of all the issues

701
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and countless depositions and document analyses

702
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and it's all very tedious and very expensive

703
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
In a way it's also quite fascinating

704
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
because jurisprudence is a very interesting game

705
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
legal game that gets played

706
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and it's interesting to see how the strategies evolve

707
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and how the players behave

708
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but it can be incredibly distracting

709
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
if your main goal is to carry out research

710
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and I think it was very distracting for everybody involved

711
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and art ended up suing his attorneys

712
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because he was unhappy with the settlement

713
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
that had eventually been reached

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and sometime much later

715
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think between the time I became chief executive officer

716
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and Linus Pong's death

717
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Art Robinson reemerged from the past

718
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and really I had nothing to do with him

719
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and hadn't heard from him or about him for many, many years

720
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
because after the settlement in the early 1980s

721
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that was the end of the legal entanglement

722
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
with our Robinson I knew that he had moved to Oregon

723
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to cave junction and set up his own research organization

724
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that wasn't quite sure exactly what he was doing

725
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
this was long before the internet of course

726
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and it was difficult to fared out details about

727
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
because activities unlike today

728
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
so I really had no reason to think about our Robinson

729
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
until I got a phone call or a letter

730
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
actually it was a letter I believe

731
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
asked to Linus Pong from Art that Pong turned over to me

732
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that was a request for access to research data

733
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
that Art had generated at the Institute

734
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
before his departure

735
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
so Art described this research data

736
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
as being many filing the five

737
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
the steel case five drawer filing cabinets

738
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
maybe ten or fifteen of those

739
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
worth of hard copy paper records

740
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that were generated as a result of the metabolic

741
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
profiling program

742
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and also very large magnetic data tapes

743
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that were maybe a foot in diameter

744
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and at the time without going back and actually looking

745
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
at the terms of the settlement

746
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
which of course stipulated that none of that had to be given to our Robinson

747
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and he had already been given an opportunity to copy

748
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
his research data

749
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
albeit at high cost

750
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
before he left the Institute he declined to do so at that time

751
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but I thought all these years had gone by

752
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
there was really nothing to be gained

753
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and withholding anything from Art Robinson

754
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and if he was able to

755
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
if he was able to translate this raw data

756
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
into scientific publications

757
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that would be scientifically or medically valuable

758
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I was in favor of that

759
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
so I decided to look around and see

760
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
what I could find that was

761
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that resembled what he'd asked for

762
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and in looking around the Institute

763
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I could find nothing

764
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that resembled the volume of material that he had requested

765
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
there weren't boxes and boxes

766
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
or many filing cabinets full of data

767
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
there weren't dozens or hundreds of magnetic data tapes

768
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
these things just didn't exist within the building

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
so I queried a number of people including

770
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Dick Willoughby who was our facility's manager

771
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and he was at the Institute at that time

772
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and a number of other people who I thought

773
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
might have had some knowledge of the whereabouts of this material over time

774
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
no one really seemed to have a clear idea of what had happened to it

775
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
but I reconstructed what I believe to be

776
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
its disposition and I sent this and a letter

777
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Robinson, what I considered a very collegial cordial letter

778
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I mean it was unhappy news for Robinson

779
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but nevertheless it was as far as I knew

780
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and as far as I still know the truth

781
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
about the disposition of this material

782
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the Institute had a satellite facility

783
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
on Porter Drive in Stanford, Industrial Park

784
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and that satellite facility was used for

785
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sussacala aging research

786
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
that was carried out by Jim Fleming and others

787
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
also in the 1980s we had carried out some work

788
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
on fabricating superconductive material

789
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
to support one of Pauling's patent application,

790
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Stella Kerman and to some extent you and Cameron

791
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and I worked on that project

792
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and we also used a number of rooms there for paper storage

793
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and we'd had problems with the roof leaking in that facility

794
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that actually led to a lawsuit with a landlord

795
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and a lot of the paper that had been stored in that facility

796
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
was ruined because the leak of the roof leaked

797
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and the paper was damaged by water

798
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and I believe there was just thrown out

799
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and because it was damaged there wasn't any attempt

800
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
made to really examine it carefully

801
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm reconstructing that, I don't know that for sure

802
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
but I do know because I did see it with my own eyes

803
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
a lot of destroyed records

804
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
by water

805
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and then I gave that as what I considered

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
a reasonable explanation of what had happened

807
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
to our research material

808
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
my understanding was that it had been stored up there

809
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
because there wasn't any room to really keep it

810
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
in the 440 page mill road facility

811
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
if indeed it had been kept that long

812
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
it was a quarter drive and probably destroyed by water

813
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
from a leaking roof

814
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
that as I said led to litigation with a landlord

815
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because the landlord wasn't quick

816
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
in repairing the roof unfortunately

817
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
so art did not take that news very well

818
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and in a way I can sympathize with it

819
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because that work represented a significant

820
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
percent of his life's work at that time

821
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
but that's the way it is

822
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the material was gone

823
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
it was probably destroyed, probably damaged

824
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and there was nothing to give him

825
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
but he was unwilling to accept that explanation

826
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and believed for whatever reason very obscured me

827
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that I must be hiding this material

828
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
or lying to him

829
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
mischaracterizing everything

830
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and I tried to think about what is motivation

831
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
for believing that I would do that

832
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and I just could not come up with a sensible motivation

833
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think that he played so much emphasis

834
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
on the importance of this material

835
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
that it was beyond comprehension

836
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
to him that it could have been thrown away

837
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
even having been damaged

838
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
so he was unwilling to accept that explanation

839
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and that led to kind of a proxy lawsuit

840
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
against the Institute by a colleague of his Jane Orient

841
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
who I think is associated with him

842
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and kind of libertarian politics

843
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and she's a physician in Arizona

844
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
at least at the time

845
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
who had made rather strategically

846
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I believe a small donation to the Institute

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and then later wanted access to research records

848
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and she called me on the telephone

849
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and I had a nice conversation with her

850
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and she was asking about research

851
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and at first I was confused

852
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I thought she was talking about the protein profiling work

853
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and then I realized she was talking about the metabolic profiling work

854
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and I talked about some of the work

855
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that had been ongoing until the mid 1980s and so forth

856
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
the development of the apparatus

857
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and data collection and analysis

858
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and loss of funding and so forth

859
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and then it became clear that what she was really interested in

860
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
was this old art Robinson material

861
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and I think at the time I told her

862
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the same thing I told her

863
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
which is I don't know what happened to it

864
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
we don't have it

865
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
so I can't offer it to you

866
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
so that led to a suit that she filed

867
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
against the Institute for access

868
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
to this publicly financed research data

869
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and that of course involved a lot of time

870
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and energy and resources

871
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
but eventually it was dismissed by the court

872
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
for lack of standing, essentially

873
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Do you have a sense of what's in your range

874
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
or the reconciliation involved in the following report?

875
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Well I think art's letter to Linus Pauling

876
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and Linus Pauling's response to him

877
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
if there was a response was cordial

878
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Art's letter was pretty cordial

879
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know that they communicated much

880
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
from the time the lawsuit finished

881
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
until that letter in the early 1990s

882
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
my guess is they probably did not

883
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
because art really in many occasions

884
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
have lots of bad things to say about the Institute

885
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and Linus Pauling

886
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
so I can't imagine that they really communicated much

887
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and I don't know that that was art's attempted reconciliation

888
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
or whether he viewed that opportunity

889
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
of me being in charge in the Institute now

890
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and Pauling gradually expiring

891
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
as an opportunity to get access

892
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
to research data that he thought we've been sitting on

893
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
all those years.

894
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Okay, well let's switch to you

895
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and everyone.

896
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
He read from 1978

897
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
perhaps in the full time

898
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but he was a wonderful person.

899
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He was very charming.

900
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
He had a great sense of humor.

901
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
He also had the Scottish broke

902
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and was shy, I think.

903
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He didn't like to talk in public

904
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and it sometimes was hard to understand what he was saying

905
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
because of his accent and a tendency

906
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
to mumble sometimes.

907
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But he was very intelligent, very compassionate.

908
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Clearly a research minded physician

909
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
who was interested in finding new ways

910
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to help his patients live with cancer.

911
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I think he and Pauling initially

912
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
thought that vitamin C might

913
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
might be able to turn cancer into a manageable disease.

914
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A chronic disease rather than something

915
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that would kill you in short order

916
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and that led him to consider vitamin C as

917
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
having potential value and treating cancer patients.

918
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I really enjoyed him.

919
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I would go to parties with him quite often.

920
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
He loved to drink single malt scotch

921
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
which he would bring from every time he went

922
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to Scotland and came back.

923
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
He would always have a seem like an arm load

924
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
of single malt scotchers for everyone to try.

925
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And he liked his mugs cigarettes too

926
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
which was a bit ironic.

927
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Sometimes it's the old do as I say

928
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that not as I do motif that you see

929
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
sometimes with physicians or other people.

930
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Cameron was not pious.

931
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
He didn't preach to people about

932
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
what they should or shouldn't do.

933
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And he was well aware of his own

934
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
bad habit of smoking.

935
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It was hard to reconcile with his

936
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
career as a cancer surgeon

937
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
removing disease lungs

938
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and other tissue from patients.

939
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Nevertheless, he found it very difficult to quit.

940
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I know he tried to quit smoking

941
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
in a number of times but didn't succeed.

942
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So I kind of, I think I kind of liked him

943
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
because he had some weaknesses as well

944
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
but he was extremely bright

945
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and very compassionate person.

946
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And he party settings.

947
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
He was a more thoughtful person.

948
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
He party settings. He was more social.

949
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah, he was very social.

950
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Very, very social.

951
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
My girlfriend and I loved to hear him tell tales

952
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
about his work in Burma.

953
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I remember one story he told about

954
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
lancing a boil on an elephant

955
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
which was quite extraordinary.

956
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And he told me about some of the

957
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
therapy available to the cohort of

958
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
cancer patients that he was treating

959
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
which was called Brompton's Cocktail

960
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
which was a mixture of

961
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I believe alcohol, cocaine, and heroin

962
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
that's got its surgeons and physicians

963
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
very freely gave to their terminal cancer

964
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
patients because they weren't concerned

965
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
about these people becoming drug addicts.

966
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They just wanted to make their

967
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
end of their lives as comfortable

968
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and pain-free as possible.

969
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
The following ever coming

970
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
on camera to you

971
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and is a personal feeling for some of these professional

972
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
feelings.

973
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Pauling really liked you and Cameron.

974
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think he had a very deep feeling for you and Cameron

975
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and despite the fact that Cameron smoked

976
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Pauling was apparently willing to completely

977
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
overlook that.

978
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And Pauling felt very strongly about smoking.

979
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I remember seeing letters that were unopened

980
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in Dorothy Monroe's office

981
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
because they smelled of cigarette smoke

982
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and Pauling refused to handle them.

983
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So that didn't seem to bother him so much

984
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
about you and Cameron though and they were

985
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
they were a great colleagues.

986
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I think they enjoyed each other's company quite a lot

987
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and Cameron regaled us with stories

988
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
my girlfriend and I about to

989
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Pauling's first visit to Scotland.

990
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I didn't mention this in the last talk today.

991
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The toilets, did I mention that?

992
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah.

993
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So Cameron was very down to Earth

994
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and very much aware of Pauling's reputation

995
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and stature in the scientific field too.

996
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So Cameron himself was a little bit

997
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
in awe of Pauling but Cameron had

998
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
medical knowledge of course that Pauling

999
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
didn't so they provided kind of a nice

1000
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
complementary relationship for each other I think.

1001
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And I think as a result of working

1002
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
with Cameron for so long, Pauling became

1003
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
even more medically minded.

1004
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And I know that Abram Hoffer,

1005
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
another of Pauling's old friends who initially

1006
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
got him interested in nice and

1007
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and Northam molecular psychiatry

1008
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
back in early 1960s, told me that he had been working

1009
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
hard towards the end of Pauling's life

1010
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
to get him an honorary medical degree

1011
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
which apparently is possible in Canada

1012
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
being part of the United Kingdom.

1013
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You can appeal to the Archbishop of Cancerbury

1014
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I believe through the Duke of Winds

1015
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
or something like that to get a medical degree

1016
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
conferred upon someone.

1017
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Of course, it wouldn't allow them to practice medicine

1018
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but it was a very prestigious honor

1019
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
and Hoffer was working

1020
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
those channels because he knew the English royalty

1021
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that would do it help him with this process

1022
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
but then he dropped it once Pauling died of course.

1023
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I like Cameron's family.

1024
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I did.

1025
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It did not meet Cameron's first wife,

1026
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
a new Connie Cameron, his second wife quite well

1027
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
because she had been working for Rick Hicks at the Institute

1028
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and that's how you and Cameron got to know her

1029
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
through his visits and tenure

1030
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
at the Linus Pauling Institute and she also

1031
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
a very charming, very funny, attractive person.

1032
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You and had a son and a daughter

1033
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and he was always a bit concerned about his son

1034
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
because his son seemed to be having a bit of a hard time

1035
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
being independent, finding a career,

1036
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
being happy with his life and so forth.

1037
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You and was also conflicted a bit

1038
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
in taking the position at the Institute in California

1039
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
because it would take him away from his children

1040
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and he was concerned that his children still needed some guidance.

1041
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But I met his children, they were very nice people,

1042
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
very affable, very intelligent,

1043
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
very curious people.

1044
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
So how did Cameron's research program

1045
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
of all over the course of this time of institute?

1046
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, I would say when he was physically

1047
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
at the Institute, he of course was not

1048
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
treating patients in Scotland

1049
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but he was continuing to collect and analyze data

1050
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
from those cancer cases in Scotland

1051
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and continuing to work with

1052
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
people who were doing that for him in Scotland

1053
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
developing ways of analyzing the data,

1054
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
automated data collections, programs and things

1055
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
of that nature.

1056
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So he was very involved in that while he was at the Institute.

1057
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
He also became increasingly involved in

1058
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
what today is called Outreach

1059
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
or public education.

1060
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And as the work with Cameron and Pauling

1061
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
on Vitamin C and Cancer became more well known,

1062
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
there were many queries from the public,

1063
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
particularly patients afflicted with cancer,

1064
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
who wanted advice.

1065
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
How much vitamin C should I take?

1066
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Where can I go to get it and so on and so forth?

1067
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
There had been a clinic operating at the Institute

1068
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
on San Hill Road for a very short period

1069
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but it became overburden by poor patients

1070
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
very quickly.

1071
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So that was a band and that was set up by John Catchpool.

1072
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And like I said, didn't last very long.

1073
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So we were struggling at the time

1074
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
between giving sensible, practical and non-medical

1075
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
advice to people because Cameron wasn't licensed

1076
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
to practice medicine in the United States

1077
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
so he couldn't give medical advice to people.

1078
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So we had to be a bit oblique about it

1079
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and provide patients and their physicians with research papers

1080
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and a mood to responses of other similar patients

1081
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
to a certain course of therapy and so forth.

1082
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So Cameron was working very hard

1083
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
to kind of perfect our strategy of responding

1084
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
to the public for these health related questions

1085
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
so that we didn't incur legal liability

1086
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
but we were acting ethically and morally

1087
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and trying to be good citizens and compassionate

1088
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
because many of the people who contacted the Institute

1089
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and those days were in dire straits.

1090
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
These were people for whom traditional conventional therapy

1091
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
was not successful and they were just waiting to die

1092
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and they weren't willing to accept that fate

1093
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
so they were turning to other modalities

1094
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
which included things like vitamin C

1095
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and once they started to consider that naturally

1096
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the tendency was to get in touch with the Institute

1097
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and talk to you and Cameron.

1098
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So he spent an enormous amount of time on the phone

1099
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and writing letters to cancer patients

1100
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and had the people of questions about vitamin C.

1101
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Well Cameron and Pauline's research on cancer

1102
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
attracted the great deal of criticism

1103
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that you have a sense of how they respond back and finally.

1104
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah, I think they felt

1105
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and this has been written about many times

1106
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and I think you can infer their emotions

1107
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
from some of the letters that appeared in journals and elsewhere

1108
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
that they had been treated badly

1109
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
by the male clinic

1110
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and both Cameron and Pauline were astonished

1111
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
to find out and angry

1112
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
that the male clinic researchers Craig and Mortel

1113
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
had never even read Cameron's papers, relevant papers.

1114
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So they ostensibly were charged by the NCI

1115
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
with replicating Cameron's work

1116
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
yet they knew virtually nothing about it

1117
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and had they read Cameron's papers

1118
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
they may have noticed that Cameron was giving high dose

1119
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
vitamin C both orally and intravenously

1120
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and that, as it turns out, may have been a very crucial feature

1121
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
that was completely ignored by them

1122
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because they perhaps had too much hubris

1123
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
to read this Scottish surgeon's papers

1124
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
on vitamin C and cancer.

1125
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And I think the fact that the studies were published

1126
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
without the courtesy of showing the study

1127
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
before publication to Pauline and Cameron

1128
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
did not sit well with them

1129
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
because once the study was published

1130
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
immediately the media wants responses

1131
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
the same day

1132
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and it put you in an awkward position

1133
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
because Cameron and Pauline had that a time

1134
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
to read the study and think about it carefully

1135
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
and come up with a cogent analysis

1136
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and critique of it

1137
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
so they were angered by that

1138
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
as well because they felt that professional courtesy

1139
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
was not extended to them in that regard

1140
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
and they felt that the work that the Mayo Clinic had done

1141
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
was to use Pauline's word somewhat fraudulent

1142
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and they were worried that this would end

1143
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
serious consideration of vitamin C

1144
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
as injunctive therapy for cancer

1145
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and they felt that that would be unethical

1146
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and immoral

1147
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and unscientific and ill conceived

1148
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
so they were upset

1149
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and it was clear that they were upset

1150
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and Cameron neither Cameron nor Pauline were

1151
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
they didn't reveal anger

1152
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
they didn't shout or break things or storm around

1153
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
or anything like that

1154
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
but voices were raised definitely

1155
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and Cameron was not very pleased

1156
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
by the work that had been done at the Mayo Clinic

1157
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
it showed

1158
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think everyone was unhappy and angry as well

1159
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I think everyone shared the anger

1160
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
that the studies had been published

1161
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and they weren't carefully done

1162
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and there seemed to be lots of problems with them

1163
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that they didn't replicate Cameron's protocol

1164
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
as they reportedly did

1165
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and I think there was also concern

1166
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
among the fundraising staff that this might

1167
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
build ill for continuing efforts

1168
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
to raise money to support research at the Institute

1169
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
and sure enough, there were some fundraising problems

1170
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
after that work was published

1171
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
so it had a big impact on our work

1172
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
at the Institute

1173
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
as well as sort of shelving

1174
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
serious consideration of vitamin C and cancer

1175
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
for many, many years

1176
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
which I think was a real disservice

1177
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
to the research community

1178
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
and to the huge population of cancer patients

1179
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
out there who might have benefited from this

1180
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
had the research been done more carefully

1181
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
early on

1182
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
but was that

1183
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I believe in the site

1184
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and believe in the idea

1185
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
yes

1186
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and I think partly because the arguments

1187
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
that both Cameron and Pauline

1188
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
loved against male clinic researchers

1189
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
were very cogent and sensible

1190
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
they weren't just

1191
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you know, fringe arguments that had no validity

1192
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so they were valid arguments

1193
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and I think everyone was well aware of them

1194
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
in Cameron I think

1195
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Cameron made

1196
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I think he said one time

1197
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
at first he thought they were just dealing with fools

1198
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and then he realized they were dealing with naves

1199
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
as he put it

1200
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
the mission very briefly

1201
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
in 1970

1202
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
the clinic

1203
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
or the cancer students

1204
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
at the clinic for diagnosing

1205
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and treating these in the hospital

1206
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and talking a little bit more about that

1207
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
well it predated my arrival

1208
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
at the Institute

1209
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
so I don't really have a lot of first-hand knowledge

1210
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
about the clinic

1211
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I know that

1212
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the concept there was

1213
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
was clear

1214
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
that some people might benefit

1215
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
from Orthodox and medical treatment

1216
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
but I think the funding

1217
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and liability issues were

1218
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
the funding was too low

1219
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and the liability issues were too

1220
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
great

1221
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
to really

1222
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
turn that into a practical

1223
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
functional concern

1224
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and I do remember

1225
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Korean Gorem and others telling me

1226
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
that there were people who showed up

1227
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
knocking on the door

1228
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
definitely ill

1229
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and spent their last money on a bus ticket

1230
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
to get there

1231
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and no money and expected to be cured

1232
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and that was not uncommon

1233
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and that of course just was not possible

1234
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
so I think rather than

1235
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
risk having the tailwag

1236
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
the dog

1237
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
they decided to dissolve the clinic

1238
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
rather quickly

1239
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
it was located within the building

1240
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
as I understand

1241
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Frank has pool was part of that

1242
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Frank catch pool was part of that

1243
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and catch pool

1244
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I got to know often on

1245
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
because even when the clinic finished

1246
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
he was still loosely involved

1247
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
with the Institute from time to time

1248
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and I think he was practicing

1249
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
right up until the end of his life

1250
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
in Marine County

1251
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
maybe in Sossolido, California

1252
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and he really liked Pauling

1253
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and I think Pauling really liked him

1254
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
quite a lot as well

1255
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
he spoke at Pauling's memorial service

1256
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
at Stanford Church

1257
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Did you ever talk about his life

1258
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
but quite negative

1259
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I probably talked to him about his work in Africa

1260
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
of course where I think Pauling first was met him

1261
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Albert Schweizer's camp there

1262
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I can't remember those discussions

1263
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
very carefully now though

1264
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Well we talked about this kind of off the line

1265
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
throughout the interview

1266
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
but I'm wondering if you could be quite a little bit more

1267
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
than kind of the chronic funny problems

1268
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
in Kansas to face the very long time

1269
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah well the Institute was I think founded and moved

1270
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
off the campus of Stanford University

1271
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
initially because there wasn't enough money

1272
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Nor was there enough space

1273
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
at Stanford to carry out the work

1274
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
that Pauling really felt would make a big impact

1275
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and public health

1276
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
namely research and worth

1277
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
molecules of medicine

1278
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and specifically research on vitamin C

1279
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
and I think Pauling

1280
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
and Robinson felt that this had great potential

1281
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
as to metabolite profiling

1282
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
metabolic profiling program

1283
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So they moved they founded the Institute moved to the

1284
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
location that we've talked about in Menlo Park

1285
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and then said about trying to raise money

1286
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
to carry out this research

1287
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and government grants were not

1288
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
forthcoming for the vitamin C work

1289
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
although the metabolic profiling work

1290
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
was supported to a large extent

1291
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
by government grants in those days

1292
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
the development of the apparatus

1293
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
data analysis data collection

1294
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
sample collection things like that

1295
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and then as the Institute started to grow

1296
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
the need for more resources

1297
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
financial resources became pretty clear

1298
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and that's when Art Robinson

1299
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and Rick Hicks got involved in this direct mail

1300
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
solicitation program

1301
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
because they correctly perceived that the public

1302
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
had responded to Pauling's message

1303
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and thoughts about vitamin C and health

1304
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
much more quickly than the medical community

1305
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and scientific community so

1306
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
there were lots of people out there

1307
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
who believed that Pauling was right about vitamin C

1308
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
and wanted to sort of support the David versus the Goliath

1309
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Pauling versus the convention

1310
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and the conventional medical establishment

1311
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
so they were willing to give

1312
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
small and large donations

1313
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
to support research at the Institute

1314
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
so in a way that was very good

1315
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
because it allowed the Institute to hire staff scientists

1316
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
without tenure of course

1317
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
but hire them and provide them with money

1318
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
to carry out research

1319
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that was not dependent on government grants

1320
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
or corporate sponsorship

1321
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
although throughout the history of the Institute

1322
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
corporate sponsorship and contracts

1323
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
were quite variable

1324
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Hoffman, Mirose, gave money

1325
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
the Japan ship building industry foundation gave money

1326
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
so there were

1327
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
the record and organizational sources of funding

1328
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
but sometimes they were restricted

1329
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and sometimes they were non-restricted

1330
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
luckily the money from some of those large donors

1331
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
was unrestricted and to be applied

1332
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
across the board to support whatever line is Pauling

1333
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
art Robinson or Amyles who could kind of felt was important

1334
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but because of excuse me

1335
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
because of the stock market performance

1336
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
and the vagaries of the national economy over years

1337
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
that affected the ability of individuals

1338
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and to some extent corporations to give money

1339
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
it affected their philanthropic abilities

1340
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
so when there were down times during recessions

1341
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and other down times people gave less money

1342
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
nevertheless at the Institute

1343
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the costs were constant or increasing

1344
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
so in those times there was always a pinch

1345
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and that would often be resolved

1346
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
transiently by decreasing contributions

1347
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
to pension plans

1348
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
or salary reductions

1349
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
that were temporary

1350
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and they would be lifted

1351
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
once the economic picture brightened somewhat

1352
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
so it was always kind of a roller coaster

1353
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
depending upon what was going on in the national economy

1354
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
because when you're a charitable organization

1355
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
depending upon the philanthropy of others

1356
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the economic climate effects

1357
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
the ability to give

1358
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and we certainly were aware of that

1359
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
much later as I said when the male clinic studies

1360
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
on vitamin C and cancer were published

1361
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that also caused transient loss

1362
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
in funds available to me

1363
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
because people were giving less money

1364
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
because they felt now vitamin C had failed

1365
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
to show anything for why support that kind of research

1366
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and still later when people became aware

1367
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
of polling interest and work in HIV

1368
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
infection, AIDS, and vitamin C

1369
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
that also caused a transient loss

1370
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
in support because people were

1371
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
some people were opposed to that work on moral grounds

1372
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and didn't want to see that kind of research funded at the Institute

1373
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't think there were

1374
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and interestingly enough

1375
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
in the early 1990s

1376
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
John Levitt who had been the director

1377
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
of the molecular carcinogenesis laboratory

1378
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
calculated the impact factor for the institution

1379
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
so impact factors to be calculated

1380
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the journals they can be calculated for scientists

1381
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
they can also be calculated for institutions

1382
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and I believe the result of John's analysis

1383
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
at that time

1384
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
ranked the Institute in the top 15

1385
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
non-profit biomedical research institutes

1386
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
in the country

1387
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
on the basis of impact factor

1388
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and I should add that that was not all

1389
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
related to Linus Polling's productivity

1390
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
lots of papers from institute staff

1391
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
figured in the calculation of the impact factor

1392
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
so despite the fact that there were financial problems

1393
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
throughout the Institute's career

1394
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I think ultimately in terms of productivity

1395
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and influence I think it succeeded

1396
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
surprisingly well given the

1397
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
its size and lack of resources

1398
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
well we're at 65 minutes

1399
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
do you want to do more questions here?

1400
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
okay

1401
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
what time is it?

1402
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
it's 11.35

1403
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
yeah a couple more questions

1404
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
sound good

1405
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
so in 1980 the Institute moved

1406
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
in the middle of Part 440 page

1407
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and all of them

1408
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
well my understanding at the time

1409
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
was that the building

1410
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
owned by Tom Ford

1411
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
in which the Institute had been located

1412
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
was primarily an office building

1413
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
and it was on

1414
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
loosely packed

1415
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
sedimentary

1416
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
soils

1417
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and over time

1418
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
because earthquake activity

1419
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
related to the San Andreas Falls

1420
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
seismic activity in that whole area

1421
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
there had been some structural problems

1422
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
with the building

1423
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and I believe that the

1424
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
owner wanted

1425
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
to evict everyone

1426
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
to fix the building

1427
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
structurally

1428
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and probably did not want to invite the Linus

1429
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
to back because he could make

1430
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
much more money

1431
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
by renting

1432
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that space to

1433
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
paper companies

1434
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
or

1435
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
you know people who weren't doing lab research

1436
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and who's financial outlook

1437
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
was sometimes sketchy

1438
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
at best

1439
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
so that

1440
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
that precipitated a search

1441
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
by Institute administrators

1442
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Rick Hicks

1443
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and in the Institute

1444
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
of Contal in particular

1445
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
to find a facility

1446
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
in which the Institute

1447
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
got research

1448
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
which led them to this old battery factory

1449
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Cinderblock construction

1450
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
at 440 page mill road

1451
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that didn't require

1452
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
a great deal of renovation

1453
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
in order to accommodate the Institute's work

1454
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
there was some renovation

1455
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
in laboratories

1456
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
we had a class biological clean room

1457
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
that we had to

1458
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
design for large-scale

1459
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
rat

1460
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
mouse work

1461
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
of a variant

1462
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
where we were

1463
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
housing guinea pigs

1464
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and other animals

1465
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
for some vitamins

1466
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
research

1467
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
so

1468
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the move was made to that facility

1469
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and

1470
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
we were on very good terms with the new landlords

1471
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
who increased the rent

1472
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
only dependent on the

1473
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
CPI increase every year

1474
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
every couple years

1475
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
so

1476
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
they weren't

1477
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
out to make a killing

1478
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
by escalating the rent

1479
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
to the point

1480
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
where we would have to move

1481
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and they would get some other tenant

1482
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and they seem to have

1483
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
some feeling for the Institute's mission

1484
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and admiration for Lines Polling

1485
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and wanted to make it as

1486
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
easy as possible for the Institute

1487
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
to remain in that building

1488
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
so it sounds like

1489
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
in financial terms of this building

1490
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
that positive move

1491
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
mentioned in the space itself

1492
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
what we're doing

1493
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
well

1494
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
it was

1495
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
there was much more square footage

1496
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
available to us in this building

1497
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
the building itself

1498
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
was

1499
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
pretty shabby compared to the nice office building

1500
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
that we

1501
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
left

1502
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
in Memo Park

1503
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
as I said it was a

1504
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
cinder block construction

1505
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
kind of an ugly building

1506
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
really nothing to look at

1507
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
definitely not a showcase building

1508
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
but it was functional

1509
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and the offices were fine

1510
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
and we were able to carry out the scientific work

1511
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
so

1512
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
that was fine

1513
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it suited us at the time

1514
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and we moved

1515
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
everything ourselves

1516
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Alan Sheetz

1517
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
who was a biochemist working in the Institute

1518
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
his father

1519
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
had been a professional mover

1520
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
in Idaho

1521
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and Alan had spent

1522
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
a lot of his boyhood years

1523
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and college years

1524
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
to several jobs moving

1525
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
for his father's company

1526
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
so he really knew

1527
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
about moving equipment

1528
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and offices and laboratories

1529
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and so forth so Alan

1530
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
really

1531
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
coordinated our move

1532
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
from one facility to the other

1533
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and we rented a bunch of

1534
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
big trucks

1535
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and hand trucks

1536
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
and blankets

1537
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and all the other

1538
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
material that we needed to move

1539
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
and basically did it ourselves

1540
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I saved a lot of money

1541
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
for their

1542
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
special consideration

1543
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
that would suit the

1544
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
apparatus

1545
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
oh yeah

1546
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
yeah everything was moved

1547
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
very carefully of course

1548
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and we had to close

1549
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
the experimental work

1550
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and then

1551
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
locked down all the instruments

1552
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and it was a challenge to move

1553
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
some of these things

1554
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but nevertheless we did it

1555
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and vendors would come in

1556
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and recalibrate our

1557
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
diffusives and other equipment

1558
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
so managed to get it all done

1559
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and at the time we had quite a few

1560
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
reasonable young men on staff

1561
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
so we had quite a lot of muscle power

1562
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
at the time

1563
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and we could do this

1564
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and then can maybe do the Institute

1565
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to give up the first line of point

1566
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
level for humanitarian

1567
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
you comment on the background

1568
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
well of course at that time

1569
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I was not in administration

1570
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I was just in research

1571
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
so I didn't really have

1572
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
insight into the nature of this award

1573
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I mean I was aware of the awards

1574
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and the ceremonies and so forth

1575
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and the candidates also need to be

1576
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
uniformly deserving of the award

1577
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
but it always seemed to me to have

1578
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
a bit of a fundraising component to it

1579
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and I think probably if you asked

1580
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
the people who had set up

1581
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
these awards and the occasions

1582
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I think they would probably admit

1583
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
that there was a fundraising component

1584
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
what was the nature of the Montreal

1585
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
construction of the metro

1586
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
lateral

1587
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
again I'm not

1588
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I didn't have a lot of familiarity

1589
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
with that at the time

1590
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I know that Pauling

1591
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
believes that there may be some validity

1592
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
to

1593
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
lateral

1594
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
and he thought that

1595
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
there was enough biological

1596
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
plausibility that

1597
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
studies should be undertaken

1598
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I don't think he had a firm opinion

1599
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
that yes lateral

1600
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
is definitely valuable

1601
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and treating cancer

1602
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
but I think he was calling for more research

1603
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
to really get to the bottom

1604
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
or whether or not this was going to be useful

1605
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
in cancer therapy

1606
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I didn't other than that

1607
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I really was not

1608
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
to aware of the controversy at the time

1609
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
but that thing actually would have

1610
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
nothing to do with the investigation

1611
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
not that I can remember

1612
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
no

1613
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
One program that I got involved with

1614
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
just backtracking slightly with you and

1615
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Cameron of course

1616
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and maybe I talked about this earlier

1617
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I can't remember

1618
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Cameron was very interested in

1619
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
whether or not vitamin C would

1620
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
affect chemotherapy

1621
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
to drug activity in the body

1622
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and he was concerned

1623
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
that cancer patients who were taking

1624
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
chemotherapy to drugs

1625
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
that were designed to be effective

1626
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
in halting the spread of cancer

1627
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
or attacking the primary tumor

1628
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
he didn't want those people to take

1629
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
simultaneously high dose vitamin C

1630
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
if the vitamin C was going to neutralize

1631
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
the effectiveness of the chemotherapy

1632
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
of drugs because vitamin C has some general

1633
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
detoxifying capabilities

1634
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and it can interfere with certain drug action

1635
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
so he was very concerned about that

1636
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and he wasn't sure

1637
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
whether vitamin C would or would not

1638
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
affect chemotherapy of drugs

1639
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
so we set up an experiment

1640
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alan Sheets and I

1641
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
with you and Cameron and Len McPherson

1642
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
to look at the effect

1643
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
on fingerling trout

1644
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
of chemotherapy of drugs and vitamin C

1645
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
because you can monitor the movement of fish

1646
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
which relates to their physiology

1647
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and biochemical activity

1648
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and I guess how they're feeling as well

1649
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
so the idea was to measure fish movement

1650
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
in fish that had been exposed

1651
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
to drugs like methotrexate

1652
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
with and with that vitamin C

1653
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
to see if the vitamin C was interfering

1654
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
with the drug action and in the fish

1655
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The last thing I want to ask you about today

1656
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
is following relationship

1657
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
where she says the cellar

1658
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
so we talked about this foundation

1659
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and that means people in families

1660
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
and we, in my understanding today

1661
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
20 years ago

1662
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
something of the controversial figure

1663
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
that something we know is ever discussed

1664
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
between the Institute

1665
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
or the idea of vitamin H

1666
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
and this was fun

1667
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
and there was a close tie that it seems.

1668
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah.

1669
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I think some people were aware

1670
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
of Sussagalus controversial history in Japan.

1671
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I was aware that he

1672
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
made at least some fortune

1673
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
for motorboat racing in Japan

1674
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and that didn't really bother me much.

1675
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And that familiar with some of the other accusations

1676
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
levied against him at the time

1677
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
to be honest with you

1678
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I think that the magnitude of the gift

1679
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
from Sussagalus Foundation

1680
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
affected what we were able to do

1681
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
at the Institute so dramatically

1682
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
that I think most people either chose

1683
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
not to think too carefully about his history

1684
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and just accept the money

1685
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
which I believe was about $500,000 a year

1686
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
for 10 years.

1687
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
A lot of that focused on aging research

1688
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and we had a Sussagalus

1689
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
aging research laboratory set up

1690
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
that Porter Drive

1691
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and when Sussagalus and his entourage

1692
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
would visit the Institute

1693
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
it was always in a

1694
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
long line of black limousines

1695
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and many, many people in dark suits

1696
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
that would always accompany him.

1697
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
My casual observation seemed to be

1698
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
that he seemed to be a pretty

1699
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
important figure and very wealthy

1700
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and I didn't really know much about him.

1701
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I met him once

1702
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
and had some subsequent communication

1703
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
with his son

1704
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and other functionaries

1705
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
at the foundation much later.

1706
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But I didn't really,

1707
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I wasn't privy to any interactions

1708
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that took place between Pauling and Sussagalus.

1709
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Okay, thank you.
