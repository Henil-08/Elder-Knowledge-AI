1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Okay Steve, so as in the past, can I introduce yourself?

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Steve Lawson, we're in a conference room in Valley Library on the 11th of November

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
2011.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,320
So in our last session, we talked quite a bit about the Mayo Clinic controversy, and

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,640
I don't know what we need to go over the details of that again, but I'm interested in

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,400
knowing a little bit more about the response from what they needed to, especially if there

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:37,520
was a... there was ever a plan or an idea about developing a research program specifically

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,960
in response to the what the Mayo Clinic has said.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,400
I don't think that there was a plan to develop a research project in response to the Mayo Clinic

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
studies.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,920
Following in Cameron, and anyone else who was sympathetic to their position realized that

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,760
the studies purportedly done to replicate Cameron's work were very flawed, and as I mentioned

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,400
last time, Cameron and Paul and were angry that the New England Journal of Medicine, for instance,

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,160
did not publish critical letters in a timely fashion, and typically medical journals

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,040
will publish critical letters while the original clinical trial or study reported in that

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
journal.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,280
It's still fresh in people's minds, and I think Paul and actually invoked his lawyer

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,160
to contact Arnold Realman of the New England Journal of Medicine to find out what had happened

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,920
to the letters that had been submitted, because the etiquette is that when you submit a publication

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,280
or a letter to a journal for consideration, for publication in that journal, you can't submit

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,760
it elsewhere.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,880
So this kind of stymied the ability of Cameron and Pauling to air their grievances

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,560
about the Mayo Clinic studies in print in a journal, because they'd already submitted

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,200
really cogent responses and relevance him to be sitting on these for quite a long time.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I think finally they published something, but it was nearly a year after the original

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,120
study had been published, and letters are read, but they certainly don't attract the kind

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,560
of media interest that the original study attracted.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,200
So I think Cameron and Pauling felt that they needed to continue on showing that vitamin

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,960
see had value, because they were both convinced by this time that vitamin see had value

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,760
for many cancer patients.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
And Pauling was also becoming a little after the second Mayo Clinic trial.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,200
He had heard from Abram Hoffer, the Canadian psychiatrist who had stimulated his interest

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,240
in B vitamins and schizophrenia back in the early 1960s, were mid 1960s that Hoffer had

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,440
been treating cancer patients with high dose vitamin C given orally, as well as an expanded

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,160
treatment regimen that included B vitamins, fatty acids, zinc, and some other micronutrients.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,920
And these cancer patients seem to be doing quite well.

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
So Pauling encouraged Hoffer to collect that data with the intent of analyzing it and

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
then publishing it.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
And they did that.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,560
They published two papers in the journal of worth of molecular medicine on Hoffer's

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
observation.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,400
So I think that this was not a response to the Mayo Clinic trials per se, but a continuation

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,440
of Pauling's deep interest in vitamin C and cancer.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,000
And Hoffer has been, Hoffer is an MD PhD psychiatrist by training in profession.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
And you might wonder why he was treating cancer patients.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, it turns out that many cancer patients, especially when given a diagnosis of prognosis

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,160
of terminal cancer, develop psychological problems, depression, anxiety, whatnot, and they

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,880
were being referred to Hoffer by oncologists in Vancouver and Victoria and British Columbia

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:07,200
to treat these mental manifestations that accompany the bad news about the cancer diagnosis.

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,920
So Hoffer began treating these people for mental health issues and kind of serendipitously

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
observed that they were living much longer in many cases than they were expected to live

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,080
by their oncologists.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,000
And he brought that observation to Pauling and encouraged him than to collect the data.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,600
So Cameron and Pauling continued to be very interested in vitamin C and cancer.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,640
Cameron, I think, was a bit discouraged by the political implications of this whole

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,400
and brawlial at the Mayo Clinic, and I think he became very frustrated and discouraged.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
And his attention was also turned elsewhere.

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
He was very interested in fatty acids and cancer and had set up a project at the Institute

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,240
to study the effect of oral fats in animals in a tumor model.

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
And he was also becoming more and more interested in AIDS.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,480
In the potential value of high dose vitamin C in treating AIDS patients.

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,200
And as you know, he and Pauling worked on a book together that absorbed quite a lot of

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Cameron's time and attention in those last years, which was never published.

64
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Cameron, I believe, had known or new of David Horvins work in England.

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,960
And then Horvins had written a book on Omega-3 fatty acids.

66
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,480
He was a researcher and I believe he was also a clinician who was very interested in the

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,600
health sort of the orthomolecular approach to health using fatty acids and other micronutrients.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,640
But he was particularly interested in fatty acids and brain function.

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:03,920
And Horvins, when I saw him at some point in the 1980s or early 1990s, had reported on a clinical trial,

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,240
preliminary clinical trial done in England with, I believe, schizophrenics who were given fatty

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:17,120
acid supplementation and MRIs or computer tomography had been done of their brains.

72
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,160
And they found that the ventricular spaces shrunk as a result of ingestion in these fatty acids

73
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,040
over a period of time, which also correlated with some symptomatic improvement.

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,960
So Horvins and Cameron, I think, too were become very interested in the psychiatric application of fatty acids.

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,840
And then, from epidemiological studies and rodent studies, it's been known for a long time that

76
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,440
Omega-6 fatty acids, polyensaturated fatty acids, may augment tumor development in some

77
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,000
rodent models. And there may be a protective effect by Omega-3 fats. So I think Cameron was

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,760
interested in teasing apart those effects of different types of fatty acids in a mouse model.

79
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,440
And that's an experiment that was set up at the Institute.

80
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,040
Yes. In 1986, how to live longer and feel better is published? Is this something that the

81
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Omega-7 was part of at all, or is this entirely a calling project into himself?

82
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,200
Excuse me, Dorothy Monroe, of course, helped him with that because she was his secretary and

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,800
she worked a lot on that book. And I think he had helped perhaps from Fred Stitt, maybe some other

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
people at the Institute, but it wasn't an Institute wide effort. It was done by Linus Pauling.

85
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
I think so, a German probably helped him in getting references and things of that nature too.

86
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,320
But as far as I know, Pauling himself produced the draft. And I believe he shared that

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,920
probably with some people, including Fred Stitt, for proofreading and suggestions and so forth.

88
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,760
But I think it was largely his project. And he directed that the royalties from that book

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,040
come to the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine because he undertook the book as an

90
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,320
employee of the Linus Pauling Institute. It wasn't something he was doing on his own

91
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,840
for financial gain. He really wanted that money to come to the Institute to support research.

92
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,240
What sort of reaction did you know in response to the book of people that were getting a

93
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,320
whole of the Institute? Well, there seemed to be a lot of interest in the book.

94
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
The original hardcover was published by WH Freeman. That wasn't around long.

95
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,280
Then there was a paperback, also published by Freeman, that was a

96
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,800
what you call a trade paperback. It was larger than a regular pocketbook paperback.

97
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,600
And that seemed to sell very well in addition. And then shortly after the Freeman

98
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,320
editions, the mass market paperback rights were auctioned, and Avon was the successful bidder.

99
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,360
I think it was a best seller for Avon as well, and went through many, many, many

100
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
so people really responded to the book. I think it was in the New York Times best seller list

101
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,800
for a while. I'm not sure what the rank was or for how long, but it sold very, very well.

102
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,520
And I don't think that the main impact was financial revenue for the Institute to carry out research,

103
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,760
but more of an awareness of Pauling's ideas and orthomolecular medicine. In the fact that a lot of

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,440
this research was going on in California at the Linus Pauling Institute. So it definitely directed

105
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,360
attention to the Institute, but of course this was before the internet. So people reading the book

106
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,520
and wanting to learn more about the possible impact of vitamin C and other vitamins and nutritional

107
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,520
essential minerals and so forth on cognitive function or health prevention and treatment of cardiovascular

108
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,320
disease and cancer and so forth would typically call or write to the Institute. And that of course

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:05,600
resulted in a huge enterprise because we didn't have very many staff to deal with all these letters

110
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,160
that would come in. And you and Cameron who had been non-resident fellow in the Institute,

111
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,720
I think moved to California to take up position as medical director maybe around 1984, 1985,

112
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,920
somewhere in that mid-1980 period. And as I said earlier, a lot of his effort was directed at responding

113
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
to these letters and phone calls from people with medical problems who wanted to know about the

114
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,120
purative therapeutic value of micronutrients, especially vitamin C. Fred Stitt also helped in that

115
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,920
area quite a lot. Fred had joined the Institute as a volunteer in the early 1980s. He had known

116
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,960
Pauline at Caltech and was actually thanked in Pauline's book on the chemical bond,

117
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,040
nature of the chemical bond. So he and Pauline had had a long relationship. Fred was retired and

118
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,440
had an office at the Institute and Fred became the newsletter editor and also helped develop some

119
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,960
standardized information packets that the Institute could send out to people who had,

120
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,640
because at that point the volume of mail and requests was so large that oftentimes these things

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,920
couldn't be handled on a personal basis because there was just overwhelming. Some of the questions

122
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,080
were very peculiar or idiosyncratic and required a little bit of work to answer a little

123
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,800
research to find out what the appropriate response would be. Some other questions were a little

124
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,160
more generic in these information packets were designed and made to answer those more generic

125
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
questions. And Fred was heavily involved in that putting together these different generic packets

126
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,560
that could go out to people. So he vetted that mail for the most part. Fred and new in

127
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Cameron and Dorothy Monroe. I think Carol Bastilleier had been doing this at Sandhill Road

128
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,920
Facility and I don't think that she was still part of the Institute in the 1980s when we moved to the

129
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,400
Page Mill Road Facility. But she had been doing a lot of that in Sandhill Road and actually

130
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,200
she'd identified quite a few issues. I think that were very important for people to think about,

131
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:29,280
especially with respect to liability trying not to provide medical advice, but being compassionate

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,440
and being helpful with people, but also not trying to tell them what to do medically because of course

133
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
we couldn't do anything like that. And Carol struggled with a lot of those issues and sort of

134
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,760
laid the groundwork for a successful strategy for answering these kinds of questions.

135
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Yeah. Well, I think he enjoyed it. He definitely was interested in research, but he really

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,280
was a patient-oriented doctor and he would have been a terrific doctor to have for personal care

137
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,040
because he was very compassionate. He was a good listener and he was not at all afflicted by

138
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,280
the kind of arrogant or rushed attitude that you find in many contemporary physicians

139
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
just because the insurance reimbursement for physicians can be

140
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,120
conductate how medical practice is actually done in this country and doctors aren't allowed to

141
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,800
spend much time with patients. Cameron was not like that at all. He was much more old school

142
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,680
and really like to listen to people in their problems and then think about what the appropriate

143
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
treatment a response would be. So I think that responding to the public

144
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,760
who brought these health questions or concerns to the Institute, I think he enjoyed that.

145
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,560
So in 1987 we mentioned this a little bit already but the vitamin C and a AIDS research

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,400
starts to make it a little bit longer if you could describe what that research was.

147
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,080
Yeah, to the best of my recollection,

148
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,760
Rexie Gerrwell had come to the Institute from Johns Hopkins and I believe he knew

149
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,520
John Levitt at Johns Hopkins as well. John Levitt had joined the Institute to direct our molecular

150
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,720
carcinogenesis program which again really didn't have anything to do with orthomolecular medicine.

151
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:41,600
It was more looking at, as I said molecular carcinogenesis, how genes and certain proteins can

152
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,960
be involved in the development of the cancer phenotype. He was particularly interested in a mutant

153
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,800
beta act in which seemed to be a reliable marker for many types of human cancer and used

154
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,120
protein profiling extensively to do quantitative and qualitative studies of these gene products

155
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,280
that seemed to correlate with cancer. So Rexie was a virologist and he set up the laboratory

156
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:15,920
for viral carcinogenesis because his initial interest was in, set him a galo viral carcinogenesis

157
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,480
and carcinogenesis due to herpes virus type 2 infection because it was known at the time that

158
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,680
infection with HSV2 increased the risk for certain types of gynecologic cancers in women.

159
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm not sure that it's related to any cancer increased cancer risk for men but there was an

160
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,200
increased cancer risk for women and I worked with him to some degree in that program we were looking

161
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:50,800
at small fragments of herpes virus type 2 DNA that were sufficient to cause transformation of

162
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,200
rat cells. So we would grow rat 2 cells which are quasi-normal cells in culture and then

163
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,040
transfect them with these small viral fragments from herpes virus type 2 and look to see if there

164
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,120
weren't any observable changes in these rat cells and we found the PST 2 or 3 C segment was sufficient

165
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,320
to cause the rat 2 cells to become overt tumor forming cells when injected into animals.

166
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,880
We also did a lot of protein profile. I had expertise in protein profiling at that time and

167
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,200
Raxeat really didn't so that was what I brought to his project and together we also worked

168
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:39,840
on a program that was supported by a philanthropist from Long Island, New York on fightic acid

169
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,400
which is found in seeds. It's an antioxidant that protects seeds from oxidation because seeds

170
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,080
need to store their genetic program very carefully and be free from oxidative damage while they're

171
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,480
waiting to germinate until the conditions are right for germination. So fightic acid plays a very

172
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,480
important role in protecting the seed genome and this fellow in New York had decided that it may

173
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,920
have some anti-cancer effects. So we were testing the anti-cancer effect of fightic acid in

174
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,560
Syrian hamster embryo cells and a number of other tumor cell lines. I was doing a lot of that

175
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,680
work, the cell culture worked and that generated a few papers including papers that showed that

176
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,480
fightic acids seem to affect cholesterol levels in animals and triglyceride levels in particular

177
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:39,200
and also could inhibit metal induced carcinogenesis in animals. We had a patent awarded for that

178
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,480
particular work. So Rexie was pretty well versed in cell culture and biology and carcinogenesis

179
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,720
and of course in the 1980s being close to San Francisco everyone was well aware of this new

180
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:03,280
syndrome that was primarily affecting male homosexuals although there seemed to be I think at that time

181
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,960
some incidents in hemophiliax too who were undergoing blood transfusions but the ideological agent

182
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,680
responsible for this age AIDS related. I can't remember exactly what the C stands for in that but

183
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,760
it was a syndrome that preceded over AIDS so people would of course wasn't known that HIV was

184
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,840
responsible for AIDS at that time. So there's a lot of concern about AIDS,

185
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,440
ARC and how infectious this disease might be and there were there was a lot of emphasis on things

186
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,480
like drug use and sex habits by male homosexuals that may contribute to immunodeficiency so

187
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,560
people weren't sure if it was a behavior, ideology or whether there was some kind of pathogen involved

188
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,520
and over time of course the 1980s it became clear from Monteniers' work in France and also

189
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,760
gallows work in the United States that aha there is actually an infectious agent here of virus

190
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:15,920
that's probably responsible for causing AIDS and then cells were available that were infected with

191
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:23,360
this virus HIV and we did and we're actually did a lot of work with Steve Harricke who was from

192
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,760
Lebanon, and Linus Pauling looking at the effect of vitamin C added to the culture medium

193
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,400
in which telymphocytes infected with HIV were grown so they wanted to find out whether

194
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,960
vitamin C would have any effect on viability of the virus or replication of the virus

195
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,640
and they found that it really affected viral replication very potently dramatically inhibited viral

196
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,560
replication and that was assayed by amounts of reverse transcriptase and also the formation of

197
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:07,360
Sincissia which are abnormal cells that are sort of pathologic correlates of telymphocytes infection

198
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,360
so that led to a paper that was published in PNAS with the three of them as authors I think Pauling

199
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,960
was a senior author in Gerroelle was perhaps the first author and that paper presented the results

200
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,200
of the cell culture experiments wasn't any clinical data but they suggested that this might

201
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,680
provide a promising approach for the treatment of AIDS namely by that time AZT had been

202
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,240
come available too for treatment of AIDS patients. AZT is pretty effective at inhibiting

203
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,320
the denoval infection of uninfected cells so you give AZD to patients and you preserve

204
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,080
those uninfected cells from becoming infected with the virus so vitamin C prevents viral

205
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,360
replication so the idea was that if you give AZT and vitamin C then you're inhibiting viral

206
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,280
replication and you're protecting if there is a little bit of viral replication you're also

207
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
inhibiting those new cells from becoming infected so the idea was that this might really

208
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,440
if it didn't eradicate the virus and kill the cells they were infected with the virus at least it

209
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:20,640
could could cause AIDS to become a manageable disease perhaps so yeah well are you carrying

210
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,480
involved well I think Cameron got involved because obviously there are medical issues involved

211
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,840
here and he was Gerroelle had a PhD but didn't have medical degree the only other person at

212
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,120
the Institute bit of veterinarian Roger Barth and Wolcott Dunham had an MD and Wolcott was doing

213
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,560
some work with guinea pigs and neurolatherism at the time but he was pretty advanced in age at

214
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,480
that time and was not physically very vigorous and Cameron was still very vigorous and of course

215
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
very interesting a lot of these issues and I think through conversation with Gerroelle and Paul

216
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,280
and Cameron just naturally gravitated to that especially once it had been demonstrated at vitamin C

217
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,960
might have an important role to play there. So what was the reaction to this

218
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,800
research both in the scientific community and in the public? Well I can't really say that I know

219
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:26,160
what the reaction was in the scientific community. I think by then maybe many people thought that

220
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Linus Pauling was going to just publish great stuff about vitamin C no matter what and that you know

221
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,040
we'd never find anything coming from the Pauling Institute that had anything to do with a negative

222
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,440
effect of vitamin C just so happens that all these experiments were positive. So vitamin C's

223
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,080
not snake oil but it does have a lot of very important and interesting biochemical and physiological

224
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,800
functions in the body and protecting against and treating different diseases. So it's not a

225
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,160
panacea but it's really remarkable substance and it's easy to see while Linus Pauling gets so

226
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,240
interested in it early on. So I can't say what the what the professional reaction was I know that

227
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:13,120
there were AIDS there were doctors who treated AIDS patients who were very interested in our

228
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,720
results. In particular there were several physicians from San Francisco General at the AIDS

229
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,040
ward there who came down to the Institute and gave seminars and were in contact with Pauling

230
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,320
and Jeroelle about this and there was a lot of anecdotal evidence as well from San Francisco

231
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,640
in New York and other major urban centers and a lot of AIDS cases where some of the patients who

232
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,760
were self-medicating with high dose oral vitamin C seem to be doing a little bit better than

233
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,360
then their friends who were not taking high dose vitamin C but there weren't any controlled

234
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,880
clinical studies at that time and I don't think to date there had been any controlled clinical trials

235
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:00,320
on vitamin C and HIV infection or AIDS and of course the RCTs are most persuasive when it comes

236
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,320
to adopting new strategies in medicine. So absent RCTs I think probably a lot of physicians just

237
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,800
ignored it you know it's in the realm of anecdotal evidence it really doesn't mean anything it's

238
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,800
just coincidence yeah and vitamin C might have some value but it's such a pedestrian substance and I'm

239
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:24,240
sure that there are more promising biotherapies that we get involved in and you can't completely

240
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,120
disregard the political or financial perspectives in that whole debate either because a lot of

241
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,080
physicians who are charged with running clinical trials to evaluate drugs stand a benefit from

242
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,000
financially from from the revenue stream should that drug turn out to be effective so

243
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,160
a lot of people have tremendous incentive to study drug therapy and there's just not the same type

244
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:56,560
of incentive with vitamin C so but public reaction I think varied of course people who were

245
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,520
afflicted with AIDS or had friends who were afflicted with AIDS were quite interested

246
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,360
and very appreciative of the Institute's work other people who were a little bit

247
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:16,960
who felt for whatever moral reason that that AIDS was a behavioral disease and that we shouldn't

248
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,160
really waste money studying these problems that are due to behavior and if people would just

249
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,080
change their behavior wouldn't have to worry about this so some of those people with Drew support

250
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,080
and again as we saw after the negative male clinic studies on vitamin C and cancer there was

251
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:45,680
a lapse in some financial response to our direct male solicitation campaign but of course

252
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,040
that never influenced the work that we undertook I mean we undertook work that was

253
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:00,000
fundable either from grants or contracts or from unrestricted funds were available to us

254
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,760
and be quests for the direct male program but I can't ever recall any discussion that suggested

255
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,920
that any line of work at the Institute should be stopped because it was a negative effect on either

256
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,720
the you know how to the media where we're down we're we're nullifying it or

257
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:27,760
castigating it or donors were we're shining away because of that work so I think I think that kind of

258
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,160
emulates Pauling's courageous attribute and not backing down if you felt he was right and I think

259
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,960
the Institute sort of adopted that same strategy some important research to do and we're not

260
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,520
going to back down just because there's a loss of revenue you mentioned a Cameron and Pauling wrote

261
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,720
a book about the subject that was kind of published you know why that is a case shop in

262
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,600
my feeling is that they wrote the book without having talked any publisher and advanced to find out

263
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,560
first of all if there was any interest in the book so they had no publishing contract and secondly

264
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:12,160
I think the book was finished or nearly finished when Cameron became ill and I think his illness

265
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,920
probably led him to pay less attention to it or be less excited about it but I infer that I don't

266
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,840
know that for sure so we talked earlier about the vitamin C and cancer research and the perspective

267
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,120
from the in the Institute the staff being generally on board behind the thinking was of the

268
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,320
status in case the same with the vitamin C aid work as well I think so I mean I never talked to anybody

269
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,000
the Institute who expressed any squorn or negative feelings about that work I mean I think everybody

270
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,360
the Institute was relatively small and fairly collegial I mean there were certain tensions

271
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,240
and conflicts that developed over time of course from time to time as in any organization but I

272
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,440
think I think people were very respectful of one another when it came to the science like that

273
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,080
in 1989 Mathias Rat arrived at the Institute and I'm wondering if you could share your first

274
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,800
impressions of Rat yeah my first impressions were that he seemed like a very knowledgeable

275
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,880
earnest fellow he clearly had developed some exciting ideas with Linus Pauling and it was

276
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,760
great to see Linus Pauling and thused about the slip-up protein vitamin C story

277
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,400
so my initial reactions were quite favorable it wasn't until I became aware of some

278
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,400
other activities it seemed to be going on outside the purview of the Institute the Linus part

279
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,320
hard foundation and some other things which seemed to be a little obscure and not really conducted

280
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,200
in a transparent way that people began to question motivation in particular why are these other

281
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,240
organizations being set up what are they designed to do are they designed to compete with the

282
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,280
Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine this is a complementary activity and because a lot of

283
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,720
that kind of information wasn't forthcoming when you have kind of that black box it generates lots

284
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,320
of rumors and that's unfortunate and I think that there was certainly some of that going around

285
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,520
at the time although Linus Pauling also had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and Rat was providing

286
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,440
some medical services for Pauling himself and I think everybody appreciated that that here

287
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,320
was somebody at the Institute that Pauling was really interested in from a scientific standpoint

288
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,520
and was also looking out for Pauling's physical welfare so I think I think initially everybody was

289
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:59,280
quite enthused about this collaboration well I think initially he seemed to be very German

290
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:11,040
he didn't really seem to have a terribly great sense of humor it seemed to be very I won't

291
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:26,000
say solemn but very serious minded polite seem to treat people fairly there was some socializing

292
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,920
there was you know throughout the history of the Institute different employees and groups of

293
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,720
people would go out for dinners or lunch or go to bars on weekends or whatever and there was

294
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,080
there was some of that kind of activity as well what was his research program that

295
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,960
playing was excited about well Pauling of course had been long interested in vitamin C and cardiovascular

296
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
disease and he'd written about this in his book had a little longer feel better he'd also

297
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,240
written about it in articles for executive health which was a tabloid type newsletter he'd also

298
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,960
written about it for the Linus Plan Institute Science and Medicine newsletter in the 1970s and 1980s

299
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,000
primarily in the 1980s so he had a long abiding interest in the possible value of vitamin C

300
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,400
and preventing a treating heart disease rat had some specific interest in data on the potential

301
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,840
interaction between vitamin C and lipoprotein A which is a major constituent of atherosclerotic

302
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,160
plaque and also a risk factor for heart disease the problem with lipoprotein A is that it's

303
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:45,440
levels in the blood don't seem to be amenable to modification by dietary or even drug strategy

304
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,760
they're fairly they're genetically determined and they're very difficult to modulate

305
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,680
so there's a lot of skepticism is to where the vitamin C could actually affect lipoprotein A levels in blood

306
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:04,000
rat had apparently some a small set of clinical data that apparently showed that vitamin C

307
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
might have value in decreasing lipoprotein A levels and I think that was very interesting to Pauling

308
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,720
and then together they developed the hypothesis that lipoprotein A may serve as a surrogate for

309
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,120
vitamin C in animals including people that do not synthesize vitamin C and there are some

310
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,960
evidence that lipoprotein A levels in animals and people not synthesizing vitamin C were high

311
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,320
and lipoprotein A levels seem to be low in the blood of those animals that were synthesizing

312
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,080
vitamin C and that led them to think about well what is lipoprotein A doing

313
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,640
the vitamin C might otherwise do in the body and they believe that lipoprotein A might be synthesized

314
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,120
by the body to contend with and repair fissures that develop in the vascular church due to

315
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,840
oxidative damage or shear stress and other things of that nature so it might have a valuable role

316
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,640
in repairing lesions but that because it's a very sticky molecule it could

317
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:10,640
could end up developing into atherosclerotic plaque and from the original hypothesis there

318
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,760
were a number of correlaries that developed including the potential role of lysine in helping

319
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,360
to either decrease plaque or keelate and remove lipoprotein A from the blood and Pauling

320
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,960
published in the Journal of Worth Molecular Medicine in the early 1990s three case reports

321
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,440
of people who had suffered from severe angina exercise induced angina who had had

322
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,440
very serious cardiovascular disease bypass and other surgical interventions and still had

323
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,200
angina and they read Pauling's papers with RAF and decided to try adding lysine to their

324
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,360
regimen and in some cases these people had already been taking fairly high doses of vitamin C

325
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,760
and then added lysine. They weren't controlled studies so these were reported as anecdotes

326
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,880
in the amount of lysine in vitamin C was quite variable but it was on the order of three to six

327
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:16,720
grams per day of each and they reported fairly rapid relief from angina so Pauling speculated that

328
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:23,520
perhaps because the relief was so rapid that lysine might even buy into lipoprotein A in plaque

329
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,840
and help remove it from plaque and that was possibly explaining why these people were not

330
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,000
suffering from angina because the plaque was the thickness of the plaque was decreasing.

331
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,840
Well it turns out subsequent research has revealed that vitamin C has very important effects

332
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,440
in vasodilation in sort of improving blood flow in people with atherosclerotic plaque

333
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,160
through its effects on tetrahedrobiopterin which is involved in synthesis of nitric oxide which

334
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,560
improves blood flow but the role of lysine in this process is still obscure and I don't think

335
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,600
other than Pauling's hypothesis I don't think there's been much speculation as to why lysine

336
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,320
in particular might have had this benefit because as I mentioned some of the people that were

337
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,680
reported in these case studies had already been taking very high dose vitamin C without

338
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,600
presumably any benefit yet when they added lysine there seemed to be a fairly dramatic effect

339
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
so that I thought was a very it's an interesting area and probably a rich area for research

340
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,080
although as far as I know no one's really looked into it. So those were some of the ideas that

341
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,960
Pauling and Wrath were developing in that that period that I think were exciting to everybody and

342
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,000
as I as I came to understand the Linus Point Heart Foundation was specifically set up

343
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,760
to raise money to support clinical trials on some of these potential therapies including

344
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,480
Proline, lysine, vitamin C, niacin, and so forth.

345
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,640
We'll talk more about Wrath here in a second. There's a couple of things that happen sort of

346
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:08,000
chronologically that I want to touch on first in 1990. There was a reason effort in Paloco

347
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,040
which I have the city gave the Institute three years to move basically. All right. What was the

348
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,320
reaction of that and how did you start applying for that? Well that was very interesting. That was about

349
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,800
the same time that Emil Zootke-Kandel and Rick Hicks retired from the Linus Point Heart Foundation

350
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,560
to Science and Medicine and set up the Institute for Molecular Medical Sciences and we least

351
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,640
them space within the facility at 440 page Mel Road to do that. So that was a very contentious

352
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,600
time. Emil and Rick Hicks left the Institute. Emil still had strong interest in preserving

353
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:52,560
a research program and yet didn't have a lot of funding available to him. So Pauling wanted us to find

354
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:00,640
out whether or not us meaning Stephen Maddox myself and Zee Kerman to find out whether this was

355
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,080
practical and feasible to subbly space in Linus Point, Jr. is involved in that as well. To

356
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,240
subly space to IMMS within the building and how the building might be partitioned and how equipment

357
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,760
might be made available to IMMS or how they could share equipment and so on and so forth. So that was

358
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,440
kind of a contentious time at the Institute but resulted in a sub least IMMS because we found

359
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:35,600
a way to make everything work to everyone satisfaction. And at about that time I had become executive

360
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:42,960
officer of the Institute and was working very closely with Linus Pauling Jr. Because Linus Pauling

361
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:51,520
Senior was undergoing treatment for cancer and still had problems in structural chemistry

362
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,160
and theoretical chemistry and and orthomolic in the medicine that he really wanted to devote his

363
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,280
time to. So Linus Pauling Jr. in the board decided to free his father from administrator

364
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,400
responsibilities and Linus Point Jr. would sort of step in as president or director of the

365
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,880
Institute and I would assist him and initially I was asked by Linus Pauling to assist him and then later

366
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,880
when it became clear that he wasn't really interested in exercising any administrator

367
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,760
responsibility Linus Pauling Jr. stepped in and then I worked very closely with Linus Pauling Jr.

368
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,080
And that was my first understanding of the fact that the Institute had the zoning problem

369
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,720
and apparently it had been known for a long time but nobody had really done much about it.

370
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,760
So Linus Pauling Jr. and I and the board realized that absent and endowment and a lot of money

371
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,760
it was really going to be difficult for us to sustain the Institute as a viable biomedical

372
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,720
research organization if we had to move because we had a very favorable

373
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,960
leasing arrangement with our landlords, the cost of the lease went up only adjusted by CPI, the consumer

374
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,200
price index. So we were paying I think 50 or 55 cents a square foot for 20,000 plus square foot building

375
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:22,960
in Palo Alto and to move we would have been looking at probably 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 dollars

376
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,040
of square foot. So the prospect of moving was not very satisfying because it meant that we would

377
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,560
be spending much more money on just simply renting the facility and not have much money available

378
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,440
to pay staff, recruit or do research. So that was not an appealing option at all.

379
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
Yet we were suddenly aware that we had three years when we really had to leave because the

380
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,480
master plan in Palo Alto called for changing the mix of commercial and residential properties

381
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,200
because they were becoming very concerned that there weren't enough residential units for people

382
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,760
that worked in Palo Alto and it's kind of a I don't want to go off on a tangent but I had long

383
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,680
discussions with city planners, city staff, the planning committee for Palo Alto and some of the

384
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,880
council members and my opinion at the time was well that's fine. You can build condominiums or

385
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,960
apartment buildings here but there's no way you can ensure that the people who rent or buy these

386
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,400
condos or apartment buildings are going to work in Palo Alto because Palo Alto has a very desirable

387
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,640
address. People might move here and work in Sunnyvale or San Francisco or Hayward or these Bay

388
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,840
or the South Bay and you're just going to increase traffic and it's going to become not necessarily

389
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,680
the outcome that you're striving for with this zoning change but be that as it may we really had to

390
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:55,280
face the inevitable which was the zoning was going to change and so I decided that it was imperative

391
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,680
to delay that until we could really come up with a proper solution for for the Institute's future

392
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,680
and taking a page out of line as Paul and Eva Helen's book we set up folding tables around town

393
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,160
outside grocery stores and cafes and had petitions and I can't remember the exact wording of the

394
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,240
petition but it was something to the effect please sign the petition if you'd like to see the

395
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,440
Institute stay at its location in Palo Alto if you feel that we're doing good work and so on and so forth

396
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,080
we had quite a few names sign in those petitions and they were eventually delivered to the

397
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,960
City Council and I made a presentation in the City Council. One is Paul made a presentation in the

398
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,640
City Council and eventually we squeak through with City Council approval to delay that zoning

399
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,760
change for a period of time because they recognized that we were doing valuable work and that we

400
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,760
really needed more time to chart a proper course for the future and it's one of the Palo Alto

401
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,560
City Council members mentioned she didn't want to read the New York Times that the city of Palo Alto

402
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:14,640
had kicked the line as Paul and Institute out of town. Yeah so that was a very successful campaign

403
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,960
and I should mention that during the City Council meeting appearances I felt well it's

404
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,720
good and fine for me to go and talk to the City Council and I'd met all of the City Council

405
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,960
members individually and pleaded our case to them and they seemed to be favorably disposed to the

406
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,680
Institute although some of them were wavering somewhat and I figured that I could make a pretty

407
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,240
compelling argument in front of the City Council during public testimony but I thought it would

408
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,480
really accentuate if line is Pauling himself could appear and I asked him if he would be willing to

409
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,480
do that and he said yes so he went with me to the City Council meeting and it just so happened

410
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,840
that that meeting of the City Council where they were scheduled to vote on this issue was the first

411
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:06,720
appearance by Geahart Casper who was president of the Stanford University and there was a tradition

412
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,200
where the president of the university would go and make I think on an annual basis of state of the

413
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,720
University address to the City Council because Stanford is adjacent to the City of Palo Alto and

414
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,800
they have a lot of mutual interests and mutual conflicts so they're they're very the city is always

415
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
interested in finding out what Stanford's doing and Stanford's always interested in finding out

416
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,400
what the city is planning so Geahart Casper was there to to spend 20 minutes or so giving his

417
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:43,200
address to the City Council and as Pauling walked in and the chambers were full of people who were

418
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,040
waiting to give testimony Geahart Casper recognized Pauling and ran over to him and the two of them

419
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,120
exchange pleasentries they'd never met before and Geahart Casper who I believe was scheduled before

420
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,280
me or before Pauling on the agenda spent quite a lot of his a lot of time talking about what a

421
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,040
wonderful person Linus Pauling was talked about at Stanford there are many Nobel Prize winners there

422
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,520
are so many that they really don't turn heads anymore except for Linus Pauling because Linus Pauling

423
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,960
was such an outstanding scholar and such an outstanding piece activist and scientists that when

424
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,160
Pauling was there heads did turn and I thought it was quite nice of Casper to talk about Pauling

425
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,800
and those glowing terms in Casper is a lawyer so he didn't really have professionally much

426
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,440
exposure to Linus Pauling's work in science but nevertheless he recognized that Pauling was

427
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:47,360
a really eminent scientist and really wanted to pay tribute to him so that kind of cinch the case for

428
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:56,400
as I think and also there was a fellow in the audience who stood up and introduced himself by name

429
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,800
and said that he felt Pauling's work was very important and the institutes work was very important

430
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:08,160
and really wanted to encourage the city council to delay the zoning change and at the end of the meeting

431
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,400
when we were waiting I was with Pauling and the underground garage waiting for the card to come

432
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,040
around and Pauling mentioned to me that he remembered that fellow who gave public testimony

433
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,080
he was a student of his a Caltech and he remembered an incident with him and said that when he was teaching

434
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,520
he had he had the secretic method of teaching where he would pick out people to answer questions

435
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,240
because the classes were apparently small enough he knew whole the students were new their

436
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,880
excuse me knew their names so during one of his chemistry lectures he had a

437
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,560
question and he picked this fellow out to answer the question and the fellow proceeded to

438
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,960
given answer there was really not the right answer but I guess he felt compelled to say something

439
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,920
so Pauling just nodded and thanked him for the response and at the end of the class Pauling went

440
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,520
up to him and said I'd like to talk with you for a moment and Pauling said you know it's perfectly

441
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,360
okay when you don't know the answer to a question to admit that and so you don't know the answer

442
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:15,680
actually it's far better than confabulating but I thought it was it was rather amazing that Pauling

443
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,720
remembered that particular incident and this particular fellow who I'm sure he hadn't thought

444
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:30,640
about or seen for decades yeah back track real quick I was interested to do that when

445
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:41,280
Zucacondal and Hicks were good friends and allies and they'd worked very very closely together

446
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,480
and had actually sacrificed a lot for the Institute a meal had loaned the Institute money gone

447
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,320
without salary or decrease salary and and Rick Hicks had been also very self-sacrificing

448
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,960
trying to help the Institute progress over the years so I think I think Rick felt when a

449
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:08,080
meal's contract was not renewed that he would leave as well and so both of them left but Hicks

450
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,560
was then voted to join the Board of Trustees of the Lions Plains 2 Science and Medicine which I

451
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,600
thought was a terrific collegial and important move for the Board of Trustees to make because Hicks had

452
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,840
a lot of insight into fundraising for the Institute and a lot just a lot of knowledge and insight

453
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,440
about the Institute in general and I thought that would be very important for him to to be associated

454
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,760
in a continued way with the Institute so I thought that was a very good strategic move to ask Rick

455
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,560
to become part of the Board and a meal of course had his hands full of trying to administer and get

456
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,480
his new Institute Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences off the ground and a meal had actually

457
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,960
wanted me as well as a number of other people Jim Fleming and Greg Spicer, Teddy Bullockos and

458
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:03,600
other people who were doing more molecular biological work that was not really directly allied with

459
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,800
orthomolecular medicine. For instance Greg Spicer was doing work in molecular evolution.

460
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,920
Jim Fleming was doing work in molecular basis of aging. Teddy Bullockos was working on

461
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,040
histones and DNA repair and a lot of those programs didn't really fit into the

462
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,840
orthomolecular scope of the Institute and when the Institute was reorganized when Hicks and Zucaconda

463
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:32,240
left the Board decided to refocus the limited resources on orthomolecular medicine so they wanted

464
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,200
to have a much more narrow focus and kind of pair away some of those programs that were not

465
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,160
closely allied with that mission because we just could not afford to do everything and those

466
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,800
programs that were being paired away a meal hoped to collect in this new organization

467
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,240
Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences and he did to some extent. Did that pre-successfully?

468
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,800
So this the version sent in the research engine that was the primary reason first of the

469
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,200
gross departure from the Institute. Do what? The reason that the divergence in the research

470
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,760
of dentist was his primary reason believing? Yeah when understanding was that the Board was very

471
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,560
concerned about income and outgo. So the Board had become increasingly concerned over the late 1980s

472
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,400
about the cost of all the programs at the Institute and the variable fundraising success.

473
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,080
The Cessacawa donation $500,000 a year for 10 years was coming to an end and couldn't be renewed

474
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:38,800
due to their charter stipulations. So it was difficult to find money to support some of this work

475
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,760
that was not grant funded and a lot of it was not grant funded. The years of yurka had a nice grant

476
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,120
from the Department of Energy that was funding his work on all those sequences and non-conserved

477
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:58,640
and concerned DNA and so forth. But a meals program that I was involved in looking at metastatic

478
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,280
cancer, Greg Spicer's work, some of the other work was really not funded except through

479
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:12,480
unrestricted funds to the Institute. So the Board decided to ask a meal to shrink the Institute

480
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:19,040
so that the expenses would be more aligned with the actual revenue instead of continuing to grow

481
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,840
the Institute or allowing it to continue at what they considered an infeasable size. And I think

482
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,960
a meal was didn't want to do that. So rather than do something that he didn't want to do,

483
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:43,440
I think he resigned and with him went with a kick. We talked about Cameron's illness and in 1991 he died.

484
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:51,440
I'm warning if he treated himself at all with some of the techniques that he'd been advocating for

485
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,440
you know. Yeah, that's very interesting. I had asked Cameron about his own habits with vitamin C

486
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,720
supplementation much earlier before he became sick and he said that he was taking a little vitamin

487
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,600
C but not taking mega doses because he thought that you know, should he ever get ill that he

488
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:16,240
wanted to reserve those mega doses for therapeutic value. I think he probably took some vitamin C

489
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:25,520
but as far as I know he never himself took intravenous vitamin C and again the differential

490
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,040
response to people getting intravenous vitamin C and oral vitamin C was not well characterized at that

491
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:38,080
time. It was clear that some of the patients getting IV vitamin C did very well. But also,

492
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,840
if you go back and look at the historical record, Cameron's patient pool, some of those early

493
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,640
patients that had complete necrosis of tumors got only oral vitamin C and the tumor necrosis

494
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,960
was a consequence temporally of that high dose oral vitamin C. So I think Cameron and others

495
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,080
believe that oral vitamin C had some anti cancer effects as well. Although much later, of course,

496
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,440
these transport molecules for vitamin C were discovered and this was after Cameron and Pauling

497
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,040
it both died. These discoveries were made. So now we have a better understanding of

498
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:19,040
the limitations of achieving high concentration of vitamin C and the blood when you take it only

499
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,160
early but in those days that wasn't well known. So Cameron may have felt and I never talked

500
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,000
him about this but he may have felt that since some of his patients did quite well apparently

501
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,640
on oral vitamin C that may be intravenous vitamin C was not important for him. But he also,

502
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:41,520
at the end of his illness, became less willing to see friends in colleagues.

503
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,920
So there were many occasions when Zelecurman and Zelec's girlfriend and I would go to

504
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,360
Connie Cameron's house in Redwood City and UN was not well enough to see visitors. So we would

505
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,120
sit and chat with Connie Cameron and offer her solace and ask her to pass on our good wishes to

506
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,480
you and but he clearly was not feeling well enough to see visitors.

507
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
What was the impact of the homie institute?

508
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:17,280
Well, UN was such a charismatic and wonderful man that it really had had a big impact on people personally.

509
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:25,920
I recall his memorial service in Redwood City. Zelec girlfriends,

510
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:32,160
Zelecurman's girlfriend played bagpipes and it was just an incredibly emotional of that.

511
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,480
People were really grieving about Cameron's death and of course Pauling was there and

512
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,000
rat was there as well. Everybody felt terrible about Cameron's death.

513
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,920
In 1992 the case rat was appointed vice president for financial affairs at the Institute of

514
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,640
this. That's a good question. That was 1992. You said? Yeah.

515
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,200
This was after Cameron's death. So Cameron was probably Pauling's closest collaborator

516
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,080
in Zelecurman of course as well. When rat arrived with these ideas about cardiovascular disease

517
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,400
and the propotein and vitamin C and he and Pauling started working very closely on this collaboration.

518
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,280
I think that sort of took center stage in Pauling's life and although he remained committed

519
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:37,040
to some of the problems that he was working with Zelecurman, I think his bond with rat

520
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:46,000
was getting stronger and stronger. I think Pauling may have unilaterally made that decision

521
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,640
to give that appointment to rat because he had no reason not to trust him. And clearly,

522
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,080
I think Pauling and rat perceived perhaps a new focus for research in the Institute which would

523
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,680
be vitamin C and art disease especially now that there was this reinvigeration of this

524
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,720
focus on orthomolecular medicine. So I think that perhaps it seemed logical that rat would be involved

525
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,040
there because they also had set up the heart foundation and other organizations to try to raise

526
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:23,600
money specifically for these clinical trials. So how do things start to unravel them?

527
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:34,800
Well, I think rat did a number of things that upset Pauling and caused some

528
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:43,280
consternation that was kind of a political strategy in a scientific realm which sometimes can

529
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,840
work and sometimes can backfire. And I remember there was one meeting I believe in Texas.

530
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,480
I can't remember the specific society but it was cardiovascular disease,

531
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,120
researchers and physicians and rat had zerox something and put it on every seat in the auditorium

532
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:09,360
for everybody to read and rat was also developing these ideas about big pharma trying to suppress

533
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,800
or inhibit work on orthomolecular medicine. And I think a lot of people share those

534
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:26,400
opinions to some degree. And rat just seemed to be using more of a political strategy to advance

535
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,440
the research agenda. And some of those things were done I think Pauling felt and others felt

536
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:42,080
maybe not an entirely appropriate manner. I remember seeing one press release that rat had written

537
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:50,160
and Pauling had written all over it that it was really unwise and uncalled for had nothing new to

538
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:59,600
announce. And I think Linus Pauling was starting to worry a little bit about the trust that he placed

539
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:10,880
in rat. So at some point when that fundraiser or executive vice president position was

540
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:19,440
I think graph resigned or that position was eliminated. Steven Maddox became Vice President for

541
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,400
Finance or Fundraising or whatever the particular title was. So he sort of succeeded

542
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,760
Rick Hicks after an interlude there with Matthias Raffping in that position for a while.

543
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,840
And Linus Pauling Jr. and I became increasingly concerned about

544
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,520
Raff and his activities. And we also became aware of the fact that Raff had not signed the patent agreement

545
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:57,360
and it was incumbent upon every employee as an obligation of employment to sign a patent agreement.

546
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,840
And the patent agreement was actually quite generous when people joined corporations as employees

547
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,720
they typically surrender. All their rights to the company. And many people can invent and discover

548
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,000
wonderful things for companies and not see a dime. Academic institutions attend a little bit

549
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,920
differently in our organization, which was modeled after an academic institution. It was fairly

550
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,760
generous to inventors. So the idea was that if you discover something that may be patentable in the

551
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,360
course of your employment at the Institute, you can bring that to the Institute's administration

552
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,400
in the decision we had a patent committee at the time and a decision can be made as to whether the

553
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,000
Institute would like to pursue this file to get the initiate the patent application process

554
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,200
or if the Institute did not want to pursue it then they would surrender it to you and you could

555
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,480
pursue it at your own expense and you would have the patent and you could go ahead and license it

556
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,520
and if there was a revenue stream that would be solely yours. So the patent agreement stipulated

557
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:03,280
should the Institute proceed to try to gain a patent for this invention or discovery

558
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,160
that should it be licensed the revenue would be split between the inventor and the Institute

559
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,640
and the following percentages. And everybody had signed that. Linus Pauling had signed that himself

560
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:21,360
and Wrath refused to sign it. I think initially he said he would like to think about it and I think

561
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,200
the choice was given to him well you know you really obligated as an employee to sign this and if you

562
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,720
don't want to sign it then you know perhaps you should think about resigning. So he asked for some

563
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,080
time to think about that and said fine and a day or two later he said that he wanted to quit

564
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,960
and wanted to resign and he did. What was the source of the litigation that he filed

565
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:53,200
against the Institute kind of that the right? Well he resigned and I really had no interest to or

566
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,080
I mean I mean I had my hands full of trying to solve a lot of the financial and personnel

567
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,920
and research problems at the Institute and think about where the Institute should go in the future

568
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,520
and Linus Pauling's health and all these other myriad problems that we were facing so I really didn't

569
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,280
keep up with what Wrath was doing because he resigned from the Institute he was gone. I didn't really

570
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:21,920
honestly care about what he was doing and it wasn't until maybe a year or so later that we were

571
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,320
served with a lawsuit and he had set up a company called Health Now Incorporated and this company

572
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,480
was suing Linus Pauling and the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine for interference with

573
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:41,920
its business activities and the gist of the suit was that Wrath apparently had been trying to get

574
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:49,520
to forge business relationships with supplement companies and he was bringing to them these

575
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,000
ideas about vitamin C and heart disease and lysine and so forth presumably to formulate new

576
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,240
products or whatever and according to the suit he had met with discouragement from some of these

577
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:06,800
company representatives because they didn't know who he was and they would point to new stories

578
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:12,640
about Linus Pauling and vitamin C and cardiovascular disease or heart health and in many of those

579
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:19,520
stories Wrath's name was omitted not because Pauling failed to give him credit because Pauling I think

580
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,920
was very fair and egalitarian about that and would always mention Wrath when he talked to journalists

581
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,960
or media about these ideas and lipoprotein A and vitamin C and heart disease authors

582
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,520
clorosis but because Wrath was kind of an unknown quantity and really had no reputation to speak of

583
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,280
and I'm just inferring this media often would drop his name and the focus would be on Linus Pauling

584
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,640
and I think Wrath found that very frustrating and discouraging because he perceived that

585
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:57,600
that lack of credit interfering with his ability to to make these business relationships with

586
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,560
different supplement companies and so he found an attorney and decided to file suit against the

587
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:14,000
institute and that led to actually his complaint was dismissed essentially but we thought the

588
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,560
cross complaint because in the course of this litigation he had made a lot of statements that we

589
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:28,000
thought were injurious to our activities. At the time we were trying to forge a relationship with

590
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,680
Elizabeth Arden and Unilever Corporation who were interested in developing a line of

591
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,400
cosmetic products that would include things like vitamin C and antioxidants and phytochemicals

592
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,960
and they wanted to support some research at the Institute and get involved with the Institute

593
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,000
and interesting ways and Wrath had started to communicate with these people telling them that we were

594
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,880
unreliable business partners and so on and so forth and that he owned all these rights and

595
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:58,960
so we we felt compelled to sue him to stop interfering with our business relationships

596
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:06,320
and during the course of this litigation Wrath alluded to some agreements that he had

597
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:11,760
executed with Linus Pauling that he claimed gave him all kinds of rights that we weren't aware of.

598
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,920
So Linus Pauling Jr and I were we're bewildered by this and we went to the documents that

599
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,320
Dorothy Monroe pulled out of a file for us and she showed us these agreements that

600
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,840
look like had been written by Wrath and signed by Pauling and then in some cases witnessed by a third

601
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:41,280
party and they had to do with Wrath's rights essentially and we were very surprised by these documents

602
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:49,520
they didn't seem to be proper and we took them to Linus Pauling and showed them to him and asked

603
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,840
him if he had any memory of these documents or the circumstances under which he signed them

604
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,080
and he looked at them very carefully and was confused about them and said red them and said

605
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:07,040
well that certainly looks like my name I believe that that's my signature but I don't recall

606
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:14,160
the content of this document at all and now that I read it I would not have signed it so we tried to

607
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,240
reconstruct why Linus Pauling signed these documents and we came to the impression and again

608
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,440
it's hard to verify this independently I can't be verified independently but based on statements

609
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,560
that Dorothy Monroe and others made we came to the opinion that Wrath had gotten Pauling to sign

610
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:40,080
these documents when he was executive vice president and may have gone into Pauling's office with

611
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,320
a whole sheath of documents for Pauling to execute and these documents were probably among those papers

612
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:53,280
and Pauling just signed them without reading them carefully and it turned out in the consequence

613
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,600
of litigation the documents that Pauling had signed giving Wrath lots of rights and ownership

614
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:08,400
were nullified for lack of compensation so how is all of the litigation ago

615
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,440
well litigation when was resolved you know typically the court really encourages you to come to a

616
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,880
settlement and there are settlement conferences set up by the court to get the parties together

617
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,400
to hash out a settlement because the court really doesn't want to get involved in litigation unless

618
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,920
it's absolutely necessary so they have retired judges who mediate these settlement conferences and

619
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,040
the retired judge seems to have the strategy of keeping people in a room until they give up

620
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:45,280
where dad and settle and it's a strategy I think that works pretty often so we had a number of

621
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,760
settlement conferences and eventually rather than going through a trial Wrath sued against us

622
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,280
had been dismissed so the only remaining issue was our suit against him across complaint

623
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:05,760
excuse me for libel and judicious inferences called interference where their business

624
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:12,400
relationship I can't remember the exact terminology so that was what was on the table to settle

625
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,320
the suit against health now and Wrath so we came to a settlement that we were satisfied with we

626
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,800
Wrath was supposed to pay us at least $75,000 we were not to disparage his activities he

627
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:33,760
would not disparage our activities mutual non disparagement and we assigned him some patents that

628
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,000
he basically had had done the work on so we felt you know we'd be fine to give him those patents

629
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,040
we didn't really expect them to generate any income anyway and that was the the just of the settlement

630
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:59,200
by and large and Wrath never paid the $75,000 so we mentioned a little bit of the course of this interview

631
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,200
the role that line is pointing you played and essentially inserting himself and dealing with

632
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:11,280
somebody administrative issues that his father was utter disinterested or unable to do because of

633
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,240
advancing age in the client health I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on sort of last

634
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,280
years arrival at the Institute in the role that he played in those last years of his father's life

635
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:28,560
yeah well when the the staff became aware of the fact that there were problems or financial

636
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,200
problems so this was you know sometime in the very early 1990s and then when Pauling had been diagnosed

637
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,800
and disclosed his disease publicly there was quite a lot of anxiety I would say because people

638
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,120
really weren't sure what was going to happen to them to the research programs to the Institute

639
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:54,320
and there was just a lot of unease among the staff and the board I think recognized this and

640
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,840
realized that they had to do something specific and concrete and make some very definite steps

641
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,440
and kind of clarify all the ambiguity and gossip that was going around and kind of put it into the

642
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,400
gossip and really lay things out here's where the status is now and here's where we're going to

643
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,960
future and Linus Plan Jr had been a board member right from the the early days at the Institute

644
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:24,160
but I think he recognized that his father was unwilling or unable to resolve some of these issues

645
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:32,160
in a really meaningful way so he decided to assert himself more in the role of the board so he decided

646
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:39,040
or I guess with the board and his father's acknowledgement he became chairman of the board of trustees

647
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:48,960
and Linus Pauling became director of research I think at that time too so because Pauling was

648
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,360
essentially directing a lot of the research at the Institute anyway so he was director of research

649
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,000
Linus Plan Jr I believe became chairman of the board and then at some point in there I moved from

650
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,320
becoming executive officer to chief executive officer and because Linus Pauling Jr was chairman of the board

651
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:10,880
and we had lots of problems and I had very little experience in large scale administration I'd been

652
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,720
administering a relatively small research group with a little bit of fundraising activity and a

653
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:23,280
little bit of public relations I frequently gave tours to the two people who visited the

654
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:28,000
Institute and wanted to learn about our science so I had some skills there I guess or some

655
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,600
experience at least and Linus Plan Jr and I started to work very closely together so I had really

656
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:41,440
I had seen him before but I had never really worked intensively with him until he sort of took over

657
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:48,800
management for his father in those early days nearly part of the decade there and I found him to be

658
01:09:48,880 --> 01:10:00,800
very a very reasonable, forceful, thoughtful person and I really appreciated his skill and essentially

659
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,520
wisdom in addressing some of these issues that faced the Institute he seemed to have a pretty

660
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,280
pretty good way of analyzing some of the problems and together we worked up strategies to

661
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,160
to solve some of the issues that we were facing. Was it all intentional for them to be instituted

662
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,680
through the rival and the assumption of his role? I don't think so because I think most people

663
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:27,440
realized that Linus Plan was not going to be an effective administrator of the Institute at that stage

664
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:34,160
so somebody needed to take put their hand on the rudder of the ship and start to exercise some

665
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:40,640
direction and I think people were I mean I can't say what everybody's reaction was about me

666
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,080
becoming chief executive officer because that was an unusual move. I didn't have an advanced degree

667
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:52,000
although I had been co-directing a relatively small research group and there were other people

668
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:00,400
with seniority that one could have predicted would have been asked to become chief executive officer.

669
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:07,600
I'm not quite sure why I was asked but I was honestly I was a little flattered and I thought

670
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,040
I felt very stimulated by the challenge of becoming chief executive officer learning more about

671
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,760
what problems the Institute faced and how to solve them because I always considered myself a

672
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,720
bit of a problem solver and here was a whole set of what seemed to be very, very serious problem so

673
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,200
I'm not sure I would have taken the job and you know if I'd known when they asked me

674
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,400
to become CEO the magnitude of the problems that the Institute faced but I'm glad I did.

675
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,040
What was the biggest challenge in hindsight for you as doing that role?

676
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:47,200
Well the biggest problem the biggest immediate problem was funding and it was heartbreaking for me

677
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:54,640
to lay off people that I had worked with and for for a very, very long time absolutely heartbreaking.

678
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,360
I mean I literally had tears as when I was telling people that there was no longer job for

679
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:07,280
them at the Institute but it was a fact of life and it was sort of my first first exposure to

680
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:13,760
what it's like to be in charge and make unpopular decisions or decisions that you don't want to

681
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,960
make as a person but you're obligated to make because of the role that you're playing in an

682
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:30,560
organization so it was it was difficult too. A couple more questions for today one event in the

683
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,360
Institute that seemed to come at exactly the right time was it the donation of the state of

684
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:41,360
Carl Spontner. Yes yes you give any background on this this is something that seems to

685
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,520
provide a bit of a lifeline to the Institute that most needed it. That's right and it's

686
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:51,200
a matter of fact I remarked to a meal because a meal had already decided that that time that he was

687
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,640
leaving that was kind of a bittersweet news for a meal because on the one hand you know this was

688
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:02,400
the salvation financial salvation for the Institute but other decisions that already been made

689
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:09,600
so it came a little too late in some regard swadner to the best of my understanding had been a

690
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:16,880
a donor to the Institute for quite a long time very small amounts of money and at the time

691
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:25,200
the Institute did not have access to a lot of research capability to investigate donors based on

692
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:32,960
tax filings or real estate holdings or zip code or anything like that. These days it's very sophisticated

693
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:39,440
kind of donor research that philanthropic organizations or foundations can do to find out

694
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:46,320
really who among their constituents have the ability to to make large gifts of one sort or another

695
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,040
back then we didn't really have that ability so there was no way of targeting people who were

696
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,040
giving small donations to the Institute for cultivation for instance and the other kinds of

697
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,640
fundraising strategies that might be developed to encourage people to give money so as a big surprise

698
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,400
when we were notified about this estate that had lots of different aspects to it I believe there was

699
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:16,880
an office building at home and gold coins and money and just a lot of different financial instruments

700
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:23,840
within this estate and it really did allow us to pay off some of the debts to trustees who had

701
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:31,280
loaned the Institute money and to kind of get on an even keel a bit and we also within a a

702
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:38,480
couple years became aware of another big request the Phineastate which also helped us

703
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,360
establish enough money so that we could have an endowment that would make the Institute more attractive

704
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:53,760
to a college or university to which we might move and it allowed us to bring $1.5 million

705
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:02,000
at least to Oregon State University when we moved up here in 1996 to endow the director's position

706
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,720
and at that time there was a match in the state so there was a functional $3 million

707
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:11,520
endowment which was really a good endowment to attract top caliber scientists for this

708
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,200
director ship at the Linus Pong Institute but getting back to the Phineastate.

709
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:26,400
The Phineastate was sometime in the early 1990s maybe 93 through 94 or 5 I don't really remember

710
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,960
the exact date at that time I was also negotiating contracts with Elizabeth Arden that I expected

711
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:42,720
would produce a very considerable revenue stream for the Institute for a very conceivably quite a long

712
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:48,720
time and that to me look like it might be the Salvation Financial Salvation for the Institute

713
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,960
and allow the Institute to remain as an independent biomedical organization and recruit

714
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:02,880
a track top caliber scientists but that was still under negotiation and under development we

715
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,200
weren't quite sure where that was going to go. I got a phone call from a woman in New Jersey I believe

716
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:16,320
who said that she wanted to know if I was aware of, the beginning was Katherine Finney,

717
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,600
Katherine Finney and not quite sure what her first name was but this woman had been her best friend

718
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:28,880
and was aware of the last will and testament and told me that she herself had been named

719
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:37,040
as the beneficiary in the will and was to receive a condominium and the Institute was to receive

720
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:45,120
most of the financial instruments that were available in the estate and then I think there was

721
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,400
small donations elsewhere but it was a fairly large amount of money and several million dollars

722
01:16:51,360 --> 01:17:01,200
and the woman told me that Finney had been deteriorating in recent months and a caregiver had

723
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:09,600
come to live with her and this caregiver apparently had persuaded Finney to alter her will

724
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,240
and leave everything to him and the woman who called me thought that this was really

725
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:22,160
unethical and unjust and that this person had exploited deteriorating woman to his own financial gain

726
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,120
and it sure seemed that way to me I mean I didn't know what the facts of the case were but I hired

727
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:35,440
a firm in New Jersey to look into it and it resulted in a nice settlement for the Institute where

728
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:42,480
we got the belief several million dollars, the caretaker ended up with several hundred thousand

729
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,640
dollars and the woman who brought this to our attention ended up with her condominium.

730
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,680
What happened to the Elizabeth Arden relationship?

731
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,520
Elizabeth Arden relationship was quite promising I was really excited by that because there was

732
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,160
a research element too that they were quite interested in funding research that would

733
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:09,600
find out if vitamin C and other micronutrients or phytochemicals could protect skin cells,

734
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:16,800
caretinasites from damage by sun exposure because they were starting to develop cosmetic

735
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,720
topical cosmetic products that included these micronutrients and they also had some

736
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,600
preliminary data from their own labs that suggested that topical application of vitamin C and

737
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:34,160
other substances improved the appearance of the skin and I think from from a marketing standpoint

738
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:40,000
they were excited about getting involved with the Institute because as the director of research told

739
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,960
me their facility was in trouble Connecticut he's the one who really got in contact with us

740
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,440
and asked us if we were interested in working with them in this regard he said you know he

741
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:56,000
started thinking about vitamin C well who who really knows the most about vitamin C and as well

742
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,800
it's Linus Paul and I should contact the Linus Paul Institute and he did and we decided because

743
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,080
the prospect of revenue was so great or the prospect of a lot of revenue was so great that

744
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:13,280
wasn't something that we should just take lightly or dismiss so we spent a lot of time thinking

745
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,480
about this and analyzing it and we were in some of the trustees were concerned about the

746
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:26,480
commercial exploitation of the name Linus Pauling and they thought you know perhaps if

747
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,600
this product bombs and were associated with it that maybe it will tarnish our reputation

748
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:37,200
but we worked out an agreement where we had review of all the marketing literature that

749
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,160
ardent and unilever would produce and they could make certain factual statements about what they were

750
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:47,680
doing at the Institute supporting a research project and so forth and that we were not engaged

751
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:53,040
in researching development with ardent looking to formulate new products with ardent and that

752
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:58,800
wasn't something that was part of this arrangement or relationship and then we agreed to produce

753
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:05,520
a joint newsletter that would be translated into many different languages and available at

754
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,560
point of sale in high end department stores around the world and we did that one newsletter

755
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:19,520
which featured an interview with Linus Pauling. Lester Packer also had an article in that

756
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,640
and some information about the Institute because I saw this as a way of expanding

757
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:32,880
our base of constituents because if we could introduce the Institute and its activities

758
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,880
to younger people or middle-aged people that shop at these high end department stores

759
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,680
presumably they have high income that they might get interested in supporting the Institute's

760
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:50,720
research and may at some point you know in the distant future decide to give us

761
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,440
requests as well if they thought the work we were doing was was good so I thought this I thought this

762
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:04,560
was a good way to expand the Institute's influence get more public education about what we were

763
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,320
doing and generate revenue for the Institute and in addition to that exposure there was also a

764
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:17,760
financial element where we would gain financially from the sale of some of their products and this

765
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:26,160
looked to be remarkably large magnitude of money for us really staggering amount of money possibly

766
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,080
and everything was great I went to Humber, Germany and to New York City and Toronto participated

767
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,880
in press conferences the marketing materials were all developed the product line was about to be launched

768
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:46,080
and the president of Elizabeth Arden Bob Phillips at the time left Arden to take a job with

769
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:52,400
Unilever in London which is the parent company of Elizabeth Arden and they hired a new president

770
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,120
from Chicago and this new president came in and proceeded to turn the company upside down

771
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:04,080
suspended a lot of the research contracts except for ours suspended a lot of the marketing efforts for

772
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:11,280
new products and things like that so unfortunately although everything everybody had expectations for

773
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,280
great success because of this management change at Arden it really interfered with the role out of all these

774
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:24,080
products and marketing strategies and everything else and she was she left the company after a year

775
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:31,520
and it took them a couple of years after that to fully recover so needless to say our high hopes

776
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:38,400
were somewhat dashed there because of management issues that Elizabeth Arden and they never followed

777
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:45,040
one of the many years afterwards they may have you know I don't really follow the cosmetics industry

778
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:49,680
so I don't know what they did subsequently but the relationship with the Institute eventually came

779
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:55,280
to an end they continued to provide money you know because we had a contract we had a contract

780
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:04,080
with Elizabeth Arden and we had a sub license from LC Progeny to use the name Linus Pauling and

781
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,360
so we could use that name in our association or contractual association with Elizabeth Arden and they

782
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:16,000
were funding a research project as I mentioned that was transferred to LPI at Oregon State so

783
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,240
the funding continued for some time and then eventually that project funding ran out and then that was

784
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:29,920
the end of the relationship but they also underwrote our newsletter and they provided

785
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:37,600
I was talking to John McCook who was the vice president for research at Arden and

786
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:44,480
after Pauling's death I brought up with him the prospect of doing a very nice commemorative issue

787
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,760
of the newsletter that would pay tribute specifically to Linus Pauling and he thought that was terrific

788
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:57,040
idea and we didn't have the money to produce anything really nice ourselves high volume so Arden

789
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:04,240
very graciously underwrote the commemorative booklet that we produced in lieu of a fall newsletter

790
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:16,880
in 1994 after Linus Pauling died. So the last question for today is August of 94 Linus Pauling

791
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,880
dies how would you characterize the state of the Institute at the point? Well it was a terrible day

792
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,360
I mean it was a day that we knew was inevitable but you never want to get that news even

793
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:34,160
when you know you should be expecting it. It was a summer day a beautiful day in Palo Alto

794
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:41,040
Pauling had been at his ranch in Big Sur and so a permanent eye and some other people had been

795
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,160
down to see him there was a deposition actually of Pauling I believe earlier that summer by our

796
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:53,840
attorneys that we went down for but I didn't have any direct knowledge of his deterioration or

797
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,400
or health status I knew that he wasn't doing really well but I didn't really have any first-hand

798
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:06,880
knowledge of what he was doing there so we had worked up in a bituary based on information available

799
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:12,960
to us from his biography and from Paradowski's work and probably from materials that were available

800
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,480
to us from special collections so we had an obituary ready to go and of course this was as I said before

801
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:25,760
the internet so the obituary was to be fact upon notification of Pauling's death so it had been a

802
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,760
typically difficult day at the Institute for me it was always challenging in those days with litigation

803
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:37,200
and financial problems and thinking about the future just position of the Institute and so forth and

804
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:45,440
I remember going home that day in August and I had a couple of beers before dinner and I got

805
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:51,920
a call from Linus Pond Jr before I had a chance to eat and Linus Pond Jr told me that it's father

806
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:59,040
had just died and it really hit me hard because I was kind of surprised at my own emotional reaction

807
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:05,440
because I really loved Linus Pond he was just an amazing person so immediately I got back to my

808
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:12,000
car I went back to the Institute and I started faxing these obituraries which I had a stack of obituraries

809
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:20,880
with media contact numbers so they went to CBS, New York Times, NBC, excuse me see and then

810
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,480
whatever the media context we had I'd sent that them out San Francisco Chronicles and as a

811
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:34,400
mercury they were probably 15 or 20 of these to be faxed out so no sooner had I faxed the third

812
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,000
out and the phone started ringing and in those days we had an old fashioned phone system where you could

813
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,560
see a number of little pegs that would light up for an incoming line and I think that there

814
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,240
were as many as six incoming lines so you could look at a single phone and see six of these

815
01:26:52,240 --> 01:27:00,320
clear pegs and a peg would be lit depending upon what the incoming number was and at first you know

816
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,560
through the third fax there was one of these little pegs that lit up so I answered it

817
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:12,480
while I was continuing to fax and it was newsweek or something and they wanted some pithy quotes

818
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:20,480
about the life of Linus Pond and it wasn't difficult for me but it really took some effort to hold

819
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:28,480
myself together to give them cogent statements about Linus Pond because I was feeling really sad

820
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:36,240
and I was manically trying to fax all these obituaries out and before long every light was lit

821
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:41,840
and blinking and it was the New York Times it was CBS it was everybody under the Sunworn statements

822
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:48,560
so I spent the better part of that early evening there responding to all these all these phone

823
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,960
calls for more information and then the next day of course everybody at the Institute knew that Linus Pond

824
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,280
had died and there was a lot of grief people were crying and it was it was a really difficult time for

825
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:09,040
everybody in terms of being the footing of being instituted so like that point where how do character

826
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:15,840
actually mean the namesake of the instituted just died and what is what the outlook for the

827
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:23,760
organization at that point yeah we had of course in the board of trustees meetings which we had

828
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:29,040
very regularly by the way and then we had reports that went out to the board every month

829
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:35,120
because there were so many problems and we wanted everything to be done as perfectly as possible

830
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:40,000
so I would write a report to the board of trustees every month and send it off to all of them by

831
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,600
facts and that would cover all the personal issues financial issues I would have the account and

832
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,440
give us a status of our bank accounts investments and so forth so that everybody knew all the

833
01:28:51,440 --> 01:29:02,000
time exactly where we were and of course we took very seriously the problem of leaving the building

834
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,440
in Palo Alto and Linus Pond had expressed the desire I think his his first priority was for the

835
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,320
Institute to remain independent because I thought I think he felt that we could probably

836
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:22,320
be unswade by mainstream medicine or mainstream science if we retained independence we could be

837
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:29,760
more a conoclastic and more of a maverick organization but absent that he completely supported the idea

838
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:36,480
of integrating into an appropriate university with academic activities that would resonate

839
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,640
with the Institute's mission so who was supportive of that but he died before the discussions

840
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:48,880
were the Oregon State University had really matured we had lots of people coming to the Institute

841
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:55,040
presenting different options to us ideas about you know what they would do in the Institute should

842
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:01,760
we transfer funds to them and the name and so on and so forth and there was one fellow who was a

843
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,360
relocation specialist who had contacted me who had a lot of contacts with universities around the

844
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:16,000
country and thanks to his good graces we initiated discussions with university administrators in

845
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,320
Wisconsin and Boston University at Oklahoma and a lot of different places to find out if there was any

846
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,760
interest in the Linus Pond Institute so all those conversations and to be honest with you

847
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,200
as so many things were happening in that short period of time I can't really place everything

848
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:39,600
chronologically but polling was certainly aware of the desire that the board had to keep the

849
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:45,200
Institute going and say working tribute to his ideas in North America and the medicine and there

850
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:51,120
were different options being discussed one for instance was I think this was brought up by one of

851
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:56,720
our trustees maybe what we should do is just closing Institute down liquidate everything and take

852
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:02,960
that money and establish a chair in Linus Pond's name at Caltech or Stanford or someplace like

853
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:09,440
that that would be most meaningful to Linus Pond so those there were lots of different possibilities

854
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,920
that were that were pretty seriously discussed at those days but financially you had a couple

855
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,320
pretty big gifts that came and then basically kept you about water for a little while that's right

856
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:27,520
and that's right and that really improved the probability of securing the interest of an academic

857
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:33,040
institution too because one problem that we confronted with lots of universities was that they just

858
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:38,480
didn't have a lot of vacant space they can space doesn't exist in the University environment I mean

859
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:46,640
it's subsumed by departments or units right away so there wasn't a lot of existing space

860
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,520
in any of the universities that we talked with where we could just waltz right in and make ourselves

861
01:31:51,680 --> 01:32:02,640
at home and people have different impressions of the of the reputation of the Institute so you know

862
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:07,840
there's there are always people that believe that Pauling was flaky with the Vitamin C and

863
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,520
North Molecular Medicine and there were probably institutions that shared that attitude as well so

864
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:23,920
we recognized that any institution who was looking to gain the Linus Pond Institute would also be gaining perhaps

865
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,560
a little bit of a risk as well and the litigation you know had been covered in the papers so

866
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,800
you know it was a difficult time there was no question that it wasn't a you know a perfect

867
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:41,280
organization with a stellar medical scientific record that was coming in with no stains you know

868
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:48,640
there were some problems image problems perhaps so we were concerned that that would be

869
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:54,880
make it very difficult for people to be you know to warmly receive the Institute so the money

870
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,120
really improved the probability because when you can bring money while suddenly

871
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,840
University of Administrators can see much more potential if you're bringing some money with you

872
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,400
okay who was wrong at the next time thanks to you
