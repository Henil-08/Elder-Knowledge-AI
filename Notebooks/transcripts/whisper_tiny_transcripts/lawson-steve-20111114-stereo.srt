1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All right, Steve Lawson, we're here in a room at the Valley Library, it's the 14th day of November, 2011.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so today we will principally be talking about the Institute at OSU as a couple of things.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I wanted to pass on sort of a past analogy of our talks that we didn't actually get to.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the first is an important question.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think that's if you can sort of trace how you advance into the ranks of executive officer,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then to the executive officer of OSU.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sure, that was quite a surprise.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I think in our last conversation, I outlined some of the financial problems that the Institute had been chronically experiencing,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and these go way back to the 1970s, where staff was asked to take pay cuts and the contribution to the retirement plan

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
was decreased periodically for a set period of time.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So employees in the Institute would know strangers to financial hardship.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the salaries were not very competitive, fairly low, probably when you compared salaries to roughly equivalent positions in academia,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or in the private sector in that time.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But I think people had a great passion for the UN as part of the Institute, which is why I work there, certainly,

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
really felt strongly about the mission, and I really like Linus Pauling.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The more I found out about him, the more I liked him, then I was very pleased and kind of honored to be part of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And as my skills developed in science, and I started to get involved in more and more projects, I found it very challenging and lots of fun.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I think I demonstrated some aptitude, or I don't think I would have been asked by Pauling and others to participate at the level I was asked.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then in the mid-1980s, Emil Zukicondo, who succeeded Art Robinson's President Director of the Institute, was getting very interested in using the relatively new technique called two-dimensional polyacryl and my gel electrophoresis to profile proteins that might distinguish

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
tumor cells from primary tissue, from metastatic tumor tissue.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we set up a laboratory together and started on a fairly productive collaboration.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And as a result of that, I became co-director of the lab for research and gene regulation and reported directly to Emil Zukicondo.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And Emil and I got along very, very well, I really respected him, extraordinarily intelligent person.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can see why his collaboration with Pauling was so successful in the early 1960s.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And as the Institute moved to the point of inflection of the decades, their Emil's tenure was coming to an end.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And as I mentioned last time, Emil and Rick Hicks departed from the Institute because I think Emil was unwilling to make some of the changes that the board felt were necessary to align income without go.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So the Institute had expanded pretty dramatically under Emil's direction and had become kind of a broad molecular biological biomedical research organization.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So it had some areas of orthomolecular medicine, but it also had areas that were really not germane to orthomolecular medicine.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That were of interest to Emil specifically and to others, of course, who were carrying out the specific research project at the Institute.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So when Emil left, and Linus Pauling of course had become sick and was not interested in carrying out many administrative responsibilities.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know Linus Pauling Jr. stepped in to fill an obvious void there.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And that began kind of my long association with Linus Pauling Jr. I got to know him very well and I think we worked together very well as well.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I took care of the day-to-day management of the Institute and Linus Pauling Jr.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
As a result of his experience in wisdom provided some direction to me as well.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think I mentioned last time that when the Institute was going through this reorganization, a fate of different research projects and researchers within the organization was really up in the air and people weren't sure whether they would be asked to remain with the Institute or whether they would be laid off.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So researchers whose work was pretty carefully aligned.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Excuse me.

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
With the newly refocused worth of molecular medical mission,

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I felt fairly confident about remaining when the Institute and others were really anxious, of course.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
At some point there was a board meeting and there were board meetings more often during this period.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The board meetings had been relatively rare during my tenure at the Institute.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was never sure exactly when a board meeting was being held.

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think that they were held probably as often as required by law, but not very often.

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But during this period of change in turmoil, board meetings were quite regular.

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I remember being, of course, I was unsure about my fate within the Institute as well.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because the work I was doing was really not related, specifically to worth molecular medicine.

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So I was concerned that I might be losing my job.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And I was aware of a meal's imminent departure.

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So I obviously was concerned about my future then too.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And it came as a great surprise during a board meeting when I was summoned to the two Linus Plans office where the board was meeting by Dorothy Monroe.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I had no idea why they wanted to talk to me or what I could offer to the board, but nevertheless I went down and met with the board.

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And at that time, they introduced some changes that they had been thinking about and they asked me for my opinion of these changes.

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And on the board in the office there, they had somebody had written an organizational chart for the Institute.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I looked at it and made a few comments and generally thought that I was a good opinion.

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, it was a good idea that they had decided to really make clear the responsibilities within the Institute.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Because it was something that was of great concern to people.

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because the Institute had operated managerially as a bit of a black box and decisions were not always clear.

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The rationale for decisions were not always obvious.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I think that's true in any organization, but in the smaller organization it can be, it can cause a lot of problems.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So during the board meeting, they asked me also, I believe if I was interested in participating in the re-organized Institute.

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And without giving it much thought at the time, I said, yes, I was a bit surprised and also I think a bit flattered by this invitation to assume more responsibility within the Institute.

62
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I thought it was likely to be quite a challenge.

63
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At that time I had no idea how dramatic a challenge it would be, but I knew that it would be stimulating.

64
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And like I said earlier, I like to solve problems and I saw quite a few problems and I thought that I might be helpful in tackling them.

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So you've had a change in some like those from the executive office of the Institute.

66
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right, it went through metamorphosis, initially Linus Pauling had asked me to be, I think the title was assistant to the president.

67
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When he assumed very temporarily the role of president.

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I took that job serious, I didn't really know what it entailed, but I took it seriously.

69
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I started thinking about things that needed to be acted upon at the Institute.

70
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I think I produced a list of some things that needed to be done and my rationale for doing them and gave that to Linus Pauling.

71
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he left for a few months to go down to Big Sur.

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So there was really a bit of a vacuum.

73
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I think Linus Pauling Jr recognized that his father, at that time recognized that his father really had no interest in managing the Institute.

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I was left without much direction at that point.

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've been given a new title, but I didn't really have a firm grasp of what I was expected to do.

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I didn't really feel that I had the authority to do what I thought was in the best interest in the Institute, because I was not chief administrator in the Institute.

77
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So my job title changed when in the board we organized the Institute and asked me to become involved in management from that to executive officer.

78
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I think executive officer has come an old terminology from the military.

79
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And maybe after a year or so as executive officer, I was named chief executive officer.

80
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Was there any significant difference in the power you had or you just want to go into it?

81
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I think it was just a title change.

82
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think it was just recognizing the actual duties that I was performing at the Institute.

83
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because Linus Pauling Jr, of course, was still living in Hawaii.

84
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And he would come to the Institute periodically, sometimes as often as once a month or a day or two.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Excuse me, but I was handling all the day-to-day administrative tasks at the Institute.

86
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And also we had litigation at that time and trying to, we were trying to chart a course for the future.

87
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And all those things I was acting on on a daily basis and thinking about and discussing with my colleagues at the Institute in elsewhere.

88
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I believe he became chairman of the board of trustees and Linus Pauling Sr. at some point became director of research.

89
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Which was a little odd because technically Linus Pauling on the board, the board was responsible.

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I reported to the board, so I reported to Linus Pauling, but as director of research, he also technically reported to me as chief executive officer.

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So it was kind of an odd situation, but it didn't interfere with our relationship or any of our activities because I don't think we'd let titles get in the way.

92
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Another thing that we touched on in our last meeting that I wanted to follow up on real quick.

93
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It was the last one of our foundations.

94
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All right.

95
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mentioned that in the context of some of the case rapidly involved in that.

96
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What we came with that.

97
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
As I mentioned, some of Matthias Ratz activities were unknown to employees in the Institute.

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We became vaguely aware at some point that other organizations with kind of a parallel mission to the Institute were being set up by Pauling and Raff.

99
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And that cost a little consternation because we weren't sure if.

100
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I wasn't in management at that time, but we the employees at the Institute weren't sure if these other.

101
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The organizations were going to be competitive with the Institute, where they're going to compete for funds for the same donors, for instance, or the same organizations.

102
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And at some point it became clear to me that it really wasn't strictly competitive, but I didn't really see the rationale for having independent organizations to carry out this work.

103
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So I believe that Raff and Pauling set up.

104
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The one is putting heart foundation because they were anxious to.

105
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Sort of get around the management of the Institute and carry raise money and carry out clinical trials in.

106
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Vitamin C and heart disease, specifically after a sclerosis and do more investigative work.

107
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Maybe mechanistic work on lysine proline vitamin C and lipoprotein A, which was the main focus of Pauling's research interest at that time.

108
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The North and Milwaukee, the medicine.

109
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But Ratt had as he and Pauling were starting to grow apart because Pauling, I think, was expressing some.

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Decreasing confidence in Raff's behavior and abilities.

111
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Pauling decided to wrap up the line is applying heart foundation.

112
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I believe this was probably after Ratt had left the Institute.

113
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But here was this organization that had an independent life, had headquarters in a small office building in California.

114
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And they're just a few blocks from the Institute and Raff had apparently hired several people to do work there.

115
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So they were on the payroll.

116
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And some of the activities of the foundation apparently were surprised to Pauling because when he was informed about these things,

117
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
he was not pleased about some of the activities the foundation ended to take him.

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So he asked me if I would wind up the line is applying heart foundation and transfer the assets to the line is applying to the science medicine.

119
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
To carry out work and heart disease.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So I told him I'd be happy to do that and said about legally dissolving the line is applying heart foundation.

121
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And taking the physical assets back to the 440 page mail road facility.

122
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And also transferring the financial assets to a restricted account that Pauling is applying to the Institute of Science and Medicine.

123
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, so the last.

124
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
At the end of our interview last time we were at the point.

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In 1994, you received a couple of please substantial gifts that kept the Institute more or less a lot at the end of the week.

126
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And in 1996, the Institute moved to OSU.

127
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So I'm interested in knowing how that process very out.

128
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let me back up briefly in 1994.

129
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was a very pivotal year in many respects not just because of Pauling's death, but it was also the year that we celebrated the 20th anniversary

130
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and we wanted to apply Institute of Science and Medicine.

131
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And we started early.

132
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's see, I think it must have been late spring or early summer.

133
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Maybe it was late spring.

134
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let me see now.

135
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm confused about the year.

136
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Was it 1993 or 1993 or 1993 or 1994?

137
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Perhaps it was 1993 when we celebrated the 20th anniversary.

138
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That would have been the appropriate year at Ringstore House in Mountain View, California.

139
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And that was an opportunity for Pauling to see some of his old friends and colleagues.

140
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We invited quite a few of his colleagues from academic institutions and local donors and friends of the Institute.

141
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And of course, the staff, faculty and staff of the line is playing Institute of Science and Medicine in their guests.

142
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So it was a really terrific event at a beautiful renovated Victorian house that was on the mud flats in Mountain View.

143
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And special collections came representatives of special collections here at OSU.

144
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You came down with some of Pauling's medals and awards that he'd already given to the university.

145
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So they were on display and we had posters, scientific posters.

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And it was really a great time for Pauling to meet and greet perhaps for the last time some of his associates.

147
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And then in 1994, also to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the line is playing Institute of Science and Medicine.

148
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We decided to convene a large scientific conference.

149
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
In the Institute had historically convened a number of conferences.

150
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
One was to honor Bjorn Gordonstrom from the Carolinian Institute.

151
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Pauling became quite interested in his biometric theory of cancer therapy.

152
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Quite interesting.

153
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So there was a symposium to honor him.

154
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And then some years earlier there had been another symposium called Nutrition Health and Peace.

155
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
convened by the Institute.

156
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We presentations by a whole raft of people doing work in North Molecular Medicine and Molecular Biology and Chemistry.

157
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Again, a little bit to honor Linus Pong's work in North Molecular Medicine Science and Peace.

158
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And of course there had been birthday parties for Linus Pong and the Linus Pong, a work for humanitarianism.

159
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So there have been a lot of events throughout the history of Linus Pong Institute.

160
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Some were the fundraiser and focus and some were the scientific focus.

161
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But of course Linus Pong was always at the midst of these occasions.

162
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So we decided that an appropriate 20th anniversary event would be a conference.

163
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A scientific conference organized around the theme of worth of Molecular Medicine.

164
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And Linus Pong was pleased to hear about this.

165
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And we decided to call it the therapeutic potential of biological antioxidants.

166
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And we had a scientific committee and organized committee set up at the Institute that reviewed poster abstracts and invited people to speak at the conference.

167
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I remember going into Paulings Office to ask him what he thought of our provisional title with therapeutic potential of biological antioxidants.

168
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And in his very characteristic way, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes and thought for a minute.

169
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And without even opening his eyes, he said to me, well, I think it's fine.

170
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But we shouldn't forget that molecules like vitamin C serve many functions in the body.

171
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They're not strictly committed to being only antioxidants.

172
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They also have very other important properties.

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And we shouldn't forget that.

174
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And I agreed with him completely, but he gave his blessing to our provisional title for the conference.

175
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So he also agreed to be the keynote speaker at the conference.

176
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And this was scheduled for the fall of 1994, September.

177
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And people like Bruce Aames and Balsfri, Brett Traber, Lester Packer, Enrique Cadenas.

178
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A lot of people in the free radical field were there.

179
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And I hadn't met some of these people before.

180
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'd met Bruce Aames and Balsfri as early as 1989 when they came to the Institute to give a seminar on vitamin C.

181
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because Aames had published with Fry, a paper in PNAS that year showing that out the score bay is the outstanding antioxidant in human blood.

182
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And a pecking warder, it's number one.

183
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And Polly, of course, was very excited by that paper.

184
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And they were invited to come to the seminar and study the day of the earthquake actually as it turned out.

185
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So there were a lot of interesting people invited to speak at our conference.

186
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then, of course, Polly died at the end of August.

187
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I asked Henry Talbe, who was one of Polly's friends,

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and had done work in free radical chemistry as well.

189
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If he would step in as a substitute for one as Polly and give the keynote address at our conference.

190
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And he was happy to do so. That was very gracious of him to consent to do that at the last minute.

191
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Because he was very active at Stanford.

192
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I'm sure there were many demands on his time.

193
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I thought it was terrific that he really rose to the occasion and agreed to give that talk, which went very well.

194
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I drove him up to Tiberon, picked him up at Stanford and drove him to Tiberon that day to give the talk.

195
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And he didn't have standing job really, really thrilled to group there.

196
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So, after Polly had died, of course, and before his death, we were engaged in analyzing options for the future of the institute.

197
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I discussed some ideas with some of the people that had attended the therapeutic potential biologically into the oxenance in September.

198
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And then was approached in 1994, in 1993, 1994.

199
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I was also working with a fellow named Bill Camp, who was introducing me to people in different universities around the country.

200
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And we had been talking, as I mentioned last time, with people in all over the place.

201
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Bill had arranged for me to meet the governor of Oklahoma at the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles.

202
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because the governor of Oklahoma was on a trip, as many governors do, to try to get businesses to relocate,

203
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
or move some of their operations to the state of Oklahoma, because that's the economic engine that drives the state.

204
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So, I met with the governor at the Jonathan Club.

205
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It was kind of a funny meeting that was in a really luxurious room at the Jonathan Club.

206
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And the governor was there with his chief of staff, and maybe a dozen or 14 other people.

207
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They were all paying wrapped attention to everything that he said and did.

208
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
They were all aligned on one side of a long, long conference table, and it was me.

209
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
On the other side of the conference table, I had no people, I had no retinue, I had no advisers, just me.

210
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And I had a great conversation with him, and he invited me and Linus Pond Jr to go to Oklahoma City to make a presentation to the president and the university,

211
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
president of the foundation there, which operates in a similar way to the Oregon State University foundation here,

212
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
with their relationship to the local university or the state school I should say.

213
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But anyway, getting back to more specifically your question.

214
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Other people came and made presentations to our board about their ideas for relocation.

215
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And one of the people who came was John Bern, who brought with him.

216
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I believe you brought with him, Dick Scanlan, who was dean of research at that time.

217
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And Oregon State University, in many ways, I mean, just superficially seemed to be a good fit,

218
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
because Linus Pond was his alma mater.

219
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He'd already agreed to give us, in his wife's personal professional memorabilia, to Oregon State University,

220
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to be housed in a new special collection, this forms her in the nucleus of special collections.

221
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So it seemed like a good fit, but we weren't really sure about the specifically how the institute would work into the program here.

222
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So John Bern and Dick Scanlan talked about the centers and institutes.

223
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There were already extant at Oregon State University and how they were organized and how they reported to and how they were staffed and so forth.

224
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And they talked a bit about the nutrition department and the work that was going on there.

225
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The research size and sports physiology, medicine, pharmacy, biochemistry and bio physics, environmental and molecular toxicology.

226
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Strong programs that seem to have some relevance to the institute's mission.

227
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And that led to, of course, many discussions and meetings between staff at Oregon State University and our staff at the one that's applying Institute of Science and Medicine,

228
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:47,000
including hosting a meeting between a committee that John Bern had put together to seriously analyze this prospect of the institute,

229
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
relocating to Oregon State University, to find out whether it was really a good thing to do or not.

230
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
John Lyon, George Bailey, a number of other people were on that committee.

231
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And they came down to Palo Alto and I hosted them for a day and talked about the mission of the Institute and how we had been funded.

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Historically, talked a lot about the scientific work, a lot about the fundrais and work.

233
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They weren't really familiar with the term orthomolecular.

234
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So we spent quite a lot of time thinking about that and discussing it.

235
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And I think they came to realize that some of the work that they themselves were doing could be considered orthomolecular,

236
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
but they hadn't really applied that term to their own work.

237
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I think as a result of those many meetings that became clear that there was a good fit between the Linus Poly Institute and Oregon State University.

238
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Although it was untenable to bring the whole institute with all its employees up to Corvallis because there was just too many people.

239
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We had, I can't remember what the specific number of employees was at that time,

240
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
but back at before the reorganization, it would maybe 70, 75 people at the Institute,

241
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and then after the reorganization that was dropped down to maybe 50 or so.

242
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And of course, with the Institute moving to Oregon State University, a lot of the administrative functions that we had to assume ourselves in Palo Alto,

243
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
we would no longer have to assume.

244
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So we had no need for a controller, a bookkeeper, or we still had need for fundrais,

245
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but of course the fundraising activities were going to be taken over by the OSU Foundation.

246
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So we didn't really need to have a fundraising staff to come with us to Oregon State University.

247
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So we had broad and deep discussions about all those issues.

248
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And the researchers at the Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine,

249
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
who the Dean of Research and the ad hoc committee formed by John Bern believed had the best chance of succeeding here at Oregon State University.

250
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We're asked to come up and meet the faculty and staff that they might interact with here on campus and the different departments.

251
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And so there were a number of visits between back and forth between OSU and LPSM.

252
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And as a result of that, Dick Scanlon was pretty frank with me about who might really succeed at Oregon State University,

253
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and what might be the most important part of the Linus Poly Institute to bring up to Oregon State University.

254
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And that led to the decision to bring a relatively small nucleus of people about half a dozen to Oregon State University.

255
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Now there were some people that I think could have made the transition had they wanted to,

256
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but they had, for instance, there was one fellow doing work that was supported by a Department of Energy grant at the Institute in Palo Alto.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And his wife was a physician and they had a comfortable life in the Bay Area and they really didn't want to leave.

258
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And the weather people who also were approaching retirement age and decided that it might just be best to retire rather than moved to Oregon.

259
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So there were a lot of factors that came into play in determining who actually moved to Corvalles.

260
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But at the time we had a very, and I mentioned this the last time, a really good,

261
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
contractual relationship with Unilever and Elizabeth Arden that was continuing.

262
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So the people involved with that particular project were given offered jobs at Oregon State University,

263
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and a number of other people were as well.

264
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think there were about half a dozen, six or seven people total.

265
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It was kind of a cavalry who was an Irish biochemist working on the Arden's supported project.

266
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The D. Mivenov, who was working in cardiovascular disease research and his wife, Svetlana Ivanova,

267
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Wahid Rumi, who was doing some really good work in cytotoxic,

268
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
trying to determine the cytotoxic moiety of the vitamin C molecule and some of its derivatives.

269
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Myself.

270
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And that could have been it.

271
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm the only one left. That's right.

272
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Conor McEvely left after the contract supported work expired,

273
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and that contract had a finite start and stop time.

274
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And then the D. Mivenov and his wife Svetlana decided to return to the Bay Area

275
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
because they felt more comfortable in the Bay Area.

276
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
They really liked California quite a lot.

277
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The D. Mivenov had come from the Moscow cardiological institute in Russia and found California

278
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
just a paradise compared to what they left in Russia.

279
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And I think they just had a terrific fondness for California.

280
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So they weren't willing to become permanent residents here in Oregon.

281
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And we'll heed Rumi left after some time.

282
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We had an interim director at the Institute, Don Reed, who I believe at that time

283
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
was director of the Environmental Health Science Center as well.

284
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And a member of the biochemist involved physics faculty.

285
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I was going to ask you about leadership.

286
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, so he was providing some leadership.

287
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
We, one of the first things that we did together was to hire an office manager.

288
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We hired Barbara McVickard. I believe she was the first employee.

289
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Actually, the first employee was Oberthias, who was selected by the Oregon State University Foundation

290
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to become our fundraiser.

291
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So I work quite closely with Ober and the very early days in a prize in him

292
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
of some of our fundraising history.

293
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Telling him a little bit about some of the contractual relationships we had

294
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that generated income from the Institute and also some of the charitable foundations

295
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and philanthropies who had been very kind to the Institute over the years

296
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and talked to him about some of our big donors and be quests and so forth.

297
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I worked pretty closely.

298
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oberthias had been coming down to Palo Alto to go through some of our fundraising files

299
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
as well to help him identify what was important to bring up to Oregon State.

300
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And of course, one of the most precious resources that was transferred was our donor database

301
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
because Oregon State University, I think, recognized that absent large government grants

302
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it was going to be tough to keep the Institute going without reliance on the contract we had

303
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
as ardent and unilever and also sustained giving by our donors.

304
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So that was very important to keep that safe and to cultivate the donors

305
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and that began even before we moved here.

306
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So what sort of commitment did OSU make the Institute identify person?

307
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, the commitment was really spelled out in a document that we wrote jointly

308
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
called the Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed in 1995

309
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
by Linus Pond Jr. myself, Paul Risser, who was the incoming president of Oregon State University.

310
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It really spelled out how the Institute's assets, including financial assets, fundraising assets,

311
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
physical assets, and personnel would be transferred here to the campus of Oregon State University

312
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and the Oregon State University Foundation, and how the Institute would go through legal dissolution

313
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and also the expectations for what the University would provide for the Institute in the future,

314
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
including, I think, a really key phrase about launching a capital campaign to secure a building

315
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
for the Institute as soon as that was feasible.

316
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So right from the get-go, there was always the promise of a building for the Institute

317
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
because on any university campus spaces that are premium,

318
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and I'm not sure who had been in the departments.

319
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think Bob Chemistry and Bob Physics may have been in the initial space that the Institute

320
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
occupied in Weniger Hall, but in 1995, after the Memorandum of Understanding

321
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
had been executed and renovation of this space on the fifth floor in Weniger Hall was undertaken,

322
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I would come up periodically to work hard with Dick Scanlan and others on the details and logistics

323
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
of the move from Palo Alto to Corvallis, including an analysis of the laboratory requirement.

324
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So these laboratories were renovated, they were painted, the wood was stiffed up and polished and sanded

325
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and new countertops were installed, air conditioning was installed because these old labs in the middle

326
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
of the building didn't have air conditioning, building wide air conditioning.

327
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And there was an area that was the south part of the fifth floor of Weniger,

328
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
which was renovated for LPI.

329
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
There were still offices in laboratories there for other departments, oceanography and atmospheric sciences,

330
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
to name one, and some other people were still scattered throughout that space.

331
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So it wasn't a contiguous LPI space from the west and around to the east end,

332
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but it was certainly satisfactory for the Institute's initial efforts here at Oregon State.

333
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So the furniture, the laboratory equipment, centrifuges, laboratory supplies, chemicals,

334
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
paper, journals, a lot of the material from Palo Alto and Palo Alto was all transferred up,

335
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
moved up in August of exceeding July of 1996.

336
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And that was a very, very difficult process because we managed to move ourselves.

337
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We had professional movers, of course, we hired to make this move,

338
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
but we had to make lots of decisions in Palo Alto about what should be moved and what shouldn't be moved,

339
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and what could be recycled and what could be thrown away and so on and so forth.

340
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So we filled up two dumpsters a week for well over a month,

341
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
which is junk that we had no use for in the future.

342
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then of course everything was packed securely and brought up here at Oregon State University.

343
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And a lot of the journals and laboratory equipment that wasn't in use,

344
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
immediately, was stored in the sixth floor of Weniger, and with some storage on the fifth floor as well.

345
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And then over time, especially after Boltshire was recruited as the director of the Linus Poly Institute here at Oregon State,

346
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and following that, because I think I mentioned once before that when the candidates for director,

347
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
that in dad position, came to interview on campus,

348
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I think they all asked the University administration the same question,

349
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
which is, what are you going to do to provide for growth for the Institute,

350
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
how will the Institute grow?

351
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I think the University to its credit responded satisfactorily to those questions,

352
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
by offering to set up a couple of faculty lines and start up packages for in order to recruit new faculty.

353
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So that was also something that was an incentive and recruiting a good director

354
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
that we would have the ability to grow the Institute built in to the initial program.

355
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So as Wen Boltshire assumed that position,

356
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and we set about recruiting new faculty,

357
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
the material that had been stored in the fifth floor had to be moved.

358
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And at that time, a lot of the filing cabinets that stored Polling's files and manuscripts and stuff

359
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
were moved over here in special collections, excuse me.

360
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And a lot of the other stuff that we perceive no need to keep old journals,

361
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
for instance, that the library couldn't use, and we really had no need for

362
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
or storage capacity, physically and when are there or were recycled.

363
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So the University did commit this along with funding,

364
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
then it wasn't just an issue providing space in saying the floor.

365
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We have a foundation representative, and I'll be raising money,

366
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but we'll, for what will you do to bond by funding the floor?

367
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, in the memorandum of understanding that ongoing funding to provide startup packages

368
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and salary lines for additional faculty, that was not part of the memorandum of understanding.

369
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That was something that developed as a result of feedback from interviews

370
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
for the director, among the director candidates.

371
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And to be honest with you, because I had not had professional experience

372
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
within a university environment, nor had lines upon junior,

373
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
nor had the other members of our Board of Trustees with the exception of a couple,

374
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
it wasn't something that we anticipated.

375
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So, had we anticipated that we really needed to secure a mechanism at that time

376
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
to grow the institute.

377
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We probably would have incorporated that in the memorandum of understanding,

378
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
but I think that was an issue that escaped the analysis at that time.

379
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It was only later that that was really addressed.

380
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But the idea for a building from institute was there right from the beginning

381
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
because we recognized that the renovated part of when a girl was not going to be sufficient

382
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
should the institute be successful.

383
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That wasn't going to be big enough to hold the institute.

384
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And we thought that having our own building would be really a

385
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
fitting tribute to one is falling.

386
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And I think John Bern and people at Oregon State University agreed

387
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that that was important.

388
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It sounded like President Bern was crucial to this process

389
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
happening in the first place within the office,

390
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and we're running around and working with his perspective as well as in the community.

391
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, Paul Rissard didn't have much to do with it mechanistically

392
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
because he signed the memorandum of understanding,

393
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
because by the time that document was generated,

394
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
John Bern was leaving his president.

395
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So, Paul Rissard was the incoming president.

396
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I think there were a lot of press releases that about that time as well.

397
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So, Paul Rissard had to respond as the new face of Oregon State University

398
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
about this move of the one that's playing in the institute and so forth.

399
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But his scientific training I believe was as a botanist.

400
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So, he probably had less appreciation for Pauling scientific work

401
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
than maybe people in the other biological sciences or in the physical sciences

402
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
like physics and chemistry.

403
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He certainly was aware of line as Pauling,

404
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but I think this was basically John Bern's baby.

405
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And Dick Scanlan at that time assumed a really pivotal role,

406
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
a very important role in helping the institute to integrate into Oregon State University.

407
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So, Paul Rissard was certainly aware of everything

408
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and very supportive of everything,

409
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
but did not play a really pivotal role early on.

410
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It was really Dick Scanlan.

411
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It was working very hard in this area.

412
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What were you doing in this one question that we did at Rissard?

413
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Well, I'll be frank.

414
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
My initial impressions were not great.

415
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I had spent my life in the East Coast near Boston

416
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and at Stanford near San Francisco,

417
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
which was a hive of activity, intellectual, cultural activity,

418
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
academic activity.

419
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So, it can value here virgin during my time there.

420
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So, it was a very dynamic and kind of thrilling

421
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and overstimulating type of environment that I'd grown to love.

422
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So, coming up here to Corvallis.

423
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Corvallis struck me as a very sleepy town in those days.

424
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Didn't seem to have a big bookstore in town.

425
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Didn't seem to have many movie theaters.

426
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Didn't seem to have a lot of good restaurants.

427
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And to be honest, it surprised me.

428
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Because here's a college town with tens of thousands of students

429
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and a lot of faculty who were very bright and energetic.

430
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I was surprised that that kind of energy

431
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and intellectual dynamism, which I'm sure existed here in campus,

432
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
didn't translate into more that I could perceive in town.

433
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So, nevertheless, I felt that this was the best option for the Institute

434
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and I felt compelled from a professional standpoint to work very hard

435
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
to ensure that the Institute was a success.

436
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Because, like Linus Paul and Junior, we didn't really want to see this fail

437
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and see what could become a really successful working tribute

438
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
to Linus Paul and turning into a disaster.

439
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So, I felt personally and professionally committed to making this work.

440
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And I realized that it was probably imperative for me to become part of this process

441
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and moving from California to Oregon, at least initially,

442
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to get the Institute up and running and make sure that everything was

443
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
happening appropriately and that we didn't really lose sight

444
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
of the reason that the Institute existed in the first place.

445
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Namely, the study of worth and molecular medicine.

446
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I was a little surprised at kind of the Perocule,

447
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and kind of provincial attitude of some of the faculty here at Oregon State,

448
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
nutrition and so forth.

449
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It seemed to be a little old fashioned to me.

450
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But I thought the Institute would probably settle in and do quite well.

451
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And there were a number of faculty who were extraordinarily bright

452
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and excited about the Institute being here,

453
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and they were the ones that we were going to be working with.

454
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So, I felt very good about that.

455
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But I was concerned really about my own personal satisfaction here in Corvalle.

456
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I mean, I know that the ocean is an hour and a half away

457
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and the mountains are an hour and a half away.

458
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And Portland is an hour away.

459
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But everything's at least an hour away.

460
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And in Palo Alto, I was very right in the midst of things.

461
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
San Francisco is a short train ride, half hour by car at that.

462
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So I was concerned about that.

463
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Corvalle has changed quite a lot over the years as well.

464
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Do you mention Dick's talent?

465
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Dick's talent was an important early ally.

466
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Was it important in terms of being made to prevent rate it?

467
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I think George Bailey was very important as well.

468
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
He was an environmental and molecular tax college,

469
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and director of the Marine freshwater biomedical sciences center at the time.

470
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Using trout as a model to study carcinogenesis,

471
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and he'd been part of this committee that had been set up by Dick's kin

472
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and John Burns to sort of investigate the Association of the Institute

473
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
with OSU.

474
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Also Chris Matthews, who is the chairman of the department

475
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of biochemistry and bio physics, I think, played a very important role.

476
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And part of the reason these people were important was that new faculty

477
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
coming into the Institute, which was essential,

478
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
were going to have their academic homes in different departments

479
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
across campus, and maybe even in different colleges across campus.

480
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So it was very important for the Institute to be well integrated

481
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and be close to these departmental chairs and deans,

482
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
as well.

483
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
John Leon plays a very important role early on in Tim White.

484
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I think was involved as well.

485
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I can't remember all the people who constituted the search committee

486
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
for the director, but a number of those people were also on the search committee.

487
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And we took that job extremely seriously and reviewed numerous applications

488
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and wittled the field down to a number of really outstanding candidates.

489
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And then set about presenting each member of the search committee presented to candidates.

490
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And the choice was overwhelming for Ballsry, which was terrific.

491
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Also Phil Wanger, who was, I believe, an environmental molecular toxicology

492
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
working on selenium at that time.

493
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It was also someone who was closely associated with me as a student.

494
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The higher ball is, but I expect you to have a relationship moment.

495
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It really was.

496
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Hiring Ballsry, who was working, of course, on vitamin C, was very strategic.

497
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
He's a terrific scientist.

498
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
He had terrific recommendations from Bruce A.M.,

499
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:56,000
who was a national academy, a science member, and winner of the...

500
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What is the award that Paul Engut from Gerald Ford?

501
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The National Medal of Science, winner as well.

502
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Excuse me.

503
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So Bruce A.M.s recommended him extremely strongly.

504
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And Balls had had...

505
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We knew him as well, or at least I had known him for a few years,

506
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
since his parents to give a seminar at the Institute back in California.

507
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And he had, after leaving, Bruce A.M.s lab as a postdoc.

508
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It Berkeley, he'd gone to Harvard, had a position there,

509
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and was currently at Boston University School of Medicine,

510
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
doing work on vitamin C and atherosclerosis.

511
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So we felt that it would be terrific for the Institute to get him,

512
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
because we would ensure central importance of worth of molecular medicine,

513
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and coincidentally, when a Paul Engut's favorite molecules vitamin C

514
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
would have a very prominent place in the Institute's research,

515
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and Ballsry would be a really terrific director.

516
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And then with the faculty lines and startup packages,

517
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
created by OSU, the research office,

518
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I think that really was an exciting time,

519
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and that really showed that we now had a mechanism for moving forward.

520
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We weren't going to have to be completely dependent on fundraising

521
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
from our donors in order to make the Institute a success.

522
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Now we're going to be able to bring in high caliber faculty

523
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
because of these faculty lines.

524
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And when those people were recruited, things were always started to,

525
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
of course, progress pretty dramatically.

526
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So you're letting your hired Tori Hagen, Merit Trader, and Rod Dashwood?

527
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's right.

528
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So the backbone of research back on the links that you don't figure

529
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and out as you know.

530
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's right.

531
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's right.

532
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That was very, those were all very good decisions.

533
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Tori now is director of our Healthy Aging Program,

534
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Rod Dashwood is director of the Cancer Chemical Protection Program.

535
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Rod had been here previously to work with George Bailey many,

536
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
many years ago, and is one of the leading researchers

537
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and phytochemicals and cancer in the world.

538
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So that was a very important part of our research program.

539
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And Merit Trader, coming up from UC Berkeley from Lester Packers Lab,

540
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
one of the world's authorities on vitamin E.

541
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So we thought that the combination of Tori Hagen,

542
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
working on AG Central Micronutrients, Rod working

543
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
in phytochemical protection against Carson Agenesis,

544
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and Merit working in molecular mechanisms of vitamin E,

545
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
another very important physiological antioxidant,

546
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and then balts for eye working on vitamin C,

547
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
would really constitute a great attack in some of these problems

548
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
that had interested in line as part.

549
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I think it's probably safe to say that.

550
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I think balts impressed all of them.

551
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Of course Merit Trader, new balts already from their

552
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
prior association at UC Berkeley.

553
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But I think his acumen and abilities in energy

554
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and reputation as a scientist were really critical

555
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
in attracting these other candidates who were hired.

556
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And that there are these four people's ability to successfully

557
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
attract trans-configure them through this.

558
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's right.

559
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That's right.

560
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's always been a consideration, a major consideration

561
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
for becoming a principal investigator in the Institute

562
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and being selected from the enormously large pool of qualified candidates,

563
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
the ability to support a research program through NIH,

564
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
or NCI funding, or independent funding,

565
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
is can't be understated, and it's absolutely critical

566
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
to be considered for a position like that.

567
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And to achieve success in that kind of funding

568
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
on a regular basis, I think, speaks very well

569
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
with a caliber of any candidate who's selected for that position.

570
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
David Williams, when I actually wrote that.

571
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
David Williams was doing a very good work here

572
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
in environmental and molecular toxicology,

573
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and also had a assumed directorship

574
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
of the Marine Freshwater Biomedical Sciences Center.

575
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So he also was very interested in photochemical protection

576
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
against Carson and Genesis, which fit right into the Institute's mission.

577
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And he's been a principal investigator all this time as well.

578
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
He was not recruited extra merely.

579
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He was at OSU George Bailey, of course,

580
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
continued to remain as a professor at OSU

581
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and just retired a few years ago.

582
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And I think within very fortunate that none of the faculty

583
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
we've recruited has left for a better job

584
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
any place else, so I think it shows that the Institute

585
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
has become a collegial and productive home for people

586
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
where they feel good about their ability

587
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to carry out their research programs,

588
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and like their colleagues.

589
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
At some point, the Institute changed its name

590
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and the line is calling into the science medicine

591
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
to just want the Institute to work to comment on the reason why.

592
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, well that's kind of the two organizations overlapped.

593
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So the Institute as a five on one C3 incorporated

594
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
in the state of California was known from 1973 or four on

595
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
as the Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

596
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The Institute as it exists here at Oregon State University

597
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
has always been known as the Linus Poly Institute

598
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and was independent from the Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

599
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
When the Institute moved here,

600
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
we transferred, as I said, our financial assets, physical assets

601
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and some personnel to establish the Linus Poly Institute

602
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
at Oregon State University,

603
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
but the shell organization continued to be viable

604
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
in the state of California for actually quite a few years after that.

605
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And there were a number of reasons for that.

606
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
One reason was we wanted to continue to be

607
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
the recipient of bequests that names

608
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
specifically the Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

609
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And there were a couple of bequests in the offing

610
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
in which the executors and attorneys handling the estate

611
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
weren't sure that they could recognize Oregon State University

612
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
of the Oregon State University Foundation as the successor

613
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
to the Linus Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

614
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So we thought rather than imperial any of these large bequests

615
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and there were several that were quite large

616
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that it would just be best to continue that shell organization

617
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
that could be recipient of some of these funds and bequests.

618
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
There were also legal issues that needed to be tied up

619
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
to its litigation with Rexie Gerawala

620
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
about wrongful termination that needed to be resolved.

621
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And there were, let's see, mainly financial and legal issues

622
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
that were still dangling.

623
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, everybody in California, as I might have mentioned,

624
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
was at Will that was employment status.

625
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And it's very popular and playing with the same

626
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
organization.

627
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And it's very popular and playing with the same organization.

628
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It would have been nice to offer people long-term contracts,

629
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
but it really was not economically feasible to do that.

630
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
We're prudent because the Institute had no reliably safe source

631
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
of chronic funding.

632
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
We didn't have an endowment and, as you know, as you're well aware,

633
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
the income was up and down over the years.

634
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And it was a great opportunity for us to be able to

635
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
continue that policy.

636
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
But it really was really no way to move to any other kind of policy

637
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
at that time.

638
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But it mainly benefits the employer, not the employee.

639
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And I feel terrible about continuing that policy.

640
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But there was really no way to move to any other kind of policy

641
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
at that time.

642
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And I think that's a very important thing.

643
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's a very important way to move to any other kind of policy

644
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
at that time in Palo Alto.

645
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And of course, the Linus Poly Institute of Science in Medicine

646
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
really had no absolute influence on which employees

647
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
from that organization would be offered jobs

648
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
by Oregon State University.

649
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So the Linus Poly Institute of Science in Medicine

650
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
was not making job offers to its own employees

651
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
to come to Corvallis to take a position.

652
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
The Linus Poly Institute University was making those offers.

653
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So when it became clear which staff members in Palo Alto

654
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
would be offered jobs and which weren't offered jobs,

655
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
then the people who were not going to be offered jobs,

656
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
some had made a decision, some resigned made a decision

657
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
that they didn't want to go to Oregon anyway.

658
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And some were laid off.

659
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The Federal Reserve Waterwall of Intern sued the Institute

660
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
for Wrongful Termination.

661
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And that was another one of the zazz standing.

662
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Excuse me, litigations that was a reason

663
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
when the Institute could not go out of business right away.

664
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So there was an old, there was a period of overlap.

665
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
There was Linus Poly Institute, here at Oregon State University.

666
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And there was a continuing Sheller organization in California.

667
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Institute of Science and Medicine. Another reason was that we had entered into a contract with

668
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,680
Arden and Unilever, and that contract with the Linus Plan Institute of Science and Medicine.

669
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,520
So there were lots of complicated legal and financial issues that all of us agreed seem

670
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:03,720
to be resolved by just keeping the Institute a shell organization until all these loose ends

671
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:14,760
could be tied up. And then that finally was achieved about 2005, 2003, 2005. I can't remember

672
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,360
the exact year, but that's finally when the Institute went through legal dissolution and transferred

673
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,440
remaining assets to Oregon State University Foundation. So I served kind of two roles. I served

674
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:33,640
continuing to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of LPSM, and then also the Administrator

675
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,640
of Officer for LPI here at Oregon State University.

676
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:46,520
In 2000, one of your more interesting and successful sort of public outreach efforts for

677
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,400
Secretary of Information Center came online. I wanted to talk about that a little bit. One thing

678
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,840
interesting and looking at it is that by that point, the Institute of Science and Medicine

679
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,240
is definitely back the way from the negative points that I've been seeing since I've been getting

680
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:06,280
40 milligrams of far-cracked employees. I was talking about these active memories,

681
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:12,120
we got left through the conversation behind that. Sure. Well, there's never been a litmus test

682
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,080
for employment at the Linus Plan Institute, even in California, and people have different

683
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,240
behavior as far as supplementation goes. So there are people in California at the Institute

684
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:27,000
who took large doses of vitamin C and vitamin E and multivitaments. There were people who didn't

685
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,600
take supplemental vitamins. So it's never been a litmus test, and nobody has ever been forced

686
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,840
to tell the party line about vitamins supplements. Everybody's free to make up their own mind

687
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:45,880
about what to do and what to recommend and so forth. I think the scientists associated with

688
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,560
the Linus Plan Institute that came on board here in Oregon all had without fail.

689
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:59,080
Chimentus respect for Linus Polling, but probably as good scientists were a little skeptical

690
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:07,160
of the enormous mega doses that Polling advocated and therefore weren't comfortable in recommending

691
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:13,160
these kinds of doses themselves because they either hadn't done the research to convince them

692
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:19,800
that these the magnitude of these doses was warranted in each and every case or, you know,

693
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,440
that's my guess as they just weren't familiar with a lot of Polling's arguments about this.

694
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:33,960
So the Micron Engineering Information Center came about in the year 2000. I think partly as a result

695
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:40,360
of conversations at early retreats and also feedback from the scientific advisory board

696
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:48,120
about the Institute being a resource for peer reviewed, scientifically accurate, and updated

697
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,920
information on the role of micronutrients including vitamins and minerals and phytochemicals and

698
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:59,720
dietary constituents in preventing disease, treating disease when applicable, and also in

699
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,280
taining optimum health. We had an idea somewhat similar to this on a more limited scale back in

700
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:12,360
California where we had talked about becoming a resource for a worldwide resource for vitamin C

701
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,920
information specifically because we had some expertise in vitamin C obviously through Linus Polling

702
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:27,880
and other staff members and we had talked about that if there was some way to become a resource for

703
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,040
that kind of information and again this was before the internet had really taken off so

704
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:39,240
it would have required hiring people with more knowledge about nutrition and molecular biology

705
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,600
and the intersection between nutrition and molecular biology and medicine and we just didn't

706
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:51,640
have the funds to do that at that time and it was also probably not prudent because there was a

707
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,120
lot of uncertainty about the future of the Institute so it would have been full hard to set up a new

708
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:02,200
program only to lose it with the move of the Institute to a new location or the liquidation of

709
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,000
the Institute or something like that so we never acted on that dream at that time but then this

710
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:15,160
kind of resurfaced in a broader sense before the year 2000 and the idea then of course the internet

711
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:23,400
had really taken off to make this an electronic electronically accessible database and we started

712
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,080
thinking about who would be appropriate to set up and manage such a database and we felt

713
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:36,200
somebody with a PhD in nutrition or in molecular biology related to nutrition and somebody with

714
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:42,760
some computer skills would be required to do this so at that time Jane Higden had just gotten a PhD

715
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,960
in nutrition from Oregon State University and was not interested in pursuing a career and experimental

716
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:56,920
science wasn't really interested in securing a tenure-track position in academia but was interested

717
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,120
in staying in the scientific realm so she applied for that position and she was perfectly suited for it

718
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,120
she had had experience as a nurse in New York City that she got a nursing degree from Pacy University

719
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,720
and had gotten an undergraduate degree in biology from Stanford so she was quite smart and had

720
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:19,560
great experience and was willing to take on this task of setting up our marketing and training

721
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:27,080
information center and we also hired somebody to work with her who could do the initial computer work

722
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,040
and software that was required to get this up and running excuse me so the two of them

723
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:42,200
collaborated on this and over the years it's developed into quite an astonishing resource and to the extent that

724
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:51,560
when we thought about updating Pauling's book had a live longer and feel better and this is

725
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,760
something that Pauling himself had pursued back in the 80s and he'd signed a contract with Brian

726
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,760
Leibowitz as a matter of fact to work on an update of how to live longer and feel better but

727
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,960
I think they had a disagreement about the strategy there and the scope of the work and that

728
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:12,600
really came to not but Linus Poon Jr and I were very interested in getting a new addition of how to

729
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,920
live longer and feel better published and we talked to a number of people that we thought would be

730
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:23,960
good candidates including Gladys Block we wanted somebody who was sympathetic to Pauling's ideas and

731
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:29,000
worth them a lot in the medicine but also extremely knowledgeable and kept up with the literature

732
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:36,440
and so forth to find someone to do that who already has a productive research career is really

733
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:42,840
difficult and we weren't able to locate anyone to carry out that work and then with the

734
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:50,120
advent of our micro-neutune information center it occurred to me that that was really an electronic

735
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,600
update of Pauling's book because now we were continuing to stay abreast of all the research

736
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:01,240
information in worth a molecular medicine and instead of compiling into a book it was online

737
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:09,240
so we decided when the prospect of publishing an anniversary edition of how to live longer and feel

738
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:19,320
better came up and I approached Oregon State University press about that we we decided to keep the

739
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:25,880
book intact addbacks some illustrations and other work that had been deleted because when the

740
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:33,400
book went from trade paper back size on nice paper to mass market paper back size on course paper

741
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,840
some of the resolution of the typos lost and some of the illustrations just weren't appropriate

742
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,080
so they were deleted from that mass market paper back edition we wanted to bring those back

743
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:49,640
and decided that the best way of doing this new edition of the book which would be the 20th

744
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:56,360
anniversary edition would be to have a new forward written and afterward kind of put the working

745
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:02,200
context with on the basis of new research that had been done since the book was first published in

746
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:09,480
1986 and also makes some judicious annotations where people that Pauling refers to for instance

747
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:16,040
in the present tense who have died maybe indicate that the people have died or if the RDAs

748
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,880
changed maybe indicate why the RDAs changed or the UL and things like that so we really limited

749
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:27,240
to tinkering with the text to annotations and then providing some more text at the beginning and end

750
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:33,000
of the book and then directing people in the afterward to visit the micronutrient information center

751
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,920
because that really provides an update of how to live longer and feel better and over the years

752
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:46,520
as the number of chapters grew in that micronutrient information center and it became

753
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,040
and was always widely accessible through search engines it's becoming enormously popular

754
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,840
so recently it's been getting on on the order of 20 to 25 million hits per year

755
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,000
and most of those of course are not local there are all over the country all over the world

756
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:15,160
and it's been a terrific resource for people to use in consulting with their physicians about

757
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:20,440
health problems or to find out more about the biochemical or physiological action of some of

758
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:26,600
these important micronutrients the emphasis in the micronutrient information center has always been on human health

759
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,720
so we will revert to discussing cell culture or animal studies when there doesn't seem to be

760
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,760
much human data available but the focus is really our humans because humans are the ones that are

761
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,680
reading this there the ones that are interested in applying this information to their own health

762
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,840
and that's been the focus and the information that has been written by Jane Higden

763
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,920
and she was succeeded by Dr. Victoria Drake and now we have another person working with

764
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:02,920
Victoria Drake on the micronutrient information center, Johnna, Angelo all the articles that they

765
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,640
are sent out to leading experts in the field for peer review and then they're periodically updated

766
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,480
as well to take into account new information new studies that might cause the institute to

767
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,280
modify its recommendations so the end of each of these chapters ends with the one is applying

768
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:28,040
recommendation and in many cases it's very similar to or the same as the DRIs that the food nutrition

769
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,400
board publishes in some cases it's different and in the case of vitamin C for instance it's different

770
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:40,680
we don't recommend the enormous quantities that line is applying recommended in part because

771
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:47,800
pharmacokinetic studies and molecular studies have revealed that the amount of vitamin C absorbed

772
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:54,440
from a gut into the bloodstream is limited by the sodium vitamin C transporters which are

773
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,200
relatively newly discovered they hadn't been discovered by the time Pauling died but they are

774
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:07,320
known now and it explains why only a fraction of a very small dose of vitamin C gets from the gut

775
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,040
into the bloodstream it's limited it's controlled by these vitamin C transporters so it just doesn't

776
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:20,440
diffuse you know against a gradient or something it really is limited so practically speaking

777
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,640
and biochemically it doesn't make sense to take a huge dose of vitamin C because only a small

778
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:34,280
fraction of that will be absorbed so we decided on the basis of meta analyses on basis of biochemical

779
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:42,440
epidemiological studies that it's important to keep bloodloves of vitamin C very high that produce

780
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,840
not really saturation but very high concentrations in circulating cells in the blood and also

781
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:54,520
cells in different tissues because vitamin C is very important and non-toxic so we recommend now

782
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:02,440
to get at least 400 milligrams a day so by saying at least 400 milligrams a day we recognize

783
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:09,000
that it's important to get much more than what the RDA is for instance and we also recognize implicitly

784
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,440
the safety of high dose vitamin C so we don't specifically recommend many grams a day but we

785
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,360
recognize also that high dose vitamin C is very safe as a matter of fact the UL which is the

786
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:30,520
upper tolerable upper level of intake for vitamin C was established in 2000 and at 2000 milligrams

787
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:37,960
per day based solely on the transient laxative effect of higher doses in some people which is really

788
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:47,000
not a serious side effect it's not really pathological or toxic and is the argument in favor of

789
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,480
the intravenous vitamin C in the possible therapeutic procedure that does that still a little

790
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:59,880
of the question well actually that's been greatly reinvigorated by some of these pharmacokinetic

791
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,560
studies after the male clinic studies as we discussed there was kind of a dismissal of vitamin C

792
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:10,280
utility of vitamin C as a therapeutic agent in cancer and a lot of oncologists and physicians

793
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:16,600
became very uninterested in vitamin C's pedestrian molecule it's already been studied by

794
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,840
the male clinic it's failed so therefore it's time to move on however pharmacokinetic studies

795
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:29,400
that really demonstrated very clearly in these transport studies and molecular biology

796
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:43,000
have something my throat showed that when you give vitamin C intravenously you get much higher

797
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,240
concentrations in the blood then you do when you take it orally depending upon the dose given

798
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,600
intravenously you can end up with millimolar concentrations in the blood when you take vitamin C

799
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:01,320
orally it's tough to get above about 200 micromole per liter in the blood concentration so millimole

800
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,600
you're talking about 70 or a hundred times greater concentration of vitamin C when given intravenously

801
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:13,960
and that led people conducting these pharmacokinetic studies to think more carefully about

802
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:20,200
why cameras work with Pauling was so successful in Scotland and why the male clinics work

803
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:27,960
in Minnesota failed and it's pretty clear that these these high levels of vitamin C exhibit

804
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:33,400
cytotoxicity selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells and this has been shown in

805
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:39,240
cell culture experiments for many many many years and even in the early 1980s Pauling himself

806
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:46,600
published with Japanese colleagues a paper showing that vitamin C had cytotoxicity against

807
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:54,280
tumor cells in culture and that this was completely nullified by the addition of catalysts

808
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,480
to the culture medium and catalysts of course quenches hydrogen peroxide so they surmides that the

809
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,400
cytotoxicity was due to vitamin C acting as a prooxinant and generating hydrogen peroxide

810
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,400
which was then killing tumor cells so this very mechanism was then rediscovered many years later

811
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,000
and shown to occur when you get these pharmacological concentrations of vitamin C in the blood

812
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,600
when given intravenously it starts generating hydrogen peroxide which attacks tumor cells and it seems

813
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,400
to be very selective either normal cells are protected by endogenous antioxidants or some other

814
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:33,640
protective mechanism as it play and that led to renewed interest in the prospect of using

815
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,720
high dose IV vitamin C as a junctive therapy and cancer and there have been many many

816
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:47,400
anecdotal studies published case histories published in a couple of phase one clinical trials published

817
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:53,160
as well so I think there's quite a lot of interest now but there are also quite a lot of issues

818
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:58,760
that need to be much more fully characterized for instance which types of human cancer are

819
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:05,800
most sensitive to these high concentrations of vitamin C which patients are the best candidates for

820
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:14,360
high dose vitamin C at what stage of cancer can vitamin C be given with chemotherapy

821
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:20,680
of drugs in a synergistic manner would vitamin C negate the effect of some types of chemotherapy

822
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:27,480
of drugs should it be used in connection with radiotherapy and what would be the optimum

823
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:35,480
protocol for administration of vitamin C for instance Cameron you with his terminally

824
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:41,320
old patient population these people were hospitalized waiting to die so he could give continuous

825
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:48,440
slow drip intravenous vitamin C high dose vitamin C hour after hour day after day so

826
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,840
retrospectively you're thinking about this and thinking that hydrogen peroxide must have been

827
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,840
rather continuously generated and rather continuously attacking these tumor cells in vivo

828
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,640
for many patients now who get high dose IV vitamin C it's given in a periodic fashion two

829
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:15,080
or three times a week for a high doses so hydrogen peroxide is being generated transiently

830
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:21,400
and then after four to six hours the level of vitamin C in the blood is right back at baseline

831
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:28,040
no more hydrogen peroxide generation presumably so those kinds of issues whether it's okay to

832
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:35,240
have periodic generation or hydrogen peroxide through a kind of intermittent IV vitamin C use or whether

833
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,440
this continuous generation hydrogen peroxide is more effective all these issues are very

834
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:46,120
nuanced and difficult and I think have to be really thoroughly characterized before will

835
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:53,960
really understand the merits of vitamin C against cancer but there are people that are actively

836
01:12:53,960 --> 01:13:01,560
working in that area and they recognize all these issues in 2001 against the two hosts of its first

837
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,680
diet and not coming to health conference and that also came with the first health guidance for health

838
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:12,200
research which is a $50,000 price pretty remarkable turnaround for an organization that was

839
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:19,960
either have a break going out of business really amazing turnaround and part of that has to do with

840
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,240
I think Rick Hicks cultivation of donors over the years by always putting information about

841
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:32,360
bequest and plan gifts in the periodic newsletter that went out to our constituents so people were

842
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:39,560
aware from the mid 70s on and named the Institute in their wills and those bequest that came in

843
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:47,400
very irregularly and unpredictably to the Institute allowed us to do really wonderful things including

844
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:53,240
a doubt endowing new faculty positions within the Institute convening things like the diet not

845
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:59,320
them of health conference and giving that prize for health research and also the the fact that the

846
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:05,080
cost of doing business here at Oregon State was much less because we weren't having to pay rent

847
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:12,920
any longer we weren't having to pay people to participate in a large fundraising program or pay

848
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:18,360
a controller and bookkeeper and so forth so a lot of the activities that had to be supported

849
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:23,640
as an independent organization did not have to be supported in this context of Oregon State

850
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:30,040
University so costs were were down and therefore the bequest in the money that was coming in could

851
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:36,200
be could be applied towards growth of the Institute instead of just merely sustaining the Institute.

852
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:44,680
Also in 2001 Joe Beckman arrived at the Institute talking over about the background behind that

853
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:50,520
and the fact that he is working ALS into sort of opening up a different angle research for the Institute.

854
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:56,360
That's right there always been interest of course in neurodegenerative diseases at the Institute and

855
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:04,600
we were looking for a candidate who could open up that new area of research and Joe Beckman was

856
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:11,240
one who applied and he'd done some really outstanding work on molecular work on ALS in Birmingham,

857
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:18,200
Alabama at the University of Alabama. Showing that proxy nitrate is a very interesting

858
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:24,680
destructive molecule that is generated through the evolution of nitric oxide in the body

859
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:32,840
very damaging molecule so his work really appealed to us reactive nitrogen species was kind of a new

860
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,280
avenue of research reactive oxygen species work of course have been undertaken by many

861
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,800
people all around the world for many years including some at LPI but reactive nitrogen species was

862
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:51,560
kind of a new a new facet of this that would be very interesting pursue and he was given the

863
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:59,160
a the hell in Pauling in dad position because we thought it would be would be nice to honor

864
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:05,720
Linus Pauling's wife with another with the second in dad position and at that time we had the

865
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,920
money thanks to be quests in order to do that and also some of the money that came into the

866
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:18,600
Institute at that time was not just from the quest but also from legal actions as an example

867
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:26,280
when the insurance companies refused to reimburse us for legal expenses during the

868
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:34,760
wrath litigation I decided to sue the insurance companies because they weren't honoring our claims

869
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:41,720
and they made up reasons why you know they couldn't honor the claims but nevertheless or

870
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:48,040
commercial liability and directors and officers insurance I thought would apply and that was

871
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,400
shock that they refused honor these claims so we decided to sue them and that was settled before

872
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,920
going to trial and that resulted in quite a large amount of money coming to me as to as well so we had

873
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,360
money coming in from a number of different avenues that allowed us to adapt these positions

874
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,120
It took a couple more questions we talked about the principal investigators and balls

875
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,040
I wanted to do any of their folks that have been making the years and the last 10 years

876
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:25,480
or so I'm sort of trying to have to do well I think clearly the people who were operating the

877
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:33,320
research office were have been very important because ball supply reports to the head of the

878
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:38,360
research office and the money is that are available through returned overhead and through

879
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,720
through the research office have been very important to me as to do it over the years

880
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,120
the deans and departmental chairs have also been extraordinarily important

881
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:57,480
because when candidates are being interviewed and reviewed for faculty position within the

882
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,400
institute as a principal investigator institute they have to have an academic home as well

883
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:10,760
which means that the chairperson of the appropriate academic unit in his or her colleagues and

884
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,320
faculty members have to vote on whether or not this candidate were fined into their department

885
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:23,160
so it's a very convoluted and entwined process of selecting someone for the institute and for

886
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,040
an academic department so although the departmental heads have been quite important as well

887
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,320
that was your job change everything

888
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:39,080
well my job has changed in so far as I obviously am no longer the chief executive officer in

889
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,880
the line is pulling us to the science and medicine which was kind of a parallel track for me

890
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:49,800
and once that was finally legally dissolved and I didn't have to think about that any longer

891
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:56,360
basically could focus on my responsibilities as administrative officer for the institute

892
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,680
and from the when we first moved here I took over editorship of the newsletter because we

893
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:08,520
recognized that the newsletter continued to be an important educational tool and fundraising tool

894
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:15,400
from the institute and I thought I could do it and and Don Reed thought I could do it so I just

895
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:22,600
started to do that unilaterally and that's been a lot of fun we have historically given out

896
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:30,760
pilot project grants to fund initial research by people doing work related to the institute

897
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:37,240
of the mission in order to allow them to obtain enough data to apply for larger more sustaining

898
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:43,640
grants from say NCI or NIH and the work that they've done has always been reported in the newsletter

899
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:49,720
so talking with those people getting asking them for articles for the newsletter editing those

900
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:58,440
articles trying to translate that information from a very technical language to language it's

901
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,960
a little more friendly to the casual reader has been a lot of my responsibility and then of course

902
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:11,320
pursuing this option of a new building for the institute has been something that Paul's Ryan had been

903
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:17,080
working on right from the beginning very diligently and then when the funding finally came together

904
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:23,160
for that even before the funding came together we spent quite a lot of time talking to architects

905
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:28,520
and visiting buildings and so forth trying to get a clearer idea of what it was we wanted

906
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:35,960
and also to provide us with material that could be shown to prospective donors so we wanted to have

907
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,960
a good idea of what the institute could look like with the new building could look like

908
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:49,000
and have something that we could show to people a visual representation of this a model or something like that

909
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,600
so he and I worked very closely on not all that work and I became a member of the steering committee

910
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,880
for the Lines Pong Science Center so I'd say for the last couple of years two or three years I've been working

911
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:09,000
very intensively with user groups trying to identify issues that needed to be incorporated

912
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,720
into the design and given to the architects to design our building and also there's always been

913
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:21,880
a bit of a fundraise and component to my position as well because I have such a long history

914
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,720
with the institute and I know about a lot of our past activities and I knew line is

915
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:32,680
calling pretty well I'm often asked by our fundraiser or other groups the rotary club

916
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:39,400
blinds club different groups here at Oregon State University and elsewhere to give talks on

917
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:45,160
Pauling or worth a molecular medicine or to provide overviews of the research that's going on at

918
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:52,680
the institute now and I rather often in two or three times a year travel to scientific or medical

919
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:58,920
conferences to make presentations on Pauling or with a molecular medicine and to give those kinds of

920
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:20,680
updates well it's just such a terrific change for the institute one of her as I said was completely

921
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:27,320
satisfactory in the early days for the institute but as the institute grew we became very fragmented

922
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:33,880
because we had faculty in different buildings all over campus and it became less and less likely to

923
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:40,520
interact with fellow faculty who were part of the institute and of course I think that decreases

924
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:49,000
the collegiality and also diminishes the prospect for good meaningful scientific interactions on a

925
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,160
frequent basis that could generate new ideas and make progress and research projects so

926
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:02,120
the new building has allowed almost all the institute principal investigators to be housed together now

927
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:08,200
Joe Beckman is still in ALS but it's just a stone's throw from the line is point science center which is

928
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:14,200
next to Nash which is the building that sits between ALS and the line is point science center so he's

929
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:20,920
still physically very close to the institute all along not part of the building itself and being in a very

930
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:30,760
spacious well lit modern building with open lab space and modular space that's quite flexible

931
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:37,480
is just such a such a wonderful inspiration for everyone in the interaction with your colleagues

932
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:42,760
now is dramatically increased as well because all the offices are aligned along the north wall

933
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:48,920
on the third floor in the fourth floor and there's an open atrium kind of a cathedral

934
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:55,480
esque environment between the third and fourth floor a staircase in the middle there allows people to get

935
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:01,160
from one floor to the other so there's just this feeling of openness and integration that is really

936
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:07,560
wonderful now you've received this milestone is building what now is the next set of priorities

937
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:14,680
what's the problem with the next set of priorities I think are to expand and develop our

938
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:20,680
micometrine information center also work on a new program in our outreach which is called the

939
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:28,600
healthy youth program which is trying to introduce the concepts of good nutrition and lifestyle

940
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:35,000
among elementary school children and middle school children so that kids can get a good

941
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,560
idea as about how to stay healthy when they're young in terms of exercise and eating well

942
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:48,040
and also we still have the ability to recruit more faculty for our healthy aging program

943
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:54,360
once we recruit more faculty for our healthy aging program I think we'll be saturated with respect to

944
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:00,760
four principal investigators per area having labs in the one as pong institute

945
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:08,120
four that's the end of my questions are there any things we didn't cover that come to mind

946
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:13,320
off and if we should talk about inspired by the Institute there it was you were afraid of that

947
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:20,440
it's gonna like be bad in this question probably but I can't think of anything off here and so let me

948
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,440
think about that
