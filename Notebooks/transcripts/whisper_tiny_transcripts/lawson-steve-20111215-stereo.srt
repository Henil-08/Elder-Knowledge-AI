1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My third these days.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we are going.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All right.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So I have been all the other species yourself.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Steve Lawson.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today's date is December 15, 2011.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're in a conference room at the Valley Library.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Steve.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So today we're going to do something a little different from past sessions.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What we're going to do is essentially this go through a list of names of people that

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
are working at the institute or work related to something else.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ask you these first give your recollections as to rules.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They play needs to do things.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They're not going to actually do anything.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And a lot of these folks that people request on over the course of our podcast are ready.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then that's it.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So the first one is.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Zell Kerman joined the Institute.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I believe in the late 1970s.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He had had an academic position in Stanford University.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And had come I believe from New York City prior to that.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And worked very closely with Linus Pond on theoretical problems in structural chemistry.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
To the best of my recollection early on.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He also had a strong background in statistics.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So he helped people at the Institute with biostatistical analyses.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I believe participated in the analysis of some of the data that you and Kerman was generating.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cancer mortality data with vitamin C and cancer studies in Scotland.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In the mid to late 1980s, Linus Pond came up with an idea for novel fabrication technique for superconductive material that was different from the prevailing ceramic work that many people were doing.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And Pauling approached Zellok in myself to set up laboratory in Stanford Industrial Park to carry out some experiments to confirm his ideas about the way that this material could be fabricated.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That would be in support of his patent application.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So Zellok and I set about buying the furnace and blow torch.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We had a facility already at Porter Drive when we were just using a few rooms in this facility.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And Zellok came up with an ingenious way to collect this material, which is essentially consisted of very thin tin fibbles that were clad in borosolicate glass.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And the glass surrounded the tin at the point of maximum temperature over a furnace, helped the course by a blow torch.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We needed to collect these long strands of tin encased in glass.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And Zellok came up with a terrific idea, which was kind of a bicycle frame upside down mounted on a wood platform.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then we could, the entire tires on the rims, they were just bare rims.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The idea was that we could make this a continuous operation.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
One person would be at the furnace, wielding the blow torch, melting the glass at a very steady rate.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Very controlled, very steady, very exact precise operation.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And then as that glass was melted and the tin was melted, it would be collected onto the back tire of this bicycle frame.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And then somebody, the other person, Zellok, or myself, would be there threading the glass onto the wire rim of the bicycle.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then engaging the pedal mechanism to collect the glass on the bicycle wire rim.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And it worked quite well.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And Zellok and I maintained a notebook, according to Linus Plunk standards, that was countersigned by a music, a music, a music, a candle.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Either at the end of every day, or at the end of every week, so that a third party un-involved with the experimental work could testify that they had read it and understood it.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I got to know Zellok pretty well through that whole process.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And of course he'd been at the Institute a very long time.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
His tenure there, almost exactly coincided with mine.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't recall if I got there a little before him or a little after him, but I know that he arrived from the late 1970s, mid to late 1970s.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I got to know him very well over the years and really respected and admired and liked him as a person.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think he had the desire to devote his career to this relationship, scientific relationship with Linus Pauling.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I think that Linus Pauling depended on him very greatly for this work that he himself might have not had time to do.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And Zellok was able to talk with Linus Pauling about some of these more abstract problems in theoretical chemistry that the rest of us at the Institute probably were not able to convers easily with Linus Pauling about.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Zellok, when the Institute was wrapping up its activities in Palo Alto, and I have to say that Zellok was very important in that whole operation.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He had become the Institute's safety officer over time.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So he worked very carefully and closely with Palo Alto Fire Department, with our hazardous materials plan, which we didn't really have prior to Zellok taking that position.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And he also helped me a lot by kind of serving as my surrogate when I was away from the Institute.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That time I was chief executive officer, and when I was gone, Zellok very kindly and effectively offered to stand in for me and solve problems as they arose at the Institute in my absence, which was he did a terrific job of that as well.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And Zellok also participated very closely in the analysis of the closure of the Institute hiring the moving firm disposal of furniture, laboratory equipment, chemicals and so forth.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He was involved in that whole process very, very thoroughly in a day-to-day basis in the last years of the Institute.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The Institute was not in a position to secure employment of LPISM employees at Oregon State University.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So there have been a number of visits by Oregon State University faculty and administrators to the Palo Alto facility to talk with our scientists there about whether or not they were interested in coming to Corvallis to become part of Oregon State University in the last years.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And whether it would be a good fit for those candidates in Oregon State University academic units.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So Oregon State University ended up not offering a position to Zellok to the best of my recollection.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And after that he did some work I believe for Stanford and some other faculty in the Bay Area and also did some teaching in the Palo Alto Public School System I believe and maybe elsewhere.

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was not involved in compiling or editing or managing that project but they did an outstanding job.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Zellok is very, very meticulous. He has a very keen eye for detail. He'd make a good editor.

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And he was driven to make sure that this collected papers to Linus Paul and the inventory of these papers was as thorough and complete as possible.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So he worked very closely with Dorothy on that project and of course Linus Paul as well because Paul himself had to provide some reprints of some papers that were quite old and weren't part of the Linus Paul Institute.

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So that was a really terrific project that Zellok and Dorothy did jointly and of course that was sort of the nucleus for a project that was then taken up by special collections here at Oregon State University and then expanded to this five volume set that was recently published.

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dorothy was a terrific person. She had been at the Institute I believe nearly from its inception.

77
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And she worked ostensibly as Linus Pauling Secretary but that term doesn't really do justice to the comprehensive nature of her duties and responsibilities.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She assisted Linus Pauling in all his travel arrangements, managed his calendar for appearances, prepared his manuscripts to be submitted for publication of different journals, managed his correspondence.

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And also transcribed his numerous dictifone dictation belts.

80
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So she played a very important role in Linus Pauling's life keeping everything straight and organized and really providing personal and secretarial and managerial assistance to him.

81
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I think that she was invaluable. I don't think he could have managed without Dorothy Monroe.

82
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dorothy was an interesting person. She was not very extroverted, maybe a little skeptical, but I really enjoyed her. We had some good laughs and mainly our humor was based on sort of cynical takes on Institute of Affairs.

83
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But she, when she found something funny, she was really prone to some hilarity, but it took a bit to get over that threshold sometimes.

84
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Richard Hicks had been at the Institute when I joined. He was a former stock broker or administrator with, I believe, Merrill Lynch.

85
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is that correct?

86
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I have to check on that. It was a big stock brokerage, and they had a big office in San Francisco.

87
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And Richard Hicks, first of all, had died of cancer, and that had stimulated his interest in what Pauling called Orthomolocular Medicine, the Prevention and Treatment and Disease with Micronutrients in particular by the Ministry.

88
00:10:34,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And Rick joined the Institute probably in the mid-1970s when Art Robinson and Linus Pauling and the Board probably became convinced that we needed some, it's a managerial experience and direction at the helm of our fundraising efforts, which at that time included contact with foundations, philanthropists, large donors, people interested in Linus Pauling's work, as well as a mailing list.

89
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That provided a base for solicitation for the Institute.

90
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So Rick kind of organized and managed all that, and also was very engaged in certain travels with Linus Pauling that had a fundraising aspect.

91
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So he traveled with Linus Pauling quite often on 70s and 80s.

92
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He did, you know, there have been a couple of conflicts at the Institute.

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
One involved Pauling Hicks and Art Robinson, which led to Art Robinson's departure.

94
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And Art, I believe at some point, wanted to fire or try to fire Rick Hicks and he was prohibited from doing that expressly by the Board and Linus Pauling, which led of course to this administrative conflict that led to arts departure.

95
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are other reasons for that, of course, but that was one element of that conflict that arose in the late 1970s.

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then when he meals up to Condo became president, director of the Institute after Robinson's departure, Rick Hicks worked very, very closely with a meal over the years to try to find financial funding for the Institute's research activities and our educational activities as well.

97
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The two of them worked extremely closely, and then of course with Linus Pauling, as his schedule permitted, to seek out, cultivate, and find, to find, and cultivate donors who could support some of our projects at the Institute.

98
00:12:41,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then when the Institute was reorganized after he meals retirement, Rick decided, since I think partly, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think he decided partly because of his long-closed association when they meal, that the time had come for him to resign as well.

99
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And as he resigned from the Linus Pauling's to the Science and Medicine, he was offered a position on the board, so he became a board member of the Board of Trustees of the Linus Pauling's to the Science and Medicine.

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And then also had a position with a meal's embryonic Institute Institute for Molecular Medical Sciences, which was, as I discussed previously, sublyce in space from us in the same facility at 440 page railroad.

101
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, Institute of Molecular Medical Sciences to the best of my knowledge never really reach critical mass.

102
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They had a few employees early on, and then when the zoning change finally kicked in and that building that they were located in a schedule for demolition, I think that was the effective end of that organization.

103
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I don't know whether Rick continued any active role with I am a mass after it lost its physical existence there at 440 page railroad, but Rick has remained a big advocate and friend of the Linus Pauling Institute over all these years.

104
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I talk with him reasonably often on the phone and he comes to visit us in Corvallis during big events like the 10th anniversary party and so forth.

105
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He couldn't make it to the grand opening of the Linus Pauling Science Center, but he sent flowers and he's always been a good friend of the Linus Pauling Institute.

106
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, Emil is quite elderly now, and I think he had some kind of adjunct position at Stanford in one of their academic departments that probably overlap to the existence of IMMS.

107
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But I don't know if he retains any courtesy or adjunct appointment at Stanford any longer.

108
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I think so. He's the founding editor, of course, of the Journal of Molecular Evolution, which is one of the leading journals in that field.

109
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I think he has retired as editor of that journal. He probably remains on the editorial board, but I know his duties with respect to that journal have diminished quite a lot as well.

110
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So he may have an emeritus position on the journal at this point.

111
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Rexie Jerry, while I joined the Institute, I believe from Johns Hopkins.

112
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In the early 1980s, I believe, to head the laboratory of viral carcinogenesis.

113
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And at that time, Emil's plan for the Institute was to expand along the lines in the salt institute in Mahoya, kind of important projects in orthomolecular medicine,

114
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and molecular biology.

115
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And Rexie's work was an example of the work in molecular biology, in particular.

116
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He was interested in herpes virus type 2 in fragments of herpes virus type 2 DNA that could transform normal cells and make them tumour genetic.

117
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So he had a big program that was involved in that research.

118
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And I collaborated with him on several projects. There was a donor named Robert Sabin in Long Island who developed some very interesting ideas about fightic acid and cancer.

119
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Fightic acid is an antioxidant that you find in grains and seeds, and it protects the germplasm material in seeds from oxidative damage before germination.

120
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And he had approached either Linus Polymer and Emil's look at some of these ideas.

121
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And then I started talking with him about his ideas.

122
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And we set up kind of a small experimental research program to carry out some cell culture experiments.

123
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And Rexie and I started directly collaborating at that time.

124
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Also, we worked together on using 2D gel technology to profile proteins in rat cells that had been transfected with these herpes virus DNA fragments.

125
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So my developed quite a lot of experience in skill in producing these protein profiles.

126
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And Rexie was very interested in that to find out how gene activity and protein expression changed as a result of neoplastic transformation in these rat cells.

127
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So I collaborated with Rexie on a number of different projects over time.

128
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then of course, in the late mid to late 1980s, as AIDS was becoming kind of a public health crisis in the San Francisco Bay Area New York and some other places.

129
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There was interest in finding out, once HIV had been identified as the causal factor there, the logic agent in developing arc in AIDS.

130
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There was interest in finding out whether or not vitamin C might have any effect on protecting people from dysvirus or have any beneficial effect in people that were already infected with a virus.

131
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So in collaboration with Linus Pauling and Steve Harricke who had been recruited to work in Rexie's group.

132
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They published a paper from PNAS in the late 1980s showing that in cell cultures.

133
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:48,000
To human T lymphocytes infected with HIV, did not develop certain pathological characteristics when they were grown in physiologically relevant concentrations of vitamin C.

134
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And the vitamin C also inhibited replication of the virus, which could be assayed with a number of different techniques.

135
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So the conclusion in that paper, if I remember correctly, was that there may be a combinatorial approach to treating AIDS that would involve AZT, which protects uninfected cells from getting infected by HIV.

136
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Combine with vitamin C, which would inhibit viral replication. So you're inhibiting viral replication and protecting uninfected cells.

137
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And maybe this would be a good therapeutic strategy for AIDS patients.

138
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And that resulted in not any, so far as I can remember, direct collaboration with physicians at San Francisco General, which of course had ward 86, which was a major AIDS treatment facility in the United States.

139
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But people from ward 86 Paul Wolberding and Don Abrams came to the Institute to give seminars on some of their experience in treating AIDS patients.

140
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And of course, a lot of AIDS patients in San Francisco were self-medicating with high dose vitamin C as well.

141
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And the physicians at San Francisco General had some anecdotal evidence that seemed to support some value for vitamin C in this role.

142
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And what did you all end up with?

143
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Rex C was not offered a job by Oregon State University.

144
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I believe he took a job with, it's a research organization.

145
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He had some grants from Pacific Medical Center, I believe, in San Francisco, that were sustaining his research activities.

146
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I think they were transferred to California Pacific.

147
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'd have to think about the name of the facility, but it's a medical research facility in San Jose.

148
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And he took a job with them.

149
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then most recently, I believe he has joined Dr. Rath's research activity, which is located in Santa Clara County, or Santa Clara, California.

150
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So I think that's where he works currently.

151
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I love that costume.

152
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Costa Chao had been at the Institute for a very long time.

153
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
She, again, I believe, was there when I joined in 1977.

154
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She was a chemist who had been hired to do a lot of work with vitamin C.

155
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And of course, Lyme's pond was very interested in biochemical attributes of vitamin C in the body.

156
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There had been a lot of red flags about high dose vitamin C, whether it could destroy vitamin B12,

157
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
whether it would cause kidney sown, excuse me, kidney stones, whether it would reach minerals or amino acids from the body,

158
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
or interfere with amino acid metabolism.

159
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So it'd been a number of concerns about vitamin C for a long time.

160
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And Connie Chao in collaboration with Linus Polling, and she had a small staff to help her as well.

161
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
She was addressing a lot of these concerns about high dose vitamin C.

162
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And she was also doing a lot of, she was directing a lot of work that was geared towards understanding at some level,

163
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
some of the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C.

164
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In other words, if people take a certain oral dose of vitamin C,

165
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
how much shows up in the urine and what is the result in blood concentration.

166
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So she was doing studies like that.

167
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And also, trying to get at the role of vitamin C as an anti-cancer agent.

168
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So in the 1980s, as Linus Polling's ideas about the anti-cancer role of vitamin C developed.

169
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I mean, initially it was post-resistance vitamin C.

170
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It was the main anti-cancer thing for vitamin C as hypothesized by you and Cameron and Linus Polling.

171
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And then, over time, they started to develop some new ideas, which was to involve direct cytotoxicity of vitamin C,

172
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
or metabolites of vitamin C, or degradation products of vitamin C.

173
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So vitamin C would get when it gets ingested in the body, can transform into other molecular moiety that have different attributes.

174
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And part of Connie Chao's research program was to identify some of these breakdown products and metabolites of vitamin C.

175
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And to find out whether they had any anti-cancer effect in cell culture studies and in small animal studies.

176
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And she was quite successful on this and published a number of papers showing that degradation products of vitamin C seem to possess strong anti-cancer activity.

177
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And Chao also did some work.

178
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
She was stimulated by reports from Japanese researchers, Mauritia Morata,

179
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that vitamin C combined with the copper tripeptide had very interesting anti-cancer effects.

180
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And of course, the basis for that involves three radical chemistry.

181
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So that's something that Connie Chao was pursuing as well.

182
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
She was at the Institute until we closed our doors.

183
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And in Palo Alto, and then she effectively retired.

184
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I want to ask you about if you're in Marata, and if you can once you get involved.

185
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They were non-resident fellows of the Institute.

186
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There had been a number of non-resident fellows appointed over the years.

187
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So far as I can recall, they never carried out any experimental work at the Institute's facilities, either a mental park or Palo Alto.

188
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But they had longstanding and far-ranging discussions with Linus Pauling about the effect of vitamin C in viral infection and cancer.

189
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And in particular, I think they're earliest work had to do with preventing transfusion associated viral hepatitis in hospital patients at their hospital and in Japan.

190
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And they showed that by giving vitamin C to transfuse patients, they were able to decrease the incidence of, excuse me,

191
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
transfusion associated hepatitis to almost negligible levels.

192
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And of course, that intrigued Linus Pauling greatly.

193
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And then they also developed an interesting vitamin C in cancer, which involved this copper tripeptide and carried out animal experiments,

194
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:31,000
soul culture experiments, and even some surprisingly clinical work with copper tripeptide and high dose vitamin C typically given intravenously.

195
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And they published a number of papers and monographs.

196
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, more she got, and Marata has remained close to the Institute.

197
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He's been a supporter of the Institute for many years, even since we moved here to Corvallis.

198
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
More she, I'm not sure what's become of him.

199
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't know what his current status is.

200
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't know if he's retired, if he has a job someplace or if he's still writing and carrying out any work in that area.

201
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I know that in the late 80s, in early 90s, perhaps he did become increasingly interested in the beta glucan fraction of metaki mushroom in particular,

202
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but that glucan fraction is also present in other mushroom varieties.

203
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And I think he had done some work in so culture and maybe animal experiments to show that not only did it have immunostimulatory properties,

204
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but seemed to have anti cancer properties as well.

205
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
There's quite a big literature on that mushroom extracts and their anti cancer effect.

206
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But as far as I can recall, none of that took place at the Linus Poly Institute.

207
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It was solely focused on vitamin C at that time.

208
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They did, they did, yep.

209
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I think that one or more of them, maybe more she got also spent some time with colleagues at Stanford University at that time too,

210
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but I can't really recall the details of those associations.

211
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
How about William Abert?

212
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
William Abert had come to the Institute from SRI, which at that time was known as Stanford Research.

213
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Stanford Research, yes, yes, yes, yes.

214
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Industrial, let me think.

215
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, anyway, it had been originally affiliated with Stanford University and then I think became an independent entity.

216
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Which is interestingly where I learned to do cell culture in the 1980s when I set up our first cell culture facility at the facility in Memo Park.

217
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Abert was a physicist or is a physicist who developed the volcano source field organization mass spectrometer that was used in Pauling in Robinson's metabolite profiling program.

218
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So he was constantly developing that, trying to improve its parameters and improve the technology.

219
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That was his primary role at the Institute.

220
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He was also a really great ping-pong player.

221
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We played ping-pong quite often at noon and he invariably beat me.

222
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So he designed this thing.

223
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
He designed the instruments and worked on their technical evolution.

224
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And it was always a bit of a, I won't say conflict, but there's always some stress there between instrument design and development.

225
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And the biologists are biochemists who actually want to use the instrumentation to gain data and then analyze data.

226
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And part of the problem with that relationship is that the physicists always want to improve the technology.

227
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The biologists want the technology to get to a certain acceptable level and then keep it constant and then run lots of samples.

228
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because if you keep changing the technology over time, then the sample analysis changes over time too.

229
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It makes it very difficult from a biological perspective to understand what's going on with some of these things.

230
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It was interesting.

231
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you have anybody like that now?

232
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No.

233
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Is that something that's still around or not?

234
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Well, metabolic profiling, I think what Robinson and Pauling and I can't claim to be an expert in this area.

235
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But I think what they were doing and what they had proposed at that time was really cutting edge technology and cutting edge science.

236
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And I believe that there's a lot of interest in that now that may use slightly different technologies, but nevertheless has the same goal of understanding preventative medicine.

237
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Because the idea there was to try to detect very subtle biochemical changes that would be reflected in body fluids such as saliva or typically urine was used because it's easy to use experimentally.

238
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That might correlate with a predisposition to particular pathological states like cancer and also to use it as a diagnostic tool so that you would, for instance, take samples from hundreds of people diagnosed with a specific disease like muscular dystrophy or multiple sclerosis or a particular type of cancer or even old people versus young people or gender or something like that.

239
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And then look for clues in the metabolic profile run through this mass patrometer that might correlate with that particular condition.

240
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And for instance, if you found in a population of people with this particular type of cancer, a representative or a set of representative peaks on a mass spectrogram that correlated with that condition, and you did not find those peaks in normal healthy people.

241
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Then ostensibly you could use this to check someone's health over time to see whether or not those substances represented by those peaks in the disease state are starting to amplify in the healthy persons profile over time.

242
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And if they are, then you could suppose that there are biochemical events taking place in that person that are leading to cancer.

243
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And if you had that knowledge very, very early in the disease process, the idea would be that you could implement therapy much sooner and probably have a better therapeutic outcome.

244
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So that kind of thinking I think was extraordinarily prescient and way, way ahead of its time.

245
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But the metabolite profile, I mean, they had at one point I think under art Robinson's direction, the idea was to build up a repository of your in samples or blood samples from the innate collected through the VA hospital and other hospitals around California.

247
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And then these samples would be held at minus 80 degrees centigrade for decades and then you would check on these people much later in life to find out what had happened to them.

248
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:35,000
If they develop certain diseases and then go back and look at these samples to find out if they're includes or how these samples or how subsequent samples might have changed to give clues to the progression of these particular diseases.

249
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So I think it was a very interesting program that would eventually stop because of funding issues.

250
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And there were some technical issues as well.

251
00:32:45,000 --> 00:33:02,000
For example, the volcano source, which is where the ionization of these volatile components took place, tended to erode and also material would accumulate on this that could contaminate subsequent sample analysis.

252
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So there were some practical problems with how do you clean this cone between samples and the lifespan of the cone and other issues as well.

253
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And some of those things are what Bill A. berth and his people that took over that project after he will have to work on for years.

254
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Alan Cheetz was at the Institute when I arrived. He was working in biochemistry. He was operating and developing.

255
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Gas chromatography and instrumentation to do this kind of work, the metabolite profiling work, using not just human samples, but with a focus I think in the early days on rodent samples.

256
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Analyzing rodent urine, mouse urine, typically using gas chromatography.

257
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So he was an expert in gas chromatography and worked very closely with Bill A. berth as well as Art Robinson.

258
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And then we developed a friendship and we liked each other and he wanted me to get more involved in some of the work that he was doing in the laboratory.

259
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Alan and I set up some experiments for you and Cameron to check and maybe I talked about this before.

260
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Cameron was very concerned about high dose vitamin C in people who are undergoing chemotherapy because vitamin C can have general detoxifying capabilities.

261
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And Cameron was concerned that chemotherapy is expected to be therapeutic for cancer patients and you don't want to do anything to interfere with it.

262
00:34:46,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And if high dose vitamin C interferes with specific chemotherapy and drug activity, then you don't want to recommend it to people who are undergoing chemotherapy or perhaps you want to alternate it with chemotherapy because chemotherapy is typically given in cycles.

263
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So to get at this question, Alan and I set up a fish toxicology experiment using fingerling trout.

264
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And we reconstituted distilled water with, there's a lot of literature and fish toxicology and how to make experimental aquariums for fish.

265
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And so we followed that literature and we set up some experiments to look at the combination of methotrexate and other chemotherapy drugs alone and in combination with vitamin C on swimming behavior in the fish.

266
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because when fish aren't feeling good, they stop swimming.

267
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So there were ways to actually monitor the movement of the fish in the tanks.

268
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And that was one of the last experiments I did with Alan.

269
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And then Alan was also very, he was very closely involved in the move.

270
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because I think his father had worked as a mover or had a moving company in Idaho.

271
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So Alan was had experience in moving and we handled the move ourselves from the mental park facility to the page mill,

272
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Avenue facility in Palo Alto back in the winter of 1981.

273
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And Alan really took a major responsibility for that coordinated that move.

274
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And also I think worked pretty closely with Emil Sochicondo in design and set up a new laboratory facility at 440 page mill road.

275
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Because we were moving into what had been essentially a battery factory, I believe,

276
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and needed to be reconfigured for our work.

277
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I think Alan played an important role in that as well.

278
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And then eventually he retired.

279
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He became, I think, less interested in biochemistry and more interested in,

280
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
what would it be called?

281
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Physical therapy.

282
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Because his daughter had been born with a genetic defect that caused muscle problems.

283
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So she didn't have very graceful gait.

284
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And Alan became very interested in physical therapy that might help his daughter become sort of,

285
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
have a more normal gait and more normal body actions.

286
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So he eventually adopted that as a new career.

287
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We'll cut down him.

288
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We'll cut down him was a retired physician who I think had spent most of his career in Tennessee at the VA hospital.

289
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Memory service made.

290
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And then had worked at Jackson Laboratory in Maine for quite a long time.

291
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I can't remember exactly why he came to the Institute,

292
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
which was in the, I believe, the early 1980s.

293
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He came and set up a program to look at the effect of

294
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
afflitoxin toxicity on guinea pigs.

295
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And whether that could, they could be protected or rescued from afflitoxin toxicity with vitamin C.

296
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, excuse me.

297
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Initially it was not afflitoxin.

298
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Beta immunopropryanitrol, which is a compound that exists in the grass pea,

299
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
which is a lagoon that people in India and other places consume.

300
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And it has the unfortunate characteristic of causing leg paralysis.

301
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So when you consume the grass pea products made from the grass pea over one period of time,

302
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
you become very vulnerable to irreversible leg paralysis.

303
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So it affects the central nervous system and nervous tissue.

304
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So when you see a lot of the long long ago when you see these kind of archetypal photos,

305
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
the beggars and calcata and so forth.

306
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And sometimes they'd be pulling themselves along on little platforms with wheels, with sticks.

307
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And a lot of those people had succumbed to neurolapherism.

308
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And of course when somebody develops neurolapherism, they can't work any longer

309
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and at least in India in those days they were reduced to begging in the street for money to sustain themselves.

310
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So it was a big public health problem in some regions of the world because the grass pea provided nutrition.

311
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's a lagoon.

312
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So it had some nutritional value and it grows like a weed.

313
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So it doesn't really require any special agricultural practices.

314
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It can grow and dry over lots of water.

315
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So it's something that's very available to people.

316
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And they don't know about the downside of consuming this over a long period of time.

317
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So what got down to them in particular, get very interested in whether or not vitamin C might inhibit

318
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
the development of neurolapherism in people that are unavoidably exposed,

319
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
dietarily to this lagoon that contains the neurotoxin.

320
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So he's had a research program that involved guinea pigs because guinea pigs do not synthesize

321
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
vitamin C so you can control the amount of vitamin C in their bodies very carefully and very easily.

322
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And he would give these guinea pigs the toxin responsible for neurolapherism

323
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and they would develop high leg paralysis, very similar to what happens in people.

324
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And men for some reason seem to be especially vulnerable to this.

325
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And I don't know if that was checked in guinea pigs because I think typically in those kinds of experiments you go for single gender.

326
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You don't want to house male and female guinea pigs together unless you're trying to breed guinea pigs.

327
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So I don't remember whether these were male guinea pigs or female guinea pigs,

328
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
but nevertheless they developed hind leg paralysis when given this toxin.

329
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
However, if you gave them the toxin and co-administered vitamin C, you can completely prevent paralysis.

330
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So if there was paralysis, it was transient.

331
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So that was quite encouraging.

332
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And also there are histopathological changes that can occur in the liver that did not occur

333
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
when the toxin was co-administered with vitamin C.

334
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So vitamin C seemed to be protecting their nervous system and liver is from pathological damage

335
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
caused by exposure to this toxin.

336
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And I think Wolka Dunham was very interested in taking this to the World Health Organization

337
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and trying to get them to do human studies and find out whether this might be a low-cost

338
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
remedy for this public health problem in regions of the world where people eat the grass pea.

339
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If you could allow them to continue eating the grass pea and give them low-cost vitamin C supplements

340
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
would be advice that, you know, go ahead and eat this, but be sure you take your vitamin C

341
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
then perhaps it would be less of a serious problem for those people.

342
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And then I think a little bit later he got interested in an aphletoxin and aphletoxin toxicity in guinea pigs

343
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and how that could be attenuated by co-administration with vitamin C.

344
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He did.

345
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
He stayed at the Institute for a very long time.

346
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
He retired in his wife who were very charming, very very nice people.

347
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And he retired probably and I can't remember exactly when.

348
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Towards the end of our tenure there in Palo Alto.

349
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
John Levitt had been recruited from Johns Hopkins and may have known Rexie Gerowale

350
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
actually had Johns Hopkins.

351
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Levitt was recruited to direct our laboratory molecular-carcinogenesis,

352
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
which again was established by a meal with the idea of expanding the Institute's research into more

353
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
molecular biological areas, rather than strictly worth molecular medicine.

354
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And John was very interested in, again, using this two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein

355
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
profiling technology to understand fundamental differences between normal cells and cancer cells in people.

356
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And he discovered the mutant beta-actin protein, which seemed to be present in most tumor cells

357
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that he looked at, and maybe team lymphocytes as well, but never present in normal cells.

358
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So a lot of his work was geared toward understanding this mutant beta-actin and also he did some transgenic work

359
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and secured a patent with a colleague at Stanford that was commercialized.

360
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
One of our rare successful commercializations of patents.

361
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I think Stanford actually led the commercialization effort there,

362
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but nevertheless the Institute benefited from royalties from Levitt's invention there,

363
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
with a promoter of the mutant beta-actin protein.

364
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
How about Jeffrey Blan?

365
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Jeffrey Blan was recruited to the Institute back in the late 70s from the University of Puget Sound,

366
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
where I think he had been a chemistry professor.

367
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And he joined the Institute.

368
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I think to work both on the metabolite profiling project,

369
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:18,000
more specifically to develop a new project, which was called the nutritional supplement analysis laboratory.

370
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So the idea was to analyze nutritional supplements for their dissolution in the gastrointestinal environment

371
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and also analyze them for purity and to find out if the label represented what the actual ingredients were in nutritional supplements.

372
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And the goal there was to award some sort of certificate or seal,

373
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
kind of like the UL underwriters label or something like that,

374
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:02,000
good housekeeping seal of approval, two products that passed the stringent qualifications.

375
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I think it was an interesting program and again way ahead of its time.

376
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think it was so far ahead of its time that they had a very difficult time finding companies that wanted to participate at that time.

377
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They were selling their nutritional supplements very happily.

378
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And I guess didn't see the need for any kind of competitive advantage that might be gained from this line of this poly Institute nutritional supplement analysis seal of approval.

379
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So eventually that program was disbanded.

380
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He moved on from there.

381
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
He also had a developing career as a public speaker.

382
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And I think it was very interested in writing, lecturing, and set up some businesses in Washington as well.

383
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Here's a Yurka.

384
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yurka did work.

385
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There was primarily related to Amel's interest in molecular evolution.

386
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I don't know specifically what Yurzu's training was as a biologist or biochemist.

387
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't believe he was trained as a chemist, but I don't know what his degree was in.

388
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But he had a very a very robust grant from the Department of Energy to analyze allus sequences and the conservation of allus sequences in DNA and jump DNA over time.

389
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And he became, after the Institute's reorganization, I think the assistant director research would the role ostensibly of helping Linus Pauling when Linus Pauling was absent or

390
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:53,000
providing input to Linus Pauling to make decisions about strategic decisions, about research programs, at the Institute.

391
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And he was offered a job at Oregon State University, but declined to come north because I think his wife was a physician and had a very good practice in the San Jose area.

392
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
They like living there and didn't want to come to Oregon.

393
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't know if he was specifically offered a position, but clearly ost was interested in recruiting him.

394
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Greg Spicer also was someone who was recruited by Amel to work in this area of molecular evolution.

395
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And Greg was working on divergence of different invertebrate species using PCR, which at that time was a fairly new technology.

396
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So Greg and I would help him with some of this work go off in the San Jose Mountains with butterfly nets and collect different dragonflies and damsel flies and other insects.

397
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And then he would run the DNA through the PCR and try to date the divergence of these different species.

398
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:10,000
When the Institute reorganized, Greg was one of the new employees at IMMS.

399
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So he continued to maintain his lab and office in the building at 440 page mill road, but then reported to Amel as part of IMMS.

400
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And after IMMS ended Greg took a position at San Francisco State in the Department of Biology as a biology professor.

401
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And I think he's still there.

402
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I don't know if his time overlapped with crawling, crawling may have left, may have retired before Greg got there.

403
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But I'm sure they had friends in common, colleagues in common.

404
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I did not know personally, I saw him at various events and fundraisers and dinners and so forth.

405
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But I know that he was one of the three founders of the Institute Institute for Molecular Medicine before it became known as the Lenin's Poly Institute of Science and Medicine.

406
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And Dimic I believe was the person who actually provided some of the funds to get the Institute off the ground in the early days.

407
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
There were grants transferred from Stanford, but there were also operational funds that were provided by King Dimic.

408
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And he had been instrumental in a company that later I think was sold to Varian.

409
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Maybe a gas chromatography company or something like that.

410
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't.

411
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I don't know.

412
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Alexander in this week.

413
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes.

414
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Alex was recruited.

415
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I believe to work with Jim Fleming in the aging program.

416
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Sussagawa aging program initially.

417
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Jim was very interested in finding out the role of he chuck proteins in longevity, lifespan in fruit flies primarily.

418
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So he's doing a lot of work with fruit flies and also producing transgenic fruit flies that over expressed certain endogenous antioxidant enzymes.

419
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
To try to find out if they would be more protected against toxic insult and how that would affect their lifespan and things like that.

420
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So Alex was working very closely with Jim.

421
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:37,000
When Jim retired from the Institute to go to Washington State to spook in, which is where he and his family were from.

422
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Alex started working with the TS rat who had then been recruited, of course, to set up the cardiovascular disease laboratory at the Institute.

423
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So Alex began working closely with the TS rat in carrying out that work.

424
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Is she was one of the candidates that was being reviewed by Oregon State University?

425
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
She didn't want to move from the Bay Area.

426
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Her husband was had a good job in the Bay Area.

427
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
As you find out, many people who live in the Bay Area choose to live there.

428
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Not just drawn there by their specific job, but they like living there.

429
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
She was, she certainly like living in the Bay Area.

430
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And when the Institute left, she joined Dr. Ratt's research enterprise in Santa Clara County.

431
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And I believe she still works there.

432
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Fred Stitt, who was someone who joined the Institute in the 1980s.

433
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
He had worked with minus polling at Caltech.

434
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I believe and contributed to some extent on the publication of Nature the Chemical Bond, because I know he's thanked in the acknowledgements of that book.

435
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So I think he had known minus polling for a very long time.

436
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm not quite sure what his role at Caltech was, whether he was there as a graduate student or graduate fellow.

437
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't believe he was on the faculty there, but Fred was a very, very nice guy, very intelligent, perceptive person.

438
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And he helped organize some of the public responses for requests for information.

439
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Because by the mid-1980s, we were really being burdened by letters and phone calls, requesting very specific information.

440
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:40,000
People looking for all kinds of recommendations, questions about whether this should take vitamin C or high dose vitamin E.

441
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It had become not untenable because we felt that we were obligated to be compassionate as responsive as possible, but Fred really helped organize responses to people.

442
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So he was trying to categorize some typical responses and then develop packets that could be sent to people depending upon the nature of their question.

443
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He did a very good job of that as well, and also responded personally to a lot of people.

444
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And then he also became the newsletter editor.

445
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So he worked for at least several years at any of the newsletter.

446
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
He worked closely with Cameron on that topic.

447
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He worked closely with Cameron and with Linus Pollan as well.

448
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Okay, so the rest of the names that I have on my list are the affiliates better than people who are actual employees.

449
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And the first one of those is Martin Cayman.

450
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Martin Cayman, I never met Martin Cayman.

451
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I know that he had a close relationship with Arthur Robinson.

452
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I don't really know much more about his involvement with these.

453
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Did I believe it was on the Board of Associates, I remember correctly, but I never had any interactions with him.

454
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Robert Calfcard was a physician he died a few years ago.

455
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:13,000
He was what might be called an orthomolecular physician who had gained some notoriety for developing the Calfcard prosthesis.

456
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Many people who had had artificial hips implanted suffered because they didn't wear well.

457
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:35,000
The Calfcard actually had the, made the stunning observation that maybe we should actually measure the actual relationship between the hip and the socket that the hip joint sits in.

458
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And from that he deduced that it was not perfectly spherical, which is what most of the mechanical joints were.

459
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It was more ellipsoidal.

460
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So he came up with a new prosthesis that had a much longer biological life.

461
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And he had, I think he'd done some work at Stanford.

462
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I don't know that he got his medical degree at Stanford, but he had been at Stanford in some capacity.

463
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And then had a private practice in incline village, Nevada.

464
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And had been treating people there.

465
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
He became very interested in Linus Pong's work on vitamin C, dating back to the 1960s.

466
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And one issue that Calfcard became focused on was, why much vitamin C do you give to someone to have a therapeutic response?

467
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And none of that was known, of course, at the time.

468
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And the transport mechanisms or the way vitamin C gets from the gastrointestinal system into the bloodstream was not well known either.

469
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
People knew from simple experiments that if you take a massive dose of vitamin C, only a fraction of that gets into the bloodstream.

470
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And then a lot of it gets excreted.

471
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And then a lot just passes through the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted.

472
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But the reasons for all that were very vague and unclear.

473
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
People really didn't have much clear idea of how vitamin C gets into the bloodstream.

474
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So Cameron made the, I mean, Calfcard made the observation that normal healthy people seem to be able to tolerate.

475
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Very variable, but can tolerate maybe a couple of grams or maybe up to five grams and a single large dose of vitamin C before they get the laxative effect loose vowels.

476
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And he observed that the same people when sick could tolerate much, much larger doses of vitamin C before that laxative effect was engaged.

477
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So he decided that that might be a good yardstick or guideline to use in the therapeutic application of vitamin C.

478
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So he recommended to his patients that take as much vitamin C as you can to reach that bowel tolerance threshold effect of that laxative effect.

479
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And then decrease slightly and continue taking those doses of vitamin C until your symptoms are resolved.

480
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And he used that pre-successfully to treat people with flu and the common cold and other problems in his practice and treated thousands of patients with that, that manner.

481
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And he, of course, he became quite close to Les Paul and I think they taught and visited each other quite often.

482
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Well, another very important person that I was doing.

483
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Erwin Stone, of course, was about chemists who had heard Pauling give a lecture in New York City about the merits of vitamin.

484
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:43,000
How Pauling wanted to live a long time because so many fascinating things were happening in the field of chemistry and he really wanted to be around to get excited by all these developments in chemistry and in the world.

485
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And I believe Stone followed up that with a letter to Pauling saying, well, there's no reason why you should limit your expectations for a long life.

486
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
If you start taking vitamin C, I think that you could live another 50 years.

487
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And in that letter in subsequent correspondence, Stone laid out the rationale for the belief that vitamin C might have value in promoting health span and lifespan and decreasing the incidence of age related diseases like cancer and heart disease.

488
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And it would be effective against infectious diseases and so forth.

489
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So Stone had done a pretty good literature review.

490
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And he passed that along to Linus Pauling and Pauling became quite intrigued by his correspondence with Stone and the literature that Stone referred to and himself and his wife, A, would begin taking a couple of grams of vitamin C a day and made the observation that they were no longer getting severe cold as often as they seem to get them previously.

491
00:58:47,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So Pauling became I think convinced that vitamin C had some value and of course this led to vitamin C in the common cold and Pauling's own meta analysis of the clinical literature and his own investigation of the literature on vitamin C.

492
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But I think Stone was really a catalyst for Pauling's specific interest in vitamin C.

493
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I did meet Irwin Stone a few times he lived in San Jose, had some kind of small institutes in San Jose that I think eventually was wrapped up with some help from Rick Hicks and other people at the Institute.

494
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And he came to see Linus Pauling periodically and I did see him at dinners and so forth.

495
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Do you know where they don't make you see vitamin C whispered?

496
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Just where I believe he got them in a car accident.

497
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
He was like, where will they feel themselves with vitamin C?

498
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I think that's right. I think that's exactly right.

499
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Where did that idea come personally?

500
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah, I think that's right, but I don't know why he considered vitamin C at that time.

501
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Because if you have wounds, you need optimum collagen synthesis and vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis or you get scurvy.

502
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So maybe he just put two and two together and decided that for optimum healing of his wounds both bone damage and tissue damage that vitamin C would be really important.

503
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But I don't know that for sure.

504
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I know that another fellow, Hugh Reardon, who was a long time friend of Linus Pauling's and very important figure in the field of orthomolecular medicine and some of the societies that grew up around this concept of orthomolecular medicine.

505
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:43,000
He was a psychiatrist by training and became very interested in vitamin C and cancer and did a lot of clinical work in which he taught Kansas and had a whole center devoted to the development of high dose vitamin C oral and intravenous as a junctive therapy for cancer.

506
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Hugh told me that he initially became interested in vitamin C.

507
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I believe as a medical student when he had a poisonous spider bite and decided he had some irritation and some symptoms from the spider bite and decided to just treat it with high dose vitamin C.

508
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And then he measured vitamin C content in his own urine and even after massive oral doses, vitamin C content and blood, I believe, was extremely low.

509
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So he deduced that vitamin C was detoxifying the spider venom and all the sequelife from the spider bite, you know inflammatory molecules and things like that.

510
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So he became convinced from his own experience again that vitamin C had some therapeutic value that had really not been recognized by conventional physicians.

511
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
No, he was not.

512
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
As a matter of fact, I'm not sure that he was even a PhD.

513
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I'm not sure the hand earned PhD. It might have been an honorary PhD, but I have to check.

514
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
How long are my hand earned?

515
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm in hammer again was a retired physician who had lots of success in the business world.

516
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think one of his earliest jobs was something like I remember correctly and I hope I'm not confusing him with the other philanthropist in New York.

517
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I believe it was Armin Hammer who sold pencils to Russia during Lenin's rule.

518
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Made a lot of money that way.

519
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Seems like an odd way to make money.

520
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But he, I'm not quite sure why he and Lenin's poem became friends, but he won the, or was awarded the one,

521
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
he was awarded the one, he's playing the humanitarian award at one point.

522
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And he came to visit Pauling at the Institute a number of times, and I believe Pauling visited him in Southern California in a number of times,

523
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
that probably it bankwits or honorary dinners and things like that.

524
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So I met him and saw him a few times, but one time in the 1970s, Rick Hicks had a document that needed to be signed by Armin Hammer that day.

525
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So I took a flight from San Jose to Los Angeles in the morning.

526
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Got a cab to oxenil petroleum, which was headquartered in Westwood.

527
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Went up to see Armin Hammer, chatted with him for a few minutes, got a signature, brought the document back.

528
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Had something to eat in Westwood very briefly.

529
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Got a cab back to LAX and flew back to San Jose and returned with the document right in time.

530
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yeah.

531
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Pauling had a relationship with San Jose.

532
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Right.

533
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yeah, it's sacclair, of course, was another physician who had found a lot of success in the business world.

534
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And he, in particular, had become the publisher of medical tribune.

535
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I think sacclair was very intrigued by Pauling's ideas in North Milwaukee, the medicine.

536
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And gave Pauling quite a lot of space to write letters and articles in medical tribune.

537
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And really was, I think he also won the line as Pauling award for humanitarianism.

538
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
My memory served me right.

539
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And he was at some of these dinners and bankwits and Pauling birthday parties and so forth.

540
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And I think Arthur Sackler once expressed to Pauling the desire to help the institute in a very substantial way.

541
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Unfortunately, he died before he was able to put those plans in place or take any specific action.

542
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Frederick Cloner was someone I never met.

543
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm not sure that Linus Pauling ever met him either.

544
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But his work had been published in regional medical journals in the southeast United States going back at blue to the 1940s and 50s.

545
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And Cloner had, I think, on his own, started to work with very high dose vitamin C, typically given intravenously,

546
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:12,000
to treat all kinds of maladies, including poisonous snake bites, spider bites, insect bites, things like that.

547
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And Cloner had become convinced that this had great value.

548
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And the therapeutic response was very dramatic in many cases.

549
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It was written lots of articles for these regional medical journals.

550
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And I think Pauling was very intrigued by his clinical work and the anecdotes that Cloner had about the utility of high dose vitamin C in treating different conditions and diseases.

551
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Arthur Chirkin was a PhD who had some position at the VA hospital in Los Angeles.

552
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And had worked somewhat closely with Art Robinson and Linus Pauling, perhaps in the metabolite profiling program of obtaining samples or something like that.

553
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Excuse me.

554
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And he was on the Board of Trustees, and I think served as the secretary of the Board of Trustees for many years.

555
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
But I only saw him rarely.

556
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Norman Cousins was a publisher of, what was it, Saturday?

557
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Saturday review.

558
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It was a major American periodical who had been diagnosed with maybe ankle-intlossing's ankle.

559
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I can't remember the name of the term now, but it was a nervous condition or a nervous tissue condition.

560
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I believe that was sometimes fatal.

561
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And Norman Cousins became interested in Pauling's work and thought that perhaps vitamin C might have some value.

562
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So he embarked on a self-styled therapeutic regimen that included lots of laughter.

563
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So I think he watched a lot of old movies and TV shows that provided a lot of laughter and also took very high dose vitamin C.

564
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And seemed to recover very well from his illness.

565
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So he and Linus Pauling became good friends.

566
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I didn't know that, but I wouldn't surprise me.

567
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Bruce Aims is someone who Pauling, I think, knew from Caltech when Aims was a graduate student there.

568
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Bruce Aims was friendly with his family and Peter Pauling and Linda Pauling.

569
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And I'm sure had some interactions with Linus Pauling back in those days too.

570
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Bruce became a professor of a professor in the University of California, Berkeley, where he spent most of his career.

571
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
One of the National Medal of Science and developed very importantly something called the, it's actually called the Salmanella mutagenicity test,

572
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
but everybody calls it the Aims test.

573
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And it's a way of using mutant bacteria to determine the mutagenicity of certain compounds that might be present in the environment or in the diet.

574
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And also the anti-muted genetic effect of certain protective compounds or punitive protective compounds.

575
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So he's very highly regarded in the scientific world.

576
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And he also recently, while he did work back in the 1980s on antioxidants.

577
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And in particular, in 1989, I believe, 87 or 89 published a paper of Paul's fry.

578
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:48,000
He's now the director of the Linus Pauling Institute showing that a score bait is an outstanding antioxidant in human blood.

579
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So the body is full of different types of antioxidants.

580
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Some are taken from our diet, like vitamin C and vitamin E and some are synthesized in cells in the body.

581
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And provide endogenous antioxidant protection.

582
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
York acid is another antioxidant that can be produced in the body from dietary factors that are taken in.

583
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And both fry and Bruce Ains tried to evaluate the importance of these different antioxidants and rank them.

584
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And it turned out that vitamin C was by far and away the most powerful antioxidant in human blood.

585
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So that work, of course, appealed to Linus Pauling.

586
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And Bruce and Baltimore invited to come to the Institute back in California.

587
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It was the day of the big earthquake in 1989 and get back to back seminars on this latest finding about vitamin C.

588
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And the importance of its antioxidant capacity and blood.

589
01:09:43,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And Bruce has been very interested in the free radical theory of aging and oxidative damage that might lead one to increased susceptibility to cancer, for instance.

590
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So Bruce compares the free radicals that were thrown off by normal respiration and mitochondrial activity to hits from cosmic radiation.

591
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So these can very definitely damage effect and damage DNA that could make you vulnerable to developing cancer.

592
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So he's been very interested in that and how to protect against that, which includes things like antioxidants and vitamin C.

593
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And then more recently he's developed the triage theory.

594
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And it's kind of extended.

595
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Pauling's ideas in orthomolecular medicine where in Pauling's original paper he talked about a couple of genetic diseases that result in.

596
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
People's inability to metabolize certain dietary compounds and so forth.

597
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And Bruce has extended this to maybe 30 or more genetic diseases that can be remedied by high dose vitamin therapy, including some of the B vitamins.

598
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So it's kind of a logical extension of Pauling's early ideas in orthomolecular medicine.

599
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:25,000
In 2001, when we organized and convened our first diet in optimum health conference, Bruce was the first recipient of the Linus Polynes Institute Prize for Health Research that acknowledged his pivotal in seminal work in orthomolecular medicine and work that resonates with the mission of the Linus Polynes Institute.

600
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And Bruce also has been on the extramural scientific advisory board of the Institute since Baltz Frey was recruited.

601
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So he's had a lot of really terrific critical feedback on the development of the Institute.

602
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And I think it could even be one of his early ideas that led to the specific development of our micro-muchene information center.

603
01:11:52,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Mr. Packer is also a retired professor from UC Berkeley who has written many, many papers and also many books including some popular books on what he calls the antioxidant network.

604
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And Lester has been very interested in some of the more obscure antioxidant.

605
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
He's always been interested very much in vitamin E in particular.

606
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:26,000
More at Treber, who's one of our principal investigators, worked in Dr. Packer's lab at UC Berkeley, much like Baltz Frey worked in Bruce Haynes Laboratory at UC Berkeley.

607
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So they're all, and also Tory Hagen, who directs our healthy aging program, was working in Bruce Haynes Laboratory at UC Berkeley.

608
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So we have alumni from the Ames and Packer Labs, Emily Ho, who is one of our principal investigators also worked in the Ames lab.

609
01:12:43,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So Lester is very interested in this concept of antioxidant network, which refers to the complex interplay between the endogenous and exogenous antioxidants in the body and how they can collaborate and cooperate to protect us from oxidated damage.

610
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So he's interested in things like vitamin E, Lepolic acid, some of the carotenoids, vitamin C.

611
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Superoxide, this may taste catalyzed and all these other antioxidants.

612
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And he's got terrific organizing skills as well, and I believe he probably played a role.

613
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
He may be one of the founders of the oxygen club of California, which holds annual meetings in California.

614
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:38,000
All organized to end this theme of free radical chemistry, and the effects of free radicals and antioxidants on human health and disease.

615
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,000
There is a very close relationship, because many of our principal investigators have been members of the oxygen club for a long time.

616
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And we co-sponsored each other's conferences, and there's quite a lot of collaboration between the oxygen club of California and LPI.

617
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And most recently, as kind of a manifestation of that close relationship, the oxygen club of California donated a very nice bronze sculpture from Christine,

618
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,000
cutting him to the one's point institute, which is housed in our lobby in the one's point science center.

619
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
The last person on that list is Mark Levine.

620
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Mark Levine is a physician, clinical physician, and medical researcher at the National Institutes of Health.

621
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And he's had a longstanding interest in vitamin C, and therapeutic application of vitamin C.

622
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:43,000
He was among the scientists at the NCI and the NIH that convened a meeting that was written up in the pages of science as vitamin C gets a little respect.

623
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And Len is pointing, of course, participated in that meeting, Gladys Block.

624
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
He became a trustee of the Len is pointing us to the science medicine.

625
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Balsri was there, Mr. Packers there, I believe.

626
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And Jera Wallen, Connie Chowman, who attended that as well.

627
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But it was a meeting organized at the NCI to talk about the role of vitamin C in cancer and health and disease.

628
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And Mark has carried out in recent years, while actually beginning in the mid-1990s.

629
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Very elegant, carefully controlled pharmacokinetic studies on vitamin C.

630
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Because there's always been interested in how what happens to vitamin C and what you take it.

631
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Where does it go? How much extra gets into the bloodstream? How does it get into the bloodstream?

632
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So he carried out some very interesting pharmacokinetic studies that helped informed the food nutrition boards change in 2000 of the RDA's for vitamin C.

633
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And he showed, for instance, that oral vitamin C can take as much as you want, but you rarely can get above for the average person about 200 micromole per liter concentration of vitamin C in the blood.

634
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Because the amount of vitamin C that gets into the bloodstream is limited.

635
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And he didn't make these discoveries, but about a dozen years or so ago, discoveries were made about the transport mechanisms.

636
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,000
These molecules that transport vitamin C across cells, they're on the cell surface.

637
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And they determine how much vitamin C gets into the cell.

638
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,000
So the cells that line the epithelia around the intestines have these transport mechanisms on them.

639
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And they determine how much vitamin C gets into the bloodstream from the intestine.

640
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And it's limited. It just doesn't diffuse through. You know, you have a higher concentration here in a low concentration there.

641
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You might say, well, it's just a diffusion gradient phenomenon where it diffuses from the high concentration of the low concentration, try to get equilibrium.

642
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So it doesn't really work quite like that. It may vary very high doses.

643
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That may come into play, but primarily it's controlled by these mechanisms.

644
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And after a more experimental kinetic studies with both oral vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C, it dawned on him that, well, maybe that explains why the male clinic studies failed to show any benefit for high dose vitamin C.

645
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Because they gave vitamin C only orally, whereas Cameron typically gave vitamin C intravenously and orally.

646
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And when you give it intravenously, you bypass these control mechanisms on cells.

647
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And you can get very, very high concentrations in the blood that, depending on the dose, can be 70 or 100 times greater.

648
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Millimole concentrations of vitamin C in the blood that are unattainable by oral vitamin C.

649
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And Mark has since gone on to show in a series of really great experiments, so-culture experiments and small animal experiments,

650
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that these very high concentrations of vitamin C generate hydrogen peroxide in the milieu around tumor cells.

651
01:17:48,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And then the hydrogen peroxide can presumably diffuse into the tumor cells and cause their death by different mechanisms, including interfering with mitochondrial machinery,

652
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and cause in atop poses, they pop causes.

653
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

654
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So where is this line of research this point is?

655
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Why do you use human cells?

656
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Yeah, the line of research is so engaging, and now that we have a better mechanistic understanding of vitamin C and cancer,

657
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
and we have a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics.

658
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
This is led to a number of preliminary clinical trials, phase one clinical trials and be followed up by other clinical trials.

659
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm sure that we'll get at these issues of safety combination with other standard drug therapy,

660
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
because there's some evidence that some of the arsenic compounds that are used chemotherapeutically are potentiated by vitamin C,

661
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
which also tends to decrease the side effects of the arsenic trioxide compounds.

662
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Lots of questions remain, optimum dose of vitamin C, the frequency of vitamin C,

663
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
slow-drip infusion, versus periodic injection a few times a week.

664
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
All those questions really need to be answered, and those issues need to be characterized, much more carefully.

665
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And we really don't at this point have any predictive ability.

666
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So we don't know which cancer patients are going to benefit most from high dose vitamin C.

667
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Clearly, it's not a panacea for all cases of terminal cancer, and there are many people that have not benefited from high dose IV vitamin C.

668
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And that needs to be understood as well.

669
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And interesting, and this all harks back to work that Pauling Publish from Japanese researchers back in the 80s,

670
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:47,000
showing that vitamin C can generate hydrogen peroxide in so-culture experiments,

671
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and that this is what's killing tumor cells.

672
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Back in the 1980s, as I said earlier, that's when Pauling's attention started to focus more on the cytotoxicity of vitamin C,

673
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and degradation products of vitamin C, direct effects against cancer cells, as opposed to hemoral effects, you know, with host resistance.

674
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So I think it's very promising, a lot needs to be learned.

675
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,000
The patient population in Scotland may be quite different from the contemporary patient population in the United States.

676
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And you know, all these, it's very, very complex, and there are a lot of issues that need to be really analyzed and thought about very carefully.

677
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But I think the upshot is that many complementary, so-called complementary physicians are now using high dose IV vitamin C as a junctive cancer therapy.

678
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
But we don't yet have good data acquisition and analysis of all those anecdotal reports.

679
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And I think, you know, people are interested in getting that information.

680
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Well, so there might be some validation that they're calling on in the 30-by-40.

681
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I think there will be validation for Pauling and Cameron.

682
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And interestingly enough, if you look carefully in some of Pauling's writings, particularly after the male clinic trials,

683
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I mean, he and Cameron and others came up with criticisms of the male clinic methodology.

684
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And there were lots of criticisms that were fine criticisms.

685
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:20,000
The fact that the patients had undergone parakemotherapy in the first trial or vitamin C was suspended in the second trial.

686
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And then patients started to die when the vitamins were stopped abruptly.

687
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And there seemed to be fairly high concentrations of vitamin C in the urine of some of the placebo patients,

688
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
which makes people doubt that they were true placebo patients.

689
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So they had a lot of criticism about the methodology, but at least Pauling and I believe Cameron also noted in print that there was a big difference between the motive administration.

690
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And although they didn't have evidence at the time to suggest that IV vitamin C was definitely more effective.

691
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Pauling speculated that this may have some importance.

692
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So I think he was very insightful there as well.

693
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Okay, so people that's the end of my list, I'll ask if there's any other people that you think that they were important to them.

694
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Well,

695
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
we've tested a lot of people at 100 or at 60 degrees.

696
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Yeah, I'd have to finish unpacking my office and look at some of the early employment rosters to see if there were people there.

697
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I knew a lot of people over a long period of time.

698
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And I think we've touched on most of the principles, but clearly there were a lot of other people that worked there because there were, I mean,

699
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
there were 75 or 80 people working at the Institute at different times.

700
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Ed Blaise Dells another one who worked with a lot of data analysis, Steve Burbeck.

701
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,000
There's another person who maybe I should talk about this for just a moment.

702
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I don't know if Steve Burbeck was on your list there.

703
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Steve Burbeck was I think had research experience in audiology or psychology and hearing or something like that, but also had strong background computer science.

704
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:24,000
When we were developing this program of protein profiling and just to give you a brief introduction to that.

705
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:35,000
If you're interested in finding out what differences in gene activity or proteins might be between one type of cell and another, say a normal cell and a cancer cell.

706
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You need some way to quantify or visualize those proteins.

707
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And one way of doing that is to have different cell populations that you're going in petri dishes and say, for sake of example, you have a population of normal cells and one petri dish.

708
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And a population of those normal cells that have been treated with something to make them tumourogenic in a different dish.

709
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Then you can incubate those cells with something like S35 methionine, which is a radioactive isotope of sulfur combined with methionine, which is an amino acid that gets incorporated into proteins.

710
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
These cells in the dish are making new proteins and growing.

711
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:26,000
They're incorporating this radioactive methionine because you're growing them in a normal methionine deficient medium and you replace the normal methionine when it's radioactive methionine.

712
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So now all the proteins that incorporate methionine in these cells now become radioactive active.

713
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So at the end of a certain period of time, you can drain the fluid from these cells, you can collect all the cells, you can rupture them, which is called cell lysis.

714
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And then you end up with a little radioactive cell lysate, and you can separate the proteins in that cell lysate.

715
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It has to be treated in certain ways.

716
01:24:50,000 --> 01:25:04,000
In these porous polyacrylamide gels on the basis of their isoelectric point, which is related to pH gradient, and also on the basis of their molecular weight.

717
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So you do a two-dimensional separation of these proteins under the influence of an electric field.

718
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And you end up with a rectangular gel about half the size of a piece of stationary paper.

719
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And that gel can be dried onto a piece of filter paper.

720
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
So now you've got this gel that contains all these radioactive proteins, dried onto a piece of filter paper.

721
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:36,000
You can put that up against a piece of film and put it in a film cassette in the dark for X number of hours or days.

722
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And you take the film out and you develop it in the film processor.

723
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And if you look at the film, you'll see hundreds or thousands of little spots, the correspond to a radioactive emission from them a finding residue on the proteins.

724
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So then you can, the question is, well, how do you quantify that?

725
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So you've got all these spots of varying intensity in size all over this piece of film.

726
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:17,000
So part of Steve Burbex program at the Institute in Jerry Latter participated in this, and other people participated in it as well, was to develop hardware and software that would help us analyze these films and come up with quantitative information.

727
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So we bought, for instance, a drum scanner, and a drum scanner is simply a device on which you can mount one of these films.

728
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And then it spins around really fast and it digitizes these spots.

729
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So now you've got information in the computer about the position and intensity and size of these spots.

730
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And you can use that to create a pseudo image on a computer screen that corresponds to the, you know, the position of all these images on the computer screen.

731
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And correspond to the spots that you saw in the x-ray film exactly the same.

732
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Only now they can be color-coded for intensity.

733
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And Steve Burbex and Jerry Latter and others develop software programs that allowed us to, to analyze these images very carefully and come up with quantitative information.

734
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Find out whether certain proteins were decreasing in synthesis or increasing in synthesis in these tumor cells or whether new proteins were being synthesized or whether certain proteins being synthesized in the normal cells were suddenly disappearing in the tumor cells.

735
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And to do that kind of analysis in a quantitative way is really complicated.

736
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And Steve Burbex and Jerry Latter and others worked on for years on a program to help us analyze those gels that developed all kinds of really sophisticated algorithms to help us understand and match.

737
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So we had a semi-automated system that would allow us to match spots from one gel to another.

738
01:27:47,000 --> 01:28:02,000
If you have an image for the normal cell proteins and then an image side by side on the computer screen from the tumor cell proteins, you want to be able to match one protein from one image to the same protein and the other image.

739
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And to do that, you need very sophisticated software.

740
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So they spent quite a number of years developing software to help us in that kind of analysis.

741
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So it was a big program actually happens to do.

742
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Not off-hand.
