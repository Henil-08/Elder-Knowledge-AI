1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, if you would just start by introducing yourself, let us know your name, the date, and where we got, I don't know.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm Christopher Matthews.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today is September 2nd, 2011, and we're in the Valley Memorial Library.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, first of all, where are you born and right to go?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was born in 1937 in New York City.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And my father was about to start a medical practice in the Bridgeport, Connecticut.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, we moved from New York very early.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He was stationed with a Navy during the war on a variety of places.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And moved to Seattle in 1944, and the family moved with him after the war.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And my family moved back to Connecticut again, but after three years, they realized they'd made a big mistake leaving the West Coast.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, we moved to Olympia in 1949, and that's what I consider my hometown.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But we're some of your hobby being here going in.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, it was pretty interesting science, obviously.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I had a chemistry set.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And my friends and I used to make rockets and fire them off.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And it became interested in birding a nature study because my grandfather was a professional,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or an anthologist who was cured, or birds at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, we were very much exposed to natural history all my life.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And that's kept on.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was president of the Audubon Society of Corvallas for three years.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, there was a strong family influence in the science, and kind of understand where that early interest in science came from.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, yes.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My grandfather, of course, was an orthologist and a very broadly based biologist.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My father was a physician and his father was a surgeon.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, there wasn't, well, let's say there was both medical and scientific.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's even in our background.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And people who says natural, I guess, for me to have a career in science.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, I did consider medicine pretty strongly.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I had various times.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That was another.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My mother?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She has a degree from vaster in English and actually dramatic production.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And she never got involved in science, but she obviously encouraged what my brother and my sisters and I did.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My brother ended up as a wildlife biologist in retired a few years ago from the University of Washington.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Faculty and the College of Fisheries.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My sisters are all younger, and they, two of them finished college, but they finished in their 30s.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My parents went through a fairly messy divorce.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
One of my sisters were teenagers, and I think this kept them from being motivated to go through college,

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but they were all very bright, and they went back.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And that achieved quite a lot actually.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My youngest sister, among other things, has published three books.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
One of which was described her experience as the winner of the Pillsbury Bake Off in 1998,

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
with a $1 million prize.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a very readable book.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Very interesting.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So outside of your family, were there other scientific mentors or influences in your life?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I guess so.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I hadn't thought very much about that, but not so much toward the hard science.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In fact, the chemistry course that I took in high school is probably my least favorite course,

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
although the teacher, Mr. Gaines, was my merit badge counselor.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When I got the chemistry merit badge in Boy Scout, this is my freshman year in high school,

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and he told me I shouldn't try for it till I was a junior, and I had taken chemistry.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And he helped me through it.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But he wasn't very good teachers.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And the botany teacher, Mr. Burke, also, and the physics teacher,

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Keller, none of them I thought were particularly good teachers,

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but there was enough interest in what I was doing,

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and I guess that provided some motivation.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So it's got something to do with the involvement?

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When we moved to Olympia, we lived in right in town, actually, about two blocks from the state capital building,

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and it was very easy to be in Boy Scouts.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And my parents bought some water from land about seven miles out of town,

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and we moved there to a house that they built in my freshman year,

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and they came much more difficult to be involved in scouting after that.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So although I always wanted to be an ego scouting, I just drifted out of it.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How do you characterize the rest of your high school experience?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, that's an interesting question too.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I had skipped the second grade, so I was younger and smaller than most of my classmates,

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and it took me a while to catch up socially, but I worked pretty hard at it,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and ended up with a very nice group of friends.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I thought that the educational and high school experience was pretty mediocre.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was maybe I was too hard on it.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I worked pretty hard, and obviously did pretty well.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My daughter managed to make it through a Corvallis High in three years,

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and some, when I thought back on my high school experience,

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and maybe that would have been good, but then I would have been two years ahead,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and the catching up socially would have been that much more difficult.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Any asked for it?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I've never been very athletic.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I enjoy doing things, skiing, cross-country skiing,

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and I jog regularly, and then you wouldn't call that athletics,

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but it's keeping a shape, played a little tennis,

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but it never was very good at much of anything in the way of sports.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, so after high school, you went to read college,

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
how did you inside of your university?

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, I was reading an article on the Saturday evening post in 1952,

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
my junior year in high school, and there was an article by Richard Newberger,

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
who later became a senator from Oregon.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And the title of the article was the school for bright young things,

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and I guess that's sort of what I perceived myself as,

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and I never heard of read college before even though we lived just 120 miles away from Portland.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And it looked like a pretty exciting place,

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and it seemed as though it would be bright for me.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And so I applied to read, and I applied to Stanford.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And of course, it was accepted both places,

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and read just so much more convenient, and it was more affordable.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Quite a different, quite a distinction between the two alternatives,

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
because our son eventually went to Stanford, so I learned a lot more about it.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was in that you mentioned being some of this asked by the actor,

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
by the high school read, probably presented a different study.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, actually three of us from my graduating class went to read,

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and one of them, only made it two years,

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the other one, who's been a very strong science student,

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ended up majoring in philosophy and going to law school,

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and also becoming an extremely accomplished folk musician.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He and his wife basically made their living.

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So read was interesting, in terms of the fact that a lot of people went there,

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
moving in one direction and changed directions completely,

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
or underrected them and getting a direction.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There was also a very high attrition rate then,

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
so there were a number of students that went there, underrected,

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and there wasn't much supervision, and so a number of students just dropped up.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I was one of the ones who had a sort of a vague idea of what I wanted to do,

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and basically stayed with it.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What was the kind of life that we did in the day?

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I suppose pretty much like it is today, it was pretty intense and largely,

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but the students knew how to have a good time as well.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The academic environment was very strong.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The courses in liberal arts and social science,

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
all had a very heavy writing component.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So in the freshman humanities course, we had to write a paper every week,

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and then we had an individual conference about every paper with the instructor.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anything, any credit I can take for my ability to write today,

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I owe to recalls, and the science was very strong.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Also, at that time, in the early mid-50s,

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I would say that the science wasn't as strong as it is currently.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We'd like many of the other high quality undergraduate colleges

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
has really made a push for a stronger research orientation

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
in the science faculty, and although we were all required to write a thesis

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,000
when I would say the thesis weren't all cutting edge science.

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's put it that way.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In fact, one of my regrets about read was that I probably took more science

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
than I really needed to, and I should have taken more courses

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in liberal arts philosophy and literature and social sciences than I did.

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But I ended up with the interest in a lot of different areas

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and tend to learn a lot of things through my own reading,

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and that's what college is supposed to be for anyway, I think.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How would you say you're assigned to the interest

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
developed within the graduate?

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, I went there as a chemistry major because probably because of my interest

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that started with the reading about chemistry and playing the chemistry sets

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and so forth, so it was sort of an unfocused interest.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But at some point, I read a science fiction anthology of short stories

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and the stories were grouped by scientific area

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that the science fiction dealt with.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And so there were two or three stories that were listed under biochemistry

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I never heard a biochemistry before and I thought, hey,

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the idea of chemistry that has something to do with biology,

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to have to read these stories and I enjoyed them.

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so my junior year, I took a biochemistry course

157
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and the reading I did both in class and out of class convinced me

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that this was a pretty exciting area to go into.

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
During my sophomore year, I'd wrestled with the idea of going to medical school.

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I had a hard time with organic chemistry, the first term of it

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and the first in the fall term when I saw him over here.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And I'd like to tell medical students or pre-medical students the story.

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I began to wonder if I was bright enough to go into science

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and maybe I should go into medicine instead.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But then the second semester of the main course for majors was quantitative analysis.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I did much better at the end of the year.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I decided I wasn't bright enough to go into science after all.

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But was it that your reading or maybe your high school diploma

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and story about a medical student at the very last point?

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You think that?

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My first herd of line is calling the fall semester

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
of my freshman year in chemistry class one day.

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There was a student who raised his hand to ask a question.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And he said, oh, professor, does what you're talking about

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
if anything to do with the falling theory of resonance?

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And professor, a little more gave him a very respectful answer.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And I thought to myself, I've never heard of falling.

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I guess I'd better learn something about this guy.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then remarkably enough within the next two or three weeks,

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it was announced that the line is falling

181
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
at one of the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So I realized that the student was a little bit ahead of me

183
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
in terms of knowing major scientific teams.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And he said, let me read a letter.

185
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I guess you when I talked about that a few years ago,

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
you all made it described that for the Oregonian

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
published editorial a day or two after the Nobel Prize

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
was announced.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was basically congratulations to a native son of Oregon

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
who went on and achieved their great things.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And one of the Nobel Prize was in the same

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
about his inaccurate thinking and his political association

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
that had led him to have his passport lifted.

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I thought it was pretty inappropriate to bring these political things

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
into at a time when we should be celebrating this person's intellectual

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
triumph.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And so I wrote my first letter to the editor ever.

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And at that time, Reed College was in very bad

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and odor in the Portland area because the Valley Committee,

201
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
which was the House on American Activities Committee,

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
had toured the country in the spring,

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
just before I started college.

204
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And three members of the Reed faculty were interviewed

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and refused to discuss their associations.

206
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And this made a lot of people think that Reed was full of communists.

207
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So when I wrote the letter to the editor,

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I used my home address from Malookia,

209
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which could be seen as being within the

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
readership area of Oregon.

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And then, I guess I clicked the editorial

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and my letter and mailed them home to my mother.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And because my grandparents knew the poems,

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
my grandfather was a member of the American Philosophical Society,

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
which Pauline was also,

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
my mother mailed this to my grandmother,

217
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and my grandmother mailed it to Pauline.

218
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And Pauline eventually sent me a nice sort of note,

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
which pleased me a great deal.

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Pauline's youngest son, Crelon, was a classmate of mine at Reed.

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And then, later on,

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
when I was a graduate student at the University of Washington,

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and my wife was a graduate student in genetics.

224
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Crelon Pauline was doing his graduate work in genetics also.

225
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So Kate and Crelon worked in the same lab,

226
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and we used to see them socially, fairly frequently.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So somehow or another,

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I had a fairly close series of relationships with the Pauline family.

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's a good idea about that.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Can you reflect on the time of Crelon?

231
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Can you reflect on the time of Crelon?

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, he was pretty immature.

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And he had a great sense of humor.

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He seemed to enjoy life a lot.

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He started as a chemistry major at Reed,

237
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and he didn't do very well.

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So he switched to biology,

239
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and it took him five years to graduate.

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So he started graduate school at UW a year after I had,

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and then I think it took him five or six years to finish his PhD.

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But he actually published some fairly important papers

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
from his postdoc, and then later on,

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
when he was on the faculty at San Francisco State,

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
as far remember, he was chair of the biology department there

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
for quite a few years.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And so he was always very likable fellow.

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And he was on sabbatical here in 1980 and 81.

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And he worked with Dick Marita and the microbiology department.

250
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And his then second wife, K-Paul,

251
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and worked in art department as a postdoc,

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
with one of my colleagues.

253
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So we established contact.

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And it was very close.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't know anything.

256
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it was kind of amusing.

257
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This doesn't have any to do with college era.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But during that year that Crelon Pauling was here,

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was called upon to be the organizer of the,

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
what used to be the annual biology colloquium.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not even sure if that's still held.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So I organized the two-day meeting on the organization

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and manipulation of genetic information.

264
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is 1981.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And we had a party for the speakers and the people participating.

266
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And the president, McVicker, was at the party,

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and he came up to me and he said,

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Chris, I'd like to have you introduce me to wine as Pauling Sun.

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I took him over and introduced him to Crelon.

270
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And he backed Crelon into a corner and wouldn't let him out.

271
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And they were talking there for probably 20 minutes.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was trying to think of a way that I could rescue Crelon,

273
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
but it didn't work.

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So did you have any wine as Pauling?

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
With wine as Pauling?

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes.

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Probably the first time I met him.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He came to Seattle for a lecture.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I met him there.

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So that would have been in 1961 when I was a student.

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But then my first month here,

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I started my appointment as chairman of biochemistry

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and bio physics in January 1978.

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And one of the first things I learned in my first week on the job

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
was that I had to get ready for sight visit for our department.

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because the legislature, in the previous year,

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
had made some sort of a budget and order or some kind,

288
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
that there should be reviews of academic programs

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that might involve duplication between Oregon State and the U of O.

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And although the U of O didn't have a biochemistry department,

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
they had the Institute of Molecular Biology and the Head of Biology

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to Harvard and the Chemistry of Harvard.

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The chemistry and biochemistry were getting reviewed.

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And Linus Pauling was one of the outside reviewers that was brought in.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And it was fairly intimidating.

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I had to prepare for a day-long sight visit.

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've forgotten who the other reviewers were.

298
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And then we had a similar experience.

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If we were sight visit, there's a biology department as well.

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I had to organize two sight visits.

301
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I remember the biology site visit.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
One of the site visitors was the Herschel Roman

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
who was professor of genetics at the UW.

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And he used the one that my wife worked for.

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And one of the other sight visitors was the guy named Gordon Lark,

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
who was a Kansas State University.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He was quite a prominent bacterial geneticist.

308
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And when he met with me early on the morning,

309
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he said, Chris, why did you move here anyway?

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And sort of a sort of a wondering what the deal was.

311
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What was the attraction?

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because I had a pretty good job at the University of Arizona before.

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I moved here.

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then later in the day, when I met with him again,

315
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and they had a chance to talk to a lot of other people,

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and learn about Oregon State.

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You don't have to answer me anymore.

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He said, no, I know why you moved here.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So I felt pretty good about the decision I had,

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and I had to move when that happened.

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That gets over the way from line is falling.

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But I met him two or three times when he came to the campus,

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
either for the annual award of the Pauling Medal,

324
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
or for other things.

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Somehow we were brought into contact.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So I probably met him half a dozen times.

327
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Did I ever tell you the story about Pauling and the joke that he told?

328
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
At the Pauling.

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you want to hear that?

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It gets a little bit out of the chronology.

331
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So the three north-western sections of the American Chemical Society

332
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
give the line is Pauling Medal over a year,

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
they jointly.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And there's a symposium on a banquet

335
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and the local moves around from Corvallos to Seattle

336
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
to the Plum and Washington or wherever.

337
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And in the fall of 1979 it was held here.

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And so Pauling used to come to all these.

339
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And after the banquet then he would give a little talk about

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
what he'd been doing during the previous year.

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
These things were always hugely entertaining.

342
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And so the talk that he gave in 1979

343
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and Mrs. Pauling was with him.

344
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He used to a lot of them.

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He said that he was encountering a lot of skepticism about

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Vitamin C and the reporter was interviewing.

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And he said now Professor Pauling,

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
you take Vitamin C, don't you?

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Of course I do real man.

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, then sir, do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your

351
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
state of vigor?

352
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No, go right ahead.

353
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well sir, can you tell me then please?

354
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What did you have your last sexual experience?

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well I looked at him and I said why in 1956?

356
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And he said, well that's terrible.

357
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I said, what's a terrible voter?

358
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And he looked at his watch and said,

359
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
it's only 22-10 now.

360
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay, well feedback to your life.

361
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So we mentioned at Washington and then Seattle.

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How do you make decisions in those?

363
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, that's a good question too.

364
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
In the summer of 1957, I went back to visit my grandparents

365
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
in Long Island and they were very interested in having

366
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
me go to graduate school in the East Coast.

367
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So they took me to visit various schools,

368
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Harvard and Brown and Johns Hopkins.

369
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But one thing that I did since they lived fairly far out on the island,

370
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
they'd arranged a visit for me at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

371
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I met with a biochemist there named Robert Steele.

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And he told me about what he was doing.

373
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And he said, I don't know why you're looking at all of these

374
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
graduate schools in the East Coast when one of the best graduate

375
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
schools in the country is right out where you live.

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And I said what's that?

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And he said by the University of Washington,

378
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it's a new department, but it's really good.

379
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So I figured well, I guess I'd better look at it.

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And so I ended up applying to Berkeley, Johns Hopkins,

381
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and the University of Washington.

382
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And in those days, 1953, 54, no excuse me,

383
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
57, 58, you didn't get flown to the department

384
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
to be interviewed at their expense.

385
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I had visited Johns Hopkins.

386
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I never did go down to the Cal.

387
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But I was home for the weekend and drove up to Seattle.

388
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And the department was small.

389
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It had just seven faculty members.

390
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But they were really nice.

391
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And they represented a nice cross-section of the biochemist

392
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
for that era.

393
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And they all had good records of academic achievement.

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And it was pretty close to my family.

395
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And all living in the state of Washington at the time.

396
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And so I figured, why not?

397
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And worked out pretty well.

398
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, it was pretty on focus when I began graduate school.

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
When my fellow students would ask me,

400
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
what are you interested in?

401
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'd scratch my head and I'd say, well,

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I guess I'm interested in enzymes.

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But I'd like to do some project and enzymes that has potential

404
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
applications in medicine or biology.

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What have you?

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And so we were required to talk to all the faculty about their

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
research and the frankhonicons who was doing work on fully

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
enzymology.

409
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's a fully, it's one of the B vitamins.

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And it's converted to a co-insan, tetrahhydrofolate.

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And tetrahhydrofolate is a co-insan that mobilizes

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
a single carbon functional groups.

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And so these are involved in methylation, for example,

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
methylation of DNA, methylation of certain amino acids and proteins.

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And also, the methyl group of thymineucytides that get

416
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
into DNA.

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And the hodicons laboratory had just recently shown that

418
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the action of methyltrexate, which is a folate analogue,

419
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
used in cancer treatment.

420
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
He was discovered in the 1940s, it's a very potent anti-lucinic agent

421
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that had acted by inhibiting an enzyme called

422
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
dihydrofolate productase that reduces folate tetrahhydrofolate.

423
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I thought this was really interesting.

424
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There wasn't very much known about the enzyme at the time.

425
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But the fact that the enzyme was a target for a very effective drug

426
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
meant that the whole area of folate and zymology had the kind of protein

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
enzyme focused that I was interested in with potential

428
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
applications of significant medicine.

429
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So I went to work with the Harkonocons and it worked out pretty well

430
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
for me.

431
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He was on age of professor.

432
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
One of the other reasons that I was interested in as lab was

433
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that I learned that he'd had several students who managed

434
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
to finish their PhDs in fairly short order.

435
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I was interested in getting my PhD in moving on.

436
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And that worked out pretty well too.

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I completed my PhD requirements in a little under three

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and a half years, which is pretty fast by today's standards,

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
where a PhD is generally a five-year program or so.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, as you, when you were at Harkonocons and work

441
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
in the PhDs, you did that many.

442
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's something you got married, that's what you're asking.

443
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, that's an interesting one too, because my wife was a graduate

444
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
school classmate in biochemistry.

445
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
There were 12 entering students in the class of the

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
class of 1958.

447
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And we ended up as lab partners in the lab course.

448
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then later in the year, as teaching assistants,

449
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
we were assigned together to the, to the reagent room.

450
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It was called the solution room, making up reagents for the biochemistry

451
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
lab class for dental students.

452
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And we were supposed to put in 10 hours a week of effort

453
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
on our TA duties.

454
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And we worked pretty efficiently together.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So I think maybe we worked two or three hours each per week.

456
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And we didn't see each other socially at all at the time.

457
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
She had a bunch of other boyfriends.

458
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And I think we both had the feeling that you didn't get involved

459
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
with people that you saw every day.

460
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But her interests were more biological.

461
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And the genetics department was founded in the spring of 1959.

462
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So she transferred to genetics in our second year.

463
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
One we were not seeing each other every day.

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It became a little bit more natural on the.

465
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And so we got married in the spring of early summer of 1960.

466
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And it's kind of interesting because Kate grew up in Berkeley.

467
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Her mother was a research technician in the virus lab.

468
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
She worked for Wendell Stanley who wanted Nobel Prize.

469
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
First, we're working to back him on Zaykh virus.

470
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And at Berkeley, the virus lab and the biochemistry department.

471
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We're in the same building at the time.

472
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And Kate's mother tended to mother all the graduate students who were on a task.

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So if I'd gone to Cal as a graduate student,

474
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
we've always wondered whether, whether Elsa would have sort of mothered me and

475
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ticked me out of the someone suitable for her daughter.

476
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And would have got us together.

477
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And we had a laugh over that over the years.

478
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But you can only live one life of the time.

479
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We also had your first child as a natural candidate.

480
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Right, that wasn't planned.

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Lawrence was born maybe nine and a half months after we got married.

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And the drank champagne from a glass on our first wedding anniversary.

483
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And so Kate never finished her Ph.D.

484
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And she claims, at various times, I encourage her to do it.

485
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
She worked as a lab technician.

486
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And she also worked when I was at Yale.

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
She worked as a teaching assistant in the department of biology where I was.

488
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And she always claimed that she really didn't want a Ph.D.

489
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Anyway, she loves working in a lab and she's pretty good at it.

490
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But she says she's good at the tactics, but not so good at the strategy.

491
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Get developing a long range line of research and applying for funding.

492
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And that sort of thing.

493
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So I think she's pretty happy with the kind of careers she had.

494
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Was it difficult to sort of make an household and also be sort of going to do a program these days?

495
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, somehow it worked.

497
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I a lot of my fellow students would go back to work in a lab in the evening and I just stay home.

498
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And Kate was very good about after Lawrence was born about seeing that I had a couple of quiet hours every evening.

499
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I don't remember what's sitting around.

500
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
She was still working as a graduate student in a teaching assistant in the genetics department.

501
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Somehow it's going to work.

502
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay.

503
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So you finished up your Ph.D.

504
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You done when you did a postdoc at Penn.

505
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm a little bit like that.

506
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

507
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
By the time I was approaching finishing my Ph.D.

508
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I knew that I wanted to work in a biological system that had more potential for genetics.

509
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I was getting more involved in the biological side of insology than the chemical or biophysical side and reading the literature.

510
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I selected three people whose work I was interested in.

511
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And I wanted to be able to go to a lab where the specific experience that I'd had as a graduate student would be useful.

512
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so Seymour Cohen at the University of Pennsylvania was the one I eventually settled on.

513
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And he was working on bacteria phases.

514
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's your analysis.

515
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And basically in the late 1940s when he started with his own lab.

516
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He'd done what I would call the first biochemical experiments on what happens metabolically during a virus infection cycle.

517
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Using cages model systems for plant or animal viruses, which of course were much more difficult to work with biochemically at that time.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And in the early 1950s he and a postdoc had shown that DNA from certain bacteria phases had a very unusual modification.

519
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And that all of the cytosine residues in DNA were modified by having a hydroxymethyl group.

520
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And then on the mid to late 1950s they'd shown the biochemical basis for this that there were new enzymes that were induced after a virus infection that put on the hydroxymethyl group.

521
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And that phosphorylated the nucleotides that get us at the point where it could be activated and incorporated in the DNA.

522
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So the whole idea that virus infections stimulated new metabolic pathways was really exciting to me.

523
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And this enzyme to put on the hydroxymethyl group had a tetrahydrophobic co-facture.

524
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So it meant that I could bring some biochemistry to a colon's lab that would be, that would be, that would help them out.

525
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Because it was nice pairing. But again, in those days, now we're talking 1961.

526
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You didn't just hop on a plane to visit every lab that you were going to consider for a postdoc.

527
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So I wrote to three people.

528
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I was going to give a paper at the Federation meeting in 1961.

529
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is the Federation of American societies for experimental biology, which at that time included societies for biochemistry, physiology,

530
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
pharmacology, nutrition, and a couple of others.

531
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And it was the big meeting for biochemists to go to.

532
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And so the three people that I was considering would be at the meeting.

533
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I could meet with them there.

534
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This happened very shortly after Lawrence was born.

535
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So I really located that of gratitude and also my mother and Kate's mother.

536
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And my grandmother, who all came in and helped out.

537
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I was able to go to the meeting and meet with them.

538
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And it was kind of amusing because on the first day of the meeting, I met a Seymour Cohen for the first time.

539
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And apparently my major professor, who had sent a letter of recommendation, sent a two-page letter.

540
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I didn't learn this to later.

541
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But the second page of the letter to Cohen had Dr. Boyer's name at the top of the page.

542
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And so Seymour knew that I was considering more than one laboratory.

543
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And he had recently had someone very good who had accepted a postdoc.

544
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And then went somewhere else and said, so almost as soon as I shook hands with Seymour and introduced myself.

545
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
He said, now she here, if I accept you in my laboratory, are coming or aren't you.

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And so it really set me off.

547
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And I'm wondering who is this guy anyway.

548
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But then I met the other two people during that week and by the end of the week.

549
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I decided I wanted to work with Seymour.

550
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So I had another appointment with him.

551
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And almost before I had a chance to say anything.

552
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He said, well, I've decided I'd like to have you come and join my lab.

553
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I said, well, that's funny. I decided I want to join your lab too.

554
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And then he insisted on driving me to Philadelphia.

555
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is an Atlantic city which is about 60 miles from Philadelphia.

556
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So I could see his lab and meet the other people, which I did.

557
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And that was very nice because then I knew them all by the time.

558
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I joined his group, six or eight months later.

559
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So from there, you were done to jail.

560
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
How did that find out?

561
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And what was it like?

562
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Think and bring exactly memory of your laboratory.

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Things were much different back then.

564
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I used to get unsolicited offers of assistant professors.

565
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If they're not supposed to know offers, I'd get a letter in the mail from the department chairman that would say would

566
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
you like to apply for assistant professors in art department.

567
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And see what I'm calling would come into the lab and occasion with letters.

568
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You would like to, they want me to recommend someone for this place of that place.

569
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Would you like to apply?

570
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Most of the time I said, well, no.

571
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But Yale was interesting.

572
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
My father had worked at the Yale Medical School after the war back in that interval

573
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
between our lives in Washington and State.

574
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And I knew Yale was a pretty good place.

575
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And so I told Seymour, he could go ahead and put my name in.

576
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But I told him, I really hope to get back to the West Coast.

577
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And he said, well, fine, I'll write to a couple of places where you like me to write.

578
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I said, well, you see Davis has a new biochemistry department.

579
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You could write to that.

580
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And also the University of Oregon has this new Institute of Molecular Biology.

581
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They have some terrific people there.

582
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So he wrote to both places.

583
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And they both wrote back and said, they had positions.

584
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And they were interested in, I should send my CV and so forth.

585
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Which I did.

586
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And the meantime, then I was invited up to Yale to be interviewed.

587
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And it was an interesting day.

588
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I gave the seminar at noon.

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And then I met immediately after the seminar with the search committee.

590
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And they gave me a lunch date, which I was trying to eat at the same time.

591
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I was trying to answer a question.

592
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So it was pretty stressful.

593
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And one of the search committee members took me to the train at the end of the day.

594
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And I went back to Philadelphia.

595
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And he said, well, we have to go through a series of steps before we can make a decision.

596
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And anything, but so maybe a while before you hear from us again.

597
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And I thought, well, that's fine.

598
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm not to hurry anyway, because I want to see what develops at Davis and Eugene.

599
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But within a week, I had a letter from them saying that the search committee had met.

600
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And they decided that they were going to recommend that I get the appointment.

601
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And it's over.

602
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And eventually, I did get a formal offer of a letter.

603
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And I sort of stole them as long as I could.

604
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And finally, it was a good offer.

605
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The salary was pretty poor.

606
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And by comparison with what my co-ord was getting at other places.

607
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But it was the biology department.

608
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I didn't consider myself so much in biologists.

609
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But they were trying to build up biochemistry and molecular biology within the department.

610
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
They wanted me to set up a lab class in biochemical research techniques that their graduate students could take.

611
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That was a little bit of a challenge.

612
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Anyway, I accepted the job on Monday.

613
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And then I wrote to the department chairs at Eugene and Davis.

614
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And then on Thursday, the phone rang in the lab.

615
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I took the call.

616
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It was the department chair at the U of O.

617
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And I said, oh, Dr. Matthews, we just got your letter.

618
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And we're terribly disappointed.

619
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We got your last recommendation in.

620
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The faculty had a meeting.

621
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
We decided you'd be ideal for the job.

622
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
We were about to invite you to come out and give a seminar.

623
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Can we get you to change your mind?

624
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And I said, I'm sorry.

625
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I didn't pay to commit that.

626
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That was that.

627
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then I went home thinking, I guess I'd give it up my last chance to go to a good university in the Pacific Northwest.

628
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And who would have known what happened years later.

629
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So I went to Yale in starting in January, 1964.

630
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And today's assistant professors, of course, got almost the first year without significant teaching responsibilities.

631
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
To set up their lab.

632
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And the very first thing I had to start setting up to teach this lab class,

633
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that was beginning the end of the, well, the beginning of the spring semester, which is the end of January,

634
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
that really February.

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And I had ordered almost everything I needed.

636
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But a teaching assistant, and I had to set up the lab.

637
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I had to write the protocols for all the labs that the students would do.

638
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And I had a class of 15 students.

639
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So I was very busy with teaching.

640
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
On the other hand, I also had my NIH research grant that started on January 1st.

641
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Grants were incredibly easy to get back then.

642
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And so I was buying equipment and hiring a technician and getting my research labs set up at the same time.

643
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It was sort of a continuation of what I'd done as a postdoc.

644
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
One of the things, this is actually kind of an amusing story, too.

645
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The thesis of my PhD thesis had been on the enzyme,

646
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm done hydrofolate reductase, which I told you was the target enzyme for the method structure.

647
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And there was another lab that had shown the enzyme that makes the methyl group of thymine,

648
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
reduces the methylene group to the methyl level.

649
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That requires two electrons.

650
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And the rate of DNA synthesis after T4 phase infection goes up by about tenfold,

651
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
which means there's a tremendous demand for DNA precursors, including thymine nucleotides.

652
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And so since there's a two electron reduction, it turns out that the tetrahedrofolate is oxidized, the dihydrofolate.

653
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And so when I became aware of all this, and I was talking to Seymar Cohen one day on the lab,

654
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and I said, you know, this big increase in demand for thymine nucleotides,

655
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
they're all these virus induced enzymes that you and the other labs have been discovering.

656
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We should be looking for dihydrofolate reductase.

657
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
There should be a virus specific form of dihydrofolate reductase as well.

658
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I know how to assay the enzyme. I worked on it for my PhD.

659
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So as I go ahead and do that.

660
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And he said, why did you focus on the problem that we agreed that you would work on

661
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
when you came to the lab and I said, okay.

662
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And then Seymar was out of town for three days or so.

663
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I did the experiment.

664
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And there was a 24th increase in the specific activity of dihydrofolate reductase.

665
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And in T-fage infected cells is compared to on infected cells.

666
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And it turned out to be really easy to show that it was a different enzyme from the,

667
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
of course, wanting enzyme that existed in the on infected bacteria.

668
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So one of the things I did, we got a short paper out of it.

669
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But one of the things that I did when I went to Yale was just a,

670
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it was a golden opportunity to get a free paper.

671
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We just to purify the enzyme and characterize it.

672
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Make mutants that were deficient in the production of the enzyme to see what their phenotype was and so far.

673
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So there were a number of problems related to DNA precursor metabolism,

674
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
particularly in infection by T even.

675
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The fact you were very just that got me off to a pretty decent start.

676
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And I published the six or eight papers in the first couple of years.

677
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I was at the Yale, even though I had a pretty heavy teaching load.

678
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So you were a Yale for four years, definitely.

679
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Roughly, actually three and a half by the calendar.

680
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But they started my appointment as assistant professor in July of 1963.

681
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I was in a sense for the first half year.

682
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And then I taught that lab class.

683
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And then in the fall, they had me set up a lab for the,

684
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
what was an undergraduate cell biology course,

685
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
which was basically biochemistry in the fall semester and cell biology and the spring semester.

686
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So a colleague and I shared the fall course where he did most of the lecturing.

687
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I taught the lab.

688
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And then in the year, research is in the change.

689
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And of course, you had kind of yellow.

690
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Were you sitting with that same faculty?

691
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, about research?

692
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yeah.

693
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, I stayed pretty much with that.

694
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I was branching out a little bit more biologically.

695
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And looking at questions such as the regulation,

696
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
the time-specific regulation, gene expression,

697
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
virus infection involves a very well-scheduled program of events

698
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and gene activation and deactivation.

699
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And so I was interested in what turns off the biosynthesis.

700
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
These are really enzymes that are involved in DNA metabolism.

701
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And then the activation of the late proteins,

702
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
which are mostly structural proteins of the virus,

703
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and proteins that help the virus assemble.

704
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So I was pretty much sticking with what I knew,

705
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
but branching out in slightly different directions.

706
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
What was your sense of the culture, Yale?

707
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah, that's an interesting question too.

708
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It was all male, of course, as far as the undergraduate or student body was concerned.

709
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
There was a fair amount of self-satisfaction.

710
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The undergraduate or students who were really bright,

711
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
at least enough of them were really bright to make it worth the effort to teach them.

712
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The graduate students seemed like kind of a mixed lot to me.

713
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I wasn't hugely impressed with them at the time,

714
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
except for some of the very good ones.

715
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And what's turned out in retrospect is that I maybe was a little bit too hard of them,

716
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
because a number of the graduate students that I thought were okay,

717
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
have turned out to have very successful careers.

718
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I see their names and all the time.

719
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So I guess the students were, they were as good as they thought they were.

720
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But in terms of the culture,

721
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
by decision to leave Yale after a fairly short period there,

722
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
it was hasten.

723
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I knew what I went there, I wouldn't have my whole career there.

724
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I didn't really want to live in the East Coast.

725
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I knew that most people would take non-tender jobs

726
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in the Ivy League, move somewhere else.

727
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And I thought it was a great place to start from.

728
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I might not have left so early, but we had a new department here

729
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
who came from Johns Hopkins.

730
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And he was a fairly argumentative sort.

731
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
He was someone who always wanted to put himself on the,

732
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
he wanted to polarize discussions.

733
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And so in my last year at Yale,

734
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
the other biochemist in the department had gone on sabbatical

735
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and no arrangements that had been made to take his place.

736
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So I was giving all of his lectures and the cell biology course

737
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that I was teaching the lab in the fall

738
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and then teaching the graduate lab in the spring.

739
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And in addition, I'd become a premedical advisor.

740
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So I had several dozen advisees that I had to meet with

741
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
and write letters of recommendation for.

742
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And I was being run ragged and trying to keep my research going as well.

743
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So there was a social function.

744
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And I went up to the departments here.

745
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
There was a large department there about 45 people in the department.

746
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So he barely knew me.

747
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And I engaged in a conversation.

748
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I asked him, what are your thoughts about teaching

749
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
versus research and an academic environment?

750
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And he said, well, of course you had to do a good teacher

751
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
if you want to succeed at Yale, but the main objective was

752
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
to make sure she said if you want to say a Yale,

753
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you research must settle it.

754
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It must absolutely settle it.

755
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And if you ever want to be a full professor of Yale in this department,

756
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
you have to be someone that we can confidently number

757
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
among the top 50 biologists in the country.

758
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So I went home and I figured with the amount of teaching

759
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and committee work I was doing, there wasn't any chance

760
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
of my rising to the top 50.

761
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And then I also looked around the department.

762
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And I didn't see very many full professors that I would rank

763
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
in the top 50 myself, there were one or two.

764
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So that has something to do with the culture, I guess.

765
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So you mentioned the 1967 movement Arizona?

766
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Right, that came about because the department

767
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
here at Arizona had been one of my professors at the

768
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
University of Washington.

769
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
He was on my committee.

770
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He was someone I liked a lot.

771
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And he called me up one day and told me

772
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
that the University of Arizona had a new medical school

773
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
starting and that he just agreed to be chairman

774
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
of the biochemistry department and what I liked

775
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and joined him.

776
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And I knew nothing about Arizona at the time.

777
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But I liked his name with Tom Hanahan,

778
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and he was in an area of biochemistry that's quite different

779
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
from mine.

780
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
He was an expert on biochemistry, fats and lipids.

781
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And the idea of starting something new.

782
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And there wasn't a matter of being interviewed

783
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
of search committees that are now a guy

784
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
that had basically just offered me a job over the phone.

785
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then I arranged to go out and visit.

786
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This was in January, 1967.

787
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And Kate went with me and we had to pay her expenses.

788
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And it was just a wonderful time.

789
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They put us up in a nice place.

790
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And we got up in the morning and stepped out the front door.

791
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I picked a great fruit for our breakfast off.

792
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
The tree that was going right next to our front door.

793
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And the dean and his wife took us out the dinner one night.

794
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And in my years at Yale, I never met my dean.

795
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The dean of the faculty of arts and sciences.

796
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And here was the dean taking us out of the dinner

797
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
and telling me how much they hoped that I would decide

798
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
to go there.

799
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It was a promotion break to be an associate professor.

800
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Big increase in salary.

801
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And the opportunity to help shape something

802
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
because the medical school was brand new.

803
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Every one in Arizona was excited about the medical school

804
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that was starting.

805
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And it just seemed like the right thing to do.

806
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And did it about the education?

807
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yes.

808
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I really enjoyed the time that we spent there.

809
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We were there for ten and a half years.

810
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And there was a lot of excitement in the first few years

811
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
having the feeling that we were helping to build the place up.

812
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
The medical school there was maybe half a mile from the main campus.

813
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Maybe a quarter mile.

814
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It was a five-minute bike ride or a ten-minute walk.

815
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And there was a little biochemistry group in the chemistry department.

816
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
There was pretty good.

817
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And a daughter part of the medical school was small.

818
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We had, I think, five or six faculty at the whole time.

819
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I was there.

820
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And so we merged and formed a joint graduate committee

821
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and biochemistry.

822
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So that was one of the things that I felt was a contribution

823
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
on my part in the part of Don Hannahand.

824
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That we wanted to build bridges to the main campus

825
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
or as in other fields like microbiology.

826
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They were barriers that were built up.

827
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And the bridges, I think, really were beneficial to the university.

828
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And now they have a combined university-wide department that serves

829
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the main campus people and the medical school people.

830
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And mostly located on the main campus.

831
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I think there are a couple of people left in the medical school building

832
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
that focused on medical education.

833
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So you were obligation-stained with friends on the old areas on that?

834
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yes, they did.

835
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Of course teaching medical students was quite a different experience.

836
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But I did also teach courses on the main campus

837
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and mostly the advanced undergraduate graduate level course

838
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
and some colleagues and I originated some graduate level courses.

839
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I don't think I did any graduate teaching

840
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
or Yale except for the graduate lab class.

841
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So I taught courses in biological regulatory mechanisms

842
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and nucleic acids and so forth as well as teaching

843
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
undergraduates and medical students.

844
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But overall, I think the teaching load was a little bit,

845
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I hate that term, teaching load of the teaching obligation.

846
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Teaching opportunity was a little bit lighter

847
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
than what it was ideal.

848
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And so there was a little bit more time to get involved in research.

849
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And again, there was building the department,

850
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
recruiting other faculty members, beginning to include graduate students

851
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and getting funding for graduate students' support

852
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and so forth.

853
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah, it was a different experience.

854
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So what kind of, what was your line of research

855
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
for students in the graduate lab class?

856
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Well, I continued with some of the projects

857
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
that were underway when I left Yale

858
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and picked up some new ones.

859
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But for the most part, they had to do with

860
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the end zymology and regulation of DNA precursors.

861
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
One thing that happened was that

862
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
people involved in T4 by Terry Fage genetics

863
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
had generated a large number of mutants

864
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
that were available.

865
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And there were mutants in maybe 15 genes

866
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that were involved in DNA synthesis.

867
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And it wasn't clear what the biochemical functions

868
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
all these genes coded for.

869
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And so I got involved in that a little bit

870
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
to what extent do we run?

871
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Might some of the genes have to do with DNA precursors

872
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and metabolism and to what extent might they have to do

873
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
with DNA replication itself.

874
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And so at some stage, I became interested

875
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
in the relationship between the synthesis of the

876
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
four DNA precursors, AGC and T,

877
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
to make it simplest.

878
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And the replication apparatus,

879
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
because DNA replication is a very rapid process.

880
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's in bacteria or in phase attack

881
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
of bacteria.

882
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The DNA chain will grow at something like

883
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
seven or eight hundred duplicatized per second.

884
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So I started thinking, how can the enzymes

885
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that are making the precursors throughout the cell?

886
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
How can they channel precursors to DNA polymerase

887
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
that replication apparatus fast enough

888
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
to sustain this rate?

889
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So I started working on the premise

890
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
that there was a super molecular

891
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
organization within the infected cell

892
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
with the precursor enzymes physically

893
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
located close to the replist on the machinery

894
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
that synthesized the DNA,

895
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
so that you could get channeling

896
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
of precursors to the DNA replication sites.

897
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And that was a pretty big part of my research.

898
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
For several of the years I was there,

899
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I was only going to try quite a bit of the time

900
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
that I was here.

901
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But we picked up some lines of research

902
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
on comparable questions

903
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and in mammalian cells,

904
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
which can ensure culture.

905
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I also had a couple of students

906
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
who worked on CCs quite independently

907
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
on things that were quite different

908
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
from anything that I did.

909
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
One of them was sure that aging

910
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
was a question of gene expression

911
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and that you should be able to learn something about

912
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
aging if you do something about the kinetics

913
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
of nucleic acid metabolism.

914
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And he did a thesis that was partly

915
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
computational, partly biochemical

916
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
on RNA metabolism that he published,

917
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
one paper he published independently

918
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and one paper he put my name on

919
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
as a courtesy gesture.

920
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And after I came here,

921
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
he joined my lab again.

922
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
He had a grant and he wanted to

923
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
he needed a site that he could work

924
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
or he could work fairly independently.

925
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I remember that I'd let him have his own head.

926
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So he was here for a couple of years.

927
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And then he got the idea of

928
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
adolescence as a potential drug

929
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
and founded a company called

930
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Antivirals and as a recreation room here in Corvals.

931
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And then that turned into ultimately

932
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
an avioid bio farmer,

933
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
which is about technology company in Corvals.

934
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And eventually he left them

935
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and formed another company,

936
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
gene tools,

937
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
which is in full almost,

938
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and it's hugely successful.

939
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So even though all I provided

940
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
was a supporting environment at Arizona,

941
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it's turned out having a very nice

942
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
spin-off here.

943
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
We're at about an hour.

944
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Are you going to know, okay?

945
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, fun.

946
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So this is your very brief experience

947
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
of the Southwest.

948
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And you mentioned the experiences

949
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that can be great for the Southwest.

950
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We really enjoyed living there.

951
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And both Kate and I are pretty enthusiastic

952
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
outdoors people.

953
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And we found out that there's a lot more

954
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
variety in Arizona than we ever

955
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
believed there was.

956
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Tucson is bring by four mountain ranges.

957
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We did a lot of backpacking there.

958
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And we went camping in Mexico.

959
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It turned out there were some very nice

960
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
beach areas on the Gulf of California

961
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
that we went camping at.

962
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And so we really did everything we could

963
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
to enjoy and profit from the Southwest.

964
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And we missed a lot of that.

965
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We missed being able to get into the outdoors

966
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
12 months of the year very easily.

967
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
But Tucson was growing with very little planning.

968
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And Tucson is one of the largest cities in the world

969
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that gets all of its water from underground.

970
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And when the chance came to come to come here.

971
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Of course, it was professionally a very nice opportunity.

972
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
We were helping Tucson.

973
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I wonder, do we really want to move?

974
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But one of the features was how much longer

975
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
is it going to make up water sustain the population?

976
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
How much longer are we going to have

977
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
these beautiful desert environments that

978
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
really state the developments are crowding onto?

979
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So that all convinced us that we really enjoyed

980
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the 10 years there.

981
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But maybe it was time to go.

982
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And every time we go back to Tucson,

983
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
we're horrified that the additional growth

984
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
that's occurred.

985
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You took this a battle over this.

986
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
UCSD in 1973.

987
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Right.

988
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Kate still criticizes me on occasion

989
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
for not having taken a European sabbatical end

990
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
because our children were something like 12 and 14

991
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
at the time.

992
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And they probably really would have profit

993
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
from a year in Europe.

994
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But I still had a fairly small research group

995
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and wanted to stay in reasonable close

996
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
touch with them.

997
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And of course UCSD was a growing

998
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
academic environment with some superb people.

999
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And we live near the B.

1000
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So it was a very nice living for the year.

1001
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I split the year between two different laboratories.

1002
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So I had two different kinds of experiences

1003
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and it was very nice.

1004
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It was a good sabbatical.

1005
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
What did you do there?

1006
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The false semester or the fall.

1007
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The first six months I worked with a guy named Gordon Sato,

1008
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
who was an expert on culturing cells

1009
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and maintaining their differentiated characteristics

1010
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
in culture.

1011
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And I wanted to learn tissue culture

1012
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
because I wanted to be able to branch out

1013
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
with our interest in the million systems.

1014
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So I could take what we were learning in microbial

1015
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
model systems and apply them to a million

1016
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
or maybe human systems.

1017
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So I wanted to learn tissue culture.

1018
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So I did a project I could have to do with

1019
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
with growth factors in cell culture.

1020
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And then in the second six months I went

1021
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
to the script's institutional biography

1022
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
while I had a very good friend who was an expert

1023
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
on the biochemistry of early events

1024
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
in fertilization using the sea urchin.

1025
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And so fertilization is a little comparable

1026
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
to the phagian effect of the metabolic change

1027
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that occurs as a huge turn on of DNA synthesis

1028
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and the cleavage cycle of the cell cleavage cycles

1029
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
are very fast.

1030
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So DNA genomes are reproduced

1031
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and of the order of half an hour.

1032
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And so the question in my mind was

1033
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
where do the precursors come from?

1034
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Are they stored or are they turned out of synthesis?

1035
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So that was what I worked on in Dave's lab

1036
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and it turned out that the sea urchin egg has

1037
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
huge supplies of the oxenucleusid triphosphates

1038
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and then backup pools of the monophosphates

1039
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and the triphosphates.

1040
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The egg is really geared to activate the DNA

1041
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
such as a very soon after fertilization.

1042
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And I thought about going back and working with that

1043
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
system a little bit of my own after I came here

1044
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
but never got around to it.

1045
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
There are plenty of other things to do.

1046
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
What's fantasy straight down there?

1047
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
No, I don't think so.

1048
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yeah, he was been at the sockets

1049
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
to not forgotten when he moved.

1050
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There I should know that because I reviewed

1051
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
the biography of France as quick as a few months ago

1052
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
for a journal in Dave's fascinating reading.

1053
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It was all this book.

1054
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
In my review, I wrote that this,

1055
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I've been asked to review quite a few scientific books over the years.

1056
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
This is the first one I actually read.

1057
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Word, cover, cover, cover.

1058
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
This readbook and all, but I'm pretty sure that was before

1059
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Kirk and move to saw it.

1060
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I was that right?

1061
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I was that right?

1062
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I was that right.

1063
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Because I knew the name already.

1064
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I knew he was a famous historian of science,

1065
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
the recent historian of science.

1066
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:35,000
See Mark Cohen was very interested in the really history of molecular biology.

1067
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
He was pretty unpopular with the crowd in that field

1068
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
because he was so aggressively pro biochemical

1069
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and didn't necessarily believe in genetics.

1070
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And see Mark Cohen was the first graduate

1071
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
that was student of Erwin Chargaff.

1072
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Chargaff who had promulgated the base to the composition

1073
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and regularities that helped Watson and Quick develop their model.

1074
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And Chargaff had been very bitter about being left out of credit

1075
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
for that.

1076
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And I think similar shared Chargaff's bitterness to some extent.

1077
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And so when the Nobel Prize was announced,

1078
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I was in Seymour's Laban.

1079
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
There's in 1962.

1080
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And it went to Watson and Quick and Maurice Wilkins.

1081
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And so Seymour came into the lab and said,

1082
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
well, if they were going to include Wilkins and the Nobel Prize,

1083
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
they should have included Chargaff because his contribution

1084
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
was just as substantial.

1085
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And I think you can make a pretty good case for that.

1086
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Of course, the Nobel Prize is limited to three awardees.

1087
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So I'm sure that didn't do very much for Erwin Chargaff's mood either.

1088
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But he was at the base for the candidate for the guy.

1089
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah, he was.

1090
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
In fact, Chargaff was the one who got me started thinking about Seymour Cohen

1091
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
because my second year in graduate school,

1092
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Chargaff came to Seattle and gave a series of lectures.

1093
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And during the lectures, he talked about virus induced enzyme.

1094
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
He talked about work by done by, quote,

1095
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
my student Seymour Cohen, unquote.

1096
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And so immediately went to the literature,

1097
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
started reading Seymour Cohen's papers.

1098
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I'd never heard of him before.

1099
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And that was what got me fired up.

1100
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And the fact that Seymour was,

1101
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Erwin Chargaff's student,

1102
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
but at some point, I met the guy that was the chairman of Biochemistry

1103
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,000
at Columbia when Chargaff had moved from Europe.

1104
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I think he was a refugee.

1105
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And Columbia took him in.

1106
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And so the chairman, whose name was Hans Clark,

1107
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
he was quite a distinguished Biochemistry.

1108
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
He told me what you're doing to our community.

1109
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And I said, well, I'm a post-doc in the University of Pennsylvania.

1110
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Oh, who are you working with?

1111
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm working with Seymour Cohen.

1112
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, yes, Seymour.

1113
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
He's one of my boys, you know.

1114
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
He was very paternal or paternalistic.

1115
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And so Seymour was, Erwin Chargaff's student.

1116
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But it turned out that when Seymour was working on his post-doc,

1117
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
or on his PhD,

1118
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
neither of them was working in a black ass at the time.

1119
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So Seymour has PhD thesis on long surfactant,

1120
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
which is a phospholipid.

1121
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And it wasn't until years later that both Chargaff and Cohen

1122
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
independently started working on the black ass at Biochemistry.

1123
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So there's something kind of fascinating about

1124
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
the personalities involved in the recent history of science.

1125
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Yeah.

1126
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah.

1127
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Cohen told me he was definitely in pretty big figure in the life.

1128
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
He was, you know, he taught the famous course in comparative biochemistry.

1129
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I don't remember who I never sat in on the course.

1130
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I should have.

1131
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But he was very broadly based.

1132
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
He was very rigorous in his thinking.

1133
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So I mean, he had a pretty prickly personality.

1134
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So so he was definitely a challenge to work for.

1135
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But he was so broad and he had so many ideas that I think

1136
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
influenced me to to read pretty widely in science.

1137
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And in trying to maintain it broad awareness.

1138
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
That's helping a lot in writing a textbook.

1139
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And also since I became a number of the editorial board of the Journal of Biological

1140
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Chemistry, I get sent papers to review that are way way outside of my area.

1141
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because editors know that I can sit down and read something.

1142
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I got a paper review a couple of years ago on the Biochemistry

1143
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Body Order, if you believe that.

1144
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Well, we refer to this a little bit.

1145
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
In 1970, we used OEC and it sounds like they made a pretty good opportunity.

1146
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And that's the primary reason.

1147
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Right.

1148
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
There was an interesting situation too.

1149
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I didn't have any real reasons to leave Arizona.

1150
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
As I said, you can always find things to feel uneasy about.

1151
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
But I felt pretty well, accepted on the campus.

1152
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:34,000
But I said, my family was all still in the Pacific Northwest.

1153
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And so I kept my eye out for opportunities.

1154
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And OEC advertised for a chair of the Department of Biochemistry

1155
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and Biophysics and Science.

1156
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
So I wrote sent by CV.

1157
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And eventually it was asked for my reference as always.

1158
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It sent the names of references.

1159
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And eventually it was asked to interview.

1160
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And I had enough information about the departments.

1161
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And I know that it was a pretty good department.

1162
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And they sent me the data on the research funding of the faculty.

1163
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And there were 14 faculty at the time.

1164
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And everyone except one had some kind of outside research funding.

1165
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Publication records looked pretty good.

1166
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So on the days when I was interviewed, it was a two-day or two-and-a-half-day process.

1167
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I had a series of half-hour talks with the faculty.

1168
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And each one, I would say, you know, you got a good department.

1169
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Why are you looking outside for your chair?

1170
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You could, you could fill the chairmanship inside.

1171
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And I got told pretty much the same thing by everyone.

1172
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And of course, when you get consistency, that's a pretty good sign.

1173
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And what they said was, this is our only chance to bring in a senior

1174
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
level faculty person who can bring out a funded research program

1175
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and give a jump start to our departments reputation.

1176
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Because if we appointed an inside person to chair them,

1177
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
we'd have to fill the vacancy assistant professor level.

1178
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So that made sense.

1179
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And they said that the department was in pretty good shape scientifically.

1180
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And personally everyone got along, which really seemed to be the case.

1181
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And so what they wanted was someone who was a pretty active scientist and teacher

1182
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
who was willing to do some administration and leadership.

1183
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And that was sort of how I saw myself.

1184
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I knew by that time I could probably handle the administrative details.

1185
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Being a department chair, but it wasn't the be all and end all of my existence.

1186
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And so it was a pretty good fit.

1187
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And then after a few weeks after the interview, the dean called up to the offer me the

1188
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
job, it was like 40th birthday.

1189
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And so it seemed like a, it seemed like an element of something.

1190
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And that was kind of amusing too, because I put in a call,

1191
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
oh, this happened later on.

1192
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So I got the offer.

1193
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And then Kate and I weren't invited back to visit again at this time.

1194
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It was a recruitment visit.

1195
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And it was very pleasant again.

1196
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And then went back home and after a while thought things over and decided I would accept the job.

1197
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So I put in a call to the dean and he was out of the office.

1198
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And he would call back.

1199
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And I sat there thinking I was about to make a decision that would affect the rest of my life.

1200
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And the phone rang, and I thought it was Dean Kraus calling me back.

1201
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
No, it was the guy from the Biochemistry Department of the University of California Davis.

1202
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Asking her if I'd like to be considered for the chairmanship of the department there.

1203
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And I said, you got a great department, but I think it's a little too late.

1204
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So what was the set of priority that you bought in the chairmanship?

1205
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
The main priority for me to keep my research program.

1206
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Visible on productive.

1207
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's quite a job to move research program.

1208
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I knew that the department would be in pretty good shape.

1209
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
There were a few things that needed to be done.

1210
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
You know, I knew I could handle whatever teaching I need to do here.

1211
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But not all the people that were working with me and Tucson chose to come.

1212
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So I had to punch more people.

1213
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And my major research grant had, I don't remember a year and a half or so to run.

1214
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And I just wanted to make sure that I got enough papers out during that time.

1215
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So I'd be competitive.

1216
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It was grants were already this now on the late 1970s.

1217
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
The grant situation was taken into tight notes.

1218
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So that was my first priority.

1219
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
You worked out pretty well.

1220
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Did administrative pressures change the design?

1221
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yes.

1222
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But actually getting back to priorities for just a minute.

1223
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
There were some things in the department early on that I felt should get taken care of.

1224
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
One was the fact that the graduate students.

1225
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
There was hardly any money in the department to support teaching assistants.

1226
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So there wasn't much state money that would support students who weren't committed to a lab.

1227
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So almost all of the students came on research assistants,

1228
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
which aren't they were committed to the lab whose research grant was paying their assistantship.

1229
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And I thought that a first year graduate with programs should have opportunity for students to come on committed.

1230
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I thought it was a great strength that students could come here and start right to work with a person that they wanted to work with,

1231
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,000
but that many students come without a specific set of interests.

1232
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And they should have an opportunity to go through rotation.

1233
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So pretty high priority for me early on was to get an NIH training grant that would provide funds for tuition and stipends for half of the students or so.

1234
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So that we could bring out a few and give them a year to look around and then go on to research assistantships.

1235
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And my first attempt was unsuccessful.

1236
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
That was kind of interesting too because we got kind of a mediocre score on the grant application.

1237
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I'm really kind of a naughty critique in which the whoever reviewed the grants said the training record of the faculty doesn't seem to be particularly strong.

1238
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Most of the graduates seem to have taken jobs in industry.

1239
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And I wrote to the NIH and I said, what is this?

1240
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It seems to me that Congress, which funds the NIH might have second thoughts about the training grant program in industrial positions, they're seeing the second rate.

1241
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So I'm going to revise the application and I'd like to have a site visit.

1242
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
So you can see what we have out here.

1243
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And so the second time we had a site visit and we got the grant and had it for two or three cycles.

1244
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
That was a third of an institutional priority for me.

1245
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And then in 1981.

1246
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So this was an opportunity to sort of dumped in my lap, but it was an institutional priority for me.

1247
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:33,000
The dean called me in and said that the MJ Murdoch charitable trust, you know about the Murdoch trust.

1248
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:41,000
This is a large foundation that was created from the estate of Jack Murdoch who was one of the founders of Tectronics.

1249
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Murdoch died prematurely in an airplane accident.

1250
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And he left most of the state entrusted as a foundation to support educational charitable and community organizations, that's certainly more or less.

1251
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And they used to give project grants to faculty here.

1252
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But apparently the trust had told the president, we've figured that they now wanted to focus their grants more on large multi-person projects that represented institutional priorities.

1253
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And so the dean and the president and others then decided that he was time to make a push in molecular biology.

1254
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So they called me and as the person to sort of the point person to write something up.

1255
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
And it was clear, that was right.

1256
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It was very much a time to make a push even though that doesn't pretty good people scattered around the university here in that area.

1257
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And it was clear to me that there's multi-departmental cooperation is very strong on this campus.

1258
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And so whatever we did should be in a multi-departmental, multi-disciplinary framework.

1259
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So I propose that the university creates something to be called a center-progene research.

1260
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And that the grant then fund three positions and pay their salaries and start-up costs for two years with the commitment by the university that their salaries would be continued at the end of that two years.

1261
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And that the search would be conducted in a multi-departmental framework.

1262
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
There was old money also for project grants for the faculty that was here.

1263
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And so then we, when the grant was funded, we had a multi-departmental search that bought three excellent people in.

1264
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
One who came to art department is now the chairman of art department, Gary Merrill.

1265
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
One who went to botany, Carol Ruin.

1266
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And one who went to microbiology and I've done this really is now the chief scientist offered officer at the Siege Pharmaceutical, so very good people.

1267
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:07,000
In the meantime, the people in the ag school wanted to form a biotechnology institute or biotechnology center.

1268
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And present, we figure told them that there wasn't a, that the campus wasn't big enough to have two competing centers and areas related to biotechnology.

1269
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And they'd better work with us.

1270
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So, so we made the center.

1271
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I mean, I had no idea it would grow to something that encompass the whole campus the way I did, but it turned out to be very successful.

1272
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And in the first several years, I think 1985, the center would call it on so well that the legislature appropriated a pretty fierce chunk of change as continuing a continuing budget for the, quite that time of the CGRB.

1273
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So, that was something else that worked out pretty well.

1274
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And then I served the director of the center for a year and a half or so after the first director of the web, the fairly abruptly.

1275
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But, well, it continued to get bigger and stronger and after, after I resigned as director because I couldn't handle.

1276
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Two administrator jobs and still keep a research lab going and keep my teaching going.

1277
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And so there was sort of an interim appointment made while there was an outside search and rust mines came from the University of Nebraska.

1278
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And he built it up a bit.

1279
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And then he retired and then it really big push came when Jim County was brought in.

1280
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And of course, he had a superb research program.

1281
01:20:48,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And so, I think his program attracted a lot of other people and departments all over the campus were beginning to use molecular biology techniques.

1282
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:14,000
So, the center and then Jim changed the focus of the center with a big emphasis on genomics and computational biology.

1283
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000
In fact, the name of the center was changed. I didn't realize this for a couple years. It's still the CGRB.

1284
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But now instead of being the center for gene research and biotechnology, it's the center for genome research and bio computing.

1285
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And so, five or six years ago, there was the University wide hiring initiative in genomics and bio computing.

1286
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And there was another moly departmental search that I think brought five faculty members.

1287
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And they're outstanding people. One of them is the Michael Freytale you came through the art department and his office is right next door to mine.

1288
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
And one is Todd Mochler and botanists and extremely well.

1289
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I think he left Carrington left this year to become president of director of the Danforth Foundation in St. Louis.

1290
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You know, I just learned it there too that Mochler went with him. But it really outstanding people came and that focused the center change.

1291
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And it's well rooted in the University of the Central Service Lab, which the center maintains.

1292
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It carries out multi-investigator procedures, nucleic acid sequencing and algal peptide synthesis that it's been doing for years.

1293
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:51,000
But it also has a very large computational and second generation DNA sequencing capability grafted on.

1294
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
So it's got bigger and stronger over the years.

1295
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So getting back to administrative responsibilities, how did they shift over the years?

1296
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:09,000
They shifted in that it got harder and harder to get money.

1297
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And there was a little bit more administration that had to get done.

1298
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So the first year or two I was here.

1299
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
One of my colleagues got money in one of his grants.

1300
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
$100,000 to buy an electron microscope. This is one of our department was doing water at Hall.

1301
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And he came to me and said, we need a broom to put the luck on microscope.

1302
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And I said, well, I guess we're going to have to see the deans. We don't see Dean Cross.

1303
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And it was maybe a 15-minute conversation.

1304
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And he found $50,000 to renovate some space on the first floor of the wonder.

1305
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And so we got the pretty substantial amount of money on the basis of a short one short conversation.

1306
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And getting money became harder and harder at one point.

1307
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So our department was always been very heavily involved with the Environmental Health Science Center.

1308
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:15,000
This is a center that's funded with a core grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

1309
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And it was originally headquartered basically in what used to be the Department of Agricultural Chemistry.

1310
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And that again, as a center that's become bigger and stronger over the years.

1311
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And at some point when the previous director retired, Dawn Reed, who was an art department, became the director of Civil War,

1312
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:43,000
headling involved with that center. And one of the hardest things for me in my last several years of being departments here

1313
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
was accumulating competitive start-up packages that's when we wanted to recruit a faculty member.

1314
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That's one thing to get a salary line.

1315
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But around the country, the amount of money you had to put together to attract someone.

1316
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
It's getting larger and larger because a new assistant professor couldn't count on getting his or her first grant.

1317
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Funded and needed some money from day one.

1318
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And I remember one of the people who came in as a vice president for research, which is one of the major sources that we would go to.

1319
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I think I've suppressed his name because I dislike him so much.

1320
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Somehow or another, he never caught on to the idea that the discretionary funds he had as a disposal.

1321
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
One of the highest priorities of him should be contributions toward set up on.

1322
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Then Dawn Reed was still the director of the, of the, the EHSC and I that, you know,

1323
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
talk to yourself, blew in the face before we got a token contribution from him.

1324
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And we were just really irritated.

1325
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And I remember another interesting episode we had with the Environmental Health Science Center.

1326
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
When Dawn Reed became director of the Center, this was in the early 1980s.

1327
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,000
He also was pretty expansionist. He wanted to build and solidify the EHSC.

1328
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And this is our pan theoretical, but in my opinion, one of the strengths of Oregon State, they said something about the interdepartmental cooperation.

1329
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
You have strong individual departments.

1330
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
But these, you have the centers that that span departmental boundaries.

1331
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
We have the CGRB.

1332
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
The EHSC, and of course, the line is calling and suit.

1333
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And I think all of these centers have done nothing but good things for the university by bringing in more research strength.

1334
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:51,000
The thing that Dawn Reed wanted to do was to use the funds he had in the center to establish two or three new

1335
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
faculty positions that would be partly funded by the EHSC and partly funded by university funds.

1336
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So one of the positions would be in the order department.

1337
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You wanted to get someone who was using cell culture to study basically areas related to environmental toxicology.

1338
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And the dean at the time said, well, our department was over staffed already that we had too many faculty positions for the number of credit hours that we taught.

1339
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You know, the kind of thinking that the administrators goes through.

1340
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And the first bolt on and I saw this is a great opportunity to strengthen the department.

1341
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Research was and bring in some more money to the department.

1342
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
And Dawn was pretty aggressive.

1343
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So he set up a.

1344
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So he set up a appointment and meeting with president and figure.

1345
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And six or eight of a sat around a table, including Dawn and myself.

1346
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And George Keller, who was the vice president for research in the time.

1347
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And Dean Suga Harrow, Dean of the College of Science and the president.

1348
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Maybe one or two others.

1349
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And Dean Suga Harrow went through his routine that the department was over staffed already.

1350
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And he couldn't justify putting even a part of his salary into our budget under the circumstances.

1351
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And then Dawn regave his pitch.

1352
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I don't think I said much about anything.

1353
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I was just there for support.

1354
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Dawn got all the negative brownie points from the dean.

1355
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And at the end of Dawn's talk.

1356
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Part of the figure said, let's sound like a pretty good proposal.

1357
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Let's go ahead with it.

1358
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And I thought the dean was going to cry.

1359
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And so at that from that point on Dawn reads name was poison in the college of science.

1360
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
But it worked out very well.

1361
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
He brought in David Barnes.

1362
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
There's no longer here but that position was established.

1363
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And we got a research facility that's helped the whole campus community.

1364
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And then he brought in Dale Mosbau.

1365
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And what kind of was Adam Kim?

1366
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That Mosbau had a superb research program until he died very young in 2004.

1367
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:19,000
But the idea that you could use center funds to strengthen research programs within departments.

1368
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And the strength and enter departmental cooperation has been a keynote for the CGRB, the EHSC, and the Linus Pauling Institute.

1369
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:37,000
In fact, the early history of the Linus Pauling Institute is pretty interesting too.

1370
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Dawn Reed was acting director of the Institute while we had a search for director.

1371
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And I was chair of the search committee that brought bolts right here.

1372
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And that worked out extremely successfully.

1373
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Balls that's so good in the people he brought in are just outstanding.

1374
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But I think the only time I ever had a one-and-one conversation with President Richard was shortly,

1375
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
while this was all underway.

1376
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I think I don't remember whether Balls ride or ride yet are still having research.

1377
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
But, of course, it was concerned all over the campus about LPI.

1378
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
How would drain research resources away from the administration?

1379
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And of course, the Linus Pauling Institute in California was pretty mixed with scientific equality.

1380
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And that was a bit of a concern.

1381
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
But John Bern really pushed the whole thing.

1382
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It was his legacy to the university.

1383
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And we were, and so, Richard and I were walking together from some function.

1384
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And it was just the two of us.

1385
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And he said, what do you think about this move of the Linus Pauling Institute?

1386
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Anyway, he was pretty negative about the whole thing.

1387
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And I said, it doesn't make any difference.

1388
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
What you were, I think about it.

1389
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
It's happening anyway.

1390
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And at the time, I think I was one of the cautious ones about it too.

1391
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
But I'd become nothing but a supporter.

1392
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Because we were so fortunate in getting balls to come here as our first choice.

1393
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I thought the recruitment would be very difficult because the LPI occupied space that our department

1394
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
had occupied before we moved to the Agamilite Science.

1395
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And it was pretty, it was, the space was pretty trashed.

1396
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But, but both saw that it could work.

1397
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
They did a little bit of renovation.

1398
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And of course, they said that a new building would be something that would be fairly high on the prior scale.

1399
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It took a long time, but it worked.

1400
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So you asked about the administrative load.

1401
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
The other thing that happened in those last several years was the planning of the Agamilite Science

1402
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
that took a lot of time.

1403
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And then in the initial planning, I became aware that there were documents in the university

1404
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:23,000
that had five levels of space assignment depending on what kind of department or college you were in.

1405
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And of course, agriculture and forestry were on the highest level of number square feet per FTE of lab space, square feet per FTE for office space.

1406
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And science was a level below Ag.

1407
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And so we started having our first planning meetings.

1408
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And it was mostly Ag people, of course, because it was the Ag and life sciences.

1409
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And we were biochemistry by physics was put into the department sort of accidentally.

1410
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And the way I understood it was the administration was having trouble assembling funding for the building.

1411
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And it's all seriously, but the way I heard it was the George Keller said,

1412
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
well, we don't have enough pizzazz in the building.

1413
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
We have a range of science. We have ag administration.

1414
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
We have horticulture that all, personally, justifiable.

1415
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
But we need to put some of our environmental science.

1416
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
We need to put some of our biotechnology in there.

1417
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
And apparently, Dean Horne was at the planning meeting and he said, well, you know, biochemistry in bio physics.

1418
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
He's heavily involved in both of the biotechnology and environmental health science.

1419
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
So we were moved in very quickly.

1420
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But then it turned out that they wanted to assign us space on the science level of science.

1421
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And I figured if we're moving to the new building, we need to have the same kind of space allocation

1422
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
that the other governments in the building had.

1423
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Is it about that time about that time of friend of mine who was chairman of the search committee

1424
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
for Dean of science at Penn State invited me to come to look at the job.

1425
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And after I looked at it, I didn't want the job, but it was clear that they wanted me.

1426
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So I went to talk to Graham Spanner, of course, who would come here from Penn State.

1427
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And now as back there is one of the most successful university presidents in the country.

1428
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And Graham was very excited to hear that they wanted me to go to Penn State.

1429
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
He didn't talk to me at all about what can we do to keep you.

1430
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
He wanted to know a lot about what was happening at Penn State and so forth.

1431
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
But he did eventually, you know, what would it take to keep you?

1432
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And I had two things in mind that would benefit the department.

1433
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And one of them was space allocation and building.

1434
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
They said they're basically trying to talk and sound on space.

1435
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,000
We have adequate space and one of your space is kind of second-rate quality was.

1436
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
But if we're going to be asked to help plant a new building and move into space,

1437
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
we need to.

1438
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:21,000
We need to be assured that if we don't have to accept any less square footers, what we have now.

1439
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
So he put that on a ladder that helped me a lot.

1440
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
He's going to have to be the planning process.

1441
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
But that took a lot of time too.

1442
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Were there any major shifts in your research in the years?

1443
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Yes, not major.

1444
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I've always been involved in nucleotide.

1445
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
The oxygen nucleotide and DNA precursor in zymology.

1446
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But I can tell you, yeah, the answer is yes, I'll get to that in a minute.

1447
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:59,000
But I'll tell you another story about the new building that you might want to entertain.

1448
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
This has to do with the administrative load.

1449
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And you have to watch these guys all the time.

1450
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Actually, two stories.

1451
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
One time we were meeting and the administration building.

1452
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And we were being told that there wasn't enough money to build a building with size.

1453
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
That was being discussed in the beginning.

1454
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
And we were going all around the table.

1455
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
What can we do about this cutback?

1456
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And that cutback.

1457
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
And it was getting pretty late in the country.

1458
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And the evening, you know, six o'clock, six or three or so.

1459
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
And at the guy named Ed Coat was the vice president for the administration of the time.

1460
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And he was kind of a laughing sock in the faculty.

1461
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And he was getting more and more in a patient.

1462
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
He basically said finally, hey, it's getting late here.

1463
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Let's just lock off a floor and we can leave.

1464
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So that's solidified our view.

1465
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But I quote, and somehow it ended up that the building was built.

1466
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I think the university got a bargain.

1467
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
It's a very good building.

1468
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
You know, it's done with the fund available.

1469
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:11,000
But at one point, the architect told me that we've built a prototype laboratory.

1470
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So you and your colleagues can go over look at it.

1471
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Look at the cabinet.

1472
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Look at the shell.

1473
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Look at the bench top.

1474
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Look at the utility.

1475
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You can see what it looked like.

1476
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I said where it's in Moreland Hall.

1477
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
There's a member of the psychology faculty.

1478
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Bill Smotherman, who does physiological work.

1479
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And he needed an upgrade to his lab.

1480
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
So we've built that as a prototype lab.

1481
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And you can go and see what it looks like.

1482
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And so we went over and it did a nice lab.

1483
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And so we could see what kind of countertops they're going to have.

1484
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And then it occurred to me to ask someone, hey, where the money come from to do this.

1485
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It turns out that Bill Smotherman had been offered a job in another institution.

1486
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And he needed in order to stay.

1487
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
One of the things that he needed was an upgrade to the labs.

1488
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
So we went to his dean, the dean went to the then provost.

1489
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
And somehow things are coming about.

1490
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So the money was siphoned out of our building project.

1491
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
To build this guy's lab.

1492
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And so we raised hell about it.

1493
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And so they had to find the money from somewhere else and put it back in the building project.

1494
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
So you had to be on your toes all the time about these guys.

1495
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
So getting back to research.

1496
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I had a graduate student in the early.

1497
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Who finished in about 1982.

1498
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Who did his thesis on.

1499
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
On the DNA precursor, she supplied for the mitochondrial.

1500
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
A genome.

1501
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'd seen a paper in the literature that suggested that.

1502
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
The mitochondrial genome is fed by.

1503
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
A distinct precursor pool that might be generated within the mitochondria.

1504
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And so.

1505
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Rick Bestwick did a thesis on the series of experiments.

1506
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And indicated yes indeed that the pools were physically.

1507
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And distinct and regulatory sense as well.

1508
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And then that sort of sat there until late 1990s.

1509
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And another grader of student joined our group.

1510
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
She was a song.

1511
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Chinese student.

1512
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Who wanted to follow up on that.

1513
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
He was a.

1514
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
He had a medical degree from China.

1515
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And a number of diseases had been described that have.

1516
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
That have a genetic.

1517
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Effects within the mitochondria.

1518
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And some of them are mutations within the mitochondrial genome.

1519
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Some of them are mutations in the nuclear.

1520
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Genome that encode proteins that are transported into mitochondria.

1521
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And function there.

1522
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
And so that's some very interesting.

1523
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
The disease.

1524
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And of course now there's also the.

1525
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
The.

1526
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The idea that.

1527
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Immulation of mutations in the mitochondrial.

1528
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Genome is partly responsible for cancer and aging.

1529
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And since we knew that.

1530
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Aspects of DNA precursor metabolism.

1531
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Our mutagenic determinants.

1532
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
That is metabolic.

1533
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Dearranged one.

1534
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But if you will.

1535
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Of a deoxinucytoid metabolism.

1536
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Can effect.

1537
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The mutation rate.

1538
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
We wanted to learn more about the.

1539
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
The mitochondrial pools of DNA precursor.

1540
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
She's where they came from.

1541
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
How they were regulated.

1542
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
And how.

1543
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
This might affect mutation rate.

1544
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
It turns out the.

1545
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's great for the mitochondrial genomes.

1546
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Much higher than it is for the nuclear genome.

1547
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And why should this be.

1548
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So she way did his thesis on this.

1549
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And he was one of my last.

1550
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Gradual students to finish.

1551
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
But by the time he started publishing papers.

1552
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Mesthesis.

1553
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
We began to get some notice for this.

1554
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So.

1555
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I got funding.

1556
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Actually after I retired.

1557
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And it was hoping I'd be able to keep.

1558
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Research funding going.

1559
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Because this was turning out to be a pretty productive one of research.

1560
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So.

1561
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
So.

1562
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So that.

1563
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
In fact, that has been.

1564
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
The total of our research since about.

1565
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
2003.

1566
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And.

1567
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And.

1568
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Had.

1569
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Pretty decent funding for that.

1570
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I'm during that time.

1571
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
The three.

1572
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Gradual students that I had.

1573
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
At the time.

1574
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I retired in 2002.

1575
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
They took.

1576
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Two and three four years to finish.

1577
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And they were done.

1578
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
But after that.

1579
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I kept my lab going with a technician and a postdoc.

1580
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And one or two undergrad was supposed to time.

1581
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Now I decided to.

1582
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
So what my funding expire and what there's a new faculty number and our department is going to take over our lab.

1583
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So my last.

1584
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Grand expires.

1585
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And the year.

1586
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
But for the last year.

1587
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Last year.

1588
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
It's.

1589
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's taking the.

1590
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Knowledge in the background.

1591
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I have.

1592
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:14,000
The stage.

1593
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
If the major tech snow.

1594
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I don't think no kids must go in notch.

1595
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But they got away.

1596
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And the gesehen devastating.

1597
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
The most popular thing in the city is in this city.

1598
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I found this in the outside.

1599
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:39,000
And we have two sort of dance level undergraduate, of course,

1600
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
this BB-451, which most students say is a two-quarter sequence,

1601
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
and then BB-494-901 and 492.

1602
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And these can both be taken as an undergraduate graduate.

1603
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And these two books came out.

1604
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And one of them we assigned is a 450-course,

1605
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
and one we adopted for the 494, and they're both terrible.

1606
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
At some point in the spring,

1607
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I was eating my lunch in my office,

1608
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
and a publisher's representative came in,

1609
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
and I sort of set my sandwich aside.

1610
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And so I told them how disappointed we were with all the textbooks

1611
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
that were on the market.

1612
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And he said, well, you know, you know,

1613
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
so much about what's wrong with all these books.

1614
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You ought to be writing your own book.

1615
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
And I said, are you crazy?

1616
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I don't have the time or the expertise to write a whole book.

1617
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I said, well, get a co-author.

1618
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Well, I was about to go on sabbatical leave

1619
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
to Sweden, and I thought, well, you know,

1620
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
maybe I could write in the evening working a lot during the day.

1621
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So it's not a completely crazy idea.

1622
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And I was talking to my colleague, Bob Becker, about this.

1623
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
And he said, well, why don't you talk to Ken Van Holt?

1624
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
He's talked about writing textbooks from time to time.

1625
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And Ken and I had taught graduate,

1626
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
but of course, it's together.

1627
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I knew he was extremely articulate and brilliant scientists.

1628
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And he had a good sense of humor.

1629
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And also was much more of a physical biochemist than I am.

1630
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
His PhD is actually a physical chemistry.

1631
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
So I went and talked to Ken and he said, well,

1632
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I have to be crazy to even think about something like this.

1633
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
But yes, I am interested.

1634
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
So we went down and visited the publisher and talked to our editor.

1635
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And she said that each of us should write a sample chapter.

1636
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And we should write a chapter outline.

1637
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And a prospectus sample chapter.

1638
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And she bought each of us a compact computer.

1639
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
This is just before a Macintosh came out.

1640
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
But there were slightly portable computers.

1641
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
So I took one with me to Stockholm.

1642
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And by the way, it's not like that.

1643
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
It's not like that.

1644
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
It's slightly portable computer.

1645
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
So I took one with me to Stockholm.

1646
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And by the time I had finished writing my sample chapter,

1647
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I thought this is more work on what I let myself in for.

1648
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
But we sent the material in in December, Diane called up.

1649
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
She said the reviewers all liked what we've written.

1650
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And they thought we ought to go ahead.

1651
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
So they wanted scientists to contract.

1652
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So I thought, oh, God, what do I do now?

1653
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And he said, oh, yeah, I said, I think it's terrific.

1654
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Let's go.

1655
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
So there was no alternative.

1656
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And we went ahead with it.

1657
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And many times during the writing process,

1658
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I thought I was crazy to get involved in this.

1659
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
If I could quit, I would.

1660
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But in retrospect, I'm glad that we stuck with it.

1661
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And it took a long time because it was 1984 that they first started talking to us about the book.

1662
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
It was early 85 when we signed the contract.

1663
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And then I had a lot of things that got me behind schedule when I came back from a sabbatical.

1664
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And we didn't really plunge into work on any kind of schedule basis to a spring or so of 1986.

1665
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But we had the first draft done.

1666
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Maybe in spring of 88.

1667
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
No, I must have been.

1668
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I don't remember the dates now.

1669
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Because it took a year or so to produce the book after the after the chapter drafts were done.

1670
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,000
So the whole thing was about a almost a five year process.

1671
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And the subsequent additions were much easier.

1672
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It was a difficult process.

1673
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
There's that was the point of view of the two authors.

1674
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
It was going to be writing something.

1675
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Actually, that was the easiest part.

1676
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Ken and I split up responsibility for chapters very easily.

1677
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
We agreed to read each other chapters.

1678
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I did most of the metabolism.

1679
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
He did most of the structural biochemistry.

1680
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And we sort of split the molecular biology to genetic biochemistry.

1681
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,000
And the editors were very concerned about burzing our pros styles.

1682
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I think we did pretty well.

1683
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Although now that I'm writing some for our fourth edition, which he's not involved in,

1684
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I'm writing some rewriting some chapters he wrote.

1685
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:23,000
And I'm seeing some differences between his writing style and mine.

1686
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But the difficulty we had in the first edition was simply spirited arguments with our editors.

1687
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
They kept the pretty heavy hand on us.

1688
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And we disagreed with it pretty frequently.

1689
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
But they ended up being pretty good friends.

1690
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And we had a different editorial team, each of the editions.

1691
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
But that was where the energy came out.

1692
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But Ken and I had nothing but good relations.

1693
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,000
The one thing he was all disappointing was that he spent almost half the year at his summer home.

1694
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
He would hold that he established when he was at the University of Illinois before he came here.

1695
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And that's true.

1696
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
So it wasn't always a matter of just walking down the hall if I wanted to talk to him.

1697
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
But he worked out pretty well.

1698
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
It did pretty well.

1699
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I can't tell you how much percentage of the market had captured.

1700
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
But the publisher very pleased.

1701
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,000
He in terms of the royalties we were very pleased.

1702
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And I've been told by quite a few people.

1703
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I mean, this is not something I should be talking about.

1704
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
But I've been told that that is the most clearly written book on the market.

1705
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And I know it had brought us a lot of attention.

1706
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I know when I was in Svadical even Sweden.

1707
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I got a call one day.

1708
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
And from someone at the University of Lipsaw, they wanted me to come and meet with a group of

1709
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:01,000
their biochemistry teachers to tell them my thoughts about teaching biochemistry.

1710
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I gave a talk in South Africa a few years ago.

1711
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And their biochemistry meeting and the students were coming up and wanting to be photographing

1712
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
because they'd used our book.

1713
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
So a lot of things happened that were very gratifying and ego.

1714
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So from that standpoint, I guess our book was received well enough.

1715
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It was worth the effort and worth the effort after the project.

1716
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I thought it was dead after the third edition was done.

1717
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
That it was worth picking up for the fourth edition.

1718
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:39,000
As you look back on your career, what are some of the things you've posted?

1719
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I guess the first thing is the fact that I trained 35 PhD students.

1720
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And most of them have done very well on their careers.

1721
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
And it's like being a parent.

1722
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
And most of them have stayed in enough contact.

1723
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I have the feeling that I made a difference in their lives.

1724
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Another thing that I've been satisfied with is maintaining a balance of teaching and research through all the positions I've had.

1725
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Because I always enjoyed teaching.

1726
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I'm pretty enthusiastic about the field.

1727
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I like to know what's going on in the field.

1728
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I like to explain to others whether it's in writing or speaking.

1729
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And I like to set an example for colleagues who might be focused only on their research.

1730
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:47,000
That you can be a successful research scientist and still maintain personal communication with students,

1731
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
with colleagues, with people and other departments on the campus.

1732
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
That science can be a social activity.

1733
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:05,000
So I would say the breadth of interest and association that has something else I take satisfaction in.

1734
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And being able to save funded for years and a very difficult, increasingly difficult environment.

1735
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And the book.

1736
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I mean, that's a pretty big part of my life.

1737
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
A pretty big strain in our family situation for a long time.

1738
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But now Kate is just supportive about the whole thing as I am.

1739
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
She likes it when I come home and tell her stories about experience that we had.

1740
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
So it's been a big plus also.

1741
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Is there anything that we missed that we missed on?

1742
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Well, yeah, I guess there's always been the thought about what, again, parallel.

1743
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Whereas parallel universes.

1744
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
What if I go on into medicine?

1745
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And that's hit at several times when I was in college trying to decide which way to go.

1746
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Of course my father was a doctor.

1747
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I thought the world of them.

1748
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And I talked in a kid and maybe we could go out of practice together.

1749
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
And that could have been fun.

1750
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
But dad was very good about not putting pressure on.

1751
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
He said it was my decision whether to go on the science or medicine.

1752
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And the U.S. about the red college culture earlier.

1753
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And premeds were sort of frowned on as being grade lovers.

1754
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Even though we gave grades, but the students weren't told what the grades were.

1755
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
And the idea was to make you less grade causes.

1756
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But the premeds were a little more narrow on their interests.

1757
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And I saw that I was something about the culture that the highest level of acceptance

1758
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
was the people that wanted to go on and be university and college professors.

1759
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So that helped.

1760
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
And then I was pointed in that direction.

1761
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
But when I went to Arizona and started teaching medical students,

1762
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I realized that biochemistry in that context is a lot different.

1763
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:23,000
And my father had actually never actually conveyed to me the intellectual stimulation of medicine

1764
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
as a multi-depart metal scientific activity.

1765
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
It was partly, he was in practice.

1766
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
He was an internist.

1767
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:39,000
But a lot of his patients were, it did have routine troubles that didn't give him much stimulation.

1768
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
So he didn't convey that part of it.

1769
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:48,000
But once I had to learn to teach biochemistry in a way that medical students would accept.

1770
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And once I started interacting with MD college, I realized that medicine is a lot different from what I thought I was.

1771
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And so at some point after I had been there a few years, early 70s,

1772
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I read that the University of Miami had created a fast track MD program for PhDs in the biomedical sciences.

1773
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
You could finish a MD degree in a year and a half to two years.

1774
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I was pretty interested in this.

1775
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
So I applied for it.

1776
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And it was accepted.

1777
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
And then I went to talk to the department chairman.

1778
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
The idea being that one of the years, I could get partial support by being on sabbatical lead.

1779
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
And then we'd use it on resource for the rest.

1780
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
And when I told him about it, he looked though he'd been kicked in the stomach.

1781
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And then he talked to my colleagues, which I always felt was improper.

1782
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I thought that my conversation was just one or one.

1783
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But after a week, he said that the department decided they really didn't want me to do this.

1784
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Well, obviously I could have done it anyway.

1785
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But I would have had to resign.

1786
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I could have resigned.

1787
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And I thought it over.

1788
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And by that time our children were dating 10, we were pretty well settled and two son.

1789
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And there wasn't any, and I enjoyed what I was doing.

1790
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
There wasn't any real, there wasn't any reason that I had to do this.

1791
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
But I've always wondered what it would have been like if I'd had a career in medicine.

1792
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
What would I have gone into medical research?

1793
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
What would I have been a primary land in practice?

1794
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
What would I have gotten the intellectual stimulation?

1795
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Would I have enjoyed the kind of bread the awareness of what's happening in cutting edge science?

1796
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And all the rest of it would be nice if you could live two lives.

1797
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
But that's something I just have to live with, I guess.

1798
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
So obviously we're also very proud of our two children.

1799
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Lawrence, who was, as I said, was born very shortly after our marriage.

1800
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
And then, and it was born a couple years later.

1801
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Lawrence ended up going to the University of Washington for a PhD in biochemistry.

1802
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
So he was in the same department I was.

1803
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And the department had changed a lot since then.

1804
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
He's now out of science, but he got a great start to his career.

1805
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
He did a postdoc in Sweden, and then a second postdoc in the sockets to it.

1806
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,000
And he did a piece of work that made him quite well known.

1807
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
And he had, he had four excellent faculty offers.

1808
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And he was in a system professor at the University of Michigan for several years.

1809
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
And he had an epiphany.

1810
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
And now he's a teacher in the Walter school system.

1811
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And we'll go into detail about that.

1812
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:48,000
He is much happier doing that than ever was as a university faculty member.

1813
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
And our daughter graduated from Oregon State with a degree in psychology.

1814
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And no clue to what she wanted to do.

1815
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And she happened to talk to a naval recruiter on campus.

1816
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And ended up going to naval officer candidates school after she graduated and becoming an

1817
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Anson. And she did very well in the Navy.

1818
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:17,000
But she ended up secretly getting married to an unlisted and under her command.

1819
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And that was a no-no in the Navy.

1820
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And when they found out they were both in trouble.

1821
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And again, making a long story short, they both left the Navy.

1822
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And the Ann was in the reserve.

1823
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
She got promoted in the reserve.

1824
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
So she was in good standing as far as the Navy was concerned.

1825
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
But they had two children.

1826
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And she was basically soccer mom.

1827
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
And two daughters were in college.

1828
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And then she went back.

1829
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And got a degree as a as a paralegal assistant.

1830
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
So she's working at field.

1831
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So both of our children are doing things.

1832
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
They enjoy great deal.

1833
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
