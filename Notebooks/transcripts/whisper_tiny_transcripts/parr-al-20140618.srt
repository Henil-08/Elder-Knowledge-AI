1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, I'll if you could please introduce yourself, your name and today's date in our location.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm Albert C. PAR, where we're at our home in Gresham, Oregon.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
On these two to Avenue, and the date I'd be was the 18th, 18th of June 2014.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Terrific. Well, we'll start at the beginning. You were born in, is it Tulea?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tulea?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Tulea?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So what was your family doing there?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My dad was working in the copper mines and a big army depot.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Tulea was ordered in St. Paul during World War II.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And after the war ended, he decided he wanted to leave Utah and move up to Oregon,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where his brother was, his family was in Rosberg.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So we moved to Rosberg. I think in 1946, something like that,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
for 46 or early 47.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that's why I want to, all my schooling and group there in Rosberg.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Did you have siblings?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, I have one brother, and we're no longer brother, and a sister

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that's four years younger. And they both live in the state.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A sister lived in Canby, my brother lived in that lake,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
grew over Lake Oswego.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So your dad was in the copper mines originally, but I didn't understand

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
he was in the forest products industry.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, he worked in the saw mills and plywood mills in the Rosberg area.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And eventually ran a film station for a while,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and some other things just sort of retired as a handyman,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and we can't, it's place in Rosberg.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Growing up in Rosberg, did you have any,

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
did you have memories of the timber culture at that time?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, there was a lot of, you know, that's what

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
made the world hummed down there.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And in those days, there were still hearing a lot of those,

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you know, first of all the trees,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and it would be Douglas Firso, and you'd take up a whole logging truck

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that diameter would be.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And you'd see those coming down the road,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and the roads are certainly very primitive up in the mountains,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
a lot of them, or we'd scrap them out, pay it,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it was very primitive, but that was almost exclusive to me.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's also a big farming industry in Rosberg,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the Garden Valley, a vegetable farming,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
can't load beans, that sort of thing.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I remember a lot of those kids,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and during high school, high school worked in the farms,

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the valleys are in the Rosberg area.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Like that's why I started working in the farming areas,

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
to say about money and good work in the state.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So what kinds of jobs did you do?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, I started in junior high school picking beans,

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the pole beans, and then eventually,

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that was by a propound sort of job,

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and then eventually I got a job by the hour,

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
a sort of an overseer of that,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and also the, you know, in the early summers,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and run in camel fields.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then the guy worked for a headrock 25 acres of camel open,

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
to meet those instructors, that sort of thing,

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and I would work all from me,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to bring on through the late summer,

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we fall after school on weekends for the farmers.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Was there much market labor in the area at that time?

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Not much at all, very, very little.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In fact, that's why the school base,

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to run the school buses downtown,

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and all kids out to work in the fields,

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and I don't think that's done anymore.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think the children don't want to work out in the hot sun,

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but that's what it used to be done,

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
back in the 50s and 60s,

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
before that.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was getting to get yourself into the school

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and run school buses,

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but a little bit of the various bean fields,

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and then you work all day to bring you back to the school,

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and you could get yourself home somehow.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When do you remember about,

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to your dad's work in the sun,

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I mean, what was that typical work experience like for him, you know?

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was very hard work,

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and, you know,

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
of course the mills were not air conditioned

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
or heated during any of that nature.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And so it was hard, it was hard,

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and not the safest thing in those days either.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But it was very labor intensive.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You know, all the wallwork was done by hand,

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and, you know, of course, power solves that sort of thing.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But you're walking to a modern plywood mill,

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
you know, there's very few people,

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and it's all automated.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But in those days, everything was,

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it was done by hand,

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
including making the plywood sheet, you know,

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
later by a layer.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Like I had a job on summer after in college,

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
working in plywood mill,

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it was my job to make the plywood.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It started out with, you know,

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the big flat piece,

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the four-way piece that put the,

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
a machine just spit out glued to cross pieces

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to even slap those down somewhere

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and then flop another sheet saw.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And in the building, you physically built the piece

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
of plywood with your hands,

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and then stacked them up and put them in

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a big hop, pressed and pressed them,

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and started another batch.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But it was all hand labor you see.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Including, you know,

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
they do it with the glue pieces,

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and all parts of the process were had.

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So they put a lot of people,

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
compared to what now they do.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sounds a little repetitious.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, it's boring,

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but it was good money, you know,

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
for a kid in those days.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How much you might have of us here back down?

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She was a school teacher,

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and so since we moved to Jerusalem,

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
she got a job in a,

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and looking glass or a teaching there in looking glass,

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and would go out there every day during the school year.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so we were very young,

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so we were,

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
we would often have baby citizen, that sort of thing.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then eventually she moved to the Rosbury School System

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and retired for 30 years or whatever.

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How was Rosbury going up for you?

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I loved it.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was a, it was a, you know,

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
a safe place to be,

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and a lot of friends there still do,

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so have my rotary contacts.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And we, I liked it the weather was nice,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and it's a lovely place to live.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And it was of course a small town,

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
but I have to be a very fond memories of it.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A really great place.

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Schools were good,

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and it's, everything to,

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
everything to recommend it in my mind.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What were your hobbies as a biology do for fun?

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was pretty busy working.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We lived on a small farm,

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
so we had a lot animals that always had pigs and chickens,

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and now occasionally a cow on a steer,

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and that sort of thing.

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So it was busy with that sort of thing,

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and then hobbies as a guy over was cars.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Got real interested in hot rod racing,

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and much of it was being runny,

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
hot rod, you'd see back in the 50s,

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and drag race on the roads,

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and that sort of thing.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It had a good time, but it was entertaining.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was a nice place to grow up.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How about your experience at school?

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Rosbury had good schools in those days,

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and I presumably still do,

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and so I learned what I was,

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for a few years,

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a few years in my school,

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't take school very seriously,

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and I got by,

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but then nothing to brag about academic excellence.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But time I got to high school,

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and later on,

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and I started taking school,

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and were seriously worked on getting to grades,

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and that sort of thing.

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But again, they were very tolerant,

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and as active in student government in high school,

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and so on.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I had a good time.

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I enjoyed looking back with high school with great fondness.

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I saw a lot of friends from the Rosbury graduating class,

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and I see them in fact.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was just talking to one on the phone this morning,

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and everybody from Rosbury.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Your friendship lasted,

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it started in life,

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to the last of the lifetime,

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
different from your high school experience.

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They seem education was an emphasis in your family,

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I heard from the time I was very small.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You want to work hard so you can go to college,

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and my dad would always say,

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
so you don't have to work in the mills like I have to work.

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And once you work in the mills,

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
you could see what he meant.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And so it was a good influence

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
working in the mills,

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and hard labor on the farms.

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There might be a better career,

196
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
or perhaps more,

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
in terms of ease,

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but also security,

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because the mills are always having strikes

200
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
before the union really got strong,

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and then people get laid off,

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and it was not the most secure environment.

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So a lot of anxiety,

204
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but from my father and the other parents as well,

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
because of the changing nature of the scene,

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in terms of the mills,

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and who is all who owned this when they buy some mills,

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and everybody get fired,

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and so on,

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and it was,

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I couldn't understand why my father was always apprehensive.

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It was an uncertain time.

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How did you develop your interest in science?

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was always fairly good at it.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I wrote a math,

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and then science things always came easy to me.

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It just, I think,

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
one of my buddies,

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and I did well at it,

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and I just got,

221
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was always interested in how things work.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I built radios from time,

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was like a teenager,

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and you got interested in radios that led in the interest,

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you know,

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and physics and electronics.

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I always had that interest in high school.

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then when I went on to college,

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was the first thing I thought about as having a major,

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
in terms of physics and math.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So it just,

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think,

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
things sort of select you by your abilities.

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Some people have great musical skills,

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and other kinds of skills,

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
language skills,

237
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and there's some of us who have math and science skills,

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and just attributes and interests too,

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and from bliever,

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and there's dispositions and characteristics of people

241
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that allow them to succeed.

242
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because some people,

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
no matter how hard they were,

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
have a very difficult time on mathematics.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I would see that when I was teaching,

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and there wasn't that they were,

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you know,

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
necessarily stupid people or any of that in nature,

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
just that they didn't have those particular abilities

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and traps and interests with abilities.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So people tend to end up,

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think, and things,

253
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
if they're going to be successful,

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
if they have good abilities.

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I thought that's what worked out for me.

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Was there anybody who during your high school time

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
was a mentor for you,

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
or somebody who got interested in these things

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
or didn't sort of memorize from what then?

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I had a series of very good science teachers,

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or high school physics teachers,

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and chemistry teachers,

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and math teachers I might add,

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that always encouraged,

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and encouraged the students,

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and kept you on the straightener and turned to the warning,

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and did a good job.

268
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I think the,

269
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I had the benefit of a bunch of good teachers,

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
so most of the more veterans from World War II,

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the ones I can remember,

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
had gotten to school on the GI Bill,

273
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and went into education.

274
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They were really excellent teachers,

275
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a lot of them.

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So benefit to our students.

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We went to Oregon State College,

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
beginning in 1960.

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How did you decide to go to OSC?

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I had a scholarship from the,

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
from the Navy,

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and it was in our OTC scholarships,

283
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and that was the place

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
that had that program.

285
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm also I wanted to major in a science program,

286
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
sort of state was a natural choice,

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and they had the,

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
in our OTC scholarship as well.

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it's a,

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
a confluence of events,

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and interest as well as,

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that's what the scholarship aid was.

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Were you in our OTC in high school?

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, no, no, not at all.

295
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But they was one of those exams you take,

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and you selected,

297
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and so on,

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and that was a competitive fact.

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that was part of your experience,

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
then in college was being in,

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in that era too.

302
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
In our OTC.

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, yes.

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
As I was in that for two and a half years,

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
then I decided that it would be better for me

306
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to continue in science,

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and to continue as a naval officer.

308
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And just a rule from that program,

309
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
just to set my time in science program.

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What did that program entail for you?

311
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The Navy program.

312
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It would entail the summer cruises.

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
After your freshman year,

314
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you went on,

315
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you know, camped,

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and then some other places.

317
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
After the sophomore year,

318
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
we went to Texas for a while,

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and Air Force based on the Corpus Christi,

320
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then another month or so at San Diego.

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And so it's a good experience.

322
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I really think well those experiences in the Navy,

323
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in the summer programs.

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And then if I had stayed in the program

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
the third year,

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
after your junior year,

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you'd be going to onboard a ship.

328
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And some sort of capacity.

329
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I never, never went that far.

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I put some part of my junior year.

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Was there training during this school year to you?

332
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

333
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
To the regular RCZ program.

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think it was, you had to regular class three times a week.

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then one day,

336
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
there was a drill,

337
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
where you had to breathe out.

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It was a marching-out side down there.

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
All those fields are,

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
other buildings,

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
there's down there,

342
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the quance of that building really.

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's still the same building,

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know if I could've done that by the Colosseum,

345
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and then so forth.

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was the same building then,

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and those were all world war two quance of us.

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's amazing.

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's still standing.

350
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
With all those fields are all vacant.

351
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There's not a lot of the development.

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That would be out there marching,

353
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
mostly it's same.

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There used to be quite a few of those quance of that,

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so I can't put some trees off.

358
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But what do you remember about,

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to sort of your first impressions

361
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
of college and, of course, Alice?

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I liked it.

363
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I was,

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
when I got there,

365
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was selected to go into some sort of,

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
they were trying some living arrangement programs.

367
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And they were also getting started

368
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
with the Colosseum Honors Program at that time.

369
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I was enrolled in that,

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and they put people in that Honors Program,

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
which was your freshman,

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
the whole four on the,

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the first four of Coffern Hall,

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I believe,

375
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
he was Coffern Hall,

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the first four were the people

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that were chosen for this Honors Program,

378
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and they encouraged extra cultural activities

379
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and they had advisors in and so forth.

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And I was,

381
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
pretty much a,

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
pretty nice bunch of,

383
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
of Alice who would,

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you know,

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
well fairly successful in high school.

386
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There were,

387
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
then,

388
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
select the first,

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
this Honors Program arrangement.

390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know if they still do that,

391
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and I have my idea,

392
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
but it was a,

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was a,

394
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
introductory program,

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
so the people that we were,

396
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
my roommates and then the people,

397
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and the whole were,

398
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
pre-selected out by,

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
by someone in the university,

400
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as part of this Honors Program,

401
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
a test to have the better students

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and one location.

403
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The people they perceived would be better,

404
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
so they ultimately turned out or not,

405
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know,

406
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
but that was the idea at the time.

407
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And there was extra curriculum activities as well.

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, and then the Honors Program,

409
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
you took an addition to your regular courses,

410
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
there was at least one seminar a week,

411
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
a small,

412
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
small bunch of people,

413
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
sometimes one on one,

414
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with one of the professors at working on projects.

415
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I found that very beneficial.

416
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I worked with,

417
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
a,

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
a biology,

419
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
a botany,

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and a botany professor wants,

421
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and physics professors,

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and into biology.

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So it was,

424
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it was,

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it was an interesting time,

426
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and did that every year for your whole four years.

427
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then you would,

428
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
when you graduated,

429
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
to get a Honors Designation on your,

430
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
on your diploma.

431
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Interesting,

432
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
see you're helping assist with their researches.

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, you would do,

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and then do a little projects on your own,

435
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
yeah.

436
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And it was,

437
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
it was,

438
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
it was always sort of interesting.

439
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then just talk about,

440
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you know,

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
their field of research,

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and they try to learn a little bit a little bit about it.

443
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What was that?

444
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It was a broadening experience.

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

446
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But you got to work sort of one-on-one with,

447
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
with the faculty members.

448
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Or in some cases,

449
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
as my physics program is working with a senior graduate student,

450
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but come in once in twice a week,

451
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and we were working on projects that,

452
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the physics program.

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah,

454
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that's,

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm interested to be here.

456
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Talk about this though.

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There was,

458
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I've done that on this program.

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Apparently it started right around the new started.

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It was cut,

461
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
as a result,

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
about major five in the early 90s.

463
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then was replaced by the University of Honors College,

464
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
which came about five years later.

465
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It sounds like it's a little different.

466
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

467
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But your experience was.

468
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah.

469
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There was,

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you,

471
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in some of the classes were segregated

472
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
in terms of the people in the Honors program.

473
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But by and large,

474
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you just met with everybody else,

475
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and did these extra things.

476
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You know,

477
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
with the seminars,

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you just go,

479
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
one or three hours,

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
seminar,

481
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
credit course,

482
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and get credit for that as well.

483
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It was a,

484
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
main experience was being able to work with,

485
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
one on one of the,

486
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
with a,

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with a researcher,

488
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
some sort of,

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and,

490
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
explore new areas,

491
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
so it was a very beneficial.

492
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So when you went to college,

493
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
as you have a sense of what you wanted to do,

494
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
in terms of your studies,

495
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
because,

496
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
as I turn that out,

497
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
you took,

498
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
looked at your academic records,

499
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
about a lot of classes,

500
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and to get two degrees and four years.

501
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Was that your plan from the beginning?

502
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I sort of liked it,

503
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
because I was,

504
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the,

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the math,

506
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and the physics were,

507
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
happened to be easy for me,

508
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and the things that caused me to trouble were,

509
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the form language requirements,

510
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and that was really hard for me.

511
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I spent probably more time on French,

512
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
when I was taking it,

513
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and then I,

514
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
then I did on the physics courses,

515
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
because it's just different abilities.

516
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But,

517
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
no,

518
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I just,

519
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
it took as much as I could,

520
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and I also liked the math courses,

521
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but I'd taken a lot of math

522
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
in high school,

523
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and you know,

524
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
really liked it.

525
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I had some good professors, too,

526
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
at both departments.

527
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It was a fun environment.

528
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I looked back on my days,

529
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
both at undergraduate and graduate school,

530
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
with great farmers,

531
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because I enjoyed it,

532
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and it was hard work,

533
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and so forth.

534
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It was a really nice time you were doing something,

535
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you really wanted to do,

536
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and able to do,

537
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and sort of free from the,

538
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
necessities that happened to make a living otherwise,

539
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and work in a workplace and so on.

540
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It was a time of your life,

541
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and a prolonged time in my case,

542
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
because I went on the graduate school.

543
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We were doing exactly what you wanted to do.

544
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And that's a,

545
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that's a real good feeling.

546
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's very, very good for the soul.

547
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Did you have a sense of a particular specialty

548
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
within math or physics,

549
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
at that point in your life,

550
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
or that point?

551
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I didn't know,

552
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but the,

553
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and then in fact,

554
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the curriculum was sort of everybody took the same thing.

555
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There were a few electors like in physics,

556
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you could take it.

557
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Maybe into me,

558
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you're all as you're something of that nature.

559
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Or ocean sciences was getting started back

560
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
that some people would maybe take a few of that,

561
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but by and large,

562
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
the physics curriculum was pretty well fixed.

563
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And since I was getting a math major too,

564
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I didn't have a lot of a slot

565
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I had to take the,

566
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the required courses,

567
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and to fill the,

568
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the social science requirements as well.

569
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think that PE requirements in those days too,

570
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you had to take some of your classes out.

571
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, I don't know if it was still current when you were in school,

572
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and you used to have to learn how to swim

573
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in order to graduate.

574
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, and that was,

575
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that was,

576
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
yeah, you had to take a swimming course

577
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
in those days,

578
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and I,

579
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I always thought it was awful.

580
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There,

581
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
there's no swimming suit,

582
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you swim moon.

583
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I thought that was just a trotious.

584
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean,

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
there's no earthly sense in it.

586
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There was just some very peculiar people

587
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
who were in the swim program,

588
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and I was letting the department.

589
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think that was my,

590
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that was always my opinion,

591
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
just strange folks.

592
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You're not the first person to say that to me.

593
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But were there any professors that made

594
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a particular impact upon you?

595
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can think of it.

596
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah,

597
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
like the entomology professor I worked with,

598
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
John Latton,

599
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I believe,

600
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
was the same,

601
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
was very influential.

602
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It got me interested in,

603
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
in philosophy,

604
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in science,

605
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and a whole range of things,

606
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
so that we're in a very little

607
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
about it tomorrow,

608
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but a little bit.

609
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And we had some good professors

610
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in the physics department,

611
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and enjoyed that a great deal.

612
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They were good,

613
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because they were student focused,

614
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and he really got a chance

615
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to have a lot of experiences

616
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
directly with the teachers.

617
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah,

618
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Latton also was a book lecture.

619
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh,

620
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I didn't know that,

621
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
at the time out.

622
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah,

623
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
did you work while you were in school?

624
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah,

625
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Assump,

626
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
the NROTC program,

627
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
kept me pretty busy,

628
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
but also,

629
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Liedron helped by grading papers,

630
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and that sort of thing

631
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
for both the math department

632
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and the physics department.

633
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And that was a small amount of money,

634
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but it actually helped.

635
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But it was primarily

636
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in being grading papers,

637
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and acting as sort of a assistant to some professor.

638
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And that sort of,

639
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I didn't,

640
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
you're working a restaurant or any of that sort of thing.

641
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well,

642
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
when you were studying physics,

643
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
especially,

644
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm just didn't know about the technologies

645
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that were important to students at that point.

646
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Well,

647
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
we had the technology of the 50s,

648
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and in early 60s,

649
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and so there were,

650
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
there were a lot of old-heal-packered

651
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and tectonics measuring equipment,

652
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that sort of thing,

653
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and the optic stuff,

654
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
was all the classical optics material.

655
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well,

656
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
a lot of that's probably still,

657
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
still the same because things like optics

658
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
haven't been in the introduction of the laser,

659
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and so that tectonics haven't changed that much.

660
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So the lens is,

661
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and that sort of thing,

662
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you know,

663
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
probably the same knowledge,

664
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
so they were then.

665
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So they had,

666
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think,

667
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
well, a quick laboratory,

668
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
isn't for the time.

669
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And it was,

670
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
it was good.

671
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

672
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm always interested in knowing about the area

673
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
before computers,

674
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
because computers,

675
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
we know anyway.

676
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

677
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, there was none of that then.

678
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

679
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And it was,

680
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I,

681
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I started taking computer course,

682
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I always thought this was sort of funny,

683
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and I showed up in this class.

684
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And in terms of mostly other people,

685
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
already knew what they were doing.

686
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And, you know,

687
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so the professor was talking to them.

688
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Somebody like me,

689
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
it was just out of lunch,

690
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
eventually I just quit the course.

691
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know,

692
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
they mean you tell you where the computer was,

693
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and how you did anything.

694
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
They started talking about a bunch of stuff

695
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that they were, you know, more advanced.

696
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It wasn't an introductory course of all.

697
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Which is what was alleged to be.

698
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And so it was sort of a bad experience quite frankly.

699
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I made a introduction to the computers

700
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that they had to,

701
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
something that it worked and saved that time.

702
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I have no idea what it was.

703
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I never personally saw it.

704
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Because I got out of the business.

705
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then really get started into computers

706
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
till later in graduate school,

707
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
in very late in graduate school.

708
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then I became a,

709
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that I taught for a few years.

710
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And Alabama,

711
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we ought to start automating some of our equipment down.

712
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But it was still back then.

713
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Those those they liked.

714
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And the sixies that were still teletypes,

715
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that sort of,

716
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
kind of console.

717
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And that was,

718
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
modems them very slow.

719
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I mean,

720
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
people just wouldn't recognize it now.

721
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I mean,

722
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
it wouldn't have the patience for it.

723
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Did you see,

724
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
you lived in a dorm,

725
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
initially,

726
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
did you stay in the dorms all four years?

727
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
No,

728
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I didn't.

729
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I,

730
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't really like the dorms,

731
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
they're sort of noisy.

732
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I'm the sort of person.

733
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I really have to have a sort of quiet.

734
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And it's a little solitude.

735
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And the dorms are always very, very noisy.

736
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And so the second year,

737
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I,

738
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and a friend,

739
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
found an apartment,

740
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
over by the SAE house.

741
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's the church,

742
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
it's a church that owned a beautiful

743
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
two-story house.

744
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
They rented out parts of the for students.

745
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So my friend and I moved in and moved in there.

746
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And at that time,

747
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that wasn't,

748
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
that wasn't really allowed.

749
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I mean,

750
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you had to,

751
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
it's an undergraduate,

752
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
we're supposed to live in student approved housing.

753
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Well, this wasn't student approved housing.

754
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We just moved in there.

755
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But eventually the dean caught up with us.

756
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The dean and man,

757
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
sent us letters which we ignored,

758
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and so forth.

759
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But eventually came over.

760
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And,

761
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
not from the door.

762
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't remember his name,

763
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
but he was very nice man.

764
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And we talked to him a while.

765
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I told him I just,

766
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you know, we liked it there.

767
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And it was,

768
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and I was getting good grades and being successful.

769
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So it wasn't like we were,

770
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and the same with my roommate.

771
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We were,

772
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we're flunking out of school.

773
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Something that was actually,

774
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
can be quite successful as a living arrangement.

775
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But so he,

776
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
bless his heart.

777
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He went next door.

778
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We're a graduate student in his wife.

779
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We're living.

780
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Who I didn't know.

781
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And got them to sign that they would be

782
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
our plotters or whatever they call it.

783
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Signed that they would keep in mind.

784
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So,

785
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
we're going to be came with gentlemen housing.

786
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And I hadn't realized that it was a process

787
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
to turn a living situation

788
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
into a university recognized.

789
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But then that was the end of that.

790
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Never heard any more about it.

791
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And I stayed there for the next two years.

792
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And the third year,

793
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
we,

794
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
by finally,

795
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
we lived a roommate and I lived in a,

796
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and a,

797
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
a place called provost towers or something like that.

798
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's big old.

799
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It was a high rise building at that time.

800
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And then an important area.

801
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I mean, then the provost area.

802
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And that, that was fine too.

803
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But that first one was a sophomore when we

804
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ran into the dean.

805
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That, that had a little concern.

806
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But, you know,

807
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I was trying to do what I thought was best for me.

808
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And it turned out fine.

809
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well,

810
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
at that point,

811
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
this is still true to some degree.

812
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But at that point,

813
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the Greek system was very big on campus.

814
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And I'm wondering what it was like to,

815
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
not be part of that,

816
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
to have,

817
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to have a social life,

818
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but not necessarily being engaged with the Greek system.

819
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We're not even engaged with the Greek system.

820
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We're not much.

821
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I had some friends who were in fraternity.

822
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
In fact,

823
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I met some of the fellows that lived across the street

824
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
at the SAE house.

825
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And they were all fine.

826
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We got long fine.

827
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There's no problems.

828
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And we,

829
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
since I had,

830
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I was doing a double major in health networking.

831
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I didn't have a lot of time for socializing.

832
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And I'm not.

833
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
In those days,

834
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I didn't,

835
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
you know,

836
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
think much of party and caring on it.

837
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Like I emphasized.

838
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I liked it quite,

839
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
so I couldn't get my work done.

840
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I,

841
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I never really thought about that at the fraternity.

842
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And they were,

843
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
a little more expensive,

844
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
too,

845
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I think, to live in,

846
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
by sharing an apartment.

847
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The room was relatively small.

848
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Another kind of shared the rent.

849
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And you did a lot of own cooking in this,

850
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and food preparation.

851
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And it was really fairly inexpensive.

852
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I would,

853
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I would budget about $1,000,

854
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
maybe $100 a year to go to work in state in those days.

855
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And with a little judicious spending and care,

856
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
you could make almost that amount.

857
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And in a summary,

858
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the working on the farms,

859
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
or plywood mill,

860
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
or a saw mill,

861
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
or something,

862
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that nature,

863
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and so you could quite easily work your way through school.

864
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Of course,

865
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I had a scholarship to the first two and a half years

866
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
that paid the tuition.

867
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And I hope they gave us $50 a month,

868
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
for living to as part of that Navy program.

869
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So,

870
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you know,

871
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
small stipend.

872
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So,

873
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the financial aspects are going to college,

874
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and the,

875
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and the 60s,

876
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and so,

877
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we're just not burdensome.

878
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Almost anybody with a will

879
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
could,

880
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
could,

881
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
could go to any school that they wanted.

882
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The weather was,

883
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
yeah,

884
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oregon University of Oregon,

885
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oregon State,

886
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Southern Oregon College.

887
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Any school,

888
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
because you could work your way through fairly straightforward.

889
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Now,

890
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I think that's not a quite probable board likely,

891
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
not possible.

892
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Did you have any major extracurricular activities

893
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
that you did during college?

894
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Not much.

895
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Except the,

896
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I've played,

897
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you know,

898
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
ten of some things like this with friends,

899
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
but I didn't,

900
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
during a lot of clubs,

901
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
or anything of that nature,

902
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
because, you know,

903
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
it was pretty busy,

904
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and it focused on my,

905
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
my activities.

906
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But in a lot of friends,

907
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
we did think we'd often,

908
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you know,

909
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
have your,

910
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
your Friday night out at the bar,

911
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
down there at the peacock,

912
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
whatever reason one was barstand there,

913
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and,

914
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and have a good time,

915
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and so on.

916
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But that was it.

917
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But I didn't join,

918
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I didn't join a lot of clubs,

919
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
or anything of that nature.

920
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Any particular hangout,

921
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
besides the peacock?

922
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Not really.

923
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And,

924
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
but,

925
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
for everybody,

926
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you know,

927
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that have a few beers on their own,

928
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
it's basically,

929
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
if you've got a way to get it,

930
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
even though it's,

931
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
not a lot of legal in my respect,

932
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
but the,

933
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the students,

934
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
as always,

935
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
are interpricing,

936
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and it was never a problem.

937
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Why do I ask you about a few events

938
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
that happened at Oregon State,

939
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
when you were there at the first one?

940
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
In 1961,

941
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oregon State College became Oregon State University.

942
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That makes much of an impact on you,

943
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
giving memory of that.

944
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I have a memory of it,

945
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and I,

946
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and the people there thought was a big deal.

947
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I remember everybody being a thused about it,

948
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
because I guess,

949
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and a lot of people's minds,

950
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
the main university has more prestige

951
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and meaning than college.

952
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And I guess it does.

953
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It was,

954
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
personally at that time,

955
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I,

956
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I didn't care that much.

957
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I, as I recall,

958
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because, you know,

959
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I had known as Oregon State College OSC,

960
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you know,

961
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
as I,

962
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
last, where I applied,

963
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
it didn't mean a lot to me,

964
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
in terms of,

965
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
of later things,

966
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
because,

967
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
you know,

968
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
whether the degree,

969
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
whether the degree said,

970
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oregon State College

971
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
or State University,

972
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
to me,

973
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
it didn't mean very much.

974
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But, you know,

975
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
to some people,

976
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I can,

977
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I can understand it.

978
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It didn't mean a lot to them.

979
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Because I think,

980
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
in the,

981
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
in the academic hierarchy,

982
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
being called a university,

983
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
it's,

984
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
it's more meaningful,

985
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and,

986
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you know,

987
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
college,

988
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it's more restricted term,

989
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
doesn't imply the research

990
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and graduate programs,

991
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and so forth,

992
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
that you,

993
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you think of it in terms of the university.

994
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And I think that was,

995
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that was the goal, of course.

996
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
In October of 1962,

997
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
as the Columbus State Storm,

998
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you remember that?

999
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Bigly,

1000
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
yeah.

1001
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And, you know,

1002
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
it's a,

1003
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a bad storm.

1004
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And,

1005
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and I,

1006
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
didn't affect me in any way,

1007
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you know,

1008
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
directly,

1009
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
we didn't lose any,

1010
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
any of our homework,

1011
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
any of that nature,

1012
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
you know,

1013
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
in progress,

1014
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
like the parents' rules,

1015
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
we've been having problems.

1016
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And so I didn't,

1017
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it didn't,

1018
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
drastically,

1019
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
drastically affect me in any way,

1020
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
then pay attention to it.

1021
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Well,

1022
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't get it,

1023
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
you're a big football fan,

1024
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but Terry Baker,

1025
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
when the high central fee in 1962,

1026
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
as well,

1027
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
you remember the,

1028
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
yeah.

1029
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
There was a lot of who planned,

1031
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and he was a great athlete,

1032
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
because he was a,

1033
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
he started in the basketball,

1034
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
basketball as well.

1035
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And,

1036
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
yeah,

1037
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I didn't know in person,

1038
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
of course,

1039
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but he was famous in his own time.

1040
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And I used to go to football games,

1041
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and the,

1042
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think the students got in,

1043
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you know,

1044
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
freer,

1045
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
or almost nothing.

1046
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If it was,

1047
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it was a game,

1048
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and I,

1049
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you know,

1050
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
it's not otherwise engaged.

1051
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I didn't try to get down to watch,

1052
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
right?

1053
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I enjoyed football.

1054
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's the one sport I do care for.

1055
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I do ball or baseball fan that much.

1056
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I do like football.

1057
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And so,

1058
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I go to some of the games,

1059
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
but,

1060
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and all the football associated with it.

1061
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So, I enjoyed,

1062
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I enjoyed the athletic team.

1063
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah.

1064
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well,

1065
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
what was your sense of course,

1066
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll set the time,

1067
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
at somewhat smaller place than it is now,

1068
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
obviously.

1069
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Any particular relationship with the town?

1070
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I,

1071
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I like core balance.

1072
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It was the,

1073
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
the people,

1074
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and the,

1075
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
there was no crime to speak of.

1076
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And,

1077
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you know,

1078
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I,

1079
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I dreamed my bicycle outside in,

1080
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
in my house or the apartment where I lived.

1081
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I,

1082
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I,

1083
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I never had a stall in,

1084
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and this sort of thing.

1085
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And,

1086
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I never had a stalling from,

1087
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
from the building or anything like that.

1088
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So,

1089
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
yeah,

1090
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I enjoyed,

1091
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I had no negative memories of it at all.

1092
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Of course,

1093
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it's a lovely campus.

1094
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I always thought,

1095
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
or you can say,

1096
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it had a truly lovely campus in the spring,

1097
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
whatever things in bloom,

1098
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and the landscaping is really, really nice.

1099
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And,

1100
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
in those days,

1101
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
they didn't have all those,

1102
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
cut streets,

1103
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
all the streets went through.

1104
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And,

1105
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
you didn't have all the,

1106
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
uh,

1107
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
limited access that you have now.

1108
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And,

1109
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but parking was pretty critical.

1110
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean,

1111
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
it was not easy.

1112
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
When I,

1113
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I lived in my apartment,

1114
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
there was no problem with that.

1115
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
In the dorm,

1116
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
we had to park way down there by,

1117
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
past the tennis courts,

1118
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
where the,

1119
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
call it seem to walk across the fields,

1120
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and so forth.

1121
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
There was no parking close by.

1122
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So,

1123
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
it was inconvenient for some of that cars in those days.

1124
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But, uh,

1125
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
yeah,

1126
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it was, I like,

1127
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
probably also,

1128
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
it's a lovely little town.

1129
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And, uh,

1130
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it's a sort of,

1131
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
a nicer place to live in,

1132
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
or I ended up going to graduate school

1133
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
in the South Chicago.

1134
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean,

1135
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
night and day.

1136
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I was sure.

1137
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah.

1138
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm sure of that.

1139
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Well,

1140
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
that brings us to this sort of

1141
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the next section of your life.

1142
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He graduated in 1964 from Oregon State.

1143
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
How did you decide what you're going to do next?

1144
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, I had decided back in,

1145
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
in my junior year when I got out of the Navy,

1146
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that out of the NRTC program,

1147
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that I wanted to go on to,

1148
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
to get a degree of PhD in physics,

1149
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and,

1150
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and,

1151
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and do research,

1152
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and work at research labs,

1153
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
so I really liked that.

1154
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And so I applied to graduate school.

1155
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And I had,

1156
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
was interested in that,

1157
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
uh,

1158
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
after getting away from the West Coast,

1159
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
so applied to the Irish Chicago,

1160
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and a couple of schools out of the West here.

1161
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I remember,

1162
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
like Berkeley and University of Washington.

1163
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And I got accepted by the University of Chicago,

1164
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and they offered me a research of fellowship

1165
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and a citizenship.

1166
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So that covered the education,

1167
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
of course they paid the tuition to.

1168
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So I was able to go to the University of Chicago,

1169
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you know,

1170
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
asked about how I finished,

1171
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we saved up a little money.

1172
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But that's why I met my wife, too,

1173
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
as I had Chicago.

1174
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And in 1966.

1175
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So,

1176
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it was,

1177
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
it was,

1178
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
it was a play,

1179
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I chose Chicago,

1180
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
it's one of the reasons it's a good school.

1181
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And,

1182
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the financial aid package was very generous, I thought.

1183
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And it was a different part of the country.

1184
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It was interesting to,

1185
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you know,

1186
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
move out to another part of the country.

1187
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And what's certainly different,

1188
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I mean, it was a real lesson to me.

1189
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Never having been to Chicago.

1190
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I didn't interview the school where he liked that.

1191
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I got accepted,

1192
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
at a rule of 57 Dodge Station,

1193
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
working at the time.

1194
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I loaded up all my stuff,

1195
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and drove across Montana,

1196
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and I'm down into Chicago.

1197
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And,

1198
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
right there,

1199
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and I wondered,

1200
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
you know,

1201
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm going to survive,

1202
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
because it's a very different environment.

1203
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah.

1204
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Tell me about that transition.

1205
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're living in a major city,

1206
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
living in a kind of a rough part of a major city.

1207
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

1208
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It was,

1209
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
you know,

1210
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the South Chicago was in a transition

1211
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
from,

1212
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
a relatively quite Polish Irish community

1213
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
to primarily black or African American.

1214
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And there was,

1215
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
all those problems associated with that

1216
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
in terms of, you know,

1217
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
cultural classes,

1218
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and so you,

1219
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
you would see that frequently,

1220
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and there's a lot of racism on both sides,

1221
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
particularly as,

1222
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as,

1223
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as, as the population,

1224
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and the population profile,

1225
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and demographic change.

1226
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And these neighborhoods,

1227
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
there was a lot of trouble.

1228
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And there,

1229
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,960
with people's minds anyhow.

1230
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,200
And so it was an interesting thing.

1231
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,640
Of course, it's not exposed to an organ at all.

1232
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,840
You would have never had any idea.

1233
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,520
And so it was a joint talent, Corvalce,

1234
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
with very few minorities.

1235
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,360
At least at that time, go to Chicago

1236
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,320
or in South Chicago, somebody like me,

1237
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,560
a white person was a minority.

1238
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,120
And it was a real experience.

1239
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,440
And it gives you a perspective on how minorities

1240
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,400
in this country, with the kinds of perceptions they

1241
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,560
must have, and some of their populations, I guess,

1242
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,280
what causes trouble and anxieties.

1243
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,720
But it's a good lesson, I like, for everybody.

1244
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,280
Well, the University of Virginia, too,

1245
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
is a world-class university, University of Chicago,

1246
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,840
very high-powered in the sciences.

1247
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,480
Tell me a little bit about that atmosphere that you came into

1248
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,360
at that point.

1249
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,200
It was a very competitive, I mean,

1250
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,760
the students for all, you know, very, very bright.

1251
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,760
I remember the Chairman told me that everybody in the class

1252
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,640
had GRE scores in the 98% talent above.

1253
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,240
And they were all real, really, really successful students.

1254
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,480
It was a very competitive.

1255
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,320
Fortunately, I, with my background at Orange States,

1256
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,440
for me in Good City, I had no problems with the academics

1257
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,560
and the work at Chicago, and it was one well,

1258
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,520
and made the normal course events and graduated

1259
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,200
in six, seven years with a PhD.

1260
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,320
It was a typical time for physics in those days at Chicago.

1261
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,240
I think some of the other majors take, it was less time,

1262
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:37,880
but so I graduated in the early 1970s with a PhD.

1263
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,000
I want to ask you about a couple of people that were there,

1264
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,760
I believe, when you were there, that are big names of the first

1265
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,160
as an Indian fellow, Superb onion and Chandra Shikar.

1266
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Absolutely, he's a great professor.

1267
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I had him for a couple of classes, actually,

1268
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,520
and statistical physics and atomic molecular physics,

1269
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,880
quantum mechanics, advanced quantum mechanics.

1270
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,520
I mean, he was a brilliant teacher, and he would come in

1271
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,200
and just turn his lecture and he had perfect handwriting on the board.

1272
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,560
This was the days of chalk boards, none of this,

1273
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,520
none of this stuff, and no overhead projections,

1274
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,040
that sort of thing, was the classical blackboard

1275
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,800
where you sight him up and down and fill up a room with that.

1276
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,120
And he would start precisely on time and finish precisely

1277
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,680
on time, noise with the coherent message.

1278
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
And as last few minutes would be a summary,

1279
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,680
and then you could write all the summaries down on your notes.

1280
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,400
And then you would have the important elements of the conversation

1281
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,280
and the talk.

1282
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,760
So, no, he's a brilliant professor.

1283
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,640
Really nice person.

1284
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,600
I came as Robert Muller, I came on the Nobel Prize in 1966,

1285
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,920
while you were there, you remember that?

1286
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,240
Yes, and I knew Robert Muller,

1287
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,520
he was in the same building as why he did my research,

1288
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,680
and I would see him frequently.

1289
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,760
He was an interesting man, a brilliant, brilliant chemist

1290
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,360
physicist, and he took from molecular physics,

1291
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,800
and he had a whole bunch of students, and then,

1292
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,360
post, I see, he had a large enterprise in those days,

1293
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,200
doing, in fact, classical speed, theoretical physics,

1294
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
and so on.

1295
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,960
But he was a real quiet man, and he was already all

1296
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,360
by the time I got to know him, and I didn't have any classes

1297
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,200
from him.

1298
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,360
But he didn't teach much.

1299
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,320
He was all up to 100% research, and, of course,

1300
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,920
trapped in a lot, because he was a world-favorite,

1301
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,040
but he had a dozens of people working in his laboratories,

1302
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,320
and they rire some hall there,

1303
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,880
if the University of Calgary was there.

1304
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,560
Well, it sounds like it tremendously enriching

1305
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,480
environment, and if you tell me about this,

1306
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,560
or the progression of your academic courses,

1307
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,680
there, your research time.

1308
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,920
Yeah, I worked, I had my first shoot up there,

1309
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,760
and then the fall of the 64, I was assigned

1310
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,440
to work for Professor Mark Ingram, who did

1311
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,360
mass spectrometry and in chemical physics,

1312
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,400
and various sorts of instrumentations

1313
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,800
looking at properties of the topic, and like the systems.

1314
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,040
And I worked in his lab as a research assistant

1315
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,600
for the first couple years, and in Chicago,

1316
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,200
they had a, you had to take physics courses,

1317
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,560
and then think of that nature as well as preparing

1318
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
for what they call an interesting exam,

1319
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,840
or the candidate exam.

1320
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,320
We usually took that at the starting year,

1321
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
and the fall of your second year.

1322
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,920
That was a very, very hard test, the qualifier.

1323
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,880
And so the first year graduate students

1324
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,400
would spend huge amounts of time studying old tests

1325
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,080
and problems, because there was a three-day test,

1326
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,800
you know, with all problems.

1327
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,760
I mean, it was another small little guess

1328
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,360
that was all problems to solve, and all areas of physics.

1329
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,880
And so you had to be well prepared, and so on.

1330
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,720
Unfortunately, I passed out the first time through,

1331
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,440
and I was able to get my research started,

1332
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,520
and I was also a test for a lot of people

1333
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,320
didn't make it the first time they'd have to take away

1334
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,680
six months of year and take it again.

1335
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,800
And then a lot, and some people just laughed,

1336
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,800
it was so daunting that they just laughed.

1337
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,480
But that's like a lot of universities

1338
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,280
have those sort of qualifying exams,

1339
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,680
and it's a hurdle at all, all people starting

1340
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,200
for an advanced degree have to overcome.

1341
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,720
But it was, it was taxing, it occupied a huge amount

1342
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,880
of your time, and it was a study, and then

1343
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,160
to learn a material about it to pass those exams.

1344
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,800
It was rewarding, too, because there was a focus

1345
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,960
of your attention, and you really did learn a lot.

1346
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
I mean, if you took the right attitude,

1347
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,360
so it was been a very, very beneficial process,

1348
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,800
as far as I can say.

1349
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,920
So I'm in favor of difficult exams.

1350
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,480
I think that it focuses as one's attention,

1351
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,240
and it enables you to really, really do the learns

1352
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
of what's the thing as well.

1353
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,160
Then I worked up, if I passed this qualifier exam,

1354
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,040
then you could start a PhD program.

1355
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,760
You couldn't formally struggle to be passed

1356
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,800
at qualifiers, so you have to find some professors

1357
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,200
that were taking on, and then you have some research project

1358
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
that you wanted to do.

1359
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,720
And I chose to say where the guy had worked

1360
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,760
as a research assistant, because I was interested

1361
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,800
in the physics and then in the programs that he had.

1362
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,600
And he also used a really nice generous man,

1363
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,600
and he had a, you know, a fire-shaped graduate student

1364
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,440
in a couple postdocs, and it was a good learning environment.

1365
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,760
So I elected to stay there and worked on some problems

1366
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,680
and in full runization.

1367
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
We had machines that would generate vacuumals

1368
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,080
for a while of radiation, and use that radiation

1369
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,640
with monocrovers, dispersant, and use that radiation

1370
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,200
to study atomic and molecular systems, you know,

1371
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,720
ionize them, and use the mass spectrometer

1372
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,960
or electron spectrovers depending on

1373
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,520
to analyze those reaction products from the ionization process.

1374
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,960
And it's so that things like cross-sections,

1375
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,640
and so forth, for the reactions,

1376
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,360
photon, atom, and molecule reactions.

1377
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,360
And my work that did was to look at ionization processes

1378
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,120
in rare earth elements, the lanthanides,

1379
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,880
so things like erropium and terbium, erbium,

1380
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,320
and things of that nature.

1381
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,440
We generated ovens, they're all metals,

1382
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
that room temperature, so you have to make an oven,

1383
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,640
and generate a atomic beam, all this is in vacuum, of course.

1384
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,960
The generate a beam of those, and intersect that beam

1385
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,720
with the light beam, and an ionization process,

1386
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,120
you start knocking off electrons.

1387
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,520
And you can melt it, and then the ion product

1388
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,440
is a function of wavelength of a light,

1389
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,880
and it determines its ionization potential,

1390
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,400
so we measured some of the ionization processes

1391
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,080
of these rare earth elements, which hadn't been done,

1392
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,680
because it was prior to its difficult.

1393
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,400
So it's so good people didn't launch spectroscopy,

1394
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,960
others, and didn't much, got much more accurate results,

1395
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,280
but those kind of experiments, and it was sort of a lot of fun.

1396
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,520
You had to build, learn how to build ovens,

1397
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,000
all high temperature ovens, and intersect that,

1398
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,680
all in a vacuum system, and intersect that with a light beam,

1399
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,280
and get the mass of a trotter, which is a relatively large instrument

1400
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,080
to measure the ion products.

1401
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,440
Then we also did some work with organic molecules,

1402
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
which were a lot easier, you just look at them,

1403
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,880
they make a big rise, and you can get a molecular beam

1404
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,840
fairly straightforward, for more organic molecules,

1405
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,080
and study their processes, and look at their dissociation processes,

1406
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,280
and well, so we did studies of various kinds of molecules

1407
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,120
so we would look at their ionizations

1408
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,760
while there's a dissociation processes.

1409
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,160
How independent were you in developing these topics?

1410
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,880
Was it something where you went to your mentor

1411
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,200
with this idea, or was it the kind of yetto way around?

1412
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,160
No, you had to, in what was the professor,

1413
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,840
and you had to develop your own topic,

1414
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,240
and then convince him that this was something to do,

1415
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
and he would support, and that's what I did.

1416
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
I was interested in these rare earths,

1417
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,200
because there was some interest in the scientific community

1418
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,680
about some of their ionization properties,

1419
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,240
and also some of the internal intake properties

1420
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
of some of the organic molecules we studied.

1421
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,560
People were interested in their internal processes,

1422
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,720
and measuring their energies, if you will.

1423
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,680
And because the internal energies of these molecules

1424
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,800
determine how they combine with others, and that's all on.

1425
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,560
And so there was interest in a given things called

1426
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,840
the heats of formation of molecular ions,

1427
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,280
and so forth that we did some studies on systems

1428
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,000
that were of interest for the kinds of chemistry,

1429
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,240
because that told you the energy balances

1430
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,440
in these ion molecule reactions.

1431
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,560
So we were engaged in that kind of research

1432
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,320
using these four ionization tools.

1433
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,000
And those days that four ionization studies was hard,

1434
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,600
because you had to have laboratory light sources,

1435
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,520
so these would be discharges, pulse discharges,

1436
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,840
with a high electrical pulse, and a capillary tube filled

1437
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,680
with a rare gas, usually, or hydrogen, in some cases.

1438
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,800
And a light helium, and then you generate the helium

1439
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,160
with get excited and generate molecular helium,

1440
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,280
which would then dissociate, because helium

1441
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,240
was an inner gas that doesn't form a molecule,

1442
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,880
except in excited states.

1443
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,400
And that dissociation process, it's a maturation

1444
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,720
in the far old devilot.

1445
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,080
So we'd use that radiation, and dispersal

1446
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,200
with the monochromorium, and sodium,

1447
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,840
or these atoms, and then the ion molecules as well.

1448
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,120
But it's subsequent, you know, by the time I left grader school,

1449
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,200
and in late 60s, and that's certainly now,

1450
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,720
and 70s on, do all in the synchrotron radiation,

1451
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,080
and also laser sources of the total supply of that.

1452
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,720
To do what we did in those days,

1453
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,120
now you go to synchrotron most likely,

1454
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,800
it would be fairly straightforward.

1455
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,600
But it was hard at that in those days,

1456
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,720
because of the technology available,

1457
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,080
we were limited to laboratory light sources.

1458
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,240
Now there's the synchrotron radiation sources

1459
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
throughout the world.

1460
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,080
In fact, I worked at the National Institute of Standards

1461
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,480
and Technology, I was the one who reasons

1462
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,880
they have a small synchrotron radiation source

1463
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,680
at the Institute, and we use that for atomic and electric

1464
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,480
physics studies.

1465
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,880
Same kinds of basic technologies

1466
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,320
as I used in graduate school, and so having these

1467
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,400
discharge light sources like a neon ball, if you will,

1468
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,280
you have these big machines that generate radiation

1469
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,640
from cyclic trion radiation.

1470
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,280
But there's faric graduate school goals,

1471
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,640
you had to devise your own projects,

1472
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,080
and then you had to publish,

1473
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,800
and then Chicago had a requirement

1474
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,240
at that time that your thesis had to be published

1475
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,960
in the peer review literature.

1476
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,320
So I had to prepare an article

1477
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,360
for the German chemical physics,

1478
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,720
and then once that was accepted, that was,

1479
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,480
then you escaped the rigors

1480
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,200
of after right of formal thesis

1481
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,480
that paper that your road got accepted

1482
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,560
in a peer review journal was basically your thesis.

1483
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,800
He just bound that, and that was it.

1484
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,200
And then you were not, after I wore these tedious

1485
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,360
thing in her page, ceases,

1486
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,000
and there's something like some places required.

1487
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,480
I thought it was a good idea, because if you start to think

1488
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,080
about it, that's what you want, your researchers

1489
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,800
to do is be able to publish in the peer review literature.

1490
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,360
So that, I thought that was always a clever

1491
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,040
and incessible criteria.

1492
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,120
And so something you had to achieve.

1493
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,760
But at least as graduate student, you're guaranteed

1494
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,200
at least having one publication,

1495
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,840
if you're going to get your degree.

1496
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,960
Whether any folks within the department

1497
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,520
that enriches being a foreign to you or memorable,

1498
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,480
besides eagering?

1499
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,960
Oh yeah, I had some classes from a famous scientist,

1500
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,560
Greg Evans, the Winsel, and he was a very, very good teacher,

1501
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,760
a no-world gentleman, I think, a swishard German,

1502
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,000
and he was one of the founders of the quantum

1503
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,720
letter dynamics, back in the 40s, and he was a teacher

1504
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,880
at Professor at Chicago at that time.

1505
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,160
And also, I learned a lot from the technical staff

1506
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,600
and the physics department of the states.

1507
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,320
They had a wonderful electronic engineer

1508
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,160
that I worked with, developed, and built an equipment,

1509
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,720
and electronics equipment.

1510
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,160
They had some wonderful people,

1511
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,000
and the machine shop, because we had to make our own equipment.

1512
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,640
We didn't go to a catalog and buy a mass spectrometer,

1513
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,080
a monochromor, you made it yourself.

1514
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,640
And so I learned machine techniques,

1515
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,920
and also got to be a fairly good heliarch welder,

1516
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,680
because we'd weld the chambers to go back

1517
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,640
and chambers together, and that sort of thing.

1518
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,480
And the guys in the shop would teach you to do all that stuff.

1519
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,520
So I thought it was fascinating.

1520
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,200
I got to do all kinds of things that got paid for

1521
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,400
as a student that I really enjoyed doing.

1522
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,560
It was a wonderful experience.

1523
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,400
I was here at Chicago, just in my mind,

1524
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,560
really, really, really, really good.

1525
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,320
And additionally, getting a family started,

1526
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,520
and so on, it was a wonderful learning experience.

1527
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,880
Did you do any teaching?

1528
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
Occasionally, I would teach a course,

1529
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,320
but not for undergraduates.

1530
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,680
I teach some courses, and people preparing

1531
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,360
for the basic exam with a qualifying exam.

1532
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,040
And assist in some of the graduate courses.

1533
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,880
But I never, I was never a teaching assistant ship

1534
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,120
and a sense of teaching the undergraduate courses,

1535
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,680
and so forth.

1536
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,960
I avoided that.

1537
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,040
And I was able to have a research assistant ship

1538
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,960
or work in the lab, and never got so much involved

1539
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,760
on the teaching side.

1540
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,040
Tell me about meeting Ruth, 1966.

1541
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,040
Well, that was interesting.

1542
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,440
So I was driving out to go to my sister's wedding,

1543
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,040
and she, I was going to bring an Indian friend

1544
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,800
of mine from India.

1545
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,400
A man and was his name.

1546
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,960
And he was going to ride with me.

1547
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,480
And we were going to share expenses.

1548
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,480
Well, he was a far clever businessman, and I was.

1549
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,160
And he determined, since I had that,

1550
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,640
it was a totally dodged stationery of the time.

1551
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,920
It was room for others.

1552
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,320
He went around, I'd been noticed to me,

1553
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,680
and solicited other writers, to go parts of the trip.

1554
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,800
One guy came all the way to Eugene.

1555
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,400
I dropped him off on Eugene, but the Ruth

1556
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,560
rude with us with a friend to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1557
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,280
And we were at him off there, and I don't mean

1558
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,600
and had some financial reasons.

1559
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,240
I don't know what it was.

1560
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,640
And so I got to be a career of people

1561
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,680
across the country to go on this trip.

1562
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,480
But the men figure, I think, men are figures.

1563
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,920
He saved us off a lot of money.

1564
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,720
And it's true that they experienced.

1565
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,080
So that's how I met Ruth and when I got back to Chicago.

1566
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,480
So I've seen her, and turned out she lived in that,

1567
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,360
and a place where I lived in an international house

1568
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,760
in Chicago, so we got together and she got married.

1569
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
And she was a student.

1570
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,560
She was an undergraduate at the time.

1571
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,960
And he said he started a family.

1572
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,360
And daughter was born there, or son was born there too.

1573
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,320
And in Chicago, in Chicago, in Chicago.

1574
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,720
So what was that like being a family man

1575
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,120
and a student at the same time?

1576
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,920
It worked out pretty well.

1577
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,680
Fortunately, my wife was real capable.

1578
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,720
And she worked at a correspondence school.

1579
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,960
They're called the American School.

1580
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,680
In fact, it was a block away from our apartment,

1581
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,600
where we went up, and so she could go get papers

1582
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,400
and great papers, and work on these correspondence courses.

1583
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,000
And that turned out a source of income, and do that at home.

1584
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,640
She didn't have to leave him in, so the trial was washed at home.

1585
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,240
And we lived in student housing that was right

1586
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,600
on campus, in the early close.

1587
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,640
So that's that worked out well.

1588
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,240
Well, you were in Chicago during turbulent times.

1589
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,240
But 68 Democratic convention is well known as being

1590
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,520
sort of an iconic moment for that time period

1591
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,400
in that location.

1592
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,760
Do you have any memories of it?

1593
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,400
It was awful.

1594
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,880
Everybody's bad behavior contributed to a really awfully

1595
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,280
event.

1596
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,680
I mean, nothing, no one can be proud of those days in my mind.

1597
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,080
And the protesters are out of line.

1598
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,280
But in the Chicago case, the police's response

1599
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
were totally out of line.

1600
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,720
And I think it was characterized as a police riot.

1601
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,080
And I think that's about right.

1602
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,920
And I'm a pretty conservative fellow.

1603
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,680
But I mean, the Chicago cops were just not the best.

1604
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,160
I hope they've changed over the years.

1605
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,360
But you know, I got shaken down twice in my use of Chicago,

1606
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,640
because I had an out of state play license plate by cops.

1607
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,480
And you want to bribe for letting me off.

1608
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,280
And it was not pleasant.

1609
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,680
I mean, but that's the way it was.

1610
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,360
And so it was not all cops, obviously.

1611
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,360
But it was a corruption in there.

1612
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,400
They were not nice to the protesters in those days.

1613
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,200
In fact, I was done never went up town

1614
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,320
to the world that the convention was.

1615
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,240
But I was just walking back from the lab one night.

1616
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,280
And there's some cop cars destroying down there by the university,

1617
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,640
looking for students to harass.

1618
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,320
And they were, you know, there was a cop,

1619
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,480
a fellow, but I could tell it was a cop by their playing

1620
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,920
clothesman.

1621
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,720
And they were thinking about harassing me.

1622
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,600
They're striking by me as I was walking.

1623
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,440
And really checking me out.

1624
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,800
And I could tell that they were not thinking

1625
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,800
good thoughts.

1626
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,040
They were down in the south side.

1627
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,200
And I suspect they wanted to get it on the actions

1628
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,840
that comrades were having downtown.

1629
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,800
And I didn't like that that the Chicago cops at that time

1630
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,960
I had to not a lot of respect for them,

1631
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,080
because of my personal experiences.

1632
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,920
Well, between work in family probably not a lot of free time,

1633
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,080
but I'm wondering if there's anything about Chicago

1634
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,760
that made a big impact on the social or cultural way.

1635
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,200
There was a lot of cultural activities.

1636
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,640
And as a student, you don't have a lot of money,

1637
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,480
but there are a lot of inexpensive things to do.

1638
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,800
The University of Chicago is not far from Lake Michigan.

1639
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,160
And so you can just walk out of the lake

1640
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,160
and have some beaches.

1641
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,440
And so forth, there was a Chicago Museum of Science

1642
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,840
industry was very close to the campus.

1643
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,400
And that was a wonderful museum.

1644
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
And we'd go there frequently.

1645
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,640
And they had forest preserves and the outskirts of Chicago.

1646
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,320
So we had big parks.

1647
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,200
And so Ruth and I, and it's been time there

1648
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,480
and it was particularly on the summer.

1649
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,680
So if you wouldn't go out there and just talk a little bit.

1650
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,080
It's a couple of the guys I worked with in the machine

1651
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,520
ists and the case of go fishing

1652
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,560
and do something that made you too.

1653
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,320
So it's an interesting environment, Chicago.

1654
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,040
It's a very different from here.

1655
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,120
And it was a real cultural shot.

1656
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,960
Another big thing.

1657
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,560
The Y57 Dodge Land drove out had a,

1658
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,360
it was an organ car, right?

1659
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,280
And so the tires were bald.

1660
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,720
And the battery was ancient.

1661
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,280
And the SISI was getting cold in November.

1662
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,800
Car went start and the first time

1663
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,160
it got a little snow on the street.

1664
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,000
You couldn't go anywhere because the tires had no tread.

1665
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,200
And of course, I had a light wind break kind of jacket.

1666
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,640
And it got cold.

1667
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,840
And so that November December was a happy time.

1668
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,680
I had to get the car out of the hood running in the litter time.

1669
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,000
And I think going the roads as well

1670
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,840
is get some clothes that were appropriate for that.

1671
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,120
That tend to be an environment when the wind's halting.

1672
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,440
So that was a real, real, real shocker.

1673
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,760
And my first quarter I had to live in in Chicago

1674
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,360
I was living in an apartment in about 20 or 30

1675
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,400
blocks from what the university was.

1676
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,680
So I had to drive back and forth to school.

1677
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,400
And I soon rectified that I got a room

1678
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,080
at the International House for the second, third quarter

1679
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,800
is that the first year.

1680
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,240
And we'll see if we'll walk back and forth

1681
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,480
to campus because driving in the winter with an older car

1682
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,640
is not the best way to get around.

1683
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,120
It was in terrible inconvenience.

1684
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,920
And also parking problems and cities of this bad move.

1685
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
Of course, I hadn't realized that my first

1686
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,760
appliance Chicago had been smart to arrange housing

1687
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,640
in advance.

1688
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,440
I assume it was like pervall, if you could just

1689
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,960
find an apartment, you know, a lot of big cities.

1690
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,240
What wasn't in the case?

1691
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,720
Apartments, the living in the ranch, where it will scare us.

1692
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,880
So it took me a few days after when I arrived,

1693
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,600
I'd say no tell or someplace, for a few days

1694
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,600
and I'd like to find an apartment in a bus.

1695
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,760
Quite far, actually, far from the university.

1696
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,400
Interesting learning experience.

1697
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,920
Well, sort of the continuing topic of cultural shifts

1698
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,880
finished up in 1971 in Chicago and went to Alabama.

1699
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,080
Tell me about that.

1700
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,520
Well, I thought I wanted to be a teaching profession.

1701
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,160
And a friend of mine, former graduate of student

1702
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,880
graduated, went to the University of Alabama

1703
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,480
and got a pretty good grant to get his research set up.

1704
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,920
And so they recruited me as well to come down

1705
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,200
and get a research project started at Vanderbilt with them

1706
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,240
and also with a couple of companies.

1707
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,240
And decided I was going to be with Santa and Doyle,

1708
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,520
or I was called Essos or something, and those days out

1709
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,840
in New Jersey.

1710
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,920
They offered me a job as well, but it had been an area

1711
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,520
in New Jersey, I didn't think much of.

1712
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,440
Besides, I wanted to give teaching a go.

1713
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,760
So I took a job as an assistant professor at the University of Alabama.

1714
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,960
So we lived in Tuscosse, Alabama for 1970 to the 78 years,

1715
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,440
I guess, it was.

1716
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,440
And then I went on sabbatical leave at the Bureau of Standards

1717
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,360
that was called that in Maryland.

1718
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,360
And then they offered me a job.

1719
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,040
And I decided that the National Bureau of Standards

1720
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,800
was, in the back teaching.

1721
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,200
Because the research opportunities were far better.

1722
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,880
Because it was a struggle.

1723
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,960
Alabama is a good school, it's like in the other state school.

1724
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,640
But in those states, it was hard to raise money.

1725
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,080
And we fought a difficult to raise money

1726
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,440
from the foundations and so forth.

1727
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,880
And now, Obama, to get our research started.

1728
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,080
We raised some, we were fairly successful.

1729
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:58,080
Let's turn to my end of Jason, and I was very, very, very difficult.

1730
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,320
He spent a lot of time just trying to raise money

1731
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,480
and then so on.

1732
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,600
And also the teaching mode was fairly heavy, compared to most universities.

1733
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,280
It was two courses.

1734
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,520
You had to have six contact hours a quarter.

1735
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,600
And that didn't leave a lot of time for your research.

1736
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,720
You just had to be in there all hours of the day and night.

1737
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,200
So it was not the best research environment.

1738
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,160
It was at the University of Chicago, I was like,

1739
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,200
I just student professors taught one course, two out of the three

1740
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,280
quarters, one quarter they taught, nothing.

1741
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,480
I mean, they didn't have any teaching obligations.

1742
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,960
So I mean, there's a big difference between the research universities

1743
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,760
in your average state university.

1744
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,680
I might just still have way of more state universities

1745
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,800
that professors will have at least two courses.

1746
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,880
And that's very time-consuming.

1747
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,040
And so the bureau standards was not sabbatical leave.

1748
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,840
Of course, there's no teaching and they were fairly well funded,

1749
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,280
compared to what was at the Alabama.

1750
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,840
And it was funded directly by the government for government programs.

1751
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,400
And so eventually I had gotten a position

1752
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
where I could raise a lot of money, you know,

1753
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,200
because the NBS even in the government organization,

1754
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,680
we did do work for other government agencies.

1755
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,640
And so we did had programs that in NASA and NOAA,

1756
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,320
the Department of Defense supported.

1757
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,760
So I raised a lot, we raised a lot of money from those agencies

1758
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,960
before, you know, well-defined programs,

1759
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,000
rather than trying some fundamental research program

1760
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,880
like at National Science Foundation.

1761
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,520
So it was a very different environment.

1762
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,520
And I actually sort of liked a lot better.

1763
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,480
So it was the project, the research topic in Alabama,

1764
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,480
was that maybe it mostly makes the extension

1765
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,680
of what you had been doing in Chicago?

1766
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,360
Yeah, so I built a smaller version of what we had in Chicago

1767
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,520
and we were going to do some work on rare earths.

1768
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,000
We've got started on that.

1769
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,120
And then they'll small organic molecules.

1770
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,800
And I did just gotten that project started

1771
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,000
when I went on sabbatical leave.

1772
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,800
And originally, I went on sabbatical leave.

1773
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,440
It was a, some of you gave it a donation.

1774
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,680
Or some money came up somehow.

1775
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,840
They were going to totally run away

1776
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,880
to physics building.

1777
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,000
Everybody's going to have to move out.

1778
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,400
All of us are going to be closed down.

1779
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,840
So I said, well, we're other than just sitting here for a year.

1780
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,680
I had an offer, had had an offer to go to Maryland

1781
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,760
to the National Bureau of Standards to work with a team there.

1782
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,080
And the same kind of work photo ionization studies.

1783
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,760
And so I said, well, let's take this back leave.

1784
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,280
So I went to work for them.

1785
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,360
Just as an olisabeth leave at the Bureau of Standards.

1786
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,040
And then that first year, I still be a pay by Alabama.

1787
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,400
And the National Bureau of Standards

1788
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,920
sent them some money to pay for my time.

1789
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,360
It's called inner governmental personal act of pointy.

1790
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,240
And so I spent the first year there.

1791
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,720
Then I was going to go back.

1792
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,880
We were going to go back to Alabama.

1793
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,560
Because we liked it.

1794
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,320
They were going to have nice houses.

1795
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,160
We'd build a nice house and so forth.

1796
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,000
But they didn't get done with the renovation.

1797
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,400
They've got gone.

1798
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,560
So they're going to be out of second year.

1799
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,960
So they had asked me if I would like to stay second year

1800
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,720
at the Bureau of Standards.

1801
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,440
I said, OK, so it worked out good.

1802
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,000
Then sometimes during the second year, early in the second year,

1803
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,520
they offered me a staff position at the Bureau of Standards,

1804
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,280
which was actually doubled my salary.

1805
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,840
And then we were in Glen Baldwin and a research program.

1806
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,360
I really liked and really had high international profile.

1807
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,080
And worked with a buttery, some really top people.

1808
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,200
And it was all research.

1809
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,120
And there was no teaching.

1810
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,120
And no committees.

1811
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,000
And none of this, a lot of fundraising in those days.

1812
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,360
So it was a real opportunity I thought.

1813
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,600
And so I elected to stay at the Bureau of Standards.

1814
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,800
And so we just never went back to Alabama.

1815
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,920
But that was nothing tension, or we first went to the Gators

1816
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,400
for Maryland, for the Bureau of Standards, and it was located.

1817
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,120
What was your impression of the South when you were there?

1818
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,560
I was like good, it was that the weather's awful.

1819
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,200
I never got used to it.

1820
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,160
You know, the starts in May, the hot humidity and it would be in the 90s.

1821
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,240
And you would, you know, by human, I mean, 90 percent humidity.

1822
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,000
Not people here get off sight if it's 40 percent humidity.

1823
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,160
But I mean, it would be very, very humid.

1824
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,480
And it's hard to get used to.

1825
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,800
I never really did.

1826
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,320
It was everything in your house, your carvings, air conditioning.

1827
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,200
You'd turn that air conditioning on and wait,

1828
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,960
mainly like I say, or sometimes something by June,

1829
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,840
and it would just be on until October.

1830
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
I mean, it was, to me, it was very,

1831
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,280
but now the natives, people growing up in that,

1832
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,480
they don't seem to, they don't seem to bother,

1833
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,640
but they have become accustomed to a bite.

1834
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,440
I never really climbed the ties to that hot humidity.

1835
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,920
So that's the only thing I do like about the people more nice.

1836
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,640
The Tesla is a loving little town.

1837
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,080
It's no say it was a smaller town bigger than Corvallas,

1838
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,800
but it was still a college town, basically.

1839
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,080
And of course now, it's a subsequently, a lot bigger.

1840
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,400
They put a car factory Mercedes in one of those companies,

1841
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,120
put a assembly plant there and an Alabama.

1842
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:51,960
That's not far away.

1843
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,760
And so it's a lot of industrialization.

1844
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,120
So it's a change in Barb, just like a lot of college

1845
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,520
sometimes.

1846
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,800
How about the culture of the area?

1847
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,960
It was very different.

1848
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,760
I mean, you know, you normally think of a South

1849
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,480
as being real racist.

1850
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,760
Well, they had their, their little vestiges of segregation,

1851
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,560
but it was, to me, was less harsh in those terms.

1852
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,000
And what I used to see in Chicago was really ugly.

1853
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,240
I mind, in fact, the first department I ran at the guy

1854
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,920
says, I'll give you real, real good deal

1855
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,080
because I want a white guy live in here.

1856
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,780
Well, I think I didn't, I had no idea what the customer

1857
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,560
wanted to know about, I'll take the deal

1858
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,680
because I didn't need to replace the state.

1859
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,200
This was good, I hadn't arranged it at housing.

1860
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,120
But they were, they were, there were different racism

1861
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,080
that you could have served in there.

1862
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,560
You'd see some of that in Alabama,

1863
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,200
but not to the extent, the reason that seemed more harmonious

1864
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,000
to me than the racial relations in Chicago.

1865
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,640
That's the blacks and the whites in the South.

1866
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,720
Now that other people probably have a different perspective,

1867
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,120
I know, but I mean, I didn't see the harshness

1868
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,520
that I would, and they'll work to things

1869
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,520
that you press that I saw in Chicago.

1870
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,080
That's just one man's take on the other people,

1871
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,000
but I think that would probably be a different take on it.

1872
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,960
Well, one thing I'm sure that was indescapable,

1873
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,680
while you were there was, was called football.

1874
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,520
Oh, yeah.

1875
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,160
Yeah, one, three national championships

1876
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,760
during your time at Barbrain is the coach.

1877
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,960
Yeah, they take football real seriously in the South.

1878
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,400
I mean, the average were going,

1879
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,040
I mean, they just live and die.

1880
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,320
And then, you know, place like Texas, too.

1881
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,200
I mean, just in Mississippi,

1882
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,240
the Louisiana, all of them, it is the sport.

1883
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,520
And they really take it seriously.

1884
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,520
And Alabama has this constant feud with Auburn,

1885
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,560
which is sort of, Auburn sort of the quote

1886
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,080
of work in the state is, it's a land practice rule.

1887
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,920
I think, it's Auburn, because it's in the city of Auburn.

1888
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,440
But there's a fierce rivalry.

1889
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,680
And it's been going off for years and years,

1890
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,560
and they, and it comes apart a couple.

1891
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,520
So even people who don't go to the schools,

1892
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,200
they're an Auburn and Alabama fan,

1893
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,640
and, you know, where they can be a mill worker, whatever, you know,

1894
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,440
and they'll have their loves, these sort of unknowingly.

1895
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,200
I see some of that in Oregon, but it's not, it's not,

1896
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,680
it's like, it's just, it's pro-nails.

1897
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,440
But they do take football seriously.

1898
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,560
And Barbrain was a really revered person.

1899
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:30,760
I mean, they have a lot of club.

1900
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,040
I think.

1901
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,040
For sure.

1902
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,840
Well, you mentioned it's sabbatical and you started

1903
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,960
up full-time at the National Bureau of Standards in 1980.

1904
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,920
So I guess you can tell me a little bit about moving

1905
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,480
to the DC area and settling in, and then your first position

1906
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,320
in the physicist and the radiation physics division.

1907
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,160
Yeah, I was, I liked it.

1908
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,600
I liked it.

1909
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,440
The climate marons a little bit.

1910
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,400
You get, you call winners in marons.

1911
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,600
You get more diversity.

1912
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,560
It's Alabama.

1913
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,320
It's hot most of the time, even all you around.

1914
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,040
But the marons, it's, it's you wouldn't hot

1915
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,640
on the summer time, which cools down the fall on the winter,

1916
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,280
you get snow and so on.

1917
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,200
So we first year, we lived in an apartment,

1918
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,080
and maybe my wife and my kids were like that.

1919
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,960
So we bought a house.

1920
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,000
I probably has offered a job and bought a house

1921
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,120
and lived in the same place for 1980 on.

1922
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,120
And so I, I kind of tried to like it as a,

1923
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,440
Washington DC area is a culture of a diverse

1924
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,040
and very, very interesting region.

1925
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,440
And it's, some war battle fields, you know,

1926
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,040
in Gettysburg and Teetham will run all those

1927
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:41,280
or hours so drive away from where we lived in Gettysburg.

1928
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,160
And those are all very interesting.

1929
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,960
And well done by the National Park Service

1930
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,560
in terms of historical presentations.

1931
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,680
So I really enjoyed that.

1932
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,480
We enjoyed the museums downtown, the Smithsonian Museum,

1933
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,920
so it just, it's simply the best there is.

1934
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,200
And that's all free.

1935
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,600
And, you know, from where we were 30 minutes away,

1936
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,240
and I'll take the train down the other foot of subway

1937
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,840
system, and we would close the terminals of the subway lines

1938
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,320
with it, it used to be in the end down if you wanted.

1939
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,160
So the cultural, cultural things are immense,

1940
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,720
and we would get the season tickets to the,

1941
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,560
to some orchestra arrangements at the Kennedy Center.

1942
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,320
And that was always great.

1943
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,840
Crowd would be great.

1944
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,240
I mean, it's a traffic soft, downtown Washington.

1945
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,480
But it was a nice place to live.

1946
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,640
I enjoyed the experience of great deal.

1947
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,440
And, you know, there were so, the negative sides

1948
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,920
is the weather, and it's also very, very crowded.

1949
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,720
The roads to Washington, Bellway, and it's truly awful.

1950
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,240
And the roadway, we were not too far from the interstate 270,

1951
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,720
which runs out of north of northwest to out of Washington,

1952
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,520
and it's a, it's an emissary busy road

1953
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,920
because all the commuter traffic back for the DC,

1954
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,080
and from the Maryland suburbs at the work downtown,

1955
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,360
and it, it's 14 lanes in places.

1956
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,440
It's seven lanes each way with the feeder.

1957
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,640
It's just awful.

1958
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,760
And you get on out of the boat for the bumper,

1959
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,800
all those lanes, and rush out.

1960
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,480
If you, off rush out, it's busy.

1961
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,480
We would just, sometimes, listen,

1962
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,800
we bought a boat that we kept over on the Chesapeake,

1963
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,880
and even on Saturday morning, getting over to the Chesapeake,

1964
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,880
which is anapolis, near anapolis, was to have been an easy hour,

1965
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,640
hour and a half drive, sometimes we've lost a lot longer

1966
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,480
because we're just traffic on Saturday morning.

1967
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,240
So it's a very, very crowded.

1968
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,880
That's one of the reasons when we retired,

1969
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,720
we were not going to live in the DC suburbs,

1970
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,720
and we ended up out here in Stead,

1971
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,200
and I think it was an incision.

1972
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,600
We both were really glad we made, mainly the living conditions.

1973
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,160
And the coast like here is the, you know,

1974
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,680
and things in the DC suburbs are really superb,

1975
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,280
but the crowded in Stead and the weather

1976
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,120
are really contrary to my particular life.

1977
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,680
So some people, I can of course, you know,

1978
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,520
that's not what I like.

1979
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,360
So we enjoy the weather and the environment here much better.

1980
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,720
We'll tell you about the prevention of your working.

1981
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,040
I was first hired at,

1982
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,760
when I was post-docing,

1983
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,920
I was very, not really post-docing though.

1984
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,000
I was working as a guest scientist there,

1985
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
a first year of our civil professor at Alabama.

1986
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,320
I worked in a laboratory with a guy named Henry Rosenstock

1987
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,160
and Roger Stockbauer.

1988
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,000
We were very well-known in chemical physics

1989
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,600
for doing internal structures of molecules.

1990
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,240
So the energetic some molecules.

1991
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:45,160
So we worked with some techniques using

1992
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,680
of professional photo-1, electro-inspectroscopy,

1993
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,000
studying molecular processes and small molecules.

1994
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Then at that first year also they were getting started

1995
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,400
on the synchrotrophysic,

1996
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,520
and it's the nest,

1997
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,520
and the NBS has a small electron synchrotron,

1998
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,600
which generates light,

1999
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,080
a total of all light.

2000
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,160
They were getting a project started using

2001
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,040
synchrotron radiation for photo-electrons

2002
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,200
by trustees.

2003
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,840
So I joined on with Roger Stockbauer

2004
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,680
and a team from Argon, Joe Deamer and his team at Argon

2005
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,800
National Laboratory.

2006
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,760
Bill Electrons by Tromber System that was able

2007
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,960
to angely resolve the electrons coming off

2008
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,920
from an ionization process and atoms

2009
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,680
with many small molecules.

2010
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,280
So we built that system for a year, I was there,

2011
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,600
and then there was another reason for me

2012
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,400
to stay a second year and then basically take a job

2013
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,240
because that apparatus was just coming into fruition

2014
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,080
in terms of the spot activity.

2015
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,760
So we were able to do some really, really, really interesting things

2016
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,400
and new kinds of studies using synchrotron radiation

2017
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,080
and the electrons by Tromber are doing angle-resolved

2018
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,840
photo-electronization studies.

2019
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,680
So some of the first of that type in the world,

2020
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:04,920
and it was very well received on this community.

2021
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,440
So we did that and then build a successfully

2022
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,960
build new instruments in terms of four electrons

2023
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,440
with trust to be in an angle-resolved

2024
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,720
and participated in illustrative space

2025
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,280
and a few other kinds of experience experiments.

2026
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,560
And so the laboratory experiments that I first

2027
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,200
got started going with there, we quit all that all together

2028
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,000
and collected lives and closed down to make

2029
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
all the photo-electronization out of work

2030
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,360
that was done with the synchrotron.

2031
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,800
And that's where I was hired as when they offered me

2032
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,760
the staff position was to work on the team of scientists

2033
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,640
working on the call of psychotron ultraviolet radiation facility

2034
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,680
at the NPS and in 1980, you're 80,

2035
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,360
you want to change the name from NPS to NIST.

2036
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,680
So it's the same organization with these Congress

2037
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,560
in there, infinite wisdom decided to change the name.

2038
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,240
Reflected a little different mission, I guess,

2039
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,960
was the idea, like changing orders to take college

2040
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,360
ordering to state university.

2041
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,240
That's sort of the thing in that.

2042
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,440
Nothing fundamentally changed,

2043
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,280
it's just, after we do all the letterhead and door signs.

2044
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,280
But it's so I worked in that operation for about five years,

2045
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,920
as a research physicist in the radiation physics division,

2046
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,000
and with the part of our physics group

2047
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
under the guineamed Robert Matton,

2048
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,120
who was in charge of the synchrotron,

2049
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,600
and a very well-known optical person,

2050
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,240
the monocholar design, so forth.

2051
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:40,240
So it was a wonderful experience working with the scientists there.

2052
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,480
And the other nice thing about NIST,

2053
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,520
I'll call it that, that's his name now,

2054
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,320
is that it's in Washington DC area.

2055
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,760
So you get a continued tour touring of a really well-known

2056
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,720
scientist from throughout the world.

2057
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,920
This is one thing I missed in Alabama.

2058
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,160
You have to really work out to get to Tusklyce,

2059
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,520
but everybody comes through Washington DC

2060
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,960
and they would visit NIST in those days.

2061
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,600
And we also collaborated with a team of scientists

2062
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,560
on these photo-wechron works from England,

2063
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,000
and John West from Darsbury,

2064
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,600
laboratory in England, Keith Kotlin,

2065
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,400
from Redding University in England.

2066
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,680
Another people in our programs,

2067
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,880
and in fact, I would then go to England

2068
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,120
and work on the six trophies,

2069
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,760
so the Darsbury and the United Kingdom and the later stages,

2070
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,520
we transferred it over the instrumentation that we built it.

2071
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,720
NIST, new photo-wechron, so across the country,

2072
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,560
we transported it to England.

2073
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,400
This was a big piece of equipment, many tons,

2074
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,720
and it transferred it to the Darsbury laboratory

2075
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,040
and near up near Manchester,

2076
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,680
Darsbury is a small town.

2077
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,760
And then the slide would perform,

2078
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,160
we'd do some work over there as well,

2079
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,200
with my English colleagues.

2080
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,520
So it was a real nice collaboration between

2081
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,520
the Darsbury and the Darsbury laboratory.

2082
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,520
So of course, I made good friends who we still have to this day

2083
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,520
with the English colleague, got defensive time,

2084
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
and in other central facilities,

2085
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,520
in France and other places as well, to visit.

2086
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,520
It was a very, very rewarding time-scientific,

2087
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,520
and a lot of travel and interesting people.

2088
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,520
That was one of the nice things I really enjoyed about NIST,

2089
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,520
was the depth of the world.

2090
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,520
NIST was the depth of the people we've worked with,

2091
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,520
and so the best people from all over the world.

2092
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,520
We had guests from France, China,

2093
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Japan, all over, and to come to work on our laboratories,

2094
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,520
and that was a extremely rewarding scientific time.

2095
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,520
And so I worked on those six-chron-ray-shakes

2096
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,520
where I must have told the mid-1980s,

2097
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,520
85, or 86, something like that.

2098
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,520
And I was offered a job in another division,

2099
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,520
as a group leader,

2100
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,520
there was a division that was having some personal problems,

2101
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,520
and had a lot of difficulties.

2102
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,520
As I said, take over a group that needed some attention,

2103
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,520
and then they'd call it a specter-ready-art review,

2104
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,520
I guess it was the name of it.

2105
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,520
So it became a group leader, which is the most level main

2106
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,520
position of the NIST.

2107
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,520
And I think about 1986, something like that, I don't know.

2108
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,520
And I worked on that division.

2109
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,520
It was called the Radiometric Physics Division,

2110
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:34,520
and it was, it's job was to do all the optical measurements,

2111
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,520
or most of the optical measurements for this country.

2112
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,520
It's standards.

2113
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,520
They did everything from standard light bulbs.

2114
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
You know, when you buy light bulbs,

2115
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,520
the store will have a loom and rating on it,

2116
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,520
so we maintain those standards in the standard of the candellas,

2117
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,520
as well as optical temperature measurements.

2118
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,520
So we developed that division, as well as maintain all those standards,

2119
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:59,520
as well as to develop the technology to improve the standards.

2120
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,520
So we worked a lot with the industry,

2121
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,520
to collaborate with industrial partners,

2122
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,520
to develop better measurement techniques to help

2123
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,520
product quality and reliability on the assembly.

2124
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,520
It comes like code act, 3M,

2125
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,520
that do have a lot of optical measurement problems.

2126
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,520
For example, 3M makes a lot of white paper.

2127
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,520
I think that makes sure you need reflective standards,

2128
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,520
and how you measure all that.

2129
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,520
And so on and I spent time with helping code act,

2130
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,520
to collaborate measuring processes and optical processes

2131
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,520
for properly making your measuring film.

2132
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
They had a lot of instruments.

2133
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,520
And in those days, those are the film days.

2134
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
The old technologies changed.

2135
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
But then on LEDs,

2136
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,520
and other kinds of sources, light sources that became available,

2137
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,520
we had to develop the technology to properly characterize those.

2138
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,520
And I imagine, because they were a little different,

2139
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,520
little different needs in your index and bulbs and fluorescent bulbs.

2140
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,520
And so our division, the work with industry,

2141
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:01,520
to develop the right strategy to making a reliable and consistent measurement.

2142
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,520
It became industry standards,

2143
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,520
and how you measure an LED's property and so on.

2144
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,520
And so that's the job that division.

2145
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,520
I eventually became the division chief of that division.

2146
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,520
I remember when that was in that late-eatory night,

2147
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,520
and that's when I retired in 2007.

2148
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,520
It was a chief of the changes to the name

2149
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,520
and the optical technology division.

2150
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
Since I've less than subsequently changed this name again,

2151
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
there have been another reorganization.

2152
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,520
But it's basically the same division.

2153
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,520
It's now called sensor science division or something of that nature.

2154
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,520
So I was able to then be in charge of all these measurement techniques

2155
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,520
and develop, develop work for early-covered agencies.

2156
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
And that was very rewarding.

2157
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
I enjoyed that.

2158
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,520
We had projects back in the mid-80s.

2159
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,520
The effect was on my first job as a group leader in specter radiometry.

2160
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,520
The defense department was having problems characterizing

2161
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,520
very low-level infrared sensors that are used for satellite purposes.

2162
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10,520
And that's a security program.

2163
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:16,520
And they had to be sensors that were calibrated at very, very low temperatures.

2164
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,520
Because they were sensors that would look at the background

2165
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,520
and space looking at a missile threat.

2166
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,520
That sort of thing.

2167
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,520
And so they would operate really well in terms of that.

2168
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,520
And we calibrated and they made a measurement assurance.

2169
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,520
They were seeing what they told you they were seeing.

2170
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,520
And we developed techniques to calibrate things that five degrees

2171
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,520
of colour and just a little bit of absolute zero.

2172
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,520
Very little temperatures.

2173
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,520
And called low background infrared calibrational cell.

2174
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,520
So it's that was a real challenge technically.

2175
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,520
And that's facility cell.

2176
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:50,520
And in a place being used to characterize very low level background

2177
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,520
sort of signals.

2178
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,520
And sensor systems for primarily duty.

2179
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,520
But occasionally NASA and other government agencies have

2180
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,520
needs for characterizing very low background sources.

2181
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,520
Things are going to operate in space primarily.

2182
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,520
So that was a fun project.

2183
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,520
And development of technology and capabilities for the department of defense.

2184
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,520
So they of course would pay for it.

2185
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,520
Department of Defense and pay painless for it.

2186
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,520
We're doing this work.

2187
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,520
And so we risked a lot of projects for NOAA.

2188
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,520
And NASA for the support.

2189
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,520
It's a weird optical division.

2190
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,520
Supporting satellite technology.

2191
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,520
You see these pictures of the colour pictures of the earth.

2192
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,520
You see pictures of the oceans.

2193
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,520
Whether they're using cameras on spacecraft to measure ocean properties.

2194
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,520
All those cameras and devices have to be calibrated.

2195
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,520
They're specterary, yonder system basically flying around the space.

2196
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,520
Looking at the spectral content of light coming back from the earth.

2197
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,520
The earth from the surface reflected.

2198
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,520
And that tells you about the properties of the vegetation on the case of the oceans.

2199
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,520
The plank and then the carbon content of the ocean.

2200
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:03,520
So we work with NASA to develop calibration strategies to calibrate the satellites.

2201
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,520
And then involves building calibration systems for the satellites before they are launched.

2202
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,520
And then trying to build systems so they can verify their operation while in flight.

2203
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,520
And that tells, for example, the satellite's looking at standard sources.

2204
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,520
In fact, there's a, we have one of the big projects was to have a,

2205
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
it was a buoy system out there.

2206
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:30,520
And Lenin and Hawaiian Islands that measures the light coming out of the ocean.

2207
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,520
They call it the upwelling radius of the ocean.

2208
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
So it's reflected light from the sun.

2209
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,520
Going back up.

2210
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,520
And that's what the spacecraft will see.

2211
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,520
You see, you'll see the light coming off the ocean.

2212
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
So that's measured out in Hawaii.

2213
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,520
So the spacecraft will have a,

2214
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,520
and it'll fly over and give them the same old changes in the measurement.

2215
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,520
We can tell what it is that the Earth's surface of the water surface, if you will.

2216
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,520
And the satellite then can check its calibration.

2217
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,520
And that's been a mind-blowing project.

2218
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,520
In fact, I'm still consulting someone that particular project.

2219
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Well, we have one of the projects to develop the other projects development.

2220
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,520
Calibration, precision, and measurement procedures.

2221
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,520
A whole range of sensor systems for the, for the,

2222
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,520
the no-one NASA project because it was an interesting department.

2223
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,520
Another, another agencies that, that have a secure program.

2224
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,520
So they have to be a very sophisticated sensor systems.

2225
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,520
We work with them on that as well.

2226
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,520
Let's see, I, or whatever, you know, they, they have a sensor program.

2227
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,520
So we were a government agency that would help work with them to,

2228
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,520
to develop their sensor measurement capabilities.

2229
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,520
Well, as I've listened to you described,

2230
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,520
they said a couple of things occur to me in everyone.

2231
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,520
It sounds like it's a pretty big shift when you, when you switch gears to,

2232
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
to the radiation physics division.

2233
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
Or to the, sorry, the great, the spectral radio,

2234
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
oh, I'm a spectrary elementary group.

2235
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,520
If I'm doing sort of this more fundamental research,

2236
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,520
you're dealing with for it to this thing.

2237
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,520
I was a big shift from a fundamental research to a applied research.

2238
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,520
But the underlying, the theme was, it was all light measuring.

2239
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,520
And, and manipulation controlling light.

2240
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,520
And it's a, you're using light as a source.

2241
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,520
So you have to build monochrombers and build detectors of radiological radiation,

2242
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,520
and so on.

2243
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,520
So, and then in radiometry, the concentration is not on the use of the light,

2244
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,520
but of measuring the light and characterizing, you see.

2245
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,520
In characterizing the sensors so that someone else can,

2246
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,520
you know, quickly determine what they're, what they're measuring.

2247
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,520
And in the case of the satellites,

2248
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,520
what they'll want to know is what the, what the,

2249
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,520
the radiation is at one way that compared to another.

2250
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,520
And, and the one and all that pretty accurately,

2251
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,520
so that those ratios, those wavelengths will tell you,

2252
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,520
for example, the plank of concentration.

2253
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,520
And so, it's, it's all optics of some sort of,

2254
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,520
or dealing with like a magnetic radiation,

2255
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
but it's, it's a different emphasis.

2256
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,520
And you actually write the,

2257
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
reometry division was a,

2258
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,520
a very applied on the measurement and the measurement technology.

2259
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,520
And development is sources as well as the,

2260
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,520
you know,

2261
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,520
you characterization of these things.

2262
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
Where's the,

2263
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,520
the second generation, which was,

2264
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,520
it was the fundamental driver was trying to understand

2265
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,520
some basic features of atomic and lighter of physics.

2266
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,520
You know, how molecules are nice and dissociate somewhat.

2267
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,520
Yeah.

2268
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,520
It's also the application of science,

2269
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,520
to a very wide variety of projects,

2270
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,520
several which apparently involve some national security implications

2271
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,520
that must develop the tremendous fun area.

2272
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,520
Yeah, it is.

2273
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,520
And very diverse, I mean,

2274
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,520
and we had colleagues,

2275
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,520
our labs and boulders, there was a whole group of divisions

2276
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,520
that was just concentrated on developing techniques for measuring laser

2277
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,520
and laser power.

2278
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,520
And that, you know, we played with them too.

2279
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
It was fascinating.

2280
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,520
And so it was a, it was a real learning experience.

2281
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,520
And it was also a lot of fun.

2282
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,520
And you know, the highest level is either the best people doing this,

2283
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,520
anywhere.

2284
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,520
Mike, our organization had, you know,

2285
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,520
in terms of the national labs.

2286
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,520
It was probably, you know,

2287
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,520
one of the premier national labs in the world

2288
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,520
in terms of the quality of its research and

2289
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,520
calibration and development.

2290
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,520
So it was a real, you know, really a lot of fun

2291
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,520
and it was a very rewarding and intellectually.

2292
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
And again, it's the people.

2293
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
I mean, it's really the best for these were the best people

2294
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
and these fields are anywhere.

2295
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,520
So it was a very enjoyable time.

2296
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,520
It's a job that I hope everybody can get.

2297
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,520
I mean, a job in the sense that you go to work

2298
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,520
and you really love it.

2299
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,520
And you, you don't try to avoid working on it.

2300
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,520
It's, it's fun to be there.

2301
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,520
I really feel fortunate in that regard.

2302
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,520
I've got myself in a career where work was really fun.

2303
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,520
It was financially rewarding.

2304
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,520
And but it was, it was enjoyable to do.

2305
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,520
And not, some people I under you talked to there.

2306
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,520
They were always discriminable about the working.

2307
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,520
I would never say that I truly enjoyed my career for everything.

2308
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
Grad school at Oregon State.

2309
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,520
I enjoyed being a student.

2310
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,520
I enjoyed graduate school.

2311
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,520
I enjoyed being the national team of state and technology as well.

2312
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,520
Yeah.

2313
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,520
Good answer anymore with that.

2314
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,520
Yeah.

2315
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:02,520
What was your family up to during the DC era at DC years?

2316
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,520
You're wife and children?

2317
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,520
My wife worked at several occupations.

2318
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,520
She ran daycare at home for a while.

2319
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,520
But then she went back to school to hop and John Hopkins,

2320
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,520
and got her master's degree in counseling.

2321
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:27,520
And then working in the school systems are in Montgomery County for many years as a middle school counselor and so on.

2322
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,520
So she was able to retire from that one.

2323
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
She was a school counselor.

2324
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:38,520
My kids went both on the college in Maryland and they enjoyed that.

2325
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,520
In fact, my son was still out in there.

2326
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,520
And there he was and he said he had to college.

2327
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,520
He wanted to be a cop.

2328
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,520
He's with the Fairfax County police.

2329
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,520
It's just across the river from Washington, D.C.

2330
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,520
And he enjoys that a great deal.

2331
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,520
My daughter is a nurse that she lives out here in Oregon City,

2332
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,520
and works for Kaiser in the Portland area.

2333
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,520
Well, I'm going to switch gears a little bit and ask you about books and book collecting.

2334
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,520
That's how we first became acquainted with one another.

2335
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,520
And I'm interested in knowing what kind of that started.

2336
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
How did you get into collecting books?

2337
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
I still have my books from high school.

2338
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,520
Nice, a lot of them.

2339
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,520
And probably a good portion of my books from Oregon State to some of them.

2340
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:29,520
And so I always just like books and collected books in graduate school.

2341
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,520
I always like to read.

2342
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,520
And then many of whom we moved to Washington.

2343
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,520
And as a Maryland act, I should say, in a D.C. suburb.

2344
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,520
I got interested in older books, rare books.

2345
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,520
The friend mind was also interested.

2346
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:49,520
And so we sort of got involved in that together back in the 80s.

2347
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:58,520
And got sort of collecting significant volumes back in the late 80s, I think.

2348
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:03,520
And then got interested in the history of printing was fascinating.

2349
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,520
And how that affected our culture.

2350
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:15,520
And my mind that the ability to print disseminating information really had a profound effect on our culture.

2351
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,520
We don't know our religion.

2352
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,520
But education, the change, the change that we live in, they think.

2353
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:30,520
And then allowed everybody, if it can learn to read, to have access to information.

2354
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:36,520
And led to things like the reformation and the root cultural changes.

2355
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:40,520
And then not to speak about how to affect your education.

2356
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,520
If you think about it before the print in the book.

2357
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Getting in the book was very, very difficult.

2358
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,520
Getting knowledge was very, very definitely.

2359
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,520
That you had someone had read something.

2360
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:57,520
But to get a copy of a scholarly work prior to the printing press.

2361
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,520
You had to be wealthy enough to hire somebody to do it by hand.

2362
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:09,520
So the average person, even the professional person probably wouldn't have any volumes back prior to the printing press.

2363
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,520
But the print press was in my mind.

2364
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,520
It was a great liberating thing for changing culture.

2365
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
I just sort of interested in that.

2366
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,520
Got interested in the technology of printing.

2367
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,520
And then of course, some of the knowledge are just beautiful.

2368
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,520
And they want to look at it and how they were.

2369
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
And how they preserve it.

2370
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,520
I always found that fascinating too.

2371
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,520
You can buy a book that's 500 years old and open it up.

2372
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,520
And it probably looks as, you know, some of them look as good as the day they were.

2373
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,520
They were printed.

2374
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,520
Like one of the books that the library has is a 50-0-3 Seneca.

2375
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,520
It's in Latin.

2376
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,520
But it's of Seneca's works.

2377
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,520
And that paper is as fresh as the day it was made.

2378
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
There's no fox in a lot of books in the paper.

2379
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,520
A lot of foxes in the paper.

2380
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,520
It's just a change in the culture of the paper.

2381
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,520
But the last forever seems like.

2382
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,520
So it's a fascinating technology.

2383
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:09,520
But just keeping in mind the profound impact that had upon our civilization.

2384
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,520
And then how we write it all we are now.

2385
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:18,520
Now, it's comparable change in the last couple decades of how this electronic environment

2386
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,520
electronic delivered information is going to affect culture.

2387
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,520
It remains to be seen.

2388
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,520
How they integrate into this educational process.

2389
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,520
And in our general cultural behavior.

2390
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,520
So it'll be an interesting thing.

2391
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,520
I probably won't live long enough to see the outcome of the orbital.

2392
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,520
It's a profound change.

2393
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:42,520
And how people can get information and how you deliver information.

2394
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,520
And so things will solve you all.

2395
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,520
As they certainly did in the late 15th century when the printing press became available.

2396
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,520
And now education never has changed.

2397
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,520
So it will be a profound thing.

2398
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,520
Tell me a bit about your methods for collecting that scouting out and purchasing in.

2399
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,520
I've got a topic of a thing.

2400
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,520
If I could get various science things, that's a message.

2401
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,520
I always would get that.

2402
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,520
If it were something I could afford.

2403
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,520
And then it primarily was in history.

2404
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,520
I was always at some interest in history.

2405
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,520
And in history of printing.

2406
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,520
So I have some of the volumes.

2407
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:27,520
I have about purely because they were from a given printer and town,

2408
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,520
like being us or whatever, from maybe the 16th century.

2409
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,520
But it would be representative of that kind of printing and that that era.

2410
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,520
So some of the books of that.

2411
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,520
And then there's a wall on scholarly works too.

2412
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,520
Like the Seneca.

2413
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,520
I mentioned earlier.

2414
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,520
And then there's another nice file.

2415
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,520
I gave you the Strabo geography, which is a really early production of.

2416
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,520
Strabo was a Roman.

2417
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,520
Jog first.

2418
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,520
Commentaries and maps of the ancient world.

2419
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,520
That book is complete with all the diagram maps and diagrams and so forth.

2420
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,520
And so it's fascinating to.

2421
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,520
If then it's in both Greek and Latin.

2422
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,520
And it's fascinating just to look at that and see the.

2423
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,520
The the Romans concept of the world was.

2424
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,520
I mean the math and the math actually fairly accurate with the.

2425
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,520
The curvature.

2426
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,520
There's totally displayed and so on and so forth.

2427
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,520
So the.

2428
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,520
It tells you just shows you just quite graphically how.

2429
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,520
How well how much the each is really new about the world.

2430
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
And they weren't as.

2431
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,520
As it's.

2432
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,520
As it's.

2433
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,520
As it's sometimes portrayed.

2434
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
So I I get a kick on then the.

2435
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
Some of the early scientific stuff.

2436
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,520
Do there's a.

2437
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,520
Copy of.

2438
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,520
It's in French have been frankles work on electricity.

2439
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
And that was published.

2440
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,520
I think with the repubition and this country was published in France when he was.

2441
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,520
We spent in time in France.

2442
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
And so as a.

2443
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:57,520
We'll insight into and to been frankles time as a frankle file.

2444
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,520
I mean serving the country in France.

2445
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
So there's.

2446
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,520
And it's a Murray Newton.

2447
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
It's just.

2448
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
It's absolutely fascinating.

2449
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,520
I think.

2450
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:08,520
There's another interesting very scientific books as well.

2451
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,520
Thank you.

2452
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,520
They're interesting.

2453
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,520
But the scholar things is some good histories.

2454
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,520
You know, and this is a good collection of.

2455
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,520
Johnson.

2456
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,520
The writer poet and that.

2457
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,520
Well, and his background for Boswell.

2458
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,520
They have a nice set of.

2459
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,520
We're really.

2460
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,520
And I certainly.

2461
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,520
Early.

2462
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,520
Productions and publications.

2463
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,520
And that's here.

2464
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,520
So that's a.

2465
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,520
Port part of the cultural history of the.

2466
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:35,520
English speaking people.

2467
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,520
Well, it's that things like that would.

2468
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,520
With track liners as well as.

2469
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,520
There's quite a few travel books of the early travel books.

2470
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,520
People would.

2471
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,520
Back in the.

2472
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
This puts things consistent, men and women.

2473
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
At the same time.

2474
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,520
hockey at the same.

2475
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,520
Back in the.

2476
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,520
Fifteen out of ruins.

2477
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,360
Fifteen in the sense in the sense of I

2478
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,020
celebrated the one family that

2479
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,520
attend to taxes at oh power, they might not see

2480
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,520
the second thing you want to see a sense of

2481
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
thing.

2482
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:19,020
I'm trying to procure those as well because it was an interesting insight into the culture

2483
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,420
and history and in that of those tight frames.

2484
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:28,340
Those kinds of things as well, I found interesting and sometimes books are in the beautiful

2485
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:32,340
I mean they're pretty beautiful and the bindings are good shape and you just say, well, I gotta

2486
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,340
have that.

2487
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:38,820
Well, I know that you've taken pride in the fact that you actually read these books

2488
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,340
to, you know, I'll just put just in it, put them on the shelf.

2489
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,340
Exactly.

2490
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:47,580
In fact, I can continue to do so even when I gave where you state the jewelry that you see

2491
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:51,580
this right over here is just collected in the last couple of years which eventually went

2492
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:57,620
up in your library but got a, for example, even in the other room I was saying on the

2493
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:04,280
Stanford office said, I got a really nice Bible that won the first complete English Bible

2494
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,280
printed in the United States.

2495
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:11,040
In fact, it's generally thought to be like 1796, the first complete Bible I was some earlier

2496
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:17,260
just new Old Testaments and Ernie Testaments published but this is a complete Bible called

2497
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:21,700
the Collins Bible I believe with the Old Testaments New Testament, all the books of the

2498
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,100
Parker for all bound in one and it's a really good shape.

2499
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:33,140
So, that's something I came across just recently in last year or so and there's a, I think

2500
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:38,500
the book of theirs is Poochard's Lies and early Poochard's Lies in English.

2501
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:46,000
So, that's one to sit down and read, Poochard was the Roman bargain for back, back in

2502
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,400
so you can want to know about Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great of these people that have

2503
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,000
early, early, early printing of a Poochard.

2504
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,500
Of course, you can buy and go down and pay the paper back now that the same thing happened.

2505
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:04,120
But here's a nice, early publication of a Poochard.

2506
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,860
We spent three decades compiling this collection and made decisions at some point donate it to your

2507
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:12,220
alma mater or every state tell me about the thought process there.

2508
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:17,620
Well, I knew, neither one of my kids is really interested in rare books per se, of course

2509
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:21,620
they'd be interested in the value of their, I mean that goes without saying, right?

2510
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:27,940
I mean, they have to be hindered mentally if they didn't want that, you know, but if you have

2511
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:32,820
a collection like that and people with collections often have this issue, as you get older,

2512
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,220
so how do I, you know, what's going to be the ultimate disposal of it, if we, my wife

2513
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:42,620
might both pass, will pass away, if the books were still sitting in the house, the children

2514
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:46,620
wouldn't know how to, you know, they don't particularly want them in their house, but what

2515
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:47,620
would they do with them?

2516
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:52,020
Well, they would call of some estate agent, right?

2517
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:57,420
And then they would sell on somebody being nearby in a $5,000 book for 50 cents, right?

2518
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,020
And so that's not too smart.

2519
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:04,020
The other option, well, well, I could start selling them myself.

2520
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:12,020
That is truly a deal of, you could do it, and you might or might not realize very much money,

2521
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:18,220
but the beauty of the donations, you can have them appraised by a good appraiser, and

2522
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:21,820
they stayed together as a collection in the case of, that's what we would have for our

2523
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,820
estate.

2524
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,420
So others will use them, so it was very satisfying when you were, and somebody tells me

2525
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:29,620
how the students were using, that was the intent.

2526
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:33,820
So we decided that rather than trying to sell them or something, I think we're going to

2527
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:38,780
Oregon State, the benefit to us is, it's a tax deduction.

2528
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:48,720
So we get to realize a tax deduction, so this is a large sum over a period of time, and

2529
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,820
help us out financially.

2530
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:54,820
So actually, probably in the end, that's probably more rewarding financially than trying

2531
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:57,060
to sell them, and all that headache.

2532
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:01,620
Plus, the main thing is, they should even get us a collection for others to use, and as

2533
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:06,260
long as I'm able, I can, the current drive down to myself, you see, so we thought it was,

2534
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:11,220
we thought about it a while, and it would be funny to decide that was part of the best

2535
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:18,060
strategy, and then Mr. Meek came up and looked them over, and then he said that the

2536
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:25,380
range was your librarian, faith, to accept the collection, and so it's worked out excellent,

2537
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,940
and it's a really satisfying, because the staff of Oregon State is just super in that

2538
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:34,940
library, and then it's been served as students there, because I was student there, and

2539
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:39,140
I don't think there was anything like that there when I was there, and if I was, I was

2540
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:46,060
not cognizant of it, so if we benefit the kids of this state or whoever, we think, that's

2541
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,060
very satisfying.

2542
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:53,700
And the main thing is that something we've spent a long time at a massing, and to have

2543
01:38:53,700 --> 01:39:00,540
just go to all of the, and try and sell it, it's, it's not, that's rewarding, it is

2544
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:07,020
financially, but that wouldn't mean that much to us. We're comfortable with you tired, and

2545
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:12,020
another few thousand older ones, at this point in our life, it's not going to be particularly

2546
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:18,060
beneficial, so it's much more satisfying to do what we did, and of course, a lot of

2547
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:23,060
Oregon State immediately, and part, because that's where I was graduated and graduated

2548
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:26,700
from, and I liked that the great deal, I have very far members of Oregon State, but also

2549
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:31,940
one of my friends, probably got me thinking about it, so it was Derek Callahan, who was

2550
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:39,860
on your, the alumni, or so she's an foundation for a while, and he didn't raise the

2551
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:43,500
issue about it, but he told me about the kind of things he did, you know, really helping

2552
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,180
the University of Race, when he was so forth, and that sort of sparked my mind, well,

2553
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:51,900
me, that's something we could do, you know, to help the University out by, so we can't

2554
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:58,260
go, Derek, put us in contact with something in the foundation, and Ryan is Ryan Robertson

2555
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:06,500
at the time, and working with he, and the light-verse staff put me and so forth, we made

2556
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,060
the arrangements, so we have found a good satisfying.

2557
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,300
Well, the last thing I want to ask you about is, is your continued connection to OSU,

2558
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:19,420
you're never the library advisory council, OSU is in the midst of a transition expansion

2559
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:23,900
right now, what is your sense of where OSU is at right now, a very different place

2560
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,540
from the one that he went to?

2561
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:30,740
It certainly is, and I think what you would pay in, the rest of you have done at the library,

2562
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:31,740
it's just phenomenal.

2563
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:36,260
I mean, the library was not at all like that when I was a student here, and trying to

2564
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:42,500
transition and to take advantage of the modern electronic tools and make it space for the

2565
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,500
students to really use.

2566
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:46,980
I'm always impressed when I go down to the places packed.

2567
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:55,460
I was sure, back in the 60s, you find a few people point over the line, but that was

2568
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:02,180
not a lot, so you've turned it into a central learning experience for space for the kids,

2569
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:08,220
you know, I think it's terribly important, I think the transition library to a really

2570
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:11,260
part of the learning environment for the garage number students is, well, it's our

2571
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:16,420
experience, it's fun to be a part of it, so my wife and I are very interested in helping

2572
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:24,660
out anywhere we can, and hopefully we had a lot of experience with books and education

2573
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:30,460
and conveying information, so we think we'd be in some value.

2574
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:34,580
Well, I thank you very much for this, I appreciate quite a lot.

2575
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:35,580
Well, thank you.

2576
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,580
It's like good to help out.

2577
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,580
Sure.
