1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, I'm Bill Robbins, formerly William G. Robbins. Today is March 27th, 2012, and we're in the third floor of the Oregon State University Library, and this is an interview.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm having to do with my longtime esteemed colleague William Appleman Williams.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So that is what we're doing. Our transplant just didn't quite much day.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You could give us a little context, though, just kind of read from the aspects of your own life.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, I'm Connecticut Yankee by birth, and have some resonance with Bill Williams career.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Career, I spent four years in the Navy. I did not, however, attend the Naval Academy. I was in the listed man right out of high school.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I went to undergraduate school after the Navy experience. I was out actually five years out of high school before I went to school.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Got a degree in a small teachers college in Connecticut.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I spent one semester at Syracuse University, and then moved to Oregon in 1963, taught school for one year, and began taking graduate seminars at the University of Oregon.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And finished a master's degree in British history at the University of Oregon in 1965, moved east to the University of Maine, where I had ambitions to do a PhD.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It didn't work out there for reasons that are not pertinent to this discussion, and I returned to Oregon in the fall of 1966 in American history.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And we see the PhD in 1969, and began teaching here and there on visiting appointments in wound up at Oregon State in 1971, and I was here for three or four years on visiting appointments.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And one of them, I know, was when Bill Williams took a research leave, and with the proposal that I'd be some of the money used to be hired to hire me as another interim appointment for that year.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then I got on a tenure track, and so I was at Oregon State from 1971, full-time until 1999, and I went half-time and retired full-time in 2002.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So Wayne's came there as the 1968?

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, briefly, and it's a fun story, and I'm glad you asked that question.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was a graduate student. I first discovered Bill Williams when I was at the University of Maine, and it had directly to do with the anti-war movement having to do with Vietnam.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And sometime in the fall of 1965, or spring of 1966, I started reading Williams.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I read tragedy of American diplomacy first, and then I read articles that he wrote various publications, minority of one, and the progressive, having to do with American foreign relations and so forth.

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And so when I came back to return to the University of Oregon to work on the PhD, I was fully vested in my research project, but I was also fully vested in anti-war activities on campus and Eugene community.

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And by the fall of 1968 when Bill moved from Madison to Corvallis, I was writing my doctoral dissertation at that point, and stunned to hear that he had moved to Oregon State.

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I mean, speechless. And I had to do with a perception, mostly erroneous, that we had as graduate students at the University of Oregon, that the Oregon State University was a bastion of reactionary politics and so forth, that I learned, of course, was a far stretch of what I came here and joined the faculty.

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But to make this story to bring it current, in late January of 1969, the University of Oregon history faculty invited Bill to campus.

24
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And it was his first appearance back on campus since he left. He had been there before, but giving a formal address on campus.

25
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I think it was January 29, 1969 or January 28, 69, and it was the onset of a huge snowstorm that you can go in the newspapers, you can find it, but it was on a Friday night, and he spoke to a packed hall in herb memorial room 105.

26
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And I was there as we're all of my graduate student colleagues who were a pretty eclectic and very bright bunch, maybe the best group of graduate students at the UFO ever had in history, I guess.

27
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Anyway, I can't remember Bill's, just what the substance of his address was, but the next day, it's mounting snowfall.

28
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He spoke to graduate students in Chapman Hall, which was a place where graduate students would gather, and I can't remember what tickler, college or department of Chapman Hall was associated with.

29
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And it was kind of a Q&A, and of course I was enamored with Bill, and I was all fired up with a major question, I wanted to know what drove him to become the person he did, something like that, and I'm sure I articulated my question like an idiot.

30
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I will never forget his response, this is a direct quote, what the hell kind of a question is that.

31
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Totally humiliated, and after I got to know Bill, I would retell him that story, and he said, I wouldn't have said something.

32
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, I said you sure did. So, well, in other words, Bill was a historian's historian, if you read the essays that Paul's working on on the unpublished essays, they're, they reak with history, with a sense of history.

33
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And my question had nothing to do with that, had to do with political activism, presentist politics, and so forth, just the opposite of the kind of person that Bill was.

34
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't remember it went on from there, and I think I started looking furtively out the window at the mounting snow, and I don't know how Bill ever, ever got home, he was living in Newport at the time.

35
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And because Eugene came to a standstill, I remember 43 inches of snowfall in little over 24 hours.

36
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, it sounds like tragedy was an important act in Congress, what is well.

37
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Contour is much greater than tragedy. I used to say, on my desk, I had Webster's dictionary in contours of American history, and it influenced in a large way, because I consulted it regularly,

38
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and teaching United States history, and I can't remember the details, but I can say that when I was teaching Pacific Northwest history about the Lewis and Clark expedition, I consult the index and find Lewis and Clark and Jefferson and so forth,

39
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and I remember a line that I would quote to students from tragedy, from contours of American history, that Jefferson was the great American Democrat, Jefferson was the great American empire builder, right in the same bogs.

40
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, contours and Paul Bill bears us out was a major, major book that historians have still have to contend with.

41
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So your experience was not isolated like this in terms of the impact that would happen in Newport?

42
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, no, I don't think so, but beyond that, when I came here and joined the faculty in 1971, in my constant association with Bill, I began to think much more seriously, and it really did direct my research for publication for many years as his notion of political economy.

43
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The intersection between politics and economics, and here I became interested in natural resource industries and the intersection of politics and economics and something that has stayed with me ever since.

44
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What sounds like you came to us about three years after the wings that you know, much about the course that we're hiring employees.

45
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I do and mainly from Bill, and I should have brought my doctoral dissertation with me because I have to say that in the fall of 1969, I taught a US history course here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and it was Tuesdays and Thursdays when Bill was here because that was his schedule.

46
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And he read my dissertation and he wrote in his beautiful script, just some comments, and I'll try to remember to scan them and send you copies because they're interesting. He took young scholars seriously.

47
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And what was your question? Oh, yes. Well, the whole background to that is failing marriage to Corinne, and I'm not sure if Paul Bill was all together right about Bill's, Paul, would argue that Bill's theme was that a woman's place was in the home.

48
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I'm not so sure about that, and I'm not sure my wife would agree with that either, but that's Paul's view.

49
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And there's enough evidence to say that's true, and Corinne's restlessness of wanting to go on and get a degree as it turns out at Portland State because they had a social work program.

50
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm losing my train of thought, do you response to your question?

51
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Right. He made friends with George Carson here, and I think that's clear from recorded literature, and they liked each other. That was important.

52
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And George was very bright, and he was no one's fool, and he liked Bill, and then there were negotiations about the possibility of hiring Williams.

53
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And the president, I, at the time I think, was Jensen, and Paul Buell has it that a dean was involved, because there were questions raised about Bill's trustworthiness because he was a radical and so forth.

54
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I remember Bill saying it was Jensen, and that president Jensen put in a call to Fred Harvey Harrington, and I don't know whether Harrington yet had become president of University of Wisconsin or not, but asked him, and I remember Bill saying it was Jensen, who called Harrington, and asked him the Williams was trustworthy,

55
00:13:37,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and Bill said, Harrington said, he is, and Bill, I remember him saying, I get the job, and that's about all I can add, and I know that there's correspondence George Carson, and I think Tom McClinnick, Tom was sitting in, I know for George, part of time when George was on leave, so I don't know, but that should, all that correspondence is here.

56
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And do you have any sense of what is assessment of the University, or do you have a partner with I do you write?

57
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, I hadn't changed much when I came here in 1971, and there was a dearth of people publishing, and that's being very kindly, but that wasn't unusual in most land-bent universities and other places either.

58
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:47,000
One of the more active people publishing at the time in colonial history was Daryl Wax, and he would, when Tom McClinnick stepped down from being chair of the department, Daryl became chair of the department.

59
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Late 70s, something like this, and so Daryl was chair through the rest of Bill's tenure on the faculty, but other than that, you know, I, one well-known member of the faculty, was promoted to full professor on the basis of three articles published,

60
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and I was going up for full professor the same year, and the dean at the time, who's died a long time ago, tried to get me with draw my bid for promotion to full professor, because I hadn't been associate professor for very long either.

61
00:15:35,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But I was publishing articles, and I had a book in press, and I remember it was just before the Christmas break, he asked me suggested that I would draw my candidacy, and I was a little bit offended, but I was talking to the dean, and I said that, you know, I thought that I had the credentials, my resume was strong enough for promotion,

62
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and I had mine this other person, it's going up for promotion, and I assured him that I wasn't going to jump off to all buildings or anything if I was denied, and anyway, it was turned down, and I learned subsequently that the vote among the senior review team here was close.

63
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, but I remember talking to the person who actually become good friends with, since who told me, and he got promoted, was that you just have to wait your turn, which didn't share my Irish sensibilities very much, but those were interesting times, and I was feisty,

64
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and cocky in some ways, but I was publishing a lot, and my first book was published in 1982, Bill Reddy, introductory chapter, I'll never forget it, before I sent it off for publication, do you want to hear that story?

65
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I wrote it and re-wrote it, revised it, until I was sure that it was near perfect, and my family and I were living out on the Alcy Highway at the time, and we drove down our long driveway, and for some reason, she was driving, and I reached in our mailbox and pulled out, there it was, with Williams' handwriting,

66
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:17,000
opened it up as we were driving in the town and pulled out the manuscript, and I told this to graduate students, red-panned, it looked like he had cut himself, and bled, I might perfect writing, but, oh did I learn about writing, not just redundancies, but repetitive word use,

67
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the use of that, in which the proper use of that, in which the proper use of these in those, and those are only, I should have saved it, I don't think I have that anymore, but I was a priceless piece of editorial work.

68
00:18:40,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It took me a while to, as I used to say, when I first came here speaking to Bill, I always felt like I had a hot potato in my mouth, but I got over that, and I would say by 1973, 74, you know, I was sort of beyond that, and became friends,

69
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and eventually very good friends, and I was divorced in 1972, so Bill never met my first wife, and I was single for three years,

70
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Bill and Wendy were married in, fall of 72, December of 72, they went to British Columbia, I think, to Vancouver, got married, and I didn't remarry until the summer of 1975, and this is what Paul Biel misses in his biography, Bill Williams, is his sense of play,

71
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:10,000
even the memos he would write to the history department, which are fun reading, part of it is his sense of play, sometimes very cryptic, but a beautiful sense of play,

72
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Bill and Wendy came to our wedding, and when we walked out of the church at the end of the ceremony, tied to ornamentation on the outside of the church were balloons, brought by Bill.

73
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, my next question sort of fits along, and this may have an interesting note that more about his personality.

74
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, Paul mentions this in his biography, but I don't, I don't think he struck how important it was to Bill, is on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we would go down to the Corvales Hotel, and the Corvales Hotel in the bottom floor that's since long been gone were two great pool tables,

75
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and you could buy beer or beverages there, and we would shoot pool, and Bill was the best pool player, and there would be Ben Merzek from our department, who was kind of a crotchity cranky guy, really based on wonderful healing being, but sometimes difficult to get along with.

76
00:21:40,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I mean, even for his best friends, one was Bill, and I was a good friend of Ben's too. Ben was a good pool player, Peter Copeck, who was the founding director of the Center for Humanities, was a regular there, and there would be various others who would join for different times.

77
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But those were always wonderful get together, and then Bill would catch the Greyhound back to Newport.

78
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That was part of it. Bill, it varied from politics to history to sports, and I know there was a television set.

79
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And it could have been after the Corvales Hotel closed, and we moved on to somewhere else, and I think it was, and I can't remember where we played pool after that.

80
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But it was during the baseball playoffs, and when Nolan Ryan pitched for that Houston Astros, and Bill was, he was a preeminent sports fan, and especially baseball.

81
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And he was enamored with watching Nolan Ryan pitch. Well, he was a pain in the neck when, you know, his turn to shoot, and he's up watching television, watching Nolan Ryan pitch.

82
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But Paul Bill misses that part of Bill's life, and those are very rich part of his life too.

83
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And you probably, I'm sure this is in my brief biograph of a sketch of Bill in the Fesheriff, a wonderful line.

84
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I think it was from Lloyd Gardner and not Walter LaFabre, that in his seminars, Bill would charge them during fall semester when the aches were always playing in the playoffs, or there was no playoffs.

85
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And he simply won the American League Championship in the World Series.

86
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And all of his graduate students would be anti, they'd be yanky haters, and Bill would charge them that they just, they didn't understand power.

87
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
They understand power, you have to understand the aches.

88
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was neat to see how he could take sports metaphor and switch it into a discussion of, you know, his kind of history, his approach to history.

89
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Did he take an interest in the local teams?

90
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh yes, he was a very close fan of Ralph Miller's great basketball teams in the late 70s and early 80s, really.

91
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And he actually probably met Ralph on different occasions, I can't remember the details, but he knew and liked him.

92
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
He had Ralph's daughter Shannon in his class at some point.

93
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And Shannon also was a student in one of my classes as well.

94
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And she was on the women's basketball team here, and very good.

95
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes, right.

96
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
How would it sense in women?

97
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, I've given you a flare for that already, I think.

98
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:13,000
His play with words, especially in memos to the history department, which I think I saved most of them.

99
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And they, you, I'm over between my collection and whatever you gather elsewhere, you, they're great reading.

100
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And they're also steeped in historical metaphors.

101
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And in what I always enjoyed about those is the sense of play that, you know, this was part fun, part humor.

102
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And so forth, and that you never could take yourself all that seriously.

103
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I should have better responses to, but that was part of Bill's persona, I think, that you never take yourself all that seriously.

104
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And I think that that's part of his differences with Arthur, Arthur Meyer, Slesinger Jr.

105
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
was that Slesinger certainly took himself very seriously.

106
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I assume this personality there is before it's not about conversation, or a little bit.

107
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh, yes.

108
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I have to say one other thing, I told this to Paul Buil when he interviewed me when he was working on the biography.

109
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That Bill, I told him Bill is the best idea person I've ever met.

110
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And Paul came close to agreeing, but he had one other person in mind, the best idea person he ever met.

111
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And that's CLR James, the Caribbean Marxist Revolutionary, and one of the greatest cricketeers of all time.

112
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You might check Paul's biography of CLR James.

113
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Where do you think this came from before it is?

114
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The best idea is exactly the brightest.

115
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, you know, it's to use the old metaphor of thinking outside the box, no one thought outside the box like Williams.

116
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And Paul does a good job of that.

117
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That he looked at historical questions from the side or kind of an opaque view.

118
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And he saw raised questions that no one ever raised before, or thought about things in a unique and different way.

119
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And that's what I think his work is so transformative in American foreign relations.

120
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because, you know, old-style diplomatic history never looked at it from the approach that Bill did.

121
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know, his book, the roots of the modern American Empire is a kind of a classic study.

122
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Looking at agriculture and agriculture and its search for markets.

123
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And the force that that had in the late 19th century, and shaping American foreign relations certainly is a, you know, powerful way of looking at that.

124
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah. Oh, beard. In fact, beard would be a common point of discussion over the pool table.

125
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And every once in a while, Lloyd Gardner or Walt with a favor, somebody like that would come up with something out of the beard papers.

126
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
All the beard burned always papers, I think.

127
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But it was a reference to beard that they found in somebody else's correspondence and so forth.

128
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He would share that with me, and probably some of it may be in what I've turned over to the archives here, the collection.

129
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So, yeah, beard was a constant point of reference.

130
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I, you know, of course, well aware of beard, and especially his point about the influence on the shaping of America's early period of history.

131
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean, they making the constitutional convention that the constitutional makers were not some of our current politicians today descended from on high, but rather they had their hand in the cookie jars.

132
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So, that was part of my understanding to of political economy.

133
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Did you ever, is it the first time that you deployed?

134
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
No, no, I don't even know where it was.

135
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No, I, in fact, by the time Carl and I visited their wall port, and I think the two of us were there together.

136
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I never visited Bill there alone.

137
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Then he and Wendy were married by the time I was making trips to the coast to visit them.

138
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What Bill did was he bought two cabins, and then when he and Wendy were married, they built a petition, which housed a kitchen, a small dining room, and so forth.

139
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then one end became a study in their bedroom and the other end was a living room.

140
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then eventually after we knew them several years, they built a bigger bedroom and a garage over the other end, but it was very livable and, you know, very appropriate for them.

141
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And it backed up right on the bluff over the ocean.

142
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
As you probably know.

143
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
When we talked earlier before, you're quite in my study, I don't want to be doing it.

144
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Later I didn't do direct lessons with what that state was like.

145
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This was not recorded though, that was over coffee.

146
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In foster, Spartan, beautiful desk, bookcase, hardbound books, not many of them.

147
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The study was not, you know, filled with wall to wall books.

148
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's the needest study I've ever seen.

149
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's probably an expression of bills, bills work.

150
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We talked about this a little bit already, but how did the logistics work out of building on it?

151
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, he had an agreement when he signed his contract that he wouldn't have to be here every day, because he wanted to live on the coast.

152
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And, you know, wanted to teach a Tuesday, Thursday schedule.

153
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I know there was some resentment over that.

154
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was privy to it.

155
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And I thought it was nonsense because it came from people who were doing nothing and had no had zero prestige in terms of the history, the historical profession.

156
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And he, Bill gave his all to the department.

157
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
He did his share, his fair share of classes.

158
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
He had by students and we had individual student advising, although probably not too many.

159
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Students who matriculated in his class under graduates.

160
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I would say probably 98% of them, never knew who they were taking the class went.

161
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And a striking example of this, I was attending a Western history meeting in Sacramento.

162
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And I was in an elevator.

163
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I fellow saw my identification card for the conference.

164
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And asked me, he said, is William, William still teaching?

165
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I said, yes, he said, do you know I had a class with him as an undergraduate?

166
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And I never knew who he was.

167
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So that was kind of an eye opener for me.

168
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Well, something I never forgot because, you know, wow.

169
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So he would take the bus over and more and teach you to take it back?

170
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It takes about, yeah.

171
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And I think it was a seven o'clock return bus.

172
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And he would be home.

173
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well, by the time I was here, he was living in Wallport.

174
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And so he would leave his car in Newport or Wendy would drive pick him up and something like that.

175
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't know how that worked out.

176
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So he didn't even remember that?

177
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No.

178
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He didn't.

179
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And when he did stay over, if he stayed over Tuesday and Wednesday night,

180
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
because he had other commitments.

181
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And he did that pretty regularly.

182
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He stayed at the townhouse.

183
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And it's still at townhouses, isn't it?

184
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And south-fourth.

185
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And it's Tommy's bar and grill.

186
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then it was just the townhouse bar.

187
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so we talked about it for a while.

188
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So we talked about it for a while.

189
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
No.

190
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Corvall is so tellin' I can't remember where we migrated for a while.

191
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And then the townhouse.

192
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We would get together there for drinks after we're at sometimes.

193
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Can't remember.

194
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
There is now.

195
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah.

196
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah.

197
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm watching I've got about 18, 15 minutes or so.

198
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
How do you characterize his work style and work with his?

199
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Well, I have to back up because by the time we were talking about writing

200
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
drafts of papers and so forth.

201
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And he would use long yellow pads.

202
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He'd called it full scat.

203
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I don't know if that's probably, you know,

204
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
a early 20th century term.

205
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And I used the eight to half by 11 pads.

206
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Now they're lined and so forth.

207
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And he used the longer ones, 14 inch, I suspect.

208
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And he would write drafts of material on that in long hand.

209
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And then he would transfer that.

210
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He would type it on a first rough draft after doing some editing.

211
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So by the time he was doing that, it was more or less a third draft that he was typing

212
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
by the time he did that.

213
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I know that was part of his routine.

214
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And beyond that, you know, after he had, if he was writing,

215
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
let's say empire is a way of life or something.

216
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The process of revision, you know, once he had a manuscript,

217
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
completed, you know, I tend to go back through,

218
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
well, chapters individually and then the whole manuscript.

219
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But that's, of course, I'm using computers.

220
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And Bill never graduated to use the use of computers.

221
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But he was a fast typist too.

222
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And Pro, pretty error free, I think.

223
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I mean, if you look at his typescripts, they're pretty good.

224
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So let's begin with a quick, pretty generally devoted to reading writing that.

225
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I would say yes.

226
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And some of it late night.

227
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You know, he tended to work at night.

228
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And that was a habit.

229
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
He developed, you know, probably when he taught it to you role.

230
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And certainly when he was in Madison.

231
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
A house full of children, you know, two of Karin's.

235
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And then he and Karin had three children of their own.

236
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And he, at some point, seems to have initially sort of resented having to do that.

237
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But he didn't want to go ahead.

238
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

239
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think he worked.

240
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You know, I mean, you so incredibly productive then.

241
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
In addition to turning out 42 PhDs in 11 years, you imagine that.

242
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

243
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Now some of them were still finishing up obviously when he was here.

244
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And I don't know when he told me at one point, you know, he had placed his last candidate in a job.

245
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And that could have been the mid 70s.

246
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And it might have been Peggy Morley or Henry Berger.

247
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I can't remember whom.

248
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
He talked a bit about charging in concert.

249
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
He's been doing functional books.

250
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There's sort of a sense that this scholarship kind of declined a little bit.

251
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And just call you during the OSU.

252
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They do call it on that.

253
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Well, he said he would never write another book.

254
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And actually my wife and I called him on it when he published.

255
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Empires a way of life.

256
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And actually America, a conference a revolutionary world.

257
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think he even made that comment before that book.

258
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But he didn't call those books.

259
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
He called them extended essays.

260
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So there was a difference.

261
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And well, then you could call tragedy of American diplomacy.

262
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You know, an extended essay.

263
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Whether, you know, like his first book, American Russian relations

264
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
or roots of the modern American Empire, which were detailed, annotated, documented books.

265
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Maybe he called those books.

266
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't know.

267
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But I would say I was never enamored by American

268
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Conference a Revolutionary World.

269
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But Empires a way of life is an incredible piece of writing.

270
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And I was telling my friend, Sunday, historian, who's visiting our home,

271
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
that empires a way of life.

272
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know how many different languages has been translated into you, probably.

273
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No.

274
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Japanese, Chinese, Italian, German, French,

275
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
added fun item.

276
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And it's a testimony to the influence of his career.

277
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The body of his work.

278
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And I think, as a capsule, and my reading of Paul Biel

279
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
kind of reminded me of this, is how important that book is.

280
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
After reading Paul's biography, I want to go back and read Empire.

281
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's part of this sort of drawing.

282
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And the documentation of the idea.

283
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It seemed like that was one of the real defining things.

284
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Right.

285
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A lot of people have asked me about that and think, you know,

286
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because I was Bill's good friend for so many years,

287
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that I knew more than, you know, the snippets that he published here and there about community.

288
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But community and democracy with a small D.

289
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And pretty much it's, everything it's in is writing.

290
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You know, there's nothing hidden anywhere else.

291
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Kind of an exploration of ideas.

292
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I think that he was interested in.

293
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I think it all has its roots in Atlantic, Iowa.

294
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Which I stopped in there on a Sunday morning when I was traveling from east to west.

295
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I think I was back east and I was coming west and had breakfast.

296
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And, you know, it's like a lot of other small Iowa towns.

297
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You drive in and you find a diner and, you know, you're going in the Sunday morning everyone.

298
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's there for breakfast.

299
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I don't remember how much I bought it.

300
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Did he ever reflect on that life of gravity?

301
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh, yes.

302
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah.

303
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah.

304
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And his grandparents.

305
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And it's funny.

306
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It makes Paul makes more of mildered.

307
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think than mod his grandmother.

308
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But mod and what's his name?

309
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
His grandfather, Tossie.

310
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Applement.

311
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Porter.

312
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Porter, inkler.

313
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Applement.

314
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
They were a real presence in his life.

315
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And, you know, Paul makes, I think,

316
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
more of a psychological play on, you know, the boy who grew up without a father or something.

317
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And Porter was a pretty pronounced presence in his life.

318
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And, you know, my association with Bill.

319
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I mean, his grandparents were very important.

320
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And he was very proud of his mother, of course.

321
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I have one other thing I want to say about his upbringing in Atlantic.

322
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And he makes mention of 1927.

323
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So Bill would have been six years old, maybe seven years old when Charles Linnberg flew over Atlantic.

324
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And supposedly, his father's,

325
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
this may be an apocryl story.

326
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And Bill remembers seeing the plane in the dipping of the wing and so forth.

327
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I've always wondered about that.

328
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
My Bill was a good storyteller, very good storyteller.

329
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So I wonder if this is something fashionable that, you know, he remembers from his childhood and so forth.

330
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I tend to have those same, it's probably romantic notions myself in my own childhood.

331
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I think we have this graphic actually worth some of that.

332
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Is that right?

333
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, then it's not an apocryl story.

334
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah?

335
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think it's no more about his teachings now.

336
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It was eclectic,

337
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
secretic.

338
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He wanted to engage students in dialogue.

339
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And I would say it probably worked greatly for sophisticated, for older students,

340
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and not sophisticated, but within acquiring minds.

341
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And I know because I tried it myself.

342
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And it worked one term then I tried it with a larger class.

343
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And I had to give it up and went back to lecturing.

344
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And I would have a lecture format, a framework of discussion in mind.

345
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But I don't know, Bill, you know, he was a master at that.

346
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I think that he would lecture from a general outline.

347
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
He would just have three pieces of paper with notes in his beautiful penmanship.

348
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But they were profound.

349
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
When I was away at a conference one time, he met with a night class that I taught.

350
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And he left me with, it was a colonial history class.

351
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And it was very early fall of term.

352
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And he left me with a copy of the notes.

353
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And they're in my papers in your collection.

354
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And they were, I mean it was unbelievable.

355
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The world view of what the coming of Europeans to the American continent did.

356
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And I used to do it in more immediate ways.

357
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Bill's horror was framed into how you impose on the people new languages,

358
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
new frames of reference, new world views, and so forth.

359
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I'd have to go back and look at it.

360
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But I even put that in one of my books inside of his.

361
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's very profound.

362
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So you came to us to see how the graduate program is because you have a sense of frustration

363
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to go without any doubt.

364
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
No.

365
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Despite what Paul Bill said, I think.

366
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
One of the reasons for coming here was to get away from training graduate students

367
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
because he had enough training graduate students.

368
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And he wanted to settle in a place where he didn't have to shovel snow in the winter.

369
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And he wanted to be close to the ocean.

370
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
People asked me about this.

371
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You know, at conferences, when they first learned that I taught at Oregon State in Bill Williams,

372
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I was like, why does he want to come there?

373
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I would repeat these three reasons.

374
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I had never heard anything other than that.

375
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
He told that to interviewers.

376
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,000
He would tell it to Carla and me when he'd had a couple of bourbons.

377
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And he never said anything else.

378
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
How about the college students?

379
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Well, I think there was some sense of frustration with that.

380
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Obviously.

381
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But he would be very proud of some of the papers.

382
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
His students did here.

383
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I know that from time to time.

384
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
My first music is early in the morning.

385
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He's going to respect a lot of his music.

386
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, I'm not sure that he was all that rigorous, a grader.

387
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I can't, you know, I was less interested in those kinds of things.

388
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And you mentioned that you do a lot of fighting?

389
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, it's hard to say.

390
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
He did have, you know, we all shared advising.

391
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And usually they were students from our own classes.

392
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And so we would have advisees assigned that way.

393
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I had huge classes.

394
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I know in the 70s I was teaching in the industry.

395
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And I was, in fact, in retrospect, overburden with students.

396
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I had to use different kinds of russes to go through grading exams.

397
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So, what?

398
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
This one more question.

399
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm interested in my ask time to move on.

400
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
What sort of role would you assume within the department?

401
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You've never experienced a share of the department.

402
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You've experienced some of these issues.

403
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Right?

404
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Do that exist in specific areas?

405
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Do you have kind of an important role to send this to your faculty?

406
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Well, I know some of the resentment early on when I was hired.

407
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Jellous accusations that Williams was turning to develop a department full of radical young people

408
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and so forth.

409
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And part of it was focused on me and part of it was focused on a young French historian

410
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that the department hired to teach African history and French history.

411
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And this fellow was very bright.

412
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
He was very flawed and he never got tenure.

413
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I think by the time this fellow was denied tenure and that was, let's say, by 76 or so.

414
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He was gone.

415
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
That had fallen by the wayside.

416
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But that was very prevalent at first.

417
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I need to go out.

418
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
One of the best pieces I thought of that appeared in Northwest newspapers.

419
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And I don't know the exact date was a piece that foster church published in the Sunday

420
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oregonian in, had to be about 1983-84 something like that.

421
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I don't know when exactly it was, but I know I clipped a copy of that.

422
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I don't know whether I'm sure you have it, but it's, and the best part of that, I think,

423
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
is the photograph of Bill on the back deck of his home looking south along the coast.

424
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

425
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's a great photograph.

426
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's on the back of Paul's book too.

427
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So I'm just continuing on.

428
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Is there anything more to talk about in the book?

429
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Except the over-weaning jealousy thing that I mentioned just before we break took the break

430
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
was something that bothered me.

431
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And part of it, I think, had to do with those of us who are really interested in building a department

432
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
in which people published, taught and engaged in the profession, with the professional meetings,

433
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
gave papers and so forth, and those who didn't.

434
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And I think that some of that went away by the time of Bill's retirement 1985.

435
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But there were still sharp divisions in the department.

436
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And between what kind of was the quasi-progressive Williams faction and those opposed.

437
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And it was pretty pronounced and it lasted until I served one year as department chair.

438
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And I did nothing brilliant, but there were four people in the department who came to me

439
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and I was an interim appointment.

440
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:47,000
At different times during the first ever and after I was named acting chair in expressed real concern

441
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
about the direction of the department.

442
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And what I told them was that, you know, I was at Democrat with a lower case D

443
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and that I had no intention of making end runs around people or pushing any special direction

444
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
in the department, any ideological agendas.

445
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And by that time, however, the department was changing a lot.

446
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
There was a cadre of people who had published books.

447
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You had to have a book to get tenure and so forth.

448
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And by the time I was through with my year, three of those four people came to me and told me what a good job I was doing.

449
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And I wasn't doing anything brilliant except, you know, we were a different department than.

450
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And those kinds of factions went away.

451
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
But that was part of, you know, the hangover from Bill's presence here.

452
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You know, he was president of the organization of American historians for help, you know, in 1981.

453
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I would say his presence within the University was the regard to do something for a star or celebrity.

454
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh, yes.

455
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I mean, people knew who he was and presidents knew who he was.

456
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
He actually got on well with John Bern and you should interview John.

457
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yeah.

458
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You know, because Bill assumed with good reason that he could speak to John Bern as an equal.

459
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And there were a work many faculty.

460
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I don't think who presumed that they would speak to the president of the University as an equal.

461
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And Bill did.

462
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Bill played a great role and you'd have to look into the records of the Center for Humanities

463
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and getting the center a major endowment.

464
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And it became part of the University, not the foundation.

465
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What's the development of OSU Foundation?

466
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
He had four major objectives in a push and one was the Center for the Humanities.

467
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And Bill was a major player in that.

468
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And obviously, because of his prestige, his stature and the profession.

469
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And he lent his voice to that.

470
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And I'm sure that the Center and I know Peter Copeck was always very thankful to Bill for that.

471
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It was the Center, something that he, he, he had a sort of movement in the player.

472
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No, it was Peter's idea.

473
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So, Williams was enlisted.

474
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Williams was enlisted.

475
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah.

476
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Bill was not a player.

477
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It began as the Humanities Development Office over in Morland Hall.

478
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And it kind of morphed beyond there.

479
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And then when it became a full-blown Center for the Humanities,

480
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that's when Bill was brought in as a good friend of Peter's along with a few other people.

481
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And he was a major force in how that worked out.

482
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We talked about the social setting of the full table.

483
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's larger than the gathering.

484
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's a professional gathering.

485
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's perhaps this kind of person who enjoyed making the room more to be.

486
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
No.

487
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So, do you talk a little bit more about how you sort of operate in that situation?

488
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, department of meetings?

489
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
No, it might get a professional gathering of sorts.

490
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
No, I, he was, I'm people like to talk to him.

491
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And I've only been around him at professional meetings when he was with his former graduate students.

492
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Who were, they were friends.

493
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I mean, they were former graduate students.

494
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It was Lloyd Gardner and Walter of the Faber.

495
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Ed Craypole and others.

496
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
They were just dear friends.

497
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
He liked them.

498
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They liked him.

499
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And when they came here to give talks, Bill would introduce Lloyd or Walt of the Faber as someone he knew.

500
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
When he first started teaching at the University of Wisconsin.

501
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And he said, you know, it's like your students are smarter than you are or something.

502
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You know, he paid them great compliments.

503
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And I, I just remember my first social occasion.

504
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Carl was with me.

505
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It was when Bill, the organization of American historians, was meeting in San Francisco.

506
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And we were at the high at Regency down on the waterfront.

507
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And it was late in the afternoon cocktail hour and kind of a rotating bar at the top.

508
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You'd see the San Francisco or the Bay Area skyline all around.

509
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And Carl and I were there with Walter of the Faber, Lloyd Gardner.

510
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't think Ed Craypole was there.

511
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't remember Jerry McColley being there.

512
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I was a couple of other people from the organization of American historians.

513
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And it was a fun gathering in Lloyd Gardner was probably the most garalace of the group.

514
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And because Lloyd had, you always had it, glinted as I about some devilish story.

515
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And he was a better storyteller in some ways, the Bill.

516
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You know, and Bill was just part of the crowd.

517
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
We've mentioned his presence in the orientation of American points.

518
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
He's very proud of that.

519
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yes, he was.

520
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It was recognition long deferred.

521
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
As Paul Biel says, Eugene Jenovacy had been president three years prior to Bill.

522
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And, you know, it's, it's, it's funny people who have controversial or quasi radical positions.

523
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know, become presidents of major organizations long after the fact.

524
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And one of, I just learned in my own field of Western American history.

525
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Donald Worcester is the forthcoming president of the Western history association.

526
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And he's retiring.

527
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And Don, in a lot of our views, should have been president, you know, in the early 1980s.

528
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
When he was publishing, you know, good books.

529
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
He's published good books ever since then.

530
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But he's been a person who's been a bit edgy.

531
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Like, maybe not as much as Williams.

532
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But he's finally going to be president.

533
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And he knew Bill spent time in this house.

534
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And this was not an electric bill.

535
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
He had an engine that he was trying to add.

536
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yes, he did.

537
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
He worked very hard in his year as president.

538
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And started, I think, something that Gertal Learner, who finished, who followed Bill as president, gave him a lot of credit for his initiatives.

539
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Although, I didn't bear fruit, you know, especially with the National Endowment for Humanities.

540
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
He got nowhere.

541
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
He appealed to several historians who made thousands of dollars, writing textbooks.

542
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And he had 15 or 10 or 15 of them in mind.

543
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And he wanted each one of them to donate a thousand dollars to create this.

544
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And he put five grand in himself.

545
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Do this and to no avail.

546
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
A lot of lines is sort of a bit further down.

547
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Is that we can actually do it for age.

548
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You also like the one you see when you're not a doctor.

549
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah.

550
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah.

551
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah.

552
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Paul makes mention of that.

553
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
My answer is so what?

554
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
No.

555
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:34,000
When he did get the honorary doctor at Columbia College or something in Chicago, his address had to do with Duke Wellington.

556
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I remember that.

557
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I remember reading the talk.

558
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He would give Carl and I copies of his talks.

559
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, yes.

560
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Love jazz.

561
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah.

562
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Miles Davis.

563
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Pretty close.

564
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Dizzy Gillespie.

565
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Who's the one I just mentioned?

566
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
No.

567
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Duke Wellington.

568
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah.

569
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
They were kind of classic jazz.

570
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And I know when we would go to the coast he invariably have Miles Davis.

571
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Miles Davis on his stereo.

572
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
He fished.

573
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
The ocean.

574
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I went fishing with him once.

575
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We didn't catch anything.

576
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We went down on the rocks and yahats.

577
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And we stopped.

578
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I said to stop in a store when I was coming through a wall port to get some bait.

579
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And then I drove up to Bill's place.

580
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And then we drove south of yahats.

581
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah.

582
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
He liked to fish.

583
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
He loved.

584
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We have some of his photography in our house.

585
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And his photography goes back to evidently his childhood.

586
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And we have a.

587
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I don't think you have a copy.

588
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But here I doubt.

589
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Of a photograph that he took when he was a student in a necklace.

590
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And it is striking.

591
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I mean it's so damn creative.

592
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:20,000
He climbed up on a trance over one of the major public buildings at the Naval Academy.

593
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And on a Sunday.

594
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And the sunlight is shining through the door.

595
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And people who walk through.

596
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
When they're approaching they cast shadows.

597
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And there was a woman evidently approaching the door.

598
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And he captured her shadow from up high over the trance.

599
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
And we have it framed in our house.

600
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And it's.

601
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We call it not.

602
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Maybe marble and laid floor or something black and white.

603
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And it's a black and white photograph.

604
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And I imagine it may be black and white in real life.

605
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And then he would take close ups of items along the coast.

606
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Like a rusty hinge somewhere.

607
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Reclose to the water.

608
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And or.

609
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Nirally wood that had been weathered.

610
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And so forth.

611
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And we have several of those.

612
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Those were wedding guests.

613
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So.

614
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And he had photographic exhibits too.

615
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I know Paul mentioned when the new bridge was being built in.

616
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Well, for it.

617
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Across the.

618
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Elsie.

619
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That's the only photographic exhibit that I know he did.

620
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
He may have done others.

621
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But that was one of his.

622
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Advocations.

623
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And Paul mentions that he went back to building model airplanes again.

624
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Is.

625
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Later.

626
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
After he retired.

627
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Do you have any of those here?

628
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Don't the.

629
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The photographs or the model airplane.

630
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
What happened to them?

631
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Ward is some ward may have them.

632
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
He'd be a good person interview.

633
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:24,000
There's several references about it.

634
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And.

635
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
No, that's.

636
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And.

637
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And.

638
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I don't think Wendy liked that.

639
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The biography.

640
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
She didn't like the references to womanizing.

641
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And.

642
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And.

643
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah, you know, this.

644
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
She was visiting us.

645
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Staying with us, actually.

646
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And.

647
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
When we lived in full moon.

648
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And.

649
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The only my only response to Wendy was that I had been with.

650
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
In thick and thin.

651
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
When he was drunk sober.

652
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Or he never was really drunk.

653
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Or points in between.

654
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And he never ever said anything.

655
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Negative about Wendy.

656
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I had to tell her that.

657
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And I remember I had tears in my eyes.

658
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I said, Wendy, you have to know this.

659
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And he also could recover.

660
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And I know that.

661
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
On the eve of his introduction of.

662
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I can't remember the guy who.

663
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The president elect introduces the president.

664
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It's a very prominent historian.

665
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
And I can't think of his name right at the moment.

666
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
In 1981 when we were at.

667
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
The hat Regency Carl and I.

668
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Satinal lounge with Bill.

669
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That afternoon.

670
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Bill had.

671
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
He might have had a drink or two before.

672
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And then he had another one with us.

673
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And.

674
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And boy, he was.

675
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And like I said, he built.

676
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You know, you.

677
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
You have to introduce.

678
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So and so it.

679
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Eight o'clock for his presidential address.

680
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And.

681
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
He said, OK.

682
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So he goes to his room.

683
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And he.

684
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And he.

685
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And we saw him.

686
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
At the dinner.

687
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I think.

688
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And it was like, you know, he.

689
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
He never had a drink.

690
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I'm really interested.

691
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And they were called.

692
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It's.

693
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Oh, they were great.

694
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah, I loved him.

695
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I saved a lot of them.

696
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
But.

697
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I'm sure I missed several.

698
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I used to clip them and put him in a file.

699
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It seems like a.

700
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
A visual.

701
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Thank for.

702
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
A story.

703
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
A.

704
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Such a regular basis.

705
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah.

706
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The.

707
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The.

708
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The.

709
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yes.

710
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yes.

711
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It started with the statesman journal because he knew.

712
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
One of the.

713
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Executives in the statesman journal.

714
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I can't remember whom.

715
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And they liked Ed Bassett.

716
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And they liked each other.

717
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And.

718
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And so that's how it started.

719
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And he got so and he used to tell me about this.

720
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The number the word limits.

721
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You know, on how you take an idea and develop.

722
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You know, an essay and you get it down to.

723
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I don't know what is 700 words or something like this.

724
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Whatever the column is.

725
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And, you know, he became very good at it.

726
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And then.

727
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I don't know.

728
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's a change in command at the.

729
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Statesman.

730
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I think he started with the statesman then the statesman journal.

731
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
They merged the two papers dead.

732
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And then he migrated to the Oregonian.

733
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And he did that.

734
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They are going in for a while.

735
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And I think that.

736
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Probably happened in part through David Sarason who was.

737
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
In his early.

738
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Period with the Oregonian.

739
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then.

740
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
They killed a piece.

741
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
That he wrote.

742
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And they paid him.

743
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You know, the kill fee.

744
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Never again.

745
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
That was it.

746
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You know.

747
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I mean, he took that as in a front.

748
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Right.

749
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah.

750
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
That's the.

751
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's the column.

752
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I think it was.

753
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's.

754
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And that idea.

755
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Mm-hmm.

756
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah.

757
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And they're very eclectic.

758
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Yeah.

759
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah.

760
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah.

761
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I've talked about a lot of the same.

762
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I guess I'm interested in going more about.

763
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm a client.

764
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm a client.

765
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
When.

766
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And sort of regulations of.

767
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Are our collective visits to walk or we always had a lot of fun.

768
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And invariably we would go out to dinner.

769
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Occasionally with friends.

770
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Or we'd go down there.

771
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
They'd have friends over.

772
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And the people I remember best were.

773
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
A couple named Barbara and Rob Davidson.

774
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And they were a lot of fun.

775
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Rob was quite a bit older than Barbara.

776
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And he passed on eventually.

777
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And I've seen Barbara just a couple of years ago.

778
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And she's since remarried.

779
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And she was a very good friend of Wendy's.

780
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But Bill liked both of them.

781
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And he liked Barbara enormously.

782
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And they were fun people.

783
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Occasionally they would have.

784
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,000
People from the OSU community over just a handful.

785
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
One of them was a fellow who retired in engineering.

786
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
David Bella.

787
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Yeah.

788
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You might want to interview him.

789
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
David's kind of a kind of class in his own right.

790
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You'll talk your ear off.

791
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That's where we met Dave.

792
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Dave was a really young professor.

793
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Bill thought, I don't a lot of him.

794
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
He liked people who, you know, good ideas.

795
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And so forth.

796
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And he prided himself on that.

797
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Dave was over there one time.

798
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I can't remember anyone from the department.

799
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Or a fellow named Jim Cole, who was here as a visiting professor.

800
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Jim was a good friend of Bill's.

801
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
But Jim was kind of crazy.

802
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
By me, Bill would say that.

803
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And Jim would admit that himself.

804
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And he was undisciplined.

805
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Bill, he's the fellow who didn't get tenure.

806
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Who came from Wisconsin.

807
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And was actually Harvey Goldberg's student.

808
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And a radical guy.

809
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And Bill had all kinds of problems with booze.

810
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And couldn't primarily booze.

811
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I think he couldn't finish his dissertation.

812
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
But he couldn't get anything published.

813
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And that was his own failing.

814
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I mean, it wasn't.

815
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And I was good friends with Bill.

816
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I think he couldn't finish his.

817
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Finish his dissertation.

818
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But he couldn't get anything published.

819
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Just snack food and drinks and talking about music.

820
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And just, you know, for a couple of hours.

821
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Bill and Wendy did.

822
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Yeah.

823
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Bridge.

824
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Carl and I never played bridge.

825
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So we were probably from people from the valley.

826
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
We're probably over there more often than anyone else.

827
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And on special occasions, Wendy's birthday.

828
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
We'd go and you got hot for dinner.

829
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
One time we went over.

830
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I think during the Christmas New Year's holiday.

831
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Carl and I stayed our kids were getting a little bit older than.

832
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So we left them in a motel.

833
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And went into your house for dinner with Bill and Wendy.

834
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And then we would call them every hour to make sure they were.

835
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
The kids were okay.

836
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
But then they were seven, eight years old or so.

837
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Talk a little bit more about Wendy.

838
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Well, she was her own person.

839
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And very, very bright.

840
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And very hardworking.

841
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
She loved a garden.

842
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Bill built her a little green house.

843
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Plastic.

844
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Where she could do pots and so forth.

845
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And she also played the piano.

846
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And she worked in a gift shop of a new port that's still operating.

847
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And I can't remember the name.

848
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
If my wife were here, she would remember.

849
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And yeah, she was a very hardworking woman.

850
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Very bright, very political.

851
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And I think that's where their friendship.

852
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Certainly, materialized because of Bill's politics.

853
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And Wendy, a Brit who came to Corvallus via British Columbia.

854
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You know, was kind of keen on somebody who had politics that she appreciated.

855
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So his relationship was something that they included.

856
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'm sure.

857
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah.

858
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And she read voraciously.

859
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I don't think she, you know, ever edited anything.

860
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Bill wrote her.

861
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
She, he might have, you know, when he made,

862
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
wrote public talks, he might just have a read it just to try it out on her.

863
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
There was something that he'd gone Australian or something.

864
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah.

865
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Carlin Wendy were very good friends.

866
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And, you know, we remain good friends to this day.

867
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But we talked about it as one of the see you a little bit.

868
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I don't know if there's any more share there.

869
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And it just did to America's big class that he'd gone.

870
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah.

871
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The two were one.

872
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Just to give you a quick answer.

873
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The maritime history class actually originated,

874
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I think, in part through the Center for Humanities.

875
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I know there were various of us.

876
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I wrote a course that I taught on community through the Center for Humanities.

877
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Bill did the maritime course.

878
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And there were some others.

879
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And I think, I can't remember the details.

880
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
But we got some stipend or something for doing that.

881
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It wasn't much.

882
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But, and that was kind of an, an avocation for Bill, you know,

883
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,000
touring off in the part of his affection for the sea and,

884
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
and maritime history and so forth.

885
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
To do something like that.

886
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And you got interested, of course, in the Chinese early Navy,

887
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and the famous Southern was 11th or 12th century.

888
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The famous Chinese who, I saw his name in Paul's book the other day,

889
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and can't remember his last name, decided, you know,

890
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
gone out on the high seas and came back and scuttled the Navy.

891
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And Bill used that, you know, as a metaphor for no empire,

892
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
which I love.

893
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And he wrote a paper having to do with something to that effect.

894
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And he was going to read it at the Pacific Coast Branch meeting,

895
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:31,000
of the American Historical Association in Honolulu in 1996.

896
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And I was there presenting a paper on another panel,

897
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and Bill something happened to him when he couldn't make the trip.

898
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I'm 19, not in 1996, 86.

899
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And it could have been another meeting in the PCV.

900
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It was about that time, late.

901
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It was 86 or 87, 88, maybe somewhere else.

902
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But anyway, he couldn't make the trip,

903
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and I read his paper.

904
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And I had a lot of fun doing it because there were a couple of people

905
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
on the panel.

906
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
The commenter was a person whose area of expertise was Chinese history.

907
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
There are bills, you know, venturing in this paper,

908
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
talking about Chinese commander and so forth.

909
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And I had to add a bit of humor to it,

910
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
and I told him why Bill couldn't be there.

911
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And I said, I refuse to defend this paper

912
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
because I know nothing about the subjectors,

913
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
like that.

914
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Anyway, but it was received very well,

915
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
including the commenter.

916
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And somebody else made very nice compliments to the paper,

917
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
because no one else in American history

918
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
was thinking in these venues,

919
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
unless they were specialists in Chinese history or anything.

920
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And Bill, you know, had the guts to venture out.

921
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
It's interesting to me to do that.

922
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
He's not this class of the community village.

923
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah.

924
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
He taught it here too.

925
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Yeah.

926
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And then he taught it at the cost community college for a while.

927
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I don't know how successful that was.

928
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Well, of course, it's self-defying to divide.

929
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't know.

930
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
To what extent do you need to reflect on that

931
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
of any philosophy or memories you might have to share?

932
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
No, I know.

933
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
He, the week before he died,

934
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
the cancer had massaged.

935
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And he kind of had a stroke

936
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
because he came walking down the hallway.

937
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You know, he was gesturing to Wendy.

938
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
He couldn't speak or anything.

939
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And within five days, I think he was dead.

940
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And Carl and I went over,

941
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
and some in the hospital,

942
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
but he was, I, David Cleaver,

943
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
it was a famous position in Corvallas,

944
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
was a good friend of Bill's.

945
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And David was there when we were there,

946
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and he explained, you know,

947
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
he said he's semi-comitose or something.

948
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
His eyes could open a little bit,

949
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
but he wasn't corresponding or anything.

950
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And Bill, and he was under more fear than

951
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
he was on the way out.

952
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Wendy, of course, said within hospitals,

953
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
a lot of our life and, you know,

954
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
she knew that the end was near.

955
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I could felt bad.

956
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I know, I told Wendy,

957
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
you know, because I was busy with my own work,

958
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
and, you know,

959
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I enjoyed going over to talk to Bill,

960
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and I would just drive over and have coffee with him,

961
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
or, you know, something like that.

962
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And I felt badly because I hadn't been over for a month.

963
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And she put my soul to rest.

964
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You know, she said that's night of hearing it there.

965
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
What was the local reaction that you noticed?

966
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I was in the memorialized.

967
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Well, this is something I learned.

968
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I, and I learned this from Ed Craple.

969
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I always thought that Bill and Wendy

970
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
went to the Episcopal Church,

971
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
because of Wendy's influence.

972
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And I was totally wrong.

973
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
That was Bill's choice to go to the Episcopal Church.

974
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And he was, I don't know whether he helped with,

975
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
you know, the sacraments or something.

976
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I don't know.

977
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But Wendy went just to accompany him.

978
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Wendy was there.

979
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And is a radical Quaker, her sister,

980
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
her husband Alan, her Wendy's brother, while Alan.

981
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
They're, in the,

982
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
trueest, radical Quaker tradition in England.

983
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And it was Bill, Ed Craple told me this.

984
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So I said to me, Bill is high church, not Wendy.

985
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And he said, yes, are you?

986
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Ed Craple's the guy you should talk to about that.

987
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That was striking to me.

988
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah.

989
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And I think, and I was reading between lines

990
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and what Paul said that his,

991
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
kind of sense for order and maybe hierarchy

992
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
or something later in his life attracted him

993
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
to the Episcopal Church.

994
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And I don't know what his church bringing

995
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
wasn't Episcopal in.

996
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I don't think in Atlantic.

997
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
But I do remember that.

998
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Well, is there anything else that we should touch on?

999
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
No, I have do one have one final thing.

1000
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And Bill's passing is something akin to my mother's passing.

1001
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And she was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 60.

1002
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And right after she retired from as a factory worker.

1003
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And, you know, I had, obviously,

1004
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
an immediate period of grieving.

1005
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
But when I went back east for going through a wake,

1006
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
and my father was Catholic, my mother wasn't,

1007
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
but my father wasn't a practicing Catholic,

1008
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
but he just thought, you know,

1009
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the first people who died need wakes.

1010
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So we had this damn wake.

1011
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And I met my mother's friends from the factory.

1012
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
We were came in by the droves.

1013
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And I never shed a tear.

1014
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And it was nice to meet all these people.

1015
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And Bill's passing is somewhat like my mother's,

1016
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
because my mother has a living presence in my life.

1017
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Bill has a living presence in my life.

1018
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I mean, I remember him as the conversations happened yesterday.

1019
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And that's healthy.

1020
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Thank you, Bill.

1021
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You're welcome.
