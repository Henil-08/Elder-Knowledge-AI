1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is my officialer, and I'm at the home of Gene Starker Roth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today is October 31st, October 31st, 2007, and Gene and I are going to be talking about

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the years when she was raising a family here in Corvallis, her life with Kermit,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that section of her life.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you did a great job in your interview with Wade telling about how you met Kermit.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I don't want to make you repeat that story, but it is a wonderful story about how you

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
came together, but I'd like to know a little bit more.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The questions that he didn't ask you are the kinds of questions that a woman has

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a tendency more to ask in terms of what it was about him that attracted you.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And how you knew he was the right man for you at the very early days there.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, I had been dating a lot of boys out at not only at Kermit, but also in part

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in Australia at the US, and officers clubs up there.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I don't know when I met Kermit, we just hit it off and we the first date that we had

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
after the original date in the effort fraternity has.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We just talked and talked and talked and everything was just, you know, we agreed

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
on a lot of things.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He was an easy person to spend time with.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, that's right.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So I think that that, and of course he was tall and he was good looking.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Lots of people said that he looked just like Gary Cooper.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In fact, when I obtained his picture to put in my apartment in Australia, when I had

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
people come and say, why do you have Gary Cooper's picture in your room?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wow, that's quite a statement.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And also after we were married, sometimes we go to a gas station and the gas station

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
boys would come up and then after they put the gas in several times this happened,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
they would knock on my door and they said, did anybody ever tell you,

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
or has been looks like Gary Cooper?

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, that's quite a compliment.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you dated for about a year before you got married?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, we met in September because that was state fair and PI, which was Pacific International.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That was a big thing with extension and then at Thanksgiving,

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
he planted his paternity pin and at Christmas, we announced our engagement.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And we were married in June.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a pretty quick turnaround.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it was September that you met him.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You must have been pretty sure then he was the right man.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, that's right.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There was never any doubt in my mind.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, we're some of the things that you did together in that for those first six months that helped

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to secure your relationship.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, I think that we spent a lot of time with our families.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think that was very educational because from then on, from the time we met,

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
he would come to Astoria.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I had an apartment in a big old, what do I want to say out?

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was a very old house and the people that I lived with had two little girls.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I think they wanted me to live there because I could occasionally babysit if they wanted to go to a late movie.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They knew I was home and could watch the girls.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But we stuck.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I lost some of the things that you spent the time with your family.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, he would come up and they offered for him to stay in their bedroom, a bedroom adjoining my unit.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then the next weekend we'd go to his mother's house and can be meet there.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then the next weekend we'd come down to Curve Allison.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He was at the fraternity and I was with my parents.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think in those days you didn't live together.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, for you married.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Absolutely not.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we were at one of our, one of those three places every weekend from that time on.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So your parents got to know him pretty quickly.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, yes.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How did they like him?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They thought he was fine.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They didn't like him from the start, huh?

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Never really discussed it.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But I remember very distinctly saying,

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now if you have any, I'm going to marry this man if you got any objections.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Tell me now.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm saying.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, I'm like you had gotten pretty bold over the years.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You've come a long way from.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From those early days.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So he was still going to school at that time.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, because he had started school.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And do you want me to tell you a little bit about his background?

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Absolutely.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, Kermit was raised in Monmouth because his father was a superintendent of schools there.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I guess that Kerval has played Monmouth in football and he played football.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I didn't know a man.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then he, his father wanted to get his doctor to agree.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So Kermit joined the three C.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, he went to school, I think, one term.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And then his dad didn't have enough money to go and get a doctorate.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So Kermit joined the three Cs.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And he sent his money home from that.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So his dad could get his doctorate.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And then was right after high school?

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then his father did get his doctorate.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And they, but it was during the war by then.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And he was asked to go to Portland to teach.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, there's, how to, how to not only, well, no.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's, that's right.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He was asked to teach.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, there's how to teach.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, there's.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because they a lot of them knew how to well.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But they couldn't teach people how to well.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So he, he was employed to do that.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
To teach.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then Kermit went in the service.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And his father died while he was overseas.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So the Red Cross flew him home.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I didn't know him at this point in life.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then his mother had always taught school.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And she moved to can be and bought a house.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it was a four or five bedroom house.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And she took in teachers because she was so lonely.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And that developed when we were married.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then she died when we had to get a house.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We had to buy a house that fit our furniture.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Because she had all these beds and mattresses.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, that's human heritage.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So we, we inherited all her furniture.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I couldn't start at the rooming house yourself.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But we, the bedding and all of that was so good to, you know, just give away.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So we tried to keep it.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And of course eventually we used it with all our kids.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's a good thing.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So what was, where was Kermit in the war?

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He was, he was tinny in, which is a little island about a mile by a mile and a half.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Very close to,

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, I'll have to think about that.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll have to get you the name of that.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But you know, if you heard it, it was very much in the news.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it was a small island.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And, but they, there were japs on it.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And they never knew when they were going to run into somebody who was hiding in that island.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Uh-huh.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But that was when he learned to a scuba dive because he was a mechanic repairing airplanes that had been shot down.

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And so he took the plexiglass and made a mask and took the rubber off the tires.

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And it blown and made the back of the mask.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And he made quite a little money during that period because he would dive for shells.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, interesting.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I had, I don't know, how many shoe boxes of shells would, when we were married.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He brought those with him.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So he took advantage of being in a tropical location.

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, he did.

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And he always blessed the government for sending him to a warm climate because he said that he never would have survived in Europe with a cold.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, I did.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He did like to be cold.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So he was with the air force.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But he didn't fly.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He was always in the canning.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, he intended to fly.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But the time he got through is schooling.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They didn't need pilots anymore.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And he had, of course, a very, he was a very handy man.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And he knew how to fix anything.

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So they put him in a good job for him.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That sounds good.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But he did have to do some combat.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No, not really.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was never a shooting person.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He just worked on the airplanes.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But when they walked around the island, they were exposed to japs sometimes.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I know he said that he got some holes to hide in.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If they were around.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But he wasn't in a situation where he was particularly traumatized.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When he came back, he was in pretty good shape.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, he was in pretty good shape.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But he told me that when he came back and, of course, he'd lost his dad.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so his mother wanted a lot of things done around the house.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And he said he didn't go out at all.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He just wanted to stay home.

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So he did a lot of repair work around the house that you wanted done for.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think it was over six months that he just didn't do anything.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, he needed to make a transition.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And then when he came back to school,

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he was ready to get on with his life.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And he, his goal when he came back to school was to get a Tomlinson commission.

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it must be a thing of the past because I asked some military men not long ago

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
if they knew what a Tomlinson commission was.

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And they didn't know anything about it.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But as I understood it at the time, it was a commission given to people

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with proper qualifications that would give them a permanent place in the military,

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
not a reserve commission, which most of the kids who go through ROTC receive.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So that was quite an honor to get that.

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then we were going to be married in June.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And he received the Tomlinson commission just in very short time.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Maybe maybe the middle of May.

189
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Before we were to be married.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And he said, he never consulted me.

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But he just said, I just figured you wouldn't make a very good military wife.

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I turned it down.

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's interesting.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Now, why do you think he thought that was it the moving around part that he thought you would see?

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think so.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I also think that he blamed it on me a little bit.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I think that the time he decided to get married that he wanted to be settled down.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He didn't want to travel.

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So I think it was a little bit of a...

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's a hard life for early that.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, it is.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So what was his major in college?

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In industrial engineering.

205
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Industrial engineering.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Interesting.

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I didn't realize that.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And he worked for a high-stir company.

209
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The first year or so we moved after we went on our honeymoon.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, I don't know whether I covered this with weight or not.

211
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We were...he was commissioned in the morning.

212
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And he got the Tomons of Commission.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
At noon, he was graduated from Oregon State.

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And it was a hundred and seven degree in courvelles.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
At that time, they graduated from the men's gym, which is now something else.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And they had ice.

217
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Big 50,000 bucks of ice in all the windows.

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
To try and cool things.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I remember looking at his collar.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He had perspired clear through all his collar.

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And then we were married in the evening.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh my god.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That was a big day.

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Was.

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Had you planned it that way?

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Did you know the situation was going to happen with things?

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, that sounds like a stressful, stressful way to do things.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But after the honeymoon, why were we?

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And that was also a little crisis because we had the vanport flood at that moment.

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Tell me what it is.

232
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So we were going to up to quit late-quenalt.

233
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We had to get up to Washington.

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so Kermit said, well, we were going to spend the first night in Salem.

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because we didn't want to drive very far.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And after the wedding and all the day we'd had.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And there was a thunderstorm that night because of the heat.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And when we drove up the highway, there were power lines coming down and

240
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
flopping on the highway.

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I thought, oh, we're going to get electrocuted before we forever have a honeymoon.

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But we did.

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We made it to Salem.

244
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then we knew that the bridges in part were all closed.

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So the only way to get north was through long view are bridge of the gods.

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And so he said, which do you want to do?

247
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I said, well, we're off on a holiday.

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's just go to the bridge of the gods.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've never been across the bridge of the gods.

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And he said, OK, so we went up there.

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And we came around and we got as far as.

252
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Some place in Washington.

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't remember the name.

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The river is close to there.

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It was something K.

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I could look on a map and find it.

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But anyway, we got that far.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the town was underwater.

259
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So then we had to turn around.

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Go back over the bridge of the gods down to long view and then across.

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wow.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And we called that wet flood.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The then port flood.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that was a big nature.

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was where a lot of people lived during the war.

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It was kind of low income housing.

267
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it all flooded.

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And you're never heard of that.

269
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm embarrassed to say that.

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, it's very, very well known.

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like a lot of people.

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Uh-huh.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So the section of Portland.

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It was out by Jensen Beach.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Uh-huh.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, look that up and read about a little bit.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So anyway, you were going to tell me a little bit about your wedding.

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, yes.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It was at the Presbyterian territory.

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Sure.

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's correct.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
At first, I said to my parents that I don't want to be married in the Presbyterian church

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because at that time it's been remodeled since it was pretty Barney.

285
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And that cold I felt.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I just didn't want to be married there.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, we got to looking at the wedding list.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And of course, Kermit's family was from Modemuth.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And my family had lived here forever.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And the guest list was getting so big that that was about the only place that we could

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
have the wedding.

292
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So bless my father.

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He decided that he could fix it.

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So that morning he and I don't know who else.

295
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I wasn't aware of it all going on.

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But somebody helped him and they brought in about 50 fur trees.

297
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There were a lot of them.

298
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And they put it all around the front of the church.

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean, and it was so hot that it was in June when the new growth was on the fur trees.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And so they wilted and it looked like a little ornament on each limb of the trees.

301
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was just beautiful.

302
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And this was on the inside of the church.

303
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

304
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They brought them all in and put them up.

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And the church side the church.

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And as I say, all the fur trees because it was so hot, they just wilted.

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And all those little new growth on it just hung down.

308
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And they looked like a little ornament.

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It was just really quite effective.

310
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then we had white.

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
One of those white flowers that you take to San Beteries in June.

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
From Memorial Day.

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
For San Fums.

314
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Not for San Fums.

315
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Not for San Fums.

316
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know either.

317
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But I can look it up.

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

319
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Almost need you to do that.

320
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But then we both.

321
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, I may be able to think of it before we get through.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But anyway, it was really pretty all white.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And then the shades of green.

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, yeah.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was really quite lovely.

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
People were quite impressed by it.

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

328
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And so perfect for your family.

329
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes.

330
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It was.

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a nice pigment.

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So tell me about your dress.

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Was it something that?

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, I made my dress.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You know, in those days, there were the bridal

336
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
stores that there are now.

337
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I wanted to wear my mother's wedding dress.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But it was too small.

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My mother was a very petite lady when she was married.

340
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But she had a lot of lace on her dress and also on the veil.

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I took the lace and put some sheer yolk on my dress.

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And that the lace was from her wedding dress.

343
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So it was quite a sentimental affair.

344
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, yeah.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But I made it because I, you know, was a homey condom.

346
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It was a nice sewed and there were patterns and sewing books to use.

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it worked out just fine.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then the, I, her veil had been kind of eaten.

349
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You know, through the years with different, I suppose,

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
pause or something.

351
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And anyway, I use the, all the lace from her veil around the edge of my veil.

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I thought that was quite nice.

354
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, but some very touching.

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Was it a large group?

356
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Was it your family or were there friends and community members too?

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, there weren't too many because there was my father's sister and her husband.

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And then my, my grandmother was my father's mother was alive at that time.

359
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And her wish was that she lived to see me married.

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And she got her wish. She came in a wheelchair.

361
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And, and she, she couldn't see very well.

362
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But we had a nice conversation.

363
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And, during our honeymoon, she died.

364
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And so we had to come home from our honeymoon to go to her funeral.

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Wonderful that she got her wish.

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

367
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So, you know, there's so much planning and such that goes into weddings these days.

368
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It seems like it's just a huge endeavor.

369
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Did you have a big build-up to it?

370
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean, we...

371
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Well, no, I think in those days, it wasn't a three day affair like it is now.

372
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
No, we just, well, as I say, we were pretty busy all day.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But we just had the wedding and then reception.

374
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And people didn't stay long at that reception.

375
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It was too hot.

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But we had cake.

377
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think we just had cake and punch.

378
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Uh-huh.

379
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There at the church.

380
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Uh-huh.

381
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, that sounds just right because then you could get out and get on your way.

382
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

383
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So, you know, now they do a breakfast after the wedding and all that stuff.

384
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And dinner beforehand.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, yeah.

386
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, no.

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
My daughter went to a wedding not so long ago.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It was in a while.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
They had a big groom's dinner.

390
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I...

391
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, my folks did a groom's dinner the night before.

392
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Uh-huh.

393
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And we had a lot of the fraternity boys and some of the family.

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But they were only just those few people.

395
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't think my grandmother came to that because she was too frail.

396
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But we did have... and they gave it because her mother was in... she lived in Canby.

397
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Mm-hmm.

398
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So, it wasn't convenient for her to do it.

399
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And in those days, we didn't go to restaurants.

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It was all done in your home.

401
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Sure.

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Uh-huh.

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So, you know, we only had just one or two restaurants in Corvalle.

404
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Uh-huh.

405
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Custards in and out.

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The gables.

407
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That was about it.

408
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It was an original.

409
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Mm-hmm.

410
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Interesting.

411
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Has... have any of... did either of your daughters use your dress as a wedding dress?

412
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No.

413
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No.

414
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They never did.

415
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They wanted their own.

416
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Uh-huh.

417
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you still have that dress?

418
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes, I do.

419
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I... I hope I'll have a picture of you and your dress in this.

420
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It won't fit now.

421
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't do it.

422
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't mean a girl.

423
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know.

424
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But I... but I do have a picture.

425
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

426
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Good.

427
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Wonderful.

428
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ah.

429
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So, you went off and did your honeymoon and then um... he ended up in a first job in Portland

430
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and how did he get that job with Heister?

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, I think through the college and those days we... they had placement people.

432
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh, I know I was placed in a job by a placement person on the campus.

433
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Uh-huh.

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Uh-huh.

435
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I presume that's how he got his job and he worked for Heister for...

436
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Uh...

437
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We lived there.

438
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We lived in an apartment.

439
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
A very small apartment for a few months.

440
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Permits mothers wanted to do three things before she died.

441
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And I'll try to remember what they were.

442
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Uh-huh.

443
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
She wanted to go down to see her other son Norman who was lived in California.

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
She wanted to fly in an airplane.

445
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Uh-huh.

446
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That was the third thing she wanted to do.

447
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, she did all three anyway, whatever they were.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That might come to you too.

449
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And so she said, why don't you and Kermit live in my house while I go do these things?

450
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And because she spent probably a month maybe more down in California.

451
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And she had a garden.

452
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
She was a great gardener.

453
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And of course, can be soil is wonderful for gardens.

454
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And so we stayed at the house and took care of the garden.

455
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And I did a lot of canning for her and got things, you know, made use of what was in the garden.

456
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then she came home.

457
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I had an offer.

458
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think maybe I told Wade this.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I had an offer to go down to the dals.

460
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And do a, sometimes I have trouble with getting the right words out.

461
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I was judging her fair.

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I said to her, wouldn't you like to go with me and be a nice trip for you.

463
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I'm just going for the day.

464
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And she said, oh, she'd love to.

465
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, she went with me.

466
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I judged pillow slips among them.

467
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The broader pillow slips among many other things.

468
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I gave first prize to the white embroidered pillow slips.

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because a lot of the women had done magic colored ones.

470
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And they were pretty bad.

471
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Excuse me.

472
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Hello.

473
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes.

474
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes, Rebecca.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How are you this month?

476
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

477
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I have a lady sitting here now that's doing an interview with me.

478
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So I really can't talk.

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh, good.

480
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Good.

481
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, now, when are you in a week from Friday?

482
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay.

483
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, would you put a little tickler on your counter to call me when you get home?

484
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But I can come down and talk with you.

485
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

486
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Thanks.

487
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, we had a good time.

488
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Didn't we?

489
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I did.

490
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay.

491
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Bye.

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Bye.

493
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Sorry.

494
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's great.

495
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All right.

496
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You gave the prize to the white pillow slips.

497
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes.

498
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So anyway, there was quite some discussion, apparently, about this judge who was doing this.

499
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And she sat in the corner and listened to her new daughter-in-law, you know, being criticized.

500
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
She could hardly wait to get in the car and tell me that these women had said.

501
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And she was just laughing.

502
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And she just thought that was a fun example.

503
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They think it could get that excited about their real police.

504
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
She had quite a sense of humor.

505
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We got along just great.

506
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, the shame that you didn't get to spend more time with her.

507
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes.

508
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then I suppose we better put in something about how she died because it wasn't more than a couple

509
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
of months.

510
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I forgot when she died.

511
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But she didn't last more than a couple months after she came home.

512
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And we got a call when we were in Portland.

513
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We had moved from the house where we lived.

514
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Well, she was away.

515
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And we got in a department in Portland.

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We lived where the safe way is now in Lloyd-Sitter.

517
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And we got a call one morning about five, third year, six.

518
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And the land ladies, you know, telephones were hard to get right after the war.

519
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And she had no telephone in her house.

520
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And we had no telephone in our house in our apartment.

521
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But the land lady called and she tapped on her door.

522
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And she said, your mother is had a heart attack and you need to go.

523
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And so we just dressed and left.

524
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And we got there.

525
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
She had the heart attack and got up and tried to make it over to the neighbors.

526
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But had fallen in her garden.

527
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And the neighbors had found her early in the morning, fortunately.

528
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And so they got her back into the house and in bed.

529
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And of course we got there and called the doctor.

530
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And you know what we know about heart now is just, it's just like night and day.

531
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Because we didn't know the minutes where seconds were important at that time.

532
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And the doctors at that era in that era made house calls.

533
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So the doctor came to the house.

534
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And of course by that time, you know, she was, had quite a lot of problems.

535
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Well, she lasted about two or three days.

536
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I remember Kermit went back to our apartment to clean out the refrigerator and get things squared away.

537
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Because we just left and bring some clothes for us to wear.

538
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And so when he was gone to Portland to get those things taken care of, she had another attack.

539
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then I was feeding her some applesauce because I had made some from her own apples.

540
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And she said, oh, that smells so good.

541
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I would just like to have a taste.

542
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And so I said, well, fine, I'll fix you some.

543
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I was feeding her and all of a sudden she just just died.

544
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And so Kermit came home about the time that that happened.

545
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And he immediately called the doctor.

546
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And he said, well, she's gone.

547
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hello.

548
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Hi there.

549
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
How are you?

550
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Good.

551
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But I'm with a lady here that I need to, she's doing an interview with me.

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I don't have much time to talk, unfortunately.

553
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Where are you now?

554
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay.

555
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, I'll call you tonight.

556
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I mailed the package to Micah today about the coat.

557
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, so he'll get it in a couple of days.

558
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Good.

559
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, I said, I took all the things off of the batches.

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And then I sent it to the cleaners.

561
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So it's already to go.

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
All right.

563
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Well, I'll try and call you.

564
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, it went from five o'clock work.

565
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

566
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll give you a call.

567
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay.

568
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That was my grandson.

570
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Wait, all right.

571
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So you were saying that Permock got there just as she passed away.

572
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yes.

573
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes.

574
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And I didn't know anything about death.

575
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And he held her tongue down.

576
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And you know, it was pretty awful.

577
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So then we had to call his brother in California.

578
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They came up and then we divided all the stuff.

579
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And that's how we got all the furniture.

580
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because they didn't want the furniture.

581
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They'd been married for a number of years.

582
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And he was the oldest brother in Kermit was the youngest.

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So he said, you just take all the furniture.

584
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So that's what we did.

585
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So do you think you said she had some a few wishes of things she wanted to do before you.

586
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
She died.

587
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
She had a sense that that she would.

588
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think she knew that.

589
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I really think that Kermit sense that he was not going to live very long.

590
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Really.

591
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because he was so always so insisted that I know everything about our business.

592
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And both his parents had died of her daughter.

593
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, heart attack.

594
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
His father fell off of.

595
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He was milking a cow and fell off the stool and died.

596
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So, you know, he had bad genes.

597
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, that's true.

598
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That means a lot.

599
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But she was a delightful person while you knew her.

600
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And did Kermit have that same fun sense if you were a she had?

601
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't think it was quite as broad as her sense of humor.

602
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But she got a big kick out of life.

603
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So it was nice to know her briefly.

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah.

605
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So there you were in the big city of Portland.

606
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Was it a pretty happening town at the time?

607
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, yes.

608
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I think that I really enjoyed Portland.

609
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I didn't want to move back to Kermit when we finally made that decision.

610
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But Kermit thought it was the thing to do.

611
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We had two children by then.

612
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And he thought it was the thing to do.

613
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And my dad was putting a lot of pressure on him to come back and start a plywood plant.

614
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh.

615
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And Kermit had the industrial engineering training.

616
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And so there were 10 men who put their money together and built the plywood plant.

617
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And Kermit designed it and was in charge of it.

618
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He was because the rest of them in all had other jobs.

619
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So he did that for three or four years.

620
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't remember just how long.

621
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But then the plywood market went kapoot.

622
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And so they sold it to somebody, can't remember.

623
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So then he Kermit went into partnership with a man Gordon Larson.

624
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And that's, you know, Beverly Larson who runs the Oelville school.

625
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, it was her father that was in partnership with Kermit.

626
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And my dad was sort of putting up the money for this.

627
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Well, Gordon had had a meal out.

628
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, that's a lie in Pheloma.

629
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He was on the wall port side.

630
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't know.

631
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Just, it wasn't very far up that road.

632
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He had always had a song now.

633
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And so.

634
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But they decided they built it down here at 53rd and reservoir road.

635
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And so a Kermit designed that meal.

636
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And then they built it.

637
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And ran it for.

638
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I would say maybe eight or nine years.

639
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And then.

640
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They had a.

641
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I wouldn't say a.

642
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, they disagreed on just a little bit about how it should be run.

643
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And so Kermit said he'd like to buy him out.

644
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Gordon didn't have the money to buy him out.

645
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And so.

646
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Kermit did buy the meal out.

647
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And then Gordon died.

648
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Probably.

649
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Maybe six months after that.

650
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That was all settled.

651
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because of course they had to divide up all the timber land and everything.

652
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
They had property.

653
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Uh-huh.

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They bought a lot of timber land in order to have timber in the winter time.

655
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
When they couldn't log.

656
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Other places.

657
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They bought timber land.

658
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It could be logged in this in the winter time.

659
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So.

660
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That was.

661
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Very fortunate that we got all that done before.

662
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He died.

663
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yes.

664
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That would have been a mess.

665
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
He died of a heart attack to us.

666
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I remember it.

667
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You could check them.

668
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
With them about that.

669
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But I think that he did.

670
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So that mills not there anymore is it?

671
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
No.

672
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It isn't.

673
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's.

674
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's where they started to run shave.

675
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah.

676
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I know there's a little.

677
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Again.

678
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They couldn't do it because it was annexed.

679
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh.

680
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah.

681
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I ran the property for a number of years after my husband died.

682
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I rented it out to various people who ran the mail.

683
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then timber prices weren't very good.

684
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And the last people that owned it.

685
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It was just ready to not be brought anymore.

686
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And so.

687
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
One day they were putting in the water.

688
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Pipe down reservoir road.

689
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And then it came into the fairgrounds.

690
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And they wanted some place to dump the dirt.

691
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And so I said, well, dump it in the pond.

692
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Because I just assume fill in those ponds.

693
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Well, it seemed as though that was not the thing to do.

694
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because there are rules about filling ponds.

695
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I found out.

696
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, one day I spent, I don't know how long on the telephone.

697
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I was all one afternoon and into the next day talking to governmental agencies.

698
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And finally, I got a hold of some.

699
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't remember which one.

700
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But they said, oh, Mrs. Roth, we don't talk to owners.

701
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We just talked to lawyers.

702
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And that was the living end.

703
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I just decided I wasn't going to have anything to do with that.

704
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So my, I was mupent to my son about it.

705
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And he said, Mom, you should now that stress.

706
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So he said, I'll take over running it.

707
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So anyway, he tried to run it for, I don't know, four or five years.

708
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And he was in California.

709
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And it was just too much.

710
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So he finally sold it.

711
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And that's when they started to run the goats.

712
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And then they found out they couldn't run the goats because it was in,

713
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
he had annexed it.

714
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Uh-huh.

715
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And, uh, so now it's in the city, within the city limits.

716
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So they couldn't.

717
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

718
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's in the city.

719
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

720
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's interesting.

721
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And it's very odd because soon after,

722
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Ken got through, sold it.

723
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It now, they, you know, they put in all that lovely area in front of the

724
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Fairgrounds.

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And they've got the dirt over ready.

726
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And they're going to run the street.

727
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Uh, 53rd's going to go up over the railroad.

728
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And they're going to do that right away.

729
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh, I didn't realize that.

730
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Huh?

731
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's interesting.

732
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's not bad at the city.

733
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

734
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah.

735
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
One thing after another.

736
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

737
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So he, so permanent was, as long as we're talking about his career.

738
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I can ask you the rest of my questions about, about his career.

739
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So he then stayed at that mill.

740
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Till.

741
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I know this.

742
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He wanted himself in 67 then.

743
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And then did he stay with the mill?

744
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
All the rest of his life.

745
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

746
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah.

747
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So he shut it down after he had run it 12 years.

748
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And we didn't do anything with it.

749
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I guess he, I can't remember whether he rented it to anybody or not.

750
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But he played the stock market.

751
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He was very sharp about it.

752
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
He would get up in the morning and look at all the listings in the paper.

753
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And he made a lot of money on the stock market because he just had a feel for it.

754
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
One time we bought Fuji photo stock.

755
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And we made a lot of money on that.

756
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Because it was just when it was starting to come into the United States.

757
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So he said, I think we should take a trip.

758
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I said, well, we made our money on Fuji photo.

759
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I think we should go to Japan.

760
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And so we did.

761
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And that was real fun.

762
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We had a lovely, lovely trip.

763
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So was that when you had all four children.

764
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Did you take children with you on that trip?

765
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes.

766
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You did.

767
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Wow.

768
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I guess we can skip to that.

769
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I want to get back to a couple more questions about his progression through his career too.

770
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But I'd love to hear about the Japan trips since we're there.

771
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Well, we got a lady to stay with in the meantime.

772
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
My mother had passed away.

773
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And we got a lady to stay with the children.

774
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But she had to also feed my father because he, after my mother died,

775
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the course that day, why I said, both stay for dinner.

776
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And he just kept coming and kept coming.

777
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That lasted 15 years.

778
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
He had a regular dinner invitation.

779
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yes.

780
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I didn't have an invitation, but he had a seat at the table.

781
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Uh-huh.

782
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And that first he lived just through the woods,

783
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
between Jackson and Van Buren.

784
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But then later he moved out on to Timion,

785
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
addition out on 53rd Street.

786
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then by that time, Kim was learning to drive.

787
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And so she could go out and get him and bring him in.

788
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Because he wasn't driving by that time.

789
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

790
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So he just always came.

791
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's a nice thing.

792
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's good.

793
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So you had a woman who stayed in the house.

794
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And she had to feed him too.

795
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Care of things there.

796
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then the rest of you packed off to Asia.

797
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's been a very extravagant trip at that time.

798
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh, it was.

799
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It was.

800
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Well, we've we've stopped over in.

801
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Uh-huh.

802
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And then we had a couple of days there.

803
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And then we went to Japan.

804
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then on the way back, we stopped at Bora Bora.

805
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Wow.

806
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
How long was the trip altogether?

807
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I think we were going three weeks.

808
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Wow.

809
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That was a pretty long trip.

810
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yes.

811
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And that was, was it your first time out of the country, right?

812
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, we've been to Hawaii a couple of times.

813
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So you've done some flying.

814
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yes.

815
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Because we took the all the family to Hawaii a couple of times.

816
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So was it was current more of a traveler?

817
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Since he'd done his stint there.

818
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
He really enjoyed the trip to Japan.

819
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
He just thought he didn't have any desire to go to Europe at all.

820
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think he'd heard too many tales during the war of the hardships in Europe with the military.

821
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And so, but he really, I don't know why, but he just thought that Japan was great.

822
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Interesting.

823
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And it's.

824
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So having been in the second world war and over in that part of the world war, was it hard for him to embrace the Japanese?

825
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Did he feel any prejudices?

826
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
No, it seemed to be.

827
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
He didn't seem to have any feelings about the Japanese.

828
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
We were there during.

829
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What do they call that when we have the world?

830
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It was a.

831
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The world's fair.

832
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
World's fair.

833
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's what it was.

834
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And of course, we were so tall that the Japanese we.

835
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We'd hold our hands out like this and the Japanese would get under our arms and then they

836
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
They want their pictures taken.

837
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We were so tall.

838
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

839
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And what an express for your children.

840
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
To be able to see that.

841
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Well, they showed.

842
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We've showed them the pictures, of course, when we got home, but they didn't.

843
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But so the children didn't go.

844
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
No, no, it was just a no.

845
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The babysitter stayed and took care of them.

846
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I don't care of everybody.

847
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I see.

848
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think.

849
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Well, I want to ask you some more about some of your.

850
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm going to try to travel.

851
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But so we don't get too off course here.

852
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm going to take us back to where we were when you were talking.

853
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I just wanted to finish up learning a little bit about Kermit's career because you.

854
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
You've been talking about that.

855
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And what I wondered was when it was that he started getting involved in in property management,

856
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
how we how we move from being an industrial engineer to.

857
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes.

858
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The lumber business.

859
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yes.

860
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's quite a transition there.

861
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yes.

862
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It was.

863
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Well, I told you that my mother had died.

864
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
There.

865
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And I had inherited the by-mark property through the.

866
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
My mother's part when she died.

867
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And so my dad had given me that property.

868
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
In exchange for.

869
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Some property that he had.

870
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And that's.

871
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
10 21.

872
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Real estate exchange.

873
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And that's how that came about.

874
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I did that.

875
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And that's probably he's more known for.

876
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That in the United States and not for.

877
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Then for his forestry.

878
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Are you familiar with that?

879
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, when I first started looking researching your family a little bit before I started.

880
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I looked and I did find that that many references on the internet to.

881
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
To TJ Starker have to do with that real estate.

882
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah.

883
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That was.

884
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Decided and then has been sort of the standard then from then on.

885
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes.

886
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah.

887
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And so we had.

888
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
We inherited that.

889
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And then we bought.

890
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Several when he was working with the stock market.

891
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
We bought several pieces of property.

892
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And.

893
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
In turn.

894
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Did some.

895
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
10 31 exchanges with that.

896
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And we always traded up.

897
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And so we just.

898
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You know, that was our income was because we didn't have anything.

899
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
We we had to have some flow.

900
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But when Kermit died.

901
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
There was not much.

902
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Property that was giving me any.

903
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Real secure monthly.

904
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, money flow.

905
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And so that's when when I started doing the.

906
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Real estate because I traded that some of the timber land that was left over from.

907
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
From the mail.

908
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Mm hmm.

909
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I've traded that for real estate.

910
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Mm hmm.

911
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And that.

912
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I would really like to.

913
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And I have some emphasis put on that because.

914
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
When my father died, he left me.

915
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think.

916
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Mm hmm.

917
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
In fact, on in his well, it says to my daughter, Jane, I leave.

918
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I think.

919
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
His.

920
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
His whole.

921
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Point in establishing his.

922
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Timmer.

923
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Was to create a.

924
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
A starker for us.

925
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What would you say?

926
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Like a theater.

927
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yes.

928
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That was.

929
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And he didn't want it broken up.

930
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Mm hmm.

931
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So he didn't.

932
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And everybody thinks I got some money from him and that's how I got started.

933
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But that's not the way it was.

934
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He wanted all that to be kept within the structure of the business.

935
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's right.

936
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Interesting.

937
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Hmm.

938
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And you know, I could be better.

939
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
But.

940
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's.

941
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I don't know what I did with that piece of paper.

942
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I have two things that I think I'd like to put in this.

943
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Uh.

944
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Because that's what I live by.

945
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And I wrote that out.

946
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Well, although when I go out to the kitchen before you leave and see.

947
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Because I wrote those things down.

948
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
One is something about it's worded better than I can't word it.

949
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But it's something about if you have an asset in a container.

950
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's sometimes eats at the container that it's in.

951
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And uh, yeah, there's another one about there.

952
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And I think that's very true.

953
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I could be really bitter.

954
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yes.

955
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I could be very upset with my grandmothers, my nephews.

956
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They had nothing to do with it.

957
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Right.

958
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It was all my dad's.

959
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Object to.

960
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Leave that as a unit.

961
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Hmm.

962
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And he didn't want.

963
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And he didn't really appreciate women either, you know.

964
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah.

965
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
He didn't like the fact that women were in the forestry school.

966
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Hmm.

967
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And he didn't really like my sister-in-law.

968
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Got interested in the, in the timber business.

969
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And he really didn't like that either.

970
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Hmm.

971
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
He just, he was a German.

972
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Hmm.

973
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

974
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Very traditional.

975
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Hmm.

976
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The oldest son.

977
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Yep.

978
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yeah.

979
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That's, like you can say, that's a longstanding tradition of patriarchy.

980
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah.

981
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
That's right.

982
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Yeah.

983
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hmm.

984
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Well, you did very well.

985
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah.

986
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yeah.

987
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Probably by German's hard work in the stock market and buying things at the right time

988
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and anything.

989
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Right.

990
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And does the Roth property services business still exist?

991
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yes.

992
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That's what I do.

993
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I do three times a week.

994
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I work at that.

995
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I have a bookkeeper that comes and keeps track of things.

996
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I manage the properties.

997
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Hmm.

998
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So how did you learn how to do all that real estate business?

999
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't know.

1000
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I think it was by Osmosis from learning from hearing my dad speak about it.

1001
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I think I just absorbed the way it was supposed to be done.

1002
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Hmm.

1003
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And because of course, his talk at the dinner table was always about business.

1004
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah.

1005
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I think I must have just sort of absorbed it.

1006
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Hmm.

1007
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Did you increment work together in the early years when you were part of it?

1008
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Absolutely.

1009
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah.

1010
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Absolutely.

1011
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We did.

1012
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I remember one time we owned up that property down.

1013
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's a corner of it's where that painting pottery painting places.

1014
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And we owned that building at one time.

1015
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And the real estate man, I remember this so vividly.

1016
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He called up and he said, did we want to sell it?

1017
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And permit put down the phone and he said, do we want to sell that?

1018
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Because there was a lot of agitation at the time that they were going to change downtown.

1019
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And the Madison Avenue Task Force was in starting and they were going to do big things.

1020
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And of course the guy that's chairman of the Madison Avenue Task Force is a very good friend of ours and still friend.

1021
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But I didn't always agree with what they were doing.

1022
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And so I said to him, you know, I think we're going to be charged a lot for doing makeover there.

1023
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And I said, one of they want to give us for it.

1024
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And so the realtor said, well, what do you take for it?

1025
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And we don't he held it a year or so.

1026
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And I said, well, 50,000 more than we want to pay for it.

1027
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And he said that my buyers will take it.

1028
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So we're 10 minute conversation.

1029
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I thought that that was a pretty good way to make 50,000 bucks.

1030
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, so the two of you were sort of a business team.

1031
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes, we were and we always kind of saw an eye on how we did it.

1032
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So forth we never had any any discussions we just talked about it.

1033
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That was it.

1034
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Go on from there.

1035
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So did he ever regret leaving me off being in an industrial engineer?

1036
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
No, I don't think so.

1037
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
No, I think it was very much.

1038
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I think he really enjoyed the business aspect of it.

1039
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I think so.

1040
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Sounds like he was a natural at that.

1041
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

1042
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

1043
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So you had your first two children there in Portland?

1044
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yes.

1045
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And then we moved down here.

1046
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And we had a house down on 10th.

1047
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And Adams.

1048
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Right by the railroad.

1049
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Pacific fruit.

1050
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You remember that?

1051
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, but we're good.

1052
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, well, it's right there.

1053
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And we bought the house because it had enough bedrooms for us to put the furniture.

1054
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And my dad was developing Cedarhurst, which is the corner of 35th.

1055
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And Harrison.

1056
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And he had, I think it's 32 acres in there.

1057
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And he developed that with a division of Ben Buren and Jackson.

1058
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And he gave us a hunk of property down on Jackson Street.

1059
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Because he'd given my brother a piece of that area between Ben Buren and Jackson.

1060
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But clear at the end of where the dairy barns were.

1061
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And of course they lived at the last house out on Harrison.

1062
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
They built that when I was in high school.

1063
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So that's where we lived.

1064
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Well, after we moved back to Kermalus.

1065
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So he gave Kermalus an eye this piece of the end of Jackson.

1066
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And Kermal just took a year off and built that house.

1067
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And he built it with the help of one carpenter.

1068
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I think he only sub-contracted.

1069
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
He did the wiring.

1070
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So he sub-contracted the heating and the water.

1071
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It seems to me there was something else.

1072
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But he did all the rest of it himself because he was capable of doing that.

1073
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And I back-prime all that siding.

1074
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I would go out there after the children got up from their naps and they afternoon.

1075
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I'd go out and they'd play in the yard.

1076
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I was painting.

1077
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So we did it together, but mostly Kermalus.

1078
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Ah.

1079
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
That's impressive.

1080
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Is that house still standing?

1081
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes.

1082
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The times lived there.

1083
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh yeah.

1084
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yes.

1085
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
In fact, it was written up in the paper recently.

1086
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes.

1087
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I remember seeing your name in that article.

1088
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And how long did you live in that house then?

1089
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We lived there 35 years.

1090
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So all the way through your childhood.

1091
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I was a person he died from that house.

1092
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And I lived there six years after he died.

1093
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But you know, it was a seven bedroom house.

1094
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And it was a little big for one lady.

1095
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And so when my last one married,

1096
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I knew she wanted to be married from that house.

1097
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
She's a very sentimental girl.

1098
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
So as soon as she was married, then I got boy,

1099
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
it's time to take care of Jean.

1100
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And so I then built this house.

1101
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I built her, I killed her, built this house.

1102
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But Kathy, in the meantime, had gotten our architectural degree.

1103
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And so she designed the house pretty much for me.

1104
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then, killed her, built it.

1105
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Wonderful.

1106
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And so I really supervised all the building of this house.

1107
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you like building?

1108
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yes, I do.

1109
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then later I built the house at Newport.

1110
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So I built two houses.

1111
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That's impressive.

1112
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I helped.

1113
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
My husband and I built our house.

1114
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And I always think I would never do that again.

1115
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But some people really enjoyed it.

1116
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh, I did.

1117
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I just thoroughly enjoyed it.

1118
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah.

1119
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So many decisions to make.

1120
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Oh, yeah.

1121
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But I loved it.

1122
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I thought it was great.

1123
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Wonderful.

1124
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Good.

1125
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So I'm trying to envision your life here in Corvals, with four children all,

1126
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
pretty close to the same ages.

1127
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Well, they were actually 10 years apart because the first three,

1128
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
two years apart, then we waited four years and then had the next one.

1129
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But still you had your hands fall.

1130
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yes, yes, I did.

1131
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I was busy with the children.

1132
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I do stop working before you had children.

1133
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes, I did.

1134
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But I did a lot of not only volunteering, but I did some teaching at the high school with what

1135
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
do they call that?

1136
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, it's where you teach certain courses to adults.

1137
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I don't know what they call that now.

1138
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It used to be nice school.

1139
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Yeah.

1140
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Something like that.

1141
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But now it does have a no name you're right.

1142
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah, and I don't know what that is.

1143
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But I taught penultimate jackets were very popular.

1144
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And so I taught a class on penultimate jackets.

1145
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So I taught them.

1146
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, penultimate jackets had a lot of the principles of solely, you know,

1147
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the pockets, but it wasn't really complicated.

1148
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Really.

1149
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But it had a lot of principles of solely.

1150
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And so I found that very much fun to teach people the basics.

1151
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah.

1152
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So what kind of things did your,

1153
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
do your family do?

1154
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Were you able to do some things as a group with all six of you?

1155
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Or was that really too many kids to take a little trips with and things like that?

1156
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Oh, no, we used to take the kids fishing every Sunday out of courts,

1157
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:00,000
and then Bruce and Betty had a pond out of, well, it was up towards,

1158
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
or was that out?

1159
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
We went out to the lie and turned towards wall port and wouldn't be called that.

1160
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And how are we 34?

1161
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah.

1162
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And they had some timber land out there that they had a pond on.

1163
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And there was a group of us that were quite,

1164
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
it was the Jim Howellens, the R.T. Rice's, the bud crawls,

1165
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and that was, well, I guess that was at Bruce and Betty,

1166
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and we all worked together usually on Memorial Day,

1167
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
4th of July, what's the other holiday?

1168
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Labor Day.

1169
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Labor Day.

1170
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah.

1171
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Have an picnic again.

1172
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Usually went out to the pond and then,

1173
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Herbert and I always took the kids and we went to,

1174
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
we owned some property out, big elk,

1175
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and we went out there, crawdanting.

1176
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Oh, I got a great picture for you to put the book on the crawdant.

1177
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, that felt like fun.

1178
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And then we went to ask somebody to come and eat crawdants.

1179
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We had crawdant feeds.

1180
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Seek pile of crawdants.

1181
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And then, as I say, we took the kids fishing up Quartz Creek,

1182
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and then finally we got a boat.

1183
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And by then, the rice has had a place at Triangle Lake,

1184
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and we would go down there sometimes with our boat,

1185
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and the kids' water ski.

1186
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Oh, that was fun.

1187
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That was when they were older maybe.

1188
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yes.

1189
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So, Kermit enjoyed his family life, it sounds like.

1190
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Oh, yeah, he was a family man.

1191
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
He had the meal.

1192
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
He would sometimes go and get equipment from other meals

1193
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
that were maybe no longer in service.

1194
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And he would say when he left, well,

1195
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I may not be back tonight because we might have trouble loading

1196
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or doing all this.

1197
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Almost always, he'd be home by midnight.

1198
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
He'd never stayed over him in the place.

1199
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
He'd just wanted to be there in the family.

1200
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He'd be home by the family.

1201
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'd never had any concerns about him full after him.

1202
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's a good thing.

1203
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
He was definitely a family man.

1204
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
How about summer vacations?

1205
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Did you guys ever take any trips?

1206
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Not really as summer vacations,

1207
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
but we, of course, had the place up the McKinsey,

1208
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
which was really nice because he had been in the three seas up there,

1209
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
which I told you about it.

1210
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And so we had that in common too,

1211
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
because I taught school up there.

1212
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And so when we came to having a second home,

1213
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
or the second, whatever it wasn't really a home,

1214
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
it was a mobile, no.

1215
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
What do you call those?

1216
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Not a mobile, yeah, I guess a mobile home.

1217
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Like a trailer.

1218
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, it was a trainer like the place.

1219
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And so when we bought the property to put the trailer on,

1220
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
it was up to McKinsey because we've been up there a lot,

1221
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
because we liked that area.

1222
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So he had done trail building when he was there in the CCC?

1223
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes.

1224
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Interesting.

1225
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So that made for a good weekend getaway, probably.

1226
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yes, it was a great place.

1227
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And the kids loved it.

1228
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
They loved to fish.

1229
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
We had three great fishing holes on that property.

1230
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And we liked it so well that after we had the mobile home for a while,

1231
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
it was a single ride.

1232
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And we decided that we liked it well enough.

1233
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And we wanted a fireplace, because then it was cozy.

1234
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
We could use it in the wintertime.

1235
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So we had him haul away that one and bring up a double ride.

1236
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Mm-hmm.

1237
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And I had that for a number of years after permit died.

1238
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But all of a sudden there was a crackhouse moved in next door.

1239
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And the people who owned that were from California.

1240
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And they rented it out.

1241
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And they brought up a lot of antiques and put in it.

1242
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Mm-hmm.

1243
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And it was just a gorgeous place.

1244
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
They rented it out.

1245
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And they was a crackhouse.

1246
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And the people who had it needed wood for their fireplace.

1247
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And they burned up all the antiques.

1248
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Mm-hmm.

1249
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And I thought they'll probably be over here next.

1250
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah.

1251
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And I thought this is no place for me.

1252
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So I sold it.

1253
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Mm-hmm.

1254
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And I just killed me to sell it.

1255
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Mm-hmm.

1256
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I was 40 miles from any fire or police help.

1257
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sure.

1258
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It was no place for a single woman.

1259
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah.

1260
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I don't understand of them.

1261
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yeah.

1262
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So I had to give it up.

1263
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And I still hate it.

1264
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Then we had to give that up.

1265
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah.

1266
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, sounds like you had lots of good years from it.

1267
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
No.

1268
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That's a fun out there.

1269
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Just have good memories.

1270
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1271
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's not a good thing, too.

1272
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So you mentioned having your holidays with Bruce and Betty.

1273
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And I realized I've never asked you what the transition was from when Bruce was sort

1274
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
of a nerdy kid who sat and read the ins like a video a time.

1275
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
When did you start to get close to him?

1276
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Well, I think that Betty had a lot to do with that.

1277
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Because she met Bruce because I had invited her to a summer party when we were in high school.

1278
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
She was going to college here.

1279
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And her father was an ROTC professor.

1280
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
He was a military man.

1281
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And so Bruce offered to take her home after the smoke.

1282
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And so they were soon married.

1283
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Then we did a lot of things together.

1284
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
We used to camp up at Spirit Lake where we had been our Bruce and I.

1285
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's been our childhood.

1286
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And so we did a lot of things together.

1287
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And then after Bruce died, Betty and I traveled a lot together.

1288
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So she brought the two of you closer together.

1289
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Right there.

1290
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
There's a brought him out of the house.

1291
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
He became a lot more after he was in the military.

1292
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I think he became a lot more social.

1293
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah.

1294
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, that's right.

1295
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Because you had told me that you saw each other a lot in San Francisco too.

1296
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah, that's down there.

1297
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Yes.

1298
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
That's right.

1299
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, I'd love to hear a little bit about your children.

1300
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay.

1301
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Now we're early.

1302
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, I guess we should start early.

1303
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Okay.

1304
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Well, can see oldest.

1305
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And he was born in Portland.

1306
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And he was a good baby.

1307
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
He was a real.

1308
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
We had him.

1309
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't know that we did we tell you.

1310
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Did we talk about the house that we had in Portland?

1311
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I'm not in great detail, no.

1312
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, I told you that the first house was the department in the, in the, in the safe way,

1313
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
where the safe way is now in the lights in.

1314
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Well, then we moved over to the house.

1315
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The canvas born from.

1316
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It was the Westminster Presbyterian church man's.

1317
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And it was a forest story house.

1318
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
A basement, a main floor.

1319
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
A four bedroom.

1320
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Second floor.

1321
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And a floored attic.

1322
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And so we called it the Roth Hotel.

1323
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Because everybody came to see the, the came to Portland.

1324
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Stayed with us.

1325
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
All your friends.

1326
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Well, Ken was born from there.

1327
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And then, then Craig came along.

1328
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And that was when we,

1329
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Craig was about six months old when we moved to Kervalas.

1330
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And the house that we had there was,

1331
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
well, all these floors.

1332
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And it had six plugins.

1333
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Three of them, I think, were in the kitchen, or maybe four.

1334
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I would gas lights.

1335
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
A sink that was weighed down here.

1336
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And I was pregnant with Craig.

1337
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And so, Kerma took out the kitchen and put in what they called a young,

1338
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
young, town sink.

1339
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And it was a sink with drainboards all one piece.

1340
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And so we put it up so I could do dishes.

1341
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And then we had Craig.

1342
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And the thing that I remember about Ken,

1343
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
what he was a little kid.

1344
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
He had a rabbit that he loved,

1345
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
stuffed rabbit.

1346
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
The stuffed.

1347
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And we had a backyard that we,

1348
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
a fence.

1349
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And so one day he was missing.

1350
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:21,000
The lady who had been helping me with Craig had left the gate open.

1351
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Well, I was just beside myself.

1352
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So there we lived a wider, I think it was.

1353
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Anyway, it was two blocks down to Broadway.

1354
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And Harry was walking along with the holding the ears of the rabbit.

1355
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Just wandering around, having a good time.

1356
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I was just pregnant.

1357
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
He was a very adventure some child.

1358
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Then Craig came along and he was born with no bicep

1359
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
or no tricep, and he's left arm.

1360
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
They think I had interunion and polio.

1361
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
That was when polio was so just becoming something

1362
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
that was everybody had to have a shot.

1363
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So Craig was never athletic.

1364
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Chris Ken was always very athletic.

1365
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
But Craig was, when he'd ride a tricycle,

1366
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
he could do a tricycle pretty well,

1367
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
but it came to bicycles.

1368
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
He couldn't balance.

1369
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Because he couldn't get that arm up.

1370
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So about, but he was in,

1371
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
we moved to Kermalison.

1372
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But he was about,

1373
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I would say maybe six weeks or so,

1374
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
into kindergarten.

1375
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
The doctor that we had here in Kermalison,

1376
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
said I want you to go down to San Francisco

1377
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and go to Stanford Medical School and see what they can do for him.

1378
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Because he'd come in at his little face.

1379
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
He'd fallen off his bicycle.

1380
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You know what his face was all scarred up.

1381
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
He just didn't have any balance.

1382
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So we took him down there.

1383
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And the story that I love to tell about Craig is,

1384
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We, my folks took us down to go.

1385
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We were going to fly down to San Francisco.

1386
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And it was fogged in.

1387
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And so we had to go on down and go by rail.

1388
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Well, Kermal and I were just beside ourselves.

1389
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
This was a very nerve-wracking experience

1390
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
for both of us to be taking this child

1391
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
down to the hospital.

1392
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We didn't know what was going to be the results of this.

1393
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So because my father was a teetotler,

1394
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
we didn't ever drink at home.

1395
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
We always called it juice.

1396
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And so we went into have some juice in the railroad car.

1397
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And we got a coke for Craig.

1398
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And the bartender there put a cherry in it.

1399
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And so when he came, he had the operation

1400
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and came out of the anesthesia.

1401
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And he was his legs and his arms were just thrashing.

1402
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And he yelled out,

1403
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
just in a loud voice,

1404
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I want a cherry in my mouth.

1405
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We were never able to tell my parents.

1406
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
That's what I thought.

1407
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You might think that's such a fun story.

1408
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
The little things that were just in his subconscious.

1409
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So anyway, we got through that.

1410
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And then Kathy was born.

1411
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And we were, we just expected another boy.

1412
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
We were just thrilled to have this daughter.

1413
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And then Kim was born four years later.

1414
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And the girls were really quite good seamstresses.

1415
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I suppose that I taught them a lot of those things.

1416
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And they burned,

1417
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
they were boo-ribbon winners for H,

1418
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
for their dresses that they made.

1419
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And I think it was Kathy went on to a state fair.

1420
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And got a boo-ribbon.

1421
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
They were really good seamstresses.

1422
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Still, they don't do much.

1423
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I think Kathy does more than Kim.

1424
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But they were very active in 4-H.

1425
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So were you still involved at 4-H?

1426
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yes.

1427
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And later when I was on the 4-H,

1428
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I was a trustee for the 4-H state board.

1429
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
They had.

1430
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And my dad was very instrumental in obtaining the property

1431
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
for 4-H of the 4-H camp that's over near Salem.

1432
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Right.

1433
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And I was very active in that for a long time.

1434
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Were you a 4-H leader as well?

1435
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And then the children were younger?

1436
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yes.

1437
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And I think I told you that Irma Seymour was my 4-H leader.

1438
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
He always worked with him.

1439
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So I've always been active in 4-H,

1440
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and still I am to a certain extent.

1441
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
We support the swimming pool at the camp.

1442
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I read that.

1443
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So interesting.

1444
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Were the boys in 4-H as well?

1445
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
No, they were both equal scouts.

1446
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Oh, uh-huh.

1447
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
In fact, that conversation was about that,

1448
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
because my great grandson is now in scouting.

1449
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Wow.

1450
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And so I took all the scouts,

1451
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
always were red, flannel, jackets.

1452
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And I happened to remember that in the cupboard out there,

1453
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I had cranks of scalp from his scouting.

1454
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Wow.

1455
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And so I gave it to my great grandchild.

1456
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And I took all the things off of it.

1457
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And it to the cleaners.

1458
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Oh, no.

1459
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's going down there.

1460
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
What's fine?

1461
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
No.

1462
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That's funny.

1463
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Huh.

1464
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think I read somewhere that Kermit was involved

1465
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
with the boys scouting.

1466
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yes.

1467
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Well, with the, uh, what, I don't know what they call that, uh,

1468
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
the headquarters are in Eugene for this area.

1469
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Uh-huh.

1470
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And he was active in that management of that.

1471
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
At the regional level.

1472
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't know what they call them trustees or what they call them.

1473
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But anyway, he was active in that for quite a while.

1474
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Wonderful.

1475
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Ah.

1476
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
So as a home economist, do you think that you were, um, more prepared

1477
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
than other women going into this whole childbearing thing to be able to,

1478
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I suppose so, you know, because we learned a lot of child education and what we were

1479
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
supposed to do and how we were supposed to handle problems.

1480
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
So that's sort of thing.

1481
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yeah.

1482
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I think probably.

1483
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Did you continue to do the kind of things that you had been teaching

1484
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
other women to do with in terms of preserving food and, um,

1485
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Well, I've always, uh, worked with the extension service to a certain extent,

1486
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,000
um, you know, even as a volunteer, um,

1487
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and I think that I did, I followed through on a lot of that.

1488
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Yeah.

1489
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Great.

1490
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
What do you think, um, was your,

1491
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
your strength as a mother?

1492
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Do you think there was something that you were in the family that everybody

1493
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
depended on you for?

1494
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Cooking, I think.

1495
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I think I'm good meal.

1496
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Yeah.

1497
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
That's a very good meal.

1498
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Well, and I think that we cooked healthy meals because I had learned that.

1499
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You know, we always had meat and probably potatoes of some sort of

1500
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
ice or starch of some sort and vegetables and salad.

1501
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
My husband always wanted to salad because when he was in the service,

1502
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
he didn't have any greens at all.

1503
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And he, I think we mentioned that he wanted lettuce when he's,

1504
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
when he's brother came to visit.

1505
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah.

1506
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And he always wanted greens.

1507
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So we always had balanced meals and we always sat down to eat together

1508
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and of course later my dad ate with us.

1509
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
That, that's something that I would not do again because I don't think

1510
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
it was fair to my children when you sit down to each or evening meal.

1511
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The kids want to talk about their days and my dad wanted to sort of,

1512
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
he, he was the conversation list and he wanted to tell us about his day.

1513
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And I don't think it was fair to my children to do that.

1514
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah.

1515
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But you know, you did what you had to do at that time.

1516
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
They accommodated.

1517
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yeah.

1518
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Yeah.

1519
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But it's true it's not all that common out.

1520
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I have a regular meal that itself is that.

1521
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
But as a result, the Kermit came home every day for lunch from the mail

1522
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
because you know, it was just a short distance.

1523
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Yeah.

1524
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And that was our quiet time together.

1525
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
The two of you.

1526
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Uh-huh.

1527
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Because we hear an often, well, sometimes not, well, quite often he would bring salesman home

1528
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,000
for lunch because the thing to do was for the salesman to take him out.

1529
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
You know, try to.

1530
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Uh-huh.

1531
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Win his favor.

1532
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1533
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And he'd say, oh, no, let's go home.

1534
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You'll go to something.

1535
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And so I think that that's, um, that was our time together and it was also.

1536
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I always had something in the pantry like a can of chicken or I could do a

1537
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
zillion things with chicken.

1538
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You know, it was chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken dumplings.

1539
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
You know, there were lots of things I could do on the spur of the moment.

1540
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Do, uh, so sometimes he just call 11 30 and say, can I bring someone so

1541
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
home and let's say, oh, sure, you know.

1542
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And when you say a can of chicken was that something that you had

1543
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
can't?

1544
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
No, no, it wasn't.

1545
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
No, I didn't want anything to do with those chickens.

1546
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Yeah.

1547
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Uh-huh.

1548
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I wanted them prepared.

1549
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah.

1550
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Well, that's one luxury we have now.

1551
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So, um, tell me for getting tired.

1552
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Are you still doing all right?

1553
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
No, I'm still in fine, but I suppose we ought to quit around three.

1554
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
All right.

1555
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I moved through this.

1556
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Um, I was, I'm almost in the same age range as your children.

1557
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So I'm thinking about the era when you were raising kids and thinking about how, um,

1558
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
it was such an era of change and more permissiveness and that sort of thing from,

1559
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
yeah, certainly from the era when you had been raised.

1560
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And you had been raised in such a strict way anyway.

1561
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes.

1562
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Was that, was that a tough transition for you to make, to figure out how to set rules

1563
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and discipline for your kids?

1564
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Well, I think that there was a lot of discipline you don't do this because

1565
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
your grandfather, you know, was this way.

1566
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Uh-huh.

1567
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And the other thing that I remember vividly, and I don't remember whether I told

1568
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
me this or not, but one day the teacher called me up when Kim was in school.

1569
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And, um, they, she said, we're talking about letting the girls wear pants to school.

1570
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And what did I think about it?

1571
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And I said, makes a lot of sense to me.

1572
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
You know, they turned their little bottoms upside down on all the, you know,

1573
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and playground.

1574
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, on the playground thing, I said, makes a lot of sense to me.

1575
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And so that's, that's when children, because otherwise, I see pictures of my kids in

1576
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
their grade school era.

1577
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And they always had dresses on.

1578
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then all of a sudden, the pants became popular.

1579
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Uh-huh.

1580
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah, I can remember when we used to have to change out of our school clothes

1581
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
and to our play clothes.

1582
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yes, that's right.

1583
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Uh-huh.

1584
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And those play clothes usually were pants.

1585
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah.

1586
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

1587
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I did change it a certain point.

1588
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
But you got through those teenage years without that too much.

1589
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
No.

1590
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
My girls didn't date.

1591
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Uh-huh.

1592
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Uh-huh.

1593
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I can't date it in college, but I don't remember that.

1594
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Well, he did date when he was a senior.

1595
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But I don't remember that we had to any concerns about that.

1596
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
They were pretty.

1597
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
You know, they had learned.

1598
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I used to tell them, don't miss behavior because somebody knows you and somebody

1599
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
who's going to paddle on you.

1600
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I see that same thing.

1601
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It's the beauty of living in a small town.

1602
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Yeah.

1603
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
But they're particular stages of childhood that you enjoyed more than others.

1604
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Like, did you love that stage when they were just little and...

1605
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Yes, I did.

1606
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And I think that I probably enjoyed the girls when they were all maybe six to twelve

1607
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
or something like that.

1608
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I really liked that age.

1609
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
They were all enough to be talked to and sensible.

1610
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And, you know, you could kind of guide them through that period.

1611
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I really enjoyed that part of it, I think.

1612
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I'm about the boys.

1613
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah.

1614
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Same.

1615
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
The boys were always so active in scouting.

1616
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And I think Kermit did a lot of the parenting at that age when the boys,

1617
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
because he would take in camping with the scouts.

1618
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And he would arrange to have them go and meet with other people to do their...

1619
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
to get their badges.

1620
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Mm-hmm.

1621
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I think he did a lot of the parenting with the boys.

1622
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Interesting.

1623
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And of course, he'd take them to the nail.

1624
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And lots of times he'd come home if he had to go to Eugene or Portland for a partner,

1625
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
something.

1626
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
He would come by and grab one of the boys and take them.

1627
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And that was very helpful to me because that gave me a little freedom.

1628
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Sure.

1629
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And I remember one time he was coming back from Eugene and he and Craig were singing.

1630
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And he wasn't watching this pedometer and he got stopped.

1631
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And so the cops said something about what were they doing.

1632
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And Craig piped up and says, well, Danny, I was singing.

1633
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And the cops said, you know, if more dads would do that,

1634
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
we'd be a lot better off.

1635
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You can go.

1636
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
No.

1637
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Sorry, didn't I?

1638
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It's a wonderful story.

1639
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Oh.

1640
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That's interesting.

1641
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
But then neither of your boys went into that field

1642
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
into what products are or...

1643
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
No, more scary or anything.

1644
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So I can start it out in forestry.

1645
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And then he would go out and have field trips and he'd get poison oak.

1646
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And he came back one day and he told us he said forestry isn't for me.

1647
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
So I can't go to the woods.

1648
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And by that time, I think he was seeing the writing on the wall to about that it was going to go that way.

1649
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah.

1650
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Uh-huh.

1651
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So he changed and went into business.

1652
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I see.

1653
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
And neither of the girls was ever interested.

1654
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Oh, no.

1655
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Girls been that era.

1656
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I don't see.

1657
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
They were just starting to come into the being.

1658
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I think they just had one or two girls in the forestry school.

1659
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And my dad didn't approve of that.

1660
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Yeah.

1661
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
He still had a big influence on your family.

1662
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Oh, yes.

1663
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
He surely did excuse me.

1664
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Sure.

1665
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Oh, who this could be?

1666
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Oh, I'm stiff from sitting there.

1667
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Oh, we've been here for a little bit.

1668
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Oh, uh-huh.

1669
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Just a package.

1670
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Oh, uh-huh.

1671
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Just a package.

1672
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Okay.

1673
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Always brings the doorbell.

1674
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Uh-huh.

1675
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Didn't know what you know that he's there.

1676
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So your father was sounds like he was very influential even in your life even after

1677
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
your children were born.

1678
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh, yes.

1679
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Uh-huh.

1680
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I think he was.

1681
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And he.

1682
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Well, you know.

1683
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
He really.

1684
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
He really grew old the roost because of his eating with us and.

1685
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yeah, I would say that.

1686
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Hmm.

1687
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And the children probably had that sense.

1688
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Like you say that they were eyes all over town.

1689
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yes.

1690
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
He was going to hear about it.

1691
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Oh, he was on the school board.

1692
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
You know, he knew everything that was going on.

1693
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Did I tell you the story about him?

1694
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
They were trying to raise money for taxes.

1695
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
The school board was.

1696
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And the man came to Lions Club and my dad was very prominent in the Lions Club.

1697
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Hmm.

1698
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
He was the one who started.

1699
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't know if you've been reading these articles that can.

1700
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Munford's been putting in.

1701
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Yeah.

1702
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And he was one of the principles who started the.

1703
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
The.

1704
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Right.

1705
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yeah.

1706
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
And.

1707
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Well, anyway.

1708
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
What was I going to say about that.

1709
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yeah.

1710
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Well, he.

1711
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
He.

1712
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He was in so many.

1713
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh, I know.

1714
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So.

1715
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
They.

1716
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
The superintendent of schools.

1717
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I think it was Dr. Van Lohn.

1718
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And he came to the Lions Club and made a plea for.

1719
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Then to all vote for the increase in school property taxes.

1720
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And my dad got up and he said, well, I feel more inclined to vote for this.

1721
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
He said.

1722
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Yeah.

1723
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
You can keep going because the other one will catch you.

1724
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah.

1725
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
He said.

1726
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
My.

1727
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
My grandson was just kicked out of the first grade.

1728
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And something about one of the other kids.

1729
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Kid was kicked out of the first grade because he was a big boy.

1730
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And he had a little bit of teacher for a teacher.

1731
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And she said a note home and said that he was misbehaving.

1732
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And what was I going to do about it.

1733
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And so I went down to see about it.

1734
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And I said, what does he do?

1735
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And she said, well, he won't keep his feet under the desk.

1736
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And she said, I try putting him out in the hall.

1737
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And he just sat out there and visited with everybody and enjoyed himself.

1738
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
So she said, I guess that's not the way to handle it.

1739
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And so I looked at her and I said, where does Kent sit?

1740
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And she said there.

1741
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
And I said, well, you know, if you go down to the sixth grade and get a desk,

1742
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
the fitting, you could probably, he probably wouldn't put his feet out.

1743
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And they, oh, oh, she said, I never thought about that.

1744
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So anyway, my dad told this story at the Lions Club.

1745
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And the old Dr. Van Loan came up afterwards and he said,

1746
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,000
TJ, when you've got something like that, would you just come and tell me privately?

1747
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:09,000
But you know, he had a lot of clout in the, because he wrote all these letters to the editor

1748
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and had an opinion on everything.

1749
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Sure.

1750
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And so the kids were pretty well, you know, if they didn't see pop, they knew somebody,

1751
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
some of these friends would see them.

1752
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah.

1753
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So they were pretty well.

1754
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Did I tell you that I used to worry?

1755
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:35,000
He would have articles in the paper about how many timbers,

1756
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
acres of timber land owned and something like this?

1757
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And I think, oh, why do you put it in the paper?

1758
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
It was about the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping.

1759
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And I was so worried that somebody, you know,

1760
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Thank you.

1761
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
And easy target.

1762
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1763
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And I worried about that a lot.

1764
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Uh-huh.

1765
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
But nothing ever happened.

1766
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
So it was a good thing.

1767
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Yeah.

1768
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
And how about your mom? Was she involved with your children?

1769
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Yes.

1770
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
She was a good babysitter.

1771
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
No.

1772
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And you know, she had that cart that was a golf cart.

1773
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And she would come by and they afternoon and take the kids in the golf cart.

1774
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And she had to go down to the grocery store.

1775
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
She'd take them with her.

1776
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Oh, I find it.

1777
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah.

1778
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So she was very much involved with the children.

1779
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I think she was more involved with Bonn and Bar,

1780
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
because Bruce and Betty traveled more than we did.

1781
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And she often kept them for several weeks at a time.

1782
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And then I would kind of take them for periods of time

1783
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
because I knew she needed to break.

1784
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Because, you know, she was getting older.

1785
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah.

1786
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And so the boys, the boys came down and made a lot.

1787
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It's a logging road with the trucks that my husband made.

1788
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And he worked at, um, he worked at another business.

1789
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And I forgot the name of it in Portland.

1790
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
But they, uh, it was during the war, uh, beginning of the war.

1791
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And, uh, the, the, the, not, not World War II.

1792
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
But, um, World War II was a Vietnam.

1793
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
It was next.

1794
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Probably Vietnam.

1795
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Yeah.

1796
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And he was, uh, he worked at this die casting company.

1797
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Uh-huh.

1798
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
And they made log trucks, if we kids size.

1799
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Uh-huh.

1800
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And, uh, they were, the employees were, were allowed to take parts home

1801
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that were not perfect.

1802
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Uh-huh.

1803
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And so Kermit would bring them home.

1804
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And he made, I don't know, six or eight log trucks.

1805
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
And these were big log trucks.

1806
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
They were about like that.

1807
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Uh-huh.

1808
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And paint them.

1809
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And, uh, they had to buy the tires.

1810
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
They were little tires like that.

1811
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
But, uh, he would, I think, uh, can't,

1812
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
these still has those log trucks.

1813
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Uh, I think that, um, he made six or eight of those.

1814
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And he would convert them to, uh, flat beds or dump trucks.

1815
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Uh-huh.

1816
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Or he, he would make little.

1817
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
The dump trucks would, he, he sort of changed the configuration of some of them.

1818
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Uh-huh.

1819
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Uh-huh.

1820
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And the, uh, Bonn and Bart and Ken and Craig would make logging roads all over the place.

1821
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
They, they'd love to do that.

1822
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Uh-huh.

1823
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And they would play.

1824
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And it was really no trouble for me to, to keep them,

1825
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
sometimes, to give my mother a rest.

1826
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Sure.

1827
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah.

1828
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Were they about the same age as your boys?

1829
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Yes.

1830
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Well, there was Craig.

1831
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Let's see.

1832
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Bonn.

1833
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Uh-huh.

1834
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Then.

1835
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Then.

1836
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Kermit came into the family.

1837
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Then.

1838
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Then.

1839
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Ken.

1840
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Then.

1841
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Bart.

1842
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Then.

1843
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Craig.

1844
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Uh-huh.

1845
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And then.

1846
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Kathy.

1847
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Uh-huh.

1848
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And then.

1849
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Kim came along later.

1850
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Uh-huh.

1851
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
The boys were pretty well.

1852
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Yeah.

1853
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So they were pretty much the same age.

1854
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Yeah.

1855
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
When.

1856
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Did you guys do holidays and things with their family?

1857
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Oh, yeah.

1858
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Christmas.

1859
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Yeah.

1860
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
We always had things getting in Christmas with them.

1861
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Uh-huh.

1862
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Well, that sounds like fun.

1863
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Uh-huh.

1864
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Uh-huh.

1865
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Uh-huh.

1866
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I think you said when you were talking to Wade about Christmas that your dad was a little

1867
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
shock that your holidays were more extravagant than the ones that you had had when you

1868
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
were growing.

1869
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Yes.

1870
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Well, yeah.

1871
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
We gave too much to the children.

1872
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Uh-huh.

1873
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And I'm saying the same thing about mine.

1874
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Uh-huh.

1875
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And regeneration probably feels that way.

1876
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Yeah.

1877
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Well.

1878
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But it's so much fun to indulge them.

1879
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Um.

1880
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Um.

1881
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Um.

1882
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Um.

1883
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I did have some questions about traveling.

1884
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Do you have a little energy?

1885
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Just five or three now.

1886
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Would you like?

1887
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Could I have a little bit more about traveling?

1888
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Uh-huh.

1889
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,000
You talked a little bit about your trip that the two of you took to Japan and that kind of thing.

1890
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Um.

1891
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And I'm.

1892
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
You didn't take any trips with the children during that time when they were growing up.

1893
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Oh, yes.

1894
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
We took them to Hawaii for several times.

1895
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And uh.

1896
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But we didn't ever take them farther than that.

1897
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I don't think.

1898
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Why is it big trip for a family of six?

1899
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Yes.

1900
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yes, it was.

1901
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It was quite a.

1902
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Quite a.

1903
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
John.

1904
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Yeah.

1905
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
And uh.

1906
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
What island did you go to when you went there?

1907
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Oh.

1908
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I think we went to the big island because we went up to the volcano.

1909
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
We thought that was educational.

1910
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yes.

1911
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah.

1912
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And uh.

1913
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,980
And then can would sometimes come by himself or Craig when they were a little bit

1914
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:01,980
older.

1915
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:05,980
But we'd take the two girls and then we took the two girls to Australia.

1916
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:09,980
But this was when when the boys were older and out.

1917
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,980
Ken was married and.

1918
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,980
Craig was.

1919
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:18,980
Or was Craig.

1920
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:23,980
I guess maybe he was married to when we took the girls to Australia.

1921
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:26,980
Mm-hmm.

1922
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,980
What inspired a trip to Australia?

1923
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:29,980
How did you choose that?

1924
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:31,980
Well, no.

1925
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,980
What made us go to Australia?

1926
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,980
I think we just started wanting to go.

1927
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:38,980
Kermit always wanted to go that direction.

1928
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,980
He never wanted to go to Europe.

1929
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Mm-hmm.

1930
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:45,980
I think we just thought that was a good place to go.

1931
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:46,980
Mm-hmm.

1932
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,980
Yeah.

1933
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,980
And I think Kathy wanted to go.

1934
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:50,980
She wanted to go.

1935
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:56,980
It was the time they were building the music center.

1936
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:59,980
We're like opera house in Melbourne.

1937
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:04,980
And I think that she was very interested in the way that was constructed.

1938
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:05,980
Mm-hmm.

1939
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:06,980
Yeah.

1940
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:07,980
It's an amazing thing.

1941
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:10,980
Because Kermit and she spent one whole day of our trip.

1942
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:16,980
Photographing it and walking around it and going through it.

1943
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:25,980
And she did a report for class at Oregon State and got some credits for doing all of that.

1944
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,980
So she knew from the very beginning that she wanted to be at.

1945
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,980
And I guess she did.

1946
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,980
She loves our protector.

1947
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:31,980
Mm-hmm.

1948
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:32,980
Wonderful.

1949
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,980
What does your younger daughter do?

1950
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:37,980
She's, she wanted to be a nurse.

1951
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:38,980
Mm-hmm.

1952
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:40,980
But she met her husband instead.

1953
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:42,980
And so then she took education.

1954
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:43,980
Oh.

1955
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,980
She's been a school teacher and a substitute teacher.

1956
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,980
Mm-hmm.

1957
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:49,980
Mm-hmm.

1958
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,980
That's wonderful.

1959
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:56,980
But she didn't, she never was a regular teacher.

1960
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:03,980
Because when they were married, she twins quite early in her married life.

1961
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:04,980
Mm-hmm.

1962
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,980
And so I think she just did substituting.

1963
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:08,980
Mm-hmm.

1964
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:10,980
But she loves teaching.

1965
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:11,980
Mm-hmm.

1966
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:13,980
So you've stayed very close with your children.

1967
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:14,980
It sounds like.

1968
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:15,980
Oh, yeah.

1969
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:16,980
As adults, your parents don't know.

1970
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:17,980
No, they're here now.

1971
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:18,980
Come and mold or here.

1972
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,980
Huh.

1973
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,980
That's right.

1974
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:22,980
Because they're building the courtyard.

1975
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,980
The courtyard.

1976
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:24,980
Mm-hmm.

1977
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,980
Are you involved with that project?

1978
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,980
Well, somewhat.

1979
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,980
Yeah.

1980
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,980
I...

1981
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:33,980
When they get in a bind, I help them out.

1982
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:34,980
Mm-hmm.

1983
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:38,980
Not only financially, but otherwise too sometimes.

1984
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:39,980
Mm-hmm.

1985
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:44,980
Because you have that experience with dealing with contractors and real estate things.

1986
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,980
Mm-hmm.

1987
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:50,980
Have you worked with any of your other children on construction projects or real project?

1988
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:51,980
No.

1989
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,980
No.

1990
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,980
They're all kind of very handy.

1991
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:55,980
Like he's daddy's.

1992
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,980
Very he can do anything.

1993
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:58,980
Mm-hmm.

1994
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,980
And, uh, Craig's pretty handy.

1995
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:06,980
But he's, uh, his recreation consists of hunting and fishing.

1996
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:07,980
Mm-hmm.

1997
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,980
Mm-hmm.

1998
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:12,980
That's something they used to do with their dad to the hunting.

1999
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:13,980
Oh, yes.

2000
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:14,980
Oh, yes.

2001
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:15,980
Oh, he's got their deer.

2002
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,980
Mm-hmm.

2003
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,980
We had some forest lands out here.

2004
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:24,980
And we, uh, reserved that for family hunting.

2005
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:25,980
Mm-hmm.

2006
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,980
And, uh, so that there were other people shooting around him.

2007
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:29,980
Mm-hmm.

2008
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:30,980
Good idea.

2009
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:31,980
And, uh, yeah.

2010
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,980
So, uh, they've always hunted and fished.

2011
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:35,980
Mm-hmm.

2012
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:36,980
Mm-hmm.

2013
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:41,980
That can doesn't do that much, but Craig does a lot too much.

2014
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:42,980
Mm-hmm.

2015
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,980
Mm-hmm.

2016
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:49,980
Well, I think it's admirable that you're still so close with everybody.

2017
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:50,980
Mm-hmm.

2018
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:51,980
Mm-hmm.

2019
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:57,980
Well, I think we're, we're as close as, you know, we talk probably every week.

2020
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:58,980
Mm-hmm.

2021
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:03,980
At least, sometimes, you know, if there's something going on, we talk every other day.

2022
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:11,980
But, you know, just like Gary called me, you know, he, you know, he wants, but he, he calls me every once in a while.

2023
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:13,980
Well, that's my grandson.

2024
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:14,980
Your grandson.

2025
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:15,980
So, yeah.

2026
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:16,980
It's kind of nice.

2027
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:17,980
Yeah.

2028
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:18,980
Absolutely.

2029
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:23,980
And it sounds like you must have been the kind of mother that everybody was sort of comfortable with.

2030
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:25,980
Well, I guess they were.

2031
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,980
Because they sure, uh, you know, they keep in touch.

2032
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:30,980
Mm-hmm.

2033
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:32,980
That's nice thing to be able to say.

2034
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:33,980
Mm-hmm.

2035
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,980
Yeah.

2036
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:36,980
Good.

2037
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:37,980
Good.

2038
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,980
Well, we could take a break here as he'd like.

2039
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,980
All right.

2040
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:47,980
Next time, we'll go on to talking a little bit about, uh, more about your community work.

2041
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:53,980
And we can, you know, we can start back in these days when you were involved with your kids and trying to work.

2042
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:54,980
Yeah.

2043
01:48:54,980 --> 01:49:03,980
I had a couple of things here about, uh, when we lived over on Jackson Street, but we had a, uh, I, uh,

2044
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:07,980
Holly, the whole, the whole role of Holly trees.

2045
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:10,980
And so every Christmas, we trimmed the Holly trees.

2046
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:15,980
And then the girls would put them put the clippings in the wheelbarrow.

2047
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:20,980
And they'd go up and down Jackson Street and ask anybody if they wanted Holly for Christmas.

2048
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:21,980
Uh-huh.

2049
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,980
They just gave it to them, you know.

2050
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,980
Oh, sweet.

2051
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,980
So that was kind of nice.

2052
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:26,980
Uh-huh.

2053
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:27,980
That was a holiday tradition, huh?

2054
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:28,980
Uh-huh.

2055
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:36,980
Did you have some other holiday traditions that were different or leftover from your growing up years?

2056
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:37,980
Uh-huh.

2057
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:46,980
Oh, I don't know that we, we certainly had food that was very traditional, but, uh, we always had turkey

2058
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:53,980
and always had dressing and, uh, I could tell you some funny stories about that.

2059
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:58,980
And so it putting, uh, that was carrot, putting, steam, putting.

2060
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,980
Uh-huh.

2061
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:01,980
And, uh, interesting.

2062
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:06,980
And we usually had boiled onions, a little pearl onion.

2063
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:07,980
Uh-huh.

2064
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:11,980
And, uh, cranberry ice.

2065
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,980
They always had that.

2066
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,980
Uh-huh.

2067
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:15,980
As in ice cream?

2068
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,980
Uh-huh.

2069
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:17,980
What is cranberry ice that is there?

2070
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:18,980
Oh, no.

2071
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,980
It's a ice that you eat with meat.

2072
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:22,980
Uh-huh.

2073
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,980
You know.

2074
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,980
Here to that.

2075
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,980
Oh, very fancy dinner has the clear-year palate.

2076
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:29,980
Uh-huh.

2077
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,980
Uh-huh.

2078
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:31,980
Uh-huh.

2079
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:32,980
So I could change it.

2080
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:34,980
Is it shaped in both?

2081
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:35,980
No.

2082
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:43,980
We always just made it, uh, um, you know, with a beater and then we scoop it out and put it in, uh,

2083
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,980
in a little sherbet dish.

2084
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:46,980
Uh-huh.

2085
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:50,980
And that was served with the, uh, all the hot things.

2086
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:51,980
Okay, turkey.

2087
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,980
Sweet potatoes.

2088
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,980
Candied sweet potatoes.

2089
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:55,980
Um-huh.

2090
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:57,980
Mashed potatoes and gravy.

2091
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:58,980
Uh-huh.

2092
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:00,980
Standard menu.

2093
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,980
Always.

2094
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:02,980
Still is.

2095
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:03,980
Except for the sweet pudding.

2096
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:06,980
I haven't heard of anybody making sweet pudding in a very long time.

2097
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,980
Well, we always made carrot pudding.

2098
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:12,980
That was, but it's made with sweet.

2099
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:13,980
Uh-huh.

2100
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:25,980
And, uh, uh, uh, uh, what do they call the stuff you put on the top of the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

2101
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:28,980
how you make it, ship with sugar and egg and.

2102
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:29,980
Marine?

2103
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:30,980
What?

2104
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:31,980
Marine?

2105
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:32,980
No.

2106
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,980
Uh-huh.

2107
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,980
Why can't I think of the name?

2108
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:38,980
I guess I haven't thought of it since last year.

2109
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,980
Uh-huh.

2110
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:44,980
She's an egg and it's not Marine.

2111
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:50,980
Well, I can't think of what, what it is now that we always put on top of it.

2112
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,980
I can, I can still see my mother sitting in front of the fireplace.

2113
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:58,980
Before we had beaters, you know, and she would whip that stuff.

2114
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:00,980
You're good for ever to make.

2115
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,980
No, Marshmallow.

2116
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,980
No.

2117
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,980
No.

2118
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:05,980
Uh-huh.

2119
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:09,980
Did we talk about the Burlington family and Uncle Gus?

2120
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:11,980
No, but I'd love to hear about them.

2121
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,980
You didn't, we didn't, well, we've got to talk about it.

2122
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:17,980
I know you talked a way about Uncle Gus bringing you raisins as a kid.

2123
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:21,980
Yeah, well, that's, but we've done that thing.

2124
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:22,980
Uh-huh.

2125
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:49,980
Well, I just, uh, the date that, um, uh, I think I was going to look up some dates for you.

2126
01:52:49,980 --> 01:53:02,980
And Kermit died at 59 and he died in 1979.

2127
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:04,980
Had he been ill at all before that?

2128
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:16,980
Well, not, you know, he, he always was not just, well, we didn't, I think that we always thought that he was fragile,

2129
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:20,980
but, you know, but didn't realize what it was.

2130
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:25,980
You know, in those days, heart things were, it was very different then.

2131
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:26,980
Yeah.

2132
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:34,980
Well, we made a big strides in heart.

2133
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:37,980
Well, I guess that's all I had on my little.

2134
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:41,980
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I think, oh, we need to talk about this.

2135
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:42,980
Yeah.

2136
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:43,980
That's a good thing.

2137
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:48,980
I thought you took notes and, and if you think about it, things definitely bring them in.

2138
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:49,980
Yeah.

2139
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:54,980
So, so, Kermit died just of, of a sudden heart attack?

2140
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:55,980
Yes.

2141
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:56,980
Uh-huh.

2142
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:57,980
He was just fine.

2143
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:03,980
And he, we had come back from a trip to Mexico and, uh, he went down.

2144
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:07,980
He was building a photography studio in the basement.

2145
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:12,980
And he thought he'd take up photography's kind of a application.

2146
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:13,980
Mm-hmm.

2147
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:19,980
And, uh, he came upstairs and he said, uh, are you ready to go and do errands downtown?

2148
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:22,980
And I said, yeah, I'm ready just as soon as I finish this note.

2149
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:26,980
I said, I'm writing, thank you's to the people that they're nice to us to.

2150
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:33,980
In Mexico and, uh, all of a sudden, I looked over and he was laid out on the bed.

2151
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:36,980
And I said, Kermit, what's the matter?

2152
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,980
And, uh, he just kind of looked at me, you know.

2153
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:43,980
And I went over and I felt his forehead and it was just sweaty.

2154
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:44,980
Mm-hmm.

2155
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,980
And, uh, I said, what is the matter?

2156
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:51,980
I said, I think I better call the doctor and he said, yes, I guess so.

2157
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,980
And, uh, I think he knew what he had.

2158
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:55,980
Mm-hmm.

2159
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,980
But I didn't at the time.

2160
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:02,980
And, uh, so I called the doctor and he said, getting to the hospital, getting to the hospital.

2161
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:06,980
And so I said, can you walk out to the car?

2162
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,980
And he said he thought he could.

2163
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:08,980
So he did.

2164
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,980
Mm-hmm.

2165
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:17,980
Then he threw up and, you know, I ran to get a pan so that we could, if he threw up again,

2166
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,980
Why?

2167
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:22,980
We could, didn't need to stop and we got him out to the hospital.

2168
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,980
And some little man came up.

2169
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,980
I didn't know him from Adam.

2170
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:29,980
And I think he thought that he, that I knew who he was.

2171
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:33,980
He apparently was the heart doctor and I didn't know him from Adam.

2172
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:37,980
And as Ollie said to me, he says, your husband's a very sick man.

2173
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:38,980
Mm-hmm.

2174
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:40,980
And I thought, well, what's he sick about?

2175
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:41,980
You know?

2176
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,980
Yeah.

2177
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:43,980
I said, well, can I see him?

2178
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,980
And he said, yeah, I'm going to see him.

2179
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,980
But I'm still in know they had a heart attack.

2180
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:49,980
Mm-hmm.

2181
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:53,980
And, uh, so he lived that day.

2182
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,980
And then the next day they took him to Portland,

2183
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,980
Oh, hey, just you.

2184
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,980
And it was February.

2185
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:04,980
And it was, I see, oh, there was this much ice on the streets everywhere.

2186
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,980
Mm-hmm.

2187
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:08,980
And I didn't think we'd ever make it uphill.

2188
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:12,980
But the ambulance, I don't know if they had chains or not.

2189
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:14,980
But they made it up the hill.

2190
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:15,980
Mm-hmm.

2191
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:20,980
And, uh, I knew he was very sick when they, then they made everybody get out of the elevator

2192
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:21,980
and let us in.

2193
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:22,980
Mm-hmm.

2194
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:27,980
I knew that there was something bad going on.

2195
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:29,980
So he just lived that night.

2196
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:31,980
And he was gone the next day.

2197
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:32,980
Mm-hmm.

2198
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:35,980
So, my life changed.

2199
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:36,980
Yeah.

2200
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:38,980
Yeah.

2201
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:39,980
Yeah.

2202
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:42,980
I'm like a really sudden change.

2203
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:44,980
You never know what the future brings.

2204
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:46,980
So you better live every day.

2205
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:47,980
Yeah.

2206
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,980
Well, sounds like he did live.

2207
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:51,980
He sounds like he enjoyed his life.

2208
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:54,980
Oh, he did, he enjoyed every day.

2209
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:55,980
Yeah.

2210
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:56,980
Yeah.

2211
01:56:56,980 --> 01:57:00,980
And let's have good hobbies and travel and stuff.

2212
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:01,980
Yeah.

2213
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:04,980
Let's go to a short.

2214
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,980
Mm.

2215
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:11,980
Well, thank you for telling me about that.

2216
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:12,980
Mm.

2217
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:13,980
Yeah.

2218
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:16,980
I'm eager to talk to you too about, um,

2219
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,980
I try to imagine you stepping into,

2220
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:23,980
well, taking over there at the property business and that sort of thing at that point.

2221
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:27,980
I guess you had been so involved that it wasn't that big of a lead.

2222
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:33,980
No, it wasn't because I think he had a premonition all the time that he would,

2223
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:40,980
that I would outlive him because my family had, you know, sort of an older,

2224
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:44,980
reputation of whatever.

2225
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:48,980
And his family had always died suddenly.

2226
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:58,980
And so he, he was pretty insistent that I be aware of everything that was going on in financial things.

2227
01:57:58,980 --> 01:57:59,980
Mm-hmm.

2228
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:00,980
Yeah.

2229
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:03,980
We always talked over every deal.

2230
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:04,980
Mm-hmm.

2231
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:07,980
So I just went on from there.

2232
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,980
We just picked right up and kept moving with it.

2233
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:11,980
Uh-huh.

2234
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:12,980
Mm-hmm.

2235
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:13,980
Good.

2236
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:16,980
Next, next time I'd like to talk more about, um,

2237
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:19,980
not only your community activism.

2238
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:32,980
I have said many times that hate is like an asset that does as much damage to the vessel in which it is stored as to the object on which it is poured.

2239
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:33,980
Mm-hmm.

2240
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:40,980
The other one is Gem of the Day when the tide of life turns against you and the current,

2241
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:44,980
and the current, current upsets your boat.

2242
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:51,980
Don't waste tears on what might have been just lie on your back and float.

2243
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:53,980
That's so wonderful.

2244
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:57,980
Those are two things that I look at.

2245
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:00,980
Yep.

2246
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,980
We're still alive.

2247
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:03,980
Yep.

2248
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:04,980
Beautiful.

2249
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:05,980
Thank you.

2250
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,980
Thank you.

2251
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:08,980
Keep all that stuff there, handy.
