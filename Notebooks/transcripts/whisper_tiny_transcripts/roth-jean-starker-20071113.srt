1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is my official. I'm in the home of Jean Starker Roth and today is November 13th, 2007.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today Jean and I are going to be talking about some of the community activities that she's been involved with.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And I'd like to ask her some questions as well on a more philosophical side of things asking her to reflect a little bit about her life and some of the things that she's accomplished.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So when we left off last time, you had just told me about permit permits passing.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
At that time, you were your children were grown.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Almost everybody was out of the house and in college.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And that's where it came.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can't wait till here.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
She was in the sorority house. She was the same.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then when her dad died, by then she moved home to be with me.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And she was engaged and to be married in June of that year.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He died in February.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And so she said she'd come home and stay with me.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And so I got to know my future son-in-law quite well during that period.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But it was a very tough time to be enthusiastic about a wedding.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And you know, I knew her wasn't going to be with us.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Anyway, that was where that stood, I guess.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you have other friends in that sort of thing at that era who were really comfort to you, sort of took you through that difficult?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, not really.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, it shouldn't say that.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There were a couple of couples that really stood by me.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But it's amazing.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In that era, and I think it's true today when you are no longer a couple, it's a different story.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Different social scenes.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I had one lady's tell me very bluntly, she said,

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, I won't be inviting you to dinners anymore.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It makes an uneven number.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Interesting.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so, you know, people see things differently.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But a mighty hell of sage to him, howl.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She was a she and Jim were wonderful support.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And now I'm kind of supporting them because Jim has a disease that we will not get well from.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And so, I try to take her out to lunch and do things with her now.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, you know, it all comes full circle.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, it does.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, that's an interesting statement to, because I think that has probably changed.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In this generation, I don't think there is that same sense that you only socialize with couples.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's lots of relationships among women.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, that's right.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When there was at that time.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And you probably built those kind of relationships gradually as you.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you know, the thing of it is that.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think that people don't realize when you're in your 50s.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What it's going to be like when you're alone when you're in your 80s.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And people are much more aware of that I think now when they used to be.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
People were more self-centered I think.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then the other thing that I think about my life is that when I did everything together,

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we weren't big on going places with other couples.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We went with our family.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We went fishing.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We went hunting with the boys.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I did my little things with the hospital and that sort of thing.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But basically we did our social things just together.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Uh-huh.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you had a really special bond and that's hard to recreate.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
More substituted.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So what kind of things did you do in that time to kind of move through the morning stage?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, I plan the wedding.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And that was a full time job.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can imagine.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And of course when a person dies, they're so much to take care of.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And as I've mentioned before, I had very little money that was coming in routinely.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I had to figure out how I was going to support myself and whether I had to go back

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to work or what I was going to do.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because we had a lot of assets, but we didn't have any cash flow.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And so I hired a man to manage my first lands that were left over from the mail.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And as I've said before, I trusted him implicitly.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I really didn't feel like I had a handle on it.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because I didn't know anything about Timberland and managing it.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so he did a lot of work on how I don't know what they call that.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He drew pictures of the forest and then where we should log and where we should do with different sections of it.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And we should have put that better.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But anyway, that went on for a couple of years.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And when I needed some money, I'd say, you know, got a log.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But then I decided that after I got my wits about me and got kind of settled down, I thought,

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
well, you know, I know a lot about real estate and how that works.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So I think I'll do a 1031 just like my father did.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And so I sold off the timber manager surveyed the timber land that I wanted to sell first.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And to see how much I could get from that.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And so then I found a building that I could buy.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And so we changed those two.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And that worked out so well that I did it for more times.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Because that gave you at least a regular source of rent.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because I had the money coming in from the rents from the real estate.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then I knew how much I had to spend.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So anyway, that worked out very well.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And it's still to this day.

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I own those properties.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He said the biomarker property was one of those things.

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, the biomarker was a little different.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because I hadn't heard of that from my mother's estate.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And so that was a little bit different.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But it also had a 30 year lease on it.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Which was just peanuts.

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You know, because it was so such an old easy.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why my father did that?

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I do not know.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But anyway, there wasn't much income from that.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I see.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Not like it is today.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is that still your property today?

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I own that corner there.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ninth and circle.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's been very.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now that I have a decent lease.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So it gives me some income.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's good.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you got involved in your real estate business.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And was that the time that you sort of started getting involved in community activity?

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And we, I had always been interested in the hospital.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because my dad had always, he was one of the movers and shakers when the hospital was in bankruptcy

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
down here on the Harrison Street.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And he and a group of other men pulled that hospital out of the,

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
got it going again.

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then my husband was interested in the hospital and served on the board of the hospital

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
when they moved from Harrison out to the hill.

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And so I was always involved in the auxiliary.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And my mother and Mrs. Ed Woodcock were the two ladies who started, they held a tea and asked women

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to come.

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And that's how the auxiliary started the present hospital.

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's interesting.

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So that we were always involved as a family, more or less, in the hospital.

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And of course I'm a wind permit, they made me an honorary trustee of the justee board.

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And so I've been very active in that and helped raise money for the various projects

134
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
that they've had, like the Pastaiga house.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was co-chair with the heart center with Mario Pastaiga.

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then I also supported him when he wanted to do his house.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They call it the house.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And so he and I worked together real closely on that.

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's fundraising for the most part.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And were you also involved in a cancer center there at the hospital?

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

144
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the hallway out in that building is named for Kermit.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Was that his project as well?

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, you didn't.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, I'm really, I think that was pretty much my project.

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it was one of the first fundraising projects that I had.

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Because I knew a lot of people in town, you know.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I kind of knew who to ask.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's what's important.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have a long list of things that you've been involved with here.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I could ask you about each one of them.

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But you could also just tell me to direct me a little bit.

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Which ones you feel are your major points of pride?

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, of course the park is very much.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And that was an interesting how that came about.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I killed her built this house.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And when we were through building it, he came to me and asked me if I would loan him some money

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to own the corner where the park is.

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mm-hmm.

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And he asked, he had plans drawn up.

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And he was going to build a big high rise, something a rather there of office buildings.

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And I said, no, I said, I don't think that's what ought to be on that corner.

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And I said, the chamber is next door.

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're going to hide the chamber of commerce building.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Mm-hmm.

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And as people come over the bridge, they will not see where the chamber is.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mm-hmm.

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I said, I don't think that that ought to be built on that corner.

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, he picked up on that.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Mm-hmm.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And within, I think it was just two or three weeks.

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was a very short period of time.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There was a consensus between the university, the city, and the chamber.

179
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And they all pitched in and bought that property from Ike.

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mm-hmm.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And then they came to me and asked if I would land escape it.

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And so that's how permit's name is on that part.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I see.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Mm-hmm.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So that all worked out just fine.

187
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Everybody was happy.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And I still look after it.

189
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I get after them when they don't keep the park up.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because I have also donated funds to the then county foundation for the purpose of keeping that park up.

191
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And they're supposed to use it for the, you know, to put in some perennials.

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And sort of thing.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And now I'm after the chamber because their trees have grown up so much that you can't see their building.

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mm-hmm.

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And I think they ought to take those trees down.

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And so that when people come over the bridge, they can see where the chamber is.

198
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's true.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So anyway, I'm working on that.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's good.

202
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've never stopped that kind of thing.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Keep them.

204
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Keep them spiced up there.

205
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Now let's see.

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The other thing I think is that I belong to the homeck.

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And that was started.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My interest in that was a long, long, long ago.

209
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And that was an idea.

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It was the lady in charge of the homeck part of the state extension service.

211
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And she and I had known each other because, of course, I'd grown up in Kervales, and they live not far from us.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, when I was teaching school up from McKenzie, but she called me one day.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Did was that in Wades thing?

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, about taking the job with in class up at it.

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is different.

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So I was up the McKenzie teaching and that summer before the summer was out.

220
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She called me one to know if I wanted to job in Lane County doing work with people who wanted to process their produce.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Either canning or freezing or whatever.

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I said, oh, I'd love a job for the summer.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So she said, well, fine.

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So then about halfway through the summer, why she called me.

225
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And she said, we have an opening in an estoria for a war food assistant.

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And this is during the war.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, you did tell me about that.

228
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Well, then I won't repeat that.

229
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

230
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And so that's how I got into the extension service because then the war food assistant was then.

231
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The class of county liked what we did up there with the women.

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And so they asked, they, they, you see extension services is funded by federal state and county funds.

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And so the county was going to go ahead and do their part to fund the extension service and that county was still going.

234
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But I started that whole program up there.

235
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So that was part of the state.

236
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Home economic system.

237
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Uh-huh.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then you became a rusty on that.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What they called a home demonstration.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A demonstration.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Otherwise known as a home demon.

243
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hahaha.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's kind of a positive and a negative.

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, right.

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I guess you can see.

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Huh.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And then eventually became the chair of the College of Home Economic Development Council.

249
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

250
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That was the stuff that you took.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, that was when a Kinsey Green was Dean.

252
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I was chairman of the Advisory Committee for probably six or seven years.

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then when the Tammy Brave became the Dean, why she asked me to continue.

254
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
However, we don't have a chairman.

255
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't think as such.

256
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We just have a advisory committee.

257
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I see.

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And one of the some of the projects that you did through that group.

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And you're well.

260
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We raised money too for the college.

261
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And we talk about where the college is going.

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What needs to be done.

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What needs to be processed in the way of whatever we think that people ought to be thinking about.

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You know, they come when Tammy Brave took over that Dean's ship.

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It was combined with the College of Physical Education, I think it was.

266
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And then they called it Health and Human Science.

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And so she came to me and wanted to know about the history of home economic side of that.

268
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And she had the other group.

269
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And we formed them together.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So now we do both.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I see.

272
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And is that the group that started the Bates Family Study Center?

273
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes.

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I was on that committee to help with that.

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is the purpose of that study center?

276
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's mostly studies of either children, development, which is the, the have a.

277
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Arts degree, nursery school there.

278
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And also gerontology.

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And so, but it's expanded a lot since we started.

280
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think there's lots of research goes on on there.

281
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know, I think the bone density project is probably in the basement of the women's building.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't think it's over at the Bates Center.

283
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But it's all intertwined.

284
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Although that research.

285
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So the Bates Center is an actual building.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

287
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes.

288
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I was on the committee that helped fund that.

289
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We raised quite a bit of money for that.

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Among them was the lady who was.

291
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The original Betty Crocker.

292
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And she was a graduate of Oregon State.

293
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I didn't realize that.

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes.

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And so, I'm trying to figure it out.

296
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Anyway, she didn't.

297
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
She came out here from and worked with us to get this, to get it going.

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And took a big interest in it.

299
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And of course, left us the big sum of money that the major donor of that building.

300
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because it's named after her.

301
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, she didn't like much staying downtown at the hotel.

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So she used to come and stay with me.

303
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh.

304
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I enjoy being with her because we had an awfully good time when she stayed with me.

305
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And then I would take her, you know, around where she wanted to go.

306
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That time I drove a lot better than I drive now.

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And so I provided transportation for her.

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
More fun.

309
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So she, was she older than you?

310
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, yes.

311
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
She's been gone many years now.

312
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She began to go downhill.

313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
During the time that she gave the money to the family study center.

314
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And then the last time she came out, she really wasn't herself.

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
She came with a gentleman who was her.

316
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know what you call him.

317
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm a kind of a consultant for their money.

318
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And he took kind of took over caring for her too.

319
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But she stayed with me and he stayed downtown.

320
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's fun.

321
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So I offered these baits.

322
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
These baits.

323
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I have to hear that mean.

324
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

325
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's an awful way for people like that, isn't it?

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I just did it earlier today, though.

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So you were also involved in the 4-H foundation at the state level.

328
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, because my head, I think we talked about that.

329
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
When I was growing up, I had the daughter of the head of the state.

330
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Harry Seymour was head of the state.

331
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I had her, his daughter for my 4-H teacher.

332
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Our leader, I guess you'd say.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And so I was always active in 4-H.

334
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
When my children came along, they were active in 4-H.

335
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Both of the girls had, they were state winners in their address competition.

336
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
They took, I taught them some, but they had a great leader.

337
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Mrs. Wells was her name.

338
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
They lived out on the corner of Walnut.

339
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And 20.

340
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Walnut.

341
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Where's the stop sign at Walnut before you go up the hill?

342
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, there's the stop late at 27th and then at 29th.

343
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, I think it's the one at 29th.

344
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Because that's the one where you go out 29th and go up and around the hill and then down.

345
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well, she ended that corner and why she was a great leader.

346
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
She knew a lot about sewing and I thought it was better for the girls to get it from somebody else.

347
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So they went out there and sewed a lot for her.

348
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And then my dad was one of the movers and shakers along with Bergen.

349
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The guy that was head of the state 4-H was his name.

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, I have to look that up.

351
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay, I don't remember what it meant.

352
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Bergen sticks in mine.

353
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Bergen, Bergen Hutton?

354
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I think that was the name.

355
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I can check on that too.

356
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah, put a question.

357
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay, that because I don't know for sure.

358
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Anyway, Bergen Hutton, okay, well, just say that's who it is.

359
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Came to my dad and he wanted to buy this property over in Salem that was for sale and it was Timbernan.

360
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And so my dad went over there and the idea was to build a camp for 4-Hers.

361
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, it was a pretty big project.

362
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And my dad was very involved in that.

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And so then when it came along, I was a treasure, I think, you know.

364
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I don't know, I was some officer in the 4-H program that was established to run that.

365
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
To run that camp at the state level.

366
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes.

367
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And eventually we had to sell off half of the timberland, which just killed me because it was should have been self-sustaining.

368
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But, you know, people don't realize that timber is a renewable resource.

369
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And you just harvested every 40 years instead of every year, like a lot of crops.

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

371
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And so we could have, if we've been able to save that land, we could have had it rotating.

372
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So that we could have always had some income, didn't work out.

373
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But they did save half of it.

374
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And now we've got a really wonderful fundraiser, Randy is his name.

375
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What he's last name is, but he's great.

376
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And he is running the camp and they're just, and they're getting them.

377
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What do you call it?

378
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I want to say they're applying for fundraising.

379
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
For grants?

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes, yes.

381
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And now they're just doing really well.

382
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And they're able to keep it up and it looks great.

383
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And so I was involved in that as being on the 4-H board.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And so I became very interested in that because I wanted to see it go.

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Sure.

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah.

387
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And my dad provided money for the swimming pool of that camp.

388
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then Kermit and I gave some money for the upkeep of it.

389
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It seems like in general, you had a few that swimming related.

390
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes.

391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That you gave.

392
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Was there a special reason that you were interested?

393
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We were always thought that swimming was very important for Oregonians because we have so

394
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
much water.

395
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And when we would see people drown because they couldn't swim, we thought that was just

396
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
terrible.

397
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And so we've always supported water-related activities.

398
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And we, and I still do that because I support through the Bend County Foundation.

399
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I support over instance, lifts for people to get in and out of pools.

400
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So they can swim.

401
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then I think we already talked about the girls going to camp.

402
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yes.

403
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And they didn't want to go back because it wasn't a swim.

404
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So Kermit and I talked it over and we'd make some money in the stock market.

405
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And so we decided we'd give stock to them.

406
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And so they built their swimming pool.

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But we wouldn't let anybody know that we'd done that because we didn't want the kids to

408
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
go to camp and everybody's saying, they gave to the swimming pool.

409
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And so it's never been named or anything.

410
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But we didn't want the kids to know.

411
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So did your family always have a swimming pool?

412
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes.

413
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think your kids were growing up.

414
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
At least when Kermit and I, we always had a swimming pool.

415
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Of course my dad didn't because he supported the 4-H1, but he didn't support family.

416
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But we did have a pond out in the woods that we could use in the summer time.

417
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But Kermit was, I think, did I tell you about him building that swimming pool?

418
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
No.

419
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Well, when we built our house over on Jackson Street, we didn't have a swimming pool.

420
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And so he came home one day and he said, well, what would you think?

421
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If we built a swimming pool across on the property across the way that we owned.

422
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And he said, I could bring in 12-12 timbers and put them together in the corners.

423
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And then we could put your paper down for the paint job.

424
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And then put plastic around it.

425
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And it would be 4 feet deep.

426
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I said, well, I think that would be great because the kids were little.

427
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And they could have a lot of fun and it was just like a big pool pool.

428
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So we did that.

429
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And I think that lasted for probably five or six years.

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Every year we tear it down and re-put your paper and plastic.

431
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And it would last the summer.

432
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And then we decided we built a swimming pool.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So we did that.

434
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But it wasn't covered.

435
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And so that wasn't very satisfactory in Oregon.

436
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So when he closed the mail, he came to me and he said, I've got to take the metal off the roof of some of the machinery that are in the mail.

437
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And he said, if we cleaned it up and cut off the end or the logs of hit it, he said, I could bring that metal in.

438
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And we could have a building over the pool.

439
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And I said, no, thank you.

440
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I don't want a metal building in my yard.

441
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And he said, well, now just wait a minute.

442
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
How tell you about how we're going to do this?

443
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's better than you think.

444
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So anyway, the back part of it was all metal.

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And then we put boards that was a very nice awning over the front of it.

446
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But then was all wood.

447
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And then we had sliding glass doors.

448
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And from the street, you couldn't tell what it was.

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's still there.

450
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And covered over the whole pool.

451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's interesting.

452
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And we built a sink and a bathroom out there.

453
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And a blazing girl's breast dressing rooms.

454
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Wow.

455
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And it was really a nice little.

456
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And of course, we entertained all the kids.

457
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And on the camp, our girls, the blazing house.

458
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Our kids whoever came around.

459
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
This was wonderful because the kids were at our house.

460
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And we knew what they were doing.

461
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And so it was just a wonderful pool.

462
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And the kids all the time they were growing up.

463
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's great.

464
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And so that's still a use over there.

465
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh yeah.

466
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So that's good.

467
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, that sort of leads me to my, I wanted to ask a little bit about

468
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Kermit's community involvement.

469
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Because I know it sounds like he was also involved in the scouts to a certain event.

470
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes.

471
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yes, it was with the scouts in Eugene.

472
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I don't know what level of scouting that was.

473
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Whatever it was.

474
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He used to go to Eugene to meetings with boy scouts.

475
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And it was very active.

476
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And he did a lot of fundraising for the boy scouts.

477
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And he always said that he didn't like to ask people from money.

478
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But because of his relationship with the mill, there were lots of times when he had

479
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
partial lots of something that he couldn't really sell.

480
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But they were very usable.

481
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So he would donate those.

482
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He liked in kind giving.

483
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And he got confused for the boy scouts.

484
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And he would ask various people who manufactured things.

485
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
If he thought the scouts could use it like then he and that burned very well.

486
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And in fact, I still do that a lot with my fundraising.

487
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We try to get in time to gifts.

488
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Interesting.

489
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because people don't mind giving things that they've manufactured.

490
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And those canoes were perfectly good.

491
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But maybe they had a chip out of the paint or something.

492
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They couldn't sell them.

493
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But they were perfectly usable.

494
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Interesting.

495
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

496
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's a great service to provide.

497
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yes.

498
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's a rope or those heels on it.

499
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Giving was his thing.

500
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Interesting.

501
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
He was also involved with the rotary and other groups around town.

502
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes.

503
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He was a Rotarian.

504
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And after he died, I made him a fellow when the rotary club.

505
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He was really fond of the rotary group.

506
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Were there some things that he was particularly involved with things that were close to him?

507
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I don't remember that he was in particularly involved with rotary.

508
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But he may have been more than I realized I don't know.

509
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah.

510
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But he was involved in the church.

511
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah.

512
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He was a justi of the church.

513
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

514
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
He did that.

515
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And he wasn't a joiner.

516
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Really.

517
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
He didn't like to join.

518
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Very much really.

519
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So he did his work on the outskirts.

520
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yes.

521
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That works that well.

522
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Another thing I have on list of your credits is the E.E. Wilson Foundation.

523
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What's been your involvement there?

524
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, I was on that for a number of years.

525
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And the Fred Zoolawon was head of that.

526
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And managed it from the very beginning when E.E. Wilson died.

527
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I knew E.E. Wilson.

528
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And so I guess they thought that I would be interested in managing what he had given to the college.

529
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And what really wasn't to the college.

530
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It was just, I think it was kind of just given.

531
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But he had to have a board managing it.

532
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And Pete Smith lived next door to us over on Jackson.

533
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And he was on the board.

534
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And so then he got me involved.

535
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And I was on that for a number of years.

536
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Is that managing the lens?

537
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No, the money that was in the bank that was accumulating interest and so forth.

538
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And the duty of the board was to have kids apply for that for money from that.

539
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And then we had to read their applications and decide who was going to get what?

540
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So scholarships.

541
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes.

542
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
For OSU?

543
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes.

544
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Well, it could be.

545
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
As I remember it, it could be any kind of forgotten.

546
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I think it's any Oregon school.

547
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And that scholarship is still available.

548
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yes, it is.

549
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes, it is.

550
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And present value.

551
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yes.

552
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And it seems to me like it has to be Benton County youth.

553
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I could be.

554
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I think it is.

555
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, that was a long time ago when I served on that.

556
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I see you haven't done that for a while.

557
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
No.

558
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So most recently, the things that you're still involved in.

559
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Are you still involved in forage?

560
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Or the economic sit-up?

561
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
No.

562
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm still, I serve on the advisory committee for the home and the library.

563
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And the hospital is an honorary trustee and the museum of Benton County Museum.

564
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's a lot of responsibilities.

565
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Well, I've quit just recently.

566
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I've quit the museum and I've quit the library.

567
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So I'm down to the hospital and the health and human science.

568
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And you've quit them just to give yourself a little more free time?

569
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes.

570
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

571
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's just too much.

572
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It is.

573
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But it's an incredible gift to the community.

574
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Do you think that as you were talking about how, you know, you had a good year in the

575
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
future?

576
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Do you think that's still going on at that same level in the stay and age?

577
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's the same sense of philanthropy that people of your era had?

578
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No.

579
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't think so.

580
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I think everything now is based on what I can do to get rid of the money for tax purposes.

581
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I really think that people give to get their tax off.

582
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And of course, I've always believed that I would like to give money to something where

583
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I know it's going then to taxes.

584
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So I try to give as much as I can and not have to pay tax on it.

585
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah.

586
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But it seems like your choice of beneficiaries has a lot to do with your personal interests.

587
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yes.

588
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, yes.

589
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Absolutely.

590
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's your own home.

591
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yes.

592
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Your personal involved not only in terms of giving money, but also in giving a expertise

593
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
at advice.

594
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

595
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah.

596
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Because I want to know what they're doing with the money.

597
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I think that makes you different than some other donors too in some ways.

598
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh, probably a lot of people give money.

599
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And then they've done, you know, they don't pay attention.

600
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But I really like to know what they're doing with it.

601
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Absolutely.

602
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah.

603
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The one big organization that you've given to is OSU.

604
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We haven't talked about that at all.

605
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'd love to hear more about your involvement there and all the things that you've contributed

606
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I know a lot of it has been real fundraising for various real estate ventures.

607
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Uh-huh.

608
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Isn't that true?

609
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Well, I think that when you know a lot of all of this stuff that goes on is who you know.

610
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Mm-hmm.

611
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And I'm really proud of the fact that there were three ships available are fishing vessels.

612
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I should say, available in Newport.

613
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And I had become very friendly with Bruce made in his life, Mary-Doo.

614
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And his mother, because they wanted me to go on a trip.

615
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And his mother needed a roommate.

616
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So I said, well, I would go and room with her.

617
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Well, we just got along fine and we just became really good friends over Newport.

618
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So anyway, the more I heard about what Bruce made was doing.

619
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I was very impressed with what he does and his science that he's promoted with whales.

620
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So anyway, there were some, when the fishing industry over there went kind of went

621
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to compute by there were three men who wanted to donate their boats to as you for research.

622
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Mm-hmm.

623
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, the trustees, who were the people who say yes or no, there's a little, you know, bored.

624
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Mm-hmm.

625
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They didn't know what did they do about Bruce made, never heard of him, didn't know anything about him.

626
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well, I had followed him because he's on BBC and he's on history channels and all of those things.

627
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And he was doing great things about tagging whales so that they knew where they were going and what they were doing.

628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And so John Irving was one of the men who was trying to get the board, the Moes U board, to accept these ships because he thought it was a great thing for them to be able to re-retrofit them and get them fixed for research.

629
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Well, so far, they've only done one, but they're available, but anyway, backing up, he called me one day and he said,

630
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
would I be willing to speak to the trustees about Bruce made?

631
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I said, oh, I'd love to because I really think he does a good job.

632
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So anyway, I told him, I said, how many of you know Bruce the name Bruce made?

633
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So I proceeded to tell him who he was and what he'd done and what a wonderful research he was doing.

634
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So then they were all skitteries about insurance on these boats.

635
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But they finally worked it out with, I don't know who, but anyway, they accepted the three boats and I'm really proud of the fact that I kind of encouraged him to do this.

636
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Absolutely, yeah, but you know sometimes it's just who you know.

637
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's right, and having that personal touch.

638
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, I'm willing to be there and say, yeah, I know of this man and I can speak for him.

639
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That's right.

640
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And I can tell him a little bit about what he does.

641
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
His mother, I don't know whether you want to put anything about this in, but I think she's such a dear woman.

642
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
She's just a little short thing. She's probably not five feet tall.

643
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
She studied under Frank Lloyd Wright in some registered architect.

644
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
She studied a library of science and as a degree in whatever library is.

645
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And she's this one smart lady.

646
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
She's just there and has a wonderful sense of humor.

647
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Just enjoyed her knowing.

648
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, that's great.

649
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Unfortunately, now she's in a rest home in Newport.

650
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Doesn't have her mind very clear right now.

651
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
She's getting older.

652
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Some of the rest of it.

653
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So you've done some work as a lot of work through the foundation as well through the OSU foundation.

654
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Well, I'm on the OSU foundation.

655
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I wouldn't say I do much work.

656
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But I go.

657
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I see.

658
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So that's more of being a member of the board and not necessarily anything.

659
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah.

660
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Things that you're most proud of.

661
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah.

662
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No.

663
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
In fact, I'm not very proud of what they're doing right now.

664
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We won't put that in.

665
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
We won't, okay.

666
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
All right.

667
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You say so.

668
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Are there things that OSU that you look at and think?

669
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm so pleased to be on the both that you, that you got for Bruce's project.

670
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But are there other things there that you look at and think?

671
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm so glad to have been a contributor to this.

672
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, a library, of course.

673
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I think our library is just one of the nicest ones in the Northwest.

674
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's amazing.

675
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And I'm very supportive of Carol Butcher.

676
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I think she does some very innovative things.

677
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The most recent one that she's done is having that baby sitting.

678
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
She has an area that she has and the students can come and bring.

679
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
If they're studying in the library, they have to stay in the library.

680
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But if they're studying, they can bring their children.

681
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And let them off at this little care center.

682
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And they're given, I think, like you get in restaurants.

683
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You know, when you're younger.

684
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What?

685
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So kind of a beeper?

686
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes, a beeper.

687
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And so if they need them, they can be the mother.

688
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And her father was a case maybe.

689
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
These days.

690
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And I think that's quite innovative.

691
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I didn't know about that.

692
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes, it's quite a nice project.

693
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Sure.

694
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
They have a loop.

695
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
They've done some interesting things with the plumbing because, of course,

696
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
they needed to toilet.

697
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And it's a little really nice little part of party.

698
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And so they didn't put in actual plumbing.

699
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But I think it's very well designed.

700
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And they have students in there that are learning child care.

701
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Oh, nice.

702
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I think it's just a great project.

703
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'll have to check that out.

704
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah.

705
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Perfect.

706
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Well, and you're such a beaver fan.

707
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, yes, I'm a beaver.

708
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That should definitely be in there, too, I think.

709
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, you know, since I've lived in Corvallus all my life,

710
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
there's no, you know, I had three out of my four children go through Oregon state.

711
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So where, and my husband was a graduate of Oregon state.

712
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And I've worked for the college through the extension service.

713
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And, you know, we've just been involved in the university all our lives.

714
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah.

715
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And of course, my father worked at the university.

716
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And, you know, you're just kind of all, that's where your life is being.

717
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's right. Yeah.

718
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But I love the fact that you still go to the football games.

719
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, that football game, Saturday night was something.

720
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's like they're doing so well this year.

721
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He was just so proud.

722
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But all the officiating was, was it just terrible?

723
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And even Mike Riley, who calls the games for the radio.

724
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
He said it was the worst officiating he'd ever seen in his life.

725
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's a statement.

726
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yes.

727
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And the paper, I think Riley asked him to downplay it probably.

728
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But he's a very low-key guy.

729
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But boy was he upset with the officiating.

730
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
He called one of the players.

731
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You know, an ask him to read through it.

732
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Really?

733
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And they didn't change it.

734
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So, yeah, it was a feisty game.

735
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Good. Good.

736
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And you still go to those with your family?

737
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yes.

738
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
In fact, I did go with my daughter in son-in-law this time.

739
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I always sometimes I use tickets for guests.

740
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I like to entertain that way.

741
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Because I have the tickets.

742
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I might as well use them for something.

743
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's right.

744
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Your support of the sports angle of the OSU in general.

745
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It seems like that's a particular emphasis for you.

746
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yes.

747
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And I really like basketball better.

748
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I go to all the basketball games.

749
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You're not doing very well on basketball this year.

750
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But of course, when Ralph Miller was there,

751
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
why it was just what you're full.

752
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, that's good.

753
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So, are there any other projects that you think you'd like to talk about in here

754
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or things that you're particularly proud of?

755
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, I guess I'm particularly proud of my kids.

756
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, that's it.

757
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I would love to get back to that because we sort of talked about their younger life

758
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
when we were here a couple of weeks ago.

759
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But I'd like to hear about them today and what you,

760
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
what's your most proud of each of them.

761
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Well, Kenzy oldest.

762
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And he lives in Southern California.

763
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And he has two sons.

764
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And the grandchildren are doing most,

765
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
most welcome there.

766
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The Derek is his oldest son.

767
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And he's married to Mindy.

768
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And they have three children now.

769
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And they're, she's a,

770
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I don't think all that school.

771
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Montessori school teacher and has a school in their home.

772
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And Derek is very handy.

773
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And he's made a doll house and he's made slides and he's made.

774
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
They have half their yard for the school and half the yard for their own private.

775
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And the kids know when they come that they don't go on that side of the yard.

776
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
But they just do a whale of a job.

777
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They're, they're growing up to be such fine young people.

778
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's wonderful.

779
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And I'm very proud of them.

780
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And my Ken lives in a,

781
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I don't know what Ken does.

782
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And he's on the,

783
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
the California Water Board.

784
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
He does something about that.

785
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He's also done something with hazardous waste.

786
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
He's been on committees about that.

787
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Is he an engineer?

788
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
No, he really isn't.

789
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
He's a, he was a business major.

790
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
He started out as being a forest major.

791
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But he, every time he went to class, he,

792
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
a field trip, he had poison open.

793
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So he had to give that up.

794
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And so he was a business major.

795
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And then he got his MBA.

796
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And something.

797
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But he's, he's dabbled in a lot of things.

798
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And he lives in on 10 acres in an avocado grove.

799
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And raises those great big avocado.

800
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh, yes.

801
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's a great.

802
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's a good.

803
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And just then.

804
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And his wife is a psychologist.

805
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And the children all call her the shrink.

806
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That's great.

807
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And their second son.

808
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And the second one was in the military.

809
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
What's his name?

810
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Danny.

811
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Danny.

812
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And he was in the military for about 10 years.

813
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I think in Mary to really nice girl.

814
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And they have two children.

815
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And he's out of the military now.

816
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And taking a lot of mechanics.

817
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And well, I guess you'd say mechanics,

818
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
because I think it's a combination of auto and airplane.

819
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
A lot of mechanics.

820
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
He likes to work with his hands.

821
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So he does that.

822
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Then Craig's the next boy.

823
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And he lives in Bend.

824
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And he does.

825
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Well, I don't know what Craig does.

826
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
He runs some sort of a business called bad checks.

827
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And he takes checks that are bouncing.

828
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And does something with him.

829
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And I've never been able to figure out what he does.

830
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But anyway, he does that.

831
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And then he's a hunter and a fisherman.

832
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And seems to earn enough money to play quite a bit.

833
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And he also has some friends who are quite wealthy.

834
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And he goes with them.

835
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Because Craig's a fun guy.

836
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And he has children as well.

837
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yes, he has two.

838
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And one is going to school here at LBCC.

839
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And is going to be.

840
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
She's studying to be a.

841
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Well, I don't know what she's studying to be.

842
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Anyway, she's going to school.

843
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That's her name.

844
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Tracy.

845
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And then McKinsey goes to.

846
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Scared, which is Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia.

847
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And she's studying jewelry.

848
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And she apparently is very good because.

849
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
She just designed some piece that the teacher is taking to Hong Kong to show.

850
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And some group there over there.

851
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Wow.

852
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I guess it's quite a thing in her body.

853
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:36,000
She has been thinking that she would like to buy a Savannah house.

854
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You know, an antique house of some sort.

855
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And have a store below.

856
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
A jewelry store below.

857
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And have a book above.

858
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So she's got her life all figured out.

859
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Then there's Kathy, who lives in Portland, K-A-T-H-Y.

860
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And she's married to me, Clifford.

861
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And which is kind of interesting.

862
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Because you know, we have a man over here who was Clifford.

863
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Mead.

864
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Thank you.

865
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Thank you.

866
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And the, you know, a line is falling.

867
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And it's straight to the earthy.

868
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Mead.

869
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So anyway, you got to be careful with which way you got.

870
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And he was a man who, man.

871
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
He called it.

872
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I don't think all that business.

873
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Anyway, it was starring hospital records.

874
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And he built that up to a very big business.

875
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And then all of a sudden Iron Mountain came in.

876
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And they were an international company.

877
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And they bought him out.

878
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So he does some other things now.

879
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Did they have children?

880
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yes, they have three.

881
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And it's the oldest one is brand.

882
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And he goes to school at, oh, I can't tell you.

883
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's, it's, it's one of the California schools.

884
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's, it's San Diego.

885
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's the Catholic school.

886
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
That's in San Diego up on the hill.

887
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm going to bed up.

888
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Very petite.

889
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
There's prestigious school.

890
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But I, I never know whether it's the university.

891
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
No, I don't think it's got university.

892
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And because it's a private, it's a Catholic school.

893
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They are Catholic.

894
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But he wanted to go to some place where he could wear flip-flops and shorts.

895
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
He found it.

896
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So he's, and he's, I'm going to graduate this year.

897
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And he thinks he's going to go to law school.

898
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Great.

899
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And then Colin is the high school senior.

900
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I don't know what I'm going to do about.

901
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Graduation this year.

902
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
We've got all these kids graduating.

903
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm a Kinsey of graduate from SCAD.

904
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Um, we're going to graduate from California.

905
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Colin's going to graduate from Lincoln High School.

906
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Uh-huh.

907
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah.

908
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
How do you know?

909
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
How do you know?

910
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I always.

911
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You don't have to map it out with that.

912
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
What's the calendar?

913
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Um, so, and that's Colin.

914
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And he goes to Lincoln High School.

915
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
What is interesting, you know?

916
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Um, well, the poor kid.

917
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
He's had health problems.

918
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And he wants to be an athlete.

919
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But he, he, just had these tonsils out.

920
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And it was a real brutal operation.

921
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
He was in the hospital for two or three days.

922
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Was tonsils.

923
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
He and he don't hear about it.

924
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah.

925
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But they say that when you're older and you have your tonsils out,

926
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
it's real rough.

927
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And it was.

928
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
He just had a few days there of being miserable.

929
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Um, so I don't know.

930
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Uh, what Colin will, will be interested in.

931
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Um, he's looking at schools now.

932
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Um, and then there's no bread.

933
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Who is, um, interested in nothing but look across.

934
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
He said bread was the oldest.

935
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yes.

936
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Then Colin and then Brent.

937
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
No, Brent.

938
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I see.

939
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I got to Brent somehow.

940
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Oh, who is it?

941
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
No.

942
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The, um, oh, I'm sorry.

943
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Okay.

944
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Grant is what I meant.

945
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Grant is the oldest.

946
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Okay.

947
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Colin and then Brent.

948
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Brent.

949
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Great.

950
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Alright.

951
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And Grant's look across.

952
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, that's his.

953
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
He leaves, sleeps, eats everything across.

954
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,360
And I guess he's a pretty good little player because he was chosen as one of two in the

955
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,000
part and district to, wow, represent the teams that play.

956
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
He's played in Philadelphia.

957
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And this is a middle school.

958
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Huh?

959
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Oh, he's still in middle school.

960
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
That's amazing.

961
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And he played in Philadelphia.

962
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And he played in Seattle.

963
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And he played in Southern California.

964
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I understand that.

965
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I think that's too much for middle school kids.

966
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Oh, yeah.

967
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But that's what they do these days.

968
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, yes.

969
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It sure is.

970
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And I guess he's pretty darn good.

971
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So that's his passion.

972
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And there's, didn't there's Kim.

973
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Uh-huh.

974
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
She's the baby.

975
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And she's married to Walt.

976
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And she and Walt are now doing the courtyard.

977
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You know, do you know about the courtyard?

978
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah.

979
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And that's rebel ones.

980
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Rebel, rebel ones.

981
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Something like that they call it.

982
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And they've been working really hard to get these students.

983
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So we get it.

984
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
If fixed up so that students could live there,

985
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
who was in terrible shape.

986
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Hmm.

987
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And they've got 14 students living there.

988
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And they're the nicest young people.

989
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
They have to be kind of religiously oriented.

990
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Not any particular denomination, just.

991
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And they're all enthusiastic about where they live.

992
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're spreading the word.

993
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And Kim said, by next year they'll have a waiting list.

994
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I'm sure.

995
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah.

996
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So are they living here in town while they were here?

997
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yes.

998
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
They live out at the end of 29th Street.

999
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Great.

1000
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Otherwise did she live in Portland before?

1001
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yes.

1002
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Has she lived completely down here?

1003
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And yes.

1004
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Walt's been an interesting husband.

1005
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
He was an FFA boy.

1006
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Uh-huh.

1007
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And he went with when he finished college.

1008
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
He had six screen houses and ran a nursery.

1009
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Hmm.

1010
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Took up to Carter culture in in college.

1011
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Hmm.

1012
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But he's gone through.

1013
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Oh, he worked for a rubber company.

1014
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And he worked for.

1015
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Uh, he's always landed on his feet with a very good job.

1016
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Hmm.

1017
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And, um, but now they're deciding that they'll do this.

1018
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So.

1019
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Who knows what they're doing.

1020
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Uh-huh.

1021
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And she was a teacher.

1022
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Kim?

1023
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yes, uh-huh.

1024
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
You know, she was trained as a teacher.

1025
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
She's not doing that anymore.

1026
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
No.

1027
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
She's working with Walt.

1028
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I'm with Rev.

1029
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Once.

1030
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Okay.

1031
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
She was substituting when they lived in Portland.

1032
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Uh-huh.

1033
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Great.

1034
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And they have twin daughters.

1035
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Uh-huh.

1036
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Uh-huh.

1037
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Jennifer and Kristen.

1038
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Hmm.

1039
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And, um.

1040
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Kristen is, um.

1041
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Uh.

1042
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
She graduated from.

1043
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
See how specific.

1044
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Hmm.

1045
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Hmm.

1046
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And, um, in, um, business.

1047
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And has a job in Portland with a computer company that she, um, hates her job.

1048
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That's good money.

1049
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And Jennifer has, um, graduated in home economics.

1050
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
We'll help the human science.

1051
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Uh-huh.

1052
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
And, uh, has a job in Portland that she just loves.

1053
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But doesn't make much money.

1054
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Uh-huh.

1055
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's so often it has to trade off.

1056
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
But it's fun that she's continuing on in the home economics field.

1057
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Well, no.

1058
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
She, she manages, um, an office for some brokers.

1059
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh, she does.

1060
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
She has their degree, but she doesn't use it.

1061
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
No.

1062
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh.

1063
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
No.

1064
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Well, it's still that she has the same interest that you did in home economics.

1065
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's nice that you share that.

1066
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Well, yes.

1067
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
She, she did.

1068
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And she worked a lot in kids' spirit when she was here.

1069
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Uh-huh.

1070
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And school.

1071
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
She worked at kids' spirit almost all the time.

1072
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
She was here.

1073
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah.

1074
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So, um, it's wonderful that you can even name all these girls and children and talk about each of them individually.

1075
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Did you spend a lot of time with them when they were growing up?

1076
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, more so with kids, children and the rest of them because they were in Portland.

1077
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And, um, well, I spent time with, with Kathy's children when they were younger.

1078
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But, uh, I don't drive to Portland anymore.

1079
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So, I don't see them nearly as often as I used to.

1080
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Uh-huh.

1081
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
But I know they stay in touch just from the fact that last time I was here one of somebody called

1082
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
maybe one of your California grandchildren.

1083
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh, golden.

1084
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh, yeah.

1085
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
They all call.

1086
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
We would wonder.

1087
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
We think cell phones are just great.

1088
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That's good.

1089
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah.

1090
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Did, um, what were some of the things that you did with them when you could get, get to spend

1091
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
time with them?

1092
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Well, we, we shopped a lot.

1093
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And, uh, they, they love to shop with grandma because, you know, who's by semester.

1094
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yeah.

1095
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Like, is there the same?

1096
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And, um, um, but we, we did a lot of things together.

1097
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
We had a lot of picnics together.

1098
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Mm-hmm.

1099
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Um.

1100
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Did you ever share your cooking and sewing in those kind of skills with them?

1101
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well, not much, maybe, maybe making sugar cookies.

1102
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
They all like my sugar cookies.

1103
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And, uh, this holiday, I'm taking the rolls and the sugar cookies for my part of the

1104
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Thanksgiving dinner.

1105
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Wow.

1106
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That's good.

1107
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And last night, Craig said, I said something about boy.

1108
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It would take me a long time to make rolls.

1109
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I said, I just thought as fast as I used to be.

1110
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And he said, well, don't worry about the rolls.

1111
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Just bring the sugar cookies.

1112
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Kind of priorities, that's a good thing.

1113
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's kind of a thing that I'm noted for.

1114
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's good.

1115
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Uh, did you have that experience of, um, just finding out how much fun it was to be a grand

1116
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
parent with, you know, enjoying your time with them and not having quite as much of the work

1117
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
as you do when you're a parent?

1118
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Well, I loved it when Kim had her twins because she lived in Lebanon at that time.

1119
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Uh-huh.

1120
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And, uh, and Walt was still doing the nursery.

1121
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Mm-hmm.

1122
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And, um, so when Walt, when she and Walt were married, uh, she had another year

1123
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
to school.

1124
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
She was married when she was a junior and, and Walt was a senior.

1125
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And, um, but her daddy had said, I don't mind you getting married, but he said, you're

1127
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
going to finish school.

1128
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Mm-hmm.

1129
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Well, of course, what happened was that she got pregnant.

1130
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Uh-huh.

1131
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And then they found out they were having twins.

1132
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And, of course, in the meantime, he died.

1133
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And so, anyway, I said, you know you promised your daddy that, if you got married

1134
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and she said, I know.

1135
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,000
So, anyway, um, they, I said, my advice to you is to get busy and she only had her

1136
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
doing teaching to do.

1137
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Mm-hmm.

1138
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And I said, you need to do that before your kids get mobile.

1139
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I said, it's a lot easier to take care of them when they're in the, in the, in, not

1140
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
wandering around.

1141
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And Walt was home during the day because he was running the nursery.

1142
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So, if there was an emergency, he was there.

1143
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah.

1144
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So, that worked out well.

1145
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,000
So, anyway, Kim was able to get a, um, student teaching situation in Lebanon.

1146
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Mm-hmm.

1147
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
So, uh, she wasn't far away.

1148
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And so, she finished up and got her degree while she was doing that.

1149
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Mm-hmm.

1150
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And then, um, then, uh, but I was over there a lot, taking care of the youngsters.

1151
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And they'd have, um, full-time help, but, um, it was, um, you know, I, I like to go over there

1152
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and help feed the kids.

1153
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I can imagine.

1154
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I can imagine.

1155
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
She was a great mother.

1156
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
She, uh, twins didn't bother Canada.

1157
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
She, I can still see her sitting on the dad important one.

1158
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Baby would be laying over there.

1159
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And she'd be feeding this one and that one would be yelling.

1160
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Uh-huh.

1161
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
She'd pat him on the back and say, no, it's your turn.

1162
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Uh-huh.

1163
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
She was a wonderful mother.

1164
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Okay.

1165
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Mm-hmm.

1166
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Good.

1167
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So, with that last time when I was here, you got that phone call.

1168
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You were going to be sending down, um, one of your boys jackets to one of your great grandkids.

1169
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yes.

1170
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Yes.

1171
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And I did that.

1172
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And he's absolutely ecstatic.

1173
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
That is so sweet.

1174
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yeah.

1175
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Yeah.

1176
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So, this one, uh, was a red, flannel, well, boy scout jacket.

1177
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I don't know that you know, but that's quite a deal when they get back.

1178
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yeah.

1179
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And then they, they put all their patches on.

1180
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Mm-hmm.

1181
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And so, this one was all covered in patches.

1182
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And so, I said, to Ken, my son, I said, what do you think I ought to do with these patches?

1183
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And he said, well, I take him off because he needs to earn his own patches.

1184
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1185
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So he, uh, so anyway, I'm got them all in a little Ziploc bag.

1186
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And I'm taking him over to Craig, who earned the patches.

1187
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And then I sent the coat to the cleaners.

1188
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And it's been sent down to, yeah, to, um, what's he saying?

1189
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And those guys down.

1190
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Uh, let's see.

1191
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I didn't get the name of the great grandchildren, I guess.

1192
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Derek or Danny's kids, huh?

1193
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Yeah.

1194
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Well, it's Derek's kids.

1195
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Um, well, anyway, whoever's getting it.

1196
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And, um, and he said, so Ken called me and he said, boy, is he one happy boy?

1197
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh.

1198
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
He said he was just crazy about.

1199
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And you know, it looked brand new and it got back from the cleaners.

1200
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It was just great.

1201
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
That's fine.

1202
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It kind of fluffed up all of those sewing that would have been on it.

1203
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Uh-huh.

1204
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
We're down just really well.

1205
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's good.

1206
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Good.

1207
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Why are there other things that you have that you saved from when you were a little girl

1208
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that you would have been able to pass on to your grandchildren that they've enjoyed?

1209
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Well, I don't really think of anything off hand.

1210
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Um, uh, oh, no, I don't.

1211
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,000
The only thing that I have saved really of Kathy's is that she made a dress with beautiful

1212
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
satin stitch.

1213
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And I could show that to you.

1214
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It, uh, and it, um, I think it's a real special little dress.

1215
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And it's been hanging back there for 20 years just because I enjoy looking at it.

1216
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Uh-huh.

1217
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Do you want to see it?

1218
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'd love to.

1219
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Well, let's wait till we're done.

1220
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Unless you need to get up and stretch a little bit.

1221
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
No, no.

1222
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm just stretching my legs out.

1223
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We're doing here for time.

1224
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Two, three.

1225
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Should we plan to stop at three again?

1226
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's two.

1227
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's 20 minutes to three now.

1228
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I have to be fine.

1229
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Okay.

1230
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
All right.

1231
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Let's see.

1232
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And then we're just about three or four.

1233
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
We are.

1234
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think this will be our last form.

1235
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
We'll get together.

1236
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Uh-huh.

1237
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I want to keep open the possibility of giving you a call if while I'm putting this together.

1238
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Yes.

1239
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Absolutely.

1240
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I understand.

1241
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So I had some sort of general questions that are more or less reflections on life and

1242
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and could tell me if you're comfortable answering these kinds of things.

1243
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But I like to have a little bit of people's philosophy in these books too.

1244
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Because I feel like what you're leaving in with this book is a statement of your legacy.

1245
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
There's so much about your death legacy out there.

1246
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And I think, well, Gene has a legacy of her on this.

1247
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
She's leaving here.

1248
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Do you have a sense of what you want your legacy to be, what you think your children

1249
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and your community should remember about you?

1250
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I hope those are hard things to answer.

1251
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I should have given you these questions in advance.

1252
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Yeah.

1253
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Because I just hope that people remember that I try to live by the golden rule.

1254
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I guess it's my philosophy.

1255
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'd like to have people treat me like I want to be treated and I want to treat them.

1256
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And I've always kind of lived by that, hopefully by that philosophy that I don't know

1257
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:49,000
really what else to say about that is I want to feel like I'm all I'm on this earth

1258
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
that I'm contributing something to society.

1259
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And I guess that that's why I like to get out and do things and I don't want to just set.

1260
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Right.

1261
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Do you stay active?

1262
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
We haven't talked about knitting either, Henry.

1263
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'd like to hear more of that.

1264
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
That's one of my hobbies.

1265
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You've shown me, and you actually told me that you got started on that back when you were in high school

1266
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
when you were waiting for your dad to pick you up.

1267
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Right.

1268
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
This piece is coming along nicely, though, are you getting close to the end of it?

1269
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah, so I'm getting like close to the end of it.

1270
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Just love the colors that you chose for that.

1271
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
This is for Colin.

1272
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Uh-huh.

1273
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And I've been busy.

1274
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I've been busy.

1275
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The end there.

1276
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Oh, John.

1277
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I'm losing something.

1278
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Not quite.

1279
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I'm hit an African for each one of the children.

1280
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Most of them, at least the ones that have asked for it.

1282
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Uh-huh.

1283
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And so he's a big boy and so.

1284
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,000
He wanted something heavy and his mother wanted something that he wouldn't put his toes through.

1285
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
They'd play.

1286
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Uh-huh.

1287
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And so that's for that.

1288
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
But this one is.

1289
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And you know, we might take a picture of that one time.

1290
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Because I'm most proud of this African.

1291
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Can I?

1292
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Can I?

1293
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It's the one that I did.

1294
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, I was waiting for him when he was a football player.

1295
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Uh-huh.

1296
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I mean, most of this under a street light.

1297
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Waiting in your car?

1298
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Well, he was impressed.

1299
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah.

1300
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's gorgeous.

1301
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And I'm a variety of stitches in this one.

1302
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So I'm really pleased with this one.

1303
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Now how did you end up with that?

1304
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
If you needed it for him.

1305
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Oh, I didn't need it for him.

1306
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Oh, just.

1307
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Why?

1308
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Oh, he was.

1309
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
He was playing.

1310
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh, I did it for myself.

1311
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It's just gorgeous.

1312
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Well, I don't want to sample her, isn't it?

1313
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
With all the.

1314
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yes, it is.

1315
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You're trying to stitching it.

1316
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But I've never, I don't know how many of these.

1317
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I knit one for Uncle Norm.

1318
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
That was my husband's brother.

1319
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Uh-huh.

1320
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And he, I had a real hard time.

1321
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
He, they were when he was getting older.

1322
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
He, they just kind of chopped him in pieces.

1323
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
He, he lost a leg.

1324
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Uh-huh.

1325
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And, you know, an arm.

1326
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Do you have diabetes?

1327
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
No.

1328
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't know what he had.

1329
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So long time ago when I forgot what he had.

1330
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But anyway, he, um, he needed to blank it to keep warm.

1331
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
He didn't have very good circulation.

1332
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So I did him one and I didn't.

1333
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I don't know how many afters I did.

1334
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I might take a picture of that one too before I leave here.

1335
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Well, that would, I'd love to have a picture of that to put in the book as well.

1336
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Well, I think I'm real proud of this.

1337
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Wow, that's really gorgeous.

1338
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I think it's probably the fanciest one that I've got.

1339
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Uh-huh.

1340
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And I do needle point.

1341
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Uh-huh.

1342
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
That's a needle point.

1343
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
One that I did.

1344
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Which one?

1345
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
That one.

1346
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
The pillow?

1347
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Mm-hmm.

1348
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Beautiful.

1349
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I love the colors.

1351
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I have a couple of the beach that I've done in shells.

1352
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Uh-huh.

1353
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
That sort of thing.

1354
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Ooh.

1355
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Can I have good eyes for that project?

1356
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Yeah.

1357
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Tiny little stitches.

1358
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I did all of it except the border and I got to the point where I just couldn't do those fine stitches.

1359
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Uh-huh.

1360
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It was pink on the background too and I couldn't see where I'd been and where I was going.

1361
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah.

1362
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So we'll finish it up for you.

1363
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But Kathy, she does.

1364
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Uh-huh.

1365
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
She does beautiful needle point.

1366
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Uh-huh.

1367
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:57,000
She's-my-she has inherited more of my clothing and textiles.

1368
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Uh-huh.

1369
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
A bill of tea.

1370
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yeah.

1371
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And anybody else?

1372
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Uh-huh.

1373
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Can it doesn't like to do that much?

1374
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Uh-huh.

1375
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So, um...

1376
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You've been a single woman for quite a long time.

1377
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Uh-huh.

1378
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm sure that has its challenges, but are there parts of that that have been good for you

1379
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
that have helped you to grow?

1380
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
As a...

1381
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Well, I think, um...

1382
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Kermin and I never got to travel very much.

1383
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Uh-huh.

1384
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Uh-huh.

1385
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
We did have that one lovely trip to Japan.

1386
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
But I think we talked about and how we happened to go to Japan and so forth.

1387
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Uh-huh.

1388
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Uh-huh.

1389
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
When, uh, this Uncle Norm died, my sister-in-law.

1390
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And I traveled quite a bit.

1391
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
We probably went on five or six lovely trips.

1392
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And we traveled in Europe a lot.

1393
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Um, because, uh, my husband never wanted to go to Europe.

1394
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:05,000
There was something about the World War II that he just didn't want to go to Europe.

1395
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Um, but, um, but we did go, um, a lot to other parts of the world.

1396
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But anyway, um, Marie and I traveled quite a bit together.

1397
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And, um, I always enjoyed that.

1398
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And then, um, then when, uh, my brother died, well, I met my sister and I traveled quite

1399
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
a bit together.

1400
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So, um, I really enjoyed all of that very much.

1401
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So it kind of freed you up to have, uh, that kind of experience with other people.

1402
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Right.

1403
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Right.

1404
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And I had enough income then to support some travel.

1405
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So it worked out well.

1406
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah.

1407
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah.

1408
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Um, when you're, when you're, you're traveling, you're sort of seeing the world.

1409
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And, uh, seeing how other, other people live, are there, are there parts of that whole

1410
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Traveling thing that really appealed to you?

1411
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Well, of course, Hawaii is my favorite place.

1412
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yeah.

1413
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Because it's, uh, clean.

1414
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
They speak English.

1415
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And money's the same.

1416
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Uh-huh.

1417
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah.

1418
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's easy.

1419
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And, uh, of course, the weather's always good.

1420
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And I, I don't remember who didn't be talk about Betty and I owning a condominium over there.

1421
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
No.

1422
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Although I saw that somewhere else, and I meant to ask you about that.

1423
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So you have a condominium together?

1424
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
We did.

1425
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Uh-huh.

1426
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Well, you don't have it anymore.

1427
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
No.

1428
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Well, of course, she's gone.

1429
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
She's gone for several years.

1430
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But, um, we were, um, she had Alzheimer's.

1431
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And, uh, when we decided that we wanted to do this condominium together, we said that we were just going to let the family use it.

1432
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Mm-hmm.

1433
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Well, all of a sudden, I began to hear people were thinking me for going to hear stay in my condominium.

1434
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Uh-huh.

1435
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Well, I thought that she was being a little bit presumptuous.

1436
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But it turned out that she, she really, you know, had not remembered that we had this understand.

1437
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Yeah.

1438
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And, uh, so anyway, I said that, uh, I didn't give her any reason why, but I just said that I thought that,

1439
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
that maybe I wasn't going to be interested in having the condominium anymore.

1440
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And she said, well, she'd buy me out.

1441
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So it was all very admirable, everything.

1442
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And then I realized a few years later that she just really wasn't herself.

1443
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Mm-hmm.

1444
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So it was okay.

1445
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah.

1446
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And my nephews just couldn't be nicer to me.

1447
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
They're just wonderful boys.

1448
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That's great.

1449
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So when you were in Hawaii, did you do that?

1450
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You said, uh, Kermit was a scuba diver early on.

1451
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Were you a scuba diver as well?

1452
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yes.

1453
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
He taught me how to scuba diver.

1454
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And, uh, we always went snorkeling.

1455
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Mm-hmm.

1456
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And, uh, and I would, I was, it is, um,

1457
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So, um, I wasn't, um, comfortable going by myself too much.

1458
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And so he would always take my hand and me go out together,

1459
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and look and then he'd say,

1460
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1461
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But Betty and I did a lot of that too because she liked to, to snarkle.

1462
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Huh.

1463
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So when we were, when we had our condominium,

1464
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
we would, uh, co-snarling almost everyday.

1465
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

1466
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
How long did you have it together?

1467
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
About three years.

1468
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Uh-huh.

1469
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
That's great.

1470
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Good.

1471
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And I think most of the kids had it once or twice.

1472
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,600
their twice. They all went over once or twice. They were at the age where they didn't have

1473
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:15,840
a lot of extra money for the fair over and along the staying and so they could manage it

1474
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:22,160
every once in a while but not too often. Sounds like a real treat. And you had taken them

1475
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,720
over quite a bit when they were younger. Yes, we had always gone over on spring break.

1476
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:32,960
That's a good thing. Good. You know, one thing we didn't talk about. I know that

1477
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,760
Kermit was involved in the church and you've always been involved with the church as well.

1478
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:45,920
Are you, do you consider yourself a spiritual person or? Well, I think I am. I'm more

1479
01:25:45,920 --> 01:26:00,560
of, um, I think I'm not a, I don't talk about religion too much. My, my daughter and

1480
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,880
son-in-law came in water. Very religious and they, they talk about it all the time and they

1481
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:16,960
pray before heels and that sort of thing. I'm more of a one who keeps their religion kind of to

1482
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:31,600
themselves. And my husband, I think I've got a lot of his feelings in me because he always said that

1483
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:38,320
if he dealt with some business man who broadcast his religion and had

1484
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:51,200
visible things on his desk that portrayed his religion. It just raised a red flag with him because he

1485
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:59,280
said, I know too many men who go to church every Sunday and just go back by two during the week.

1486
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:10,640
And I think I've inherited a lot of that feeling. I try to live by the golden rule, as I say.

1487
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,200
All right. Well, we have just about five more minutes and I think I can get limit us to maybe three

1488
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:24,640
questions. Okay. At that time, the other sort of big picture issue I wanted to ask you about

1489
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:31,200
whether they were any sort of social or political issues that that have been important to you

1490
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:40,240
as you've come through your life or anything that have been. Well, I, I am a firm believer that

1491
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:51,440
you should, what is it's about the babies and I think it should be between your husband and your

1492
01:27:51,440 --> 01:28:00,720
doctor and yourself. And I'm really myth that people can't see that that it's none of the

1493
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:08,640
government's business. It's a prochoice. Yeah, I'm sure I am. And have you ever been active in any

1494
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:17,520
of the kind of causes or just a personally healthy? I'm not in a cause person. That's good. You've

1495
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:25,920
been active in causes sort of in the back of your influence. Yeah, I think. And I guess the other thing

1496
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:38,800
is that in in church too that I feel that if you want to be a, what are you when you're

1497
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:47,440
lesbian, I guess. You know, the congregational churches of big on people being lesbian

1498
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:55,520
and I had to give up the congressional church even though with the my background is in the

1499
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:03,920
congregational church, but it's also in the Presbyterian church, but but I'm a Presbyterian now because

1500
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:13,680
I could, they, they hired a lady. I don't know the, remember this, but probably 10 maybe 15 years ago.

1501
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:20,560
A lady came and was part of the Presbyterian church and I think she was the Sunday school teacher

1502
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:28,640
that they, they hired the young people. And she thought that lesbians were just the best thing

1503
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:36,800
that ever happened to anybody. And she would have, when she first came, there was a picture of

1504
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:45,440
her in the paper almost every week about what she believed in and I thought I am just sick of that.

1505
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:55,440
And so I, the minister came to see me and I said, do you advertise what goes on in your bedroom?

1506
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,600
Well, no, and I said, well, I don't know why lesbians have to advertise that they're

1507
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:10,080
that persuasion. And so I said, I'm, I'm just not going to support the church until you change

1508
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:20,080
your rules. And so that's moved on from there now. Yeah, and it was more a matter of the,

1509
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:27,920
how public she was being about. Yes, yes. I don't care, the whole neck teachers over here have

1510
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,520
always lived together. But they haven't advertised what, and a lot of them were just doing it

1511
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:44,320
because they needed friendship, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that. But to advertise,

1512
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:52,080
you know how you feel about your personal, it just calls me. Yeah, that's, and I don't mind if you

1513
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,800
print that. All right, that's why it's an important stance, I think. I think that's good.

1514
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:06,400
If you had to pinpoint what's your, what's your grateful for in this life,

1515
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:11,600
you've talked so much about your family and things like that. Are there particular things that you

1516
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:18,960
think about how grateful you are to have had in your life? Yes, I think I'm grateful for the fact

1517
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:26,560
that I've had a good education, and that I have been able to use it in many different ways

1518
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:38,320
and that I've been able to contribute to society. Yes, and that I've been able to

1519
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:49,360
to earn enough money to live comfortably. And to share what you have. Yes,

1520
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,760
are there, is there anything that feels sort of unfinished about your life at this point? Are there

1521
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:03,760
things that you still have left to do or that you feel like you would like to do better?

1522
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:14,880
Well, no, I don't really think there's any unfinished business. Well, I don't know that I

1523
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:25,920
had any great broad plans to do anything at kind of all just sort of evolved. That's life.

1524
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,480
Oh, I don't think I have any grand notions of what I could accomplish or anything.

1525
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:39,520
It was just that when the opportunity came and I could see that I could help a little bit,

1526
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:52,160
but I took advantage of that, but it wasn't anything pre-meditated. Do you have any advice

1527
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:58,960
I'm thinking about your grandchildren, great grandchildren reading this and wondering if

1528
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:05,760
there is anything that you would suggest to them in terms of kind of an overall way to live your life.

1529
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:12,800
Well, I think the main thing is that you need to be fair and you need to be honest

1530
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:22,400
and you need to take advantage of opportunities that are present in themselves.

1531
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:31,840
And I just think that it's important that you be happy.
