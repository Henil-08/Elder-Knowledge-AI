1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Look right into the cameras at the fun to do or what did you do?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Or it'll give me...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, today is March 7th, 2017, and we were Stephen Strauss's distinguished professor of

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Force Technology OSU, and we will talk to him a very amount about his career and his time at OSU

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'd like to begin by building more of a biographical sketch of your life and ask you where we were.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I was born in Brooklyn, New York.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is that where you grew up?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was there until I was 16, and I've got for college at that point, and never went back.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's really a bunch of various schools and places of employment, but not back then since I started college.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tell me about the Brooklyn of your childhood.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, you know, I had a very simple upbringing.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know, my parents did not have a lot of money, and they also had a fourth child.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And at the time they got to me, they were sort of done being a careful caretakers,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so I really had my run of the streets as it were.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I traveled around New York City on the subways, and buses extensively.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And pretty much called the shots came to one, as I wanted to, so I was a bit of a feral kid.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So that was fun.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tell me a bit about your parents and your family background.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, my father was a postal worker, second half of his life, and worked evenings,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and enjoyed his job a great deal.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He had a great network of friends, and I think he enjoyed being there,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and more than he enjoyed being home with the kids, with my mom.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My mom was a hard worker, but she was set up over a wound,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think, by the depression and raising children,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
was sort of mentally run out, let's say, with the time she got to me.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, you know, very humble, simple upbringing.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, parents had good values, and still didn't need, you know,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ten times over the value of getting an education,

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
making yourself better, and helped me all along the way,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
once they realized I had good academic potential.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They kept finding money, they didn't think they had to keep my academic career going.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, solid upbringing, but also not a great deal of mentoring,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
advice meant, you know, any of those things that I hope I've given to my kids,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
having a better situation.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can you tell me a bit more about community life in the specific neighborhood

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
that you were in, what neighborhood was that?

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It was neighborhood called Barrel Park in New York.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was roughly 350 between quiet religious Jews,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
many of the Pacific, and, you know, dressed in all the garb,

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and refusing to associate really with what you might call mainstream society.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then Italians, and many of those were Sicilians who were first,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
or one and a half generations off the boat,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and they were rough and tough and tumble,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and hated Jews as much as they'd used hated them.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I grew up with most of my friends, who I had a secular type of life,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
my parents were Jewish, but very reformed,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and nothing like the cacetic Jews,

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was something of an in-betweener,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
where I played with these kids, that was out in the street,

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
playing stick ball and football and, you know,

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
just with Italian friends who didn't know what to make of me.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because they were taught to hate Jews, and I was a Jew,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but not really a Jew, because I wasn't like those guys,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and so it was a strange upbringing in that regard.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But some of these Italian friends are still very close to me,

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
even at the stage of my life, and so it was, you know,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
they were struggling with many of them,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
but we're getting brutalized at home.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, that was normal for this Sicily,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and culture they came from.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They came in the five minutes late, and they were getting beaten.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I had a very different kind of upbringing.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So it was quite amazing to see that,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
see the set of Jews, see my in-betweener kind of,

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
growing up, and figured out from there.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What were you interested in as a boy growing up?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, you know, the big, I was interested in sports.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was just a very active sporty kid.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I still run, I referee soccer, I still,

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you know, I follow some of the OSU teams.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So I'm still a sporty guy, so these Italians are very athletic,

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and so that was a real connection.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then probably the big change was, you know,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it's got two teenage years,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and I started, I met friends who were somewhat

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
politically active in protesting, being on war,

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and being interested in recreational marijuana,

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and things that were very common in the generation back then.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I really, I moved away from these Italian kids,

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I moved further away after my apartments,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I did get that done because I felt like the family needed me

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to do that.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And then I moved away from Judaism,

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
moved away from these Italian more rough elements

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and found a group of friends that, you know,

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
were more intelligent.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They were mixed of Jews and Gentiles,

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but more, you would say, progressive or left-leaning.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I grew my hair along, I had beads,

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and junior high school, I remember that started,

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and became, you know, fairly politically active,

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
one to a bunch of demonstrations as a high schooler

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and then a college.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
At what point did science became,

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
kind of something was important to you.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, you know, I had, I went to a high school

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Tech.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So in New York City there's three selective public high schools.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And Brooklyn Tech is one of the three,

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
where there's an entrance exam.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it was, it's really a place for training engineers,

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and in the old school engineers,

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
were people who just shut up and calculated.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And the teaching of science was rough,

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and for people who were gifted and mathematics,

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess it was okay,

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
but I was completely turned off to science.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I wanted no part of it.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All the teachers, the old education system,

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
was the opposite of sort of my somewhat progressive interest.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So when I saw, I graduated,

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I did take the engineering classes,

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I had to at Brooklyn Tech and did fine.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then when I got to college, I went to the state university in New York

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
of purchase, which is sort of an alternative arm of the state university

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
system in New York.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Didn't have grades, had all kinds of experimental teaching systems.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I majored in philosophy for a year,

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
or just trying to figure out what I was interested in and so for it.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And really, because I was interested in the environment,

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and with the saved the world,

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and I didn't see how a degree in philosophy

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
was going to really help me do that.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I was concerned about my economics,

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the ability to survive.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I switched to biology at that point,

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and do the interest in the environment,

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and some kind of a job.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then I got into the science track.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was also, I had skipped a grade in middle school,

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
junior high school as we called it.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was born at the end of the year.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I was almost two years in mature compared to a lot of my peers.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I was really confused in college.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I was going through these transitions,

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of the environment, science, and just using a lot of marijuana

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and other things.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And I was just so finalized at time out,

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
after a year off.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that was a really smart thing to do.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And worked, saved money, did some great travel

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and went to Alaska with friends and other things.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then when I went back,

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was able to transfer to Cornell

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and become a serious science student in Cornell.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Very, very rigorous.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And so really, from then till now,

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I've just been busted my ass, if you will.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Trying to keep up with the incredible pace and demands

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of being a scientist.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's interesting.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was going to ask about how a kid

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
from Brooklyn becomes somebody who spends his career in the forest,

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and it sounds like it.

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It emerged out of this political impulse.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Political impulse.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And along with that, I began to backpap some

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
with some friends.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And when you think about the fires,

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I remember being very curious, you know,

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
what's this tree?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know, who knows?

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What does it do?

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And so I got curious about it.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I love the outdoors.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There was an element of use of drugs in there

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that made me sort of just worship in a religious sense.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I went in some experience with friends

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that were just, you know,

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I still think of this day, these friends

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
of ours.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Friends of mine, you know,

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
talk about how magical it was

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to see the environment,

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
love the environment,

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the reality out there,

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
bond, try to understand it,

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
try to think about being a caretaker of the environment.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And so it was inspirational.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It was what I was, you know,

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that was all that confusion of the youth

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and the feeling of the need to save the environment.

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And then with sort of recreational use of some drugs

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in the comradeship,

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I just became passionate about it.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I don't want to overemphasize

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the drug part,

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
except that it gave a great sense of joy

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and sort of sharing that,

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you know,

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
what would have happened anyway,

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but maybe it was more intense.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How did you select Cornell,

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
or did Cornell select you?

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, I selected Cornell,

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you know,

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
with my limited knowledge base

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
growing up in Brooklyn

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and my parents, you know,

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
working class,

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
neither one of them had a college education.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You know,

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
we just assumed the next thing you do

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is go to Brooklyn College or some

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
very affordable nearby place

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
because you couldn't possibly afford

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to go to town school,

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
let alone Cornell.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And my sister was sort of five years ahead

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
of me and she said if it broke

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
in the thinking shackles

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that, you know,

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
we could do better

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that we could reach higher

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and she encouraged me to apply.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And one thing nice about Cornell is very selective,

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but there's also,

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
it's a hybrid really

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
between a state-supported university

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and a private university.

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And biology is actually split.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I think it still is there.

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So if you get into biology

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and you're a resident of the state

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in New York,

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
your tuition is about half.

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So it made it suddenly affordable

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
whereas it wouldn't have been otherwise.

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And then I started getting a bunch of scholarships

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
because I really worked hard

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and got very good grades.

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then, like I said,

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
then my father realized

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that it was getting a ease of Cornell

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
who was this kid.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He started just paying off debts and stuff.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And sounds like this is an important

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
moment in your life Cornell.

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was the start of,

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you know, a whole new person,

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you know,

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
wasn't this kid in Brooklyn,

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
but was someone who was going somewhere.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And, you know,

248
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I started working with an ecologist at Cornell.

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's also taking all these courses

250
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and biology and evolution

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that, you know, blow your mind,

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and suddenly you're thinking about

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
all this big, big stuff

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and also thinking about saving the world.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And, you know,

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I still never saw myself as a professor

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
or a scientist.

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was really unable to do that.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But, you know,

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'd get a degree

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and then I think, well,

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
great.

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I have a bachelor's now.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do I do with it?

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And the world of biology

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you are a technician for somebody.

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then you think about,

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
well, I'd get a master's

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and it's really the same thing.

270
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And sort of really be a scientist

271
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to be somebody who calls the shots

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
who's thoughts and intellect and ideas

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
or what drives,

274
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
what happens.

275
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You need to in science.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You need to move on.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You need to be on.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You need to get post up.

279
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I just never got off the train

280
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because I realized

281
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I needed to stay on it,

282
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
though I never imagined myself

283
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
being a scientist

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
with my humble upbringing.

285
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So it just kept going.

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I kept having success

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and then from

288
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Cornell,

289
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I got into the Yale School of Forestry

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and Environment,

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
which is another nap today.

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's much more a

293
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
breeding ground for environmental activists

294
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and policy people.

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So it's a fully transition.

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then I went to Cal Workway

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
after that,

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
which is similar.

299
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And so I kept getting into

300
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
this very challenging,

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
very great academic

302
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
environments that were even more

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and more environmentally

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
as well as scientific

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and players on the world scene.

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How did you arrive at Forest Sciences?

307
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Something you wanted to focus on

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
from biology and

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
sort of an entry to you developing

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a scientific foundation,

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but then you focused your

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
perspective a little bit from there.

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, it's a really interesting question.

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think it was the fusion

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
of backpacking and being

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
out in the environment.

317
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I also remember when I was,

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think, 17,

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I hitchhiked out

320
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
from the East Coast to the West Coast.

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I was in our

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
again,

323
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
just as a long hair kid by myself.

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And I remember getting

325
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
out a ride with a

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
longer.

327
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was up in the Oregon

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Cascade somewhere near

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Salem.

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Not really know what I was doing.

331
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This isn't me.

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I thought I was going

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to back back to the

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Cypher Crest,

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to start back backing it.

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It was all under snow.

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And you know,

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I just didn't really know what I was

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
doing.

340
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I had this conversation with

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
this longer.

342
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I sort of told them about

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
all the things I've read

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
from the Sierra Club that

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
helped that

346
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
shower forest view was.

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the Northwest.

348
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And how a clear cut

349
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is a sin that should never happen.

350
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And he just said,

351
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now,

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
let me tell you what we do.

353
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me tell you what the

354
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
safeguards are.

355
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I had no idea how one

356
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
sighted and biased

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
perspective I was getting

358
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
from the Sierra Club.

359
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And that issue actually

360
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
continues to this day.

361
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
As I work in biotechnology,

362
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
where you have the

363
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
organizations that I trusted

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
has been truthful

365
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and telling the whole story,

366
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I know I realize

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
do not.

368
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And so that's one of the steps

369
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
in my evolution from

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
save the world,

371
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
simple science,

372
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
science will save the world

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
to the real politics

374
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and the real information

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
society where

376
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and of course,

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
has exploded of light

378
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
with all the fake news

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and everything.

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But that's been going on

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
forever to one degree or not.

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's just not a presidential

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
but we're quite so blatantly.

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But anyway,

385
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that really opened my eyes

386
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
got me interested.

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So what is really happening

388
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
in far straight?

389
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And why do you clear it?

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And we can do it safely.

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And can you use

392
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
intensive technologies

393
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
of all sorts,

394
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you know,

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
conscientiously responsibly

396
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
amidst all the noise.

397
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And so that's a place

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that you tested a work

399
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in for 30 years

400
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and OSU in the biotech

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
controversy area,

402
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
related to trees

403
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and agriculture in general.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Back to Yale,

405
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
okay,

406
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Fest today was

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
surprised to find out

408
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
that they had a four

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
sites program.

410
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah,

411
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
yeah.

412
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Tell me about that

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
environment for you.

414
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah,

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yale was a,

416
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I went there

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
first

418
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because when I was a Cornell

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and I was

420
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
interning

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
undergraduate research

422
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
with a ecologist.

423
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And he was

424
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
grooming me to go work

425
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
with his PhD supervisor,

426
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
brilliant manning,

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
her movement

428
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
an ecosystem

429
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
biologist.

430
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And I was all set to go there.

431
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then my graduation

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
was

433
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
delayed a year

434
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
because I had

435
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
overlooked a requirement

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in my advisor.

437
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And so I had one more year

438
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
to kind of figure out who I was.

439
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I took a class

440
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in far straight.

441
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I just got a little more interested

442
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
in sort of application

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in the near return sense.

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And so I got to

445
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yale

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to work to the ecosystem

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ecologists and training

448
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
work with her,

449
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but I did work with her

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
of warm and sun.

451
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I sort of

452
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
fear off and became more of a

453
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
physiologist

454
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
practitioner as compared to

455
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
an ecosystem ecologist.

456
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I also discovered

457
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that Yale was a place

458
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
where the number of

459
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
sort of scientists

460
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
taking the number of

461
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
practitioner type scientists

462
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
is very small.

463
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I mean,

464
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
it had really transitioned

465
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
60s and 70s

466
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
into a training ground

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
for

468
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
environmental activists,

469
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
environmental lawyers,

470
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you know,

471
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
a lot of people

472
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
apocalyptic,

473
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
a lot of international organizations

474
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
come through a place

475
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
as like Yale

476
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and Duke

477
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Forestry is done

478
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
a similar thing.

479
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Cal Berkeley

480
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Forestry is done a similar thing.

481
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We're

482
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
really to

483
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
survive

484
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and be a

485
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
college

486
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
in those institutions

487
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that are not

488
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
parents.

489
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Or if they are,

490
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
they're mostly not

491
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
in Berkeley's case,

492
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
they're kind of a split one.

493
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They really had to become

494
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
really working on

495
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
big issues of

496
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
environmental science and

497
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
global sense,

498
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so they transition.

499
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And there's

500
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
still some science there

501
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
in all these places,

502
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but it's relatively small,

503
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
or it's highly

504
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
environmental.

505
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And so it's,

506
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you know,

507
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
in Oregon state still

508
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
we have a lot of

509
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that too,

510
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but we also have a much bigger

511
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
because we serve

512
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
where in this region

513
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
with this incredible forest

514
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
forestry sector,

515
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
whereas New Haven

516
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is not in such a region anymore.

517
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There's still a little bit

518
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
of forestry,

519
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
but very, very little

520
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
by comparison.

521
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And so we here

522
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
try to serve both,

523
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you know,

524
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
training students

525
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
to work in the industry,

526
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
work in the land management

527
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
agencies very actively,

528
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
as well as do science

529
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and being the cutting edge

530
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of the environmental issues.

531
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So anyway,

532
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but being at Yale

533
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
was very much a step into that world,

534
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
which is a world

535
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I wanted to be in my whole life,

536
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but I also realized that

537
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was a little naive,

538
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
maybe,

539
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
thinking that science

540
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
had more of the answers.

541
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And in reality,

542
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I've found the science

543
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
has a lot of answers,

544
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but mostly the laws

545
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and social perceptions

546
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
make it difficult

547
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to have those answers

548
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
to be used

549
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
particularly in the genetics,

550
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
which we can talk about at some point.

551
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

552
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What was your research focus

553
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
at that point?

554
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

555
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So at Yale,

556
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I did,

557
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think, two or three projects

558
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
there were also.

559
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yale doesn't have a

560
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
master's thesis requirement,

561
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
so I got involved in research projects.

562
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I went out to the US Forest Service in California,

563
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in Berkeley,

564
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
actually when I had the Pacific Southwest Station,

565
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I worked with scientists there.

566
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And got my first paper,

567
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
was on the inheritance,

568
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
so pines have these turcanized.

569
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They make them smell sunrise

570
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and the resin that comes down

571
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and tries to protect them from bark,

572
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
beas and so forth.

573
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, the chemistry of that

574
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
rate, that resin varies widely.

575
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And so sometimes you have one chemical,

576
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
sometimes another,

577
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
it's important to the ecology and the organism.

578
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I figured out how it's inherited

579
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
some scientists before me,

580
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
both French feel,

581
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but very, very, very man,

582
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
had made these hybrids

583
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
between different species

584
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and the progeny,

585
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
then had high alpha pining,

586
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
low alpha pining,

587
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
mercy and all these chemicals.

588
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So he said,

589
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
did this basic,

590
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
meeting work,

591
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
crossing species of different industries

592
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
that, and then you could map the genes

593
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
in the project.

594
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So he basically said,

595
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
here's the project,

596
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
you want to map the genes.

597
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And so I went out and

598
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
measured them, you know,

599
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
with help of the scientists,

600
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and that was my first paper.

601
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then there were a couple of other small projects

602
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
like that.

603
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So really,

604
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
what it was,

605
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it was very much being an apprentice

606
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and science is like that a lot,

607
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
where, you know,

608
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
people do projects over many years

609
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and then students and postdocs come in

610
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and sort of figure it out

611
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and add value to it,

612
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
tweak it,

613
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and take it with trees,

614
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
but you know, science in general,

615
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or, you know,

616
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
experiments take years to decades.

617
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And so I came into the stream of science

618
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that, yeah,

619
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
far assigned,

620
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the far service scientists

621
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
were doing in Berkeley,

622
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and was able to publish

623
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and papers,

624
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and that set a set me up

625
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
for, you know,

626
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
getting into grad school,

627
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and talent,

628
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and success from there on.

629
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Was that your first exposure

630
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to the tree genetics?

631
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, it's obviously,

632
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
yeah, really.

633
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, when I went to Yale,

634
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
it was not,

635
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
as I told you, it was the ecosystem scientist.

636
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I started working for a geneticist there

637
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that put me on a couple of projects,

638
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and then he set up this opportunity

639
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
with a far service

640
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in Berkeley,

641
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
California,

642
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and name is Tom Lighting.

643
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He passed away from cancer

644
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
a couple of years ago,

645
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but very, very, very well known

646
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
internationally.

647
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And so he,

648
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and he was at Yale,

649
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and then he moved to the far service,

650
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and so they set up those opportunities.

651
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So I went to Yale,

652
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you know,

653
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't particularly registered in genetics.

654
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was open to it,

655
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and then the opportunities,

656
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the people.

657
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And then I went to Berkeley too,

658
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you know,

659
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that was partly to work with Tom Lighting,

660
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but I still was open to being a physiologist,

661
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
a silvicultrist,

662
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
managing forest,

663
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and a larger scale,

664
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
made the oncologist even

665
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
of some kind,

666
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and then again,

667
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
opportunities,

668
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the far service there.

669
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Also one other theme in all this

670
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is one thing that's frustrating me

671
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
about ecology,

672
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and it still does a lot,

673
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is it's hard to measure things precisely.

674
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You know,

675
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
it's,

676
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and to somebody,

677
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
a lot of scientists,

678
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
they want to get to the bottom of things.

679
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They don't want to have a conclusion.

680
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That says,

681
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
well,

682
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to this community that can be this,

683
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
we have data,

684
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
we have models,

685
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
you know,

686
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
what's this way,

687
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and that's just an nature of the beast.

688
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And in genetics,

689
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you tend to get much closer to hard answers.

690
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And that was appealing to me.

691
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And then all the genetic technology

692
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that was coming along,

693
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
continues to just,

694
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
you know,

695
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
my whole career,

696
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the field of genetics,

697
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
is exploded five times,

698
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
was attractive,

699
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you know,

700
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so it was enzymes,

701
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and it's first was Turkinoids,

702
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and the chemistry thereof,

703
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and the gas chromatographs,

704
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and that was these enzymes

705
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
who were doing for look at genetic variation,

706
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in a way that we never did,

707
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and then it was DNA,

708
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and then it was genomics,

709
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
so doing DNA on massive scale,

710
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and then genetic engineering,

711
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so that it's been this progression

712
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that would incredibly powerful,

713
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and intellectually exciting,

714
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and potentially very important technologies.

715
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So that's also pulled me out of ecology,

716
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
something.

717
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
These technologies,

718
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and I've been using ecology quite a lot,

719
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
but it's taken a long time to get there.

720
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Sounds like it was a fairly seamless transition

721
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to Berkeley for you.

722
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, yeah, you know, I've been there before,

723
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and you know, I knew the place,

724
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and I loved it.

725
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, I just loved being in Berkeley,

726
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
those five years I was there.

727
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was, you know,

728
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
it's a great environment for a young person,

729
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and definitely a very,

730
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
artificial environment.

731
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And the reason I say that,

732
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
as I want to,

733
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
one of my memories from there,

734
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is I think the first year we were there,

735
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
so this would be 1980,

736
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I hope I have the story right.

737
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Reagan was running against,

738
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I think it was Jenny Carter,

739
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
maybe for Carter's second term or something like that,

740
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and it could be in Berkeley

741
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and think that Carter was a shoe in.

742
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And of course,

743
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think he won no state,

744
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but Massachusetts or something like that.

745
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And, you know,

746
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
so again, you're in this little bubble of Berkeley,

747
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and you know, everything's very progressive,

748
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you know, realize where the country is at,

749
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
as the police said,

750
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
it's sort of a little bit of this last election.

751
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

752
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Tell me a bit more about this time,

753
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you progressed through your PhD years.

754
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

755
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The, you know,

756
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the PhD in Berkeley,

757
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
it was really a good format,

758
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
really enjoyed Cal Berkeley a lot.

759
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It had a lot of sort of what I was mentioning about,

760
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
yeah, the environmental stuff,

761
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the foam and the science,

762
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and also had a lot,

763
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
still a lot of the traditional stuff,

764
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
some of the older economists

765
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and civil cultures,

766
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
very, very famous people,

767
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and Fox Johnson,

768
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
my main mentor at Berkeley,

769
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Billy,

770
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
very charismatic guy,

771
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
very much,

772
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
really in the mold that I've taken on a micro,

773
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I've kind of been a,

774
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
a spokesperson,

775
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
if you will,

776
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
for the use of genetic engineering,

777
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
as a technology in far strip,

778
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
which is difficult thing.

779
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's difficult,

780
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
biologically,

781
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
it's difficult,

782
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
socially,

783
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
a lot of the incredible power of environmental groups,

784
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
around the world,

785
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that's exploded during my life.

786
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They're almost all opposed to either unilaterally,

787
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or extremely negative.

788
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So, Bill was kind of,

789
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
he was a,

790
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
a proponent of cloning in far strip.

791
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So, you know,

792
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you got to a wild forest now,

793
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
every tree is a unique genotype,

794
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
like humans,

795
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
mostly are,

796
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
with the exception of the occasional identical twin.

797
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And he said,

798
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
well,

799
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
what if you could pick the very most productive one,

800
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
out of this mass evaluation,

801
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
you know,

802
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
not just one,

803
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
but the top,

804
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the top ten,

805
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the top hundred for production purposes.

806
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
For wild forest,

807
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you'll maintain all the diversity you possibly can,

808
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but for production forests.

809
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If we could clone it,

810
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the benefits would be ploned,

811
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and the benefits would be used.

812
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And so,

813
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
he argued that his whole career,

814
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and had some success.

815
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I mean,

816
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
some of it was used,

817
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but he was very much pushing against the tie to that point,

818
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that the industry was very traditional,

819
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and then the environmental tie as well.

820
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, I've said it,

821
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
in a sense,

822
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
followed in its footsteps,

823
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
which is interesting,

824
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
you know,

825
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
just I think,

826
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but being also outspoken on some of these policy issues,

827
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and using sort of innovative,

828
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
new,

829
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
socially,

830
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
novel,

831
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
genetic technology.

832
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Me and the GMO area,

833
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
in the,

834
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the Conan area.

835
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So, anyway,

836
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you know,

837
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
he's a very outspoken guy,

838
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and so he's very influential to me.

839
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And,

840
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but the whole,

841
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
intellectual environment of Berkway was very stimulating,

842
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
like,

843
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
TA in forest policy.

844
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So, you know,

845
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
as a young scientist,

846
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
among most scientists,

847
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I would say,

848
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
have a limited notion of what how policies are made,

849
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and how laws are passed,

850
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and what they mean.

851
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They just figure,

852
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
you know,

853
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you learn how it works in nature,

854
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and then you do it smarter and better.

855
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And the notion that there's all these layers of roles,

856
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and rigs,

857
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and perceptions,

858
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
invested interests,

859
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
you know,

860
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
we're just kind of naive,

861
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I mean,

862
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
it's just that simple.

863
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And so,

864
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
being at Berkway was a time,

865
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
my eyes opened up,

866
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
you know,

867
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
taking and teaching about forest policy,

868
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
you know,

869
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
realize that,

870
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you know,

871
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
if scientists really want to change the world,

872
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
they really need to be out there.

873
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They can't be naive in their labs,

874
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
in their little fields,

875
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
they have to be out there interacting with society.

876
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And,

877
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you know,

878
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I think I've done some of that,

879
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
not as much as some of my colleagues,

880
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but,

881
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you know,

882
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and I think today,

883
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you see a lot of activity on campuses,

884
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and that scientists need to do it even more.

885
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I mean,

886
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I have this March on Science,

887
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
March 4 science coming up,

888
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
in April,

889
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and I think it's scientists saying,

890
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
you know,

891
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
it's just not going to be okay to be quiet.

892
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You have to get out there.

893
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And,

894
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
but speaking for scientists,

895
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
also,

896
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm rambling around it,

897
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
but speaking for science,

898
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is also really complicated.

899
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The scientists are all biased and ideological,

900
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
like everybody else,

901
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
so it's a really messy thing.

902
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Your dissertation was,

903
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
uninstallage and exercise,

904
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
that correct?

905
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It was,

906
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
back on those days,

907
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
they had these enzyme technologies,

908
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
called isosines,

909
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
or alasines,

910
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
so it turns out that,

911
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you know,

912
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
you have thousands of proteins in your body,

913
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
trees do too,

914
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and do the genetic variation,

915
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the forms of those proteins vary.

916
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They just do what they do,

917
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but they do it a little bit different way.

918
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And so,

919
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
back in the 60s,

920
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
70s, 80s scientists realize that,

921
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
instead of measuring genetic variation,

922
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
say based on variation,

923
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and height of people like ourselves,

924
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that are influenced by the environment,

925
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
how will you,

926
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
as well as your DNA,

927
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
you could look right at the products of DNA,

928
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
these proteins.

929
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We weren't able to look at DNA itself yet,

930
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
so that whole alasine,

931
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
genetic diversity,

932
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
technology was very,

933
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
very big for 30 years,

934
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and that's my thesis about trying to see,

935
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
if you could look at the amount of

936
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
genetic polymorphism,

937
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
variability in these enzymes,

938
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and trees,

939
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and could predict their productivity,

940
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
our trees that have a greater diversity of enzymes,

941
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
of a more productive and a natural environment.

942
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Using them materials are available to me.

943
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That was the question that I tried to answer,

944
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and I had some success in the sense

945
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that I got some applications out about it,

946
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and good journals,

947
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
but by no means that I resolve it at that level.

948
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Now,

949
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that question actually,

950
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
a bigger question in science,

951
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
still continues.

952
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So you finished up at Calen 1985,

953
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and then you arrived at OSU,

954
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
how did that come about?

955
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That was an amazing thing,

956
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
so I did this thesis that was really about

957
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
genetic polymorphism,

958
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
whether it predicts productivity,

959
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and environmental stress tolerance,

960
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
was another element of it,

961
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and it had experimental plantations,

962
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
but it wasn't really about production,

963
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and it wasn't about biotechnology,

964
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and any means that wasn't called biotechnology,

965
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
we didn't have that word really back then.

966
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And at the time,

967
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
in the 80s,

968
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and I was at Cal,

969
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the field of biotechnology,

970
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
so we're committed DNA,

971
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
cutting and splicing genes,

972
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
was starting.

973
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It started in bacteria a few years earlier,

974
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and scientists were beginning to use it.

975
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Study disease is to study cancer,

976
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
to study human pathogens of various sorts,

977
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and then it started percolating and percolating into plants,

978
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
or people using it the same way.

979
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then scientists figured out

980
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
how they could transfer genes from one organism to another,

981
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
so they could do sort of what people had done in bacteria years earlier,

982
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
they could now do an implant

983
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to the possibility of genetic engineering plants

984
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
for enhanced traits suddenly was there,

985
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and everybody was talking about it.

986
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I remember,

987
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think it was 84 year before I graduated,

988
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
my mentor Tom Ledig,

989
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and I mentioned from Yale,

990
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I went to Berkeley,

991
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
held a big conference about how should we,

992
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
how should we be using biotechnologies in forestry,

993
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
what are the opportunities,

994
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
what are the constraints,

995
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and I'm watching this,

996
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and I'm not a biotechnologist,

997
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I didn't really know what DNA was per se,

998
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
apart from,

999
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and suddenly it's like this is the next big thing.

1000
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's coming at us,

1001
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and then the year 84,

1002
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
85,

1003
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
depending on exactly how you dated,

1004
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the first genetic engineer plant was created,

1005
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and then two years later,

1006
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the first job of the engineer tree,

1007
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
a poverty tree,

1008
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
that I've actually continued to work on,

1009
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
most of them,

1010
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
my career was created,

1011
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and far as service is working on it,

1012
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
just seeing like this is just a big,

1013
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a big, wonderful thing,

1014
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and a big scientific technological challenge.

1015
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And so I remember when this job came open,

1016
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
at Oregon State,

1017
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I was,

1018
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you know,

1019
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
somewhere around December,

1020
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
or so,

1021
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
before,

1022
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
maybe January of 85,

1023
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and I remember seeing it,

1024
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
someone pointed out to me,

1025
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you know,

1026
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
so we've always had Oregon State,

1027
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we've always had really strong forest genetics,

1028
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
sort of a subdiscipline of forest science,

1029
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and we've been strong in,

1030
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
at OSU,

1031
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
we've been strong in the forest service,

1032
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
right across the parking lot,

1033
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and so we had a geneticist,

1034
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Kim Chang,

1035
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
who was retiring,

1036
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and so they said,

1037
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
well,

1038
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
what should we do?

1039
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Should we hire another Kim Chang,

1040
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or a gene meaning chromosome level,

1041
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
genetic biology of trees,

1042
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Douglas Far,

1043
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
or should we start going down deeper,

1044
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
just go down to the DNA level,

1045
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that's where the science is going,

1046
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that's all this,

1047
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
all this foaming going on,

1048
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and so we said,

1049
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
we're gonna take over,

1050
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we're asking higher biotechnology,

1051
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and I don't think any other far,

1052
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
as we school had done so yet.

1053
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But,

1054
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
at that time,

1055
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
there were two or three that did it,

1056
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
so I don't remember if it was us,

1057
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
or in the sea state,

1058
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
or who was actually number one,

1059
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
we were right there,

1060
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
instead of taking this risk really,

1061
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
to invest in this new area.

1062
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And so at that point,

1063
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
there,

1064
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
there were not a cadre of farce biotechnology,

1065
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
PhDs and postdocs around,

1066
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
because if you don't even exist,

1067
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
there were a couple,

1068
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
just starting who had done work,

1069
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and other species,

1070
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
barley,

1071
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
a colleague of mine,

1072
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Daniel,

1073
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and I want you to grab very great scientists,

1074
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
had done a postdoc,

1075
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and barley learning some of that stuff,

1076
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but it wasn't trees,

1077
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
these are some of my competitors,

1078
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and for this job.

1079
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Anyway, so I asked my mentors,

1080
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I just said,

1081
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
what's with this biotechnology thing?

1082
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Is this like,

1083
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
flash in the pan?

1084
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Is it, you know,

1085
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
should I apply for this job?

1086
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't have back,

1087
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and I said,

1088
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
yeah, you should apply it for it.

1089
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You're as qualified as anybody,

1090
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
getting how young this field is,

1091
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and then I went on this crash course

1092
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
of learning about biotechnology.

1093
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And so I applied,

1094
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and they basically hired me on the notion

1095
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that I had potential to grow with the field,

1096
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and, you know,

1097
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I would say,

1098
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I would expect that turned out to be a pretty good,

1099
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
pretty good guess.

1100
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And so,

1101
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
that's how it started.

1102
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I really,

1103
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
this is really a new venture for me.

1104
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It was a new venture for

1105
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
far straight LSU,

1106
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and, you know,

1107
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
it's had a number of turns that,

1108
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
no one predicted,

1109
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
but it's,

1110
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
from a science point of view,

1111
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
from a career,

1112
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
development point of view,

1113
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
it's, you know,

1114
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
been a very successful.

1115
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

1116
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So it was like a nice piece of

1117
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
strategic thing here,

1118
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a visionary thing here.

1119
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think so.

1120
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, I think they knew they were doing that.

1121
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They didn't want to know where it was going to go,

1122
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and I got here,

1123
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you know,

1124
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I said,

1125
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
so what are you going to do?

1126
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I said, I don't know.

1127
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, what's by your technology,

1128
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
figure it out,

1129
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and do it.

1130
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And actually the first five,

1131
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
seven years,

1132
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I realized that

1133
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
genetic engineering was not really,

1134
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you know,

1135
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it had been done once,

1136
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
in one place,

1137
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
a tree was engineered,

1138
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
but it wasn't ready to go.

1139
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So what can I do,

1140
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and what I realized I could do,

1141
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and I was also a very successful,

1142
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and made a name for myself,

1143
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
early as I could use these DNA techniques,

1144
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and I think you're out,

1145
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
the evolution of some of our major tree species.

1146
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I think I had the most important paper at that time,

1147
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
on pines and how they evolved.

1148
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I had the most important paper at that time,

1149
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
on Douglas Farr,

1150
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and its relatives,

1151
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and where it came from,

1152
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and the relationship to all its relatives

1153
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
around the Pacific,

1154
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
around and beyond.

1155
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So there's a lot of insights that,

1156
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
you know,

1157
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
when you get to the DNA level,

1158
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
when you get an insight about

1159
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
relationships and evolution,

1160
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
they're often very,

1161
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
very strong.

1162
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
For a decision,

1163
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
you get when you sequence or analyze DNA

1164
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to that level,

1165
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
suddenly people say,

1166
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
well,

1167
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
it's not just his opinion about

1168
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
whether the size of the cones,

1169
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
of the effectiveness of the bars,

1170
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
the most important trait,

1171
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
it's this,

1172
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you know, sort of random look at the DNA,

1173
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and it's just shelves at you,

1174
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
which trees are most related to which,

1175
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
who the common ancestor is,

1176
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and so,

1177
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
what I did the first five or seven years,

1178
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I did a lot of this,

1179
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
genetic evolutionary analysis,

1180
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and it's a really high quality science,

1181
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and the people at OSU,

1182
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
my idea in the department,

1183
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I would have luck to see me,

1184
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
like help the forest industry,

1185
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
right in and out,

1186
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and I said,

1187
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
this is the right thing to be doing right now.

1188
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And so,

1189
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you know,

1190
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
they didn't have a very open mind about it.

1191
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But then eventually,

1192
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself,

1193
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but I'll mention briefly,

1194
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
what happened in Oregon and in Northwest is,

1195
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
people started worrying about

1196
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
sources of wood and pulp,

1197
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
because we had to spot it out of the war,

1198
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
as we had rising environmentalism,

1199
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and people were afraid that wooden DNA would,

1200
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so they started investing in the Department of Energy,

1201
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
made major investments in growing these

1202
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
popular trees and plantations,

1203
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
like the ones along I-84,

1204
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that we talked about.

1205
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Those are products of that,

1206
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and so people started doing serious research,

1207
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and that was a big project

1208
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
that University of Washington on that,

1209
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and I realized that I had the expertise

1210
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that was developed to add a genetic engineering element to it.

1211
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And that started early 90s,

1212
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
late 80s, early 90s,

1213
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and I started working with the industries

1214
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and developed an industry cooperative,

1215
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
consortium, basically a public private partnership,

1216
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and our College of Forestry has a bunch of those,

1217
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and still does,

1218
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
where they provide money.

1219
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Not a lot of money,

1220
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but enough to sort of help guide it

1221
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
toward things of interest to them,

1222
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and then we at the University of Utah,

1223
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
use our resources,

1224
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and go out and go grant dollars

1225
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
to sort of make good science of relevance happen.

1226
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And working in Poplar,

1227
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
as I mentioned,

1228
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
our industry that was engineering was a popular,

1229
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
suddenly people are thinking about growing

1230
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Poplar's on a major scale,

1231
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and Oregon in the Northwest.

1232
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's use this technology to do it even better.

1233
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And so a lot of my career has been said,

1234
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
if I took that step,

1235
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for I'm this consortium,

1236
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
started working on Poplar's in genetic engineering,

1237
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and I quickly got involved

1238
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
in some of the social and legal issues

1239
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
on it, like I said earlier,

1240
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
those are big,

1241
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and they've continued to be big.

1242
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So that was the reason I made that shift

1243
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
early in my career at OSU,

1244
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
into genetic engineering per se,

1245
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and also helping to deal with

1246
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the social elements,

1247
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
working with industries,

1248
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
forest industries, biotech industries,

1249
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and so that's been kind of the big middle

1250
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
of my career in self-contentures.

1251
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What is it about Poplar's,

1252
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and I think much attracted to this work?

1253
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You know,

1254
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
they're much better from a science point of view,

1255
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
they're much better model organisms.

1256
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So everything about Douglas Farr and Pine,

1257
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
you can imagine

1258
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
when it comes to doing genetic manipulation as hard.

1259
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Those turpentines,

1260
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I mentioned early,

1261
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
well, they mess up your getting your DNA

1262
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
out and analyzing it.

1263
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
People have sort of gotten it out over at these days,

1264
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
but it's just one other thing.

1265
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The genomes are huge.

1266
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
In Poplar's,

1267
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
we figured out pretty early on,

1268
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the number one tree,

1269
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
how to insert a gene,

1270
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
or modify a gene,

1271
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and then grow the progeny

1272
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and see how that one gene affects them.

1273
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And in the coniferous,

1274
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that's still incredibly difficult to do,

1275
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
very expensive and very difficult.

1276
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So something about them makes them easier

1277
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
to engineer,

1278
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
their genomes are small,

1279
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
they grow faster.

1280
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's very powerful in genetics.

1281
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
When you make a genetic change,

1282
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
or you have a genetic variant of interest,

1283
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
to make copies of it.

1284
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Just for replications,

1285
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
so you have high quality science,

1286
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
poplar's,

1287
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and nature,

1288
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
cloned themselves all the time.

1289
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's, you know,

1290
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
these asspins you may have read about,

1291
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
these grows of asspins.

1292
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They're kinds of poplar's,

1293
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
can cover many many acres in one single genotype.

1294
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That doesn't happen much in coniferous.

1295
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So they're easier to make copies of.

1296
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So there's a bunch of reasons,

1297
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
easy to transform,

1298
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
small genome,

1299
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
easy to make copies of faster growing.

1300
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That makes them very good genetic models.

1301
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then also,

1302
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you know,

1303
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the industry was already looking at making hybrids,

1304
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
between different species,

1305
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
to increase productivity.

1306
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They were already cloning them for plantations.

1307
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And so the genetics was very intense.

1308
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And then adding genetic engineering,

1309
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
as another kind of genetics made sense,

1310
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because the industry had already brought it in science.

1311
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's already brought it to this level.

1312
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's take that level further.

1313
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
When you look at,

1314
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Douglas,

1315
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
or our pines,

1316
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
even today,

1317
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the genetics is primitive,

1318
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
you know,

1319
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
compared to any crop species,

1320
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
compared to poplar's.

1321
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And so it's not prior to sage,

1322
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
genetic engineering is what we need to do now.

1323
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We're still sitting in the neolithic with breeding.

1324
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So it doesn't make as much sense.

1325
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The compost it does.

1326
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So you have all these reasons,

1327
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the biology as well as the state of breeding.

1328
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And then also,

1329
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
if you're making a particular product with

1330
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
poplar's like pulp,

1331
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
or particular kinds of wood or biofuels,

1332
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you can optimize it much more.

1333
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And that's how the industry came about,

1334
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
whereas in this sort of generalized forestry,

1335
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
we're making all kinds of things,

1336
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and they're all kinds of conditions.

1337
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
We don't control the environment as much

1338
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
as they grow on it.

1339
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You know, steep hillsides,

1340
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
and poppers,

1341
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
it's more agricultural.

1342
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
In fact, they're regulated as agricultural crops,

1343
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
by Oregon and Washington.

1344
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And so everything about the social and biological environment

1345
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
made it sensible to consider trying to add

1346
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
in genetic engineering as an exgenetic technology.

1347
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah.

1348
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Backing up,

1349
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
just a hair.

1350
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean,

1351
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
just to be collecting a little bit of institutional knowledge about that.

1352
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

1353
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I've been in diversity of college.

1354
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Well, what do you remember about your early impressions of OSU

1355
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and of the College of Forestry?

1356
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You know,

1357
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
the things I've stand out over all these years,

1358
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Dean Stomberg, who hired me,

1359
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and successor George Brown,

1360
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
just as an incredible sense of,

1361
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
you know,

1362
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
go out there and make an impact.

1363
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Serve the state,

1364
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the nation's serve, just this incredible ethic of service.

1365
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,360
You know, I came out of, I came in here still somewhat young,

1366
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,720
still very much wanting to do science and wanting to survive also in academia.

1367
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,840
I was very nervous, you know, I was going to be able to get tenure and, you know,

1368
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,520
and I just, and they really wanted much more.

1369
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,320
They weren't interested so much, I'm going to survive and get my own grand,

1370
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,360
but what am I going to do to change the world for the better?

1371
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,560
Well, how am I going to, and also they had a sense of how am I going to serve?

1372
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,120
The Oregon industry, they're, and they're, again, more productive and economic and more vital.

1373
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,760
So I just felt that, and I felt the pressure of it,

1374
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,960
but I also felt that it was wholesome and real and good.

1375
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,320
And so that was another reason for the transition to poplers.

1376
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,960
I, I mentioned, I did this genetic work early on in the evolutionary relationships at different species.

1377
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,240
That was a great way to use biotech methods to advance science,

1378
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,480
but it wasn't really going to advance Oregon farce.

1379
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
Right, and except in a very fundamental level.

1380
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,440
And so when poplers came along, and the fact that I could use genetic engineering,

1381
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,760
I could do great science, and it can have an impact on the industry and on society, maybe tomorrow.

1382
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,280
If we can really grow trees, you know, 10%, 20% better by using genetic engineering methods,

1383
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,280
and we can do it in poplers in my lab and get it out there, you know, that's exciting.

1384
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,960
That a conjunction of application, and, you know, one thing that we've worked on two

1385
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,160
for many years that tied into my environmental background is, you know, it was pretty obvious to me,

1386
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,240
that generic engineering trees, poplers, we're going to be controversial for our different species.

1387
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,040
We've already seen an agriculture in medicine, and so it's not like society is going to just say,

1388
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
Rara, Rara, Rara, let's have more of it.

1389
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,080
They're going to say, I don't like this, or they're going to say, who controls it,

1390
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
and so on and so forth.

1391
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
And how should we regulate it?

1392
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,800
What should the role of a EPA being, and should we really have very strict regulations?

1393
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,200
So I, you know, it was obvious to me that was all going to happen, and what's happening, and the

1394
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:14,480
the biggest issue that science can deal with about that is, so release of propagules into

1395
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,000
natural environments.

1396
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,920
So I think cognitively you cross a line when you say we're going to genically engineer something.

1397
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,520
Then you're really saying that humans are really taking control of this organism and changing

1398
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,640
into their needs.

1399
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,120
Of course, we do that with conventional breeding, and all of our crops, corn, whatever it is,

1400
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,480
are looking at something like their wild relatives, and we've made that cognitively,

1401
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,440
but I think now we're even more conscious of that than we used to be.

1402
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,160
Genic engineering, because it's a, you know, unnatural, mostly unnatural technique.

1403
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,360
It does happen in nature, but not commonly, you cross this cognitive line where it was,

1404
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,080
obviously, just to me, that people are not going to, well, people might say, well, I accept

1405
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,680
in these intensive popular plantations that look nothing like unnatural, that genic engineering

1406
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,560
can have a place, but I don't want that pollen and seeds spreading out into wild, riparian

1407
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,120
cotton would areas where really what we value is by our diversity and all the ecosystem functions.

1408
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,560
That's going to be a problem, and indeed it is, so we said, you know, so we need to,

1409
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,760
for those plantation trees, we need to shut down flowering.

1410
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,400
We think trees will grow faster as a result, but the main thing is that even though poppers

1411
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,600
do a vegetarian, we spread a little bit, we can manage that, you know, but we can't manage

1412
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:40,000
pollen floating, you know, miles and miles in there. And so another exciting thing was, in addition

1413
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,920
to developing the gene transfer methods and working with industries to test things,

1414
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,960
we said, we're going to develop the genetic containment technology,

1415
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,680
so society accepts it. And we continue to make that our focus all these years,

1416
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,520
and that really tied into my sort of environmental consciousness coming in.

1417
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,320
Let's use advanced technology, but let's do it right. And so that's, you know, that's probably

1418
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,720
what I'm most known for around the world is developing this containment technology,

1419
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,320
and putting it into practice. To test a long time, you know, the science things are wild,

1420
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,080
getting the genes in, and then if you're studying flowering, you have to wait years,

1421
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,720
because trees don't flower right away. So it really is. I didn't realize it so much at the time,

1422
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,920
when I made that decision in the early 90s, I was committing to two or three decades of experiments,

1423
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,560
and that's what's happened. You know, they're still going on, they're still on the field,

1424
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,840
outside, we're out. So at what point did you start to receive some pushback from various

1425
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,560
outside entities? Was that pretty much from the get-go? You know, in the beginning,

1426
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,440
there really has been, and I don't know that anybody's measured it, I'm sure actually,

1427
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,080
that's what they haven't measured it. I should probably go find the papers that they've done it,

1428
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:56,320
but I used to mock some of the media coverage, and including how us use own public relations,

1429
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,160
that here's biotechnology, it's to answer to all our problems. It's going to feed the world,

1430
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,320
it's going to, you know, rat revolutionize, we're going to make square trees that, you know,

1431
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,680
just go right into the boards, you know, it's all this crazy stuff that I knew was not going to

1432
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,800
have, they're not going to happen in my lifetime, so it was hot. And society kind of, that's where

1433
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,320
they were sitting giddy about it, and then over, I think it was the late 90s when various things

1434
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:30,480
happened, and agricultural biotechnology, where then the media coverage became pretty negative,

1435
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,200
and big environmental groups, like Greenpeace, with, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars,

1436
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,720
funds, essentially environmental corporations decided they were against all of it everywhere,

1437
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,240
whether you were making, you know, a vitamin A to deal with blindness, whether you're trying

1438
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,600
to make sure they're against all of it, it was an ideological thing, and so probably because

1439
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,480
organizations like that, with a lot of power and money changed, things shifted, things became

1440
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,600
much more negative, and then in the, again, in the later 90s, when you started to see a lot of

1441
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:11,120
evangelism, first in agricultural biotechnology, then in forestry, and so in 2001 was a big year

1442
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,080
here at Oregon State and Corvallis, we had evangelism, somebody came in and there in the middle

1443
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,800
of the night, you know, in Corvallis, and cut through a wire fence and damage it at 1,000 trees.

1444
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,040
It was at night, and you can't tell at 1,000, if you end, and you hear it from 1s that are,

1445
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,160
and so most of them, they actually didn't hit what they wanted to, but you know, it was

1446
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,080
indication of just the intensity of the issue that I think was in March, and then in June,

1447
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,960
there was Arson, against the collaborative mind of the University of Washington, his building was

1448
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,160
almost completely burned down, a collaborating industry, and Klatskin, I had a million dollars,

1449
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,240
and farm equipment damage, so it really wrapped up, and it really got intense.

1450
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I was the chair of an international society for tree biotechnology,

1451
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:06,240
we were having a meeting in Oxford in, I guess it was 1999, a couple years earlier, and the one,

1452
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:13,040
the one field trial of the gentry in England was vandalized, the evening of our international

1453
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:20,320
site to the conference, and so all these things told me that holy cow society is not with us,

1454
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,480
and then Europe, in particular, which was sort of finally reacting against MontSanto, and bringing in,

1455
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,680
you know, gentry engineers, soybeans, as animal feed into the country, and blockading them,

1456
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,600
and all that, when these trees were damaged, outside of Oxford, and these trees were trees

1457
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:45,040
that had, without going into the technical details, they were engineered to be easier to pulp,

1458
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,920
being take less energy, less chemicals to produce the same amount of pulp. So it's something that

1459
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,400
we all thought of science at the environmentalists were in love, and then we have strong support for it,

1460
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,800
but no, the bigger narrative in society really dominated that. So when these trees were destroyed,

1461
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,080
the science of what we were doing was irrelevant, and the storyline, the major media, the

1462
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,720
Guardian and others was MontSanto, now they're wreak havoc in the food supply, and now they're

1463
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,560
going to wreak havoc in our forests, and we are all like holy cow, you know, what are these guys

1464
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:26,400
smoking? But you know, that's how big the social narrative is about gentry and engineering and GMOs.

1465
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,920
The details of the science really don't matter much, and that's a hard thing to remember,

1466
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,760
but anyway, so, you know, 1999, 2001, also in 2001, we had 9-11 in the United States,

1467
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,360
and the government called Eco Terrorist, Terrorist, and they pursued them the same ways,

1468
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,080
they pursued people who were bonding the World Trade Center, and so that kind of stuff stopped.

1469
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,680
The guys who did this stuff in Oregon and Washington were mostly cotton, but in jail,

1470
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:02,160
and Europe, they continued, in the US, it stopped. But that was, you know, a big marker that

1471
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,840
things were just crazy at a hand. But society's reaction continued to ramp up after that,

1472
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,040
and, you know, one of the conditions we have today is that a great piece in others who have already

1473
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,200
against this stuff have created conditions, or a forest, industries, really can't usually have a

1474
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:24,480
engineering career. Their own certification organizations don't allow it, even a research.

1475
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,480
So, the field trials, the collaborative work I've done with industries years ago,

1476
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,040
doesn't happen anymore, because our happens outside of the Northwest and very special conditions,

1477
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,000
because the social conditions have become so hostile, you know, just like in organic food,

1478
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,480
you can't have any GMO in a no matter what. Even though scientists will say,

1479
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,080
well, there's good use as other, in addition to the ones that are questionable,

1480
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,640
it's an all-or-nothing thing, and that's where society's at with forest who uses right now.

1481
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,560
And one of the things I've done in my career is try to argue that we need research

1482
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,720
to find out what other good use is what are the not-so-good use is how we can make,

1483
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,640
and not-so-good use can make it good, you know, and, you know, that kind of, that's really not

1484
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,320
gone anywhere, even though I've tried to sort of, what I would consider to have a more middle

1485
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,680
or more reasonable science-based agenda, the environmental community, the marketing,

1486
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,720
arm of it, in particular, feels like this is the way they have to be to get the consumers

1487
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,360
to buy their products, to charge more for it, and maybe do the right thing on their view.

1488
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,080
So, it's become a hostile world, I'm really, I'll be able to finish my career using this technology,

1489
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,520
but by and large, in forestry around the world, the amount of interest in genetic engineering

1490
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,120
is that that is really gone. It's not zero, but it's really gone way down. The social pushback

1491
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:54,800
is, you know, been bigger than anybody, sort of imagine. So, how have you been able to navigate

1492
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,760
that or how have you, and of course, to adapt their compromise? Yeah, you know, it's a reality,

1493
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,480
and, you know, it's important to recognize it's sort of a 12-step thing, recognize what you can change,

1494
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,880
and what you can. And so, you know, I've written a bunch of papers about how a lot of smarter

1495
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,800
way would be to regulate what a smarter way to be to market it. I had a paper in science magazine

1496
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,960
last year, I've been up to the published in the very best journals, putting forward ideas of

1497
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,400
collaborating with lawyers and economists, you know, to get the social stuff right, you know, being

1498
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,440
on a biologist. But, you know, there's a larger, larger forces, larger social economic forces,

1499
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,480
you know, big companies profit from, you know, avoiding GMOs. They're not going to stop doing it,

1500
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,240
you know, it's not just full of software as a huge, a profit margin to saying you're cleaner than

1501
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,080
now, and I call it greenwashing, but it's everywhere in the marketplace. Now, I can't buy a little

1502
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,400
for a breath that I want without a no GMO seal, even though I'd like to avoid it because I know

1503
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,560
it's meaningless. So, that's, you know, it's a bigger thing. So, what do you do in that,

1504
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,280
from my point of view, you know, we had at OSU, we had an outreach and biotechnology program,

1505
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,560
mainly funded to the College of Act, probably funded through forestry, that I was the chair

1506
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:23,120
of the director for about eight years. It was kind of a soft program. It used to be something

1507
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,120
that was a hard program, an extension, and a set of got software over the years. But we did,

1508
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,600
we had a website and we hosted 40 public lectures, we got amazing scientists,

1509
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,360
all of the other coming up, talked to the public in Corvallis about all these issues.

1510
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,640
So, that was one way that I thought I could sort of really help change society or make society smarter

1511
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:52,560
about this. And I think it was super successful, but I think OSU, the College of Agriculture,

1512
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,280
has sort of tired over this, and there's only so much science can do. And so, they've set

1513
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,000
it back away, they don't want to alienate, they're more organic elements, they're not anti-GMO.

1514
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,000
And so, most universities, not all of them, but some larger jarty have said,

1515
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:14,160
this is bigger than we can deal with. Our state funds are being cut. We'd rather have somebody

1516
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,760
who's breeding berries, then nobody breeding berries, and how they, somebody fighting this

1517
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,560
way of anti-biotechnology, because it's very complicated. You know, if you do responsible

1518
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,960
outreach about it, it's not just a raw, raw, raw, raw. Here's the trade-offs. Here's the pros and

1519
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,800
the cons, and the centros. So, it's a complicated story. So, anyway, from my own point of view,

1520
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,760
I've said of thought, wrote scientific papers, talked to regulators. I still get a 304 or

1521
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,440
five talks a year about, I talked at the public library in Salem to the environmental educators

1522
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,040
consortium of there a few weeks ago. So, I still do things occasionally, but the basic

1523
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,640
I've said, you know, I could do research to advance the science and the technology.

1524
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,880
And when society is ready, if they're ever ready, it'll be there. And so, that's right,

1525
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,000
but 95% of my energies is doing the science. And it's hard, one thing, the conditions are

1526
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,080
sufficiently adverse in both Europe and the United States for applied biotechnology and the public

1527
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:24,480
sector, that it's very hard to go to a USDA or department of energy, grant pounds, and say,

1528
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,520
I have an idea for a better genophangine or treat. We're going to treat this and ask, and then

1529
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,040
they're going to say, well, it's a GMO, right? So, it's going to be really hard to get regulatory approval,

1530
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,840
companies are going to have trouble growing it. So, we're not going to fund that. And that's

1531
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,280
happened the last 15 years, it's very hard. But the one kind of funding can still get a little bit of

1532
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:54,160
is, if you want to say, well, we need better safety technology. We need to not worry so much about

1533
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,240
getting better trees, but getting safer trees. And so, that's really that little niche has allowed me

1534
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,960
to set a continued doing research. I do want genetic containment and so forth. And so, that's one of

1535
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,040
the ways I've been able to keep doing what I believe is interesting and important. Getting the

1536
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,080
science done, testing it in the field, and me it's very important, not just that I do laboratory work,

1537
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,840
because you need to go out into a real-the-real world, the most laboratory ideas don't actually

1538
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,120
work, because the world is complicated. And so, I thought I have stuff out. I have 10 acres growing

1539
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:32,000
in Kravales now that are testing ideas from the field, from the laboratory. And anyway,

1540
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,600
but it's this safety orientation that's allowed me to keep productive, keep doing good science,

1541
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,640
even though the social milieu is extremely adverse and funding is very hard to get.

1542
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,200
So, the work on bio-safety and sterile nursery plants has almost been the survival strategy

1543
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,640
in your point. Exactly, yeah. And it's survival, but it's also something I said, I'm interested in

1544
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,640
and when I started that construction, started working on poppers, I said, we need to figure out

1545
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,160
containment. And so, I'm still doing that. And luckily, that hasn't dried up. You know,

1546
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,440
you know, it couldn't be time, but it hasn't so far. And I do work that is state-of-the-art.

1547
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,560
It's competitive throughout science and throughout agriculture. So, these are the panel

1548
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,280
that funds this. This is mainly USDA panel called biotechnology risk assessment that

1549
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,240
that won the ARS thing that he just mentioned was a separate thing related to it. But that's

1550
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,960
funding all of agriculture. So, all we have to be doing work on trees that is competitive with

1551
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,200
the very best work in corn. And that's hard because they have a lot more money and there are a lot

1552
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,080
more advanced genetics. But I'm proud that I've been able to do that. I can compete with those guys.

1553
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,640
It's a science we do is just as good. If I didn't, if I didn't, that's not all I probably couldn't,

1554
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,080
but I can do it in popular. Something else for your view that caught my was the project on

1555
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,720
carbon sequestration using top opportunities. Yeah, about that. Yeah, well, you know,

1556
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,760
you know, it's interesting. It's a very, if you decide you're going to grow trees seriously for some purpose.

1557
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:12,560
I mean, they're going to have a dominant dedicated use. What nature gives you is okay,

1558
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,360
and you can tweak it further, but often you want something very different. And so,

1559
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:24,560
my people do ecological modeling started saying, well, you know, if we produce trees that

1560
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:32,640
had more roots and less stem, which is contrary to what people do in forestry, they tend to want

1561
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,760
the fastest growing tallest tree. And I said, no, maybe we don't want the tallest one. Maybe we want

1562
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,400
the fastest one with lots of roots. And the roots will add to the carbon of the soil and decay

1563
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,480
much slower than stem material would. Maybe maybe we could even make the roots so they decay more

1564
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,320
slowly and enhance the amount of terpenides and phenolics, these compounds that's slowed down,

1565
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,600
decomposition, so the carbon stays around on the soil longer. So it's those ideas that we could

1566
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:07,520
change in the allocation between tops and bottoms and change the chemistry of roots that would

1567
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,520
promote carbon sequestration. That was the idea. We also thought, if we had a tree that has more roots,

1568
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:20,560
it'll survive great stresses. It'll wire remediate soils better. We also have a problem in

1569
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,600
industry that sometimes you select the fastest growing trees and this has happened in the Northwest

1570
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,640
with Poppers, they blow down. We get these giant windstorms every now and then and they just blow over.

1571
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:37,680
And so, and that also we have an agriculture, the green revolution, which is not a biotech

1572
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:45,760
GML thing, but it's a bunch of technologies starting in about the 1960s. The key one is a scientist

1573
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,800
figured out that we don't want taller wheat, we don't want taller rice, when you just select

1574
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,240
for productivity, everything gets taller. And then you have a storm, they blow over their lodge,

1575
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,440
and you've probably seen this around Pendleton that happens occasionally. And then the crop

1576
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,760
is lost at rocks, the quality is closed. So what the scientists did is they found a dwarfism

1577
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,000
gene, semi dwarfism, that keeps the wheat instead of being in a way over your head and keeps it

1578
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,360
about here. And most of the wheat we see around, or again, is like that. But that's a particular gene

1579
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:23,280
brought in from an Asian variety that constrains you from getting tall. So it gets more roots,

1580
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,800
so it gets more, more seeds on it, and it doesn't launch. So it was also that thinking that

1581
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,440
you know, maybe we can sequester more carbon, have a tree that's more drought tolerant by remediates

1582
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,960
better by having them be shorter. And I'm not talking about three feet tall, I'm just a tree.

1583
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,760
So instead of a hundred feet, you might be sixty feet, whatever, between slow it down and change

1584
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,560
the distribution and the quality of the biomass. And so that's what that project was about.

1585
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,400
Trying to tweak these trees for these particular goals. And we were successful at it. We did,

1586
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,680
and some of the genes we tested were genes from the green revolution in wheat. And because the

1587
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,120
mechanisms are very fundamental, they work quite well. And so we were able to get shorter trees

1588
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,000
with more roots. And but was anybody going to use them? No, because they're a GMO, and because

1589
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,760
they are, it would change the industry. Industry doesn't work that we're breeding,

1590
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,920
we're going to have to be radically different. We have to get a GMO probably into the breeding

1591
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,880
program. Because one of the things you're doing is you're creating trees that are smaller,

1592
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,400
who grow as fast while in nature, those trees die, right? Because they can't get light.

1593
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:38,080
So you'd have to change the whole way you breed trees and evaluate them. And anyway, it would be

1594
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,040
very disruptive to the industry. But with the GMO element of it, it was an on-starter. So we did the

1595
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,800
work, it was successful. And there it is. The science is done. Does somebody ever want to pick it up?

1596
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:54,160
You know, I don't know. But that's what that was about, the short of it. Yeah.

1597
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,720
And that was a project that had an association with Sungram. Is that correct?

1598
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,240
That's right. Yeah. That was a Department of Energy USDA funded. It was a couple of them.

1599
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,240
The biggest funding we got was from the biofuels section of the Department of Energy.

1600
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,720
That was a big, and then we had some supplementary funding from other places. We've also got

1601
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,400
funding from the Sungram and a couple other places on trying to make a tree that would have some

1602
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:26,320
valuable co-products. So one of the problems with growing bioenergy is that energy is cheap in the

1603
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,000
world. Unless we tax fossil fuels really aggressively, which we're not, almost anywhere,

1604
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,480
as aggressively as it probably should be, they're not competitive. So how do you make them more

1605
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:43,040
competitive? One of the ways is to engineer in some product that is high value, a new biochemical

1606
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,000
that would be have some other higher use in industry. So we've tried to get trees that produce

1607
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,440
bioplastics, things that you can use, and we're already using the similar versions

1608
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,280
from bacteria, these cops that decompose, that you can put in the compost. We tried to make the same

1609
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,760
kind of thing in the palper trees, and we did it, but we couldn't make enough to make it economic.

1610
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,920
So we really need a major engineering leap to make that work. And so we're just no funding for it,

1611
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,920
but it's also a hard problem. But that's one of the Sungram projects that was about

1612
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
trying to figure out how to make those biofuels. I mean, collaborating with companies that

1613
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,480
were doing in a different crops, and it's a hard problem. We still, I thought a student who sort of

1614
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,840
working on an element topic, but it would require a pretty serious effort. Yeah. Has any of your work

1615
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:38,800
intersected with the cross-layer-related products at all? Only that the short answer is no. I was

1616
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:45,840
at a conference. The Panko Foundation is as far as true foundation funded by this. I assume

1617
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,120
rich guy who really wants to infuse advanced engineering technology of all kinds to make better

1618
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,400
wood products, including the laminated products for Oregon and for the industry. You know, why

1619
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,800
aren't we doing genetic engineering? He's looking at all the amazing things in engineering,

1620
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,280
you know, in the traditional sense, why not genetic engineering? And I went to this conference

1621
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,680
with other engineers, and I told him that it's the broader social element. And it's also that

1622
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,040
the industry is not ready for it because we're still sort of in the neolithic breeding wise. And so it

1623
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,600
would just be like trying to teach a baby to run before it's able to walk and just didn't make sense.

1624
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,240
He didn't want to hear that, but that's the reality of it. You know, so it could be done. And you know,

1625
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,400
if we, but before we did that, for example, if you're going to add the precision of genetic engineering

1626
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,240
to try to get the fibers to set a be bonded in a way that would be better for CLT or glue better,

1627
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,280
whatever it might be, the first thing you want to do is just homogenize the wood. So you know,

1628
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,680
you, you, so as an engineer, you want to know what's going to be a certain thing. And then you can

1629
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,480
tweak it right. And right now, in our forest, the variability in wood properties is incredible.

1630
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:00,400
So you first want to be able to probably clone trees. And the problem with that is that it's

1631
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,520
not affordable in the industry right now. So unless you get to that, that's again, you know,

1632
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,080
a crawl walk before you run. We're not going to get there. So I also told in that the industry,

1633
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,080
until we can get to those barriers, I'm not ready for it. And that's a matter of economics.

1634
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,720
And probably also social acceptability. Would it be okay to have clone Douglass for all over the

1635
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:25,680
landscape? I don't know. Well, with a serial club site, they probably hate the idea. So, you know,

1636
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:34,400
so I just, but due to economics, plus concern, it's just not happening. Yeah. Tell me about the

1637
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,320
Leopold Leadership Program. I got that with something fairly important to you. Yeah, that really is a,

1638
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:45,600
I was a, that's a great thing. And it, you know, resonates today. So, Jane Looktanko, I know

1639
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,880
as you understand this professor, you know, president of AAAA National Academy member, you know,

1640
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:58,320
amazing scientist in person. She and some colleagues said, you know, scientists don't have the skills

1641
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:04,000
and the network to communicate with the media and decision makers, like they need to, you know,

1642
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,560
and her interest was in getting more environmental science and science in general,

1643
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,240
into policy, you know, and most politicians don't have science backgrounds, almost none of them do.

1644
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,640
And so you need to talk their language. You need to know, you know, how they have decisions

1645
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,600
are made and you need to know how to talk to the media, you know, how to talk to science journalists,

1646
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:28,800
non-science journalists. So, they, she created this program. It was funded by various foundations

1647
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:34,160
over the years. It's still centered at Stanford, an organization at Stanford, it still goes on.

1648
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:42,240
And they train cohorts of something like 20 or so leading environmental scientists, people sort of

1649
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:49,600
in a make career, who you can see have been very successful and are going to make an impact and are called

1650
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:56,080
to speak to the world, to change the world. Very much like who I was growing up and who I still

1651
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:01,680
am. And so you apply, you say what you do, you know, your publication, my career, your passions,

1652
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:08,320
your skills. And so I was one, I think I may be the only person who would call himself a biotechnology

1653
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,920
in that program. It's mostly ecologists. A few lawyers involved, a couple of economists,

1654
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,400
but pretty much very strongly environmental people, people not so much working on the technology

1655
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,400
side of it. But anyway, this group has been going on now. I'm going to guess 20 years,

1656
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,320
something like that, but they have these cohorts of scientists who come through and a lot of them

1657
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,720
are now, you know, very well established in the field. And there's a network of them and they

1658
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,240
communicate and they collaborate and they try to organize action or let us to the editor and

1659
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,680
conferences. So, particularly now, with all the things going on on the chopper administration,

1660
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,720
it's kind of been, you know, come back to life. And when they're really trying to do things and so

1661
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,480
for. And so anyway, that's, I'm part of that organization and, you know, I love to see information

1662
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,560
that's share about how to be more effective. What do you do now is a scientist? What's the

1663
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,200
right thing to do? There's a discussion going on about whether it's good or bad to engage in the

1664
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:16,480
March for Science next month. Is that politicizing science more? Making us more of a special

1665
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,480
interest group versus, you know, arbiters of truth or are not, or we have to. And so that's an example

1666
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,960
of how that network helps. People think distributed information and it's very nice. You know,

1667
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,480
like I said, I'm a, I'm kind of an outsider in it. And I kind of feel like when it comes to GMO,

1668
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,240
those in biotechnology and agriculture, probably the majority of them are a negative on it. You

1669
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,880
know, and I'm kind of a lone wolf there in saying, this is powerful. We just have to use it right.

1670
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,680
So, you know, so I'm, I'm a, I'm a housing that and it's important to me. But it's also a network of

1671
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,200
environmental scientists that are mostly, I'm not interested in the kind of stuff that I do. So,

1672
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,880
anyway, there it is. I'm not, I'm not super active in a bi name means probably because as I said,

1673
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,560
it doesn't, it's kind of a little bit to the, to the left, whatever it is, where I'm at in terms of

1674
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:14,480
using technology in the world. Can you talk a bit more about GMOs with respect to food? That's

1675
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,640
obviously a big issue for people. Yeah, you know, I followed that pretty intense of a teacher

1676
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:26,320
batter at OSU have been doing that at this outreach program. It's very hot and very political,

1677
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:31,440
and, you know, I think one thing that's really clear is that it's, it's mostly not about the science.

1678
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:39,520
I think the people who are very against GMOs want to make it about very dangerous

1679
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:46,880
in adequately studied science. And I just think for them, that's a tool, a tactic. I think

1680
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:56,720
the people in the know no better than that. So, but as you know, there's issues of intensive,

1681
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,480
part of the biggest issue is industrial agriculture in general, you know, and it's incredible benefits

1682
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,520
and incredible harms. You know, probably plowing is the most damaging thing we do the whole planet.

1683
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,000
But it's not just industrial agriculture, the plows, it's organic agriculture and everybody else,

1684
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:21,520
and they often do it more. So, you know, and then you have use of agricultural chemicals

1685
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:29,040
which are an incredible energy saver and productivity enhancer, but they can be used with

1686
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,920
they can harm things, you know, the racial car system, the science brain helps show that for DBT.

1687
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,960
And so now we're in a whole different era than we were back then where things are intensively

1688
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,400
regulated and monitored and many bad things have been taken off markets and, you know, at least in the

1689
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:50,640
Western world and to get a chemical approved, you know, it takes, I think, hundreds of millions of

1690
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,000
dollars of tests and studies and the labels that restrict its use and so forth. So, there's a lot of

1691
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,920
safeguards built into the system we didn't have back in the old days, but it's a good enough.

1692
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,760
Now, it's not going to be perfect. We're going to make some mistakes. So, how do you think about

1693
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:11,200
chemicals used in agriculture and you have systems like the organic certification system that's a

1694
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,960
we won't use any, except actually for quite a long list of exceptions if you read the details.

1695
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:26,480
But, so that's another element and the major GMO crops now use chemicals directly or indirectly.

1696
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,440
They use chemicals in the form or promoting herbicides by being herbicide resistant.

1697
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:38,560
They use chemicals in the sense of isolating a pesticide from a bacterium and putting it into plants.

1698
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,520
And this pesticide, this something called BT, is one that's widely used in our organic agriculture.

1699
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,560
So, it's very, very, very safe. And I've spiced it into a plant when now it's supposed to be very unsafe.

1700
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:58,320
So, you know, there's all, but anyway, but it involves things like chemicals and it involves

1701
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,840
intensity, PA regulation. And the more you regulate doesn't mean that people feel better about it,

1702
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:12,240
it means it actually shines a big spotlight on it. And so, it's just extremely messy, both from a society

1703
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:18,240
and so, of course, the science continues to grow and innovate. So, there's new stuff all the time.

1704
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:27,200
So, how much regulation just impedes public benefits, impedes economic development versus

1705
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:33,040
protects the public and the environment. And getting that right is crucial. And, you know,

1706
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,080
I'm by no means a supporter of the current presidential administration in the particular individual,

1707
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,600
but the issue of how much regulation is too much is a really hard technical one. And the

1708
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,800
sound bites you get and all of these media are generally misleading and wrong. But in the area of biotech

1709
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,520
and I've written a lot, I think the regulations are totally out of control. There are some kinds of

1710
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,240
biotech that should be intensively regulated. Probably more than we have now. Other kinds really

1711
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:03,600
does. There's good record that there's no regulation needed at all. Zero. We have this thing called gene editing,

1712
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,920
the new technology from modifying the natural DNA there to, for strange reasons, which is what

1713
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,600
breeding does, but now we do it with science and precision. That's probably going to be regulated,

1714
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,720
certainly in Europe, like it's taking the gene from the far away species. It's from my claim,

1715
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,000
just crazy. This is the CRISPR technique. Yeah, this is the CRISPR technique. But that's kind of,

1716
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,640
and that's a big source of controversy right now. The USDA put out a proposal to not regulate

1717
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,040
some parts of that, which I think is innovative and forward-looking. I don't know what's going to happen

1718
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,840
under the current administration. And Europe is a very likely good that way. Either way, the organic

1719
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:48,960
people have already said on record they will not accept it. So, you know, it's just an ugly messy

1720
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:56,000
area, frankly. And it's right with trade-offs. I just gave a talk last night to my own laboratory group.

1721
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:04,000
There was a very good way for lately on the record of GMO crops in terms of pesticide use.

1722
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,440
To use more, to use less, to use better kinds of chemicals. And the reality is it's a mixed bag.

1723
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,480
We're doing all that depending on the crop and the time frame and it's just, that's the reality of it.

1724
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,520
But we know there's also billions of benefits to the economy. We know there's also improved soil

1725
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:27,920
as a result. So, what's the right answer? So, if you like sort of simple answers, this is not the

1726
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:34,720
area for you. So, that's sort of, I try to, when I speak about a peachy batter, I try to give

1727
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:41,520
students a sense of both the frustration and anger at this simple-minded social response,

1728
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:48,240
no GMO labels. Organic certification. I'm cleaner and better than you. And the reason of that,

1729
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:55,520
people go to organic now. So, boy, GMOs. Regulations are so intense that breeders like me,

1730
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,640
I could be breeding populists for Oregon using GMO techniques, except that a cost amount of

1731
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:10,000
$100 million to release one variety. Even with CRISPR, it's just like. On the other hand,

1732
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,400
you know, we have companies overusing our designs and creating our desired resistant weeds.

1733
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,320
So, it's just really complicated and difficult, you know. So, my own personal point of view is

1734
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:28,640
don't throw out the 80 with a bathwater. You know, take some intelligent milling around. But that's

1735
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,520
not where society is at in terms of marketing and labels. That's not where regulations tend to be.

1736
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:39,600
The regulations reflect people's fears. Regulators like to say they're science-based,

1737
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,400
nowhere are they really science-based, they try. They're always trying, but the political pressure is

1738
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,000
incredible. In the U.S. and in Europe, to actually make a science-based decision and the

1739
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
the activist groups work so hard to influence the science, to get their people on the boards

1740
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:02,240
and to change the way decisions are made. So, again, you know, I used to be a member of Greenpeace

1741
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:07,440
in the Arab club in Friends of the Earth and all these guys and now I wouldn't give them a dollar.

1742
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:13,680
So, you know, that's where I started, right? And now I don't trust them. I give a lot of money to

1743
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,640
certain of our net floor organizations like the Nature Conservancy that are really science-based,

1744
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,080
but these guys are not. So, who's the good guys anymore? So, anyway, in the whole food, GMO,

1745
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,360
food biotechnology, you get all that. The good guys are the bad guys, the bad guys, the good guys,

1746
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:38,960
how do you decide? Yeah, I have a, I have a note here to ask you about the future of forests.

1747
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,640
Yeah, right, because yeah, a big question, but yeah, and here in your target, it feels

1748
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,920
to be like, a lot of what you're doing now, you're creating work that might be used in the future

1749
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,560
in a different environment. Yeah, and I think that's right. Is it fair to assume you think that the

1750
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,560
future forests might ensemble would depend upon genetic engineering? Well, you know, I've made

1751
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:07,120
the argument, one thing you have in the world with climate change, with people traveling around the

1752
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:13,760
world, with pests evolving, ever more fast. The stress is on forests or enormous. There's, you know,

1753
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:20,000
various papers recording, you know, a hundred of introduced and new pests that are damaging

1754
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,960
forests everywhere. It's incredible, difficult thing. And, you know, the main way we deal with that

1755
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:33,440
is through bio-control, conventional breeding, but sometimes those don't work. And so one case,

1756
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,800
you may know the story of the American Chestnut, I don't know if you're familiar with that, it's a

1757
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,840
species that was a dominant species, much like Douglas Furrow around here, all over the East Coast,

1758
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:49,040
entirely destroyed by an exotic fungus. And so that was a hundred years ago, and now people have

1759
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:54,160
been working through conventional breeding and bio-control to the story, and so far, not much

1760
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:01,360
luck. And so scientists in the State University of New York has found, he studied the mechanism

1761
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:07,760
of disease, the pathogenesis, how it really works. And it's like other pathogens where he's found

1762
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:13,680
that they produce this thing called an oxalic acid that actually is what kill statisticians,

1763
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,000
it produces an oxalic acid, it kills the tissues, and the fungus acts as kind of a

1764
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,560
saprophied, and just basically eats the dead tissue. And I said, well, if we can just get rid of

1765
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,240
their oxalic acid or turn it way down, maybe we'll turn it from that pathogen into a saprophied.

1766
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:33,200
It'll still be around, but it's not going to really damage trees. So we did, he's done that.

1767
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,400
Kind of an amazing thing. He took a gene from wheat. In fact, put it into chestnut and

1768
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,520
he's a peer-to-peer resistant. So there's a case where genetic engineering was important,

1769
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,120
and it was able to very, very quickly do what breeding other techniques couldn't do. And so that's

1770
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:54,400
kind of a well-known case, but then we have lots of other species that are sort of an earlier

1771
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:03,520
stages of that same devastation. There's Emerald Ashbore, there's Hanlocke delgid, a few other

1772
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,000
things around the world that are in that category, what looks really bad for the species.

1773
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,840
So from my point of view, when you have a crisis like that, you want to use all of your tools.

1774
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,160
And genetic engineering is definitely one. When you come in, you don't say, well, what genetic

1775
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:22,960
variation, the tree species has is going to have to be good enough. You say, what are all the tools

1776
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,360
I have? And if a guy at St. University of New York or elsewhere says, I think I understand how this

1777
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,520
pathogen works. Let's take a gene and move it. Let's tweak a native gene. Maybe we have,

1778
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,080
we do have some things that are somewhat similar and chestnut, but we need to edit it. We need

1779
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,680
to do CRISPR to change it. And let's do it faster, because this is an emergency to get this out

1780
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:49,360
and start testing it, right? We can't wait for 20 years of regulatory analysis of ecological approval.

1781
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,160
But we can't do that. Can't do that today, because of the rules and the regulations and people's

1782
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,920
phobias, and the inability of companies to see that they could ever use such a trade. So there's

1783
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:08,320
almost no investment in that kind of technology. And to me, that makes no sense. That's just,

1784
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:19,360
when you're, you know, the line between precaution and paranoia, precaution is sort of, you know,

1785
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:24,560
taking intelligent measures to, you know, look before you leave, paranoia is being so afraid

1786
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,280
and building an institutional system that's based on fear. And that's, I think that's where

1787
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:36,880
our app, which you know, it, it makes no sense. So, you know, anyway, so I think it could be a powerful

1788
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:43,120
technology for the future. All trees could be semi-dorth in a future time if people were to actually

1789
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,520
allow that to happen, and maybe they'd be more productive and more stress resistant, but we're not

1790
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:54,800
going to know in my lifetime if that's sure or not. So, you know, you know, so I think this

1791
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,640
powerful things we could do that, I think the uses would be selected. These really more

1792
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:04,160
agree just cases that I mentioned, because conventional breeding is very powerful, and there's

1793
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,960
essentially no limit to it. You could take a species from anywhere around the world and move

1794
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,560
it here to Oregon and if it works, you know, it's fine. So that's radical genetic engineering,

1795
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,240
and we can do that without any constraints, but if you tweak a gene, there's these huge constraints

1796
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:26,480
in issues. So why mess with tweaking genes when you can do that other stuff? So, you know, we sort of

1797
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:32,720
paint that ourselves into this corner if you want them, you know, a bit. So, we graduate students

1798
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,880
have soon come to your lab because they're attracted by your work and want to pursue similar

1799
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,120
topics. What do you tell them? I mean, it sounds to me like, yeah, you hit a time period of

1800
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,760
yeah, of cultural history, I suppose, where you could have the work that you did,

1801
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,320
right? But that window is closed. Well, I tell them, you know, I tell them, if you think you're going

1802
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:56,960
to graduate and get a job in the forest industry, doing biotechnology, the job opportunities are

1803
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,360
extremely small. So, I tell them you have to be competitive with any agricultural biotechnologist.

1804
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,080
You need to be able to get a job at one of those companies or at the USDA that's still doing

1805
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:14,320
some of this, particularly for serious diseases. And you need to have what I call a bioinformatics

1806
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:20,240
training. Meaning that, you know, putting the GML thing aside, you need to be able to do a state

1807
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,840
of your computational biology, which doesn't involve DMOs because that's the on trade to where

1808
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,240
most jobs are in, you know, in the broad area of biotech science. So, you know, but otherwise, a lot

1809
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,320
of them come to me because they're motivated by the things we're talking about. They want to see

1810
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,720
the world change because they see how powerful genetic engineering is. They see all of this

1811
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,280
information out there including from the good guys. And they're, they're, they're, they're angry

1812
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,240
on their passionate. So, you know, I tell them, you know, I just wind open. This is the reality.

1813
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,560
So, that's what they say. But, but again, it's really critical. They do state-of-the-art work.

1814
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,680
It just happens to be on trees. And then, they're going to post doc and now be able to move into

1815
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:06,080
other areas. A couple of concluding questions that I'm interested in your perspective on

1816
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,880
change in the college of forestry that changes very visible to everybody, right? No,

1817
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,640
it's as if they call work PV always. Yeah. But tell me how the college has changed and moved

1818
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:22,160
in different directions and the years of your association. Yeah, you know, I think we have a great

1819
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:28,720
leader and, you know, Dean Thomas Mann is very visionary who really wants to move the college ahead

1820
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:35,360
very powerfully he wants to sort of move into the environmental mainstream if he can. He's trying

1821
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:40,160
to build much better bridges with environmental organizations than we've had historically.

1822
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:45,600
He wants to reduce the polarization we've had amongst the more in pro-industry and the pro-environment

1823
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:52,720
folks. And I think that's happening over time successfully. He wants to move into the

1824
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:58,400
advanced, you know, laminated technologies and this new building that's, you know, a big part

1825
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:04,000
of the money and the push to do that kind of thing. I think that's really positive.

1826
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,640
Colleges also now in different parts of campus and that's heard sort of a sense of unity

1827
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:15,040
that we have. So, you know, I think, I think he's trying to set us on the right path and do the

1828
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:20,880
right thing and I hope he can bring his vision through the completion, but I think that's set

1829
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,520
of unknown right now. What kind of impact do you think the new forestry complex might have on the

1830
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,200
college? Well, you know, I think new buildings have discussed in this with various colleagues.

1831
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:38,080
You know, it's obviously a big cost. But, you know, the environment you live and work in matters,

1832
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:44,880
it matters to how you feel, how you interact with people. I'm in Richards and Hall, which was

1833
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:52,000
about 15 or 19 years old, but it was designed with lots of light, lots of wood and it's brought

1834
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,400
people together. It's been, you know, had its own little design flaws. We found out, expect that

1835
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:02,000
keeping out things like rain. You know, it's a really beautiful environment. And so I think he wants

1836
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,640
to take back to another level and create really a sense of greenness and collaboration and, you know,

1837
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:16,640
an innovation that I think a new building helps to motivate. So, you know, I like the idea and I,

1838
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,960
you know, I think there was criticism about whether it was green enough and how green you need to

1839
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:26,560
be to tear down an existing functional building, but also quite old fashioned and not a great

1840
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,520
collaborative space at all. Very much in the old model of people basically in file cabinets.

1841
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:39,440
So, you know, I think I think there's not a lot to try to be green while also making it

1842
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:44,720
something you can sell to donors because donors don't want to invest in, you know, changing the

1843
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,760
siding and existing building if they want to invest in an vision. And so, I think you didn't

1844
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,240
really have a choice but to create a new building. So, you know, I'm hoping that, you know, that

1845
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,680
the dean comes back and the building is as beautiful and as functional as you hope it will be

1846
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,440
helps, you know, bring us to another level. So, but right now, I think we're in this kind of precarious

1847
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:11,040
place where you're a two-out, I'm happy in that building. And all building projects I know of,

1848
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,760
it costs more than you think. And then you have to make difficult decisions as you go and

1849
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,000
does it actually do everything you thought you were going to do with it. So, I think there's those

1850
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:27,600
risks as well, but I'm hoping. Yeah. In my last question, a few, this is a SESCO Centennial

1851
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,960
project and then I'm interested in your point of view on the university as it looks towards its

1852
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:40,080
150th birthday, where do you think I'll see this position right now? Yeah, I really felt really

1853
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:45,440
fortunate to be part of this institution for the 30th and going on that 30th year that I've been here.

1854
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,280
I've got the leadership that I've had in the college of fire. She's been excellent.

1855
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,920
John Barr and Ed Ray, I think have been, you know, inspiring and responsible leaders.

1856
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,000
I have not gotten involved in administration significantly. So, like, every other type of

1857
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:09,120
member, I know I wonder if we are investing far too much given our limited state budgets in

1858
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:15,840
administrators, they just seem to be everywhere. So, I wonder whether every administrator is

1859
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:23,200
really needed and what they're doing, what their impact is. But in general, I like the ethics

1860
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:30,640
and the structure of the place and I'm proud to be a part of it. So, you know, I like the emphasis

1861
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,000
that we have on equity and diversity here and I think that's really important. You know, Oregon

1862
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,440
is a very white place and it's a white place or institutional reasons. In my opinion, those need

1863
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,760
to be corrected and addressed. So, I'm proud that we're doing that pretty actively. We're doing

1864
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:53,360
it pretty actively in forestry as well. So, I think that's the right thing to do. So, you know,

1865
01:25:53,360 --> 01:26:00,960
in general, I feel good about it. I would love to see more of the administration explain

1866
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,280
who they are, what they do, and how cost effective they are. And they don't seem to feel they

1867
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:10,880
need to do it. So, I don't think that's right. So, in that regard, you know, I would love a little

1868
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:18,320
bit more of a business sense of explaining to faculty how they're making smart decisions and what

1869
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,680
the administrative decisions that they make really cost as compared to, you know, I don't know

1870
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:31,680
could we have 10% less administration, 10% or 50% more faculty members doing innovative

1871
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,400
research and teaching. You know, I just, those tradeoffs, I don't understand them. And I don't

1872
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:41,120
know anybody does because I don't think administrators feel the need to explain them to, to

1873
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:47,440
play the ins life meat. And I know I don't like that. So, anyway, but so, in general, very positive,

1874
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:53,040
but you know, with some sense that maybe we have some runaway administrative investments. And

1875
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:58,240
I think that's a common problem in higher education, you know, so as far as I understand it. So,

1876
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:02,800
how do you rate that in? How do you at least understand it and decide if you agree with it or not?

1877
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,240
Yeah, certainly not the first time I've heard that. Yeah, but in short, I mean, I feel privileged

1878
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:14,480
to have been here. The community has been an extraordinary place for me to live and raise my

1879
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:21,120
children. And, you know, as when I go back to my Yale reunions and those folks are all over the world

1880
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:25,520
and they say, hey, you know, you travel everywhere. Where would be your ideal place to live?

1881
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,160
I always say, I'm living there. I travel the world too and this is a incredible place today.

1882
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,040
So, that's a good note to stop on. Thank you very much. So, you really appreciate this.
