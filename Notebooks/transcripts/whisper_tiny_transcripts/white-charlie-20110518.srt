1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So we are lucky enough to be here this morning to interview Charlie White and it's May

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
18th, 2000 and 11th.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's to thank you so much for agreeing to do this.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to start off with just asking you to tell us your earliest recollections, where

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
you're born, what year, and where you grew up.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was born and Detroit Michigan, and in the court, I was the youngest of nine children.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Four brothers and four sisters, and all over the court.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are two of us left, and myself and the brother next to me.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was a typical child, we were poor, but I said that's not really know.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I never stopped.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I always said food.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I always had a roof over my head, and when I closed, and the old sand was cardboard,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the shoe we had a few of those shoes.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I was just a typical child of those days.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What kind of things do you remember doing as a child playing games?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, of course.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My brother, next to me, I've walked kind of follow-up and it's what's there.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He played basketball, and he played in high school.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He didn't go to college, but he played high school.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, I used to watch his games, and we've hit the playgrounds on the weekend.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We've sat every morning at the break of dawn.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We were out in the alleys and on the playgrounds playing basketball.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There was more like a religion.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We played all kinds of sports, and contrary to property to relief.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There was a pretty good hockey player's in my neighborhood.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We played hockey, and we played tennis and all that, but basketball just became the sport.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
basketball and football.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a good baseball player's trip.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The basketball became the game of choice, and I played YMCA.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Jewish Community Center.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But also one thing I did when I was 10 years old.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's 19 years old.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I used to swim for the YMCA.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I wasn't too bad, but we transferred it closer to a place near my home.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And everybody left the YMCA.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The coach left and everybody followed him.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We used to swim against the cross-town teams, from the country clubs, and all that.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We just pretty good against the YMCA.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So swimming was big to me for about three, four years from about nine until about 13.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was still playing basketball, but I did.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I just swimming in the evening at people.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sure.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But that's basically what you call growing up.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right around the racialization of Detroit was there.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You said you swim against the kids in the country club today.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So having kind of feeling towards you guys.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, they did, but nothing was said.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They just felt, you know, they had that superior feeling that they were better.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Because they had the best, much better facilities.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And we were at decent facilities, but they had to country clubs and the whole thing.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And, but you know, that feeling was there.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And it was always there that we wanted to win.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was a, Detroit was a, I love Detroit, but it was, it was polarized.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean, most of the Blacks lived in about three or four different areas.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And the Italians lived here.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And Jewish people lived there.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And the Polish people lived on the PlayScore of HMG.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sure.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And great athletes came out at HMG.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And that was like, didn't be high schools in HMG.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we played against each other in, in, throughout the city.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But it was mostly, there was only one,

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that I could remember, one school at that time,

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that had mixed athletic teams.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that was cast tech, which was one of the top schools in the city.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Roughly, by year, you were talking about,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in the mid 50s.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So your high school, as I'm hearing you say,

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it was not being segregated.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, it was just.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, I went to cast tech.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I did.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
To begin with, but I didn't stay there ended up back in my neighborhood school.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But, yeah, the neighborhood school that I played the most basketball in was,

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
it was not segregated.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The cast tech was.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And they have always said pretty good teams.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But, you know, it was pretty much it.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I did a lot of odd jobs growing up as a kid to generate income.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I learned this from all my brothers and sisters.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They all worked in school and did all of things.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They all graduated from high school.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
None of what the college I was the only one.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But, I worked for, you know, cutting lawns, washing windows, you know, whatever.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sure.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then I got a job with large grocery chain, progress.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I started working in a meat department,

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
just kind of cleaning up and everything.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then I ended up getting a permanent job as a stock boy.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And, you know, you thought, okay.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And the job was rough in the neighborhood.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I mean, you had to kind of establish yourself.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But, sure.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I decided in 1958 that I had seen enough,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and the friend of mine and I decided to,

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
say, let's go see the world and join the military.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And we could have gone in for two years and gone to the Far East.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But I said, now let's go in for three and go to Europe.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're going to be seeing a few more places.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And that's what happened.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And you were about 18.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
18.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
18.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
20.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
20.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Almost 20.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
19.

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So I started, and I played a lot of basketball, and I was there.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In the military.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can you talk about that?

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, we came in.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I went in and into four knots.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A little bit right aside a little bit.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And they had a,

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Can't team.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I went out for it.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But I didn't want to have been ordered to make that team.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You had to kind of stay in the states and you travel around.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I said, don't want to stay here.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I want to go to Europe.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I kind of got on the team there and we played.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We could be at like 50 games, schedules.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then we heard in the Soviet.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
At the series.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And then I played a lot of games.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I enjoyed myself.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, we went to, went all over.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're in, all over Germany.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Right.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And that time.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The military was disagreed.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So you were actually.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So you were actually.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
With white teammates.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you were there with several racial issues in the military.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Can you talk about those?

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The majority of MPs were military police were white and from the south.

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And they harassed us.

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Consistently.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Whenever we would be out.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There was one.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There was one African guy there named Bobby.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Something other.

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And he had a club.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Very nice, popular club.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And we would go down there.

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And you know what?

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Twice a month.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And these were coming.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Just kind of read the club.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know, pull everybody out.

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's good.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And coffee.

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You know.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We, our team used to go down there.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, this was a track team at this time.

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And we had white kids on the track team.

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And they would tell them to go home.

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Which they wouldn't go.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They would stay with us and they would take us.

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know, to jail the lockup.

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But we'd get out the next couple hours because we called our.

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Colonel and blah, blah, blah.

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You know, it was just a rest.

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sure.

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And it's just, it's just continued.

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sure.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We continue.

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What else?

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Some of your experiences in Germany has.

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I'm.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What position did you have in the military then?

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because it wasn't just fully accurate.

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right.

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You had a regular job.

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was just a.

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That was an armoured infantry.

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What they called it.

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I didn't spend a lot of stuff.

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, no.

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I spent what they called TDWI.

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was a temporary duty.

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I would play sports.

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, because I also was on the track team.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, I didn't even know they had to.

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay.

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not high jumped.

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And triple jumped and brought jumped.

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It was a nice long jump.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mm-hmm.

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Whatever.

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But yeah, I did that too.

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I did that too.

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Pretty much keep from.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't do it anymore.

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Every duty is guaranteed.

229
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right, right.

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Kids in patrol.

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was such a thing.

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right.

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

235
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So did someone recognize you in the military as being a potential athlete

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
for eventually college or how did that team talk to me now about how?

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was really funny.

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We were in a gym one day and I was shooting around.

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And this kid from Southern California.

240
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's on our team.

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Jones.

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dick Jones.

243
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He came in the gym and he asked me, see, what are you going to do?

244
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're getting close to my time to come back.

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Three states.

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And he said, what are you going to do when you got a military officer?

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You know, I really hadn't thought much about it.

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And he said, you got to go out to California and go to junior college and say,

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
junior college is free and then maybe you can get a scholarship to a four year school.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I thought he was joking.

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So I threw the ball out and told him to get out and chase them out of the gym.

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, guess what happened.

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I did just that.

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I got a certificate of four in your firm Germany.

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Got out of the army went to junior college.

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then came with Durgen State.

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now, the thing that I noticed when I got here, I started seeing names in the paper from some

259
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
of the other junior colleges in Southern California, but as I knew from Detroit.

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So there was a lot of young kids kept from Detroit who came out to California and went to

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
junior college.

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What was that lot of you think?

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because we heard some very similar thing from North because he said that a lot of

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
guys from his neighborhood is in Washington, ended up in California.

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What was maybe going on back?

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, for one thing, the junior colleges back there were not free.

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We're free in East Coast.

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They were free out here.

269
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

270
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And if you were 21, you could establish residency and you did not have to pay out of state fees.

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So you could go to junior college free.

273
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And these coaches would help you get a little odd job here and there where you could work.

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And then you didn't have to scholarship to a four year school.

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So a lot of kids and plus, you know, who wouldn't want to come to California?

276
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Detroit, you know, I mean, it's snowed this high freezing.

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And there's a lot of different things going on.

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Guys were getting in trouble.

279
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Friends, relatives, you know, we're in that mix.

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So that you see as you pay, I mean, when I was about 17,

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I had to be 18 to go into the pool of halls, but everybody forward some kind of neighborhood.

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I used to hang around in the pool hall and, you know, see a lot of stuff going on.

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sure.

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So you want to get away from that, mainly.

286
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes, you know, just more future.

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

288
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just get out of that mix for a while.

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

290
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And that was, you know, they just got started coming.

291
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Once a couple of guys came.

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A lot of guys started coming.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I could say that I saw the guys names down in,

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and I had different places that from Detroit.

296
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And so I said, yeah, it was the best thing for me to do.

297
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But anyway, that's what I did.

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I came to Oregon, stayed in, you know.

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sure.

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to come back down to that.

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's great.

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So you're playing in a junior college.

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And someone identifies you and says,

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Who is that?

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know, a Paul and I were talking about that.

307
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't recall who it was.

308
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay.

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I think it was a sky that played with Paul.

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
His name was Doug.

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I don't remember his last name.

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was not a factor last time.

313
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think I heard he was in pretty poor health.

314
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But he and Paul played together.

315
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They were good friends.

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sure.

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I think he might've seen me play in some tournament.

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He lived in the general area.

319
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay.

320
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And Paul and told him about me.

321
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But one thing that had happened, the year before came,

322
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
where a slight skill came down to recruit me.

323
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

324
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They might've actually came to my house.

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They always see size.

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm not going to be married.

327
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I talk with him.

328
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know.

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And that didn't feel good.

330
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just didn't feel feel warm and fuzzy, I guess.

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Right.

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And then a couple of other coaches told me some stories about him.

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, that I probably would get to play with.

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And you know, sitting on the bench.

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And that sort of thing.

336
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Right.

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I said, well, that's not a good sign.

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So I just didn't come here.

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And then the next year when Paul came down and we set on and talked.

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like I said, I just felt it.

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Right.

343
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You know, you feel something.

344
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

345
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And like I said, when we talked about me graduating, I told him I need probably more than two years.

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He said, well, I can't give you that in writing.

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah.

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I promise you.

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

350
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll introduce you to you.

351
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That you graduate.

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know, anything over the two right need to graduate.

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Right.

354
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I felt that.

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then when I came up here, they focused on education right away as opposed to, you know,

356
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
just ask about and laid out what I needed to do.

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And then that's when I started taking classes.

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And you got through.

359
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You come back to your situation with the class deal.

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
At that point, the team was completely not to say it.

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The team was segregated in a sense.

363
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There was no African Americans.

364
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No.

365
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right.

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But in Southern California, there were actually work teams that were very, well, sure.

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Very few are mixed.

368
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sure.

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I wonder how, in your opinion, how did he, you think that he sort of rationalized that he wasn't

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
going to allow his team necessarily to have an edge.

371
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because at that point, I think it was really recognized that having African American players

372
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
on your team was a really an edge because they brought a different game to the game that

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Norm was actually talking to us about the game that he was forced to play.

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And that is a very kind of contrient.

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sure.

376
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Controlled control.

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

378
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It was that completely different.

379
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Running plays.

380
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah.

381
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Picking screens.

382
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We're in a playground that was, you know.

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He's got it done.

384
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We had a bag.

386
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Good to late.

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So whatever.

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, we were out in looping there before it came in the college.

389
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Sure.

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We throw the ball up.

391
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sure.

392
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You know, I really don't know.

393
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I try to figure this out because every year.

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And that's had some good teams.

395
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

396
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But every year, almost every year.

397
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
For two years, specifically, they're just focused hard.

399
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I know.

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

401
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Be a Russell.

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

403
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Was that the NSF?

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And they always played in the regions on the West Coast.

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And the West Coast teams used to beat him every time.

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And all of them always had players.

407
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They're called.

408
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Right.

409
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And I would have thought to myself.

410
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know.

412
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, I don't know.

413
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know, and you know, the thing that they mentioned about the quota thing they had.

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

415
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You start one at home.

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

417
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Two on the road.

418
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

419
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But be a Russell calling the phrase.

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You say, but five when you're behind.

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

422
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We're going to be a Russell started then.

423
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No.

424
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But I heard another explanation of that.

425
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You start one at home.

426
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah.

427
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And two on the road.

428
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

429
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Because you got to have somebody to room together.

430
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, interesting.

431
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

433
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sure.

436
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And also at that time.

437
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
In some parts of the country.

438
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You can find logic.

439
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

440
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
To black players.

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So, you know, if you had to go play in some areas.

442
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know, see how to like the old.

444
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
When Jackie Robinson was playing baseball.

445
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The team stayed here.

446
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And he found him a place to stay in the neighborhood.

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's someone's home.

448
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah.

449
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You know, like that.

450
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I know some coaches had mentioned that.

451
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And they were wary of where that in some sort of, you know, felt uncomfortable with that.

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Right.

453
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But I don't, I just don't know.

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I, I, I, I, I, I, I think he might have wanted to pull a trigger, but I don't know.

455
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He just did.

456
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He just did.

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

458
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And plus that weren't a lot of kids up here for him to.

459
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

460
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Recruited.

461
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And most of his kids were, were localed on the he go back and look.

462
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

463
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No.

464
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think at the time Washington probably had some.

465
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Washington had it.

466
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
African American.

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah.

468
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know, you saw, that's California clearly had long.

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah.

471
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You saw.

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You see, I don't had a fever.

473
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The rest of Oregon.

474
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They played them all the time.

475
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

476
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The sky was kind of holding the line.

477
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

478
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I was comparing them to rough.

479
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
When I was trying to understand what was going on.

480
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What was this guy trying to do?

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But that was the feeling pretty much.

482
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Amongst those.

483
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You don't have to leave in California.

484
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And they're hungry.

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He didn't really want to.

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I have to remember.

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But I was really.

488
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Right.

489
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And I guess nobody wanted to be the first with him.

490
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because there was not that good feeling about.

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You know.

493
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You get quite a fair.

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

495
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah.

496
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah.

497
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And so we're probably going to came down.

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He ever told you that.

499
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, I'm going to be the coach next.

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because I know I'm being lying.

501
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He was actually the coach when he came down.

502
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

503
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You know, when he got in the job.

504
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You already got in the job.

505
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, I see.

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Right.

507
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So yeah.

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I had read about it in the paper.

509
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But I didn't think much of it really.

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He called me.

511
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then he came to talk to me.

512
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Right.

513
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Okay.

514
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
So let's not carry the story on.

515
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Just talk about you now.

516
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Arriving on campus.

517
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
And what were some of your earliest recollections for you.

518
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Arriving on campus.

519
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
You're seeing the place.

520
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
What was that like?

521
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
One thing that was really funny.

522
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
There's a female named Charlie White.

523
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Name Charlie White.

524
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Yes.

525
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Okay.

526
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
All right.

527
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And they put her in one of the men's dorms.

528
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
The other men's dorms.

529
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
And I got to meet her later.

530
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I got out.

531
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I met her at a party.

532
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Really.

533
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay.

534
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Yes.

535
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
So.

536
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
But anyway.

537
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
When I first got here.

538
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
They had us doing jobs in Cottage Grove.

539
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay.

540
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Logging.

541
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Logging.

542
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Okay.

543
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
So in the office.

544
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Yeah.

545
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
But I came at the beginning of summer.

546
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
So went right into to work.

547
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Okay.

548
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Now Cottage Grove is down towards Eugene.

549
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I think it's East to Eugene out in the wilderness.

550
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay.

551
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
So they took me down there.

552
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
And I mean, this was not a good situation.

553
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
The first day I was there.

554
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Yeah.

555
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Took me in the evening.

556
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Yeah.

557
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
And I said, right?

558
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Me in the night.

559
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Yeah.

560
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
So the next morning I get up and I come down and everybody's staring.

561
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,500
And then the next day someone told me that it would be good if I didn't come out at night.

562
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Okay.

563
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
So I called Paul and said,

564
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm leaving.

565
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah.

566
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Yeah.

567
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Now.

568
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Yeah.

569
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
So they sent somebody and got me.

570
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
And I moved into Eugene.

571
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
There was some guys in Eugene that those fought for them.

572
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Three of four guys in the department.

573
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
And it was, it was makes a couple of like students and a couple of, and they were

574
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
after these.

575
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
And they brought me down there.

576
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,500
And every morning when we would do, we would catch a bus from Eugene to the cat

577
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
as drove and work and then we come back to Eugene.

578
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
So, you know.

579
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
So they took the job.

580
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Yeah.

581
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
But I didn't live in college.

582
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Grow.

583
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Yeah.

584
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Because I told them I wasn't staying.

585
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
They need to get me out of here now.

586
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Okay.

587
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
So I came to Eugene and then I worked at somewhere in the woods which was good.

588
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
We made a lot of money.

589
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I was going to pay in a whole lot.

590
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
But at that time, it was a lot of money.

591
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
And we did actually play suspended.

592
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
So all of a sudden, along we worked, stuck checking the bank so the school started

593
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
and a little money.

594
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Right.

595
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
That was common for us.

596
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah.

597
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Oh yeah.

598
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
We could work.

599
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Okay.

600
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Yeah.

601
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Monthly stipend.

602
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
So then started a season.

603
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
And I could say, we had a, you didn't have a very good team.

604
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
We were seven, seven in the back.

605
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
But actually, it wasn't that bad.

606
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Eight.

607
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Everybody says the packing.

608
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
It was the A-A-W-U.

609
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Which is the athletic association of Western universities.

610
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Okay.

611
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
But it was the original eight schools, the two in Oregon, a two in Washington, two in

612
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Southern California, two in Northern California.

613
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
It was the A-A-W-U.

614
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
The pack A-W-U.

615
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
The name pack A-W-U.

616
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
It came on later.

617
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
But anyway, we were seven, seven in confidence.

618
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I think it was 14, 10 overall or something like that.

619
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
You know, we, you know, we weren't really thinking of anything big.

620
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
The next year, we just wanted to be competitive.

621
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
And I had played a small forward in the first year here.

622
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
But then they put me in guard the next year.

623
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,500
And, you know, and all the guys, the only new guy that came in really was that really helped us

624
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
was Harry.

625
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
The only new guy.

626
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Harry Gunna.

627
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Okay.

628
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah.

629
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
He's the only new guy.

630
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
African-American who came in.

631
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, and a lot of Peter's.

632
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Yeah, I'll take that back.

633
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
A lot of them.

634
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Okay.

635
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,500
So they came in and, you know, we, we'd be people like a good, seven, eight in deep, you know.

636
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
What year was that when they came in?

637
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
We didn't find it.

638
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
It was 65.

639
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
But boy, it was not African-American.

640
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
We married Harry Gunna was.

641
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Yeah.

642
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Yeah.

643
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Okay.

644
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
We'll tell you that part of the research time.

645
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah.

646
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Yeah.

647
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Yeah.

648
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
So tell me about though that that reception that you received,

649
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
you feel that you received from the student body in that first year and then in the next year.

650
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
That you feel.

651
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Well.

652
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Like I said, you know, I'm oblivious to a lot and I've been a lot of places and, you know, and

653
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
there.

654
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah.

655
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
And so I mean, sure, you got some looks.

656
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Yeah.

657
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,500
And, you know, you know, you know, I just kept going, you know.

658
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I was here to do what I was here to do.

659
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:59,500
One incident was a one of the freshman players who, I knew, you know, not very well,

660
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
but you know, I knew who he was.

661
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
We were on campus and he was with his girlfriend.

662
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
And he stopped.

663
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,500
And he introduced me and she made a comment, oh, you're the one in my girlfriend's class.

664
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Yes.

665
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Okay.

666
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
And I said the one what?

667
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I don't know.

668
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah.

669
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
And she was totally embarrassed and couldn't even answer.

670
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
So I just said, I'll see you guys later.

671
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Right.

672
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
But, you know, I was going to find you.

673
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
You know.

674
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
You know.

675
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Yeah.

676
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,500
But like I said, most of the kids up here hadn't ever been around in any black people.

677
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
You've got a long go school with them or show them.

678
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Yeah.

679
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah.

680
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Because I had run into that.

681
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
And he owned me.

682
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I mean, I mean, he lived mostly celebrities.

683
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Yes.

684
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
He was seen.

685
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
They told me they'd seen back from a distance.

686
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
But, you know, they didn't know, you know.

687
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Wow.

688
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
And that was that.

689
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah.

690
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
They're from the South, living in a little small town.

691
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
It should be in place like that.

692
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Right.

693
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,500
But I didn't, I didn't feel anything in classes.

694
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Yeah.

695
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah.

696
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I don't feel anything.

697
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Teachers or students in the classes.

698
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Yeah.

699
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Whatever's an occasional, yeah.

700
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
A lot of somebody's car, you know.

701
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Okay.

702
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Yeah.

703
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Yeah.

704
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,500
And finding a combination in covalence and recreation in covalence.

705
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
What was that like?

706
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Well, the one.

707
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
The main thing is when I was almost into when I came down.

708
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
It was already active.

709
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
But I have to get America.

710
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
So I don't have a problem with that.

711
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
And how did you find that?

712
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Did the coach find that?

713
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
I think so.

714
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Okay.

715
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Yeah.

716
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I think so.

717
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
But they were football players.

718
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
And one was a man athlete.

719
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Okay.

720
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Well, they're laughing at Jesus.

721
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Pharmacist.

722
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Okay.

723
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Don't believe in a group.

724
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
We always turn it right.

725
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
He played tennis.

726
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And he loved five.

727
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Four or five.

728
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Five.

729
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
And he was a lower weight, you know.

730
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
But he's one of my best friends.

731
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
He's in Canada.

732
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
He didn't even get me in California now.

733
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
But yeah.

734
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
They were there.

735
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
And then we moved to another house.

736
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I think it was 17th near the Coliseum.

737
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Okay.

738
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
And we never had a problem.

739
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
We went over there.

740
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
And the 80.

741
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
You know.

742
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And the rent was 70 bucks a month.

743
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Wow.

744
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Then there was four.

745
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
It was sort of 1750 a month.

746
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
That's not bad.

747
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
That's not bad.

748
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
You know, plus the oil.

749
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
And then the oil.

750
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
The furnace in there.

751
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
But yeah.

752
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I was nice.

753
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I never had any problem.

754
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Finding a place.

755
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
He and those are only two places.

756
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
I lived in an apartment down in Canada.

757
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
I remember the street.

758
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Okay.

759
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
But that.

760
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Yeah.

761
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I never had any problems with that.

762
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Now in terms of, you mentioned going to parties.

763
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Because then where you said you'd met up.

764
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Chubby Brown.

765
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm sorry.

766
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Chubby White.

767
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
It's the female other party.

768
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Did you go to parties that were integrated?

769
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Or did you go to?

770
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And when you had a social life.

771
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
What was that?

772
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Well, all of.

773
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Well, all the time I was here.

774
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Not one white person I've been guided me to a party.

775
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
That I would go back and recall.

776
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Okay.

777
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Now I got invited to people's homes to have a dream.

778
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
So dinner.

779
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
You know, I was saying that.

780
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
But not ever once.

781
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Team mates or anyone.

782
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Never invited me to a party.

783
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
But we gave a party every weekend.

784
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Okay.

785
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
You're blessed.

786
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Yes.

787
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
A nice street.

788
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
A nice street.

789
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
A goal goal is what we called it.

790
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
That was a time to go go.

791
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah.

792
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
So all the.

793
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Obviously all of the women at our parties were.

794
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Wait.

795
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Okay.

796
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Well, with the exception of two to three.

797
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Because there were.

798
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Carol Smith.

799
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
And.

800
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
There was three of four.

801
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
African-American women kind of one.

802
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm lived here in Corvales.

803
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Okay.

804
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
There's a couple of ones from LA.

805
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
And another from.

806
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I forget.

807
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Second man over somewhere.

808
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Okay.

809
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
But.

810
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,500
But the majority of women were.

811
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
White women.

812
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Like women.

813
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
And also.

814
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Well, like Peterson, who's white.

815
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
He came to one of two of my parties early on.

816
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
And everybody knew him.

817
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
And nobody, you know, even have any.

818
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
You know, he's from Los Angeles.

819
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
So he's been around black.

820
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
I can't afford playing ball with the black.

821
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
So he named.

822
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm with that.

823
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
And this.

824
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Charlie White.

825
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
See.

826
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I guess he thought we were having a party.

827
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
She came to one of our parties.

828
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
And it should do this.

829
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I thought she was kid in the.

830
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
But.

831
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
You know, we talked a lot of time.

832
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I forgot.

833
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
She was from somewhere.

834
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
But.

835
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Okay.

836
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Yeah.

837
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
And that was pretty much.

838
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Our parties were.

839
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
And like, see, we gave parties.

840
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Every weekend.

841
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And we would even.

842
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Host.

843
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Is the.

844
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Other African.

845
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
And athletes.

846
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
When they came to talk.

847
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
When they came to talk.

848
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
If they were staying overnight.

849
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
You say, if you haven't a party.

850
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
We heard you guys come over.

851
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Yeah.

852
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
And they would.

853
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Yeah.

854
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah.

855
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I mean.

856
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
And then we.

857
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
You know, I got.

858
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
We became friendly with all the athletes.

859
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
And in our.

860
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
In the conference.

861
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Up and down the coast.

862
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Because when they came up here.

863
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah.

864
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
You know.

865
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
We went to Washington.

866
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Yeah.

867
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
You know, they host us.

868
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
You know, blah, blah, blah.

869
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
And then.

870
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
And I had a.

871
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
We had a friend who.

872
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
From Seattle who.

873
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
But school there.

874
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
So when we go up there.

875
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
You know, she would always have us.

876
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
You know, over to her place.

877
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
So.

878
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
And we go to Portland every now and then.

879
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
So.

880
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah.

881
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
What was the relationship like with the police when you guys had these parties?

882
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Was there any kind of?

883
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I don't know.

884
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
But I don't know.

885
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Police ever come into our house.

886
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Okay.

887
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah.

888
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I really don't.

889
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I.

890
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah.

891
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
I don't.

892
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Don't remember.

893
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
And what about fraternities?

894
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I mean, that's always been a sore.

895
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Point for a lot of students dealing with fraternities.

896
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
I think I got some.

897
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I got a few from a couple of fraternities who they were.

898
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
I don't recall.

899
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
But I.

900
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Wasn't anything I wanted to do.

901
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Yeah.

902
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
It don't any campus.

903
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Sure.

904
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
I've been in the military.

905
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I knew how living in barracks.

906
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
And all that stuff with guys.

907
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I didn't.

908
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I had my field of that.

909
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I didn't want to do anymore.

910
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
That.

911
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I was just sitting on.

912
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah.

913
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Yeah.

914
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I wasn't getting.

915
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
I thought it was more of the attention that it occurs.

916
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Because fraternity boys.

917
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Yeah.

918
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I always think to be down on.

919
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Yeah.

920
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah.

921
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah.

922
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Yeah.

923
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Yeah.

924
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
You know.

925
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
But then.

926
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
No.

927
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I think.

928
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
I think.

929
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Yeah.

930
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
It wasn't interesting.

931
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Okay.

932
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Keep not talked to us a little bit about your going through school.

933
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And so he said your process.

934
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
They went well.

935
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,500
What did you end up as a major in how did you sort of go on from there?

936
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Well, I.

937
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Major in business administration.

938
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
But the.

939
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Concentration in personnel and industrial relations.

940
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
I came here and I started here in September of the 64.

941
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:46,500
And I graduated in December of 67.

942
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
And.

943
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
So I left here in 68.

944
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
67.

945
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Okay.

946
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I got a job.

947
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
With the company called Crown seller back.

948
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Which was a large one of the largest paper manufacturing firms in the West Coast.

949
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Okay.

950
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And I got that through.

951
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
One of the alumni.

952
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
A guy who had played here with Paul.

953
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Okay.

954
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
And he worked for Crown seller back.

955
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Now.

956
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
At that time.

957
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Affirmative action was big.

958
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Really big.

959
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah.

960
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Any.

961
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Any black college graduate could.

962
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Could find a job.

963
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
You know, and you know.

964
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Whether you're qualified and not, and I said to say some.

965
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
But anyway, right.

966
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I got a job with Crown seller back.

967
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
And my specific job was to integrate the workforce.

968
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
At this company.

969
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Yeah.

970
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
And this was in any out California.

971
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Okay.

972
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Which was about as a racist as you could get.

973
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Okay.

974
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Any act is right next to Pittsburgh, California.

975
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Okay.

976
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Okay.

977
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Now those two places are.

978
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
All nine.

979
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Nine point nine.

980
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
I'm assuming we have African Americans in an area in the Pittsburgh.

981
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
And all the vice-living.

982
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
I can do that.

983
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Okay.

984
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Well, now went down there to look for a place to stay out.

985
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Back on the door.

986
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
People would open the door.

987
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
It's laughing at my face.

988
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Or some would open the door.

989
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Right.

990
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
So I went in the Pittsburgh.

991
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
And I found this apartment.

992
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I was over there.

993
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
It was just not very.

994
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Not very.

995
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Not very.

996
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Not a very nice place.

997
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,500
But anyway, I got hard to do that.

998
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
And then I did a pretty good job.

999
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,500
It was really interesting when I, you know, they wanted.

1000
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
African Americans.

1001
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
And they wanted more women.

1002
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Okay.

1003
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Now this is a manufacturing facility.

1004
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Yes.

1005
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Well, they had women working already.

1006
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Yeah.

1007
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
But of course, the women could only do certain jobs.

1008
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Yes.

1009
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Right.

1010
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,500
We're working in the, in the, in the factory was packing.

1011
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Okay.

1012
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
You know, they couldn't, you know, the, no, they couldn't work in shipping.

1013
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Got it.

1014
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
And they had one female left drug driver.

1015
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Maybe two.

1016
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
They couldn't operate the machines.

1017
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Which paid the most money.

1018
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Yeah.

1019
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
They couldn't do those jobs.

1020
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
So they were pretty much dead.

1021
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
You know, packing the boxes and that sort of thing.

1022
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Yeah.

1023
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
That's where it was at that time.

1024
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
It's also.

1025
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
So, you know, I would hire people.

1026
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
I would go out in the neighborhood.

1027
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I would go out in Pittsburgh where African Americans were.

1028
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Hispanics.

1029
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
They didn't have a lot of Spanish.

1030
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
We're going to either.

1031
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
So I'd go out.

1032
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
And I'd get 10 or 12 people to come in.

1033
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And at that time, they used to do all this.

1034
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Different testing.

1035
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
One to late.

1036
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
All that time.

1037
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Minnesota money.

1038
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Exactly.

1039
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
PM MPI.

1040
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
That took forever.

1041
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah.

1042
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
You know.

1043
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
You know.

1044
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
So anyway, we got ready at a some point.

1045
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
But I have 12 15 people in the room taking this test.

1046
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah.

1047
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You know, I'm helping them with it.

1048
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Because I'm trying to get people in there.

1049
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
And then I started doing that.

1050
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
And I'll tell you.

1051
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
The people who had that facility.

1052
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
They hated everything.

1053
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Yeah.

1054
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Now they were probably 10 or 12 black people working there.

1055
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
And they had been working there for quite some time.

1056
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I mean, it weren't for a new people.

1057
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Yeah.

1058
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,500
I don't think they'd have a black person probably in the last 10 years or so.

1059
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,500
But I started filling them up with African Americans, Hispanics, and female.

1060
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Yeah.

1061
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
And though they hated, they hated.

1062
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Do all this type of people that they hated.

1063
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I've been people out to the department.

1064
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Yeah.

1065
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
To the supervisor.

1066
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And the workers were just stared me.

1067
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Yeah.

1068
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
I got some bad meal in my inbox.

1069
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
You know, about affirmative action.

1070
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,500
And one guy was going to put a George Wallace on the sticker on my car.

1071
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
And somebody stopped him.

1072
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
You know what I mean?

1073
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
It was bad.

1074
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Yeah.

1075
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah.

1076
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
I want to come back though.

1077
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Because I forgot what for you.

1078
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
What are your stories?

1079
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
You actually got elected as, you know, you got a word here.

1080
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
No, it's called the Leadership Award.

1081
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
What you got.

1082
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
You know, I think it was 65, 66.

1083
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Yeah.

1084
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
How did that feel?

1085
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
That felt great.

1086
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Yeah.

1087
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Tell me about what happened.

1088
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
What happened?

1089
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Well, it probably made me the captain.

1090
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Okay.

1091
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
What was that like?

1092
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
I didn't, you know, I'd surprised to me.

1093
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Okay.

1094
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
And I didn't feel any angst from the team.

1095
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Mm-hmm.

1096
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I wasn't a yeller in a screamer anyway.

1097
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Mm-hmm.

1098
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Not like, well, I was just a pro with a yeller.

1099
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah.

1100
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
But I would tell guys, you know, and we would have dialogue.

1101
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I wouldn't, you know.

1102
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
You would give me this day.

1103
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
You did that.

1104
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
You know, we would, I'm going to do this.

1105
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Why don't you do that?

1106
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
And when they come down here, let's make sure that we do this.

1107
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Sure.

1108
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
You know, that was it.

1109
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Yeah.

1110
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
That was it.

1111
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
You know, it wasn't like this.

1112
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Yeah.

1113
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
It was just like that.

1114
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
We need to stop these guys.

1115
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
And this is what we need to do.

1116
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Sure.

1117
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
We're going to follow you, always.

1118
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Say, excuse me, in a huddle.

1119
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
He'd say, this, this and this.

1120
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
And then, as we broke the huddle, he would always say,

1121
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
what you got to play the situation.

1122
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Because it may not come that way.

1123
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
So you got to be a winning for it.

1124
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
And that's what I say too.

1125
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Yeah.

1126
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
They may not go that way.

1127
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
They may come this way.

1128
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
They've become this way.

1129
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
We'll do this.

1130
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
You know.

1131
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
So yeah, and I feel good about that.

1132
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah, I really did.

1133
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Yeah.

1134
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,500
And he, he felt good about it too.

1135
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Paul and I had a real special relationship.

1136
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Yeah.

1137
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
That's making the captain.

1138
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
But more interesting.

1139
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
You've reflected on the student leadership award.

1140
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Yeah.

1141
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Was there a leadership?

1142
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I think it was just with the team.

1143
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Yeah.

1144
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
I think that was one of the things.

1145
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
OK.

1146
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
OK.

1147
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Sure.

1148
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Let's come back then to your, at the company in Anya.

1149
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Thank you, Tom.

1150
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
So, was that your job you continued on with?

1151
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Or you said that you were.

1152
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Well, I did that for a while.

1153
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,500
And then, I wanted to learn some more about the business.

1154
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,500
So I took a production job.

1155
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
OK.

1156
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
And, well, let me go back.

1157
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah.

1158
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Yeah.

1159
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:10,500
When I was bringing these people into, uh, to go to work, they had what they called

1160
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
The Probation Appearance.

1161
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
For the new employees.

1162
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Which were only 30 days.

1163
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Which is not a lot of time.

1164
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
No.

1165
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
No.

1166
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:25,500
But they were terminating these people as fast as the most as fast as I could after two, two, three weeks.

1167
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Yeah.

1168
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Almost 30 days.

1169
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
But they just say, where they can't do the job.

1170
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Yeah.

1171
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Right.

1172
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Now, I said, what do we do?

1173
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Something's wrong.

1174
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
So, Hispanic, gentlemen.

1175
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
And Leo, mehattis.

1176
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I don't remember.

1177
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
He and I used to talk.

1178
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
He came to me and said, you know, they don't, they're not giving these guys a chance.

1179
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Yeah.

1180
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
They're not training them right.

1181
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
So, after 30 days, these people can't do the job.

1182
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
They're kicking them out.

1183
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Right.

1184
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Right.

1185
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
So, we got to do something.

1186
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I said, well, he was a union, uh, stewed also.

1187
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
So, I said, let's take what we're going to do.

1188
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:03,500
We said, I only made up a form that had to be filled out every week.

1189
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
But we supervised, we had to supervise it.

1190
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Right.

1191
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
What was taught to this just, you know, right.

1192
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,500
And this person, male female, whatever, had to agree.

1193
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
So, at the end of the week, we were set out on with the union steward.

1194
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Yeah.

1195
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Myself.

1196
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Right.

1197
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
And the partner supervise.

1198
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
And not the guy who trained him with department supervisor.

1199
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
He was going to go over that.

1200
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
And they got said, nobody told me this.

1201
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Nobody told me that.

1202
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Didn't we could extend this probation if he had it.

1203
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
And then we made sure that they got to correct training.

1204
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Right.

1205
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Because we did that on a weekly basis.

1206
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Took all the time.

1207
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
But, you know, we did it.

1208
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Right.

1209
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
And we kept started me and able to retain, uh, people.

1210
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Because, you know, hiring people.

1211
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Because my name's a lot of work.

1212
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
And you send them for physicals.

1213
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
You spend money and then they kick them out.

1214
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Right.

1215
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
So, right.

1216
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
So, we did that.

1217
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
But then I wanted to, uh, expand.

1218
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
So, I went out in production.

1219
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Worked production.

1220
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
For a while.

1221
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
Shiftwork, press production pay a little bit of money.

1222
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,500
And then I was learning a little more about the business.

1223
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:06,500
And then, um, the safety manager left.

1224
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
And I decided, you know, I had enough of shift work.

1225
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
And I decided to go back in the personnel office.

1226
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Since I've got my base scale up.

1227
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,500
And I went back in as the safety manager.

1228
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Now, I worked there for eight years.

1229
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Okay.

1230
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,500
And, um, you know, doing all this time.

1231
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:29,500
And, uh, I didn't have an opportunity to go with a large construction firm called Long Star Industries,

1232
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:39,500
which was, uh, covered, uh, five states, uh, California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Hawaii.

1233
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Oh, no.

1234
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Okay.

1235
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
So, we still have to get up.

1236
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Yeah.

1237
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
And I was regional safety manager, which was a big job.

1238
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
You know, you get your car and stuff.

1239
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
You get to travel a lot.

1240
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
So, I took that job.

1241
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Yeah.

1242
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Did you have a family at that point?

1243
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Or you were still?

1244
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah, I had one son.

1245
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Yeah.

1246
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I had a son in 1987.

1247
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Okay.

1248
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Sure.

1249
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Um, did you ever have any aspirations being a coach?

1250
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Because, I mean, after you leave basketball.

1251
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I mean, a lot of guys kind of me have that aspirations.

1252
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Hey, you know what?

1253
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I can probably do some of this stuff.

1254
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Well, you know, I, I did, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I've got a close

1255
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
freshman here a little bit.

1256
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Okay.

1257
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
You know, and I, right after I stopped playing.

1258
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Okay.

1259
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,500
And I, I guess the reason I didn't stay in coaching.

1260
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I wanted to get back to California.

1261
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Really.

1262
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,500
And so I thought the quickest way for me to get back was to this pursue my degree.

1263
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
But otherwise, I, I thought about it after.

1264
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
It's not right after.

1265
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Maybe 10 years after.

1266
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
But I was very disappointed when Paul quit.

1267
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
97.

1268
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Yeah.

1269
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
97.

1270
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
He only had to head coaching down for six, seven years.

1271
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
He just gave it up.

1272
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
I don't know.

1273
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Did you ever talk to him about why that was?

1274
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Because we didn't.

1275
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Well, yeah.

1276
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I don't know that he'd blown up.

1277
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Okay.

1278
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Well, that's okay.

1279
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
All right.

1280
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
You know, um, now in terms of your connection back to Detroit,

1281
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
it sounds like that got severed a long time ago.

1282
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
You know, that you never really would have aspiration to go back there.

1283
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
No, not to live, no.

1284
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
You kept calling me back there.

1285
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh, yeah.

1286
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
It was like, yeah.

1287
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,500
But what happened is, uh, six, five or six of my nieces and nephews came to California.

1288
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Oh.

1289
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
But only one state.

1290
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Okay.

1291
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
They all came.

1292
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
One went to Los Angeles.

1293
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
They stayed up wild.

1294
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
I don't know.

1295
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
They have a one state.

1296
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
He's still in California.

1297
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
But they all got someone back to Detroit.

1298
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
But, you know, yeah.

1299
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
My family other than my nephew.

1300
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Here's the, they're all in Detroit.

1301
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Okay.

1302
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
And so you make regular.

1303
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Yeah.

1304
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
I do.

1305
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
I went back last year, twice.

1306
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
So this year, just recently when I was in Las Vegas, my nephew graduated.

1307
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
So a bunch of them came out.

1308
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
So we had a nice little family.

1309
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Yeah.

1310
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
And that's the weekend.

1311
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
So I'm going back and I'll get stuff.

1312
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
One of my nieces is really married.

1313
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
So I'm going to go back for that.

1314
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
But I'm going to be out of here before winter.

1315
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I do your thing.

1316
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Yeah.

1317
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I went back last September and stayed two weeks.

1318
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Yeah.

1319
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Okay.

1320
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Right.

1321
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Carry on the story a little bit further than you finished working eight years.

1322
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Or so he said, uh, as in any of the things that you want to do.

1323
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
It's a supervisor position where you work.

1324
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Yeah.

1325
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
First now.

1326
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Regional.

1327
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
It's what else did you do outside?

1328
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Well, I worked that for a while and then that company got bought up and they

1329
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
downsized and everything.

1330
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
So I went to work for a shopping mall.

1331
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
I was the safety director in a large shopping mall.

1332
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I've been near San Francisco.

1333
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,500
And I worked there for quite a few years.

1334
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
And then I got into contract security.

1335
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Okay.

1336
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
We're going to contract security for him in Oakland.

1337
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I was at that.

1338
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I mean the branch manager there for.

1339
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,500
I need to for 12 years.

1340
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Okay.

1341
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,500
And then just before I was thinking about retiring, I went to work for Bayer.

1342
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Yes.

1343
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,500
And I worked for them in Berkeley for two years.

1344
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
And then I finally retired.

1345
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Two thousand four.

1346
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Okay.

1347
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
But then I got bored.

1348
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Okay.

1349
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
So two thousand six rows around.

1350
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I met home and I look across the street and I see these kids playing basketball over there.

1351
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
It was a school for.

1352
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Minuity challenge youth.

1353
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
So I went over there.

1354
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Yeah.

1355
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
I'm playing basketball.

1356
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I see what they were doing.

1357
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
The people were there with nice.

1358
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
They talked me in the driving the school bus.

1359
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Okay.

1360
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Yeah.

1361
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Because he's got a pretty hard.

1362
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
They have a lot of female drivers in these guys.

1363
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
They were tough on the limits.

1364
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
So I do it after three and a half years.

1365
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
And I enjoy it.

1366
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
It's so nice.

1367
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
And then I try not to escape.

1368
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah.

1369
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Yeah.

1370
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
No.

1371
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Coming back to playing volleyball or not just playing ball.

1372
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
But after you left the audience,

1373
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,500
they did your ever sort of just play or keep working out.

1374
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Or any of those kind of things with ball.

1375
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Yeah.

1376
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Yeah.

1377
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
I played it.

1378
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
And then I'm not there.

1379
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
You but I played for different teams all over the Northern California.

1380
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Yeah.

1381
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,500
We had a quite a quite a network of teams.

1382
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Sacramento.

1383
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
You just have to march a dime.

1384
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Lake Tahoe had a tournament.

1385
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,500
That a tournament down below Monterey.

1386
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
And a little small town called Gonzalez, which was a bird.

1387
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
But it was a real popular tournament.

1388
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
It's a college place.

1389
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
You see them all the time.

1390
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
They go down there.

1391
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
But you know, somebody would call me in the middle of the week and say,

1392
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
we've got a game up in the Sacramento.

1393
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
And I've jumping my car off the work.

1394
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
And we're just a second middle.

1395
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I don't have a way.

1396
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
And I'd go play.

1397
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Yeah.

1398
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I played a whole lot.

1399
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah.

1400
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
I don't remember when I stopped playing organized, but I played a lot.

1401
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Yeah.

1402
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Yeah.

1403
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
What's the card not to play?

1404
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Yeah.

1405
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Yeah.

1406
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Yeah.

1407
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Yeah.

1408
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Yeah.

1409
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Yeah.

1410
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I went out of, you know, France for one of the first things I did.

1411
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
It was fine.

1412
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I'm wearing a gas plate ball in the afternoon and I went over there and I went to work

1413
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
down and there.

1414
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
He even got out of college.

1415
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
He put in the company team down.

1416
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Down in Cardine.

1417
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,500
And he had those large companies around the duppin doll.

1418
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,500
They're a USDA.

1419
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
You know, stuff like that.

1420
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
They all had teams.

1421
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
And we, they've had a good league.

1422
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
And we played the middle league.

1423
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
And it was good.

1424
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,500
We had a lot of fun doing that.

1425
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:28,140
And now that you're in Annie, I can, those teams were mostly integrated.

1426
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:35,180
And we never had any incidences that play involved, but you know, trying to do something

1427
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,420
in town initially, they took a lot before they loosened up, and I got to meet several

1428
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:49,500
policemen down there, and I used to hang out at the cop bar, so like everything was cool,

1429
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
because someone had hired some of the policemen's kids.

1430
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, and to the, okay, that's where we're working for the summers, you know, every year.

1431
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,200
Oh, yeah, that was a good job.

1432
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,700
No, yeah, they worked in, and so, you know, it was, it was pretty good.

1433
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,300
Right.

1434
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,700
Now, looking back on leavey organizations, did you ever, any aspirations are going on to play preferable?

1435
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:18,500
Well, I did, I wanted to play, but I didn't get drafted, and I didn't want to go take a chance

1436
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,500
and not make it, and then I'm not having to finish school yet.

1437
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Okay.

1438
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Now, they had the teams that they have now, all over the world, and Europe, and where else

1439
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
you want to go to team, they have teams everywhere.

1440
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Yeah, sure, sure.

1441
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I probably could have gotten a drop of jobs away, because my nephew went down and played

1442
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,500
in Argentina for 13 years, so yeah.

1443
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,500
So, I could have, but that wasn't available to us at the time I came out, and I probably

1444
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
would have jumped at that.

1445
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Right.

1446
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,000
If I knew that I could go, you know, play for a couple of years in Europe, or someplace

1447
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,500
in make a little money, and you know, because I could come back and finish.

1448
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you really put school to part of, which is a great thing.

1449
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Yeah.

1450
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Yep.

1451
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,500
You thought, is there any other questions you want to ask?

1452
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,500
At this point, because I think we're sort of at the end of what I had to ask.

1453
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,500
They didn't even think of me, our cut perspective, they didn't want to ask.

1454
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Well, you mentioned Harry Gunner, so when he came on the team, it was the 65, 66 season,

1455
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,500
and he was, did that change the dynamic at all?

1456
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Was that nice to have another?

1457
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Oh yeah, it was nice to have a plus.

1458
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
He helped us a lot.

1459
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
He needed his, you know, size and strength, you know.

1460
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
He didn't start, but he played a lot.

1461
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Yeah.

1462
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Yeah.

1463
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
He, he was our sixth man, and he was in first guy out to bed, usually.

1464
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
And, yeah, it's done.

1465
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Right.

1466
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,500
And now it's really funny.

1467
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Harry and I didn't always room together.

1468
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
So, you know, because sometimes I'm annoying.

1469
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I used to room together most of the time.

1470
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,500
But you could always find the three of us in one of our bedrooms,

1471
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
the Harry's, you know, because we weren't being close.

1472
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Yeah, Roy used to hang with us.

1473
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Right.

1474
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Because Roy didn't, Roy hated this place.

1475
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
He, oh, he hated every bit of life.

1476
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Right.

1477
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Coming from Los Angeles.

1478
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,500
And he, he was one of those players that played, he was a playground player.

1479
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Sure.

1480
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Because he'd been playing with back kids all this time.

1481
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Right.

1482
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,500
And he was a playground player.

1483
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,500
He had more moves.

1484
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm tempted to count the words.

1485
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
I'd say.

1486
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
And he could play.

1487
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Right.

1488
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
But he and Paul, man.

1489
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,500
They just didn't.

1490
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,500
He never got together for his three years here.

1491
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Wow.

1492
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,500
Interesting.

1493
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,500
And now he went on a play professional.

1494
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Oh, he did.

1495
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
They created Chicago.

1496
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
They've over several years.

1497
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Yeah.

1498
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,500
And he found it.

1499
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Now, he married a girl from Madras, Oregon.

1500
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, I didn't know.

1501
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Okay.

1502
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
But he, he hated Oregon.

1503
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
He, everybody came up here now.

1504
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
And he, he had Paul just never.

1505
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Yeah.

1506
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
They never got along.

1507
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Never.

1508
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Yeah.

1509
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Yeah.

1510
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I mean, they were a clarity to them.

1511
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
In practice and on the bench.

1512
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Yeah.

1513
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Yeah.

1514
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
And it was a hell of a player.

1515
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Right.

1516
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Yeah.

1517
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Right.

1518
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Now, in the movie glory road, there was actually, eventually, some tension

1519
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
that occurred between the players.

1520
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Just about black and white, as you know, black players get in.

1521
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
They saw the black players taking their shots.

1522
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Sure.

1523
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
Like that.

1524
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
No.

1525
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
No.

1526
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
We just so few of you, anyway.

1527
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah.

1528
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Well, first of just, please.

1529
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Yeah.

1530
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Yeah.

1531
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
No, I never did.

1532
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I never got any feeling.

1533
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
I've never felt that anywhere.

1534
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
And I, and I, and I know I didn't definitely ever say that to me.

1535
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Right.

1536
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah.

1537
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Yeah.

1538
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Have you also?

1539
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Well, I want to thank you very, very much.

1540
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Okay.

1541
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Great interview.

1542
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
And it's been exactly almost 45 minutes.

1543
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Great stuff.

1544
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
So we really appreciate it.

1545
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Okay.

1546
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
I got to pick up parties.

1547
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
I know he's probably championing it to be.

1548
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Okay.

1549
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Well, I'm pretty sorry about that.

1550
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Yeah.

1551
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Yeah.

1552
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Okay.

1553
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah.

1554
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
But thanks.

1555
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Are you going to be simple?

1556
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah.

1557
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Can I give you his plaque?

1558
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Sure.

1559
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
You're going to go.
