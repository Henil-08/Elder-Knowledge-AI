00:02
Today is January 5, 2018.
00:05
I’m here with Dr. Bev Law of the Forest, Ecosystems, and Society
00:10
Department at Oregon State University.
00:12
We’re at the Valley Library.
00:14
Today we’re going to talk about her research, particularly as it pertains
00:18
to climate change, but I’m going to start out with your background.
00:22
Where were you born?
00:24
I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota and grew up on the lake there
00:31
and I lived outdoors pretty much.
00:34
All they had to do was ring a bell to get us to come in and eat and that was it.
00:38
What did your parents do?
00:40
My father was a manager and traveled a lot, and my mother had artistic talent
00:47
and taught art in her early years.
00:51
In addition, I think the major influence on me was my grandfather.
00:55
We come from a family of centenarians, so I have learned firsthand stories
01:02
about what it was like to live in Minnesota in the 1800s from my great
01:06
grandmother who also lived to 109.
01:08
But he was a friend of Segrid Olson and he taught me.
01:12
He took me in the woods and explained how elements moved through
01:16
forests and how trees dying wasn’t such a bad thing because that
01:20
provides food for the next forest.
01:23
So, you had an early interest in forestry as a child?
01:26
Did you foresee yourself going into forestry as an adult?
01:29
I saw myself as being someone who stayed outdoors all the time.
01:33
I loved birds.
01:35
I still do and just walking through forests and hearing the sounds, seeing
01:42
animals, and I’ve done some long, month-long trips into Yellowstone and
01:48
Rocky Mountain National Park where I winter camped and cross-country skied
01:52
and got to see bison in the winter.
01:55
There have been some great experiences in my life, outdoor experiences.
02:00
What
02:03
influenced your decision to attend college?
02:07
I knew I was a restless person and my parents knew early that, okay,
02:12
this person’s going to be work because I asked too many questions
02:16
and so I wanted to go further.
02:18
I always wanted to go further and I found ways to do it.
02:21
I had a 10-year hiatus where I worked as a researcher and I thought what the heck?
02:27
Why not go get the masters and Ph.D., so I went straight through to Ph.D.
02:33
You did your bachelors at the University of Florida.
02:36
Yeah, the University of Florida and it was in forest resources and conservation.
02:41
I learned about ecological modeling back in the ‘70s as well as how
02:48
forests are managed intensively down in the southeast U.S.
02:53
Did you participate in undergraduate research?
02:56
Yeah, I did.
02:57
Well, I did a lot of things on the side, but I had to.
03:00
I had to put myself through school, so I worked in research on soils
03:05
and on physiology of small trees and how they were impacted by
03:09
drought and hot soil temperatures.
03:14
Where did you end up going after you graduated?
03:18
You mentioned a 10-year hiatus.
03:19
Yeah, so I worked for AT&T for a while and so I worked with a lot
03:25
of corporations and I learned how corporations operate, how some are really
03:29
fantastic and how to talk to people in corporations at different levels.
03:35
From there I worked at the University of Florida in research
03:38
and helped masters students.
03:40
Then I came to Oregon and worked at the EPA on acid rain and on
03:45
developing the forest health monitoring program for the U.S. Forest Service.
03:48
So that is actually something that came to fruition the forest services implemented.
03:53
What was it like working for the EPA at that time?
03:57
It was great.
03:58
The EPA had such a great cadre of high-quality people working on acid
04:05
rain, really had their hearts in it.
04:08
I learned then how to write for staffers because this is
04:12
Washington, D.C., staffers.
04:15
The would send requests for information that only gave you maybe
04:18
6 hours to 24 hours to respond to.
04:22
We called them fire drills and we had to gather information very
04:25
quickly and write it in a way that staffers would understand it.
04:31
What influenced your decision to return to school and pursue a Ph.D.?
04:36
At EPA that was right when we had just launched the forest
04:40
health monitoring program.
04:41
There was a lot of development time that went into it, spent a lot of
04:44
time in Washington, D.C. But at the time that we got it launched I
04:48
thought, okay now I’ve got to go on.
04:50
I’ve got to keep moving and Dick Waring at OSU, I used to edit for him.
04:57
He’d always bring his manuscripts over to me at EPA, found
04:59
somebody who would edit for free.
05:03
It turns out I had met him when he came down to speak at the University
05:05
of Florida and he kept pushing me to go back, too, under him and so a project
05:09
came up, a NASA project, and I worked on that on my Ph.D. It was a transect.
05:14
I still work along this transect from the coast to the desert.
05:20
You were in the forest science program, right?
05:23
Mm-hmm [yes]
05:23
. What was the culture of the program like at that time?
05:27
There were a lot of high-quality ecologists that were
05:31
well-known internationally.
05:32
It must have been 10 or more, 10-15, 20, well-known ecologists.
05:37
Their literature is known everywhere, and so it was a
05:40
wonderful environment to learn in.
05:43
I picked the hardest people for my committee and across a broad
05:46
range of fields so that I could learn a lot more from them aside
05:50
from classes and that was worth it.
05:54
It has changed since then.
05:56
They’re not that many of us left.
05:59
Did you teach as a graduate student?
06:04
Yes, actually I did.
06:05
It was forest ecosystems and it was on the carbon water and
06:10
nitrogen cycling in forests.
06:13
Dick Waring, who was my major professor, went to NASA headquarters for 2 years
06:18
of my 3-year Ph.D. so I ended up teaching his classes while he was gone.
06:23
That was also a good experience and I had to come up with a lot
06:27
of my own materials for that.
06:30
I didn’t do I entirely alone.
06:32
It was always a co-taught class, so I learned from a great person
06:37
then, too, and same with my postdoc.
06:41
I taught forest atmosphere interaction class micrometeorology.
06:46
And your postdoc was at OSU?
06:49
At OSU, yeah.
06:49
Why did you decide to stay in academia?
06:52
Because
06:54
I think I’ve always been an entrepreneur.
06:56
I’ve always been somebody who wanted to run things and lead things.
07:01
I looked at my statement from undergrad and I’d said I want to be in a
07:05
think tank or leading a big research program or research institute, and
07:11
I’ve pretty much followed that path.
07:14
So, it sounds like you’ve always been interested in a policy
07:17
component to your research?
07:20
Yeah.
07:20
I’ve always thought you can do basic science but also build on that to
07:24
make it policy-relevant, because after all it’s tax payers’ money.
07:27
I think we owe it to the country to do some good with that and translate it.
07:34
You’ve also been affiliated with the College of Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences?
07:38
Mm-hmm [yes]
07:39
. It sounds like there’s overlap between those two departments in your research?
07:43
Yeah.
07:44
So, on that, there was a project that I did in my postdoc,
07:49
another NASA-funded project.
07:52
When Dick Waring was gone I took the lead on that project for the
07:58
ecosystem portion of, but I had to learn the atmosphere portion.
08:01
So Mike Unsworth, who is an atmospheric scientists here and recently retired,
08:06
was my advisor and while I was working on that project I learned
08:11
so much about the atmosphere, vegetation atmosphere interaction.
08:15
I already had a graduate course on this, but I ended up co-teaching
08:20
that course and then doing that for my research, so I crossed fields.
08:25
I’ve always crossed fields with remote sensing, modeling, observations.
08:29
So, satellite observations, field observations.
08:33
I’ve always combined all of those elements to do the best to understand
08:36
what’s happening in forests.
08:40
And you’re the director of Terra Pacific Northwest Group?
08:45
Yeah, the Terra PNW.
08:48
A group of us that all of these people retired now we had a very large EPA star
08:56
project that had a huge field component and that doesn’t happen anymore and so I
09:02
was the PI, the principle investigator on it, as I have been on most of my projects
09:09
and that was following on looking at the carbon that goes into forests and water
09:17
that cycles between the forest and the atmosphere and it had those components
09:22
I just mentioned of remote sensing and satellite data on forests and using
09:29
that information to train models and then map what’s happening to forests
09:34
and that one was over all of Oregon.
09:37
We just published those data.
09:39
It was 20 years of my data collection that we published.
09:42
We’re so proud that finally got somebody to do this and help me with it.
09:47
So, 20 years of data from hundreds of plots in Oregon and California, and
09:52
those data are used to parametrize or feed into a model to tell you
09:56
how a different species reacts to different climate variables.
10:01
Can you talk about how the technology has changed over your career in
10:05
terms of capturing that data?
10:08
I think the micrometeorology has been the biggest one.
10:11
We were on the forefront of that.
10:14
When I started working in that at Harvard Forest a group of us, a small group,
10:18
got together who were funded to do this.
10:20
Following my postdoc my first grant I was the PI on it and we decided
10:27
we needed to organize and so we said we needed to try, it’s better than
10:33
having individual sites but be able to compare results across sites.
10:38
These are towers that go above the forest and they have these measurements
10:42
of eddies in the air and carbon dioxide and water concentrations.
10:46
From that we understand what’s cycling between forests in the atmosphere.
10:55
That was really important because now a lot of those sites, we have about
10:59
20 years of data and we’re seeing the climate effects on these forests.
11:04
We’re seeing it in our observations.
11:08
So, there are about 20 in the U.S. and 20 in Europe that often get into these
11:12
synthesis papers where everybody’s looking at it in a different way to
11:17
look at what is happening in forests and how they’re responding and different
11:21
parts of forests are responding.
11:24
But it’s not just forests.
11:25
We do forests, grasslands, shrublands, agricultural crops, and had a recent
11:31
project where we’re still wrapping it up but it is on the Oregon urban, suburban,
11:36
agriculture, forest regredient of how carbon is going into the atmosphere.
11:42
Are forests taking it up?
11:44
What are crops doing?
11:45
In addition to all of these towers that we’ve had in Oregon for that rapid
11:50
response that accumulate over a year’s timeframe and multiple years we also have
11:57
high precision carbon dioxide measurements at the tops of really tall towers, 280
12:03
meter tall towers, mountaintops, and these are used in global analysis of atmospheric
12:10
carbon dioxide and the contributions to it when we separate what’s fossil fuel,
12:16
what’s vegetation, what’s ocean uptake?
12:20
Is that a part of the AmeriFlux network?
12:23
That’s part of the NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations,
12:28
program, but it’s also part of the global observation program, the World
12:32
Meteorological Organization and we’re helping them develop this for other
12:36
countries as Europe and the U.S. do it.
12:39
But the other one, AmeriFlux, that’s the one that we started in the cold
12:45
winter at Harvard forest, where we said we need to organize and I was
12:50
saying where we need central questions, science questions that we’re all going
12:54
after and consistency of measurements and comparability across sites.
12:59
I opened my mouth too much, and I became the leader of the program.
13:02
We grew from about at that time 10-20 sites to over 100 in North America and
13:10
South America and it continues today.
13:13
I ran that for about 11 years, so running it meant keeping the scientists
13:19
engaged, herding cats, working together.
13:24
But also, it meant keeping the world of scientists together and trying to
13:31
make this something that could last for many, many years and it would be our
13:37
best observation of what is happening in ecosystems with climate change.
13:42
I did that for about 11 years but I’m still on the science
13:45
steering committee now.
13:46
It’s run out of a Lawrence Berkeley Lab, but they just maintain it.
13:50
I did all the hard part of database development with Microsoft’s
13:53
assistance as well as the strategic plan that’s still live.
13:58
It’s still relevant today, and all the things that it takes to organize science.
14:08
That’s been a great experience, too.
14:11
How do you, I don’t know if there’s an easy explanation of this, but how do
14:17
you differentiate between carbon sources when you’re gathering that kind of data?
14:21
Say from humans versus—?
14:23
Yeah, this is where it gets complicated.
14:26
But there are ways.
14:29
For instance, on our very tall towers we measure carbon dioxide and carbon
14:34
monoxide and carbon monoxide sources can be automobiles or wildfire and
14:40
so we’re able to separate that out.
14:43
We’ve used some of the observations from our AmeriFlux towers to
14:48
train this earth system model.
14:51
Once we train the earth system model, we predicted that carbon uptake by all
14:56
the vegetation over the whole surface.
14:59
We did kind of a small scale demonstration of what can be done
15:02
globally and to get an idea of how many systems of measurements do you need to
15:07
resolve this and reduce uncertainty.
15:11
So, we used those flux towers to train the models and then when we have
15:17
this spatial estimate of where the sources and sinks are, that’s kind of
15:22
prior thing we have the atmospheric carbon dioxide and we say this is
15:26
what we think is the vegetation part.
15:28
We combine that information to see where is the model having problems or
15:34
where does it do well and by integrating those we really reduced uncertainty
15:38
in those estimates over a region.
15:42
We did this over Oregon and it’s being used as a demonstration
15:47
to show what others can do.
15:51
Has anthropogenic climate change always been a part of your
15:55
research with carbon exchange?
15:57
[Nods]
15:57
. When did that enter the picture?
16:00
It’s kind of funny because I think back to what happened in the ‘70s when I was
16:05
a student and I was doing physiology work and I was building a chamber.
16:11
This company made a chamber for measuring this gas exchange at a small
16:16
scale, in this cubette they called it.
16:18
This little box.
16:19
It was made from big leaf plants and it didn’t work on converse so I was
16:24
redesigning it for my advisor and I was trying different sizes and fan
16:31
speeds and other things like that.
16:33
When I open it up for ambient, so the atmospheric carbon dioxide, that ambient
16:39
measurement, I’m watching the readings.
16:41
It kept going up.
16:43
I’m going what is this pattern?
16:45
I realized there was a stoplight not far away and it was C02 coming from the cars.
16:51
Then I went oh my gosh it’s going over 400 every time the
16:54
stoplight stops all these cars.
16:56
I thought how do we deal with this when you have these sources all around where
17:01
you’re trying to get clean observations of the general response of plants?
17:06
That was early on, but all the way through I kept paying attention to C02, so I know
17:10
what it was then and it was about 365 parts per million, something like that.
17:16
Now it’s over 410, globally.
17:19
That’s the global average.
17:20
So,
17:24
once I was seeing it at that very small scale I started learning more
17:28
about how it is a global problem and then I wanted to learn more about
17:35
that and bring that into my research.
17:36
Well, how are the plants going to respond if it’s like that all the time?
17:43
Can you talk about how modeling technology or language has
17:47
changed through your career?
17:48
What you’re using in the early part versus now?
17:51
The early part, we were developing really simple models.
17:55
Through my Ph.D. it was a light use efficiency model.
18:00
It starts with how much light is coming in and so what is the
18:03
maximum potential photosynthesis that could occur with that light.
18:07
Then you bring in other climatic factors.
18:10
If it’s dryer, those pores that take up carbon dioxide close
18:14
down and they can take up less.
18:16
Seeing if it’s hotter,
18:20
they can’t use the carbon that they’ve taken up.
18:22
They lose some
18:25
of it.
18:26
So, there’s some of that that goes into what we were doing that simple modeling
18:32
and even during my Ph.D. we started working with a model that’s kind of
18:38
brought in a hydrology model into it.
18:40
It was based on these measurements that I’ve got to say that I
18:44
always hoped they would go away.
18:45
I did these in my undergrad and we’re still doing it today,
18:48
and it’s called predawn water potential with emphasis on predawn.
18:53
I’ve been out there many mornings starting at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning.
18:58
Now I’m not doing it.
18:59
It’s my students and it’s like a right of passage.
19:01
You’ve got to do this, we did it!
19:06
But it was a measurement that told us how much drought stress
19:10
were these trees going through.
19:13
We used that in the models, so it was a stomatal conductance model.
19:19
Then there are the famous guys who developed a good stomatal conductance
19:22
model and a good photosynthesis model and then it grew and grew.
19:26
Now we’re working with earth system models that have maybe, I don’t know, a thousand
19:31
or more lines of code, maybe 10,000.
19:35
So many lines of code.
19:36
It’s the earth.
19:37
It has an ocean component, atmosphere, land component, water
19:42
flow, lateral flow if you want to have that component in model.
19:46
It’s called a community land model.
19:48
It was developed out of national NCAR in Colorado, and National Atmospheric
19:56
Research—Climate Atmospheric Research, something like that.
20:00
Anyway, this model is a bear and we describe it as a big ball of string like
20:07
that giant one that’s in the Midwest.
20:09
We’re just pulling strings.
20:11
Fixing it.
20:11
Fixing different parts of the model.
20:13
When you fix it here, something else goes wrong and so you’re constantly—we
20:18
just spent five years developing improving the fire model and improving
20:23
drought sensitivity in the model.
20:25
Our improvements as well as the projecting beetle response to climate,
20:31
as we put a beetle model into it.
20:33
It hadn’t been in there before.
20:35
The fire model was meant for a global model.
20:37
It wasn’t for regional applications.
20:39
As NCAR has said to us, we’ve pushed the model as far as anybody or farther
20:44
than anybody has gone with it to try to bring it down to regional scale analysis.
20:50
Not only the inputs but how the model functions, such as
20:53
lightning strikes and so forth.
20:56
We
20:59
meet often with this group to say here’s where we are in these model developments.
21:04
After we’ve done the testing they decide shall we bring it in to main stem of the
21:08
model or one of the branches and that’s why it’s called the community model.
21:12
We all work together.
21:14
Nobody could possibly work on all of the parts all the time themselves.
21:19
So, we’ve been working with this model now since about 2006 or
21:24
’08, somewhere around there.
21:27
It’s advanced to the point that it’s applicable regionally.
21:32
Now we’re doing these projections of what will happen to forests and
21:36
shrublands and other ecosystems under future climate conditions.
21:43
What will mortality due to fire look like?
21:46
Where will that happen and when?
21:48
How about mortality that’s just due to drought?
21:51
It could be chronic drought or extreme drought.
21:54
You could have a really bad, hot, dry summer that impacts those forests for a
21:58
few years if you’re working with forests and then in addition you can just have
22:05
this chronic drought where it’s just hotter and dryer in general over a lot
22:09
of years and those are the things we’re trying to tease out and get the model
22:13
to do is predict mortality better.
22:15
When are trees doing to die in the future?
22:18
Where are they going to die and what are we going to do about it?
22:21
What is the importance of predicting mortality in particular?
22:25
It’s more, ecosystems so much relies on our picture of where forests should
22:34
be and what they should look like.
22:37
When you start impacting some species that are more sensitive
22:41
than others, you’re changing the whole dynamic of that ecosystem.
22:45
You’re losing animal species.
22:46
They have to move somewhere or they die.
22:51
My biggest concern is what’s going to happen to the animals?
22:54
What will happen to birds if they start losing habitat?
22:57
It’s not just a climate effect.
23:00
It’s also what are we doing to modify these systems to serve ourselves, and
23:05
that includes largescale cutting or frequent cutting of forests and changing
23:09
the species next to very few species.
23:11
We’re impacting biodiversity in a big way and we’re moving into that in our research
23:18
of what does that mean in the future.
23:21
A lot of what we do relies on animals, everything.
23:26
Our water comes from the watersheds of forests.
23:29
They hold water, they filter water and hold the water and how will that
23:34
affect water availability in the future?
23:38
Those are the things we’re going after is the effects on water
23:40
availability and biodiversity and we’ve always suspected that by just
23:45
we know this from observations.
23:47
I was also involved in a group that wrote a letter about how biodiversity
23:53
has been impacted over the last 20 years and we said that we’ve
23:55
got to do something about this.
23:56
We’ve lost something like 50% of the bird species already in my lifetime.
24:01
I’m just floored by that.
24:03
I grew up hearing all these different birds.
24:06
Rachel Carson was right.
24:11
Anyway, that’s why or where we’re going with this.
24:15
We want to be able to head it off.
24:18
We want to be able to help people figure out how do we minimize our impact
24:23
without too much impact on humans and too much impact on everything else.
24:30
It’s about minimizing impacts and modifying our behavior.
24:34
We have to do that.
24:35
Our population’s climbing to 9 billion in my lifetime and I’m
24:38
going to grow to over 100 years old.
24:41
I’m going to be seeing things and I’m going to say why didn’t
24:43
you do something about it?
24:46
There have been many people who have been trying to at least provide the information
24:50
so that we can be better informed about what we might be able to do.
24:56
Policy takes about—10% of their decision making is on the science.
25:02
That’s got to improve because we’re heading to this place
25:06
that we don’t want to.
25:08
Nobody wants to go there.
25:11
I think I see the urgency now and in our annual meetings 30,000 scientists
25:15
in American Geophysical Union all meet in December and when all the fellows,
25:22
I’m an AGU fellow, when we’ve all gotten together in a big meeting room
25:27
and had speakers, like Jerry Brown came to speak, we see the urgency.
25:31
We feel it.
25:32
It’s no longer, well if I just keep cranking out the science
25:37
maybe somebody will grab it.
25:38
We’ve got to communicate it better.
25:43
You’ve written about forests carbon sinks.
25:48
Can you talk about how forests store carbon?
25:52
Forests store carbon in
25:56
their wood, in their leaves, live and dead wood, and in the soil.
26:06
Oregon and Pacific Northwest, this is where carbon is king.
26:10
These forests not only can live to 1,000 years or more of age, they
26:17
keep in taking up carbon every year.
26:19
They don’t stop taking up carbon.
26:22
But they can store it for hundreds of years in the live
26:25
material and the dead material.
26:29
These forests in general have long clear stems and they were around with fire.
26:35
There here still after 600, 800 years, and we do have a lot—not a lot—but
26:40
we have that in our plot data where there are trees that old and they’ve
26:45
lived through fires before and made it.
26:47
It’s because of that thick bark and their branches are way high
26:49
so the flames don’t get to them.
26:54
You can store it for hundreds of years in the forest and why not keep it there?
26:59
It takes no effort other than to protect them.
27:02
I don’t mean all forests.
27:04
There are so many, about half of the forests in Oregon are privately managed
27:08
and now they’re on a 4-year rotation, meaning they cut them every 4 years, even
27:12
though they could live to 1,000 years.
27:15
Recent analysis we did was we showed if you just increase that
27:20
harvest cycle, let them live for another, you know, until about age
27:24
125 and that’s where productivity peaks in these forests out here.
27:29
It doesn’t mean it stops again, it’s just where that rapid ascent slows down.
27:36
If they allowed that to happen, we would be storing so much
27:39
more carbon in these forests.
27:40
That means carbon that’s in the forest is not in the atmosphere
27:44
so they’re doing the work for us.
27:46
Stop cutting them down and really rapidly putting that carbon into the atmosphere.
27:51
That’s what happens with bioenergy, etc. We’ve developed a life cycle
27:57
assessment where we track the carbon once it leaves the forest.
28:01
We can tell you how much over time, maybe by 2025, 2050, 2100, how much carbon has
28:08
gone into the atmosphere from our uses.
28:11
It’s commonly thought that it stays in buildings for a hundred years and
28:17
then it’s awash, but that’s not true.
28:20
If you talk to contractors, the architects who are designing buildings
28:25
into the future, they’re designing them to last 40 years, 45 years.
28:30
My own childhood home that was beautiful on lake with Andersen
28:34
windows torn down to the
28:38
foundation and a big giant house was built there.
28:43
That was at 50 years of age.
28:47
That house was torn down.
28:49
Where did that wood go?
28:50
A lot of it goes into landfill and then it decomposes.
28:53
It doesn’t just stay there.
28:54
We track it through all of that.
28:57
We have probably the most robust, if not the most robust, one of the
29:02
most robust life cycle assessments to do this tracking and that’s what
29:08
needs to be done so we not only track what’s happening the forest but what’s
29:11
happening once it leaves the forest.
29:14
We’re looking at it from the forest perspective and from
29:17
the atmospheric perspective.
29:19
What kind of responses have you gotten from individuals in land management
29:22
agencies when you talk about managing forests as carbon sinks, as opposed
29:26
to how they’re currently managed?
29:28
It’s funny, when you talk about the research branch they get it.
29:34
But in some of the agencies they have in management and applications
29:40
they’re not communicating or they’re not listening to each other.
29:46
Or, they are, and some of the people who might hear the science won’t accept
29:51
the science and they’re going the way of
29:56
let’s just keep thinning forests because we need the money.
30:00
As it turns out, with one of the agencies
30:05
it’s kind of fund money.
30:06
It’s money that actually supports staff.
30:09
They have an incentive to thin forests.
30:13
It’s not related to what does it do for forests.
30:17
It’s what is it doing for their staff.
30:21
That’s kind of a tough position to be in.
30:26
It’s interesting like the Starkers locally are foresters and we’ve
30:30
worked, we have a tower on their land.
30:33
It got clear cut so we had to take the tower down because it no longer
30:36
represented the age of forests that we had and it was a large area.
30:40
Nonetheless, they were still interested in hearing what we’re finding out.
30:45
I think one of the things that we and others have influenced is saying,
30:50
you know it’s not going to be the species that, there are going to be
30:53
winners and losers, and your best bet like in stock market is to diversify.
30:59
But
31:01
some of the species in that might be more resilient to drought and
31:06
do some mixes of species like that.
31:09
They’ve done that.
31:10
They have areas where they’ve experimented previously, and I’ve seen
31:15
right in the area that they’ve cut they have maybe 12 species in there.
31:19
That’s fantastic.
31:20
They got the message.
31:25
What are ways in which forest nutrient cycles can be changed or
31:29
disrupted by global climate change?
31:33
The way trees use carbon when they take it up in photosynthesis
31:39
is they need enough nitrogen.
31:41
There’s this carbon, nitrogen linkage.
31:43
They need enough nitrogen to be able to use that and assimilate it into tissues.
31:50
They get the nitrogen from the soil.
31:57
When there is increased atmospheric C02 it does have an enhancement effect.
32:02
We’ve seen that.
32:02
We just published this in Nature where we’re seeing this in our flux sites,
32:08
where the increased carbon dioxide is the largest influence on the increase
32:15
in carbon uptake by those forests, mostly because of the photosynthesis.
32:20
There are two things going on.
32:21
Photosynthesis is taking it up.
32:22
Respiration is putting carbon back in the atmosphere.
32:24
It’s just the cost of doing business.
32:26
Carbon
32:30
dioxide happens that way but if you only model for the carbon dioxide, the enhanced
32:34
carbon dioxide and you don’t account for nitrogen limitations then you’re going to
32:38
way overshoot on the estimate of how much photosynthesis will occur in the future.
32:45
The other thing is when you harvest frequently you’re reducing
32:48
and then moving that material.
32:50
Most of the nitrogen is in the leaves and the roots, but there’s also nitrogen
32:54
in the main stems and in the branches.
32:58
If you harvest more and more frequently, you’re reducing
33:01
the nitrogen in the forest.
33:03
That’s what happened in the southeast.
33:04
When I did my bachelors down there and my research down there, that was
33:10
maybe in the second rotation of their forests or third rotation of their
33:12
forests in the early ‘70s and mid ‘70s, but now they have to fertilize
33:18
2 to 4 times during their harvest because they’ve completely depleted
33:23
the organic layer in the soil, and it’s sand, and that’s what they need to do.
33:29
Now it’s a crop, it’s like an agricultural crop.
33:32
Well, what’s wrong with that?
33:33
Nitrogen, N20, nitrogen dioxide is now, it’s also a long term
33:39
greenhouse gas and it’s much more powerful than carbon dioxide.
33:43
Now you’re adding this long term gas into the atmosphere at a much
33:48
faster rate than we were before.
33:50
This might happen with crops too.
33:53
We don’t know, but there are people who are working on that more specifically
33:59
and work on all the other vegetation.
34:01
We do also work on crops, but I don’t work on the nitrogen part of that story.
34:05
That’s a
34:07
big concern.
34:08
There are major long-term greenhouse gases.
34:10
I worked on a national research counsel committee’s document for
34:14
the national academies on those effects, how to quantify and verify
34:21
greenhouses gas emissions for treaty agreements, or international agreements.
34:25
We had to remind them of that.
34:27
The biggest concern is the N2O that’s going to the atmosphere from crops
34:33
because of the additions to the crops.
34:36
That’s a big concern.
34:37
There are methane emissions that has become more recently exposed
34:43
and that was from those kinds of measurements that I was telling you
34:45
we were doing on our tall towers.
34:47
We have methane measurements in those too.
34:49
This company down in California discovered that when they were—he took me on a
34:53
drive and showed me see these spikes?
34:55
In
34:58
this case it was in methane.
35:00
He was showing me they have screen on the car, we’re riding in a
35:04
Prius and we’re measuring as we’re driving south of San Francisco.
35:08
We went by these big tanks that stored gas.
35:11
We thought maybe we’d be capturing methane from that.
35:14
But, no, there might have been a little background but we’re seeing giant spikes.
35:18
It turned out it was the pipeline for methane that ran
35:21
from San Francisco down south.
35:22
It turned out all of their joints leaked.
35:25
Now that’s become a big deal.
35:28
Those who are methane—they usually burn off methane at oil wells?
35:33
They need to do something about that because that’s a
35:35
very powerful greenhouse gas.
35:38
A lot of these things have evolved.
35:39
It’s not just about carbon dioxide.
35:41
We’ve had to think about the nitrogen component, methane and other gases
35:47
that are the long-lived gases.
35:49
I got a little off topic on that, but it really is one of those things where
35:53
I’m always thinking about the forest or the land based response and how
35:58
that might be impacting things and I’m thinking about the atmospheric issues.
36:02
We’re finding more of this, why?
36:06
Could you talk about your work on disturbance in terms of releasing
36:12
carbon into the atmosphere and comparing human disturbance, like
36:18
logging, versus natural disturbance, like naturally occurring wildfires?
36:23
Yeah, this was something that’s a paper that’s going to come out in proceedings
36:29
in the national academy of science.
36:31
It’s something we’ve been working on for a very long time.
36:36
It turns out that, and we did this analysis for Oregon but we’re doing
36:41
it for all the western U.S., it turns out that first of all about in Oregon
36:49
83% of the above ground biomass mortality in forests is due to harvest.
36:56
Only about 8% is due to fire.
36:59
This is from 2002-2012.
37:02
About 9% due to beetles, or it’s reversed.
37:06
Beetles less.
37:06
We don’t have as much here as we do—so we did this over the western U.S. First
37:10
of all, it was just through observations.
37:13
For the whole western U.S. about 50% or more of the above ground biomass
37:19
mortalities, that means all the wood above-ground biomass, is from harvest.
37:25
It is the largest impact both at our state level and at the regional level
37:31
and the beetles and fire are minor when it comes to the carbon that’s lost.
37:37
Fire isn’t what people think.
37:40
When you see all that smoke it’s mostly water vapor.
37:44
Everybody gets alarmed and you see pictures in the press.
37:47
And it really is sad to see fires burn and see what happens, but in
37:52
terms of carbon it’s not that much carbon goes into the atmosphere.
37:56
We did things like we went in after fires and worked on a lot of fires.
38:01
We first take, we measure how deep did the char go in the trees.
38:07
The bark, like we were saying, the bark on these trees really protects them.
38:11
The moisture in the trees protects them.
38:16
There is not as much carbon that goes into the atmosphere from fires as people
38:19
think, too, and not as much is lost when you think about, well, all the people down
38:26
in the southeast where I used to live.
38:28
They used to char their fences to preserve it.
38:31
That’s pretty much what it does.
38:32
It’s sort of like a rind that forms around the trees when they burn and
38:37
that takes a while to flake off.
38:40
Decomposition really doesn’t start going until the wood hits the ground,
38:44
but again it stays there for 100 years.
38:48
You have to look at the amount of carbon and where it goes over time.
38:55
From the land management perspective, if harvest is the biggest cause
38:59
for mortality, then that means when you take that out of the forest
39:05
it’s putting it into those rapid pulls, like what’s used for paper.
39:14
There’s short lived products and then there are longer lived products and
39:19
so it goes into the atmosphere much faster than it would from the forest.
39:25
But this one that the paper’s that’s in review, we’re basically showing
39:29
how we need to lengthen the harvest cycles, protect larger areas.
39:33
This is climate mitigation when you’re trying to reduce
39:38
the impacts of climate change.
39:39
Reduce the amount of carbon that’s going into the atmosphere and increase
39:42
the amount that’s stored in forests.
39:43
You don’t do it by fertilizing them more because of the nitrogen issue.
39:48
You don’t want to make them too dense, because they might
39:51
be competing for water then.
39:53
But you could add reforest areas that were previously forests,
39:58
that means less than 50 years ago.
40:01
A lot of times there are fields where people just let them—they abandon the
40:04
fields or they’re used for something else.
40:07
Those could be reforested.
40:09
Then there are areas that could be afforested and that would be
40:11
non-forage or non-food crops.
40:15
We’ve run scenarios and showed where if you took maybe 150,000 hectors
40:22
of non-forage, non-food grass crops.
40:27
They’re only used for grass seed and we would aforest those and then we would
40:32
reforest those other areas and then we would lengthen those rotations of the
40:38
forest when they cut 80-125 years that we could increase the amount of carbon stored
40:45
in forests significantly over Oregon.
40:49
It’s a lot more likely to find that over other regions, but, again,
40:52
Oregon and Washington and California all the way up to Alaska, southeast
40:57
Alaska, that’s where carbon is king.
40:58
It’s the biggest storage, temperate rainforests, storage of carbon and
41:06
it’s often been ignored in that sense, that this is a place where you would
41:10
if you’re thinking over a larger scale, like a politician in Washington, D.C.,
41:14
would, what you do is you should have more protected area in these large
41:17
forests that really do a good job of taking up carbon and keeping it there.
41:22
So, it sounds like land management decisions post disturbance, those
41:29
are pretty important decisions when it comes to storing carbon.
41:31
Yeah, extremely important to
41:36
think about carbon like a currency.
41:39
If you store it there and there will likely be offset programs.
41:44
California started one.
41:45
Oregon is thinking about it, so is Washington, of helping by subsidizing
41:53
people like private forest landowners to just keep the carbon on the ground, keep
41:58
it in the forests and that would mean that lengthening the rotations or setting
42:03
aside land that will just stay that way.
42:09
Those are actions that are likely to occur in forward thinking areas and
42:14
they should occur in this region.
42:17
You can’t tell people what to do but we can say this is what
42:20
happens if you do do this.
42:21
This is an option and this is a way to get there.
42:28
Can you talk about how
42:31
bioenergy plays a role in carbon sequestration and maybe compare the
42:35
Pacific Northwest to the Southeast?
42:37
Sure.
42:42
I had gone to Washington, D.C., and I was asked what were my thoughts on, this was
42:47
President Obama’s climate action plan.
42:49
It was about using renewable resources, but before then I had started
42:56
thinking this is in the mix, this is what people are talking about.
43:02
I wanted to see assessments of what is the life cycle assessment of how
43:07
much carbon goes into the atmosphere from wind, solar, and from bioenergy?
43:14
Other people are working on the other two and I have the results on that.
43:19
They’re pretty much the way to go, wind and solar.
43:23
But when we started looking at our results from different levels of
43:26
thinning from bioenergy, we did this in Oregon, we did light thinning.
43:30
Just for over the forested area in the state and areas where you
43:37
might have fire more frequent.
43:40
That would be the dry systems, like Ponderosa pine.
43:45
We ran one that was economically feasible and one that was for
43:49
bioenergy production as something that had to be done and so that it
43:53
was something to maintain the systems.
43:55
We’re still doing that.
43:56
We’re doing this now for the Boardman facility.
44:00
Not for them.
44:01
We know that they want to change.
44:03
It’s the last coal fire powered plant in Oregon and they want
44:06
to change to another source.
44:09
So, I’m on the Oregon global warming commission, the
44:11
science technology committee.
44:14
We’ve been informing them.
44:16
They’re energy people.
44:17
The head of it has a hat for each one of these groups that he meets with.
44:22
I said when I look at it, and look at our results, you end up with more emissions
44:27
from using bioenergy, net emissions to the atmosphere, than you would from using
44:32
solar, and I would say the no brainer is to go solar if you had to choose.
44:39
We’ve interacted that way.
44:42
I’ve actually like talking with energy folks because they do want
44:47
to find solutions that are feasible.
44:49
So, we’ve done repeated analyses and one was more observation based.
44:56
That was our first Nature paper.
44:59
Then we did another one that was using the observations to train the
45:02
model and run it into the future.
45:03
So we have climate effects.
45:05
The only areas we would thin are areas that might be impacted by forest.
45:10
Then we’ve improved on that even further.
45:12
We’re doing this for the whole western U.S. and we used Oregon
45:17
as our pilot study on that.
45:22
So, when you’re doing those levels of thinning, though, and just doing the
45:27
forests that might be vulnerable to mortality from fire, or from drought,
45:35
that bioenergy use of that wood for bioenergy still produced more emissions
45:41
than just leaving in the forest.
45:44
The difference there is that bioenergy uses the wood immediately, so it
45:49
goes into the atmosphere immediately.
45:53
The previous scenarios that we run for the life cycle assessment are based
45:57
on what people are actually doing.
45:58
How much is going into saw timber?
46:00
How much into paper?
46:01
How much into bioenergy?
46:03
This recent run, we just ran residuals,
46:07
residues.
46:07
If forests usually they’ll cut the tops off and the branches off and leave them
46:12
on site but if they use that for bioenergy what does that mean for emissions?
46:17
It still ends up being a net emission to the atmosphere and we run out of residue.
46:23
That means they’d have to go farther and farther away to get those residues.
46:29
We’d have to go into Washington and it still won’t supply even
46:33
half of what that facility needed.
46:35
It’s a 570 megawatt facility.
46:38
It’s not enough.
46:39
It’s not sustainable.
46:41
That’s what they’re worried about.
46:42
If they’re planning out for the next 30 years of this new facility,
46:45
we’re going no you’re going to run out in 20 years, 10 years.
46:49
That means they’re going to end up using other wood.
46:52
What do they end up using?
46:53
They’ll start thinning the forest more than they have been.
46:58
We’ve done all that and we’ve quantified this for Oregon and now
47:01
we’re doing it for western U.S. and that’ll be done in a couple months.
47:06
I worked in the southeast U.S. and saw—these have been in crops for a
47:11
number of years, those forests there, the pine forests, southern yellow pine.
47:17
They were on the short cycle of maybe 20 years.
47:20
Well, they put some facilities down in the southeast and they needed wood
47:27
but it’s not just to serve the U.S. I think there’s a lot of confusion.
47:31
People think this makes us energy independent.
47:33
You hear these words all the time from politicians.
47:38
It’s not being used for that.
47:39
It’s being shipped overseas to Europe and so you have a
47:44
carbon cost from the shipping.
47:45
You have a carbon cost from trains bringing wood from everywhere and trucks.
47:50
That’s carbon into the atmosphere.
47:54
That’s probably the next one we’ll do because I’m very familiar with
47:57
those forests is run that scenario with our system model and then
48:01
running it through our life cycle assessment on what happens with it.
48:05
Some other people have done some kind of analysis on this first
48:09
analysis and they’re concerned about what happens to the forest there.
48:16
They have flown over these areas and taken photos of the facilities
48:21
and then nearby forest and they were harvesting bottomland hardwoods.
48:25
Bottomlands hardwoods are very special in the southeast.
48:29
That’s where wildlife travelled along and lived along the waterways.
48:35
These trees are very old and it took them very long time to get that old.
48:40
They’re harvesting beautiful old hardwoods and using it to make pellets and shipping
48:45
them overseas to burn and go into the atmosphere, which is a perverse incentive.
48:52
Why would you do this?
48:54
It’s been this claim and you’ll see at the federal level a claim of carbon
48:59
neutrality that bioenergy is carbon neutral as saying it’s okay, it’s okay.
49:03
The trees will grow back rapidly.
49:04
No they don’t grow back fast.
49:06
They just don’t.
49:08
They won’t grow fast enough and furthermore you’re having somebody else
49:12
that didn’t cut their lands pay for the carbon you removed from that property.
49:20
It ends up when you look at this and really quantify it it’s really
49:27
bad news in terms of atmospheric carbon dioxide because nobody’s
49:30
accounting for what’s directly being burned nor the carbon that’s
49:33
being used to produce this material.
49:38
Wood is not as efficient as other materials.
49:43
You have to burn more of it.
49:45
One of the things you have to do is dry the wood.
49:47
So, that’s heat.
49:49
They heat to 250 to somewhere around 300 degrees.
49:53
Guess what that took?
49:54
Energy.
49:55
So, what do they do for that energy if they have those facilities distributed
49:58
near forests to reduce their transport costs, you know so they have to take
50:03
less trips because it weighs less.
50:05
Half of weight—not half, but somewhere around 25% of the weight is water.
50:10
It takes a lot of heat and a lot of energy to do that.
50:13
They burn more trees right there to dry it down to take it to a facility.
50:18
If they air dry it, it’s not so bad.
50:21
That’s what you see in the southeast, there’s just wood trees everywhere.
50:24
Whole stems piled and fanned out air drying and then the most efficient, the
50:32
people who do energy work have shown it’s the most efficient thing is to
50:36
dry, is to torrefy it, but they’re not thinking about the emissions from that.
50:41
They’re only thinking about what’s the most efficient way to get the
50:43
wood to where it’s suitable in this carbon-like flakey like material
50:49
that you would burn for energy.
50:51
There’s a lot more processing that’s involved that has a lot
50:55
of carbon associated with it.
50:58
So, it’s also a problem at the international level.
51:02
I’ve been in an IPCC expert meeting where I was asked to explain this to them.
51:07
I said, you’ve got to track the carbon.
51:09
You’ve got to know what’s being used for bioenergy.
51:11
When it leaves the forest, everybody, every country needs to do this.
51:16
Then they will realize just how bad it is because we can use our LCA and we can use
51:22
it anywhere in the world and show how much carbon that’s adding to the atmosphere.
51:31
Then what’s worse about it is their incentives for this
51:36
as an alternative energy.
51:37
They’re getting paid to add more carbon to the atmosphere.
51:42
It’s a perverse incentive.
51:45
Why am I railing on it?
51:47
It seems like a very simple thing for us to head off, but scientists
51:52
have now written many letters and the politicians are ignoring it.
51:56
So, I think they have some of their own interests involved
52:01
that might be affecting that.
52:03
We wrote our own Oregon senators, people from all over the world,
52:08
and then just people from Oregon and said it is not carbon neutral.
52:12
It’s adding it to the atmosphere.
52:13
These are people who are concerned about climate change, but they
52:16
are willing to look the other way.
52:18
That’s bad.
52:21
Sometimes I think we need more scientists in the policy.
52:26
I think we have one Ph.D. in congress right now.
52:30
We need more.
52:33
You mentioned your work with Oregon Global Warming Commission and you also
52:39
testified before congress and senate.
52:43
How has your experience in communicating science to
52:45
politicians been and what do you—?
52:52
I have a lot more, let’s see, satisfaction talking with their staffers.
53:00
Their staffers are sponges for information and many of them
53:06
are just really talented people.
53:09
They understand what you’re saying.
53:11
They pick it up.
53:14
When I went to Office Management & Budget they had a lot of climate scientists
53:17
there and we were in a big boardroom and these guys knew how when I said the
53:21
probability of this happening—they know probabilities because it’s what they do.
53:26
A lot of statistics there and they were climate people.
53:30
So, when we would talk about the probability of fire versus the
53:32
probability of harvesting and how that affects the carbon to the atmosphere
53:37
they were soaking it up but when you come to the politicians and I talked
53:41
with our state politicians—I won’t name names, but they will say jobs, jobs!
53:47
They’ll have their—what they say to the public in general is
53:52
what comes out of their mouth.
53:53
They’re not really saying what they think.
53:58
So, it’s trying to get them to look at you and listen and really think about
54:03
what this means over the long term.
54:05
If we lose these forests because of other reasons are making it worse,
54:13
what do you think it’s going to mean in the next 20 to 50 to 100 years?
54:16
It’s going to be your legacy.
54:17
I’ll be here.
54:18
Again, getting blamed for it.
54:21
Because I’m the only one alive.
54:23
There’s just a few of us left.
54:27
How has—I guess reflecting back on your experience communicating science
54:30
in general have you changed as a science communicator over the years
54:35
or do you think about it differently?
54:37
You mentioned a sense of urgency now.
54:39
Yeah, a sense of urgency.
54:43
Yeah, I mean there are some of the things like okay when you’re testifying
54:47
to congress, and when I did this was during the Bush administration, most of
54:51
it, and also the Obama administration.
54:54
Both of them.
54:55
What a stark contrast and when congress was dominated by one party versus another.
55:01
It’s a cat and mouse game and having taken a law course and being around lawyers a
55:07
lot I know how they operate and so you know when you’re trying to be trapped.
55:13
You have to think a few steps out in front.
55:16
Not everybody did this.
55:17
There were great people that were just writing and listening and soaking it up.
55:21
Barbara Boxer from California.
55:25
They were really listening so you might have half the group that’s really
55:29
listening and half the group that’s trying to make you look like an idiot,
55:34
trying to ruffle your feathers, trying to take the information and twist it in
55:41
their direction and then the cameras are running and they want to be caught on
55:45
camera as saying something for whoever paid them, whoever is paying them.
55:51
My father’s often said they need to wear badges like NASCAR drivers who is paying
55:56
you and the size of the badge is relevant to the size of the funding that they get.
56:03
There’s a lot of that and so when you go in there you have
56:07
to know this is what happens.
56:09
A lot of people go there and are very disillusioned by it.
56:13
I figured if I could just reach a few people it matters, and
56:21
so I think you have to talk to people at many different levels.
56:24
This goes back to when I was working with AT&T.
56:28
I learned how to talk with people at different levels of the organization
56:31
to see how they get information, what information and how they’ll deal with
56:35
it, how to describe it and then talking across organizations and people who
56:42
really want to do something about it and sometimes it’s really gratifying.
56:46
Other times you think oh my gosh I just wasted three days.
56:51
You can’t let that stop you and you can’t get disillusioned by it because who
56:56
knows better about this than scientists?
57:01
I have a colleague who’s just retired who’s often said they trust economists,
57:07
politicians trust economists better than they trust earth system scientists.
57:12
Which is amazing because our models are much more complicated
57:16
than the economics models.
57:19
You’ll often hear oh we forgot to put that in the model and then we
57:22
had this giant economic crash, but
57:27
why would they trust economists when their models are so simplified, so
57:31
simple compared to what we work with?
57:34
We are really our worst critics.
57:37
We’re always trying to reduce uncertainty in our estimates, always
57:41
and we’re always looking at what we’re finding and trying to be very honest
57:45
and direct about what we’re finding.
57:50
That’s what disillusions a lot of people is they still won’t listen,
57:54
but you can’t let that stop you.
57:56
We’re really the people who know this the best.
58:00
If somebody listens then we might get somewhere.
58:03
Somebody listens and that matters.
58:07
How did you get involved with the intergovernmental panel on climate change?
58:14
I was invited to expert meetings, so one was on disturbance and
58:19
that was in Geneva, Switzerland.
58:21
We were trying to figure out what kind of observation systems we needed.
58:24
It was early on to really do these kinds of estimates of how forests are going
58:30
to be disturbed and how they’re going to respond to future climate and how
58:34
they might influence future climate.
58:37
I was on that expert panel and this goes back I think about all the things
58:43
that I’ve done to build towards this when I was working on developing the
58:46
forest self-monitoring program for the U.S., I was thinking about what is
58:49
the network of observations you need and what are all the tools that will
58:52
use those observations to give you a really good picture of what’s going on,
58:55
a much better picture than we are now.
58:59
So, I’ve been on several of those IPCC expert panels.
59:03
We’re invited to help them learn how to improve methods that might have to span,
59:10
you know I had plan A, B, and C depending on the capabilities of each country.
59:16
Some of it was in the countries that have more capabilities, like satellites,
59:21
the U.S. and Europe and other countries like Brazil, how to take those
59:26
observations and use them and get a picture of what’s happening to forests.
59:31
So, once your name is in there and they see what you’ve done and I’ve written
59:36
a manual on protocols for observations.
59:41
That thing is being used a lot.
59:43
It was published by the FAO, the Food and Agricultural Organization, and
59:50
so it’s things that I’ve published, methods and then people who have
59:55
read my papers and say hey this person might be able to contribute.
59:58
It’s a very broad organization.
1:00:01
Thousands of people have contributed to understanding all that’s going on.
1:00:05
It’s so complex.
1:00:08
Now I’m going to move on to some broader questions on climate change.
1:00:12
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
1:00:15
have they shifted over time?
1:00:19
Earliest conversations—wow.
1:00:25
I don’t even actually know when [laughs] . I’m trying to think.
1:00:29
When did we first start talking about it?
1:00:33
I mean there are some things that I noticed when I was pretty young growing
1:00:37
up that some things were changing.
1:00:39
Most of the things I noticed that were changing were due to human
1:00:42
influence in other ways, but
1:00:51
I think that first it’s more of just direct observation that like when we
1:00:56
were running our Flex towers that group of 20 of us over the U.S. that had these
1:01:03
towers measuring above ecosystems and we were seeing changes in the photosynthesis
1:01:09
and the net carbon outtake from the atmosphere in particular because that’s
1:01:13
the direct measurement that we’re making and then while we’re doing that when
1:01:18
we see this whole number of net carbon uptake we had to figure out well what’s
1:01:22
responsible for that in all these parts?
1:01:24
We started measuring phenology and then we started seeing that
1:01:27
spring was coming 2 weeks earlier.
1:01:29
We’d have our annual meetings and I’d go spring came two weeks earlier
1:01:32
this year and somebody else in the southeast: it happened here, too!
1:01:35
It happened here, too!
1:01:37
Now that somebody had started about 6 years ago, he was hearing all this
1:01:42
in our meetings and we’ve got to get better at this phenology measurement.
1:01:46
We need something
1:01:48
that you could process like an image and process the same way and it’s continuous
1:01:54
measurement and he started putting these webcams up on all of our towers.
1:02:01
At Harvard, they have this record now of the seasonal phenology images every, I
1:02:07
think every month or it is continuous.
1:02:09
They’re not just monthly.
1:02:10
I think it’s every day and then select good images that
1:02:14
aren’t all fog or something.
1:02:17
You can see those images and how they’re processing they have about
1:02:20
like 6 years of data now and they’re starting to take that and say how is
1:02:26
this changing in these different areas and how is that associated with climate?
1:02:31
Phenology is an integrator of all these climate influences is temperature
1:02:36
and water availability, growing degree days, how light it is out.
1:02:41
You can be warmer and not light enough and not take as much carbon, but if
1:02:48
it’s warmer in a season and there’s enough light it might be taking up a
1:02:52
lot more carbon from the atmosphere.
1:02:56
Anyway, those are some of the things that we’ve done out of this and
1:03:00
it will go much farther than this.
1:03:02
Satellites do fly over and they might get better at quantifying
1:03:09
phenology but they don’t come by very often.
1:03:11
You either get one resolution or another, temporal or spatial resolution.
1:03:15
You have to give something up.
1:03:18
But I think they’ll get better at tracking this and like right
1:03:22
now we see it’s a simple index.
1:03:24
I did a lot of remote sensing in my Ph.D., but they can show the
1:03:31
greening up around the globe.
1:03:32
NASA has done a beautiful time series and showing the globe spinning and the
1:03:38
colors changing seasonally, so anyway.
1:03:44
Can you speak about the community of climate change researchers
1:03:47
here at OSU and maybe how the institution facilitates that research?
1:03:50
Yeah.
1:03:52
Research tends to happen organically.
1:03:56
We have a big idea and I’m one of those big idea people and then I thought
1:04:00
okay what do we need to carry this out.
1:04:03
When you start digging down and trying to solve the question or figure out
1:04:08
the answer to your question you start seeing, oh I need a climate modeler.
1:04:13
I need somebody that knows soil processes that can help us improve the soil model.
1:04:19
You start thinking about all the kinds of skills that you need.
1:04:24
In most cases, though I have people from all over the U.S. who work with me, but
1:04:30
we have a cadre of people here at OSU.
1:04:32
We have climate modelers and so there are people working in different areas,
1:04:40
like oceans, and people are working on estuaries and how carbon is moving into
1:04:44
estuaries as you get more runoff from the land and it goes out in the rivers to
1:04:49
the ocean, there’s more sedimentation and people measure blue carbon here at OSU.
1:04:55
We keep saying we have to work with each other but I don’t have
1:04:57
a blue carbon component yet.
1:04:58
I might do that, but
1:05:03
we wrote a proposal.
1:05:04
There was one we wrote to NASA to quantify this off the Gulf of Alaska where we
1:05:09
wanted to see, because it’s braided.
1:05:11
There’s just a lot of water moving in first order streams and taking
1:05:15
carbon to the ocean and we don’t know how much is ending up in sediments
1:05:18
and how much is just recycling.
1:05:21
We have a lot of those skills here at OSU.
1:05:25
OCCRI, the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, before OCCRI existed, I worked
1:05:29
as part of the Center for Analysis on Environmental Change out of the College
1:05:34
of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences.
1:05:36
We were provided seed grants for groups to think about how do we get the
1:05:41
right people to work on these ideas.
1:05:43
That was a great experience for me and then OSU decided to have a climate
1:05:51
along with some state funding, climate research institute, and Phil came along,
1:05:56
Phil Mote, and they have a group there.
1:05:59
What helped me is what we ended up saying I think the climate modelers
1:06:06
are getting the climate wrong.
1:06:08
Future climate, when you come in from the ocean from the west, the whole west
1:06:12
coast, I think it’s not right because we’re not able to—when we look at the data
1:06:17
we pull the data out and run these and see what’s happening in the climate data
1:06:22
and the future and what it’s saying for the past to the present and we’re saying
1:06:26
I think it’s not getting it right because we’re not able to predict how highly
1:06:31
productive these forests actually are.
1:06:34
Then the climate science would say okay we need to look at that or we need to
1:06:39
look at atmospheric circulation and how that might change in the future off
1:06:42
the coast or does that regime change?
1:06:44
They’re not ready for us.
1:06:46
A lot of times a part moves faster than another part.
1:06:50
We’re always begging the climate scientists to catch up to us on a
1:06:53
regional scale and they’re wanting to know more of the feedbacks, so a
1:06:59
lot of times it’s a really energizing because you’re finally getting people
1:07:06
who should be spending all of their time instead of us trying to do everything,
1:07:10
we have downscaled the climate data.
1:07:12
We have done a lot of the testing ourselves, but we need the climate
1:07:15
people to do that so they can figure out how they can improve the data inputs.
1:07:20
So,
1:07:24
it’s organic.
1:07:26
It was useful when you have an organization that when I’m writing,
1:07:30
I’m doing all the big thinking.
1:07:32
I’m tunneled down and I can’t think about anything else.
1:07:35
When it’s really hard on me is having to come out and just deal with filling
1:07:40
out forms online and doing budgets.
1:07:44
I do budgets really well.
1:07:45
I’ve done that since I was at AT&T and since I was working on acid rain.
1:07:49
I’ve always worked on budgets and big budgets, millions of dollars in budgets.
1:07:56
But I don’t want to do that.
1:07:57
I’ve got to work on the science part of it.
1:08:00
It would be really nice if OSU could take a much bigger role like they do at some
1:08:04
other institutions and so I try to tell research office this is what we need.
1:08:10
We need somebody to take this off our hands because we’re competing
1:08:13
against other institutions who have these people who just handle all
1:08:18
that for them so they can think.
1:08:22
So, anyway, that’s what it takes to have a winning proposal is having a
1:08:29
minds working together on this and people—one colleague calls it’s like jazz.
1:08:35
When you get the right group of people together and they’re going oh and this,
1:08:39
oh and this, oh and we can do this.
1:08:40
No we can’t do that.
1:08:42
Your minds are just joining and it’s really exciting when that happens
1:08:47
because you think okay, now we’ve got it.
1:08:49
We’ve got something that’s really important to do and
1:08:51
we’ve figured out how to do it.
1:08:56
How do you foresee, if you’re concerned about this being an issue, coping with
1:09:02
diminished funding for climate change research during the Trump administration?
1:09:07
Well, we’ve been through this before.
1:09:11
Those of us who have been through this before think just hold your
1:09:16
breath and we’ll be, sooner or later, we’ll be in a better position.
1:09:21
There’s been a general, actually, flatness of funding across agencies
1:09:25
for many years so that we have fewer and fewer staff to help us on these
1:09:29
projects and help us get there faster.
1:09:33
We’re always trying to be more creative about how we go about it.
1:09:38
There’s some institutions that they have more endowments, so those
1:09:44
universities that don’t, like OSU doesn’t have as much for research.
1:09:48
We don’t have many foundations funding research.
1:09:52
We need to get better at that.
1:09:54
That’s something else that I think has to happen.
1:09:58
We’ve been through it before and
1:10:03
we find ways to still get work done and
1:10:08
I’ve often described it as we work like stock brokers.
1:10:12
We work and work and work and I’m still working like a teenager, nights
1:10:16
and weekends trying to get this information all the way through to
1:10:22
publication and then communicating.
1:10:26
It’s hard on us and when I hear congressionals at hearings saying
1:10:31
oh you’re just in it for the money.
1:10:33
We just laugh.
1:10:33
You can’t laugh when you’re talking to congress but it’s right!
1:10:39
If I was in it for the money I’d be somewhere else.
1:10:43
It’s not about the money.
1:10:44
It’s about understanding what’s happening and trying to improve lives, all life.
1:10:54
What policy changes would you like to see happen within the U.S.
1:10:57
as it relates to climate change?
1:11:02
I think
1:11:05
that it’s not just policy, but I’ll get to that in a minute.
1:11:10
The policy changes would be to get smart and see what’s happening
1:11:16
and not make the problem worse.
1:11:20
They could incentivize storing carbon in new forests.
1:11:27
Big people buying up lands that’s not going to compete with food
1:11:30
and water and other issues and putting that back into forests.
1:11:38
The incentives could be shifted from other areas to storing carbon forests
1:11:45
and to subsidize solar and I think that’s going to be a primary source of energy.
1:11:51
We’ll see, however, but we’ll see but I think solar is probably
1:11:59
the best way to go right now.
1:12:01
We might have some new discoveries that find other sources of
1:12:05
energy that are not so impactful.
1:12:09
It’s funding that kind of research.
1:12:11
We don’t have much R&D in companies but one that stands out right now is
1:12:18
we wish we had more of us like Tesla, Elon Musk, the work that he’s doing.
1:12:24
He’s jumping, he’s hurtling, jumping over steps to get
1:12:28
places much faster than others.
1:12:30
That should incentivize others to be able to do that and see this is a
1:12:37
great opportunity what’s happening now.
1:12:39
It’s a great opportunity for people to think very differently.
1:12:42
It’s paradigm shifts.
1:12:43
It’s those who have the minds to make paradigm shifts, we’re
1:12:46
going to get out in front.
1:12:47
Everything else is going to be the buggy whip.
1:12:49
It’s just going to be irrelevant.
1:12:53
We’ll get there but we need more people like that and more corporations
1:12:58
that will put the effort into R&D instead of just focusing on the
1:13:03
stockholders to take us there.
1:13:07
There are ways.
1:13:08
There are people who found ways.
1:13:10
They’ve increased the competition and that might drive things
1:13:14
towards the right direction to go.
1:13:16
The policy makers are going to be the followers.
1:13:20
The people and the industries will be the leaders and it’s unfortunate but at least
1:13:29
they could for now shift their subsidies to the winning routes that we see forward.
1:13:38
What changes to public education do you think help Americans
1:13:42
better understand climate change or maybe change their behavior?
1:13:47
There are people who say, that think education is not going to go anywhere.
1:13:51
Well, it does.
1:13:52
I lived in the south.
1:13:53
I know what it’s like when the teachers are buying books, and I’ll tell—I
1:13:57
had a friend when I was in college, or lived in Athens, Georgia, and I
1:14:02
was doing research there on soils.
1:14:05
She was buying books for her class because they didn’t have
1:14:08
enough books for the students.
1:14:10
They didn’t have the right books for the students.
1:14:12
She was asking for advice, what are the good books?
1:14:17
I think the web has helped us a lot in discovery of good literature and
1:14:21
it’s really been a proliferation of good literature out there
1:14:24
that could be used in education.
1:14:26
We’re also having these online courses for people who can’t,
1:14:30
you know for college if you can’t afford to go maybe all four years.
1:14:35
I envision that maybe half of their coursework will be done online.
1:14:41
Education is really important.
1:14:43
We need to do a much better job of it.
1:14:45
There are a lot of new classes that are being developed.
1:14:49
I have a class that’s on global change and it’s really on, it covers
1:14:54
not only the topic itself and what’s happening in oceans and atmospheres
1:14:59
and to wildlife and to everything.
1:15:02
They’re having to learn how to communicate and it’s using
1:15:06
the Leopold program methods.
1:15:12
For the students who really grab onto it, I see some who have become
1:15:17
wildly successful in their careers in helping communities find solutions
1:15:23
and they’ve gotten funding to do that.
1:15:27
There are different ways of teaching the teachers and then
1:15:30
teaching the students and do it in novel ways and it’s happening.
1:15:34
It’s happening very quickly.
1:15:38
I think that education component has been really good and is getting much better.
1:15:44
There are many of us who talk about what will universities look like in the
1:15:47
future and I do see fewer buildings and more of the labs because that’s what you
1:15:52
need to be there for is the immersion, the labs and being in the environment
1:15:58
you can’t just do everything online, but the basic things you can do online.
1:16:05
I think universities will be different.
1:16:07
Right now, they’ve gone the corporate route where industry determines what
1:16:11
we learn in a lot of the fields.
1:16:14
I don’t think that’s the right way to go because it could go retro on the time.
1:16:19
Just for some of the areas it could go retro instead of looking forward.
1:16:25
You have to be careful about that.
1:16:26
They are helpful in many ways.
1:16:28
But in some ways, it’s slowing progress.
1:16:32
I
1:16:35
think there are a lot of people who are trying to figure out how to do this and
1:16:37
now there are people who are working on making their online courses or their
1:16:43
in-class courses available online.
1:16:47
There are some good programs for people who are older and retired and want
1:16:51
to learn and people like my father.
1:16:54
He’s learning a lot from me and I thought it was wonderful to hear that
1:16:57
he’ll go out for dinner and start explaining things to the waitresses.
1:17:00
There’s learning in many ways.
1:17:07
We have to get better at the education.
1:17:08
I think education is not all that great in some areas.
1:17:13
Amazingly for the U.S. to have such poor education in areas like in math
1:17:18
and science compared to other countries.
1:17:21
When I see what they’re—I hire the best and the brightest and a lot of them come
1:17:26
over from Germany and China and Korea and other places in Europe and Italians.
1:17:35
They had much better mathematical skills than the number of people
1:17:38
that we’re turning out with those skills to do earth system modeling.
1:17:43
The kinds of high level analysis, we do neural network analysis.
1:17:50
The U.S. does need to improve education.
1:17:52
It’s usually an afterthought.
1:17:53
If funding in states is reduced it comes out of education a lot of times.
1:17:58
We’ve just got to change that.
1:18:02
It has to start all the way from K-12 on up.
1:18:08
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
1:18:12
I guess for me I’m really, really hopeful because I’m going to be here
1:18:17
and I want it to be the environment that I love not something that is
1:18:24
so totally changed that I have to migrate from here to somewhere else.
1:18:29
I’m
1:18:34
a survivor and I think that’s in my blood and it’s in generations
1:18:38
of Laws to be survivors.
1:18:41
My great grandmother was in basement all winter.
1:18:43
Their house burned down and she lived in the basement in Minnesota and winter
1:18:47
and survived, she and her daughter.
1:18:49
We’re survivors.
1:18:50
We know these stories and so I’m forever hopeful that we’ll find a way.
1:18:56
The human race will realize we have a higher calling and that higher
1:19:01
calling is the moral responsibility to protect this planet for the future.
1:19:09
Alright, well that’s the conclusion of our interview.
1:19:12
Okay.
1:19:13
Thank you for participating.
1:19:14
I appreciate it.
1:19:14
You’re welcome.
