00:01
Today is December 14, 2017.
00:04
We’re here at the Valley Library with Dr. Peter Ruggiero, a professor in the College
00:10
of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.
00:13
Today we’re going to talk about your career and research as
00:16
it relates to global warming.
00:18
First, I like to start out with your background.
00:21
Where were you born?
00:22
I was born in New York City, but I only lived in New York for a couple
00:26
years and then we moved to New England.
00:28
I grew up primarily in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
00:31
What did your parents do?
00:33
My mother was a schoolteacher my whole life and my father worked
00:36
for AT&T for about 40 years.
00:41
What were your interests growing up?
00:42
Did you spend time outdoors?
00:45
Yep.
00:46
We did a lot of things outdoors as a family.
00:49
We skied and camped but a lot of my interests stemmed from spending
00:54
time on the beach and sailing.
00:56
We always had a sailboat.
00:58
When we lived in Connecticut we sailed on a lake and then we moved
01:00
to Massachusetts and I sailed in the greater Boston Harbor area, and so spent
01:04
a lot of time on the water, a lot of time on beaches, both in the area of
01:08
soft shore Boston and Cape Cod as well.
01:13
Were you initially interested in going into engineering and science as a child?
01:19
No.
01:20
Probably didn’t think much about career as a child but just enjoyed all of those
01:24
kinds of activities, probably like a lot of kids who could have excelled in
01:30
math and sciences in high school had guidance counselors that said well you
01:35
should go try engineering as a degree and so I went to Lehigh University in
01:41
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and quickly picked civil engineering just because
01:46
of the ability to work in water, kind of thinking I was going to do something
01:50
in fluid mechanics or hydraulics.
01:53
Then I think it was the end of my sophomore year when I realized there
01:56
were actually classes on the course syllabus called Coastal Engineering and
02:01
I had never even heard of it or thought it could be a potential profession.
02:05
I think starting along taking those classes really changed everything for me.
02:11
Were you exposed to undergraduate research there?
02:14
A little bit, yes.
02:15
Not in a very significant way but the professor who taught that class,
02:21
coastal engineering, I took the course from him and immediately knew this
02:25
is what I wanted to pursue and was deciding between getting a job after
02:30
undergraduate or continuing on to grad school, so I did a special projects
02:35
class with that professor as well.
02:37
It was a little bit of research.
02:39
We did some work in a wave tank.
02:40
We used some video techniques to measure waves.
02:43
As I said, it wasn’t very sophisticated.
02:46
It didn’t turn into a publication or any presentations, but it was a lot
02:49
of fun and learned a lot more about coastal processes and I think it was
02:54
one of the major reasons I decided to pursue graduate school rather
02:56
than getting a job after undergrad.
02:59
Did you plan on pursuing a Ph.D. initially?
03:03
Nope.
03:04
Definitely not.
03:05
Like a lot of things in my career, kind of things just sort of happened
03:08
to get me to where I eventually got.
03:11
But I came to OSU and did a master’s degree in the early ‘90s and I was
03:16
in the Coastal and Ocean Engineering program at the time and absolutely
03:22
I was here for a masters only.
03:24
They couldn’t have paid me to do a Ph.D. at the time.
03:28
But when I started taking classes and getting exposed to the research that my
03:32
colleagues were doing, other students, the professors here at OSU and particularly
03:37
getting involved in some of the work that was happening at the College of
03:40
Oceanography at the time, I realized that if I could stay and continue
03:47
for the degree, I would be happy to.
03:49
I was lucky to get that opportunity.
03:51
How did you decide on Oregon State?
03:56
Lots of options.
03:59
With an undergraduate in civil engineering, I applied to probably the
04:03
5 or so primary coastal engineering schools in the country and had a
04:09
couple of offers from different places, but I had spent a little bit
04:12
of time in the Pacific Northwest.
04:14
I actually spent a summer in Seattle, and it was primarily just place, not
04:18
necessarily the faculty per se or the program, although that was all fantastic.
04:23
It was really just wanting to come to the Pacific Northwest at the time.
04:27
What were your initial impressions of Corvallis when you first arrived?
04:30
I loved it.
04:31
From the second I got here I loved everything about it.
04:39
What does your background in civil engineering contribute to your
04:42
research in coastal morphology compared to say an oceanographer?
04:46
Yeah, that’s a great question.
04:46
I’ve always maintained that to do work in the near shore area where you’re
04:53
focused on morphological evolution, you kind of need to have the three-legged
04:58
stool of knowing something about coastal engineering, something about near shore
05:02
oceanography and also kind of coastal geology as well and so I think all
05:07
three of those disciplines feed into understanding near shore processes
05:11
and really sediment transport and morphological evolution at the coast.
05:16
But I would say to really answer your question, the engineering background
05:20
has made me have more of an applied focus than maybe a lot of people with
05:24
more of a pure science background.
05:27
The vast majority of my work is user inspired or use inspired.
05:32
You know, really kind of thinking along the lines of providing information that
05:36
can be used for decision making to reduce coastal hazards, so it’s been focused
05:40
on, very applied from the beginning.
05:44
I think the engineering background has a lot to do with that.
05:49
Did you teach while you were a grad student at OSU?
05:54
A little bit.
05:54
I TAed probably a little bit less than half the time I was a Ph.D. candidate
06:03
and I wouldn’t really call it teaching.
06:05
I would call it grading and running labs and things like that,
06:07
occasionally giving guest lectures.
06:09
I never taught a course and I think that was, again, the
06:15
circuitous route of my career.
06:17
I really didn’t have much of a desire to stay in academia after a Ph.D. I think
06:24
during the time that I was here I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do but when
06:27
I was given the opportunity to work at a state agency after I graduated that was
06:33
along the lines of applied work doing work that was ideally going to be used for
06:38
making decisions for coastal management.
06:40
That was the motivation here.
06:42
While I did have that TA experience there wasn’t a lot of
06:46
teaching involved at the time.
06:49
Your grad research was on model and coastal change, is that correct?
06:53
It was a little bit of that.
06:56
It was developing approaches to understand when erosion and
07:00
flooding hazards would occur.
07:03
We developed an approach to thinking about total water bubbles on the coast.
07:06
I actually did quite a bit of work measuring wave run-up on
07:12
the coast using video techniques.
07:14
Some of the first work looking at wave run-up on very high energy distributive
07:18
beaches that we have here in Oregon and I got involved in some really
07:22
neat experiments in the mid ‘90s to do that kind of work and then taking
07:27
empirical models that we developed from the observational work, put that
07:31
together with a fairly straightforward model that was able to predict how
07:35
often dunes or cliffs or backshore protection structures would be impacted
07:40
by high water levels at the coast.
07:43
Was that computer simulation modeling or mathematical?
07:47
It was pretty straightforward.
07:48
Just kind of—a little bit of math involved.
07:52
But I wouldn’t say it was very sophisticated at the time.
07:56
Was climate change already present in your mind at that point?
08:02
It was.
08:04
It was definitely present in our thinking, although I would say that at
08:08
the time mid to late ‘90s there weren’t a lot of very precise predictions,
08:15
projections of what the impacts would be.
08:17
I mean, people were thinking along the lines of sea level rise at the time, but
08:23
the whole thinking that we have today about how to adapt to different scenarios,
08:28
we were doing that kind of work back at the time, so we knew it was relevant to
08:32
think about how high the water levels were, and we knew we could simply add
08:36
some sea level rise projections to that.
08:38
For my thesis, we actually didn’t take that step.
08:41
I think it was thought of at the time as too unknown, too wildly
08:46
imprecise to really add to a scientific piece of work at that point.
08:51
In hindsight, it would have been probably a nice thing to do is to
08:54
add that climate change flavor to the work that we were doing at the time.
08:58
It turns out today my students are using very similar techniques.
09:03
It’s only conceptually similar.
09:04
It’s a lot more sophisticated.
09:06
But they’re adding climate change variabilities and projections
09:09
into that work, and I think they get a lot more out of it.
09:14
So, after school you went to work for the Washington Department of Ecology?
09:17
Yep, that’s correct.
09:18
What was that experience like transitioning, as you say to
09:21
an applied science setting?
09:24
It was great.
09:26
On the one hand, very exciting, lots of new opportunities.
09:30
It was also a little bit bizarre in the reason I was able to get a job at the
09:37
Washington Department of Ecology at the time is there was just beginning a major
09:44
new multi-year, multi-investigator study primarily funded by the U.S. Geological
09:48
Survey but also by the state of Washington that was focused on the beaches north
09:52
and south of the Columbia River, so in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.
09:57
That was the Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study.
10:02
When I was doing a Ph.D., finished my Ph.D., at AGU talks and thinks like that
10:07
had met some scientists from the USGS and they were the ones that were building this
10:12
study and they were able to connect me with a colleague, George Kaminsky, at the
10:17
Washington State Department of Ecology.
10:18
When he was hired in the late, maybe the early ‘90s he was
10:24
the primary coastal engineer for the entire state of Washington.
10:27
But his interests were primarily in the outer coast of the Washington
10:31
Coast and had seen that there was a lot of hot spot erosion occurring in
10:37
the mid to, I guess, the early to mid ‘90s and it was fairly unexplained.
10:42
The Washington coast hadn’t had a lot of studies done on it and part of that
10:49
because not many people live there or lived there at the time and also
10:52
because a lot of that coastline is actually building out fairly rapidly
10:55
with sediment from the Columbia River.
10:57
There was a lot of huge need to understand the typical details that
11:01
are usually pretty obvious, like which ways that longshore sediment is going.
11:05
I think at the time in the mid ‘90s we actually didn’t know
11:07
how to answer that question.
11:08
The USGS and the
11:12
state of Washington put their resources together and initiated starting in
11:17
’96, ’97 this pretty major study.
11:20
From the ability of a newly minted Ph.D. to get out of grad school and
11:25
land a situation like that to be able to develop a monitoring program for the
11:30
state of Washington that had data that had not been collected before, there
11:34
was a lot of newness and excitement, a lot of interesting and smart scientists
11:39
from around the country and even around the world were coming to this location
11:43
for meetings and things like that.
11:45
There was a lot of excitement.
11:46
It was also a little bit odd because we were trying to do coastal geomorphology
11:50
research in a state agency that was primary involved in managing
11:55
coastlines, not doing research.
11:56
We were a little bit of an odd ball entity.
11:58
We called ourselves the coastal mapping and analysis program sea map.
12:03
We were known as the mavericks in the agency.
12:07
I think I did a lot of things wrong in terms of purchasing new equipment.
12:11
I didn’t do a lot of things correctly from the agency’s perspective.
12:14
But at the same time, I was having a lot of fun and we started a beach monitoring
12:19
program in the summer of 1997 that this past summer, the summer of 2017, was the
12:26
end of the 20th year of that program.
12:28
It’s been really nice to watch a data set that I helped begin that
12:33
long ago continue to this day.
12:36
What are your impressions of it at this point now that it’s wrapped up, I guess
12:41
in terms of learning from that experience?
12:45
It sounds like you feel satisfied to some extent with it?
12:47
Yeah, the Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study was really a great, at
12:53
the time we called it interdisciplinary research and that’s because we had a
12:57
geologist and an engineer on the same team, where maybe someone that looked at
13:03
coastal processes.
13:03
Even today’s day and age we’d have to have a social scientist on
13:08
the team and an ecologist on the team to have it be thought of as
13:11
truly interdisciplinary research.
13:14
But it was a great study.
13:17
As I said because of the fact that there hadn’t been much done in Southwest
13:21
Washington in terms of understanding the history of those beaches and trying
13:24
to make projections of those beaches we had kind of this wide-open slate,
13:27
and I think we accomplished quite a bit, published quite a bit on it.
13:32
It was a very satisfying experience.
13:37
That said, the monitoring program is still going.
13:40
I’m still publishing and having students analyze data from work that we started
13:46
over about 20 years ago when I first went to the state of Washington, so
13:51
that’s been a lot of fun as well.
13:54
You mentioned USGS?
13:56
I saw that you’re a USGS Mendenhall Research Fellow?
13:59
[Nods]
13:59
. Did
14:02
that help fund part of this research, or is that a separate project?
14:06
It actually helped me continue on, but I also was able to branch out and
14:09
do a few other things at the time.
14:11
I worked for the state of Washington for about 4 ½ years or so.
14:14
I think the southwest Washington and coastal region study hadn’t ended yet
14:19
but it was kind of winding down and as I said before kind of being a research
14:24
first person at that state agency was a kind of an oddball thing and so I
14:29
was looking for other opportunities and the colleagues that I had been working
14:36
with from the USGS had this opportunity to go work as a postdoc in their group
14:41
for a couple of years and so that was sort of an easy transition to make.
14:46
I moved from Olympia, Washington to San Francisco and worked
14:50
in the Menlo Park office.
14:52
That was a Mendenhall postdoc for 2 years and then became a research geologist for
14:57
the USGS for about 3 years after that.
14:59
That was sort of my career trajectory, as I had decided that I was going to work
15:04
for the USGS instead of the state agency.
15:07
Still, academia was the furthest thing from my mind at the time.
15:11
Because of working with the same people and having the flexibility of that
15:15
Mendenhall those first couple of years that I was at the USGS, I was able to
15:20
work on southeast Washington data sets, continued to collect data in the summer,
15:25
published some more work on something that we’ve been working on for the last
15:28
several years, the previous several years.
15:30
It enabled me to continue to work on that quite a bit.
15:34
What was your impression of USGS as an agency to work for?
15:39
It was great.
15:40
I loved it.
15:41
My way in the door was as a Mendenhall postdoc and then I was lucky enough
15:46
to apply for and get a permanent track position as a research geologist there.
15:52
I’ve always said that in terms of coastal and marine geology groups around the
15:55
country if you put together there now in Santa Cruz—the west coast group.
16:01
There’s a St. Petersburg, Florida, group and a Woods Hole, Massachusetts
16:04
group, it’s kind of the biggest critical mass, the best coastal geologist
16:09
in the country, if not the world.
16:12
There put into those three groups but they all do work together.
16:15
So, there was a lot of great people to work with, typically resources to
16:19
do interesting work, and as I said, I have done a ton of work in my career in
16:25
Washington and Oregon, but when I was at the USGS I was able to work in a couple of
16:29
other places, like Alaska, North Carolina, and California obviously with the Sumatra
16:35
after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
16:40
So, had lots of great opportunities there.
16:42
It was a blast.
16:44
Can you talk a little bit more about that experience, going to Sumatra?
16:47
Sure, yeah, that was wild.
16:51
I’ve never really spent a lot of time focusing on tsunami
16:54
hazards as part of my career.
16:56
I focus on coastal hazards, but primarily chronic hazards which
17:01
are more the individual storms that occurred during normal winters in
17:06
the west coast and then El Niños and the sea level rise and changing
17:10
patterns and ETETET on top of that.
17:12
So, I’ve never been really focused on tsunamis, but I had several of
17:16
my colleagues at the USGS they had this approach where they would go
17:22
wherever in the world a major tsunami had occurred if it was big enough to
17:28
cause significant inundation and then lay down a sediment deposit on the
17:33
surface of a coastal plain, they would go and analyze that sediment deposit.
17:39
The idea was, and still is, is if you can say something based on the way the
17:44
sediments are laid down, in terms of how they are coarse and are fine in the
17:48
sediment column and the number of waves that caused them to be deposited—if you
17:54
can say something about the modern-day tsunami deposits, then you can look back
17:58
into paleo cores of old tsunamis and say more about them in terms of not just
18:06
the frequency of the events but also the magnitude and how devastating they might
18:12
have been.
18:12
Scientists have used around the world information in cores about sediments to
18:21
you know deduce basically, for example in Oregon in the Pacific Northwest
18:25
that we have these major Cascadia zone mega tsunamis and associated with that
18:35
there are these deposits laid down in the muds and the sands, etc. They were
18:40
able to determine the last even that we had was in 1700, and basically between
18:46
sediment analyses in the land as well as in the sea, can put together the
18:51
late whole scene history basically of how often these events actually happen.
18:57
But from those sediment deposits it’s been difficult to figure
19:00
out what the magnitude is.
19:02
The idea is if you study a modern-day tsunami, when we actually know a lot
19:06
more about the waves because we have some measurements or we have video,
19:09
have a lot of quick information about how high the water was based upon
19:13
markers on trees, high water lines, etc., then you can actually connect
19:19
the hydrodynamics that we know pretty well to this modern-day sediment despot
19:23
and then infer, based on the paleo
19:28
sediment deposits, what the hydrodynamics might have been with those paleo tsunamis.
19:33
It’s a very important piece of work.
19:36
All that said, I basically went as a field tech because this was not my main piece
19:40
of interest, but one of the things that I have done quite a bit of in my work on the
19:48
coast is collect near-shore bathymetry.
19:50
When I say near-shore bathometry I mean basically the underwater typography
19:55
of the coastline, kind of between the sub areal beach and then to deeper
20:00
water depths than what the beach is annual changing on a yearly basis.
20:04
We’ve developed techniques to do this with GPS and echo sounders on personal
20:10
watercrafts, basically jet skis.
20:11
I had done a lot of work measuring that bathometry in very shallow
20:15
environments, which is pretty much of a specialty 15, 20 years ago.
20:21
A lot of people do it now.
20:23
I was able to bring that technology with me a few months after the
20:28
Sumatra event, we went to in March
20:33
2005.
20:33
My job with the other USGS colleagues would go on land and they’d be out
20:39
there in 90-degree weather, baking on these coastal plains, digging
20:44
in the mud collecting sediment, I was on a small skiff you know just
20:48
bombing around the in the near shore collecting near show bathometry.
20:50
I had by far the best job.
20:54
It was actually really exciting, where we were able to collect evidence
20:58
of a sediment deposit underwater that had been laid by the tsunami
21:04
during its strong down phase.
21:05
One of the things that I’ve spent a lot of time studying is just typical sandbars
21:10
that are pretty much always underwater and they move around with storms and
21:14
waves and seasonally, but this deposit that we found that we mapped was in about
21:19
12 liters of water, which is much deeper than any normal sandbar was, and we mapped
21:25
it in the longshore about a kilometer or two, and we were pretty sure that it was a
21:32
kind of a temporary morphological feature that was developed by this tsunami.
21:37
But subsequent modeling efforts bore that out and we went back in
21:41
2007 to the same location, made the same kinds of measurements and
21:44
that deposit was no longer there.
21:46
That sediment had been distributed along the rest of the coastal shelf.
21:50
It was kind of a cool finding that I was part of, I was part of going
21:55
to Indonesia following that event.
21:59
It was exciting for other reasons, like getting shot at by the
22:02
military and things like that.
22:04
That’s a different story.
22:05
Wow, do you want to explain that further, or?
22:10
I don’t know the history in a huge amount of detail, but we were in the
22:16
northwest region of Sumatra, Banda Aceh, and that was an area that prior
22:20
to this event there had been a civil war for many years and there had been a
22:27
ceasefire for the immediate few months after that between the government-led
22:33
military and the GAM who were the rebels and I think we showed up around 3 ½
22:40
or so months after the event, after a lot of the lifesaving and immediate
22:44
emergency response was taken care of.
22:47
We came in to do the science, but I think at that time the
22:53
ceasefire was breaking down and there was distrust between
22:56
the rebels and the government.
22:58
We had rented a surf charter boat, and it was pretty rare for
23:03
such a nice boat to be this area.
23:04
This was an area where not a lot of westerners came pretty much ever.
23:10
Here we were in this surf charter boat and I had this very nice skiff that I was
23:14
collecting my near shore bathometry in and at one point there was a bunch of,
23:20
there was a group of military but they’re basically 17-year-old kind of Rambo loving
23:24
looking kids and they were on land and they were trying to get my attention but
23:29
I never noticed them and I think they were shooting these warning shots over
23:33
the boat and I kept on hearing what I thought was just the engine backfiring, so
23:37
I kept on stopping the boat and checking the engine and didn’t see anything wrong
23:41
and then my colleagues finally got me on the radio and said you got to stop.
23:45
The story they told me is the warning shots were angled like this and then
23:48
like this and then like this [shows hand vertically moving horizontally] . So,
23:53
we left the area after this event.
23:55
We went to an island off shore.
24:00
You’re in California working or USGS, what inspires you to return to academia?
24:07
Good question.
24:08
It was basically just a family decision at the time.
24:11
I had good job offers here.
24:15
Wasn’t really looking, but the opportunity to come back to Corvallis
24:20
came up and so I took the opportunity.
24:23
Were you happy to return to Oregon State in particular?
24:27
I was definitely happy to return to Corvallis and Oregon State
24:31
to some extent, although I left
24:35
a USGS kind of permanent position and started as a research faculty,
24:39
basically having to raise 9 months of my salary each year with grants
24:43
and so I panicked for the first three years that I was here trying to do
24:47
that, just trying to get my foothold.
24:50
I’m not sure how much I enjoyed the first couple years and how pleasant
24:54
it was to be back at OSU, but I had been gone for almost a decade, so
25:00
it was really nice to come back.
25:02
How did it feel being in CEOAS as opposed to civil, this time?
25:09
Well, actually at the time it wasn’t CEOAS.
25:11
I was in the geosciences department, which was still in the College of Science.
25:17
I worked closely with folks in COAS.
25:20
It was just the college of oceanography at the time, the
25:23
Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences.
25:26
The merger to bridge geosciences and COAS didn’t occur—that was
25:31
about 6 or 7 years ago now.
25:32
I had already been here for about 5 years.
25:37
Were there people important to helping you get settled in when you returned?
25:42
Yeah, absolutely.
25:43
I think many people made it possible and made it much smoother than it
25:49
would have been otherwise, and I owe them a huge amount of thanks.
25:53
Maybe first and foremost would be Rob Holman who was
25:55
somebody that I worked with.
25:57
He wasn’t my major advisor for my Ph.D., but he was somebody that I worked in
26:02
his lab and he was definitely a mentor for me, and so he I think pulled some
26:07
strings with deans and you know he did a lot of behind the scenes work to
26:11
help me get back here, which was great.
26:15
Then there was several other people, both in kind of oceanography as well
26:18
as in engineering, Tuba Ozkan-Haller and Mira Collar both helped a lot.
26:24
Dan Cox was great as well.
26:28
Dan actually gave me a part of a project he was already working on.
26:32
He was the director of the wave lab at that time and had a sea grant
26:36
project looking at dune erosion.
26:39
He offered me the ability to have a month or two of salary on that and
26:42
take over the design of what we’re going to do in terms of the experiment
26:45
and so without those kinds of initial
26:50
kindnesses by faculty here it would have been a much rougher go of it.
26:54
So, they were great.
26:55
It sounds like you still worked pretty closely with people in
26:58
the College of Engineering?
26:59
Yeah, that’s one thing we’ve always loved about doing coastal research
27:06
here at Oregon State, starting from the time that I was a student.
27:11
As I said I was in the coastal ocean engineering group at the time, but
27:16
actually my co-advisor was Paul Komar who was in Oceanography and I actually spent
27:21
a lot of time in Ron Holman’s lab, in his coastal imaging lab, and other students
27:26
that I had come in to OSU with, and the engineering program did the same thing.
27:32
We’ve always had this low disciplinary boundary between those
27:36
two groups and that’s maintained I think probably more so today.
27:42
I advise engineers now and I’m on the committees of students that
27:48
are advised by engineering faculty and vice versa and we all work
27:52
together and we’re all good friends.
27:54
It works out really well.
27:56
Did you teach when you first arrived?
28:00
Let’s see, I got here in almost a little bit less than 12 years ago,
28:06
and I think I probably didn’t have to teach for about 6 to 9 months.
28:09
I’m trying to think exactly how it was, but yes within a year I was teaching.
28:14
I was actually given the opportunity to design a couple of classes to
28:18
teach and so the first class I taught was a coastal geomorphology class
28:25
and actually that’s not true.
28:26
I taught the first term I was here, the spring term, but I kind of co-taught a
28:31
class that was already on the books that Rob Holman was teaching, and it was a,
28:36
we called it at the time beach processes and sedimentation or something like that.
28:41
It became nearshore sediment transport after teaching it
28:45
with Rob a couple of times.
28:46
Anyway, that was one of the things that I did when I first got here
28:49
was teach that class, but then in terms of classes that I developed,
28:52
I developed a coastal geomorphology and then eventually a coastal hazards
28:55
class which I alternate every year.
28:59
How do you perceive teaching since it sounds like you didn’t
29:02
initially anticipate returning to academia and becoming a teacher?
29:06
I was absolutely horrified.
29:09
I think that was part of the main reason why I never wanted to be an
29:11
academic, because I thought teaching would be too hard, too scary.
29:17
Just having to face students constantly.
29:19
I love it.
29:22
It’s a blast and it’s one of the best parts of the job.
29:25
But it’s a struggle because I have many people, NCOs, not all of us, but there’s
29:32
a lot of folks in our college that have jobs that are predominantly research
29:37
oriented and we still have to raise a good amount of money for our salary through
29:43
grants and our research programs, and so the teaching is always—trying to find
29:49
time for both and being successful at both is definitely a tricky thing but
29:54
it’s great to have the diversity and job.
29:56
But I teach about a class, a class and a half per year.
30:03
But I would say when I first got here and had to teach within a month
30:08
after showing up it was definitely a stressful part of the transition for me.
30:13
It sounds like there are a few elements of stress at that time.
30:18
Yeah, right.
30:19
You touched on the data gathering process, but I was wondering if maybe you could
30:23
elaborate a little more on how you gather data for your models and maybe how that
30:28
technology has changed through your career in terms of modeling beach morphology?
30:34
Yeah, great question.
30:38
It was interesting.
30:39
When I was in graduate school was around the time that GPS technology
30:45
was just becoming accurate enough and I won’t say cheap enough—only a
30:52
handful of groups could afford getting their hands on real-time kinematic GPS
30:57
that you can actually get that onto a few centimeters worth of accuracy,
31:01
the horizontal and the vertical.
31:03
I was lucky enough that when I was at OSU Rob Holman’s lab purchased equipment
31:08
like that and then started putting it on things like beach buggies and backpacks
31:13
and small boats in the nearshore.
31:17
I think as I was coming up starting to develop techniques that I wanted to
31:21
use, particularly when I went to the state of Washington and developed the
31:26
state’s beach monitoring program, this new technology was ripe to be exploited
31:31
for these different kinds of purposes.
31:33
I think that the thing that I contributed to was taking these techniques that
31:39
people were using for maybe focus field experiments to support hydrodynamic
31:44
measurements or maybe one or two study sites they started to repeat measurements
31:50
at, we tried to take the approach of we wanted to understand a region so this
31:55
area that the southwest Washington coast erosion study encompassed was about 160
32:00
kilometers of coastline from Tillamook at Oregon to Point Granville, Washington and
32:05
so we divined a beach change monitoring program that involved collecting
32:12
data throughout all four seasons.
32:15
It was very nested in the fact that we had some techniques that
32:18
we did high resolution everywhere.
32:22
Other techniques, because they were too time consuming or more
32:25
expensive or just physically more difficult, we only did occasionally
32:29
once a summer, that kind of thing.
32:31
But I would say that a lot of those techniques were
32:33
still using them in general.
32:37
It’s still real time kinematic GPS equipment with an onboard computer
32:42
and a single beam echo sounder.
32:44
All the components of that are several generations better.
32:49
They don’t break down as much.
32:51
The integration of it all is much better than it used to be.
32:56
We’re mapping things with high resolution and higher frequencies
33:00
and so the data sets have just become better and better and more precise.
33:03
But in general, the techniques that we started working with 20 years ago
33:07
it’s actually still fairly efficient to use those techniques as well.
33:12
That said, there are many other techniques that are being used and my group uses them
33:17
as well, but those GPS based techniques are still sort of the workhorse.
33:24
Once you have that equipment and made that investment it’s pretty
33:27
straightforward to go to the coastline, put a backpack on with a GPS unit and
33:32
walk a beach profile and you’re comparing to something that’s been collected
33:36
many dozens of times over the years.
33:38
That’s pretty nice.
33:39
I guess simple changes—we used to have this setup of very expensive
33:43
base station over a known monument.
33:45
We don’t have to do that anymore because there’s continuously operating
33:48
networks of stations that the states run, so we can just plug into that.
33:54
We can go to a new site, and not have to worry so much about geodetic control,
33:58
etc. So, things are a lot more efficient.
34:02
But you know there’s many new techniques, particularly remote sensing techniques.
34:08
My group has dabbled with using drones to collect beach change data and many
34:14
other groups are doing that with a lot more effort than we have, but that’s
34:19
how the technologies are changing and everything’s becoming cheaper and,
34:23
in some sense, easier to mobilize.
34:27
That said, using a drone to measure 160 kilometers of coastline, like the
34:33
southwest Washington coastal erosion study, I think I would still use a lot
34:37
of these techniques that we have been using for 20 years rather than the newer
34:40
technology because we can use them in all kinds of weather, you don’t need as much
34:44
permitting, you don’t have to ask for permissions, not a lot of planning goes
34:48
into it, but it’s still fairly expensive and fairly time extensive as well.
34:55
Is Lidar a useful tool for you?
34:58
Absolutely.
34:59
I didn’t mention it primarily because I’m not involved in the collection
35:04
of Lidar, but I certainly am a consumer and all of my students
35:08
have consumed and used Lidar data.
35:10
That’s been fantastic.
35:12
Again, I just take it for granted because I think it’s around that time
35:16
of the mid to late ‘90s is when Lidar came on because of the advent of these
35:22
GPS being useful and more affordable, so why not just throw it on an airplane
35:29
with a Lidar unit and then you’d get spatially located point clouds of data.
35:36
When I first went to the Washington Department of Ecology it was the summer
35:41
or spring of 1997 and that was the beginning of the major El Niño of ’97-’98.
35:49
One of the things that the USGS and NASA and NOA did was fly a good chunk
35:55
of the U.S. west coast in the fall of ’97 and then the spring of ’98 to
36:00
get a before and after shot of what the El Niño response was, and the
36:05
monitoring program that we set up was
36:09
to resolve that process as well but with a lot more time demand resolution,
36:16
because we did it much more frequently, but having Lidar in that sense it was
36:22
twice in a year, but it’s been every couple of years now for 20 years or so.
36:26
It’s fantastic.
36:28
We could start a new project, like I have a project now in North Carolina
36:31
on the outer banks and before to figure out the coastal evolution
36:38
of a system over the last couple of decades, if you didn’t have beach
36:41
profiles, you’d just rely on shoreline positions that might have been based on
36:47
interpretations of aerial photographs.
36:49
Now we have about a dozen Lidar data sets that have been collected in the
36:52
last couple of decades and so it’s not just analyzing one line of the
36:56
sand, it has a huge amount of variable and uncertainty associated with it.
36:59
We have the full beach profile, at least the subaerial beach profile.
37:03
All it takes is writing good enough code to extract the features that we care about
37:09
and mapping the morphological evolution.
37:12
It’s spectacular.
37:14
Can you talk about your research on the outer banks?
37:18
Sure, that’s a very cool collaboration.
37:22
It’s truly interdisciplinary work, because there’s an ecologist on the team,
37:25
many ecologists on the team, actually.
37:29
It’s work that I’m doing with Sally Hacker’s group here.
37:35
She’s in the integrative biology group.
37:38
We have a colleague in the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Laura Moore,
37:42
who’s also a coastal geomorphologist.
37:46
Basically, all three of our groups are interested in sand dunes.
37:49
I’m interested in all kinds of different parts of coastal geomorphology but
37:55
recently there’s been a lot of work focused on sand dunes, and the general
38:00
idea is that we’ve noticed in many systems, and Sally and I have worked on
38:06
this extensively in the Pacific Northwest that the shape of the dune and how dunes
38:13
are formed through time is often dependent upon the grasses that grow on them.
38:18
It’s a function of how the grasses trap sand and they have different
38:23
efficiencies in terms of how they trap sand, and then how the grasses themselves
38:27
respond to being buried by sand.
38:29
This very cool ecomorphodynamic feedback of sand blowing up the beach, being
38:35
trapped by these grasses that are salt tolerant and burial tolerant, on
38:41
the coastline and different grasses have these differing growth habits.
38:48
So, this feedback plays out.
38:50
So, different species result in differently shaped dunes.
38:53
We’ve seen that on the west coast and the idea was to go to North Carolina
38:57
and test some of those hypotheses.
38:58
There’s different grass species there.
39:00
It’s very different kinds of systems and try to understand the role of
39:06
grass in terms of building dunes and how beaches and dunes recover
39:11
following storms and how the role of the grass is involved in that recovery.
39:17
Coastal sand dunes are the primary line of defense for high water levels
39:23
and flooding during big storms, etc., so having a significant backshore
39:29
elevation that is a sand dune prevents the backshore, whether it’s an ecosystem
39:33
or infrastructure from being flooded.
39:36
Understanding the details of the processes involved in the recovery after events and
39:41
just dune building itself is pretty key.
39:44
That’s the work that we’re doing there.
39:47
Would you say there are beneficial aspects, from what I understand, on
39:53
the Oregon coast of non-native grass species restrict dune growth or movement?
39:59
But it sounds like there’s a benefit to that from humans living on the coast?
40:04
Yeah.
40:05
That’s a very interesting almost dilemma in terms of the tradeoffs.
40:11
We call these ecosystem services.
40:14
These grasses are ecosystems engineers and the way they help shape the
40:18
geomorphology of the coastline provides a variety of services, and
40:22
you can think of that in services to humans or things that we value.
40:27
One of which, a pretty important one, and you asked about my engineering background
40:31
earlier, I’ve been interested in coastal protection as a service for a long time.
40:38
As I was just saying, the higher the sand dune the more you’re protected from
40:42
high water levels during flooding events.
40:44
That’s often a very good thing.
40:46
If I have a development and I want to be protected from high
40:50
waters I want a sand dune.
40:53
There’s lots of tradeoffs there.
40:54
In fact, these invasive species that pretty much now dominate the majority
41:00
of sand dunes throughout Oregon and Washington they were brought in kind
41:05
of these early infrastructure projects.
41:09
People were building along the coast, trying to build communities
41:12
and roads and transportation routes and a lot of the coastal sand dunes,
41:19
sand was blowing all over the place.
41:21
They were not very stabilized.
41:23
The native grass species is a good sand trapper, but the way it grows it kind of
41:28
grows in clumps and it forms very hummocky three-dimensional dunes and it’s easy
41:33
for sand to blow through and around it.
41:36
So, people that were trying to establish communities were constantly fighting
41:40
against getting buried by sand and having roads getting buried by sand, and so they
41:45
on purpose brought in an invasive species.
41:49
First it was this European beach grass that is a great sand binder
41:54
and it’s been known to build big foredunes all over the world.
41:58
A few decades later another invasive species in American beach grass came
42:02
in and basically, they did their job.
42:05
They were able to trap a lot of the sediment, build significant foredunes,
42:09
and so really the whole shape of coastal foredunes along the Oregon
42:14
and Washington coast is completely different now than it was prior to
42:18
these invasive species coming in.
42:21
As I said, they did their job.
42:23
They were brought in to trap that sediment and it did that.
42:27
We have fairly stable communities now, only a few places where sand
42:32
blows into homes and onto streets.
42:35
That’s still a problem in some places, but there’s a huge number of potential
42:39
negative side effects to that, and one is many species of plants and
42:45
animals are negatively impacted by having those big, tall foredunes.
42:50
A lot of Sally’s work has been focused on this.
42:55
The most famous one is the snowy plover, which is an endangered species, that
43:00
prefers habitat, prefers the habitat of that open, low-lying coastal dune.
43:05
They make their nests in the high beach backshore area.
43:12
Just an indentation in the sand but they don’t like having these big,
43:17
tall dunes because it’s more easy for predators to get to them, so
43:23
their numbers have declined significantly.
43:25
There’s been a lot of programs in restoring sand dunes more
43:29
toward the actual state, which is basically cutting down the dune,
43:32
removing that invasive beach grass, some plantings of native species.
43:36
That’s one example of a species that did really poorly after the invasives came in.
43:43
Pink sand verbena is another species that has done very poorly as well.
43:48
There’s several others.
43:50
So, from an ecological perspective, there’s been a negative impact.
43:55
The other potential impact that’s maybe harder to think about for people to live
44:00
here in the valley, but if you have a home that part of your value for your home is
44:08
looking out over the beach and the water and if that dune keeps growing taller and
44:12
taller and eventually you can’t actually see the water and the beach through this
44:17
dune rapidly because it’s a high sediment load and these species of grasses that
44:23
build tall dunes, then that’s a negative potential impact as well for some people.
44:28
There’s a lot of these different trade-offs in
44:32
terms of ecosystem services that revolve around this dune problem.
44:39
Can you talk about the Envision Project in Tillamook?
44:41
Sure.
44:42
That’s a very exciting project.
44:45
We’ve actually done a couple of these projects now where we finished
44:51
working in Tillamook a couple of years ago and have been working in
44:54
Grace Harbor County in Washington and are finishing that project now.
44:58
This is a
45:02
little bit of a departure from a lot of work that I’ve done in
45:04
terms of this work has been very much stakeholder driven science.
45:09
I said in the beginning that I’ve always thought of myself of being very applied
45:13
and use inspired work, but I think over the years I’ve realized that I was doing
45:22
science in the traditional way in terms of writing reports and peer reviewed
45:27
articles and hoping it was going to be used by decision makers, even when I
45:32
worked for the state of Washington, that was the Coastal Management Agency for
45:34
the state of Washington, I don’t think a lot of the work that I was doing was
45:37
actually being—it was useful, basically.
45:42
I could say it was the decision makers’ fault, but it was actually my fault
45:46
in terms of not asking them the right questions, not figuring out what form
45:50
to put the data and the results in and so this work has been from the very
45:57
beginning tried to be very stakeholder driven and the way we describe it is it’s
46:04
a process of coproduction of knowledge.
46:06
So, we started several years ago in Tillamook County.
46:12
It’s an area that as far as the Oregon coast goes, it’s primarily dune backed,
46:18
although there are several areas that have significant erosion problems
46:22
that have been faced with putting in engineering structures to protect
46:26
their backshore, because the dunes were getting eroded and getting overtopped.
46:32
In areas that were eligible to put our engineering
46:35
structures they were doing that.
46:38
The county in general, but a couple of communities, in particular Neskowin,
46:42
had been really grappling with the options of dealing with coastal erosion,
46:47
coastal flooding both in today’s climate but also thinking everything
46:52
we hear this might be getting worse if sea levels rise and storms patterns
46:57
are continuing to maybe evolve.
47:00
We had a ripe group of stakeholders to get together with and talk through
47:05
what their values were, what kinds of things they enjoyed about the coastline,
47:12
and the problems as they saw them now and thinking through if things were
47:18
perfect how would this coastline look in 20-30 years and how can we get there?
47:23
What kind of adaptation strategies might get us to that point?
47:27
If you can imagine different people, whether they’re agencies or
47:31
government officials or just local citizens or working from NGOs, will
47:35
have different perspectives on that.
47:38
The Envision Project have allowed us to develop a series of adaptation
47:45
strategies or call them policy scenario narrative in terms of groupings of
47:52
different ideas of strategies to deal with coastal erosion, coastal
47:56
flooding, and then to evaluate them quantitatively in a model called Envision.
48:01
You refer to the Envision Project and we have different names for these
48:05
projects, but Envisioning Alternative Futures is one way we refer to it.
48:11
Envision is a modeling tool that was developed and overseen by John Bolte’s
48:16
group in the biological and ecological engineering program and it’s basically
48:23
a GIS based scenario analysis tool.
48:28
It’s very spatially explicit.
48:29
We can get down to the scale of individual tax lots mapped out in this modeling tool.
48:38
We know where all the existing infrastructure is and road networks.
48:42
We use Lidar data as the digital elevation model and knowing all kinds of information
48:48
about the beach slope and the dune heights and things like that that are
48:52
relevant for coastal change modeling.
48:55
When we started this project in Tillamook County, we were developing these scenarios
49:03
and strategies with stakeholders about what they thought they wanted the coast
49:07
to look like in a couple of decades, these different alternatives in terms of getting
49:11
there, so those are things like continuing to armor, to protect infrastructure.
49:17
Another way of thinking about the world would be to work with nature and to move
49:21
away from the coast, so potentially if you figure out where the money would
49:25
come from developing easement, such that if an area is getting impacted by
49:29
hazards on a repetitive basis, instead of defending the infrastructure, moving
49:33
that infrastructure back out of harm’s way and no new development would be built
49:38
within a hazard done and be quantified in a variety of different manners.
49:42
The nice thing about the Envision tool is it allows you to play these
49:45
games, basically, to develop these quantitative alternative futures.
49:51
As I said, all of the initial strategies came from our discussions
49:54
with stakeholders and these are county commissioners, these are planning
49:58
directors of the county, planning commission members, mayors of individual
50:02
towns and then just interested citizens, and motivated citizens.
50:08
We wound up modeling I think six individual sets of scenarios and each
50:11
one of those scenarios has anywhere between a handful to a dozen of
50:17
individual policies that are implemented.
50:19
At the base, we spent a lot of time at the end of the first year or two implementing
50:24
fairly straightforward coastal hazard models into Envision and Envision had
50:30
never been applied to the coast before.
50:31
It had been used in other environments, like forests and
50:34
streams and things like that.
50:36
But it’s very sectoral independent.
50:39
It can be applied anywhere, just the idea is to think through different scenarios
50:45
to get a group of stakeholders to think what alternative futures might look like.
50:51
We developed this approach on these relatively simple coastal
50:55
hazards model, basically quantifying flooding, quantifying erosion
51:00
and then developed a whole series of metrics, basically measuring sticks,
51:03
which the stakeholders can say ah, this is how well I’m getting towards my goal
51:09
of wanting to have less structures being impacted by flooding but still a wide
51:15
beach that I can walk and recreate on.
51:18
We had to figure out ways to actually get to that point and what kind of
51:20
policies would need to be implemented.
51:22
If you’re going to reduce infrastructure damage, you either have to build up
51:28
a dune or armor it, but to keep the beach wide under sea level rise,
51:32
you’d also have to nourish the beach.
51:34
That means keeping track of the volumes that would get deposited out there
51:39
and then potentially something about the cost of those actions as well.
51:43
Doing this at the county basis we were able to see this is how much it would
51:49
cost in what these different metrics that people were interested in, like
51:52
beach accessibility, reduction in negative hazards for this particular
51:57
scenario versus there was a scenario called hold the line, which as you can
52:03
imagine was protecting infrastructure, but they also wanted to keep the beach.
52:07
Then another scenario called the real line, which was
52:09
moving back as sea level rose.
52:11
I say as sea level rose, we implemented a series of sea level rise
52:17
scenarios in this project as well.
52:20
You can really by looking at the same metrics across these different
52:23
scenarios you can compare and contrast if we implemented these
52:28
strategies what it would look like.
52:32
The quantitative numbers are not terribly precise.
52:35
We can map at the tax lot level but really the idea is to get a
52:39
general sense, kind of community to community and county as a whole.
52:43
But it’s an incredibly powerful approach for a community that is starting,
52:48
they’re grappling with problems.
52:50
They’re trying to think through how to save individual properties but
52:53
also what’s going to happen to this entire county under different scenarios
52:59
to actually develop a quantitative tool, you can develop time series,
53:04
you can develop visualizations.
53:06
People can actually see the impact that human decision making
53:09
might have on the landscape.
53:11
It really helps people think through the impacts of their actions.
53:17
It’s very exciting work.
53:20
How did working with a local Oregon county compare to working with a local
53:27
Washington government organization?
53:32
You mean when I was working back for the Washington Department of Ecology?
53:35
Or this new work with Grace Harbor?
53:37
The Grace Harbor, right.
53:38
Well, there’s been a lot of similarities and a lot of differences
53:42
as part of the two projects.
53:43
In fact, I just a student of mine defended her masters about a week
53:48
ago that her analysis was comparing and contrasting these two approaches.
53:53
I think originally, we maybe went into it with a hypothesis thinking they’re
53:58
only separated by a couple hundred miles.
54:01
More or less the storm and water level forcing is similar.
54:06
The geomorphology is not terribly different between the two places.
54:10
We were going to invite the same people, you know, as I said county commissioners,
54:15
mayors, planning directors, city engineers, those kinds of folk and
54:21
more or less the same types came to both of these different projects, the
54:26
meetings of the different projects.
54:27
But there were a lot of differences.
54:29
I think it reflects that each location has their own set of values.
54:34
Some of it’s just the vague reason of who comes to the meeting and who speaks
54:37
up, but I think one thing that happened in Grace Harbor County is we spent a
54:42
lot more time focused on ecosystems and maintaining viable habitat for a
54:48
variety of species and part of that was probably because we also worked
54:53
in the actual bay Grace Harbor itself.
54:56
Whereas in Tillamook the project we really set up from the beginning because
54:59
it was our first time bringing Envision to an outer coast location, we’re just
55:03
going to look at the outer coast issues and we didn’t look at the Tillamook Bay.
55:06
I think that might have been part of the reason why there’s some
55:09
differences between the projects.
55:11
I think there were a handful of similarities but also a sobering number
55:18
of differences that made us realize that just scaling this project up we can’t
55:22
take the same 5 or 6 scenarios that we developed for Tillamook and run them for
55:27
the rest of the Pacific Northwest and say we’ve really answered the problems
55:31
involved in different stakeholders.
55:33
To do this well, and I think that’s just in general for any kind of science
55:38
that is coproduced with stakeholders, you have to go through a long and
55:42
involved process, multiple meetings.
55:46
It’s obviously harder to go to Grace Harbor on a regular basis than it is
55:49
to go to Tillamook because it’s a lot closer to us, webinars, etc., staying
55:56
in touch with the stakeholders is just less efficient when they’re further away.
56:00
We have less connections with different folks.
56:03
But both projects have been incredibly rewarding.
56:05
We’re not quite done.
56:06
We still have a few months left to finish up the Grace Harbor
56:09
work, but it’s been very exciting.
56:13
What was your experience like communicating scientific
56:15
information to nonscientists?
56:20
I would say it was great.
56:21
I thought I did a very good job, but every time we came back from a
56:24
meeting my students would tell me I talked too long, way too many plots.
56:29
They didn’t need to hear half of that information.
56:32
So,
56:34
I think I’ve learned throughout the years of doing this that you know less
56:40
is more and getting the group to talk is most important in these exercises.
56:49
Invariably the students give the best presentations and the
56:52
most well-received at these stakeholder meetings that we have.
56:57
But I mean to truly answer your question, the Grace Harbor work has
57:01
been funded by NOA but through the Climate Impacts Research Consortium,
57:07
which is a group that its home is here in Corvallis at OSU, but it’s a group
57:14
of research from all of the region and its part of an NOA program called RISA.
57:20
That whole program is really about coproducing knowledge, climate service
57:25
knowledge in a variety of different sectors, etc. I’ve had lots of mentoring
57:32
and lots of discussions about how to do this science communication.
57:38
I feel like I’m getting better, but I was telling the truth the students
57:42
that have come up realizing this they focus more on, they understand the
57:49
necessity to be able to communicate your science well, and so I’ve done my
57:54
best, but I’ve got a long way to go.
57:56
It’s a blast.
57:58
It’s interesting, but it takes a lot of time as well.
58:01
It takes things that I sort of take for granted in terms of a science talk that
58:08
I’ll give at a typical meeting that I would attend with my work colleagues, I
58:12
have to take a very different approach ad that takes a lot of time to prepare.
58:16
You talk about the same material but from a stakeholder group to an AGU
58:22
audience it’s a very different set of slides, etc. But it’s gratifying.
58:32
How has your research
58:35
working on it sounds like longer timescales affected your perspective
58:39
on human caused climate change?
58:44
I’m not sure how it’s affected my perspective, but I think
58:51
these Envisioning alternative futures projects, the fact that we’re
58:55
actually looking at multiple decades.
58:58
We typically run the simulations out to the end of the century, even though by
59:02
that point our ability to have any real certainty in terms of the projections
59:08
is basically nothing, but what it does it allows us to see these end number
59:13
differences between these scenarios.
59:15
What I was referring to earlier,
59:18
we have a scenario that might be hold the line, protect infrastructure;
59:22
a scenario that is more about protecting ecosystems and habitat,
59:27
etc.; and that’s very different.
59:30
If you’re starting to look at the metrics, number of homes impacted by
59:34
erosion, how accessible the beach is, whether it’s razor clam habitat, after
59:39
a decade or two you can’t see a lot of differences between the metrics, but when
59:44
you play it out for longer timescales you start to really see these differences.
59:51
Okay.
59:52
So, I think now I’ll move to the final set of broader climate change questions.
59:57
Sure.
59:59
What were your earlier conversations on climate change like and
1:00:01
have they shifted over time?
1:00:07
I’m trying to remember my earliest conversations.
1:00:09
I think probably the earliest conversations when I was in graduate
1:00:15
school starting to study coastal processes and hearing about sea level
1:00:19
rise projections and knowing that they were going to cause impacts to
1:00:28
coastal communities and so the work that I was doing was relevant from that
1:00:32
perspective, but I don’t think I truly made the connection even 25 years ago as
1:00:37
a student how much climate change would drive what I wound up doing eventually.
1:00:46
By no means was I a pioneer in terms of bringing climate
1:00:51
change impacts into my work.
1:00:53
But I think I did finally get it when I was working for the state agency,
1:00:57
the state of Washington, and seeing the problems that people in Washington were
1:01:02
dealing with and I think we at the time were convinced that the vast majority of
1:01:09
the erosion problems were being driven by sediment budget issues and you know
1:01:13
changing patterns of sediment delivery from Columbia, sediment being trapped
1:01:19
behind dams, and sediment not getting out to the coast during floods because
1:01:23
of flood control work of the Columbia.
1:01:28
But, seeing the
1:01:32
variability of coastal change as driven by kind of a mild winter
1:01:37
season versus a strong winter season and then in particular El Niños.
1:01:40
The first winter as I said that I went to the state of Washington was this
1:01:45
very major El Niño season, ’97-’98, was one of the top 3 El Niños that
1:01:50
we have had in the last many decades.
1:01:53
I think originally, I was most focused on climate variability and
1:01:57
then the climate change issues are easily added to the work that I was
1:02:04
already doing thinking about climate
1:02:09
variability.
1:02:09
Can you speak about the community of climate change researchers here at OSU
1:02:13
and maybe how the institution helps facilitate that collaborative research?
1:02:19
Yeah, it’s rich and deep and interconnected and I probably
1:02:24
know a small percentage of people here working on climate change.
1:02:28
I think that there’s a very, very large number of folks where
1:02:32
their work is somehow guided influence by climate change.
1:02:39
I think my major connection has been through this Climate Impacts Research
1:02:44
Consortium, so that’s one of the groups that Phil Motes is the PI on.
1:02:50
Phil's been good enough—we’ve actually known each other from the days that he
1:02:55
was still in Washington and I was at the Washington Department of Ecology.
1:02:58
When he got here and started building OCCRI and getting some of these early
1:03:02
proposals, even though I was not a funded member of CIRC when it started, he knew
1:03:07
that coastal impacts as driven by climate change would be an issue for the region
1:03:15
and he brought me on and I was able to leverage some of my existing work with
1:03:20
what CIRC was interested in and vice versa, so I’ve become a PI in that group.
1:03:28
I think from my perspective, and the connections that I have to climate
1:03:34
enterprise on campus, it’s been mostly about impacts rather than fundamental
1:03:40
drivers of global climate change, and so I’ve always been more interested—again
1:03:45
back to this applied theme—with what are the impacts at the coastline and I’ve
1:03:49
taken typically a regional perspective, but that could mean the whole west
1:03:53
coast or it could be one particular beach depending upon the study and so
1:04:02
there’s a whole bunch of different people at OSU to draw on in terms of
1:04:07
resources, models, et cetera, and so it’s a very rich experience working
1:04:13
on climate change issues here at OSU.
1:04:16
Are you concerned about funding cuts to researching climate change given
1:04:20
the current administration and if so how do you anticipate coping with that?
1:04:26
That’s a great question.
1:04:28
Yeah, so I’m definitely concerned.
1:04:29
Certainly, the first couple of draft budgets that came out in the beginning
1:04:33
of the year, I’d say the vast majority of programs that have historically been
1:04:37
funded were just zeroed out completely and that’s things have evolved, and
1:04:43
they are continuing to evolve, so
1:04:47
I think there’s definitely concern.
1:04:50
In terms of coping, I think it’s, I stick with what I know, and its
1:04:55
coastal impacts due to climate change and climate variability.
1:04:59
The fact of the matter is, is that coastal communities are dealing with
1:05:01
issues of flooding and erosion and are having to think through how to deal
1:05:06
with that today and whether or not it’s their government officials are thinking
1:05:14
that it’s climate change induced, these problems are not going away.
1:05:17
Water levels are changing.
1:05:19
Storm patterns are changing.
1:05:22
Kind of stick with that approach and have a diverse funding portfolio, ideally.
1:05:28
I can imagine being a primarily soft money funded researcher, that’s
1:05:34
definitely a concerning situation.
1:05:39
Alright.
1:05:39
What kind of policy changes would you like to see happen in the
1:05:42
U.S. based on your experience?
1:05:45
Well, I mean again I’ll stick to the thing that I focus on in terms of
1:05:49
policy and coastal policy in the region.
1:05:55
One nice thing about the U.S. is that they never tried to have a one size
1:05:59
fits all coastal management policy.
1:06:02
Each state basically makes their own sets of rules and policies and I think
1:06:07
for the most part that’s actually a pretty good thing because of the
1:06:10
diversity of issues and the diversity of geomorphology, diversity of foresting.
1:06:14
We’re not the Netherlands that is fairly finite and it’s easier to have a
1:06:18
national policy from that perspective.
1:06:21
Of course, having state by state and community by community differences
1:06:26
also has a lot of problems, but
1:06:32
maybe not answer this in terms of policies that need to be implemented
1:06:34
but I think the state of Oregon, the state of Washington and California as
1:06:39
well are going to have to think through if they had existing rules on the books
1:06:44
about who can and cannot defend their property with engineering solutions
1:06:50
that that’s going to cause a problem for the states and the people that
1:06:54
are on the can’t side of that ledger, if once the water level comes up high
1:07:01
enough that those properties are having significant impacts those people are
1:07:06
going to want to do something about it.
1:07:07
That’s just human nature.
1:07:09
Unless a policy is implemented that allows for the buying out of properties and
1:07:15
easements to be something that happens on a regular basis to move those properties
1:07:18
back, which is going to cost a significant amount of money, and that’s kind of the
1:07:22
thing that there’s very rarely political will to do, then the state’s going to have
1:07:27
to grapple with well what are we going to do when these people sue us for not
1:07:31
allowing them to protect their property?
1:07:34
They’ll assume it’s a takings kind of issue.
1:07:38
I’m not presuming which policies should be implemented, I’m just
1:07:41
saying the states need to be thinking about that now, because it happens
1:07:45
on a case by case basis each winter during a major El Niño nowadays.
1:07:50
But in a couple decades it’s going to happen on a much more frequent basis.
1:07:54
A couple of high-profile lawsuits might cause significant
1:07:57
changes to coastal policy.
1:08:00
In the past, Oregon’s coastal policy’s been fairly robust in terms of holding
1:08:05
up against those kinds of demands, but we’ll see what happens in the future.
1:08:10
But I think having a better idea about when and where those issues
1:08:14
are going to arise is important work that needs to happen right now.
1:08:18
The more the state does about it, the better.
1:08:23
What changes to public education do you think could help Americans
1:08:27
better understand climate change or change their behavior?
1:08:34
Yeah, that’s a great question.
1:08:36
I think one thing that we have noticed as part of the work that we’ve done
1:08:42
with these Envision projects is that when you’re examining the role of these
1:08:48
different adaptation strategies versus the range of possible climate change
1:08:53
impacts, so from a modest sea level rise to a very significant meter-plus sea
1:08:59
level rise by the end of the century, was very surprised that the human
1:09:04
adaptations, the human decision making actually makes a significant difference.
1:09:07
In some case, governs the variability of the things that we care about
1:09:13
in a couple of decades more so than the variability in climate scenario.
1:09:16
Basically, what that means is humans have the efficacy to do something
1:09:21
that is going to case a significant difference in the future in terms
1:09:25
of protecting coastlines or keeping infrastructure out of harm’s way.
1:09:30
I think maybe getting that kind of information out to different levels.
1:09:35
Obviously, I teach that in my classes at the university, but those are messages
1:09:39
that get down to high schools and K-8 programs easily as well that we have
1:09:45
the ability to make decisions at a whole bunch of different scales, my
1:09:49
experience is in terms of this coastal adaptation stuff, but I think that’s
1:09:53
probably true in many sectors, that climate change is not the gloom and doom,
1:10:00
the whole world’s going to hell in a handbasket because the sea level’s rising,
1:10:04
there’s nothing we can do about it.
1:10:05
We actually can do some things about it and we can potentially you know
1:10:09
whether that’s protecting some of the structure for the time being but also
1:10:14
keeping track of any potential negative impacts on ecosystems and if there are
1:10:18
negative impacts mitigating against those.
1:10:21
I think those messages can easily be gotten across in a more extensive manner.
1:10:27
That kind of leads into my final question—are you hopeful about
1:10:31
the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
1:10:35
In the context of climate change—I’d say yes and no.
1:10:40
I think the policies and the pulling out of the Paris Accord, the things that have
1:10:50
happened in the last year or so make me less hopeful because we’re losing time
1:10:54
in terms of largescale mitigation that can slow done some of these things, but
1:10:58
I’m also a relatively optimistic person and I do think that technology will
1:11:05
help us in some aspects of this problem.
1:11:08
I also think humans will use their ingenuity to adapt to
1:11:12
the situation as necessary.
1:11:14
I’d like to contribute to that being a fairly level of adaptation.
1:11:18
But yes, I have 3 kids and I’d better be hopeful for their sake,
1:11:24
so I’m relatively optimistic.
1:11:28
Well, on that note that concludes our interview.
1:11:30
Thank you for participating.
1:11:31
Great.
1:11:32
Thanks for having me.
1:11:34
I appreciate your time.
