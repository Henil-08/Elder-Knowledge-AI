00:02
Today is March.
00:02
22nd, 2018.
00:05
I’m here at the Valley Public Library with Jason Hanauska, an environmental
00:09
engineering students at OSU.
00:13
And today, we’re going to talk about climate change and his
00:16
academic career at Oregon State.
00:18
But first, I’d like to start with your background.
00:21
Where were you born?
00:22
I was born in Salem, Oregon.
00:24
Is that where you grew up?
00:26
Yes, born and-raised.
00:27
What do your parents do?
00:29
My mom is a nurse.
00:30
Well, she was a nurse with the Salem Hospital for about 30 years.
00:34
She’s since gone into private practice.
00:36
And my dad worked in
00:40
IT.
00:40
What were your interests growing up?
00:42
Did you have an early interest in science or engineering as a kid?
00:46
Honestly, no.
00:47
I had a pretty playful childhood and that lasted all the way
00:52
through high school, really.
00:54
I was involved in sports a lot.
00:57
And it wasn’t really until after high school that I started to get involved.
01:01
I
01:03
knew that community college was gonna be the way to go—didn’t
01:06
know what I wanted to do.
01:08
And it was once I took an environmental science class at community college that
01:13
really brought opened my eyes to all the things that were wrong with the world.
01:18
And I figured engineering was a really good way to go about that.
01:22
But as far as education, I didn’t really take school seriously until
01:28
half way through community college.
01:30
So once I did, it just hit like a train.
01:33
I couldn’t stop and I really enjoy going to school, and
01:36
learning as much as I could.
01:38
Did you spend time outdoors as a kid, or did your family?
01:42
Yes.
01:44
Not as much as nature-y outdoors.
01:48
But I was put on a motorcycle when I was about 4 years old.
01:53
And that been a steady part of my life ever since.
01:57
We had a spot at the sand dunes we went to every year, riding karts and doom buggies.
02:02
And the other half of the year, we’d be at the mountains where we’d be
02:07
a Mt. Bachelor or Mt. Hood Meadows.
02:10
And I started skiing, I think, around the same year that I was put on a motorcycle.
02:13
So I spent plenty of time outdoors.
02:19
Did you play any musical instrument growing up?
02:23
I did, not by choice.
02:26
Fifth grade, I think, is when I started playing trumpet.
02:29
My brother actually started it before me.
02:31
And he was the one that kept the train going with that.
02:36
I tried to get out of the for, probably, the first four years.
02:39
I really didn’t enjoy playing at all.
02:42
And then
02:45
my brother stepped up to the next league of marching band
02:49
which is called drum corps.
02:51
It’s
02:54
a professional discipline of music, essentially.
02:57
So that really inspired me the first time I saw one of those shows.
02:59
It was incredible.
03:01
So I hopped into that my freshman year of high school.
03:07
I spent an entire 3 months doing that over the summer and it was incredible.
03:12
It was hard work, 14 hours a day, playing a musical instrument.
03:17
And you’d do physical training.
03:20
It was one of the most physically and mentally demanding things I’ve ever done.
03:24
And that translated really well with school, as far as the process of
03:28
learning and the process of getting better and performing as well.
03:33
There’s nothing better than that.
03:34
So I still play a musical instrument.
03:36
I play it at the campus band, which is like your no-audition band here on campus.
03:44
But it’s great fun.
03:45
And it’s been a really cool part of my life.
03:48
How does drum corps differ from, say, a traditional high school band?
03:55
Well, you pay to do it.
03:59
[Laughs] It’s a professional organization.
04:01
But it’s not very well funded by anything other than the members.
04:05
So you’d pay do it.
04:07
Most of them, you’d audition to get in.
04:09
And then you’d spend probably 6 months during the winter.
04:13
You’d learn the material and you’d learn how to gel as an ensemble.
04:19
And then once everybody gets out of school—cause the age
04:25
is limited, it’s age 16-21 so once everyone gets out of school—usually
04:33
June, is when we do what football players might know as two-a-days.
04:38
We call ‘em all-days where you go and you stay in a gym for 2 weeks and for
04:43
about 14 hours a day, you rehearse.
04:45
You’d get some time off for food and a little bit of rest.
04:50
But it’s basically 4-hour blocks, times a day.
04:54
And it’s really intense.
04:57
So, after you have those first all-days where you get good and
05:01
you really learn your program, then you go and travel and compete.
05:05
There are regionals all over the United States.
05:09
There’s actually global league now.
05:10
But the one that I was in is
05:14
a national one.
05:15
So we’d travel.
05:16
We’d usually start in the Northwest, somewhere in Seattle.
05:18
And then we’d trip all the way to the East Coast, do a couple shows
05:24
in like Wisconsin and or New York.
05:27
And then we’d basically just do a rim around the entire United State, and
05:30
then end up for the finalist competition which is now, I think, in Indianapolis.
05:35
So yeah, it’s much more competitive and much more devoted than a high school band.
05:43
And if anybody gets a chance to see drum corps show, it’s incredible.
05:46
It’s the loudest thing you’ve ever heard.
05:48
And it’s also the most visually and musically stimulating thing.
05:51
It’s really cool.
05:53
What was it like travelling around the US as a part of drum
05:57
corps at that point of your life?
06:02
It was really eye-opening.
06:05
Up until this year, I had never been out of the country.
06:09
And I’ve pretty much just gone to California and Washington,
06:12
cause I grew up in Oregon.
06:16
Granted, we did a lot of travelling, but we really didn’t get to see much
06:21
more than just gym floors and stadiums.
06:24
But it was just the environment of being around a group of
06:29
people that become your family.
06:33
And you go through some really terrible times, and you go
06:37
through some really cool times.
06:38
So I think that just that sense of family would probably stuck with me
06:43
more than anything from traveling.
06:45
Because it’s not like travelling like if you were to go on a road trip.
06:50
On a road trip, you’re making the choices, “what’re we gonna do this day, how are we
06:55
gonna eat, how are we gonna pay for this.” But with drum corps, everything is all
06:59
set in stone. There’s a whole organization that provides food and provides lodging.
07:05
So you really just do what you’re told.
07:10
But it was really cool seeing just the weather.
07:13
Like I said, I grew up in the Northwest and had a pretty
07:18
limited experience on weather.
07:20
And then I went to the Midwest and the deep south.
07:24
And it was terrible.
07:26
[Laughs] Like grandma always said, don’t tell anybody about Oregon.
07:30
[Laughs]
07:31
So
07:36
you graduated high school.
07:38
Did you immediately go or community college?
07:40
Or did you have a plan at that point?
07:44
What was your path at that time?
07:47
I did not have a plan.
07:49
It was just one of those things where you get outta of high school
07:55
and you know you gotta do it.
07:56
And I took some years off.
07:57
I worked in restaurant industry, just kinda got by and lived on my own.
08:04
And then I just, one day, woke up to the fact that I needed
08:08
to start doing something.
08:10
I think it was probably a bad day at work or something.
08:15
Another thing that influenced my later decision-making, as far as education’s
08:22
concerned, was my grandfather was actually a principal in Salem, where
08:26
I grew up, at Sprague High School.
08:29
And my grandma was actually professor at Willemite Willamette
08:32
University for a short time.
08:35
So
08:38
my family had roots in education.
08:39
And it wasn’t until later in life that I came to terms with that and
08:42
started to respect it for what it was.
08:45
So I think just realizing that, realizing where I came from and support
08:52
mechanisms that I had for my family, that led me to join back up in school.
08:59
And you went to Chemeketa Community College, is that right?
09:01
Right.
09:03
Was that chosen because of its proximity to Salem?
09:08
Yeah, definitely.
09:09
I didn’t have any sort of means to pay for school anywhere else.
09:14
It was easy.
09:17
What was your sense of the institution, or impression, or general experience?
09:23
Honestly, I loved it.
09:24
I thought Chemeketa was a great college.
09:26
I can’t speak to the other disciplines.
09:29
I took your basic undergrad classes, some were better than others.
09:35
But once I got further along—once I made the decision to do engineering—the
09:40
engineering professor there, Mark Miller, he was excellent.
09:44
And honestly, I had few instructors that came close to
09:50
how good of an instructor he was.
09:51
And I can actually say that about a number of the professors
09:53
that I had at community college.
09:56
They were dedicated.
09:58
They had time for you, which isn’t always the case in a bigger university.
10:03
And they were inspirational.
10:04
So it was really great.
10:08
So I took an environmental science class.
10:11
It was just a science background class that I had to take.
10:13
It wasn’t for any reason.
10:15
It was a three-term class.
10:17
And that’s what kind of paved the way for environmental engineering for me.
10:22
It was really eye-opening.
10:24
And the professor that taught everything, was Wynn Cudmore.
10:29
He was excellent.
10:30
I’m not sure if he’s still there—I would imagine he is.
10:32
But, yeah he was very inspirational and very well-knowledged.
10:38
I would say if anyone in particular paved the way for where I’m at today,
10:41
it would definitely be Wynn Cudmore.
10:44
Did you consider going down another path of engineering?
10:48
What was it about environmental engineering, or that intersection
10:53
of disciplines that attracted you?
10:57
There was a number of things.
10:58
The real decision for me was music or engineering.
11:02
And I chose engineering.
11:04
And from there, it was either civil or environmental engineering.
11:08
And just based on, really, what I learned in that class and kind of wanting to
11:12
do something bigger and make an impact.
11:15
I mean, this whole interview, the topic of it is climate change.
11:19
And its huge.
11:20
And
11:23
it’s this looming mechanism that’s driving us.
11:25
So I wanted to do something about that.
11:29
There are ways to approach that from a civil aspect, definitely.
11:33
But I figured environmental engineering would definitely
11:35
be the way to go for that.
11:37
And another thing is that I wasn’t exactly sure what environmental engineering
11:44
is was when I made this choice.
11:47
It’s kind of a buzzword—actually, both of them.
11:49
“Environmental” and “engineering” are kind of buzzwords.
11:51
So that’s mainly what caught my attention—was just that I want to
11:55
be doing something with environment that has to do with engineering.
11:58
And it wasn’t until the last year or so that I really solidified
12:02
my understanding of environmental engineering and what that means.
12:06
But I’m happy with my choice, definitely.
12:07
And I can’t wait to get out and work and make a real change.
12:12
So around this time, your son was born?
12:14
Is that right?
12:15
Right, in 2013.
12:16
How did
12:19
that change your immediate reality at that point in your life?
12:25
It
12:28
came into two manners.
12:30
You have this driving mechanism that every parent, and every father, experiences
12:37
where you’re immediately grounded.
12:41
You’re just like, “Wow, this is incredible.” And it’s something more
12:45
than you’ve ever experienced in your life. And it makes you want to improve
12:50
yourself and just do all of the right things that you think you could do for
12:55
the world and for your family. And then, there’s also the fact that, personally,
13:03
it was a rough time in my life.
13:04
It was a lot to bring on financially, and as far as keeping
13:10
up with school and making sure that all my ducks were in a row.
13:13
So in one sense, it really drove me to where I’m at right now
13:19
which I think is the right way.
13:21
But at the same time, it also was a huge stress on my life being that young.
13:26
I was 23 years old when he was born, which is relatively young.
13:31
But I was not financially prepared for it.
13:33
So it was rough.
13:35
But we made it through.
13:37
My son is now 4 years old.
13:39
And he is just the light of my life.
13:42
And he’s incredible.
13:44
There was good and bad that came from it.
13:46
But as with any family or family ordeal like that, the good definitely dominated.
13:54
So
13:57
you transferred to OSU after a couple years at Chemeketa?
14:01
Right.
14:04
Did you always know you were gonna transfer to OSU?
14:07
Not OSU specifically.
14:08
I knew I wasn’t just gonna leave it at a transfer degree
14:11
or associate’s from Chemeketa.
14:14
And again, the choice was mainly proximity.
14:17
My dad went here, graduated from here.
14:21
Had some good recommendations.
14:22
I had my son.
14:26
So I wasn’t gonna relocate my whole family to somewhere else.
14:30
So OSU was the best choice.
14:33
What were you initial impressions of
14:38
OSU?
14:38
It was intimidating.
14:41
I kinda had this perception that I’m not sure where it came from.
14:47
I didn’t hear a whole bunch of horror stories.
14:50
But I had this perception that when you get into the university in an engineering
14:55
program, it’s immediately the most cut-throat thing you’ve ever done.
14:59
And I couldn’t have been more wrong.
15:02
I was really nervous to start my first couple of classes.
15:05
But once you get over the big auditorium classes and 300 students
15:11
and all that stuff, it was really just same old classes and more homework.
15:18
And then the further along I got in engineering, the more I realize that
15:21
the school is very accommodating.
15:24
And it’s competitive for sure.
15:26
But
15:30
I thought that I was gonna have to compete for the next stage every term, or
15:35
something like that, like if I GPA wasn’t a 3.9, then I would have been kicked out.
15:41
I’ve had a good GPA.
15:43
But it’s been really easy going for the most part.
15:47
It’s been challenging but, yeah, it’s definitely not as bad as I thought
15:54
What has it been like being a parent and a student at OSU?
16:01
It’s been tough.
16:03
There are some added benefits, though.
16:06
They only came across to me recently.
16:10
I
16:13
realized them over the weekend.
16:14
I’m a single parent and I get my son on the weekends.
16:18
And it’s the weekends that I don’t him, for whatever reason—maybe they’re out
16:21
of town or something—when I actually have free time, that I realize how
16:27
it’s this added benefit of having a kid where if I was just a regular student
16:33
with no other ties then I would have all these extra time just to mess
16:38
around and not do any school work.
16:39
But since I have my son on the weekends, various prescribed times,
16:46
nobody’s getting schoolwork done with a kid around.
16:48
[Laughs] So it limits the amount of time that I have to work on schoolwork.
16:53
And I know that when I sit down to do schoolwork during the week that
16:58
that’s what I have to get done.
16:59
And if I don’t, then I’ll see the consequences with bad grades.
17:03
So there’s that driving mechanism that I think has helped.
17:07
It just helped me not be so lazy, I guess.
17:11
Do you feel there’s a supportive environment or community
17:14
for students or parents?
17:17
Absolutely.
17:18
There’s some
17:22
concerns from the student parent community.
17:25
And I’ve heard them echoed by a number of professors as well.
17:32
We have provided daycare, which tuition covers.
17:36
So I don’t have to pay any extra money to drop my kid off for however long.
17:42
But yeah, it’s great cuz childcare is extremely expensive.
17:47
And in a little town like this, childcare is actually really
17:49
hard to come across as well.
17:51
You’d have lines waiting this for all of the good places to go.
17:56
So, it’s been a great relief to have that available at school.
18:01
I think the biggest thing is just you feel kind of isolated as a student parent.
18:07
At a big university like this, you’re definitely not the
18:13
rule, you’re the exception.
18:14
It’s not like I’m being condemned, or anything like
18:17
that, for being a student parent.
18:18
But it’s just abnormal.
18:21
But as far as the support mechanisms from the college, it’s been really great.
18:29
So your program is under the Chemical, Biological, and
18:32
Environmental Engineering department.
18:36
What has your experience been like under the Chemical Engineering umbrella since
18:41
that’s not traditional for environmental engineering at other universities?
18:47
For those that’re watching that don’t know, the CBEE
18:53
is the umbrella program for chemical, biological and environmental engineers.
19:00
We all take similar undergrad classes.
19:04
And then it’s not till senior year that we kind of branch
19:06
off into our own departments.
19:08
And being the most numerous, as far as students are concerned—and the most
19:14
common in the industry is chemical engineering—it has its impacts on those
19:19
that aren’t in chemical engineering.
19:22
And
19:25
it’s got its good and its bad things.
19:28
Chemical engineering, definitely, I think is—at least the way
19:31
that Oregon State approaches environmental engineering—foundational
19:35
in environmental engineering.
19:37
So I realize why they’ve structured the program the way it is.
19:42
But at the same time, you can kind of feel overshadowed by the other disciplines and
19:50
the work here doing is more relative to the other discipline and not your own,
19:54
which is a concern that is nothing new.
19:57
It’s been voiced by a number of students.
19:59
But at the same time, they have to choose a path to go kind.
20:03
So you just gotta suck it up.
20:05
I mean, mechanical engineers don’t only who mechanical
20:08
engineering their whole time.
20:09
They have aerospace and they have material science, and also their stuff
20:13
they gotta get worried about too.
20:14
So it’s unique to my experience.
20:20
But I think it’s definitely something that could be improved
20:23
on, as far as improvements.
20:25
I’m not a teacher, so I don’t know.
20:28
But maybe someday I’ll have some suggestions.
20:31
Do you think
20:34
had the program been under civil, as it is in other universities, that you’d
20:39
feel different about it in that sense?
20:41
Do you think that traditional fit would have been more appropriate?
20:44
So
20:49
that’s kind of the two domains that we consider environmental engineering
20:53
under, in academia, which is “is it structured under the civil program,
20:56
or is it structured under the chemical engineering program?” Oregon State is
21:01
one of the few colleges that does it under the chemical engineering program.
21:07
I thought about that—what my academic career would look like if
21:13
it were under the civil program.
21:16
And I would probably be voicing the same concerns, to a certain
21:19
extent, as far as “Why am I doing all this reinforced concrete homework.
21:24
I don’t wanna do this.” [Laughs]
21:28
So, yeah it would just be different.
21:30
I have no idea if it would be better or worse.
21:33
It would just be different.
21:37
Mark Miller, my engineering professor from community college, one of the things that
21:42
he said that stuck with me was that you take a mechanical engineer, a computer
21:49
engineer and a civil engineer, and you put them at the same job, and 5 years
21:52
down the road, you’re not gonna be able to tell the difference between them.
21:59
It was after he said that, really, I stopped worrying about the path that I’m
22:03
choosing, and less so about that, because it’s one of 100 different ways you could
22:09
go to get what you want to in the end.
22:15
There are definitely different things I would have learned,
22:17
for sure, in that program.
22:19
But I’m glad to have learned what I have.
22:22
And I think it’ll be useful looking forward.
22:27
Can you talk about what the EnvE program emphasizes at OSU, maybe
22:32
around faculty research and what you’ve experienced through the coursework?
22:37
So it’s a lot of water treatment—waste water treatment, drinking water,
22:43
groundwater remediation, less so the remediation aspect.
22:51
And as far as research is concerned, there is a couple engineering
22:57
education researchers that are just studying the way we learn.
23:01
And then the other researchers just seem to be, again, focused on
23:06
water treatment or the biological component, working with bioreactors
23:13
and biofilm remediation, which is all really interesting, definitely.
23:19
But
23:22
we’re just sort of limited in what we’re taught.
23:25
And again, it’s
23:28
the nature of the beast.
23:29
We’ve got environmental engineering which comprises of all of
23:34
these different disciplines.
23:35
You have chemistry and biology and engineering practice, and ethic
23:40
and all these stuff that you gotta jam into an undergrad degree.
23:43
So, again, I understand why they made the choices that they have.
23:47
And I think it’s a great program.
23:53
Does the program address climate change through coursework or faculty
23:56
research, from what you’ve experienced?
24:02
No.
24:03
I don’t think it does.
24:05
Environmental engineering, the way it’s taught at Oregon State,
24:14
is positively indirectly affecting climate change, I feel.
24:18
But it doesn’t approach it directly.
24:23
I think that climate change, obviously, is a global scale.
24:29
And environmental engineering is very local.
24:31
It’s access to water, it’s clean water.
24:37
It’s very localized effects.
24:39
But if this sort of thing were implemented globally, of course, it
24:42
would have an impact on climate change.
24:46
I guess you could say with some of the programs, it is encouraged through
24:53
energy conservation and water treatment.
24:56
Water treatment is a huge user of energy.
24:59
But
25:02
in our coursework, it’s the principals of the mechanisms for why waste
25:06
water treatment is effective and it’s not really like the underground.
25:10
This is the generator we’re gonna be using to blow air through our system.
25:16
It’s not exactly touched on.
25:19
But it’s definitely
25:23
supported by faculty.
25:24
I know that.
25:25
I’ve experienced it.
25:26
But as far as the actual program is concerned, I don’t think it’s structured
25:30
to approach climate change directly.
25:32
But I don’t think climate change, as it sits today—I don’t think engineering
25:42
is much of a solution to climate change.
25:46
It’s a political problem now.
25:49
I think maybe that’ll be a good question for a PoliSci major, because
25:56
I don’t see engineering as an approach, exactly, for climate change anymore.
26:00
Maybe it would have been 50 years ago.
26:02
But it’s definitely a political hot topic nowadays, and a global one at
26:10
that.
26:10
Speaking of global politics, or communities, can you talk about your
26:15
involvement with Engineers Without Borders and why you were drawn
26:20
to work with that organization?
26:22
So, it started in my first year at Oregon State.
26:27
And it was just a friend of friend that was in the program.
26:34
And it just started as kind of a selfish thing as an engineer.
26:38
You’d see all these students involved in organizations that are gonna look good on
26:42
their resume and I knew I had to find one.
26:45
And that’s just the first one I showed up to.
26:49
The program that I joined, at the time, it was called the new program because
26:55
they were still considering a community.
26:59
And normally, they’re named by their communities that they’re a part of.
27:02
So the other one is their Nicaragua program.
27:05
Ours is now the Cambodia program.
27:07
And it was great time to join because they were still choosing
27:14
where to implement their project.
27:17
There’s
27:20
a couple places that you could select from on where you want to work from.
27:24
And then you just take the project and interact with the community from
27:27
there and figure out what they want.
27:28
And then you work as a group to design a solution to their problem.
27:34
And for us, it was they have a lack of drinking water access
27:39
during their dry season.
27:42
Cambodia is definitely a water-rich country.
27:46
But as far as water quality, they’re definitely a water-poor country.
27:51
So water is just something that they’ve taken advantage of as a culture.
27:58
There’s not any water treatment in their entire country.
28:02
There’s no waste management in their entire country.
28:04
I think there’s one company but it’s highly politicized.
28:09
So back to your original question,
28:14
it’s been great.
28:16
I had a lot of chances to immerse myself in engineering culture
28:21
which is collaboration and
28:25
thinking outside of the box.
28:28
Water treatment and water supply and distribution have been
28:33
happening for years and years.
28:35
So it’s nothing new.
28:35
But it’s still piecing all of the pieces together and making sure that the end
28:40
product is addressing the problem.
28:44
So that’s been a lot of really good experience for me.
28:47
It’s been fun.
28:48
How has your role in the group changed overtime?
28:51
It’s primarily students who are addressing these engineering problems?
28:56
Right.
28:56
So the faculty aren’t really involved in the process at all.
29:01
They help with some oversight and design.
29:04
And they sign off on some travel applications.
29:08
But my role, it’s gone from showing up my first day and being terrified, and
29:15
not contributing anything, to I’m now the technical design team lead which
29:23
isn’t as fancy as it sounds but I get do delegate some of the design work
29:31
for the system that we’re implementing.
29:32
It’s really changed a lot.
29:35
And that whole sort of student involvement in the program has been a problem, I think
29:43
with Engineers Without Borders just in general, because you’d have these students
29:47
that show up and they want to help.
29:49
They want to do something but they just don’t exactly know how to go about it.
29:53
And the program doesn’t have a
29:57
program for them to learn about what we’re working on and how to involve themselves.
30:05
It’s definitely you make it what you want.
30:10
So if you show up and you just want to listen every day, then you’re
30:13
probably not gonna get much done.
30:15
But if you start asking questions and start taking things on even
30:18
if you don’t know how to do them,
30:22
then your role changes.
30:23
You get experience in doing something.
30:26
And you’re the specialist all of a sudden, and then people are
30:29
coming and asking you questions.
30:30
And you feel like you’re just a part of something finally.
30:35
And you’re contributing.
30:36
That’s how it started.
30:38
I basically wanted to involved myself in the more technical aspect of it.
30:44
So I started researching different filtration technologies, water filtration.
30:50
They’re really basic but they’re very popular for rural communities—ceramic
30:56
filtration and slows sand filtration, and then all of the different appendages that
31:01
go on with that, and how to incorporate it into a water distribution system.
31:06
So,
31:08
my role has changed a lot definitely.
31:10
But, like I said, it’s changed because I’ve made it change.
31:15
I have continually involved myself.
31:19
And you got to travel to Cambodia recently, right?
31:22
I did, yes.
31:23
Can you talk about what that experience is like, and maybe what the goals were
31:26
for the travel team while you were there, and how they were accomplished?
31:31
So the purpose of the trip was an assessment trip.
31:39
There’re two schools of thought—I guess you could call it—for why you travel.
31:46
There’s the assessment trips where you’re harvesting data, you’re
31:50
talking to the community and you’re figuring out what they want, and
31:52
you’re figuring out what is possible.
31:55
So this was the second assessment trip for our program.
31:58
They did one the year before.
31:59
So we had a little bit of data to go off of.
32:02
But the main goal for the trip
32:07
was to strengthen our GPS data, cause we had a lot of GPS data but it wasn’t as
32:13
well documented as we needed it to be.
32:22
So we did some topographic
32:25
survey.
32:26
We did some GPS mapping.
32:27
And then the meat-and-potatoes of the whole trip was the well testing.
32:33
We were planning on distributing water from
32:38
a number of wells that we were considering.
32:40
And we had to figure out their capacity, essentially.
32:42
So we had to run these well tests and got some really good data.
32:48
I oversaw a lot of that, which was fun.
32:51
And it was totally ripe with problems and things that we didn’t know how to handle.
32:57
But we had some local experts there that really helped us out
33:01
and just totally saved our lives.
33:04
It would have been a mess without them.
33:07
And then we did some community survey as well, which was really fun getting
33:12
out and talking with the community.
33:14
We had some translator for the NGO that worked in Cambodia.
33:19
And they were really helpful and a lot of fun to be around.
33:22
And
33:24
it’s such a different culture than I have ever been a part of.
33:28
Like I said, up until that trip, I hadn’t been out of the country.
33:33
And what a different country to go to for the first time.
33:37
It really opened my eyes.
33:38
It’s
33:41
kind of a side tangent—as far as the United States’ role in climate
33:49
change, it kind of opened my eyes that we’re not the only ones in this.
33:55
It’s always talked about in the news cycle and in politics.
33:58
And it just gives the impression that
34:04
whatever cards the United States puts in on the table is kind
34:07
of how it’s gonna get fixed.
34:08
But then you go and you see all these other countries that are doing as
34:12
much, if not more, damage as we are.
34:14
And that was a really eye-opening experience for me, just seeing
34:19
the state of unrest in Cambodia.
34:23
It was really powerful.
34:25
It was life-changing.
34:28
And as far as environmental engineering, it really opened my eyes.
34:34
I had this perception of what I wanted to do with environmental engineering
34:39
and I want to solve all these problems.
34:40
But all of a sudden, these problems in the United States are dwarfed by
34:44
these issues globally, internationally.
34:47
It’s made me reconsider.
34:51
I don’t have any answer for it yet.
34:52
But it’s made me reconsider on how I approach engineering in general.
34:55
So it was a really cool trip.
34:58
And I’m really glad I got to go.
35:01
Were you able to travel around the country and sightsee while you were there?
35:05
Is it mostly just project?
35:08
So we were there for three weeks total.
35:10
And we were in a natural community called Arona which is in Mondulkiri Province.
35:15
We were in that community for two weeks.
35:18
So we had about a week after the project to go explore and do what we wanted.
35:23
And yeah, we had a great time.
35:27
We went and we saw some elephant sanctuaries, which was really cool.
35:33
We got to see the
35:37
temples in—I can’t think of the names of them right
35:43
now.
35:43
Anyway, we got to see some ancient temples in Cambodia and that was really fun.
35:49
We got to spend New Year’s in Siem Reap.
35:52
It was a blast.
35:55
Had our battle with food poisoning later that night, which was not a blast.
36:00
But yeah, it was great.
36:01
We got to travel around.
36:01
And then the connecting flights there and back, we got to go to Japan and Singapore.
36:08
We were only there for less than 20 hours but those were really
36:11
cool countries to go to as well.
36:13
We made sure not to just stay in the hotel all the way.
36:17
We got into downtown Tokyo and went on wild goose chase for some authentic
36:23
Japanese Ramen which we found.
36:25
And it was the most incredible meal of my life.
36:27
And then on the way back, we went through Singapore.
36:33
And that country is also very well known for their culinary niche.
36:39
So, it was a really cool experience as well.
36:42
Do you think you’ll continue to work with Engineers Without Borders as
36:45
a professional after you leave OSU?
36:47
I would love to, yeah.
36:49
I really would love to.
36:52
I think it’d be cool be an overseeing engineer on a project.
36:57
I think that’ll a lot of fun to come in.
37:00
The mentor that we had for the project, she was actually a
37:04
working engineer in Cambodia.
37:06
She’s from Arizona but moved to Cambodia 5 years ago and stayed there to work.
37:12
And she had a lot of really great, on-the-ground experience.
37:16
She’s a hydrologist.
37:16
She was a
37:21
great organizer and really helped us piece everything together.
37:27
So I would love to someday play a role like that in a program.
37:31
That’d be great.
37:31
And I can continue as a graduate.
37:34
But your role is more of a weekly advisor than an actual mentor.
37:43
Are you involved in any other professional engineering organizations
37:47
or student organizations?
37:48
You mentioned you’re involved with the campus band as well?
37:54
That is just about it, campus band and EWB.
38:00
That’s about all I got time for other than my undergrad studies.
38:05
What is your sense, or perception, of how the student community on
38:09
campus is tackling climate change.
38:12
Have your gotten a sense through your activities or what you’ve
38:16
seen activities planned on campus?
38:20
I know there have been.
38:23
But I haven’t seen a lot of them.
38:26
I usually either look at a cork board and I’ll see ‘em and just be like,
38:32
“I’m too busy, I can’t do that right now.” I know that there are things
38:36
on campus but I haven’t involved myself in anything in particular.
38:42
You’ve touched on this in a couple of different ways, but how
38:47
has your perception of what an environmental engineer is, or does,
38:52
shifted over your academic career?
38:57
It has continually narrowed.
39:00
You kind of have this idea that you’re gonna go out, engineering the
39:04
environment and making all these changes.
39:06
But as far as how and what problems you’re tackling, you just don’t
39:12
know until you get into the program and talk to professionals.
39:15
So
39:18
I can’t say specifically what I thought I was gonna do.
39:22
But the farther I get into the program, the more I realize that—I knew—I wanted
39:27
to do watershed restoration, and that all sprouted from that environmental
39:33
science class that I talked about earlier.
39:36
We talked about the agricultural run-off in the Mississippi River
39:40
Basin and the resulting hypoxic settlement in the Gulf of Mexico.
39:45
And that was probably when I started reading into different case studies and
39:49
all of the science to back that theory up.
39:52
That is one of the biggest things that pushed me to do what I wanted to do.
39:56
And I think that that drive for what I want to end up doing
40:01
professionally is still rounded in that.
40:04
And I would still like to do some sort of river basin or watershed-wide work where
40:14
I’m improving water quality for an entire water basin, or for the delta that it
40:19
spills out into, or something like that.
40:21
Water is very critical in environmental engineering.
40:25
Not necessarily drinking water anymore.
40:26
It’s definitely a route to go.
40:28
But it’s
40:32
been figured out for the most part.
40:34
It’s not exactly a blind science anymore.
40:37
Whereas when you’re working with ecosystem-wide issues,
40:41
then it’s a big black box.
40:44
A lot of people think they know what’s going on.
40:46
But the further they’re getting, more and more people
40:48
just—its’ kind of a guess work.
40:50
So I really would like to
40:54
further my studies and professional work into either rive basin management.
41:00
I think wetlands have a very promising future as well, as far as
41:07
biochemically modeling wetlands and their effectiveness in treating pollutants.
41:10
Since
41:15
you’re graduating soon, do you have other professional goals or
41:20
milestones that you would like to hit?
41:26
I feel like the best way to go about that right now is through consulting.
41:32
It’s kind of the private industry of engineering and
41:34
I think that’s the way to go.
41:36
So I would like to end up consulting.
41:38
And I think every engineer wants to be a licensed professional engineer.
41:42
So I think right now, those are my two main goals.
41:48
I haven’t thought much farther than that.
41:50
I just want a job at this point.
41:51
[Laughs]
41:53
What do you feel like have been the biggest strength of the CBEE program, now
41:59
that you’re on the brink of graduating and
42:07
leaving.
42:07
I really like the way it’s structured, as far as the holistic career is concerned.
42:13
I always gravitated towards chemistry, I liked chemistry.
42:17
So I feel like they’ve incorporated that pretty well, as far as pollutant removal
42:25
and contaminant removal is concerned.
42:28
And I think that is a very foundational aspect of environmental
42:33
engineering which I’m not sure I would have gotten in a civil program.
42:37
I think they would have emphasized, like I said, it just would have been different.
42:41
But I don’t think I would have gotten the same breadth of the fundamental
42:48
roles of environmental engineering.
42:51
And I think that’s working with those chemical and contaminant cleanup.
42:56
Do you foresee going to grad school in the future?
43:01
Yes, in the far future, I hope at least.
43:08
Thing always change.
43:08
But when I was actually in drum corps—it was the first year that I aged out of
43:13
drum corps, so I was 21—I got the chance to go teach a high school marching band.
43:21
So I was the visual instructor.
43:22
I taught everybody how to march on their dots and how to look like a marching band.
43:27
And it was there that I learned that I wasn’t bad at teaching and that
43:33
it was something that I could do.
43:34
And after being a part of academia for so long, you just kind of
43:39
start to pick up on things.
43:41
I feel like I have an eye for how to teach people and how to instruct people.
43:46
So if I did go to grad school, it would be with that in mind.
43:52
I don’t know if I would end up in research, if that would
43:54
be where I wanted to end up.
43:56
But I would definitely like to get into teaching.
43:59
And I think community college would be the way to do it.
44:01
They seem like they’re just growing into a
44:07
evermore solidified institution, and hopefully someday that
44:11
will be paid for nationally.
44:14
And it won’t be what it is today.
44:17
And I think it’d been great.
44:19
I couldn’t see myself teaching high school of middle school.
44:22
But things change.
44:23
So maybe someday.
44:27
Okay.
44:27
Now we’re going to move on to the last set of broader
44:31
questions around climate change.
44:34
How old were you when you first learned about climate change?
44:37
Was it a part of your education experience at a young age?
44:43
No, it was not.
44:47
It was right about 2010
44:52
or
44:54
2011.
44:55
I was not young.
44:58
But it wasn’t anything that really struck my mind.
45:02
Nothing slapped my face when I was really young about it.
45:06
Here in the Northwest, we’re kind of in our own little sphere.
45:09
And we don’t really see a lot of the impacts of climate change.
45:14
Some of the developing countries have been exposed to that for a long
45:17
time now, which I did get to see.
45:21
But I really started opening my eyes to what happens in the
45:26
environment—it was about 2010 or 2011.
45:29
I remember it was during the Japanese earthquakes, the Fukushima earthquakes
45:36
and the Deepwater Horizon Spill.
45:39
That’s when I really started to pay attention to the new cycles and what was
45:43
happening, and how it was being treated.
45:48
And then that’s right about the time where climate change really started to
45:51
get popular, as far as the new cycles are concerned and on the internet.
45:57
So I would say that would be my first experience with it.
46:02
But it wasn’t, like I said, it wasn’t a big slap in the face ever.
46:04
It was just like a coming-to-age thing.
46:06
You start to open your eyes to these big global issues.
46:10
And they’re tough to swallow sometimes.
46:20
Since you started being more aware of it, have teachers change how they’ve
46:25
talked about climate change over the course of your academic career?
46:28
Do you think the dialog within education has shifted?
46:32
And as a part of that, from your perspective, do you think
46:37
it could be caught differently?
46:39
Yeah,
46:42
it’s definitely changed.
46:45
It’s changed with our growing knowledge of it, I think.
46:51
That can be illustrated by the fact that it’s not “global warming”
46:55
anymore, it’s “climate change.” And that has evolved because it used
47:00
to be taught as global warming.
47:01
And then there would be these large blizzards or rainfall events that
47:05
were so much different than normal.
47:08
And people would say, “Well, why is it called global warming if it’s
47:10
so cold right now.” So that’s why it’s more of the extreme weather
47:16
events that are the focus now.
47:22
That’s just one example of how it’s changed.
47:25
I’ve never taken a class exactly on climate change.
47:28
Obvious, I understand the mechanisms behind it.
47:32
But as far as it being taught to me and how my idea of it is different
47:37
than that, I’m not exactly sure.
47:38
But I just know that as we progress in our understanding of it, the
47:43
dialogue is bound to change.
47:45
And I think it’s absolutely changing for the better.
47:48
And I think the fact that it’s in the news cycles right now is also
47:51
all for the better, because it’s becoming more and more politicized.
47:55
So the more educated and professional people we have out there speaking about
48:01
it and driving the decision-making, I think it’s gonna be better, because
48:04
it’s not an individualized problem.
48:07
It’s not a localized problem anymore.
48:09
It’s very global.
48:10
And it’s about how countries are interacting with each other and
48:14
their economies, and what they’re encouraging of other countries.
48:19
So yeah, I’m interested to see where it changes.
48:21
And
48:23
if I do end up in teaching someday, what am I gonna be teaching about that.
48:28
Am I gonna be teaching about all of these problems that arise
48:32
because of some political decision?
48:34
Or am I gonna be teaching about some cool engineering solution that was proposed?
48:41
I’m just not sure yet.
48:44
Do you have ideas about policies changes that you would like to see happen
48:49
within the US around climate change?
48:55
Specifically, no, I don’t have any suggestions.
48:58
I’m just not well educated enough to speak on it.
49:04
But I do know that our democratic process right now is not
49:12
exactly a democratic process.
49:14
And I think, if we’re gonna be making any changes or making any sort of
49:17
impacts in climate change, it’s gotta be in the decision-making process.
49:25
The fact that we can go from having one president that does one thing and
49:31
supports all those different initiatives and is involved with climate change,
49:35
and involved in environmental funding and space funding, and all these stuff,
49:39
and then another president comes in the next year and wipes all that out.
49:43
And then now, there’re these entire federal organizations without funding
49:47
for something that some would argue to be a fundamental necessity for mankind
49:55
which is environmental protection.
49:58
The fact that that is a problem is just disgusting.
50:03
And it needs to be addressed.
50:06
There’re needs to be some sort of
50:10
consistent minimum funding that is addressed for necessary organizations like
50:16
the EPA and for all of these different organizations that are crucial to thriving
50:24
and not destroying the environment.
50:27
But as far as specific changes that can be made, I think
50:31
carbon taxing would be great.
50:34
I think that already is implemented, though, to a certain extent.
50:37
But there’s always room for improvement.
50:39
And I think discouraging polluters is the best way to get ‘em to stop.
50:47
How has having a child shifted your perception of the future of the planet?
50:52
And do you think about climate change differently as a parent?
50:59
Yes and no.
51:01
It’s always been an issue and it’s always been a concern of mine.
51:05
But it just hits you a little bit deeper.
51:08
And
51:11
it just saddens me a little bit more.
51:15
It drives me, of course, to wanna to do more.
51:17
But at the same time, it’s just—who I am—there’s not
51:23
much that I can do personally.
51:25
I’d have to go out and do some pretty incredible things, which aren’t outside
51:28
the realm of possibility, of course.
51:30
But
51:36
it’s definitely driven me to want to do more.
51:38
And when I realized
51:43
the age distribution, or how long my son could possibly be alive—he
51:49
was born in 2013—he could possible see the turn of the new century.
51:53
And that, to me, is just eye-opening when you start
51:57
thinking in time scales like that.
51:58
And that’s not even long.
52:00
That’s one generation and the outlook is not good right now.
52:09
Like I said, it just hits home even deeper and that makes me want to
52:12
do things and teach him as well.
52:17
There’s another generation that’re gonna be taking over after us.
52:20
And despite all the differences that we’re gonna have, we still need to
52:25
teach them properly and instruct them on how to go about making those
52:29
changes, which I think we’ll do fine.
52:31
I think our generation is gonna be pretty good at parenting.
52:34
As
52:38
a follow up to that, are you hopeful about the future of the planet
52:42
in the context of human change?
52:45
Again, yes and no.
52:49
I mean, hope is the only thing we have.
52:53
The future is definitely grim.
52:55
But
52:59
if you just close your eyes and [engulf] for yourself that everything is back and
53:04
don’t try to think of a positive way out of it, or try not to involve communities
53:08
in it, then you’re not gonna get anywhere.
53:10
So hope is what we have.
53:15
It’s the only way to make things better.
53:17
It lets us see the next day in a better light.
53:19
And hopefully that day will come.
53:23
Well, we’ve reached the conclusion of the interview, thank you for participating.
53:27
Thank you.
