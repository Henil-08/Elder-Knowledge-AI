00:02
Today is April 4th, 2018.
00:05
I’m at the Valley Library with Brandon Trelstad, Sustainability
00:08
Officer at Oregon State University.
00:11
Today, we’re going to be talking about climate change and his current
00:14
advocacy here at the university.
00:18
But I’d like to start with your background.
00:20
Where were you born?
00:21
Born in Salem, Oregon, not far from here.
00:24
Is there where you grew up?
00:25
It is, yep.
00:26
I went to high school, and came to Corvallis to go to OSU for
00:32
my freshman year of college.
00:34
What did your parents do?
00:37
My dad is—was, he retired—both of them are still living—a schoolteacher.
00:46
He worked in the Salem public schools for 31 years.
00:49
And my mom is also retired, a nurse.
00:52
So...
00:54
Did you spend time outdoors as a kid?
00:58
I did.
00:58
I spent a lot of time outdoors.
01:00
I grew up on 12 acres in south Salem.
01:02
And I had a pretty deep connection to nature, I guess, most of it sort
01:08
of roaming the forest and part of our property, and adjacent properties.
01:13
Had the luxury of growing up next to some public farm, actually.
01:18
It was state-owned property that was leased by the state
01:21
to farmers who would farm it.
01:23
And some years, it wasn’t farmed.
01:25
We had this big 20 or 30 acre of parcel in front of us that I would wander through.
01:30
And we grew Christmas trees and strawberries, and beans when I was very
01:35
young on my father’s properties which were all small parcels around that area.
01:41
I grew up driving tractors and other things.
01:45
Not urban farm, but we’re actually within the city limits, and
01:49
sort of a farm-like environment.
01:54
What was your school experience like?
01:55
Were you academically engaged?
01:58
I would say I was an average, or maybe ever so slightly above average, student.
02:03
I wouldn’t say I thought I was incredibly academically engaged.
02:07
I did okay.
02:09
I liked school, but I didn’t love it.
02:11
A lot of the usual things like tests and homework were things that I hated,
02:15
along with most students, I think.
02:17
And when I came to OSU, I really became more challenged academically.
02:21
I think high school and everything before that was pretty easy.
02:25
But I also came to OSU not really knowing what I wanted to do in terms of a degree.
02:31
I started out in engineering—quickly discovered that was not for me,
02:34
both from a preference standpoint and the skill basis as well.
02:38
I ended up going into environmental sciences here,
02:40
which was a much better fit.
02:42
But I wouldn’t say it was really easy.
02:44
[Laughs]
02:45
Did you decide to attend college right after high school?
02:48
I did, yeah.
02:50
I just took a summer off, and then came here in the Fall of 1997.
02:55
And at OSU, what kind of organizations were you involved in as a student?
03:01
I was not very involved as a student.
03:05
My primary involvement came through my internship requirement which was required
03:11
for an environmental sciences degree.
03:13
So that happened late because I sort of put that off until the end.
03:17
And I can come back to that because that led to this job and career.
03:22
Early on, I went to a couple of environmental affairs task force
03:26
meeting as ASOSU, but I didn’t stay very engaged as a student generally.
03:31
I was focused on academics and friends, and other college life things.
03:38
Did you have a career path in mind at that point when you
03:42
decided on environmental science?
03:44
I did not.
03:45
That was one of my greatest fears of graduating high school and coming to any
03:49
college, let alone here—is that I don’t know what degree I wanted to get into.
03:55
I didn’t, still, after the first year when transferred from environmental
03:59
engineering to environmental science.
04:01
And I didn’t really, as I graduated college either.
04:05
But I had a couple of really well-timed opportunities that led
04:10
to what was a career that turned out to be a really good fit for me.
04:14
I had a sense that I wanted to do something around—what I called
04:18
it at the time, in the mid and late 90s—environmental science,
04:24
or really, natural resources management that included the policy
04:29
and human aspects of environmental
04:34
systems.
04:37
But there wasn’t really a name for it.
04:38
I didn’t call it sustainability.
04:39
I didn’t really know that word.
04:43
That word, still today, means a lot of different things to different people.
04:47
I had a sense that OSU was a good fit for me because of this general
04:51
natural resources interest I had.
04:53
But in terms of a career, no I didn’t have a specific thing in mind.
04:58
And you mentioned an internship that played an important role.
05:01
Yeah.
05:03
So, as an environmental student, I had to do—I think it was—six
05:06
credits of internship experience.
05:09
And I waited, not just to the last year, but the last two terms to get
05:13
an opportunity lined up for myself.
05:16
Glad to say I’m not such a procrastinator today.
05:18
I learned some very difficult lessons.
05:22
And I ended up landing, thanks to my advisor in political science—because
05:26
I was a political science minor.
05:29
Bill Lunch was my advisor, and he stood, I could still hear
05:32
him on the radio today, for OPB.
05:34
He got me connected with the Government Relations Office on campus.
05:38
And because of my minor, that was a good fit.
05:41
And I had particular interest in environmental policy.
05:46
I got what was basically an internship and a paid position as a student,
05:51
my last two quarters of my senior year with Government Relations.
05:56
And that ended up turning into a part-time job when somebody left their position.
06:01
It was a two-person office back then.
06:03
The assistant to the director left.
06:06
So that was a job opportunity that presented itself and I took.
06:11
My job, at the time, was not necessarily natural resources
06:16
or sustainability related.
06:17
It was looking at all the legislation that was introduced in the 2001
06:22
legislative session in Salem.
06:24
Reading every bill—that means thousands of bills—trying to interpret what the
06:32
possible policy impact on OSU could be, and who was interested in that, and
06:37
then sending them a link to the bill.
06:39
So that was really hard work.
06:40
I think that’s difficult for anybody, even with a lot of institutional knowledge
06:44
like I built up over the last 15 years.
06:46
But back then, as a student who wasn’t incredibly engaged on
06:50
campus, that was a terrifying job.
06:51
So I learned, really quickly and in a very fast pace environment, how
06:58
to manage time and how to research information on the circa 2001
07:03
Internet with is not what it is today.
07:06
And try and understand who might be interested in these things that
07:10
are happening in Salem, which feels like a very distant connection and
07:13
yet, especially back then—and still today—has quite a bit of impact
07:17
on what we do here on campus.
07:20
Did that position inspire you to consider going into policy or law further?
07:27
Not really.
07:29
It actually inspired me to do something else.
07:31
What I missed in that process was my connection to nature and this
07:37
more deep interest in natural systems and sustainability.
07:42
So instead of pursuing something strictly in the policy arena, I wanted to focus
07:47
more on how humans interact with the environment and environmental stewardship.
07:51
And, certainly, those are policy questions but there’s a lot of
07:54
other policy that has nothing to do with our impact on ecosystems.
08:00
I didn’t necessarily want to live in the political science sphere forever.
08:04
And
08:07
were you in that position for four years?
08:10
Is that correct?
08:10
Yeah.
08:10
I was in the position for a little over four years, I think, and
08:15
then a little bit of overlap.
08:17
So, I did the current job that I have today as a part-time
08:21
position to sort of ease into it.
08:24
And part of that reason was because the position I have today
08:28
didn’t exist before 2005 or so.
08:33
To create a new position for whole new body of work is something that
08:36
even the institution has some concern over, and that makes a lot of sense.
08:42
To start a whole new program from scratch, it needs to be a very thoughtful thing.
08:47
The overlap was about three quarters to one quarter, where I would
08:50
work in Government Relations three quarters of the time, and then
08:52
the remaining quarter of the time would focus on sustainability work.
08:56
And then in November of 2005, transitioned fully to the sustainability work
09:01
after demonstrating some of the value that could be achieved, for a year or
09:05
nine months or so, of that overlap.
09:09
It sounds like you were working pretty closely with university administration
09:13
and policy makers as well in Salem?
09:16
Yeah.
09:16
I wasn’t really the one working with the policy makers in Salem, as much
09:19
as communicating what folks in Salem were doing back to the OSU community.
09:25
I have been involved a little bit in policy since then, at the
09:29
state level, but really minimally.
09:31
Mostly, it’s campus policy, working with administrator, students, and
09:35
everyone in between on the, first, environmental impact, and, now, more
09:40
holistic sustainability impact which includes social and economic aspects.
09:46
That, really, has been the focus of the work.
09:50
There’s a scope of policy work, but it’s a lot more than that as well today.
09:57
When you became a Sustainability Officer at OSU,
10:02
what was the university’s policies or attitude, at that
10:07
time, around sustainability?
10:10
How would you characterize at that attempt?
10:13
In 2005, I think we didn’t have a real way of articulating what our
10:19
priorities were around sustainability.
10:21
I would call it nescient, I guess.
10:23
OSU
10:25
has had a long history of really deep expertise in natural resources
10:31
and political science, and many other things that impact our
10:35
planetary systems and social systems.
10:38
We didn’t communicate that as a single type of work.
10:43
And really, sustainability is about the intersection of that environmental,
10:47
social and economic systems.
10:50
While we’re doing great work in the social systems and some work in economics as
10:56
well, not really tying those together in a way that’s messaged as sustainability
11:03
is an opportunity that was pretty clear in 2004, and ‘05 and ‘06, and still today.
11:08
We still have long ways to go, as most higher ed institutions do.
11:13
But that’s part of my work—is packaging these things together in a
11:18
way that organizations, external to the university, can understand them.
11:25
I had another thought but I’ll have to come back to it, because I forgot it.
11:29
[Laughs]
11:29
Had you anticipated on staying at the university and continuing your work here?
11:35
When I came here as a student, you mean?
11:37
I guess after you graduated.
11:41
I didn’t have a plan.
11:46
I was very focused, my senior year, on meeting my degree requirements.
11:51
I graduated in 4 years which was quite a feat given that I took 2 years
11:57
of French which did not apply to my degree directly, just I wanted to.
12:03
I had to retake chemistry.
12:06
So, to answer your academic question early, I certainly was not strong in that.
12:10
And I had this internship requirement.
12:12
And I had changed majors.
12:15
I ended up taking 19 credits my senior year, pretty much all year.
12:19
And I don’t even know if that’s allowed today, actually.
12:22
But I was very focused on the next day and the next week, not even the next quarters.
12:28
So I didn’t have a lot of planning in advance.
12:31
I’m really lucky, actually.
12:32
Really privileged to have those opportunities come my way, by way
12:37
of an advisor who really cared and connected me with someone.
12:40
That ended up being a great career opportunity.
12:43
And we’re good friends now, even though I don’t work for
12:45
the director in my relations.
12:47
We see each other more in social situations than
12:50
work—it seems like—anymore.
12:55
What appeals to you about focusing on sustainability within a
13:00
university environment instead of another institution or government?
13:06
That’s a really good question that I don’t think I get asked enough and I don’t think
13:09
we in the sustainability community ask ourselves that enough, or in higher ed.
13:14
I think it’s very future focused.
13:19
Higher education is a great place to
13:27
model social change and environmental change.
13:30
And it’s about the future.
13:32
We’re training the next generation of leaders, and business leaders and
13:37
community leaders, and government leaders.
13:40
I think we have such a high degree of impact here.
13:44
When we have students who have a really positive experience and they
13:47
realize we have really global systems in peril, and social systems in
13:52
peril, they’re getting the tools and building the tools here to be able to
13:57
do something about that in the future.
13:59
A lot about sustainability is not just about the environment today.
14:02
It’s about the environment of the future and the social systems of the
14:05
future, and the economy of the future.
14:08
Is it just and does it respect nature—because we know today it doesn’t.
14:13
Let’s not get too focused on those things.
14:15
Let’s focus on, “Ok, what do we do about the systems 20-100 years from
14:22
now?” There are other industries—maybe that have that future focused.
14:28
But probably, I don’t know if that’s true, as systematically
14:32
as with in higher education.
14:34
And of course, my whole professional career has been in higher ed.
14:38
I carry that bias as well.
14:41
I had a couple of other jobs—these were mostly summer jobs.
14:46
But in terms of careers, this is the only one I’ve had.
14:49
And I’ve only been in OSU.
14:53
I have to clear my bias in that.
14:57
I really enjoy the work because of that.
15:01
If we’re investing in all of these of types of changes that we’re talking
15:05
about, we need to be investing in the people to carry those out.
15:09
Our biggest asset here is graduates, and our biggest influence.
15:12
We have all the research that we do, and all that’s great.
15:15
But when we send 45,000 or so people out into the world every year, they really
15:23
need to have sustainability competence.
15:25
Or else we’re missing the mark.
15:27
And increasingly, some of them do—certainly not all
15:29
of them, not even half.
15:31
But that’s kind of the vision—is that everybody who goes through OSU is going
15:35
to have some sort of sustainability awareness, at least at a conversational
15:40
level to be able to recognize problems and understand their role, even if
15:45
they don’t have sustainability careers.
15:47
We all have an impact.
15:48
So that’s important to think.
15:52
What were your initial duties like in the first few years and maybe talk about how
15:57
your position has changed over the past 12 or 13 years that you’ve been in it?
16:03
Well, it’s changed a lot.
16:05
Each day in this job is different, it seems like.
16:10
When I started in 2005, I was very focused on operational
16:14
systems, mostly around energy.
16:18
The reason for that was simple—that’s where the financial savings come from and
16:22
that’s where they still come from today.
16:24
We still do that work, in a little bit different way.
16:26
We have a lot more partnerships now.
16:30
We have a staff of two now.
16:32
So there’s two of us, plus a team of 11 student workers.
16:36
It’s grown from just me to now this whole team of people.
16:44
The job started out focused on how can the institution save money by reducing
16:50
energy consumption and energy cost?
16:54
How can we participate in the energy incentive programs that the state
16:59
has, like the Energy Trust of Oregon?
17:01
If you do something like a lighting upgrade that meets a certain
17:05
criterion, they give you a check.
17:06
We were missing lots of financial opportunities by not having
17:10
this work coordinated and not pursuing additional work.
17:13
And there were tax credits, actually, back then that OSU could get.
17:19
I have calculated—for the first 4 or 5 years of my job, not only did I pay
17:24
back my salary, some of the years I paid it back four or five times over
17:29
in the tax credit passthroughs that would come back to the university,
17:34
which was a really good system.
17:35
And they’re not doing that anymore because it was too good.
17:39
But it really accelerated investments in energy efficiency and renewable
17:43
energy, up until about 2012 or 2013 when they did away with the program.
17:49
It gave a good head start to folks like me who could not just justify the
17:54
expensive existence of the institution, but really have some good project
18:00
money to go and do more work with.
18:04
Also, in the early years,
18:07
I was in a position of looking for projects.
18:11
We had the energy scope of work, but beyond that, I was looking
18:15
for things that we could do that would advance sustainability.
18:20
Today, it’s very different.
18:23
We have very limited funding.
18:24
We’re not going to be able to hire a third full-time person,
18:28
for the near future, at least.
18:29
Now I’m in a position of having to say “No” when people are coming to us with
18:34
ideas and partnership suggestions, and all these great things. Some of them
18:39
are just so good that we can’t say no.
18:44
We’re trying to address the
18:50
work of the need somehow.
18:52
But
18:54
it’s a very different environment today, also in terms of the number
18:58
of students who come to OSU and who say, “I came to OSU because of its
19:02
reputation about sustainability.” I was sitting on an interview panel in
19:07
the fall for student positions—these were eco-reps who do sustainability
19:13
work within the residence halls.
19:15
We had 37 applicants for seven positions, and we did 14 or 15 interviews.
19:18
I think nine or 10
19:22
of those 15 said they came to OSU specifically because of its
19:27
reputation around sustainability.
19:29
And of course, that’s like a subset of a subset.
19:32
I don’t wanna infer that two thirds of students who come here do it for
19:37
the sustainability work we’re doing.
19:39
But it is a significant portion.
19:41
And I hear it not just from people who are self-selecting into an interview pool like
19:45
that, but from students that I’m giving tours to in classes that maybe you don’t
19:50
think have a sustainability aspect them.
19:53
So I hear that more and more.
19:55
In 2005 or 2006 I never heard that.
19:58
It was a very vocal and small group of students back then,
20:02
most engaged around ASOSU and the student sustainability initiative.
20:06
And now it’s much more mainstream, which is great.
20:10
And the Pacific Northwest is a great place to do this work.
20:15
We have the luxury of having all these students come in who have an interest
20:20
in sustainability, but that means their standards are really high too.
20:24
And I think, a lot of the times, we don’t meet those standards—because, yeah we want
20:28
to be carbon-neutral, and we want to be purchasing goods and materials where we’ve
20:35
studied the life cycle and body demission cost of those things, which don’t have
20:41
the capacity, nor does our economy have the capacity to do that level of work.
20:45
But we’re seeing increased standards from our students and others, which is great.
20:53
What are the ways in which the Sustainability Office tracks
20:57
OSU’s environmental footprint?
20:59
You mentioned energy.
21:00
Yeah.
21:03
Our most comprehensive and detailed tracking is of our
21:06
greenhouse gas emissions.
21:07
Each year—and this is what my colleague does in the sustainability office—she
21:14
gathers information from across the state, extension offices, ag experiment
21:19
stations, Newport campus, Bend campus, Portland presence, everything.
21:27
Collects all the data about our fuel consumption, natural gas use, electricity
21:32
use, everything, nitrogen use even, and assembles our greenhouse gas inventory.
21:39
That’s a very detailed, very specific number that we come up
21:42
with at the end of that process.
21:45
Our other assessment includes sustainability more broadly.
21:50
We’re looking at the curriculum, and we’re looking at research
21:53
for the whole enterprise.
21:58
I think we estimated at one point we’re gathering over 1000 different
22:03
parameters, little bits of data, like the number of kilowatts
22:08
used at Burns experiment station.
22:12
And—what’s another good example—the amount of water used anywhere.
22:18
So we’re gathering a ton of information into this annual assessment.
22:23
It’s all transparent, it’s all online.
22:26
It’s a little overwhelming to have that much data.
22:29
One of the projects we’re working on right now is actually
22:31
sustainability indicators project.
22:33
Because we have the greenhouse gas emissions number which is one
22:38
figure for the whole enterprise.
22:40
And then we have this myriad of other data about the energy and the water use
22:45
that I mentioned, how many classes have sustainability in the curriculum, how many
22:49
classes are focused on sustainability.
22:51
We have all these indicators, but that’s too much.
22:54
So we’re going to come up with a list of probably 10 to 20—no more
23:00
than 25, I hope—key indicators.
23:03
And we’ll have a graphic element to this so it’s a little bit more user friendly.
23:07
We
23:10
need to be somewhere between one indicator and a thousand.
23:12
That’s something we’re going to roll out this summer.
23:18
Back to your previous question, when I started, sustainability assessment
23:23
really wasn’t well developed.
23:26
I remember meeting with Justin Fleming who was, at the time, the campus recycling
23:31
manager—he runs the motor pool now—but he and I scratched our heads and pulled our
23:36
hair out over sustainability indicators.
23:40
What do we want to start measuring, and then how do we compare
23:43
that to other institutions?
23:45
Or, do we just compare ourselves to ourselves over time?
23:50
We really never got that off the ground.
23:52
And I’m glad we didn’t spend a lot of time on it because a few years later in
23:56
2009, the STARS system was developed.
24:00
That’s an acronym that stands the Sustainability Tracking,
24:03
Assessment & Rating System.
24:05
So now that is an international standard that started here
24:09
in the Northwest actually.
24:11
And it’s used by over 500 institutions.
24:13
And we didn’t have to develop it.
24:15
We pay 400 dollars a year to use it.
24:17
It’s the best money we spend, in my opinion.
24:22
We have a pretty robust framework for assessment.
24:24
It’s just then what do we do with that data?
24:27
And how does it influence the policy decisions that our senior leadership are
24:31
making and our budget people are making about the investments for the institution?
24:35
And that’s what we’re hoping to use out indicators for.
24:42
And you were involved in working on OSU’s Climate Plan, is that correct?
24:46
I was, yeah.
24:48
Version 1 and version 2—or I should say, the process 2,
24:52
it’s a little bit different.
24:54
I was
24:58
basically the lead author on the plan that we released in 2009, which is more
25:04
of a strategic plan than a tactical plan.
25:06
It didn’t have an implementation component to it.
25:10
While we’ve done some things, like we have almost 10 acres of solar
25:14
arrays, which is awesome, that doesn’t reduce our carbon footprint a ton.
25:19
It’s a lot, but it’s only about 5%.
25:25
What we lacked from the 2009 plan was a really strict implementation
25:30
schedule and a budget to go with it.
25:34
We’ve done a lot of good things, sort of at the conceptual level.
25:38
We have a good green building standard that we’re developing
25:40
now that we’ve applied.
25:42
We have lots of energy conservation projects happening across campus.
25:47
But it’s not really happening in a as strategic or centrally
25:52
funded way as possible.
25:54
In 2017,
25:57
we began a process to rework that planning process.
26:02
Now we’re partnering with departments to create their own carbon plans.
26:07
For departments that have control over their building systems, for example,
26:13
that’s going to look very different than departments who just occupy a building.
26:18
They might focus on behavior and commute strategies and
26:22
purchasing and other things.
26:23
It basically respects the amount of influence a given state culture group
26:28
has over their carbon footprint, because for many of the buildings on campus,
26:34
facility services really is the primary mover and shaker of heating and cooling.
26:39
That is really the main source of emissions on campuses—from
26:43
heating and cooling our buildings.
26:46
It’s an evolving strategy.
26:47
And we’re certainly not doing as much as we should.
26:51
But in a resource-constrained environment, that’s kind of the reality we face.
26:55
We’re taking small bites out of a really big issue.
27:01
Is the goal still to be carbon-neutral by 2025?
27:06
Yes.
27:07
That is still the goal.
27:08
And I co-presented to a climate change class about three or four
27:15
weeks ago with President Ray.
27:18
I got to hear him talk about—which I had never done before, it was
27:20
really interesting—I got to hear him talk, unscripted, about his
27:25
philosophy about our 2025 goal.
27:29
I should have recorded it, probably.
27:33
His philosophy has always been: yes, it’s a very ambitious goal, and we might not
27:38
get there, but what would we have done differently if we didn’t have the goal?
27:43
How much less would we have accomplished in the last 10 years?
27:47
He signed the Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2007.
27:51
And in 10 years, despite tremendous growth, we’ve managed to reduce emissions.
27:56
Now, those emissions reductions have been modest, and we are not on track.
28:00
If you look at the numbers alone, we are not on track to
28:02
reach net neutrality by 2025.
28:05
But, if we had not set that ambitious goal, we probably would have
28:10
accomplished much less in 10 years.
28:13
I think his philosophy—and I totally believe this and I’m very thankful and
28:20
lucky and he has this philosophy—is that we’re set the goal very high,
28:25
maybe overly ambitious, but it’s to drive us more quickly in that
28:29
direction, even if we know we’re not going to get there and that’s okay.
28:33
Is divestment a part of the climate plan?
28:37
It’s not, actually, currently.
28:39
That’s a separate effort that I’ve been involved with, not one of the leaders of.
28:45
So that really has come from students and faculty.
28:49
Much to students’ credit, they’ve had good conversations of the past four or
28:53
five years with the OSU Foundation—OSU
28:59
Board of Trustees, and then the Foundation Trustees, two separate entities.
29:05
The OSU Board has made the decision to divest in our state holdings.
29:12
We have two endowments.
29:13
One is the pooled pot of money that is shared with the other public higher
29:19
institutions in Oregon, I think except for U of O. The other six are pooled.
29:26
That is a fund that we will be divested overtime.
29:30
The OSU Board of Trustees, I think much to its credit, has moved in that direction.
29:35
That foundation has not yet.
29:37
And these conversations are ongoing.
29:40
I think we’re meeting with students and some foundation representatives in the
29:46
next couple of weeks, not about divestment specifically, but about investment.
29:53
If we’re not going to focus on divestment because the Foundation Board
29:56
is unwilling, what else can we do?
29:59
Can we increase investment in green businesses and fossil
30:04
fuel-free businesses and funds?
30:07
Should
30:09
we have capital campaign to reach carbon neutrality?
30:12
That’s something I’ve tried to put on our leadership’s radar screen.
30:15
Aside from the investment issue—which I can support students and faculty,
30:19
but I’m not necessarily in position to be a strong advocate for divestment.
30:25
What we can do is a capital campaign.
30:27
So over the last four or five years, I’ve been trying to push that, including
30:32
sharing that thought with President Ray and Ed Fraser, the new provost, to
30:37
say “Hey, divestment aside, what can we be doing out there?” We haven’t really
30:42
made the ask of our alumni, friends and donors to say, “Hey, why don’t we
30:49
donate to a specific effort to reduce carbon emissions and to increase student
30:55
engagement opportunities when we do that work on campus.” It’s not just
30:59
about reducing emissions, it’s about the students experience and the research
31:02
experience that goes along with that.
31:05
That’s really the power of higher ed, right?
31:06
We have this big living lab that we work in every day.
31:10
We can use it not just as material asset, but as a learning asset as well.
31:15
That’s where I spend a lot of my time now.
31:20
I’ve been trying to push the capital campaign.
31:23
It doesn’t have a lot of attraction yet except with students, I think
31:25
students are really excited about it.
31:26
When a student speaks up and asks for something, it has a
31:29
lot more weight than when I do.
31:32
At least I’ve been sort of the pesky fly in the ear of our senior
31:37
leadership, and the Foundation saying, “Hey, we should think about a capital
31:41
campaign for carbon neutrality,” or for sustainability broadly if that’s what the
31:45
donor appetite wants then that’s great.
31:49
Our primary strategic objective around sustainability is to reduce
31:53
carbon emissions and to educate and give an experiential learning
31:58
opportunity to students along the way.
31:59
I’m really hopeful that a year from now, we’re going to be fundraising
32:03
for—I’ll call it—a carbon campaign.
32:08
That’s maybe not the best word.
32:12
[Laugh] I’m hopeful that in time, they will agree that
32:15
that’s a really good opportunity.
32:18
As a quick aside, we have a Foundation account that I
32:21
set up 6 or 7 years ago now.
32:25
Without any fundraising solicitation, every few months we get a donation.
32:30
People see the donation opportunities and there’s this
32:32
thing called Sustainability Fund.
32:35
Without even asking, we’re raising less than a hundred bucks a year, most years.
32:41
Image if we made the ask, and if the Foundation put—not all of its resources,
32:45
but—a significant portion of its resources into that ask, how much we could raise.
32:50
We don’t know, we’ve never done anything like that before.
32:52
I think it’s worth trying.
32:53
Even if it’s not millions and millions of dollars, we’ve got to make the ask.
33:00
That’s kind of what I’m pushing right now.
33:03
When you talk about working with students or guiding students, is
33:06
that mostly through the student sustainability initiative?
33:10
It has been.
33:12
Yes, and no.
33:12
It’s not exclusively there, but we certainly partner with them very
33:15
closely on a number of programs.
33:17
Our biggest sustainability events throughout the year
33:21
are usually partnerships with SSI and Campus Recycling.
33:25
Those are Earth Week—or Beyond Earth Day, it’s called now—the Sustainability
33:30
Festival in the Fall, Recycle Mania—Campus Recycling really takes the lead on that.
33:36
There’s a lot of partnered programs also.
33:38
Aside from our big event, we have the eco reps doing outreach
33:41
in the residence halls, a lot of food systems work right now.
33:45
Housing and Dining got a $27,000 grant to focus on food waste reduction.
33:52
I think
33:55
that may shape itself differently in the future, but SSI is sort of
33:59
the student-facing sustainability program on campus, but we
34:03
engage students a lot directly.
34:05
It really depends on what students want to do.
34:07
If students want to do some sort of research project or infrastructure
34:12
project, where it’ll use the campus physical asset in some way, that’s
34:16
typically through my office; if they want to do some sort of event or
34:22
peer-to-peer engagement activity, that typically is through SSI.
34:28
It really depends more on the programming than the audience.
34:32
Both those
34:36
two organization, Sustainability Office [SSI] and Campus Recycling,
34:39
have a bit of student engagement, student-facing material or
34:44
programming throughout the year.
34:48
How has your perspective on working with students changed over your career?
34:54
Oh wow, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked that, so that’s a really good question.
35:00
How’s it changed—well, I’ve gotten a lot better at working with students
35:04
and knowing what is a reasonable expectation of a student to achieve,
35:11
and over what period of time.
35:15
Being on the quarter system is incredibly limiting.
35:18
So I have strong opinions about the quarter system.
35:20
It’s bad.
35:21
And if we could be on a semester system, the more I hear from others,
35:27
my colleagues and others who work at higher ed institutions who’re
35:32
on semester system, it’s like “oh wow, that makes a lot more sense”.
35:35
But this is the system we have for now.
35:39
I think aside from managing my expectations and workflow and being
35:45
really specific with students about what the scope of work is that they’re
35:50
going to tackle, I think students—are coming to OSU—are a lot more
35:58
educated about sustainability issues.
36:02
We don’t spend a lot of time, necessarily, on that any more about the education
36:07
piece—I should say the awareness piece.
36:10
The early part of action always starts with awareness, right?
36:15
We don’t spend a lot of time on awareness.
36:17
We’re trying to focus on action more.
36:19
And action, when you’re working with physical infrastructure on
36:23
campus, the things that a student can do without imposing a safety or
36:28
liability risk is fairly minimal.
36:31
We’ve structured opportunities that minimize, or in some cases even
36:36
eliminate risk, and maximize their experience and what we get out of it too.
36:43
There’re still times when students come with ideas and we just have to say no.
36:47
Sometimes that’s out of our need to manage our time and resources.
36:51
Sometimes it’s because it’s not a good fit for the institution.
36:57
It’s, I think, building our capacity of training students to work with
37:02
other students as well—is really good.
37:05
When I started in 2005, it was just me.
37:08
I had no student workers.
37:11
I think our first student worker, we hired in ’07 or ’08.
37:15
That was a student who brought his own ideas and that worked well for a while.
37:22
But you really have to build up a lot of institutional knowledge to know how to
37:26
get things done in a large organization.
37:28
OSU, like any large organization, has its own culture and its own sets of rules.
37:34
You don’t know where to go to find those rules as a student necessarily.
37:38
Sometimes, I don’t know where to go, and I’ve worked here for 15 years or so.
37:44
It’s not a very welcoming environment to start without much guidance.
37:49
We try and set folks up with very specific opportunities.
37:53
What it looks like today is, less often students bring in their own ideas,
37:58
but us sort of saying “Ok, here is this task or project, and we haven’t
38:04
been able to work on this, or it’s going to take this number of hours.
38:09
And it’s a great student project.” It’s sort of primed and ready.
38:13
Usually those things have a lot of opportunity for students to influence
38:17
the process, not just the outcome, but to shape the scope of work as well.
38:21
It’s not just this pre-canned thing that we’re going to hand off to
38:25
somebody and it’s going to be busy work.
38:27
It’s usually a pretty enriching experience if it can be.
38:31
We have some things where it’s just going up pulling weeds in the field.
38:34
Surprisingly, there are a lot of people who are drawn to that, I think because
38:39
it has such a high degree of contrast to their classroom experience—is to go
38:44
pull invasive species along Oak Creek.
38:47
Or, I mentioned the 10 acres of solar panels.
38:50
Those are all ground-mounted in fields.
38:52
Fields get weeds.
38:53
We’d rather not spray the weeds with chemical pesticides if we don’t have to.
38:58
At two of the sites, we graze sheep.
39:01
The sheep are actually part of another research project,
39:06
unrelated to what we’re doing.
39:08
We can’t spray in those fields; we don’t want to anyway.
39:12
Those opportunities actually a few hundred people every year when we
39:15
offer them, much to my surprise.
39:17
Even when the weather’s terrible, people want to go outside and
39:20
get their hands dirty, just to have a different experience.
39:23
We hear every year there are a few people who’ve never done
39:27
something like that before.
39:30
That in and of itself can be a really good experience that is not
39:34
a traditional academic experience.
39:38
And you mentioned your collaboration with Campus Recycling in
39:42
efforts of waste reduction
39:45
Yeah.
39:45
What do you think of the future of look of local recycling given recent changes
39:50
to China's waste imports from the US?
39:53
Oh yeah, that’s a good question that we’re getting a lot.
39:56
I will fully disclaim that I’m not the expert.
39:58
Andrea Norris in Campus Recycling is.
40:02
Plastics recycling was already very difficult and operated on
40:05
an economic margin of near zero.
40:08
I think the unfortunate reality in the short term, although we haven’t really
40:13
heard from the local waste hauler specifically, is that we need to focus on
40:19
reduction of consumption, not recycling.
40:23
Plastics recycling, I think, even in a perfect world will always be difficult
40:27
because of the energy balance involved.
40:31
Metals are very recyclable and have a high value.
40:37
Plastics, not that way.
40:38
Paper is.
40:39
There’re some things that we just have to focus on reduction.
40:42
My
40:45
understanding is that in the short term, a lot of that stuff
40:48
is going to be land-filled.
40:49
Which is really sad because at some point in the future, what I
40:52
just said about recyclability could in different in 50 or 100 years.
40:56
But it’s not going to be different in 5 years, or probably not 10.
41:00
Wouldn’t it be great if this part of the landfill is all plastics, and we
41:04
can dig it up later when we identify its high value and have the technology
41:09
to really process it efficiently.
41:11
Waste reduction is really, I think to their credit, the
41:17
focus of campus recycling—it’s more of a life cycle approach.
41:20
It’s not just end-of-life approach.
41:22
And aptly, they’re located in PCMM, Procurement, Contracts
41:28
and Materials Management.
41:32
They have the connection with the influx of stuff that we get on campus.
41:37
I think, however, that’s one of our big opportunities—it’s
41:43
a big opportunity but it’s a tremendous of work—to look at our purchasing stream,
41:49
and to really think critically about what we buy and where it comes from,
41:53
and what are the wages of the people who is processing or making those goods.
41:58
There’s a whole scope of work around that.
42:04
Unfortunately, we’re part of a huge economic system that doesn’t
42:07
support transparency very well.
42:09
That’s not something that OSU has tackled because our economy is
42:15
not set up to measure and account for those things very well.
42:19
So, lots of opportunities, but I don’t know about plastics.
42:24
That’s kind of a… [laughs] I don’t want to be hopeless about it but I think
42:29
reuse and waste reduction is really the way to go, regardless of recycling.
42:34
That’s true for all of our goods and materials.
42:37
We should be buying in bulk and buying durable goods and materials,
42:41
regardless of how recyclable it is, because it’ll always take more energy
42:44
to recycle something than to reuse it.
42:50
Are you also on the Alternative Transportation Advisory Committee?
42:51
I was, actually.
42:51
Now it’s the Transportation Committee, it’s expanded the scope a little bit.
42:52
The ATAC, the Alternative Transportation Advisory Committee—I
42:52
don’t know when it formed, it was here before I got into this job.
42:52
But I don’t want to say disbanded, because it really morphed
42:52
into a broader conversation.
42:52
The Transportation Committee that we have today is the
42:52
combination of old Alternative Transportation Advisory Committee
43:23
and the Parking Committee, to look at transportation systems more holistically.
43:28
I happened to chair that committee, so I can answer questions about it.
43:33
I did serve on the old one that was focused more on bicycle and pedestrian,
43:37
a little bit on the transit experience.
43:39
All of those subjects have carried forward today into the Transportation Committee.
43:45
How did you get involved with that committee and the
43:49
committee you’re currently on?
43:51
And more generally, why is transportation important to you?
43:56
Well, I have a personal interest in transportation.
44:00
It’s something that everybody can relate to in some way.
44:04
Most people move from one space to another over the course of a day.
44:07
And just like food systems, that’s very relatable, everybody needs.
44:13
How I got involved was—there’s been a few things.
44:18
I’m not sure which came first, actually.
44:21
As the sustainability position evolved, it was sort of a natural fit
44:26
because transportation alternatives are about sustainable systems.
44:30
So I was invited to participate in that committee.
44:34
I believe—maybe this was 2005, or ‘06 or ‘07, some time in there—OSU had an
44:40
agreement with the city that required us to have a quarter-time alternative
44:46
transportation position, or TDM, Transportation Demand Management position.
44:51
So that was added to my work.
44:54
I don’t have that position anymore.
44:56
Transportation Services has funded a full-time position, actually one and a
44:59
half positions now, to focus on that work.
45:02
They’re doing awesome things and we partner with them really closely.
45:05
That
45:08
was part of the agreement with the city.
45:10
It was a natural fit.
45:12
I did a little bit of staff work.
45:14
We ended up hiring a student worker to support that work for a few years.
45:19
And then Transportation Services, under Meredith Williams’
45:22
leadership, has grown its support and capacity for that work now.
45:28
But why it’s important.
45:33
And this is true—I kind of geek out about carbon emissions in my
45:36
personal life, not just for work.
45:37
I’ll come back to that a lot.
45:39
I didn’t want you to think it’s
45:40
because I’m so focused on campus.
45:44
Transportation emissions, it for most people represents a significant
45:48
portion of our emissions, in some cases up to half, depending on the number
45:52
of air flags you take, air travel.
45:54
It’s really emissions intensive.
45:59
If we’re talking about the future of the planet and all of the things we’ve
46:03
discussed already today, transportation has to be part of that equation.
46:07
It can’t be just about buildings.
46:08
On campus, buildings account for about three quarters of our emissions.
46:12
And most of the remaining one quarter is transportation.
46:15
In my own life, I’ve used a couple different carbon footprint calculators.
46:20
I don’t fly that much, maybe once every couple years.
46:23
I bike to work.
46:25
I have a very efficient vehicle that I don’t drive that much.
46:28
Transportation, still, is a quarter to a third of my footprint.
46:32
Imagine somebody with a commute who is maybe doing both business
46:37
and personal air travel, that footprint is quite a bit higher.
46:41
If we’re talking about the future of the planet, not to be such a
46:46
downer, but couple hundred years from now, the life experience of
46:51
people will be very different.
46:52
We are responsible for their experience today.
46:55
That’s a burden that I carry very heavily, but I don’t think it’s
46:59
a common understanding of people living especially in the west in
47:03
the US and developed countries.
47:08
I don’t know that there’s that sense of intergenerational equity because we’ll
47:12
never meet those people and yet we have a pretty high degree of influence over
47:18
their daily quality of life in the future.
47:20
That’s
47:22
important to think about, I think.
47:27
You are involved with the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition as well?
47:32
Yes.
47:32
Can you talk about how you got involved with that committee and
47:37
what kind of projects you work on?
47:39
Yes.
47:40
The Corvallis Sustainability Coalition came along out of the Natural Step network
47:48
which had a small presence in Corvallis.
47:51
This is also back in 2007.
47:53
A lot happened in that year.
47:57
I, having been involved in the Natural Step, was
48:00
one of the founding members of the coalition and still serve
48:04
on its steering committee today.
48:07
I’m actually an advice facilitator.
48:10
I’m a distant second behind the person who’s doing most of the real
48:13
work, but that is the community sustainability organization in Corvallis.
48:20
As a coalition, it really is a network of organizations, including OSU.
48:23
So I’m the OSU representative to it as well.
48:27
I’ve been on the planning commission, I’m on the budget commission for the city.
48:32
I’ve been on the transit commission and I’m actually on
48:36
the advisory board now as well.
48:38
I’m really involved in the community sustainability, and the coalition is sort
48:42
of the place where a lot of that comes together outside of city government,
48:46
especially they’re one of the major organizations in town doing network.
48:51
How was working with the local city government compared to working with
48:56
university government administration?
48:58
It’s surprisingly similar, actually.
49:00
You know, the city of Corvallis, from
49:05
a footprint standpoint, the municipal operations are very small compared to OSU.
49:10
I think on the Corvallis campus, we have between five and six thousand employees.
49:15
They have several hundred—just to put that in scale.
49:18
And yet, the city’s policies influence OSU and the entire community, and policies
49:24
and practices, and purchasing decisions.
49:28
So
49:30
as policy and bureaucratic entity, although the scale is very different,
49:35
the reach is actually bigger.
49:36
But in terms of protocol and expectations, and professional process,
49:44
it’s surprisingly similar, actually.
49:49
Of course, they have a different decision-making process that’s different
49:52
than rolling up to a board of trustees.
49:55
But they have city council.
49:57
Ultimately, it’s similar.
49:59
I think OSU leadership has more autonomy.
50:02
We’re accountable to students certainly, and accountable to the board and
50:06
to some degree accountable to the general population and certainly our
50:09
neighbors, especially around town.
50:12
But the city is very accountable to the public.
50:16
Their entire purpose is to serve the city.
50:19
Whereas OSU’s purpose really is broader; it’s to serve students and
50:22
to serve the state in various ways.
50:23
So it’s a little bit broader in scope.
50:30
On a functional, practical basis, it’s hard to escape the
50:34
benefit you get from the city.
50:36
[Laughs] You got the water, police, fire, sort of thing, so surprisingly similar.
50:44
It seems like communicating with a variety of people or audiences is a big part of
50:50
your role as a Sustainability Officer.
50:53
Do you feel like your language or maybe strategies in communicating
50:59
about sustainability has changed over your career?
51:04
My language?
51:05
Word choice and language around sustainability, how that’s evolved.
51:12
Just as a professional, I started this career pretty young.
51:17
I certainly recognize—I’m still growing, but certainly early on,
51:23
recognizing—how to read the audience and how to understand the perspective
51:27
of whether it’s one person with whom you’re communicating or hundreds.
51:32
You really need to know a little bit about them, or at least, if you don’t
51:36
have time to have a conversation, be able to read body language and
51:42
to understand where you’re going into to be able to communicate
51:45
most effectively with any audience.
51:47
I think it’s really best to listen if you have that opportunity.
51:52
The language itself hasn’t changed that much.
51:56
Sustainability is always something that I’ve been asked to define.
52:01
I always push back on that a little bit because I think we can get really focused
52:06
on the definition and less focused on the meaning and the process to get there.
52:14
A sustainable system looks very different depending on the
52:18
system you’re talking about.
52:19
It really is about the conversation.
52:21
And more and more, we see those around social systems and economics systems,
52:26
not just about environmental systems.
52:29
I think the whole sustainability movement has gotten better about
52:35
interlinking social and economic aspects, not just environmental.
52:38
But we still have a lot of people who say, “Oh sustainability, that’s
52:41
all about planting trees and solar panels, right?” Actually, no, that’s
52:46
environmental stuff and that’s really great. That’s not sustainability.
52:50
Sustainability is, “Ok, where do those panels come from?
52:53
And do the people that make them, were they exposed to toxic materials
52:57
and what wages were they paid?
53:00
How far did they travel to get here?” It really is look much more from a system’s
53:07
standpoint and not at isolated acts.
53:10
I think that’s a lot easier for me to articulate now.
53:13
If you had asked me that 10 years ago, I would have some sort of word
53:17
salad that maybe would have made some sense in the context of that time.
53:22
We really have a better understand of how to communicate sustainability today, and
53:28
with people who may have opposing views.
53:31
And it’s to the arc of climate science, experience 10 years ago.
53:39
And still today, people are questioning “Oh is it a human caused?” Well,
53:42
the number of people questioning that is irrelevant at this point.
53:45
It’s such a small number of people with no credibility that it’s not
53:49
worth having that conversation.
53:51
But 10 years ago, if we knew—and some of the better practitioners in the field,
53:56
nationally and globally, were saying—
53:59
“What is your personal interest, what is your stake in this climate question?
54:03
And why is the science in question for you?” So I think we’re better today—not
54:11
just me but the sustainability movement is better at understanding opposing forces
54:17
or resistant forces, folks who want to keep business as usual and people who’re
54:23
ok with the massive wage inequity and wealth inequity we have here and globally.
54:29
It’s really understanding what it driving and motivating somebody.
54:33
And I think that’s worked its way farther into the DNA of
54:37
the sustainability movement.
54:40
Now I’m going to move on to some broader climate change questions.
54:45
Sure.
54:46
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like, and how
54:49
have they shifted over time?
54:53
Earliest conversations.
54:55
I thought about talking about this earlier so I’m glad we’re coming back to it now.
54:58
I think the earliest conversations that I remember were in high school for me.
55:02
And that was part of what was an innovative class back then.
55:06
A lot of schools in the mid-90s, high schools, were trying this block
55:13
system that I think has sort of gone away to some degree now, but maybe
55:18
more prevalent in some regions.
55:20
And that is a combination of classes in a larger period of time.
55:24
So rather than having two periods, you’d one and it covers the
55:29
intersection of two subjects.
55:30
What that was called, for me in Salem—I forget if this is in my sophomore
55:37
or junior year, but that would be in the mid 90s—environmental issues.
55:42
That was a combination of a traditional biology class and
55:45
a traditional US history class.
55:48
If you look at US history, wow, what an amazing and terrifying and depressing
55:56
body of work you have to study with environmental destruction.
56:00
There’re some hopeful pieces to that as well, and we’re not terribly
56:03
different than a lot of developed countries in that, but it gave a lot
56:07
of subject matter to examine under that environmental issues lens.
56:12
One of those big issues was climate change—and, of course, polar bears
56:17
and the sort of traditional, almost caricatures now, the most stereotypical
56:22
things you of when you think of climate change—they were new to me at that time.
56:28
And I was pretty young.
56:29
I grew up in a family where
56:33
my mom, and my dad also, were early recyclers in the 80s when it was hard
56:40
to do and you had to go to a place and sort it out, and it wasn’t really clear.
56:44
Of course, the bottle bill in Oregon has left an amazing legacy
56:47
of recycling since the 70s.
56:49
But still, it was not as convenient as it is today curbside.
56:54
I grew up with that being around of me, but we didn’t talk about it much.
56:58
It was just kind of what we did.
57:00
Then I got to high school and had this environmental issues
57:03
class and climate change was really clearly articulated then.
57:10
I think that was some of my first exposure.
57:16
The class wasn’t just focused on climate change but there’s
57:18
so many compelling things there.
57:20
It was like, “Oh wow, we’re really destroying the planet.
57:24
Alright, well, let’s go about fixing it.”
57:29
You’ve kind of already touched on this, but maybe you could talk about
57:33
the community of climate change activism here at OSU a little further?
57:37
And maybe how the institution has helped facilitate progress in this area?
57:44
Yeah, climate change activism.
57:48
I think it’s interesting you asked that question that way because I
57:52
wish—and I’ve always wished this since I started in 2005—that we had a little
57:56
bit more of an activist culture.
57:59
Of course, probably my bosses and their bosses don’t like me saying that.
58:04
If you look at other schools, the students really more
58:07
visibly and clearly want change.
58:12
We saw that a little bit with the divestment movement here a few
58:15
years ago when we have some really passionate, really activist-orient
58:18
students—really makes themselves very visible to the Foundation.
58:24
That was something that, in my role, I can’t participate directly in,
58:27
but I can support the students by providing them accurate information,
58:31
connecting them with the people of the Foundation so that they can have the
58:36
conversations, hopefully productively.
58:38
OSU
58:41
is a place of, I think, not quite as much of an activist culture as,
58:47
I’d say, U of O. I’ve been a little bit jealous of my counterpart at U
58:51
of O sometimes, although he’s been the target of some of those things.
58:54
So sometimes I’m thankful for it.
58:57
[Laughs] But it helps push us to do more.
59:01
One of my roles has been, not to—I never want to—try and contain students, or
59:09
suppress that activism because again, I think it’s really good and we could use
59:12
a little bit more of it sometimes here.
59:15
But it’s really important for them to have accurate facts.
59:17
A lot of the times,
59:21
assumptions are made based on inaccurate information.
59:24
My job has been to clarify that.
59:26
When people think, “Oh OSU administrations doing this, this, and this” I’m like,
59:30
“Actually, I meet with these people.
59:32
I’m in weekly dialogue with them.
59:35
That’s not how it is.” And the situation is one of budget.
59:41
You need to talk to your legislators, you need to get behind—although our
59:45
ability to lobby for things like Measure 97 and Measure 101 is very limited.
59:50
Those are important things that impact state budget that impacts us.
59:53
So again, it’s the system’s thinking.
59:56
I’m not going to go and yell at Ed Ray and have things solved tomorrow.
1:00:00
That’s not within his power.
1:00:04
We are part of a system.
1:00:06
Helping students recognize what the system is, identifying it, and what their points
1:00:10
of influence could be, I think is really important, and really empowers them more.
1:00:16
Sometimes, yeah it does take banging on somebody’s door, but more often
1:00:20
than not, it’s understanding where the problems are in the system.
1:00:28
That brings me back to the capital campaign.
1:00:31
We have not made the ask of our donor base.
1:00:36
I’m not sure why we haven’t, because I’ve been bringing it up for a few years.
1:00:38
I just think that ask hasn’t come from students.
1:00:42
Maybe that’s something students can knock on the door and say, “Hey,
1:00:45
why don’t you try this as a mini campaign?” I think that sort of
1:00:51
identification of systems and pressure points really does students a service.
1:00:56
And, to your earlier question about city government and
1:01:00
politics, the OSU bureaucracy is not so different than any other.
1:01:05
Developing those skills that center on system’s thinking and collaboration,
1:01:10
those are good skills no matter what organization you’re working with.
1:01:18
Does that fully answer the question or not?
1:01:20
Yeah!
1:01:22
This one will be even broader, on a nationwide perspective.
1:01:26
But, what kind of policy changes would you like to see happen within the
1:01:30
US, with respect to climate change?
1:01:32
Within the US?
1:01:33
Well, oh boy, where do we begin.
1:01:38
If you’ve watched the news in the last year and a half,
1:01:40
it’s been pretty horrific.
1:01:43
But I’m on camera so I’ll censor myself about what I think about
1:01:47
certain people in Washington.
1:01:50
Getting back into the Paris Climate Agreement is sort
1:01:54
of an obvious first step.
1:01:56
I think our next president, and next congress hopefully will be
1:02:01
willing to do the things that the Obama administration was doing.
1:02:05
And yet, that was not nearly enough.
1:02:08
I think Obama era was fine.
1:02:11
I like him as a president and as a person especially.
1:02:15
However, we are a massive bureaucracy, this country.
1:02:20
And I don’t know if we have the political appetite to do something
1:02:24
like a carbon tax, nationally.
1:02:25
I think it will take
1:02:29
paying the true cost of our energy first, but also our goods and
1:02:33
materials—ties back to a lot of things I was saying earlier about the life
1:02:38
cycle assessment and understanding the carbon footprint of all the things
1:02:42
we buy, and the electricity we buy.
1:02:45
The fuel and food especially are cheap because of subsidies we pay.
1:02:50
If you look at fuel in Europe and many places overseas, they’re
1:02:54
paying closer to the true cost.
1:02:56
And when I say true cost, I mean the true environmental, social, and economic
1:03:01
impact, not just today but over time of the consumption of these materials.
1:03:08
Climate change has to be a factor in that.
1:03:10
And if it is, we’re going to be paying more for bad stuff,
1:03:13
and less for good stuff.
1:03:14
Right now, solar panel costs have come way down.
1:03:18
However, coal is still cheaper.
1:03:21
If we’re paying the true cost of coal which includes the cost of climate
1:03:25
change—and we have smart economists who are able to put estimates on this,
1:03:29
maybe not perfect numbers, but we have a sense that we can get these numbers
1:03:33
if we want them—coal’s going to be more expensive than solar panels.
1:03:40
So our capitalist economy, both to our detriment and to its credit,
1:03:46
can make those shifts overtime if we’re provided with accurate cost.
1:03:52
That is something that really needs to happen at the federal level.
1:03:55
I’m very supportive of local taxes.
1:03:58
But if we have a gas tax in Corvallis, just to pick an easy
1:04:01
example, what’s to keep people from fueling up in Albany or Philomath?
1:04:06
Nothing, that’s what will happen.
1:04:08
It may help a little bit, but it really is not going to be the big
1:04:12
sea change of policy and action that we need to address climate change in
1:04:18
a timely way, to assure the future generations don’t suffer as much.
1:04:25
What changes to public education do you think would help Americans
1:04:28
better understand climate change, or perhaps change their behavior?
1:04:32
What changes to public education?
1:04:35
That’s a good question.
1:04:37
I think within the current paradigm, one thing we can do, and
1:04:42
we’re actually working on this.
1:04:42
So this is a partnership between SSI and my office.
1:04:46
We should have every graduate—I don’t think I said this earlier—every graduate
1:04:49
of OSU should have some sort of climate change and sustainability awareness.
1:04:53
And it doesn’t mean they’re going to go out and work in the field or
1:04:56
be advocates on the daily basis, but they need to have some exposure
1:05:00
to the concepts and principals.
1:05:03
We’re working on—we haven’t named it a really good name yet so this
1:05:07
is going to sound funny—a pathway’s program, or passport program whereby
1:05:14
you, as an incoming OSU student, would have the opportunity to
1:05:18
attend a certain number of events.
1:05:20
You’d take a class that’s in the existing curriculum, an existing catalog
1:05:25
class—we will provide a menu of that.
1:05:28
Go to a certain number of events, maybe have an on-campus job.
1:05:32
Basically have a checklist of thing that you cross off over the course
1:05:35
of your academic career here.
1:05:38
And you’d get recognition at the end.
1:05:40
You’d get a pin or a graduation stole, a graduation pin, a certificate,
1:05:46
something to put on a resume.
1:05:48
Eventually, it’s something to put on a transcript.
1:05:53
That probably is a couple years out but we want to have some sort of way
1:05:58
that students would be recognized for this competence that they’ve gained.
1:06:05
It’s going to start as an opt-in program.
1:06:07
Our vision is that maybe in 5 years, every OSU student does it.
1:06:13
They don’t just take one class and call it good enough.
1:06:15
They’d go to an event, or two or three.
1:06:19
We have the modules set up in Canvas, ready to go for the Fall.
1:06:22
So we’re piloting it right now, but it will basically
1:06:25
look like a class on Canvas.
1:06:31
That, I think, is what we can do that’s within reach right now.
1:06:35
I think making public higher education accessible and affordable
1:06:40
is the other big thing, and that talk about systemic change.
1:06:43
That’s really a years-long process.
1:06:46
To OSU’s credit—and our new provost talks about this a lot—I’ve been
1:06:52
really encouraged, actually.
1:06:55
I’m very impressed with what he’s saying about if we’re wanting to
1:07:00
be a top 10 land-grant institution, that often comes at the expense
1:07:04
of the lowest income students.
1:07:06
In that, one of the metrics, or indicators, of top 10
1:07:12
status is incoming GPA.
1:07:16
Well, do we want to have students with 3.75 GPAs that are basically
1:07:22
excluding or displacing access for a student with a 2.75?
1:07:28
Who needs the education more?
1:07:29
We’ve got to get real about what our role is as a public institution and
1:07:34
as a land grant institution, and make education affordable and accessible,
1:07:41
specifically and particularly, to people who might not have access otherwise.
1:07:47
Are you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
1:07:54
Yes and no.
1:07:57
If I had to pick one of those, I’m a realist and I would say “no.” I think
1:08:01
things have to get worse before they’re going to get better. That’s human nature.
1:08:07
The frog in the pot of boiling water analogy, you know—if you put the frog
1:08:11
in and the water heats up slowly, it boils before it knows to jump out.
1:08:15
That’s what we’re doing because humans, I believe, don’t have
1:08:19
a good institutional memory.
1:08:22
We’re experiencing a change in planetary systems that will take
1:08:26
place over hundreds of years.
1:08:31
We don’t have policy leaders who are going to experience that and be able
1:08:35
to say, “Oh well, it’s way different than when I was young 150 years ago. We
1:08:40
should really change this and prevent any more of our contributions to this
1:08:46
catastrophic change.” I think human nature is working against long-term solutions.
1:08:55
What I’m hopeful, though, the reason I have quite a bit of
1:08:59
hope is for a couple reason.
1:09:00
It has to get worse before it gets better, and it will get worse,
1:09:03
and we will adapt to change.
1:09:09
That has some problems with it because, in Oregon, yes, we will
1:09:12
adapt and it won’t be as painful as, like, Bangladesh where you’re going
1:09:17
to be losing massive amounts of land.
1:09:19
Even in Florida, losing a lot of land mass, being displaced.
1:09:22
That
1:09:24
has some really concerning equity components to it as well.
1:09:29
Another reason I’m hopeful, though, is because I think over time people,
1:09:35
especially in other countries—I think US and a few other places around the globe
1:09:40
are exceptions to this—I think humans will get back to more of a community-focused
1:09:46
than an individual-focused.
1:09:47
I think the fixation of individual rights and freedoms is really dangerous when
1:09:55
we’re talking about planetary systems.
1:09:58
I think that will change slowly, maybe not in my lifetime.
1:10:02
The community is where it’s at.
1:10:04
I think
1:10:07
we’re seeing now, because of enaction at the federal level, a lot of
1:10:13
community organizing around climate change and sustainability broadly.
1:10:17
What I’m hoping is that up and coming young people, and students especially,
1:10:23
see that as a means to an end.
1:10:27
That community organizing and focus on the community health is really
1:10:33
paramount, regardless of how big your community is—it could be Corvallis.
1:10:37
It could be a much smaller community.
1:10:40
And I don’t mean city.
1:10:42
I mean however you define community, a group of friends.
1:10:47
But our friends have to include future generations—that’s one
1:10:50
thing that’s so easy to forget.

We can see on TV, or on the Internet, people across the globe
1:10:55
suffering from climate change today.
1:10:57
We are not going to see what is like in 100 years.
1:11:00

1:11:03
Our communities and our government are our institutional memory because we don’t live
1:11:07
long enough to experience a lot of the
1:11:13
impacts from our actions today.
1:11:16
We have to have strong community systems.
1:11:19
And what that looks like in a lot of cultures is strong government,
1:11:22
or at least government with a good institutional and community focus.
1:11:28
Well, that concludes the interview.
