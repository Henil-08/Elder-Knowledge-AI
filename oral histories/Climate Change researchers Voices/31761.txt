00:01
Today is April 9, 2018.
00:04
We’re at the Valley Library.
00:06
I’m here with Dr. Hilary Boudet, an academic in the
00:09
School of Public Policy at OSU.
00:12
Today we’re going to be talking about climate change and
00:14
her research related to it.
00:17
But, I’m going to start out with your background.
00:18
Where were you born?
00:21
I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
00:23
Is that where you grew up?
00:24
No, I spent two years there and then my family moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
00:31
What did your parents do?
00:34
My mom is a social worker, so she does counseling and other things for families.
00:40
Then,
00:42
my dad is a science and technology writer.
00:47
I guess that’s kind of the best description.
00:49
He has a Ph.D. too in history and initially did some work on plan
00:58
communities, and when we moved to Tennessee he got a job with the
01:03
Tennessee Valley Authority and was working in their sort of history
01:07
and archeological department as they were doing excavations trying to
01:12
understand the historical implications.
01:17
Then he’s been a communications director for science organizations and journals.
01:25
What were your interests growing up?
01:26
Did you spend time outdoors?
01:30
Well, yeah.
01:31
Tennessee, well, actually Oak Ridge is a lot like Corvallis.
01:36
It’s a one-company town.
01:39
It was one of the secret cities for the Manhattan Project, for
01:43
the creation of the atomic bomb.
01:46
A lot of people that I grew up with, their parents worked in
01:48
the national lab in town and
01:54
there’s not a lot of other stuff going on.
01:56
It’s a lot of playing soccer.
02:00
We would go to the Smokies quite a bit and you know do that kind of thing, so yeah.
02:06
Did the fact that you lived in Oak Ridge have a strong impression on
02:12
your engagement or understanding of the energy sector from a young age.
02:17
Yeah, well the place itself is very science and technology focused.
02:26
A lot of the people, a lot of the parents and kids were very interested
02:30
in science and math and technology and
02:35
so
02:38
the schools were really good.
02:39
A lot of focus on education because a lot of people, a lot of the
02:43
parents had Ph.D.’s of their own in nuclear physics and things like that.
02:51
I think the thing that most influenced me about growing up there was
02:56
the relationship between the town itself having
03:03
a large-scale industrial development there and the community’s relationship
03:06
to that development because there were definite benefits and drawbacks from that
03:14
relationship, so I mean obviously the lab provided a lot of employment and people
03:19
were quite proud of the history of being involved in ending the war, but then
03:25
there was a lot of leftover contamination because when they were developing the
03:30
bomb they didn’t know exactly what the long-term consequences would be disposing
03:36
of some of the chemicals and radioactive materials that they were using.
03:42
A lot of times they just got sort of put in the backyard of the facility and so
03:49
one of the things that I didn’t think was odd at the time growing up but now looking
03:54
back was odd, so I played a lot of soccer and when we would practice and the ball
04:00
would go in the creek by the field we weren’t allowed to go get the ball because
04:04
the creek was contaminated with mercury.
04:06
At the time that just seemed like okay that’s the rule.
04:08
We just don’t get the ball.
04:09
Then when you talk to other people not many other people have a rule about
04:12
chasing soccer balls into a creek.
04:14
That left a big impression on me I think growing up.
04:18
It was more that side of it.
04:20
Both the focus on education which was really important but then
04:24
also the drawbacks of being in an industrial, a post-industrial site.
04:34
It sounds like there were people around you pushing you to go
04:38
to college after high school?
04:40
Yeah, definitely.
04:41
My parents for sure.
04:42
Both of them had graduate degrees of some kind.
04:46
Then the town, I mean I think at Oak Ridge had the most Ph.D.’s per
04:52
square mile because of the lab.
04:57
Many of my friends went on to do graduate school of some kind, yeah.
05:01
You went to Rice University for your undergraduate degree?
05:04
Mm-hmm, yep.
05:05
How did you end up choosing environmental engineering?
05:11
I actually did an interdisciplinary degree.
05:12
I did environmental engineering and political science.
05:17
Part of what was happening was Rice itself, Rice University,
05:22
has a strong focus on engineering and tech for a small school.
05:29
There was a lot of emphasis to get a degree in some kind of
05:31
science or tech or engineering.
05:34
I was taking classes on that path, but I was sort of getting frustrated
05:39
with not talking about people.
05:42
Then I took some classes in different disciplines in the social sciences that
05:46
would engage actually policy and people
05:52
and ended up meshing them together because when I would take those classes I would
05:57
want to learn more about technology and science so it was kind of a nice mix
06:01
for me to have both of those together.
06:04
Did you do any research as an undergraduate?
06:07
Yeah, I did.
06:08
I did an undergraduate honors thesis as part of the last year
06:15
you could sign up for a class.
06:17
I’m trying to remember on what it was.
06:18
It was something to do with Houston, because that’s where Rice is.
06:23
It’s to do with, I think it was about annexation policy in Houston,
06:27
because Houston has—I don’t know if you know—for those who know Houston
06:33
is an aggressive annexation city.
06:36
They tend to annex surrounding communities, and so it was—I can’t
06:43
exactly remember the research question but it was something
06:45
about annexation policy in Houston.
06:50
You worked after your undergraduate, right?
06:53
You didn’t go to graduate school immediately?
06:54
Yeah, I worked—I knew I probably wanted to do graduate school eventually,
07:00
but I wasn’t quite sure what in, so I worked for 3 years for Exxon Mobile.
07:08
How did you get that position?
07:10
So, my net was pretty wide, I cast a pretty wide net coming out.
07:17
I applied for some internships with cities.
07:21
I applied for some engineering, some more sort of straight engineering positions.
07:25
Then
07:28
I did some sort of informational interviewing on campus and Exxon did one
07:33
of those and it was the person who came had asked really interesting questions,
07:42
had interesting stories to tell about the type of work that might be possible there.
07:48
I have to say I was kind of skeptical going on because of Exxon Mobil’s
07:53
reputation, particularly coming in from the environmental side.
07:59
But I
08:02
think the informational interview convinced me to apply and then coming
08:09
out on the other end I had a couple offers and that was definitely the
08:14
most interesting one of the bunch.
08:17
That’s how I ended up there.
08:19
What kind of projects did you work on?
08:21
Most of the time I spent there I worked on an oil and gas development project in
08:26
Sakhalin Island in Russia, so it’s not technically the far east but very close.
08:32
It’s an island just north of Japan.
08:37
There were several multinational companies developing offshore resources
08:43
in Sakhalin Island at the time and I ran the socioeconomic impact
08:51
assessment program and the public consultation program for the project, so
09:02
it was a lot of learning in a very short amount of time coming in as
09:06
a 22-year-old and being thrown into a development project like that and
09:13
interacting with the public in a foreign country, but I learned a lot.
09:17
I learned really a lot.
09:19
Did you get to travel there and learn Russian?
09:22
Yeah.
09:23
I travelled.
09:25
I didn’t ever live there but I traveled back and forth quite a bit.
09:28
I did take Russian lessons and tried to learn as much as I can.
09:31
It’s a really difficult language.
09:33
A different alphabet.
09:35
I
09:37
tried to learn as much as I could, but we also had translators most places we went.
09:43
I would say I got pretty good at sort of travel Russian but most of the work that
09:48
I did I tried to do we used translators to make sure everything was said correctly.
09:57
What inspired you to return to grad school?
10:00
I was getting to this point working where Exxon Mobil has kind of, I don’t
10:09
know if they would describe it this way but this is how I would describe it,
10:12
they have their way of trading up staff is short stints in multiple places.
10:20
They want you to do like 2 years in environmental regulatory stuff and
10:24
then 2 years in production engineering and 2 years in—so they want you
10:29
to try construction engineering.
10:30
They want you to try all the different pieces of the business.
10:36
That just—my interest was in environmental stuff, social environmental stuff.
10:41
I didn’t really want to go.
10:43
They were calling it kicking the tires.
10:45
I didn’t really want to go kick the tires as a production engineer in a field
10:51
project, so when they started talking about that, that’s when I started thinking
10:57
about going back to school because that wasn’t what I saw as my path long-term.
11:04
It was also working in a big company like that where their main goal is
11:13
revenue, right, from production and sales and so when you’re working in
11:21
something that’s not part of the main goal it can be somewhat tiring because
11:30
you’re in some ways some of the things that I was doing was almost like the
11:34
internal police of the company, and so it can be a draining position.
11:43
I was noticing that about the people that had been there for a long time
11:47
in those roles, so I wanted to go back into a place where I would be in
11:53
the main focus of the organization.
11:57
How did you choose Stanford University?
12:02
Well, after the 3 years at Exxon, well one of the things when I was thinking
12:08
about going to graduate school is I thought maybe I wanted to do law.
12:12
I think the experience at Exxon Mobil taught me that I
12:16
really didn’t want to do law.
12:17
That
12:19
kind of took that off the table.
12:21
I started thinking about research more seriously and I knew I wanted
12:26
to do environmental so I applied to a wide variety of different
12:30
interdisciplinary environmental graduate programs around the U.S. and
12:38
it just I mean again the Stanford opportunity turned out to be the
12:43
best one, the right fit, for me.
12:45
One of the things I was really looking for was access to social scientists
12:53
as part of the program and a lot of graduate programs, the interdisciplinary
12:59
environmental graduate programs they tend to have more, I think this is
13:05
changing now, but at the time they tended to have more natural scientists
13:08
and engineers among the faculty and maybe one social scientist.
13:15
I thought that the program at Stanford because of the way it was set up, you
13:21
still had to find those people but you have more access than in some of
13:26
the other programs I was looking at.
13:29
What was it like moving to the west coast?
13:32
It was a culture shock a little bit.
13:37
I think it was as much a culture shock for me as it was for the other
13:40
people in the program, because none of them had come from the oil and
13:44
gas industry, I can tell you that.
13:46
They were mostly coming from either directly from school
13:49
or nonprofits or government.
13:52
I think in some ways they were more worried about who I was than the reverse.
14:00
I guess there were a lot of sort of
14:05
misconceptions about what someone who would be like coming from the oil and gas
14:09
industry and from Texas to California.
14:12
That was an interesting learning I think on both sides.
14:17
Then
14:19
just it’s a different place.
14:22
I really like it now, but at the time it was very different
14:26
than what I was used to.
14:29
How did your engineering background help you through this program?
14:33
I imagine it sounds like it was a different technical training
14:37
than other students possibly had.
14:39
Well, I think actually my engineering background, I wouldn’t have gotten
14:42
the job at Exxon Mobil without an engineering degree, because my
14:47
first title was a project engineer.
14:49
Even though I had a political science, they were interested in the political
14:52
science because of what they wanted me to do but they didn’t seem to bring in people
14:55
that didn’t have an engineering degree.
14:57
It was part of their culture.
15:00
It was interesting that the credential was important to get
15:03
the foot in the door for that job.
15:07
I think it did help again in graduate school because a lot of the coursework
15:12
that I took was pretty math heavy and even when you do social science and statistics
15:23
and things like that you have to think in that way and so I think having the
15:28
engineering degree helped to be able to do that piece and not be scared of it.
15:37
Your research was on politics conflict around energy siting?
15:42
Yeah, I did a series of case studies in different communities around the
15:49
U.S. where they have had proposals for large scale energy facilities trying to
15:55
understand how the community responded and I used theories both from planning about
16:04
the siting of unwanted facilities and then
16:09
theories from social movements, studies from social movements, about when
16:14
movements emerge to try to understand why some communities respond quite
16:20
forcefully and with a lot of protests to these types of proposals and why
16:24
other communities are more accepting.
16:28
That was kind of the main focus of my dissertation work.
16:33
Did you teach while you were a grad student?
16:35
Yeah, I did.
16:38
Teaching is not as big a requirement at a private institution as it is.
16:44
I see our graduate students teach more than we were required to,
16:51
but I actually liked teaching.
16:53
I really liked teaching.
16:56
One of the things that was happening, my program, my Ph.D. program was relatively
17:01
young, a relatively new program.
17:07
I think I was the third cohort.
17:08
We were really trying to figure out what is the right mix of
17:11
coursework for this program, because there’s not necessarily a model.
17:18
I worked a lot with some of the faculty that were really engaged
17:21
with the program on some of the core courses that would be offered.
17:26
Then I also taught a sustainable cities course the last couple
17:31
of years I was at Stanford which involved applied research projects.
17:37
It was working with undergrads and
17:40
they would work through, Stanford’s also on quarters, so over the course
17:45
of a quarter they would work through an applied research project with a
17:48
community partner, so we partnered with one of the local cities, Redwood
17:53
City, to do some projects for them.
17:57
One of the things that was happening at the time was they were putting
17:59
in those, like we see in Corvallis here, the bike rental, I forget
18:05
what it’s called—it has a name.
18:08
The bike rentals around town where you can take them from one place to another.
18:14
Redwood City was trying to figure out where would be good locations for those.
18:20
The students worked using GIS to do like a heat map of where people really would,
18:27
where they thought those bike stands would be most useful and most used.
18:34
It was things like that.
18:36
Did you at that point when you were finishing your Ph.D. did you think
18:40
you wanted to stay in academia?
18:42
Going in I wasn’t sure.
18:44
I thought well maybe I’ll get the degree and then go work
18:46
for government or nonprofit.
18:49
As I was finishing up my degree, actually my advisors were the ones
18:53
that were saying you should really think about an academic path.
18:58
I mean probably until like, I think my degree I took 6 years
19:03
and probably until year 4 I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.
19:07
They started saying that, and so I was like well maybe I should listen.
19:14
I still applied for other types of jobs, but the main thrust of my
19:19
applications was for academic jobs.
19:21
You did a postdoc at Stanford?
19:26
Yeah, as I was finishing up I was applying for jobs.
19:30
The
19:32
academic job market is tough, and so I was starting to realize as I was applying
19:37
that one of the things that really would help me on the job market to have
19:43
a postdoc to get out more applications but also to build a new skill set.
19:48
Because a lot of the work that I had done as a graduate student was more qualitative
19:54
but it was also I’d used a relatively new method to compare the cases.
20:01
I think part of what I learned going on the job market at the end of my Ph.D.
20:06
was that I needed to do a little bit more on the quantitative side so I purposely
20:12
chose a postdoc that would push me into that domain and give me I guess street
20:18
cred that I could do that kind of work
20:23
and it turned out to be a really good experience.
20:25
I worked on a Department of Energy funded project on the demand side
20:30
of energy as opposed to the supply.
20:32
We worked with 30 girl scout troops on a randomized control trial where
20:38
we taught half the troops about things they could do inside their home to save
20:44
energy and half things they could do in terms of food and transportation to save
20:48
energy and then did surveys before and after and three to six months later with
20:54
both the girls and their parents to see whether or not we changed behavior, and
21:03
those who were in the curriculum about the home energy, things they could
21:09
do at home did report, both the girls and the parents, reported changes in
21:14
behavior after and even at follow-up.
21:17
It was a really large, it taught me a lot about project management
21:23
and the quantitative skills that I wanted to get and then it was
21:27
a really interesting project.
21:29
It was really fun working with my 10-year-old girl scouts.
21:33
It’s a fun group.
21:35
Why target children in education them about energy usage?
21:42
Well, one of the things we were thinking about is, so we talk a lot
21:45
about learning as coming from parents to kids, but particularly in like
21:53
research on consumption basically
21:57
and other areas we’re starting to see a lot more research come out
22:01
about how kids influence parents.
22:04
So, thinking through if we’re in with the children not only can they set
22:14
good habits, routines for later in life so that they use less energy, because
22:21
those are formative years, right?
22:24
But also, then they could influence their parents.
22:27
Because now I’m a mom of 3, actually, and so it’s hectic.
22:33
Family life is busy, right?
22:35
So, especially if both parents are working, and
22:40
so a lot of times kids set agendas of what’s happening in the household,
22:45
what the discussion is about.
22:47
Right now, we’re into dinosaurs, so we’re talking a lot about dinosaurs.
22:51
To have the kids set an agenda setting role like that, I think that
22:57
was part of the thinking behind it.
22:59
Right?
23:04
Did you get your position at OSU following that postdoc?
23:08
Yes.
23:09
So, I did two years in the postdoc and then in my second year I was
23:14
applying and I got the job at OSU.
23:17
What were your initial impressions of university and Corvallis in general?
23:24
First, it reminded me a lot of where I grew up.
23:27
Because Oak Ridge was like 30,000 people and almost everyone was in some
23:33
way involved in the national lab and being in Corvallis it’s like 50,000,
23:38
so it’s bigger but almost everyone has some sort of connection to the
23:41
university or the hospital, I guess.
23:44
That
23:46
reminded me of the small-town aspect of it, it reminded
23:49
me a lot of where I grew up.
23:51
Then the university, so I think the thing that I was really drawn to about
24:01
the university was I thought that
24:07
the faculty leadership that I met with in the School of Public Policy really
24:12
had a clear sense, a clear idea of where they were going with the school
24:16
and I felt that what the type of work that I like to do, the applied,
24:22
community-based environment and energy focus, I felt it was a really good fit for
24:30
where the school was, the leadership of the school wanted to go.
24:36
For me it was really nice to land here and have that confirmed.
24:43
The other thing I have since learned about OSU that I didn’t
24:47
really know coming in was that
24:54
in other places, I mean the main other place that I’d been at
24:58
Stanford, some of the disciplinary boundaries, like the borders between
25:02
the disciplines are much higher.
25:05
You
25:08
know, where you publish is supposed to be in the tippity-top journals of the
25:14
discipline, which I think sometimes makes this harder to communicate to people
25:20
outside the discipline, because you’re so focused on communicating with your
25:24
own discipline that you can lose some of the breath that you need to talk to
25:29
people in other disciplines and so for me for someone who likes to do things that
25:35
spans disciplines it was a nice, people told me that coming in but to actually
25:42
experience it has been really nice, too.
25:46
Speaking of interdisciplinary work, you’re also associated with George
25:49
Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication, is that right?
25:53
Yeah.
25:54
How did you get involved with that organization?
25:57
That’s kind of a network story, right?
26:00
So, well, first of all I followed the work of, it’s actually George
26:07
Mason also has a partnership with Yale University where they do this
26:10
regular surveying on attitudes towards climate change in American minds.
26:15
I’d for a long time I’d followed those surveys and the results of those surveys
26:23
and then it turned out that when I was a postdoc at Stanford one of the people
26:28
that worked on that grant with me, her name is June Flora, she had been a faculty
26:33
member at Stanford who was the advisor of Ed Maibach who runs that center.
26:40
So, they had been talking about potential questions for the survey because they’re
26:48
usually doing those biannually, and she had forwarded that on to me and I had
26:55
sort of said something to the effect like we should be asking questions
26:58
about hydraulic fracturing because at the time it was a relatively new
27:03
technology for oil and gas development and I hadn’t seen a lot of people asking
27:11
public perception questions about it.
27:16
It seemed like it was going to be really important going forward and through
27:21
those conversations I ended up at one of their annual planning meets and I
27:29
kept saying that we should ask questions about hydraulic fracturing and they did.
27:34
I drafted some with June and they put them on the survey and that was, I
27:41
mean it was great for me because then we wrote a paper up about it and it
27:47
turned out to be a really well-cited paper, very useful because at the time
27:52
there hadn’t been a lot of research on public perceptions and since then
27:57
I’ve stayed connected with that group.
28:02
You’re also involved, or, it sounds like you incorporate community research
28:07
here in Corvallis with your classes?
28:09
Yeah, so I teach like I taught the sustainability cities
28:14
class prior to coming here.
28:17
I teach an applied research methods class to the masters students.
28:21
It happens during their first year as a masters student and in some ways I feel
28:27
like it’s a little bit of a capstone of the first year where they have all
28:32
these classes sort of in the abstract about theory and methods and then for
28:37
this class we do an applied research project with a community partner.
28:44
They work as a team on the class project.
28:47
That class
28:54
is really fun to teach because it’s not like a standard lecture class
28:59
because we’re working on this project the whole time and we have a client.
29:02
It’s much more like getting a project done, it’s more about the actual
29:08
research methods and project management.
29:12
It changes every year, which is really nice.
29:16
We’ve worked with, let’s see, I’ve done that now, that class 5 years now.
29:23
We’ve worked with the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition.
29:26
We’ve worked with Energize Corvallis and then since then we did a
29:31
couple projects on the coast, so we worked with the Oregon Coastal
29:35
Zone Management Association and most recently we worked with Oregon’s Ocean
29:42
Policy Advisory Committee, and so it’s just been a really rewarding class to
29:49
teach and I also think it’s a really rewarding class to take for the students,
29:52
because there’s only so much a grade matters but to have to present and put
29:58
something together for a real client I think really helps the students.
30:01
Now, actually, this year I’m teaching that class online, so that’s been sort
30:06
of getting my head around how to teach that online has been somewhat of a
30:12
challenge, but it’s nice to be challenged.
30:15
I think we’ve figured it out.
30:16
We’ll see.
30:17
I’ll tell you at the end of this 10 weeks.
30:22
Do you approach teaching online in general differently than in classes?
30:27
Yeah, in some ways it’s—so some of it is... there’s a lot more upfront work
30:34
that has to go in into, because it’s
30:40
asynchronous.
30:40
You have to have all the content of each week worked out at the very
30:45
beginning, whereas when you’re teaching on campus you have the readings and the
30:50
assignments worked out ahead of time but the actual things you’re going to
30:53
say in class you may be working on or updating right up until you go in there.
31:00
So,
31:02
that part is a little more challenging, but I think it enhances your on-campus
31:08
teaching because you have to do that for the off-campus, the online
31:13
students, I think it encourages you to think a little bit more in that
31:17
way for the on-campus students, too.
31:25
I taught one class last quarter and then I’m teaching again, this is the first
31:30
time I’ve done that in the off-campus stuff, and I do miss, we do a lot of
31:37
writing back and forth to one another, but there’s less, unless the student requests
31:42
a call or something, you have less of that face-to-face, so that part I kind of miss.
31:50
You get to know the students quite well writing back and forth to
31:54
one another, but there’s something different about hearing someone’s voice.
31:57
A lot of times I’ll try to have them do a presentation where they have to
32:01
voice over something just so I can hear their voice or see them in some way.
32:09
I’ll move on to some questions more broadly around your research.
32:15
In terms of mobilization around energy siting, can you touch
32:20
on some of the factors that influence how a community reacts?
32:24
Yeah, sure, of course.
32:27
I think in putting together, well first I want to say there’s a really wide
32:32
variety in the way communities respond.
32:34
I think sometimes particularly if we’ve been in a community where they’ve had
32:40
a project we might think that every community’s response is similar to
32:43
the response that our community had.
32:45
But it’s not true.
32:46
Some communities are much more active in terms of opposition and some
32:54
communities are very active in terms of trying to facilitate development.
33:00
Some communities there’s a lot of conflict because there’s
33:02
groups that feel both ways.
33:06
I think first and foremost is to say that is important.
33:09
And then
33:13
some of the main factors I started to identify as part of the project were
33:19
the community context, so thinking through what kind of experience does this
33:25
community have with energy development or just development more generally?
33:30
What kind of experience do members of the community have with mobilization
33:36
or movement activities or opposition?
33:41
Those kind of factors that are specific to the community can be really important.
33:45
Also, the economic situation of the community can be really important,
33:49
because some communities see this sort of development as providing
33:55
a way for, particularly in rural areas, for the community to
33:59
continue to be in existence, right?
34:03
Thinking through those types of, like the context within which the
34:07
project is proposed and how that then shapes perceptions of how
34:13
threatening the facility might be.
34:15
Because a lot of times we talk about mobilization.
34:18
We talk about the threat posed by something as a motivator and it
34:25
really depends, how people perceive the safety and environmental health,
34:30
community risks of a facility is really shaped by the context.
34:36
Really thinking through the relationship between those two factors.
34:40
Some projects that may seem very threatening in one community seem much
34:47
less threatening in anther community because of their underlying experiences.
34:51
Also, resources that are available within a community, not just monetary
34:55
but organizational, experiential to put together mobilization
35:02
efforts are very important.
35:05
Then the decision-making structure.
35:08
How are decisions being made about the facilities?
35:13
In some states, in some localities there’s a lot more points at which local or state
35:22
level officials have a vote on a project, whereas in other places for other types
35:28
of development the federal government has much more control over siting.
35:34
Thinking through how those decisions points matter in terms of where
35:38
the levers of influence local community members have I think really
35:43
matters for mobilization efforts.
35:45
That
35:48
was one of the pieces that I think is really important in terms of
35:51
communicating results to community members, because regulatory process are
35:55
often opaque and hard to piece together.
35:59
So, for community members to understand where people that might be sympathetic
36:05
to their concerns have a say, where decision makers have a say I think is
36:09
really critical in terms of getting results from mobilization efforts.
36:17
Do you find that there’s a similarity in response or maybe how
36:23
perceive a threat between renewable and nonrenewable energy siting?
36:30
I’ve done, we had one of the cases that I looked at in my
36:33
dissertation was a renewable project.
36:35
It was a wind project in Idaho.
36:37
Since then we’ve moved on to
36:41
do a study comparing different counties around the west that
36:45
have had wind energy proposals.
36:50
I haven’t been thinking about as much about what’s similar.
36:53
I’ve been thinking a lot about what’s different between more traditional
36:57
energy development and renewables.
36:59
I think one of the things that I’ve been focused on is that last factor I
37:06
mentioned about political opportunities.
37:08
In
37:10
the original research that I was doing as part of my dissertation a lot of
37:15
the projects we were looking at were large scale and had some sort of federal
37:20
involvement in the decision-making process because the way we selected cases was
37:26
they had to have gone through a final environmental impact statement and that
37:30
required federal involvement in some way.
37:32
But for wind and similarly for fracturing, for hydraulic fracturing,
37:38
a lot of the decision making is local.
37:43
Unlike in those projects where the federal government always had a say
37:46
and in some cases they had the only say, depending on state and local
37:50
regulations, in the wind projects that we’ve been looking at and proposals we’ve
37:54
been looking at the default is local.
37:57
It’s only when the turbines are located on public land or transmission lines go
38:05
through public land or something else that pulls in federal government involvement.
38:12
Otherwise, the default is like a county level permitting process.
38:18
I think that to me has been a really interesting difference, because one of
38:22
the things that we’ve found in those traditional projects is that the more
38:25
local elected officials you had involved in the decision making, the more
38:30
politically opportune the environment was for opponents, because the local
38:37
elected officials, if the opposition gathered momentum, right, they would
38:43
start to side with the opposition because they wanted to be voted in again.
38:51
Having more local elected officials involved seemed to make those projects
38:55
more opportune for opposition.
38:58
Whereas, because the default is local involvement in
39:01
wind, that doesn’t seem to be
39:07
the determining factor for whether or not
39:12
the decision-making environment is politically opportune for opposition.
39:16
Actually, sometimes having the fact that that federal government
39:21
gets involved and has sort of
39:29
more, how do I want to say this?
39:32
The systems for their decision making involve the creation of
39:36
environmental impact statement often, so the decision they have multiple
39:40
hearings and things like that.
39:41
That involvement actually in some ways helps the opposition, provides more
39:47
opportunity for the opposition than when it’s just a purely local decision.
39:52
In some ways it’s a little bit the inverse of what we’re seeing on the other side.
39:57
It’s forced me to really think through, rethink what is truly important about
40:04
political opportunity for opponents?
40:09
It’s not local elected, because that’s not the case in wind.
40:15
I don’t think we’ve gotten there yet, but really thinking through
40:17
what it is that creates politically opportune decision-making environment.
40:24
Maybe there isn’t one that’s consistent across all types.
40:27
Maybe it does depend on type of development.
40:29
We’ll see.
40:32
Do you interact directly with energy sector during your research?
40:36
Do you get feedback on their response to your research?
40:41
I usually try to have either myself or students interview company
40:46
representatives, the proponents of projects when we do this kind of work.
40:52
I’ve been pretty successful in getting them to talk about it.
40:57
But I haven’t done as much sort of
41:02
gathering feedback from them on the results.
41:05
I actually
41:08
in some ways I think the industries themselves, they have a lot of reasons to
41:19
pay money and to have consultants on board that know some of these things already.
41:25
Actually, I think some of the research is that much more beneficial for policy
41:30
makers and community groups who maybe in places where they’ve never had anything
41:35
like this come through and so to be able to learn from the experiences of
41:40
other communities I think is one of the real benefits of doing these kind
41:45
of comparative casework around the U.S. Because a lot of times when these
41:50
projects, sometimes they come to the same communities over and over and over again,
41:53
but sometimes they come to new communities so helping them to be able to have
42:00
examples from other places—I think they’re often seeking those out, anyway, so
42:07
putting them down on paper I think helps.
42:11
Some of your more recent research has been on people’s responses
42:17
to extreme weather events?
42:18
Mm-hmm.
42:18
So, I just—actually, we’re in the process of doing a lot of writing up from a
42:22
project that I got funded through the National Science Foundation a couple
42:28
of years ago looking at 15 communities that have experienced extreme weather
42:32
events and trying to understand if community members in those places were
42:40
connecting the event in any way to climate change, and even if they weren’t
42:45
what kind of policy outcomes happened in the wake of an event related to
42:49
climate change, adaptation or mitigation.
42:53
Trying to understand, because there’s been a lot of theoretical work that
43:01
in psychology and sociology that talks about the role of these sort
43:05
of personal, visceral experiences of climate change in shaping beliefs and
43:11
ultimately action, so trying to see if that’s actually what’s happening in
43:16
communities that do experience events.
43:21
We’ve finished all the, we did case fieldwork and we did
43:25
surveys in all the communities.
43:28
We’re now in the process of writing all that up.
43:30
Do you have an initial sense of—
43:35
Yeah, so I mean one of the things that struck me in working on this project is
43:42
that even in place, so one of our cases is the Colorado floods from I think it was
43:52
September 2013 that hit Boulder county.
43:58
That’s a place where given the presence of the university and all the research
44:03
institutions that focus on climate change, you sort of expect that these
44:09
type of events would be connected to climate change and would create action,
44:16
and we just actually published a piece showing that, yes, the community members
44:22
did readily connect the floods to climate change, even despite the fact
44:27
that some scientists were saying maybe this isn’t connected to climate change.
44:32
There was a ready connection there, particularly in terms of—but it didn’t
44:37
necessarily change views, right?
44:40
People in that community were already, most people in those communities,
44:44
maybe in rural areas of the county might be slightly different, but
44:47
particularly in Boulder itself were already quite concerned about
44:52
climate change to begin with.
44:53
It wasn’t like the event came in and changed a lot of people’s views.
44:58
Some of the things we did here talking to people there was that it
45:02
did actually have an impact on how
45:09
they perceived the risks of climate change and it made it more, it seemed more
45:13
real, particularly extreme weather risks.
45:17
A lot of the policy outcomes, then, were about adaptation
45:21
for future extreme events.
45:23
That’s most of the policy outcomes that were discussed when we talked to people
45:27
about it in the newspaper post event were about adaptation to future extremes and
45:35
particularly interestingly in Boulder they focused a lot on building social
45:39
resilience, which I think some of that might be about because they had already
45:44
done a lot of work on physical resilience because they have flash floods there quite
45:48
regularly and so it was sort of moving into the social resilience category.
45:52
Trying to get people connected to one another so when these events happen
45:55
they have a network of community members and groups to draw on to
46:01
recover and be resilient, right?
46:05
I think in that case we did see some of what scholars and
46:11
theorists have talked about but some less of other things, right?
46:17
In places where we’ve gone where
46:21
it’s maybe a more conservative community and climate change is not something
46:26
that people are actively discussing or reporting lots of concern about,
46:34
we’re not seeing much that these events are spurring much discussion
46:39
of climate change, particularly not
46:44
overt discussion of climate change.
46:46
Maybe sort of coded discussion.
46:51
I don’t know what other way to put it.
46:53
Sort of talking about climate change without using the words climate change.
46:56
So, talking about new normals or permanent drought.
47:02
Words that are implied from climate change, things that are implied from
47:06
climate change but because that phrase and global warming have become so
47:13
politicized in the U.S. in particular and you’re in a conservative community
47:17
I think people almost try to avoid that language and talk about it in other ways.
47:25
Then in terms of action, I have to say I don’t think we’re seeing a
47:30
lot of difference in terms of action post-event across the communities
47:35
regardless of whether or not climate change becomes part of the discussion.
47:40
I’m not sure why that is yet.
47:45
I think we’ll keep digging to try to figure that out.
47:48
But I think a lot of the, regardless of whether climate change becomes
47:51
part of the discussion a lot of the policy actions are quite similar.
47:54
Even in places like Boulder or other places in our set that
48:01
already think climate change has happened when the event occurs it
48:08
doesn’t seem that these type of events spark conversations about mitigation.
48:13
They don’t seem to spark conversations about how do we reduce emissions
48:18
post event, and I think some of that is just because these
48:21
events are very impactful, right?
48:25
So, it’s just hard I think to find space for that when you know there’s fatalities,
48:33
injuries, a lot of property damage.
48:37
Dealing
48:40
with that piece alone takes up a lot of emotional and policy space
48:48
and so trying then to move into how do we reduce carbon emissions from
48:52
that, we haven’t seen a lot of that in the events that we’ve looked at.
48:59
I’m going to move on to a final set of broader questions around climate change.
49:05
What were your earliest conversations on climate change like and how
49:08
have they shifted over time?
49:11
I don’t know.
49:14
Maybe I think one of the first times I really dug into the issue was part
49:20
of a class I took at Rice, actually.
49:24
I was part of an applied research project class.
49:27
Now that I’m thinking about it—I haven’t even thought about this
49:30
before—where we try to catalogue the carbon emissions of the university.
49:35
It was a group of undergrads and a faculty member and I remember we had
49:40
our excel spreadsheets and we were talking to the facilities people and
49:44
went and visited the Cogen plant and trying to figure out how to tally up
49:49
carbon emissions from the university.
49:52
I think that was some of the first conversations I had like in any sort
50:00
of in-depth way about climate change.
50:04
I guess maybe in that sense it was a pretty sort of taking stock kind
50:11
of engineering focus to it, right?
50:15
How do we catalogue emissions?
50:19
With the ultimate goal being how do we reduce them?
50:23
First getting a baseline handle on the problem.
50:29
Then I would think, so—given that is the first time I think maybe how my
50:42
studying of the issue and research on the issue and thinking about the issue
50:45
has evolved to incorporate much more thinking about the social science side.
50:52
How do people think about this issue?
50:57
What actions, if any, do they take on the issue?
51:02
What factors matter in terms of sociodemographics in terms
51:07
of how they perceive the issue?
51:11
Yeah.
51:15
How have we arrived where we are?
51:17
We’re so politicized.
51:20
I think that’s really been the major changes in how I’ve
51:27
examined the issue over time.
51:30
It’s funny I didn’t think about that.
51:35
Do you foresee being impacted by diminished funding for climate change
51:39
research during the Trump administration?
51:43
You know, I think
51:51
because I do energy stuff too
51:56
I think you can talk about
52:00
energy, like reducing energy demand with multiple frames, right?
52:07
One frame can be about reducing energy because of carbon emissions or switching
52:12
supplies because of carbon emissions.
52:15
I think on the demand side it’s easier because you can also talk
52:19
about it in terms of saving money, being more efficient in general,
52:23
not with efficient like about carbon but just efficient in general.
52:27
Less pollution.
52:29
I think there are other ways you can talk about, particularly on the demand side,
52:37
that maybe if I were more like trying to catalogue the impacts of it, like many
52:46
people on the campus are doing here, I think that might be a more direct
52:50
hit than some of the work that I do.
52:53
But, I mean, we’ll see.
52:55
I think it’s not just
53:00
funds, at least from the government that are going to decrease for climate change.
53:05
I think it’s going to be around academic research more generally.
53:08
But, I also think there is the possibility that you know foundations may pick up.
53:14
There may be private sources of money that pick up some of the
53:17
slack because of the—there’s a lot of concern about the issues, so
53:25
yeah, I think some of it’s going to be reframing and some of it’s going to be
53:31
hopefully some private monies will come in that will prop up some of this work
53:40
as the funding sources in the federal government dry up.
53:46
I want to be optimistic.
53:51
What kind of policy change would you like to see happen within the
53:54
U.S. with regards to climate change?
53:58
Well, you know I’d like to see us be more active at the national
54:03
level for many of these issues.
54:07
But at the same time, I mean not even just for climate change but also just energy.
54:14
Most of our strategies around energy policy are devolved to the state and
54:19
local level, so I’d like to see us maybe rationalize at a higher level, think about
54:29
regional planning efforts in that sense.
54:32
That’s the sort of planner in me talking, you know?
54:35
At the same time, I also recognize the importance of having those
54:40
local access points for decisions, because of the movement side.
54:45
The social movement scholar in me is like but we don’t want to take
54:48
away the local decision points.
54:52
So, you know I think that I’ve been, that’s been dueling
54:58
within me my whole career.
55:00
How do you maybe,
55:06
you know, think about something like energy facility siting at a more
55:12
rational, regional, or national level without losing local involvement?
55:20
I think you can find a balance there.
55:24
In the U.S. we tend to go to the local, state.
55:28
In other places, in Europe and other, they tend to centralize.
55:34
There has to be some sort of I guess happy medium in there where you can
55:38
have more centralized planning but maintain that local involvement I think.
55:46
Then, I guess on the demand side, I think we’ve seen a lot
55:52
of very effective policies.
55:56
There’s one thing nice about devolving things to the state is it creates
56:01
this sort of experimentation, right?
56:03
States can try things and see what works and somewhere like California has
56:07
been very successful in implementing policies around energy efficiency.
56:12
Thinking
56:16
about
56:20
how do we move beyond, then replicate those successful models in other places
56:24
given contextual factors that may change.
56:33
What about changes to public education that could help Americans
56:38
better understand climate change or potentially change their behavior?
56:44
That’s a huge question.
56:48
Well, I think on any—some of the survey work that I’ve done shows that on any
56:53
one issue that’s very specific, like climate change or hydraulic fracturing,
57:03
it’s only a certain segment of the population that really gets engaged and
57:08
knows the science of it and everything.
57:14
It might be nice to implement things in lower level so that
57:20
size of the population would grow.
57:22
But I’m not sure that, I just think anytime we ask about a specific
57:29
issue you lose a lot of people.
57:31
People lead busy lives so
57:35
it’s hard to get attention any one specific issue like that.
57:41
You asked about changing behavior.
57:45
Well, I mean I think some of the things that I’ve been trying to do with getting
57:50
kids engaged I think could be helpful.
57:52
At
57:54
the same time, I think it would be also helpful to pursue—I don’t think
58:01
there’s any silver bullet in any of these, particularly behavior change.
58:07
I think it’s important to focus on behavior change but I also think
58:10
you want to do things like make sure the technology itself puts
58:15
the least onus on the individual with the fewest carbon emissions.
58:24
Ways we can make homes smarter so that individuals don’t have to develop
58:33
their routines so much around the
58:38
house itself almost does it.
58:40
Like automatic lights.
58:43
Things that turn off when you’re not using them.
58:45
Those kind of things, because those kind of repetitive behaviors
58:48
are really hard to change.
58:50
They get routinized.
58:51
To the extent that we can engineer
58:57
and mandate engineering that takes out some of those, that
59:02
takes that off the onus of the individual I think is a good thing.
59:07
I think you have to pursue these multiple prongs of approach to solve the problem.
59:16
I think some of that is,
59:19
and that also means that when one is unsuccessful you have other things
59:23
happening that can create change.
59:26
I think it was the 2010,
59:31
the failed cap in trade at the national level.
59:37
Having multiple ways that you’re approaching the problem I think makes
59:40
any of those one failures less daunting.
59:44
Are
59:46
you hopeful about the future of the planet in the context of climate change?
59:53
You know, maybe 6 months ago a little bit more hopeful.
1:00:02
You know I think, I think one of the things I’m hopeful is we don’t have to
1:00:08
get to a crisis point to address it.
1:00:14
But there’s a lot of things going on in other places in the world that are hopeful
1:00:18
and in particular states that are hopeful.
1:00:25
Yeah, I do think we’ll figure it out, it’s just are we going to figure it out without
1:00:32
tremendous socioeconomic dislocation.
1:00:36
I think that’s the question.
1:00:39
Are we going to figure it out in time to avert some of that?
1:00:44
I’m not sure.
1:00:49
Well, on that note.
1:00:51
It’s not the most
1:00:53
positive note.
1:00:54
That concludes the interview.
1:00:55
Thank you for participating.
1:00:56
Yeah, sure.
1:00:56
No problem.
1:00:57
Thanks for inviting me.
