00:00
We are lucky enough to be here this morning to interview Charlie
00:04
White and it’s May 18, 2011.
00:09
Mr. White thank you so much for agreeing to do this.
00:13
I’m going to start off with just asking you to tell us your earliest
00:16
recollections, where you were born, what year, and where you grew up.
00:21
I was born in Detroit Michigan in April [static]
00:31
. I was the youngest of 9 children.
00:34
I had four brothers and four sisters, all older of course.
00:39
There are two of us left – myself and my brother next to me.
00:45
Typical childhood - we were poor but as Norm said last night, we didn’t know we
00:52
were poor - I never starved, I always had food, always had a roof over our
00:56
head, winter clothes and the whole thing.
01:00
And the old saying “cardboard in shoe” – we had a few of those.
01:07
It was just a typical childhood in those days.
01:11
What kinds of things do you remember doing as a child?
01:15
Playing games?
01:17
Hanging out?
01:17
Playing sports.
01:18
Playing sports.
01:20
My bother next to me, I kind of followed in his footsteps, he played
01:23
basketball and he played in high school.
01:26
He didn’t go to college but he played in high school.
01:28
But I used to watch his games and we’d hit the playgrounds on the weekends;
01:33
Saturday morning at the break of dawn.
01:37
We were out in the alleys and on the playgrounds playing basketball
01:42
– it was more like a religion.
01:44
We played all kinds of sports.
01:48
And contrary to popular belief there were some pretty good hockey players in my
01:52
neighborhood – being wintertime we played hockey and we played tennis and all that,
01:58
but basketball just became the sport.
02:01
Basketball and football and we had some good baseball players.
02:05
But basketball became the game of choice.
02:08
I played YMCA,
02:13
Jewish Community Center, but also one thing I did when I was
02:19
10 years old, 9-10 years old, I used to swim for the YMCA, and I wasn’t too bad.
02:23
But I transferred closer to a place near my home, and everybody left the YMC, the
02:30
coach left and everybody followed him.
02:32
And we used to swim against the cross town teams from the country clubs and all that
02:36
and we did pretty good against those guys – oh yeah So swimming was big to me, for
02:41
about three-four years, from about 9-13.
02:44
I was still playing basketball, but in the summer I did swimming
02:48
and in the evening I played ball.
02:50
But that’s basically what we did.
02:52
What do you recall growing up in Detroit around the racialization of Detroit?
02:57
You said you swam against the kids in the country club?
03:00
Did they have any kind of, you know, feeling toward you?
03:04
Well they did, but I mean nothing was said.
03:06
You now they had that superior feeling that they were better because they
03:14
had the much better facilities.
03:15
We had decent facilities but they had the country clubs and the whole thing.
03:22
But that feeling was there and it was always there - that we wanted to win.
03:26
I
03:29
loved Detroit but it was polarized.
03:31
I mean most of the blacks lived in about three of four different areas and the
03:36
Italians lived here and the Jewish people lived there and the Polish people lived
03:40
in a little place called Hamtramack and great athletes came out of Hamtramack.
03:45
But
03:49
we played against each other throughout the city.
03:53
But it was mostly black schools against black schools, there was only
03:57
one, that I can remember, one school at that time that had mixed athletic
04:02
teams and that was Cash Tech, which was one of the top schools in the city.
04:10
Roughly what year are you talking?
04:11
I’m talking mid ‘50s
04:15
So your high school, as I’m hearing you say, was not desegregated?
04:18
No, well I went to Cash Tech to begin with but I didn’t stay there, I ended
04:23
up back at my neighborhood school.
04:25
Yeah, the neighborhood school that I played the most basketball
04:35
at was segregated.
04:35
And that was pretty much it.
04:36
I did a lot of odd jobs growing up as a kid to generate income - I learned this
04:43
from all my brothers and sisters who all worked and went to school and graduated.
04:48
They all graduated from high school; none went to college; I was the only one.
04:55
But I worked at, you know, cutting lawns, washing windows, you know, whatever.
05:00
And then I got a job with a large grocery chain, Kroger’s.
05:05
And I stared working in the meat department, just kind of cleaning
05:09
up and everything, and I ended up getting a permanent job as a stock
05:12
boy – and, you know, doing okay.
05:18
Detroit…it was rough in the neighborhoods.
05:21
I mean you kind of had to establish yourself, but
05:25
I decided in 1958 that I had seen enough and a friend of mine and
05:30
I decided to say “let’s go see the world and join the military.”
05:38
We could have gone in for two years and gone to the Far East but I said
05:41
“no, let’s go in for three and go to Europe” so we could see a few more
05:45
places and that’s what happened.
05:48
You were about 18?
05:49
17-18? 19?
05:51
20, almost 20, 19.
05:52
And I played a lot of basketball when I was there.
05:53
In the military – can
05:58
you talk a little bit about that for us?
06:00
Well, we came in, I went into Fort Knox, a little bit right outside Louisville.
06:07
They had a
06:12
camp team and I went out for it, in order to make that team you had to stay
06:18
in the states and I traveled around and I said “Nah, I don’t want to stay
06:21
here, I want to go to Europe” so I went to Europe and got on the team there.
06:26
We played – we had like 50 games schedules and we had tournaments
06:31
. That’s a serious league…I didn’t realize that
06:34
And then I played a lot of games and enjoyed myself.
06:40
We went all over, Berlin, all over Germany.
06:45
And at that time that military was desegregated
06:48
Oh Yeah
06:49
So you were actually playing with white teammates
06:55
But there was several racial issues in the military
06:57
Can you talk about those?
06:59
The majority of MPs, Military Police, were white and from the South,
07:04
and they harassed us consistently.
07:09
Wherever we would be out,
07:12
there
07:15
was one African guy named Bobby something or other and he had a club, a very
07:21
nice popular club, and we would go down there ,and once or twice a month the MPs
07:27
would come down there and raid the club – pull everybody out and handcuff you.
07:34
Our team used to go down there –this was the track team at this
07:37
time and we had white kids on the track team and they would tell them
07:41
to go home which they wouldn’t do.
07:44
They would stay with us and they would take us to jail and lock up.
07:48
But we’d get out the next couple hours because we’d call our
07:51
colonel and blah, blah, blah.
07:53
You know, it was just harassment and it just
07:58
continued.
07:59
What else were some of your experiences in Germany?
08:02
What position did you have in the military then?
08:05
‘Cause it wasn’t just fully athlete – you had a regular job
08:09
I was in the army, the infantry, but I didn’t spend a lot of time doing that,
08:13
I spent what they call TDY, which is temporary duty and I would play sports.
08:19
I also was on the track team.
08:21
I didn’t know they even had that
08:22
I high jumped and triple jumped and broad jumped.
08:29
But I did that to pretty to much keep from doing my everyday duties – guard
08:33
duties, kitchen patrol, you know
08:38
those sorts of things.
08:41
So did someone recognize you in the military as being a potential athlete?
08:46
Or eventually college?
08:47
Talk to me about how that came about.
08:49
It was really funny.
08:51
We were in the gym one day and I was just shooting around and this white kid
08:56
from Southern California, he was on our team, Jones, Dick Jones, he came to the
09:01
gym and he asked me “what are you going do?” - it was getting close to my time
09:03
to come back to the states – and he said “what are you going do when you get out
09:06
of the military?” I said, “I really hadn’t thought much about it.” And he said,
09:10
“You ought to go out to California and go
09:14
to junior college, junior college is free, and then maybe you can get a
09:17
scholarship to a four year school” And I thought he was joking so I threw the
09:20
ball at him and I told him to “get out of here” and I chased him out of he gym.
09:24
Well guess what happened?
09:27
I did just that.
09:28
I got shipped to California from Germany, got out of the army, went to junior
09:32
college, then came up to Oregon State.
09:36
Now the thing that I noticed when I got here to California, I started
09:39
seeing names in the paper from some other junior colleges in Southern
09:42
California of guys I knew from Detroit.
09:45
So there was a lot of young kids who left Detroit and came out to
09:48
California and went to junior college.
09:50
What was that all about do you think because we heard a very similar thing
09:53
from Norm because he said that a lot of guys from his neighborhood in
09:57
Washington ended up in California.
10:00
What was maybe going on back then?
10:01
Well, for one thing, the junior colleges back there were not free.
10:06
Weren’t free in the East Coast
10:08
They were free in California, and if you were 21 you could establish residency and
10:15
you didn’t have to pay out of state fees.
10:17
So you could go to junior college free.
10:20
And these coaches would help you get an odd job here and there where you
10:23
could work and then you eventually got a scholarship to a four year school.
10:28
So a lot of kids came out, and plus, you know, who wouldn’t want
10:31
to come to California from Detroit?
10:33
You know, it’s snow this high, freezing, and there’s a lot of different
10:37
things going on, guys were getting in trouble - friends, relatives, you
10:41
know, were in that mix that you see
10:47
every day.
10:47
When I was about 17, you had to be 18 to go into the pool halls, but
10:53
everybody forged some kind of paper, and I used to hang around in the pool
10:56
hall and see a lot of stuff going on.
10:59
So you wanted to get away from that mainly.
11:01
More of a future
11:04
Yeah, just get out of that mix for a while.
11:06
And that was, you know, guys started coming.
11:10
And once a couple guys came, a lot of guys started coming and like I
11:14
said I saw guys names down in L.A. in different places from Detroit.
11:20
So I said, yeah, it was the best thing for me to do.
11:22
But anyway that’s what I did, and after that I came up to Oregon State
11:26
I’m gonna come back to that piece.
11:28
So you’re playing in junior college and someone identifies
11:32
you and says – who was that?
11:34
You know Paul and I were talking about that.
11:37
I don’t recall who it was but I think it was this guy that played
11:46
with Paul; his name is Doug and I don’t remember his last name.
11:50
As a matter a fact the last time I heard I think he was in pretty poor health.
11:55
But he and Paul played together and they were good friends.
11:58
And I think he might have seen me play in some tournament.
12:00
He lived in the general area and he called Paul and told him
12:08
about me.
12:09
But one thing that happened, the year before I came here, Slats
12:14
Gill came down to recruit me.
12:18
As a matter a fact he came to my house in the Seaside/Monterey area and I talked
12:23
with him, you know, and I didn’t feel good – just didn’t feel warm and fuzzy I guess,
12:31
and then a couple other coaches told me some stories about him – that I probably
12:35
wouldn’t get to play much, sitting on the beach and that sort of thing.
12:39
And I said well that’s not a good sign so I just didn’t come here.
12:44
And then the next year when Paul came down and we sat down and
12:47
talked, like I said, “I just felt it” you know, how you feel something.
12:53
Like I said, when we talked about me graduating I told him I needed probably
12:56
more than two years and, he said,” well I can’t give you that in writing but
13:00
I promise you that you will graduate “– anything over the two that I would
13:05
need to graduate, I would graduate.
13:07
And I felt that when I came up here, he focused on education right away as
13:11
opposed to just basketball, and laid out what I needed to do and that’s when I
13:17
started taking classes and got through it.
13:20
Can we come back to your situation with Slats Gill?
13:26
At the time the team was
13:29
segregated – there was no African Americans on the team at that point.
13:33
But in Southern California there actually were teams that were very mixed
13:38
Oh sure, sure
13:40
I wonder how, in your opinion, how do you think that he sort of rationalized that he
13:44
wasn’t going to allow his team necessarily to have an edge, because at that point,
13:50
I think it was really recognized that having African American players on the
13:53
team was really an edge because they brought a different game to the game
13:56
that – Norm was actually talking to us about the game that he was forced to play.
14:02
And that is a very kind of contrived
14:04
sure, controlled
14:05
controlled, it was a completely different game
14:07
running plays, setting picks - where
14:11
on a playground, it was you know one on one.
14:13
you just got it done
14:14
Behind the back, through the legs, or whatever, you know we were alley-ooping
14:18
then before it came into college.
14:24
.You know I really don’t know – I try to figure this out, because
14:29
every year, Slats had some good teams
14:32
he did, he went to the final four
14:33
But every year, almost every year – with the two years specifically that just
14:39
broke his heart, I know Bill Russell was at USF and they always played
14:44
in the regionals on the west coast.
14:45
And the west coast teams used to beat them every time and all of
14:49
them always had players of color.
14:50
right
14:51
And I thought to myself, you know, um, you know, I don’t know.
14:59
And you know the thing that was mentioned – the quota, “you start one black player
14:59
at home, two on the road” but Bill Russell coined the phrase “but five
14:59
when you’re behind” [DP and CW laughing]
15:00
You know,
15:04
Bill Russell started that.
15:04
Now, but I heard another explanation that “you start one at home and two on the road
15:21
because you gotta have somebody to room together”
15:23
Oh, interesting, interesting
15:25
You see that’s just what I was told, at that time.
15:29
Yeah, sure
15:30
And also at that time, in some parts of the country, you couldn’t
15:35
find lodging for black players.
15:37
So, you know, if you had to go play in some areas, it
15:42
was kind of like the old Jackie Robinson playing baseball – the team
15:46
stayed here and he found a place to stay in the neighborhood, at
15:50
someone’s home, you know, like that.
15:52
So I know some coaches had mentioned that and they were aware of that
15:57
and some felt uncomfortable with it.
16:00
Right
16:00
But I just don’t know; I think he might have wanted to pull the trigger
16:07
but I don’t know, he just didn’t.
16:09
Plus there weren’t a lot of kids up here for him to recruit and most of these
16:13
kids were local if you go back and look.
16:16
Now I think at that time Washington probably had some black players.
16:19
Washington had
16:20
African Americans
16:20
Eastern Europeans.
16:21
Yeah
16:22
That’s what I’ve always wondered when I was doing the research,
16:24
is to see, you now, you saw how California clearly had lots.
16:27
And you saw Seattle had a few
16:29
University of Oregon - they played them all the time
16:33
This guy was kind of holding the line and I was comparing to Rupp when I was
16:36
trying to understand what was going on – what was this guy trying to do?
16:39
Well, that was the feeling pretty much amongst those, you know,
16:45
athletes in California and different places, that he didn’t really want
16:48
any African American players really.
16:51
So, I guess nobody wanted to be the first with him because there was not that good
16:57
feeling about whether or not you’d be…
16:59
you could play
17:00
treated fairly – yeah
17:02
And so when Paul Valenti came down, did he ever tell you that “hey, I’m gonna be
17:05
the coach next, ‘cause I know I’m in line”
17:08
No, he was actually the coach when he came down – he had already gotten the job.
17:12
Oh, I see, okay
17:13
And I had read about it in the paper, but I didn’t think much of it really then.
17:17
He called me, contacted me, and then he came to talk to me
17:21
Right, so let’s know carry the story on to just talk about you now
17:24
arriving at campus and what were some of your earliest recollections - for
17:28
you, arriving on campus, seeing the place, what was that like
17:32
Well, one thing that was really funny, there was this
17:35
female named “Charlie White”
17:37
Named “Charlie White”?
17:38
Yes
17:39
Okay, alright
17:40
They put her in one of the men’s dorms [laughing] – they assigned
17:44
her to one of the men’s dorms.
17:47
And I got to meet her later - I met her at a party
17:52
Really?
17:53
Okay
17:53
Yes, so, but anyway, when I first got here, they had us doing
17:59
jobs in Cottage Grove – logging
18:05
In the off season?
18:08
Yeah but I came at the beginning of summer, so I went right into work.
18:14
So Cottage Grove is down toward Eugene – I think it’s East of
18:18
Eugene, out in the wilderness
18:20
okay
18:21
So they took me down there, and I mean, this was not a good situation.
18:26
The first day I was there, they took me in the evening, I said, “why are you bringing
18:30
me in at night?” So the next morning I come down and everybody’s staring and then
18:37
the next day someone told me that it’d be better if I didn’t come out at night.
18:43
So I called Paul and said…
18:45
this ain’t working
18:46
I’m leaving, you know, now.
18:49
So, they sent somebody and got me and I moved into Eugene – there was some guys
18:53
in Eugene that – there was four of them, three or four guys in this apartment and
19:00
it was mixed – a couple of white students.
19:03
And they were athletes and they brought me down there.
19:06
And every morning what we would do, we would catch a bus from
19:10
Eugene to Cottage Grove and work and then we’d come back to Eugene.
19:13
So you still kept the job
19:16
Yeah, but I didn’t live in Cottage Grove.
19:18
Yeah, because I told them I wasn’t staying - they need to get me out of there now.
19:23
So I came to Eugene and then I worked that summer in the woods which was good.
19:27
We made a lot of money – didn’t pay a whole lot, but at that
19:30
time it was a lot of money.
19:31
And we didn’t have any place to spend it, so all summer long we worked,
19:34
stuck checks in the bank so when school started we had a little money
19:37
That was common practice, I think
19:39
Yeah.
19:39
Oh yeah, we could work.
19:41
Plus we got a stipend – yeah, a monthly stipend.
19:43
So
19:47
then, started the season, and like I said, we had a, we didn’t have a very
19:53
good team, we were 7-7 in the league.
19:58
But actually it wasn’t the Pac-8, everybody says the Pac-8, it was
20:00
the AAWU, which is the Athletic Association of Western Universities.
20:06
Oh, okay, uh-huh
20:07
But it was the original 8 schools, the two in Oregon, two in Washington, two in
20:12
Southern California, two on Northern Cal
20:16
- the name Pac-8 came on later.
20:18
Anyway, we were 7-7 conference and 14-10 overall or something like that.
20:28
You know we weren’t really thinking anything big the next year, we
20:32
just wanted to be competitive.
20:33
And I had played small forward my first year here, but then they
20:38
put me at guard the next year.
20:44
The only new guy that came in, really, that really helped us, was Harry,
20:48
the only new guy, Harry Gunner.
20:51
He was the only new guy – African American who came in, oh and Loy Peterson.
20:56
They came
20:59
in and you know we were like a good seven, eight men deep.
21:05
What year was that when they came in ‘cause we didn’t find them
21:07
In ’65, but Loy was not African American – Harry Gunner was
21:11
Harry Gunner was, okay, alright, Natalia did that part of the research.
21:20
So tell me about that reception that you received, that you feel that you
21:24
received from the student body in that first year and the next year
21:29
Well, like I said, you know, I’m oblivious to a lot, and I’d been a lot of places
21:35
You were older
21:35
Yeah.
21:36
And so I mean, sure you got some looks, and you know
21:43
[laughing] , I just kept going.
21:44
I was here to do what I was here to do.
21:49
One incident was,
21:54
one of the players, a freshman player, who I knew, not very
21:59
well, but I knew who he was.
22:01
We were on campus and he was with his girlfriend and he stopped and he
22:07
introduced me and she made a comment, “oh you’re the one in my girlfriend’s
22:12
class” And I said, “the one what?” [laughing] and she was totally
22:18
embarrassed, and couldn’t even answer.
22:20
And so I just said, “I’ll see you guys later” But, uh, it was kind of funny
22:28
[laughing] . But like I said, most of the kids up here had never been around
22:32
any black people, let alone go to school with them, because I had run into that
22:38
in the army, I had guys in the army, who lived, mostly Southerners, who
22:43
had seen, they told me, they’d seen black people from a distance, but you
22:46
know, didn’t know - and that was that.
22:48
They were from the South – living in those little small towns,
22:51
Mississippi, and places like that.
22:53
Right
22:54
But I didn’t, I didn’t feel anything in classes
23:00
Professors treat you?
23:01
Yeah, professors – I didn’t feel anything, teachers or students in the classes.
23:06
You know, there was an occasional yell out of somebody’s car, you
23:13
know.
23:14
And finding accommodation in Corvallis?
23:17
And recreation in Corvallis?
23:18
What was that like for you?
23:21
Well, the main thing is, the house that I moved into when I came out here was
23:24
already occupied by African-Americans, so I didn’t have a problem with that.
23:27
And, how did you find that?
23:28
Did the coach find that for you, that accommodation?
23:31
I think so.
23:34
But they were football players and one was a non-athlete, Walter
23:40
Lothridge, he’s a pharmacist.
23:42
Though when we were in a group we always told everybody he played tennis.
23:46
He as about 5’4” / 5’5” and he was a little overweight, you know, but
23:51
he was one of my best friends, he lives near me in California now.
23:57
They were there, and then we moved to another house, on I think
23:59
it was 17th near the coliseum.
24:02
And, we never had a problem, we went over there and the lady was nice, and the rent
24:08
was $70 bucks a month and there were four of us, so that’s $17.50 a month, plus the
24:14
oil – they had an oil furnace in there.
24:16
But you know it was nice.
24:18
I never had any problem finding a place – those were the only two places.
24:24
Well, I lived in another apartment but I can’t remember the street.
24:28
But yeah, I never had any problems with that.
24:31
Now, in terms of, you mentioned, going to parties, ‘cause I remember you said you
24:35
met up with Charlie Brown, sorry, Charlie White, which is the female at a party.
24:39
Did you go to parties that were integrated?
24:43
When you had a social life, what was that like?
24:44
Well, all
24:47
the time that I was here, not one white person ever invited
24:50
me to a party that I can recall.
24:53
Now I got invited to people’s homes to have a drink, or for dinner,
24:58
to study, or something like that, but not ever once, teammates or
25:02
anyone, ever invited me to a party.
25:04
But, we gave a party every weekend.
25:07
Okay, at your place.
25:09
Yes, on 9th street - 9th street A-GoGo, that’s what we called it.
25:14
So obviously all of the women at our parties were white, well, with the
25:19
exception of 2 or three, because there was – Carol Smith, and there were three or four
25:29
African American women o – one of them lived here in Corvallis and
25:33
one form L.A. and the other one I forget – Sacramento or somewhere.
25:38
But the majority of the women were white women.
25:44
And Loy Peterson, who’s white, he came to one of two of my
25:50
parties early on, and everybody knew him and he didn’t any angst.
25:56
He was from Los Angeles, so he had been around blacks before and played ball,
26:00
and he didn’t have a problem with that.
26:05
And Charlie White – I guess she found out we were having a party and she came
26:08
to one of our parties and introduced herself – I thought she was kidding.
26:11
And we talked – she was from somewhere in Oregon.
26:18
And that was pretty much how our parties were, and like I said
26:22
we gave a party every weekend.
26:24
And we would even host other African American athletes when they came to
26:31
town, if they were staying overnight and we would say, “hey we’re having a
26:33
party, why don’t you guys come over?”
26:35
And they would?
26:37
They didn’t have any place to go either – like Norm said.
26:40
They came over and we became friendly with all the athletes in
26:46
the conference up and down the coast.
26:48
‘Cause when they came up here
26:50
you’d host them
26:51
When we went to Washington, you know, they’d host us.
26:54
And we had a friend form Seattle, went to school at OSU,
27:02
and she would always have us over to her place and stuff
27:05
. Sure, sure
27:06
And we’d go to Portland every now and then
27:11
What was the relationship like with the police, when you guys had these parties?
27:14
Was there any kind of…?
27:14
I don’t remember the police ever coming to our house
27:18
well, that’s good
27:18
I really don’t, I
27:23
don’t remember
27:25
And what about fraternities, that’s always been a sore point for a lot of
27:29
students, dealing with fraternities
27:31
I think I got a feel from a couple of fraternities, who they were,
27:35
I don’t recall – but that wasn’t anything I wanted to do on any campus.
27:41
I’d been in the military and I’d lived in the barracks and all that stuff with guys
27:45
and I didn’t want – I had my fill of that – I didn’t want to do any more of that
27:50
was I was thinking was more the tension that occurs, because fraternity boys
27:54
‘cause I was thinking that they were down on athletes in all of the negative ways
27:58
I think I got feeled out by a couple of
28:06
people - “nah, not interested”
28:08
Okay.
28:09
Can you now talk a little bit about going through school – you said your classes
28:14
went well – what did you end up as a major and where did you do on from there?
28:20
Well I
28:23
majored in Business Administration with a concentration in
28:27
Personnel – Industrial Relations – I
28:33
started here in September of ’64 and I graduated in December of ’67 [coughing]
28:37
Have some water, that’s what it’s there for
28:46
So
28:50
I left here in ’67,
28:57
so I got a job with a company called Crown-Zellerbach which
29:02
was one of the largest paper manufacturing firms on the West Coast.
29:07
And I got that through
29:11
one of the alumni – a guy who had played here with Paul and
29:17
he worked for Crown-Zellerbach.
29:19
Now at that time, Affirmative Action was big, really big.
29:28
Any black college graduate could find a job,
29:34
whether you were qualified or not and sad to say some were not qualified.
29:38
And I got a job with Crown-Zellerbach and my specific job was
29:43
to integrate the workforce
29:45
At this company
29:46
This was in Antioch, California which was about as racist as you could get.
29:51
Really?
29:52
Antioch is right next to Pittsburg, California.
29:56
Now those two places - 99.9% of all African Americans in that
30:03
area live in Pittsburgh and all the whites live in Antioch
30:06
I didn’t know that, okay
30:07
Now when I went down looking for a place to stay, people would open
30:13
the door and slam it in my face or some wouldn’t open the door.
30:17
So I went into Pittsburg and I found this apartment house over there which was
30:27
not a very nice place.
30:29
But anyway, I got hired to integrate the workforce and I did a pretty
30:36
good job, it was really interesting.
30:39
They wanted African-American and they wanted more women.
30:44
Now this is a manufacturing facility.
30:47
Now they had women working already there, but of course the
30:50
women could only do certain jobs
30:52
secretaries
30:54
Well working in the factory – packing, you know, they couldn’t work in shipping.
31:02
They had one female lift truck driver, maybe two.
31:07
They couldn’t operate the machines, which paid the most money.
31:11
So they were pretty much the lower level, the packing of
31:14
boxes and that sort of thing.
31:17
That’s the way it was at that time with them also.
31:20
So you now I would hire people, I would go out in the neighborhood to Pittsburg where
31:25
African Americans were and Hispanics, they didn’t have a lot of Hispanics
31:28
working there either - so I’d go out and get about 10 or 12 people to come in.
31:32
And at that time they had people do all this different testing: MMPI
31:39
– that took forever.
31:40
And all of that crap.
31:44
So anyway, we got rid of that at some point.
31:46
So I had 12-15 people in the room taking this test so I’d help them with it ‘cause
31:51
I was trying to get people in there.
31:53
And I started doing that and I tell you the people who worked at that
31:57
facility, they hated every bit of it.
31:59
Yeah
32:00
Now there were probably 10 or 12 black people working there and they had been
32:05
working there for quite some time – I mean they weren’t new people – I don’t
32:09
think they had a black person hired probably in the last 10 years or so,
32:13
but I started filling them up with African American, Hispanics, and females.
32:20
And, oh, they hated it.
32:24
The established people there, I’d bring the people out to the
32:28
department, to the supervisor, and the workers would just stare at me.
32:36
I got some bad mail in my inbox, you know, about affirmative action, and one
32:43
guy was going to put a George Wallace bumper sticker on my car and I stopped him
32:50
it was bad.
32:53
I wanna come back though to one part of your story – you actually
32:56
got elected – you got an award here at OSU – a leadership award?
33:01
I think
33:04
it was 65-66?
33:05
How did that feel?
33:06
That felt great.
33:08
Tell me what happened?
33:10
Well, Paul made me the captain
33:12
What was that like?
33:15
It surprised me.
33:16
And I didn’t feel any angst from the team.
33:21
I wasn’t a yeller and a screamer anyway.
33:24
Not like Paul, Paul was a yeller – but I would tell guys,
33:28
we would have a dialogue: “I’m
33:34
gonna do this, why don’t you do that?” And they’d come down here “why don’t
33:38
we make sure we do this?” That was it – it wasn’t like “I’m this and
33:45
you’re that” – It was, “We need to stop these guys and this is what we need
33:50
to do” And Paul used to always say, in the huddle, “This, this, and this”
33:54
but when we broke the huddle he would
34:00
say, “but you gotta play the situation” ‘cause it may not come
34:04
that way so you gotta be waiting for anything – and that’s what I’d say too.
34:08
They may not go this way, they may come this way, or do this.
34:12
And yeah, I felt good about that.
34:14
I really did, yeah,
34:18
and he felt good about it too – Paul and I had a special relationship
34:23
that was making you the captain, but I am more interested in reflecting on the
34:26
student leadership award that you won
34:27
No, the leadership I think was just with the team
34:31
Let’s
34:36
come back then to
34:40
the company at Antioch - so was that your job you continued on with?
34:46
I did that for a while and then I wanted to learn some more about
34:52
the business so I took a production
34:57
job.
34:59
Well, let me go back a little bit.
35:01
yeah, sure
35:01
When I was bringing these people in to go to work, they had what they
35:09
called a probationary period, for the new employees, which was only
35:15
30 days, which was not a long time.
35:18
But they were terminating these people almost as fast as I was hiring them
35:24
– after two or three weeks – almost thirty days up and they’d just say “well, they
35:29
just can’t do the job” Now I said, “well, wait a minute, something’s wrong” So, a
35:34
Hispanic gentleman named Leo Mijares – he and I used to talk and he came to me and
35:41
said “they’re not giving these guys a chance – they’re not training them right.
35:44
So after thirty days these people can’t do the job, they are kicking
35:47
them out, so we gotta do something” Well he was a union steward also.
35:53
So I said, “I’ll tell you what we’re gonna do” - We sat down and we made
35:57
up a form that had to be filled out every week, by the supervisor, what
36:06
was taught – and this person, male of female whatever, had to agree.
36:13
So at the end of the week we would sit down with the union steward,
36:16
myself, and the department supervisor, not the guy who trained them, the
36:20
department supervisor, and go over that.
36:23
And if that guy said, nobody told me this, nobody told me that, then we could extend
36:27
his probationary period and then we made sure that they got the correct training.
36:31
We did that on a weekly basis – took a long time, but you know we did it.
36:34
Then we kept starting to be able to retain people, ‘cause you know
36:38
hiring people costs money and it’s a lot of work and you send them for
36:42
physicals and then they kick them out.
36:45
So we did that.
36:47
But then I wanted to expand and I went out in production – worked production
36:52
for a while, shift work, production payroll, more money, you know I was
36:56
learning a little more about the business.
36:58
And then
37:01
the safety manager left and I decided I had enough of shift work, so I
37:11
decided to go back in the personnel office, since I got my pay scale up
37:14
and I went back in as a safety manager.
37:17
I worked there for 8 years
37:21
during all this time.
37:24
Then I had an opportunity to go with a large construction firm
37:27
called LoneStar Industries which
37:32
covered five states: California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Hawaii.
37:39
And
37:42
I was regional safety manager which was a big job – they give you a car and you
37:47
get to travel a lot, so I took that job
37:50
Did you have a family at that point?
37:53
Yeah, I had one son.
37:54
I had a son in
37:58
1970
37:59
Did you ever have any aspirations of becoming a coach?
38:01
Because, I mean, after you leave basketball, a lot of guys kind of may
38:05
have that aspiration, saying “Hey you now I can probably do some of this stuff”
38:09
Well you know, I help coach the freshman here a little bit, you know,
38:16
right after I stopped playing – and
38:21
I guess the reason I didn’t stay in coaching, I wanted
38:24
to get back to California.
38:26
So I thought the quickest way for me to get back was to pursue my degree.
38:32
But otherwise, I thought about it afterwards, but not right afterwards,
38:35
but maybe 10 years afterwards.
38:38
But I was very disappointed when Paul quit
38:41
1970?
38:42
Yeah, he only had the head coaching job for 6-7 years – he just gave it
38:47
up and I was really disappointed.
38:48
Did you ever talk to him about why that was?
38:50
‘cause we didn’t
38:51
Well, I don’t know that he’d want
38:56
that
38:56
Yeah, sure.
38:57
Now, in terms of your connection back to Detroit, it sounds like that got severed
39:03
a long time ago and that you never really had the aspiration to go back
39:07
Not to live, no
39:08
You kept your family back there
39:11
But what happened is, 5-6 of my nieces and nephews came to
39:16
California, but only one stayed.
39:19
They all came and went to Los Angeles and stayed a while, but one stayed
39:23
and still is in California, but the rest of them all went back to Detroit.
39:29
Other than my nephew here, they’re all in Detroit
39:33
So do you have any regular visits?
39:35
Yeah, I do.
39:36
I went back last year twice.
39:39
This year just recently when I was in Las Vegas my nephew graduated
39:43
so a bunch of them came out, so we had a nice little family reunion.
39:47
I’m going back in August, one of my nieces is getting married,
39:51
so I’m gonna go back for that.
39:53
But I’m gonna be out of there before winter [laughing] . Yeah, I went back
39:56
last September and stayed two weeks
39:59
Carry on the story a little bit further: you finished working 8 years or so
40:06
you said in Antioch, then you went on to the supervisor position, personnel
40:13
Regional Safety Manager
40:14
What else did you do after that?
40:14
Well I worked at that for a while and then that company got bought
40:19
up and they began to downsize so I went to work for a shopping
40:25
mall, I was the safety director up
40:29
near San Francisco.
40:31
And I worked there for quite a few years and then I got into contract security
40:41
– ran a contract security firm in Oakland.
40:43
I was the branch manger there for [’92] 12 years.
40:53
And then just before I was thinking about retiring, I went to work for Bayer
40:57
Bayer, the aspirin company?
40:59
Yes.
41:01
And I worked for them in Berkeley for two years and then I finally retired in 2004
41:06
Okay, nice
41:07
But then I got bored.
41:10
So 2006 rolls around and I’m at home and I look across the street and I
41:15
see these kids playing basketball.
41:16
It was a school for mentally challenged youth.
41:21
So I went over there, you know playing basketball, seeing what they were doing.
41:26
The people there were nice, they talked me into driving the school bus, because
41:31
these guys were pretty hard and they had a lot of female drivers – these
41:34
guys they were tough on the women.
41:36
So I did that for 3 ½ years and I enjoyed it.
41:39
Then finally I just gave it up.
41:42
Now coming back to playing ball though, or not just playing ball, but after
41:47
you left Oregon State, did you ever sort of just play or keep working or
41:52
any of those kinds of things with ball?
41:53
I played for, not AAU, but I played for different teams
41:58
all over Northern California
42:04
- it was quite a network of teams.
42:08
Sacramento used to have the March of Dimes tournament, Lake Tahoe
42:12
had a tournament, they had a little tournament down below Monterrey in
42:17
a little town called Gonzalez, which was a ‘burb but it was a real popular
42:22
tournament, lot of ex-college players, used see them all the time down there.
42:27
You know, somebody would call me in the middle of the week and say “hey, we got
42:30
a game up in Sacramento” and I’d jump in my car after work, and Sacramento
42:34
is a 1 ½ away and I’d play a whole lot. I don’t remember when I stopped
42:40
playing organized, but I played a lot.
42:43
Must be hard not to play
42:45
Yeah, it was just something I did.
42:50
So, you know, wherever I went, one of the first things I did was find out where the
42:55
guys played ball and I went over there.
42:59
When I got out of college, we had a company team down at Crown-Zellerbach.
43:07
There were a lot of large companies out there, DuPont, Dow, US Steel, you
43:14
something like that, they all had teams.
43:16
And we had a good league.
43:17
We played in the league and it was good we had a lot of fun doing that.
43:21
Now we were in Antioch and those teams were mostly integrated and we never had
43:28
any incidents playing ball but you know, trying to do something in town initially
43:36
took a lot before they loosened up.
43:38
And I got to meet several policemen down there and I used
43:43
to hang out at the cop bar so
43:48
everything was cool you know.
43:50
‘Cause I had hired some of these policemen’s kids where
43:52
I worked for the summers
43:53
and they appreciated it …those were
43:58
good jobs
43:59
Oh yeah - they worked and so, you know, it was pretty good
44:04
Now looking back on leaving Oregon State, did you ever have any aspirations
44:07
of going on to play professional ball?
44:09
Well, I did, I wanted to play, but I didn’t get drafted, and I didn’t want
44:16
to go take a chance and not make it when I hadn’t finished school yet.
44:21
Now had they had the teams that they have now all over the world in Europe and where
44:28
else you want – they have teams everywhere
44:30
they sure do
44:31
I probably could have gotten a job somewhere because my nephew went down
44:38
and played in Argentina for 13 years, so I could have probably, but that wasn’t
44:43
available to us at the time I came out.
44:46
And I probably would have jumped at that if I knew that I could go
44:50
play for a couple of years in Europe or somewhere – make a little money
44:52
and I could come back and finish
44:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you really put school as a
44:56
priority, which is a great thing
45:00
Natalia, are there any other questions you want to ask at this
45:03
point, ‘cause I think we’re sort of at the end of what I had to ask.
45:07
Anything that you can think of form the archives perspective
45:09
that you wanted to ask?
45:09
Well you mentioned Harry Gunner, so when he came on the team,
45:14
was that the ’65-66 season?
45:16
Did that change the dynamic at all?
45:18
Was that nice to have another?
45:20
Oh yeah it was nice, plus he helped us a lot, we needed his
45:25
size and strength, and you know, he didn’t start, but he played a lot.
45:31
He was our 6th man and he was the first guy off the bench, usually.
45:40
And now, it’s really funny, Harry and I didn’t always room together – Loy and I
45:45
used to room together most of the time, but you’d always find the three of us in
45:51
one of our bedrooms because we were close.
45:54
Loy used to hang with us.
45:57
Loy hated this place; he hated every bit of it, coming from Los Angeles.
46:04
And he was one of those players that was a playground player ‘cause he’d been
46:10
playing with black kids all his life.
46:12
He had more moves I’m telling you then a can of worms as
46:15
they say and he could play.
46:17
But he and Paul, they never got together for his three years here.
46:24
Now, he went on to play professional – he played in Chicago.
46:28
And
46:30
he married a girl from Madras, Oregon,
46:35
but he hated Oregon when he came up here.
46:40
And he and Paul – they just never got along - never.
46:46
I mean they would glare at each other in practice and on the bench.
46:49
And
46:52
Loy was a hell of a player
46:55
Now in the movie “Glory Road” there was actually eventually some tension that
46:59
occurred between the players, just about black and white issues – they saw the
47:03
black players as taking their spots.
47:05
Did you ever get any kind of feeling like that?
47:09
No
47:10
Just so few of you anyway
47:12
Well, first there was just me, no I never did.
47:17
I’ve never felt that anywhere and nobody definitely never said it to me
47:26
Anything else?
47:27
Well I want to thank you very, very much – it was a great interview and it
47:30
lasted exactly, almost 45 minutes of great stuff, so we really appreciate that
47:35
I gotta go pick up Paul; he’s probably chopping at the bit.
47:38
Well, I’m really sorry about the other one going a little bit long
47:41
Yeah, okay
47:43
Are you gonna be seeing Paul?
47:45
Can I give you his plaque?
47:46
Sure
