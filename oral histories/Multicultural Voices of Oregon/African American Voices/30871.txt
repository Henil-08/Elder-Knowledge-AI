00:01
It February 9th, 2012.
00:03
This is Jean Moule, in her second interview.
00:08
First of all I’d like to talk about how I went about getting
00:12
ready for this interview.
00:17
I did four drafts, started with a list of everything I wanted to consider and
00:21
then ended up with a six page draft that will be the basis of my interview today.
00:27
Started with categories and then decided to go with chronology.
00:31
For the chronology I used my résumé because these professional activities
00:37
prefigured my work at OSU, and is the underlying reason for these interviews.
00:43
But at the same time if I look at my life, my family, and other activities
00:48
are so strong, and of course they greatly influenced my work at OSU.
00:55
So then I went to the yearly reports we had as a family since my
01:02
husband and I were first married.
01:05
Also yesterday as I was getting ready, I created an overlapping timeline that
01:10
had where we lived, what my husband was doing, when my children were born, what
01:15
they were doing, where my schooling was, what churches we went too, my hobbies,
01:21
my interests and, then specifically, areas where I was learning to write
01:28
and writing, teaching in various manners and serving in leadership.
01:33
So that timeline is also in front of me as we do this.
01:38
I will be quoting some of the family letters as we go on and
01:43
these letters, most of them, are already in the OSU collection.
01:49
I think the one thing I do have to make clear here: I teach religion in the
01:54
public schools and in my classes at OSU.
01:58
One of the lectures I had is called “Religion in the Public Schools” which
02:03
is based on the fact, that as agents of the state, educators must be wholesomely
02:08
neutral. And so in those contexts we must be open to our students but yet
02:17
not directive and putting on them our beliefs. Yet at the same time when
02:23
we’re talking about my life during these years, my faith is paramount.
02:29
So, those pieces are going to come out strongly from this and I just want
02:33
to make it clear that I’m doing this because it’s my life and my history and
02:37
what’s influenced me and it wouldn’t be what I teach in front of a classroom.
02:43
So that’s that.
02:44
I would like to start with a verse that is actually in the acknowledgement of
02:47
my dissertation: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on
02:53
your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall
02:58
direct your path.” It’s Proverbs 3:5-6.
03:03
I think you can already see from my first interview and certainly in this
03:07
one, that it’s not as if I decided when I was a little girl that I was going
03:10
to quote unquote “be a professor at OSU.” So I see that verse is really
03:16
undergirding how my path took me to OSU and this interview will make some of those
03:27
junctures and choices come to the fore.
03:30
Okay, also I have decided not to talk in much detail about intense personal
03:37
relationships of either a spiritual nature, nor positive or negative
03:42
interactions with others in great detail.
03:45
I may refer to certain insights, friction or incompatibility and
03:48
leave it at that, there are a few.
03:50
But I’ve decided not to go into those kinds of things in detail and let it go.
03:55
I plan to cover my life and work from my graduation from Cal
03:59
Berkeley until about a year before I entered OSU as a doctoral student.
04:05
Family wise, this is the time from two years into my marriage until all of
04:10
our children had grown and left home, yet before any of them had married
04:14
or started families of their own.
04:18
We left the last interview with a bit of insight into my
04:22
married life with Robert Moule.
04:24
I’m now going to back a bit to, in time, to my graduation from Cal Berkeley and
04:29
my professional journey from that point.
04:33
I graduated from Berkeley in 1967 with an art major and psychology minor.
04:41
And it’s clear to me that both of those things are woven through my work and
04:47
career before OSU and my time at OSU.
04:51
I entered directly into a very competitive teacher education program.
04:56
I believe it was the first masters of arts in teaching [MAT] program in the nation.
05:02
It included my masters degree, my teaching license, and the first year of
05:09
teaching in the Berkeley school district.
05:11
Now the Berkeley school district was extremely difficult to get into.
05:15
There were two hundred and fifty applicants per open position.
05:21
So to have a program that did all of that and also had you starting
05:27
as a first year teacher in the school district was amazing.
05:31
I believe that I was very young.
05:36
I was just, I entered college at age 17 so four years later I was 21.
05:43
And I believe that my race came into some of the problems that happened right away.
05:54
First, it was an intense program from the beginning.
05:59
I remember I had a fellow student in the program whose husband had taken
06:06
her to the emergency room several times because she was so tense she
06:12
was bound up into a fetal position and he went there to give her shots
06:16
so she would relax - she was that bad.
06:19
That’s an example of how intense this program was.
06:23
I was the only African American in the program and even though I had
06:28
a solid B average when I graduated, I believe most of the others in the
06:32
program had a higher GPA and that my race may have tilted my acceptance.
06:39
I also was placed with another intern for this program who
06:47
was not a good fit for me.
06:49
And we two, as far as I could tell, were the ones on the
06:54
radical/reformer side of the cohort.
06:57
Most people had a more traditional viewpoint, had seen teaching as something
07:04
they wanted to do for a long time.
07:06
But we were...this was not very long after the Free Speech Movement and I
07:11
was really into making a difference.
07:14
And I think that she and I were on the left side of the cohort as we came in.
07:23
Then, because of my race, I believe I was purposely placed in a very
07:28
diverse setting, which I had very little experience in before this time.
07:36
My own upbringing was diverse.
07:39
The schools I was placed in they were probably in the flatlands
07:41
of Berkeley, they were probably eighty, ninety percent black.
07:52
And I had asked for a kindergarten class; I always liked little kids.
07:57
I was placed in sixth grade.
08:00
And I know I had at least one kid in the class that was criminally
08:06
minded because he had actually pulled a knife on someone in a park.
08:10
This is not an easy group to work with.
08:13
I remember one time, I was in front of the class and I turned around to say something
08:17
and I caught a spitball in my mouth.
08:20
This gives you some idea of the tension that we were on.
08:23
And, I left that that program.
08:26
Now I’m certain that that experience gave me a depth of understanding for that
08:30
OSU MAT program that we had, and I may talk about that, in the next interview.
08:37
But that was my beginning of my efforts to become a teacher.
08:45
Could you talk a bit about why you decided to become a teacher after having
08:51
the art major and psychology minor?
08:54
I heard you say the idea of making a difference?
09:01
Well, you can see that I’m a very curious person.
09:06
And I think that teaching gave me a reason to explore and learn more.
09:13
I could see that happening.
09:15
I also thought that it would be good to influence the young people because I
09:22
had a strong care for the environment.
09:26
I had some really I’d think you’d call it: anti-capitalistic, real
09:32
values, not things that were connected to material possessions.
09:38
And I wanted to
09:43
give those to children.
09:46
I think that’s part of what happened.
09:49
I started taking a few education classes before I graduated, so it wasn’t brand
09:56
new, the idea of being a teacher.
09:58
I had taken a music class and
10:04
I forget some of the other classes, but on my transcript, my senior
10:07
year, you can see a few of those pre-education classes I had taken.
10:16
All right so here we are 1968.
10:18
It’s a very emotional time to leave a program you’ve invested so much
10:24
into; it was not an easy decision.
10:28
I struggled one way or another.
10:30
I can remember teachers at the school and some of the people I was working
10:35
with making an effort to try to bridge it for me so it would work.
10:40
But I just saw I was probably too inexperienced and not ready
10:47
to undertake that kind of work.
10:50
So what was I going to do now?
10:52
So, my husband was still in school.
10:56
He was working on his masters degree in history.
11:01
He was working as a teamster to get his...to support us while he
11:09
was going to San Francisco State and I started working three jobs.
11:13
And I see value in all of them.
11:15
I worked at a pizza joint as a waitress one day a week, sometimes other days.
11:22
I began to see that particular career from that viewpoint of actually
11:26
being in it and I still value that.
11:28
I worked as a seamstress for a man who was both a jeweler and sold
11:35
leather goods out of his office.
11:38
That didn’t work out very well.
11:40
And I also worked as a researcher in the psychology department of Cal. Do
11:46
you remember the days when you did punch cards and you had a stack of the cards
11:52
and you’d walk them over to the computer?
11:54
You wouldn’t remember those days.
11:56
You walk those clear across campus, this stack of cards you gave it to them.
12:01
Then the next morning you’d get your cards back and you’d get your key punch cards
12:06
back and you would get your print out.
12:08
Well that’s what I did for awhile, punching those cards.
12:11
And I think it’s so funny punching those cards thing this laptop over
12:14
here probably has more computing power, than that huge building on campus did.
12:21
That was for a psychologist who was in family counseling, his name was Jensen.
12:30
Right about then both my husband and I got jobs as testers for
12:35
the Berkeley school district.
12:38
Right before Berkeley was going to be integrated, they wanted to get
12:41
a baseline for all their students.
12:44
We administered multiple kinds of tests; cognitive, achievement, self
12:51
concept, for grades kindergarten though twelfth grade in all income
12:59
levels, in all different demographics.
13:02
From the lowlands in Berkeley, that were predominantly poorer and black
13:08
to the hills in Berkeley that were predominantly white and wealthy.
13:14
It was a fascinating time.
13:15
And I think that work influenced me for what I did next and at OSU because
13:23
I saw dozens and dozens of classrooms and teachers, saw just a little bit
13:29
about how different teachers related.
13:32
The
13:34
testing was completely randomized.
13:37
We didn’t know until the morning where we were going to test, what
13:41
level, what tests we were going to do.
13:43
We were very well trained to tell exactly the same thing to every class
13:49
so it was as controlled as possible.
13:53
I learned some things about research then by being actually a researcher gathering
14:00
the raw data as a tester of that study.
14:06
Right around then, with my no longer in the teaching program, and Robbie having
14:16
finished his masters, but no longer in a job, we did a bit of dropping out.
14:23
We sold everything we had or gave it away.
14:26
We lived in a forest camp with some others that sort of focused on taking a sauna,
14:33
going for a swim, maybe making a trip into a local town to go dumpster diving for
14:38
fresh vegetables and other food we could find [laughs] . So we did that for a few
14:43
months and during the end of that time, I did go back and do another series of
14:50
testing for the Berkeley school district.
14:53
About then we headed with nothing on our agenda or specifically planned,
15:01
we headed to Stockton to live for six months with Robbie’s parents
15:07
[while there Robbie worked as a substitute teacher and I worked in
15:08
the library at the University of the Pacific where his father, Malcolm
15:09
Moule taught in the history department.
15:09
I was also in a Reader’s Theater there] . Based on his masters degree
15:12
from San Francisco State, where he was writing papers in German into
15:17
the wee hours of the morning, Robbie tried to get a history job teaching at
15:23
community colleges on the west coast.
15:25
We had the wall of our [Stockton] bedroom covered with his rejection letters.
15:29
Did get a couple of interviews and we did drive as far as Washington state
15:34
from the bay area for these interviews.
15:38
And he applied to everything that was in an area we thought we’d like to live.
15:44
Finally, with no job referring and coming and nothing else planned, we decided we
15:55
would just go to a place that we loved.
15:59
Now, we had seen Oregon; we liked the outdoorsy nature of it.
16:05
In some ways, we knew very little about the state and we were invited
16:09
here by some people we had met in Berkeley and they lived near
16:18
Silverton.
16:18
Now when we moved to Oregon, I was already carrying our first child.
16:27
So from 1969 to1974, specifically, we embarked on what I called in my
16:34
résumé, the Moule Enterprises: producers and educators of three children.
16:43
We lived near Silver Falls State Park, where Robbie worked for
16:47
awhile and all three children were born in Silverton Hospital.
16:52
Mary Ellen Moule was born on December 29, 1969 named after both her grandmothers.
17:01
While I was expecting her, we lived in a picker shed.
17:04
It was....Robbie was doing agricultural work by the piece.
17:10
It
17:13
was a long building divided into four cabins and we lived in one end of it.
17:18
It had running water but no indoor toilet.
17:23
And we weren’t there very long because there were people that he was
17:27
meeting through working in the woods who began to be a little concerned
17:33
about this young woman, pregnant, and living in a situation like that.
17:38
So there was a time that I was invited to a tea, a neighborhood tea.
17:50
And I remember the electricity in the cabin was on and off and it had
17:55
stopped and my clock was an hour late.
17:58
So I arrived at this tea an hour late and everyone made a big deal of when I
18:03
got there, so “Oh Jean, you’re here!” And there was another young woman, the one
18:08
who had invited us to Oregon, she also was there, and she was also pregnant.
18:14
Anyway so we sit down and we drinking our tea and someone
18:20
brings a gift, a box over to me.
18:24
And I go “What’s this?” and they go, “Open it!” I go, “Okay” and then as
18:29
more boxes came, I understood that this was a surprise baby shower for me.
18:37
Now these are people that I hardly know at all and there was one gift that was,
18:45
I still have it, it was a handmade baby quilt with blocks on it that
18:54
were handmade crossed stitched, I mean obviously a lot of hours went into this.
19:00
And I think that was the first time I understood the love part of Christianity.
19:09
Here you have a couple, interracial, everybody else is white here, by the
19:15
way the first time we went to vote [laughs] it wasn’t too long after this.
19:20
I go to the voting place and they have a stack of the ballots primary
19:24
for Republicans and Democrats.
19:28
As you know, we’re both so far left that Democrats and
19:31
Republicans were both on the right.
19:35
And here’s this stack and there’s like an inch of Democratic ballots
19:40
and a foot of Republican ballots.
19:42
And I went, “Oh my gracious!” because I really didn’t understand the
19:46
politics of the community we were in.
19:50
But the love they showed me there transcended it all.
19:56
And I believe that was a time we may have started attending the Chapel
20:04
in the Hills, where most of the people were working who had given us
20:10
the baby shower had been attending.
20:26
During these years, caring for children, first, two, then three, under five years
20:33
old, this greatly influenced what I did.
20:37
For example, because of Robbie’s work teaching English to the Valley Migrant
20:41
League, I worked there for two years in the summer, in 1971 to 1972, as director
20:49
and supervisor in Jefferson, Oregon.
20:53
During that time, I hired and managed a staff of 17, planned the
20:58
schedule, the budget, and training.
21:00
The second year I stepped down as director and supervised the nursery
21:04
while I was nursing my second child.
21:07
And I remember beginning to understand the Latino/Latina culture then.
21:12
For example, the fact that the parents always expected you to
21:16
touch the child when he or she was brought in to the nursery.
21:23
During the rest of the year I was still working towards my teaching
21:28
license, from Mt Angel College.
21:30
I went to classes with Mary in a backpack, student taught in
21:34
Silverton Hills while very pregnant.
21:38
First graders never said a thing.
21:40
Then I had Michael Mountain Moule on December 12th.
21:44
He was named after Judy Collins’ top song “Michael from Mountain,
21:51
Where Will You Go To?” So this time, at Mt Angel College and work at the Valley
21:57
Migrant League happened at the same time, and I only did things that would
22:05
work well with raising the children.
22:11
Robbie had now worked for the Oregon Parks at Silver Falls for
22:16
a short time before he began to work with Avery Property in Lyons.
22:22
This lead to our move to Lyons in 1974, not too long before the birth of Matthew
22:30
Malcolm Moule on July 2nd and he’s named after both of his grandfathers.
22:41
While we were living near Silver Falls
22:45
State Park, before we talk about my move to Lyons, I was thinking about how,
22:54
I think it was Josie and Homer Rice, would make such an effort to make sure
22:59
that we were part of the community.
23:03
I remember that Josie would be at my house when I first brought home my babies.
23:10
There was Kelly Kenagy who, with Josie and her family, had started
23:16
the little Chapel in the Hills.
23:18
Kelly had helped Robbie get started working in the woods.
23:23
There were these connections, both social and Christian and work related, that built
23:33
up and had that basis at Silverton Hills.
23:37
The other thing that happened during that time is that I was
23:43
student teaching, as I mentioned, in Silver Crest Elementary School.
23:50
It was such a different situation.
23:52
It was a very small school.
23:54
There were two grades per room.
23:59
And I student taught with one woman who was not only the 1st and 2nd grade
24:05
teacher and she was also the principal.
24:09
And the time when I was student teaching, I remember, I had twenty one first graders
24:18
facing one direction and twelve second graders facing the other direction.
24:26
So here you had 33 students in two grades.
24:30
And I don’t know how she could do the principal-ship too while
24:33
she did it, but she managed it.
24:36
I just have a video somewhere of myself waddling, ‘cause I finished
24:41
the student teaching and I finished my reflections and my second child
24:46
was born a week later [laughs] . I mean I was very very pregnant.
24:52
It was just hilarious to think about some of the things that happen.
24:56
Like I’d be teaching the first grade class and I’d see the second graders
25:02
over lining up at the pencil sharpener just smiling, not being really naughty,
25:08
but knowing they were not doing what they were supposed to be doing.
25:11
And that would happen when I was being observed for this time by a
25:15
wonderful nun from Mt Angel College.
25:18
She was my supervisor for this time.
25:24
And she was a kick, a lot of fun.
25:29
So, it was my first...it was a very different student teaching situation
25:36
from the one in Berkeley though.
25:38
And I think that the children from the farms and the rural
25:45
community...the parents were
25:52
more closely connected to what was happening.
25:55
But I also remember that before we moved to Lyons, there came an opening
26:05
at the school and I decided to apply and I had just had my second child.
26:13
So I had a two year old and a child that was a few months old.
26:17
And when I went before the school board, for the interview, I remember they said,
26:23
“We really don’t think you should be teaching, you should be home with your
26:26
babies.” Which of course, now you can’t make those kinds of decisions. But I
26:32
think that looking back on it that was one of those situations, where they weren’t
26:40
sure they wanted an African American teaching in their all white school anyway.
26:45
So was that one of those cases where someone gives you another reason that
26:51
has nothing to do with race, when underlying it there is another reason?
26:56
I mean to a certain extent we all do that when invited somewhere.
27:00
If we have something else to go to, we say that.
27:04
Underneath, we didn’t want to go anyway.
27:05
So I understand that.
27:07
But it in this situation
27:11
it’s troublesome, because did I or did I not take it personally?
27:17
Did I see the racial implications at that time?
27:20
And I’m not sure I did.
27:22
But I remember sort of feeling disenfranchised for being a mother
27:30
if not because of my race [laughs]
27:34
. So we moved to our new town, Lyons, and became involved very quickly.
27:43
We stopped going to Chapel in the Hills and started going to the church
27:48
that is right next door to our house.
27:52
During this time in the chronology gets to be a little bit off.
27:57
I started a TOPS chapter that’s “Take Off Pounds Sensibly.” I had been
28:04
at that group in Silverton Hills.
28:07
And of course after having a baby, you start to lose a lot of weight anyway.
28:09
So, I was the yearly queen ‘cause I lost 25 pounds while nursing!
28:14
[laughs] . But I started two chapters, one in Lyons and later one in Stayton.
28:20
I started a babysitting co-op, so that we could trade around
28:24
caring for our children.
28:26
Started a Bible study,
28:31
and at some point, started leading singing at the church next door.
28:36
We use to sometimes be greeters of the church, often invited people,
28:44
people who were visiting the church, home to our house for a meal that day.
28:51
I think there was a lot of I would have to call it shallow acceptance of us.
28:59
Because, I remember, there was one woman in the church who was really,
29:09
probably through no fault of her own, she was really unpleasant to be around.
29:14
She had body odor it was very intense, whether it was
29:18
physical or not I don’t know.
29:20
But she was poor, very poor and she
29:30
was intellectually challenged.
29:33
Now, in my understanding to love and reach out to people I worked
29:40
to not let that make a difference.
29:42
But every once in awhile she’d come up to my door and she knock on door and I’d
29:47
say, “Well, Mary, what do you want?”And she’s say, “I just want to come in.”
29:50
So she’d come in and she’d just sit!
29:55
Years later I found out that that was her way of saying she
30:02
accepted me because I was black.
30:04
Was to come in and sit in my house, with no respect that maybe it wasn’t
30:12
maybe something I wanted to do.
30:13
But was her pushing herself, in some ways on me, to prove that she wasn’t racist.
30:20
And of course over the years I’ve experienced that in many different
30:24
forms in many different ways.
30:25
But that was a specific instance that I remember very well.
30:31
There were, we were new in town.
30:34
I was a member of TOPS.
30:36
I was member of Christian Women’s Club, I’ll talk about that a little later.
30:43
And we were members of a church.
30:45
Here we’re having a baby.
30:49
I had three baby showers.
30:52
I received over 70 gifts [laughs] - it was insane.
30:58
I think a lot of it was this welcoming of this new and different family into town.
31:08
Sometime in the early ‘70s I attended Basic Youth, Institute in Basic
31:13
Youth [Conflicts] , and through that week of intense teaching it
31:19
changed my understanding of faith.
31:22
I think that clearly Robbie and I had rejected religion and I think
31:29
that even now that I see a difference between Churchianity and Christianity.
31:34
But that institute lead me to understand scripture in a different way and for years
31:42
afterwards I helped other people go there.
31:45
It was one of my organizing things, as I went through different phrases,
31:49
was to help other people go to this.
31:51
And at that point my life took an evangelical direction; I
31:56
think that is what I would have to talk about, have to call it.
32:00
And beginning of 1974 I worked with Christian Woman’s Club first in Silverton
32:07
before we moved to Lyons and then in Stayton [I was the speaker in CWC’s
32:07
all around Oregon during these years]
32:09
. And
32:13
this [Stayton] group probably averaged 50 to 70 members.
32:19
They had once a month a luncheon; in the luncheon they had some kind of
32:27
program and a soloist and a speaker.
32:31
And it was very low key, not extremely pressure sort of a luncheon.
32:42
During this time I designed the invitations that were sent out;
32:46
I had various offices in the organization including president.
32:52
I remember one time our feature was a
32:57
fashion show, and I was pregnant, this was before Matt was born, I was pregnant
33:02
with him, so I had on this big green polka dot dress and Mary, who was four
33:07
at the time, had a green polka dot dress with a little bonnet that I made her,
33:13
so we were part of the fashion show.
33:19
There was one point that we had a luncheon out here at my house and I
33:25
should not have been both the president and the hostess - it was crazy time.
33:31
We were going for 100 that day so we had both the chairs and tables setup
33:35
outside and it started to rain and so now we had to move all these chairs and
33:40
tables somewhere in my house or onto the porch [laughs] . It was hilarious
33:49
and then we decided we could go back outside for the program and the talk.
33:54
And I’d setup for one of the officers to do her little part of the program
34:02
by mounting one of our horses and riding it into the meeting on a horse,
34:09
and it was really hilarious [laughs]
34:15
. Somewhere in those years, obviously I have three children under five the next years
34:24
were very busy taking care of basic needs, starting school, we were living in Lyons.
34:29
They could walk to school; it was two blocks one direction, the post office
34:33
was one block the other direction.
34:35
I remember my three year old walking down to the post office
34:37
to get the mail during that time.
34:40
We were living in a small town.
34:45
Occasionally I would sit down to write a letter to my friends or family, I
34:51
remember just being really frustrated just didn’t seem like the words were going on
34:56
the papers in the way I wanted them to.
34:59
And I remember just praying “Oh Lord, I would just love to learn
35:03
how to write,” it would be so nice.
35:07
So sometime around there I was in this garage sale, in Lyons
35:11
and I started talking to a woman who worked at the Stayton Mail.
35:17
And she says as we’re talking-and she knew I was college educated-and we’re
35:24
having an interesting conversation going.
35:26
She said, “Well, how would you like to attend the school board meetings and the
35:31
city council meetings in Lyons for us and then you just write it down and send
35:37
it to us.” And I said, “Well that would be fine except I don’t know to write”
35:42
[laughs] . And she said, “Oh no, you can actually call in the details or you can
35:49
just write the statements and we’ll write it to a story.” Well you can imagine
35:56
how much that helped me in my writing.
36:01
I was still typing, this is before we had any electronic ways of changing things.
36:06
I would type them out on newsprint and send them to her and the next
36:11
week I would see how they had taken my notes and made a story out of them.
36:15
So it was a great training ground.
36:17
And over the next few years I continued to write for the Stayton Mail and eventually
36:25
starting writing for the Statesman Journal as both a correspondent for
36:31
the meetings that were going on, but it enlarged, and after awhile, I was writing
36:37
a column for the Statesman Journal called “A Letter from Santiam Canyon.” And I
36:42
first did it with someone and then by myself and it appeared every Thursday.
36:47
And I would do, what was I doing...sampling food at the restaurants,
36:53
talking about the events that were happening, trying to make some humor
36:57
about my family and what it was like to have them home for the summer
37:03
and quoting some of my friends.
37:06
And at the same time in the Stayton Mail I went from writing some stories, I remember
37:14
I wrote something about Jonah and the Whale, I wrote some of my thoughts on
37:27
mostly Christian topics, but also other things that interested me.
37:31
And at one point I actually had a whole page that had interviews with different
37:38
religious leaders in Stayton, and had a cartoon on it, and had a verse.
37:44
And I did that for a few months and went in on Tuesday
37:52
nights to lay out the paper.
37:55
Then you physically had the copy and you physically laid it out and
37:59
took a print and then sent it out.
38:05
I love that aspect of writing and getting into the news and
38:10
being active in the community.
38:12
Sometimes I would do feature articles.
38:14
I did one on a teacher from Fox Valley School here, who was also our neighbor.
38:20
I think that was the only picture I had printed in the -Statesman
38:24
Journal, the only photograph.
38:25
But [at the Stayton Mail] I had dozens and dozens of photographs, sometimes a whole
38:29
page spread had most of my pictures on it.
38:34
Just whatever I could write about.
38:37
I remember writing about visiting the things from King Tut’s
38:42
tomb exhibit when it was up in Seattle in the 1970s.
38:47
Just things that interested me--I tried to turn into a story.
38:50
And what I liked best is that if there was something happening, a
38:54
crowd gathering, I had a really good reason to go and find out what was
38:57
happening because I was a correspondent.
38:59
In
39:01
1976
39:07
to 1979 I became involved with the Mari-Linn Preschool; it was a private
39:12
kindergarten and nursery school that was located in the public school.
39:16
I don’t think they even charged us anything for rent.
39:19
Because the room was there and it served the school to have some kindergarten
39:25
before first grade, and this was before kindergarten was mandated
39:29
throughout the state of Oregon.
39:31
And I provided administration for three classes.
39:36
It was a staff of three; I wrote the curriculum and I taught and I also shared
39:44
the kindergarten class with someone else and then taught one class of preschool
39:49
students, nursery students, and someone taught another group of nursery students.
39:55
I was teaching three days a week and then I worked doing
40:00
the curriculum for all of us.
40:02
During this time Matt, who was two, the woman who baby sat him was also
40:09
sitting one of the children in the nursery school so she would come and
40:13
pick up that child and deliver my two year old to me, so that was fun.
40:19
And during that time I had my [other] son in my class and he’d call me “Mrs.
40:24
Mommy.” Both of the younger two children were involved in that and as you can
40:30
see being in the preschool made sense because of the age of my kids it fit.
40:37
And I also liked being in a school where my daughter was going to
40:40
school so I’d hang out in the lounge and I’d find out the background.
40:44
During this time, I believe, my husband [and
40:49
I] , we started a Parent Teachers Association and Robbie
40:53
was the first PTA president.
40:57
Now, I have one of my lectures that I always use about religion in the public
41:04
schools and I talk about different things that happened during my years as a teacher
41:11
and I think I’ll sprinkle those through this interview, we’ll see how that goes.
41:15
One of them was that in this class I had on my wall sayings that I wanted
41:22
my children to know, like “A person is known by the friends he or she
41:28
keeps.” Now, that’s a proverb, it is from the Bible. It’s not particularly
41:34
religious, but it is from the Bible.
41:38
Some of them were not, some of them were.
41:41
I had a parent come in and notice that one was in fact from the Bible and
41:47
she asked, “Is that legal?” And so,
41:53
that question, which I’ll get back to another time, came then: “Is it legal
42:03
to have sayings on the board from different faiths and from secular places?”
42:11
And the answer is that “Yes, it is.”
42:13
So that was the first time
42:19
my faith and my public school, it was in a public school, came into conflict
42:27
in a way that I had to think about.
42:29
And so I have a very deep and long understanding about religion in public
42:34
school and holding some neutrality.
42:36
A lot of that began then.
42:40
I also, during that time, I remember I had a student in a
42:44
kindergarten class who wouldn’t talk.
42:47
And I remember spending so much time just trying to get a few words out of him as
42:54
if he was one member of the whole class.
42:57
Well there was another member of the class that entered kindergarten reading
43:03
and I didn’t even know it until December.
43:07
And I think that’s when it first occurred to me that I was certainly
43:12
taking care of special needs child as much as possible but here the bright
43:17
child was learning virtually nothing.
43:20
I’m teaching sounds of the letter and how to say “mmmm mat” and
43:26
he’s already reading. And so, I saw that I was doing him a disservice. And I think
43:30
that’s one of the things that starting cluing me into talented and gifted
43:33
students even before I understood that my own children were talented and gifted.
43:42
In 1979 right after that I did get involved in Talented and
43:50
Gifted Education for grades 1 to 8 at Mari-Linn school district.
43:55
I set up a pilot program that I did absolutely for free as I began to
44:01
work with students that were bright.
44:04
I wrote grants.
44:05
I served students in all areas of giftedness not only academic
44:11
but also leadership, art, drama, calligraphy, creativity.
44:19
We had a list of areas that were considered gifted education
44:24
and I worked to do them all.
44:26
We had a newspaper.
44:28
I remember one time we had a, it was very unfortunate, one of the
44:33
little kids in my kindergarten class was hit by a car and died.
44:40
And our class, the leadership class, wanted to do something so
44:47
that that wouldn’t happen again.
44:49
He had been riding on the side of the road.
44:51
So we wrote a proposal to the Oregon Department of Transportation that
44:56
a bike path be put into Lyons.
45:00
And we sent off this letter and we heard nothing back.
45:05
Actually, no, I take that back.
45:07
This guy from the department came to talk to my class but after that we heard
45:12
nothing back until one day we’re sitting in class and we look outside and here’s
45:16
all this heavy duty equipment rolling into town, these big trucks and stuff,
45:22
[laughs] and they put in a bike path, a fifty thousand dollar bike path,
45:26
because of the students’ original letter.
45:29
So that was one of those times when a little bit of effort by some
45:35
children opened up a very big and wonderful service to a lot of people.
45:44
I think that was one of the first times I understood the power of kids and the
45:49
power of teachers to influence kids for that kind of work that addresses
45:56
a real need and a real audience.
46:01
During this time I had a couple of, another one of my little
46:08
religion public school things.
46:10
I had a little kid that fell down and scratched his knee
46:15
and I come up to him and he’s holding his knee and he’s praying.
46:18
Okay, he was asking Jesus to heal him.
46:21
And I remember looking around and there was no one else there.
46:24
I knew his parents, I had been to his church, it wasn’t my
46:28
church but I knew his church.
46:29
I looked around and I put my hand on his shoulder and I
46:31
started pray with him like that.
46:33
So that’s one of the questions I asked my students later at OSU: was that legal?
46:37
And we’d talk about, and “no” because I was actually practicing my faith.
46:42
But it was just one of those things that happened and seemed very natural
46:47
at the time just go ahead and do it.
46:48
I wasn’t initiating it but
46:54
there are reasons why my publicly praying with a child in a public
47:00
space wouldn’t be a good thing to do.
47:04
At the same time I
47:09
had arranged for, what do you call it when you have children leave to
47:15
go to Bible study outside of school?
47:21
[Release time] Well I started something a little Bible club that
47:23
was after school from two to three.
47:25
And I think a third of the kids in the school were going to it.
47:29
And then we ended up having to do it across the street.
47:34
And I remember inviting an evangelist that was visiting our church came to
47:40
an optional talk with the 7th and 8th graders at Mari-Linn School and it
47:47
was like he kept them for a long time.
47:51
And these teachers didn’t really care that their kids weren’t back in their room.
47:54
But I’m wringing my hands going this is a Church-State issue, he needs to
47:59
be done with them [laughs] . And he was being pretty darn evangelical; that was
48:07
so much so that it made me uncomfortable.
48:09
Because I don’t believe that—teachers, teachers have a captive audience- so you
48:16
have to be careful what you say and do.
48:18
And even though students go to this voluntarily I thought it had
48:22
crossed the line a little bit.
48:25
Now, during this time also, I went to the school board at Mari-Linn
48:33
School and had an ongoing debate about creation and evolution.
48:41
And, while I still have a lot of questions myself, my basic reason for
48:53
having a great deal of trouble with evolution is that it’s illogical.
49:01
I remember when I was substituting once I had a chart that had a scientist in
49:11
a white coat and he has his finger out like that and he goes, “Hydrogen - an
49:19
odorless colorless gas that, given enough time, turns into people.” Now, that’s
49:27
illogical to me. And there are certain laws like entropy and the way things
49:37
break down that are scientific theories that are totally against something
49:45
from nothing. It doesn’t work for me.
49:48
I had another sign that says “Frog
49:55
= Man, Time Instantaneous: Fairy Tale. --- Frog = Man, Time
50:03
Three Million Years: Science.”
50:07
So during this time I felt that any good education should have multiple
50:15
ways of looking at things and that it is only fair that children be allowed
50:21
to look at scientific evidence for
50:29
intelligent design.
50:32
And I still feel that way.
50:35
It’s
50:40
a problematic perspective that flies in the face of unknow [able]
50:44
and unproven theories of evolution.
50:47
So that was one thing that happened during this time that I was
50:52
often in conflict with others.
50:55
I remember I have a whole series of books in my library on the
51:01
scientific basis for creation.
51:06
But I have also found there is this impenetrable wall in most schools
51:13
and certainly in higher education to even begin to discuss it.
51:18
And I am still troubled by that because if it is so obvious,
51:26
then why can’t we talk about it?
51:27
And yet as far as I can see, if you even begin to suggest your work
51:33
is going to support creationism you can’t even get it published.
51:37
Okay
51:39
about that same time I worked a bit in the Santiam Christian School.
51:47
I was working half time at Mari-Linn School and half time at a Christian school
51:54
that had a set up for individualized instruction for grades 1-12.
52:01
Set up the school, trained the aids, and particularly helped a lot with
52:04
the extracurricular activities; helped them get a better view of
52:09
things than just from the church.
52:14
Let’s pause.
52:20
In 1981
52:24
we left that church in Lyons and moved to four acres in the country.
52:28
We had a large garden, horses almost right away, and llamas later.
52:34
Our summers were full of times with the children, family trips.
52:39
The kids were growing up with the horses, the dog, the cats, life happened.
52:45
Our first trip to Europe was five weeks in 1981 right before we moved
52:51
to our current home in the country.
52:54
We visited my husband’s sister in Paris and spent time went across to England
52:58
and Denmark, two of Rob’s close ancestral homes, Germany, Holland, Austria,
53:04
Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg.
53:07
And we began to see, for the first time finally, I was able to get to
53:13
Europe and get off of this continent.
53:18
Shortly thereafter I started as a substitute in school districts.
53:25
Now, this was just a way I thought, since I had my teaching certificate, it gave
53:30
me a little more money into the family.
53:33
I remember it was really a matter of prayer to do this and we had a
53:37
visitor with us who was substituting full time in California and she was
53:42
telling me some of the things she did to work as a substitute teacher.
53:46
And by the way, I was not a good disciplinarian, but I did learn how
53:51
to discipline from substituting.
53:54
I had a little bead chart and I said, “Now everyone in class if you’re sitting
54:00
up straight, I’d move a bead for your row over a little bit.” And everyone sits up.
54:05
“But oh, over there, you were talking to your neighbor I’d move the bead for your
54:09
row back.” And the whole class was focused on this bead chart and the row that did
54:15
the best for the day would get stickers, chocolate, whatever I could think of.
54:21
So I had this, and I’m not saying that’s the best way to discipline
54:24
kids, but that’s how it worked for the substitute teaching.
54:29
Also I was very creative, you know, you’re a substitute teacher they haven’t
54:34
hired you they can’t fire you, so I did some very interesting things there.
54:41
In one class for a month I taught social studies, and it was amazing I was able
54:51
to go before he left and he had a test and then he had to have surgery so I got
54:58
to know the class a little bit and he really trusted me with his class and I
55:02
went all out: I had costumes, I had games.
55:07
One class, two of the, I had both 7th graders and 8th graders
55:12
and one set was studying the
55:18
Egyptians and mentioned their contact with the Hebrews in the teacher’s manual.
55:27
So one day I dressed up like Nefertiti and the kids were watching a film while
55:37
I was putting on makeup in the back of the room and I heard this knocking
55:41
on the door and I opened it and there was the principle and he looked at me
55:47
with my makeup on and my Nefertiti
55:53
outfit and he goes, “Never mind” and shuts the door.
55:58
So I went up to the front and talk about the opening of King Tut’s tomb
56:02
and who knows, like I said I probably didn’t have my timeline right.
56:07
But then I told the students “Okay, tomorrow we have a special guest coming
56:13
and when our guest comes tomorrow,
56:17
you’ll enjoy him so much.” So it was time for him to come and I told the
56:23
students I looked at my watch and said “He’s not here yet, I think I’d better go
56:28
check.” Which you’re not supposed to do.
56:30
So I left the room and I ran down to the teacher’s lounge and I put on this long
56:36
multicolored robe and this great long white beard and came in with a staff in
56:44
one hand and the ten commandments in the other and walked into the room as Moses.
56:51
And, again, now the teacher’s manual said about the contact so
56:54
I was going along with the book.
56:58
So the students are reacting in ways you can’t imagine; I mean one
57:03
comment was, “Moses you sure got a tan wandering around there in the
57:07
dessert.” And I would then talk about the contact between the two cultures.
57:18
And of course at OSU when I tell them that story we talk about
57:24
the legality of that.
57:28
And then for the other set of classes they were learning about
57:33
the colonization of the US.
57:37
So for that I put on a pilgrim costume and I set up the room like a church service.
57:44
And so we’re now going to be thankful for our arriving on the shores.
57:49
So I had the students praising and they actually got into real praise, like I
57:56
went “Oops! Now what am I going to do?”
58:01
And now I got them to praise, and now am I going to denigrate
58:05
religion by stopping them?
58:09
[laughs] Fortunately,
58:12
time was running out.
58:13
I finally got them quieted down and one student comes and says, “Mrs.
58:18
Moule,
58:21
can I talk to the class a minute?” I went “Oh sure!” So the student takes the podium
58:27
and he gives an evangelical message, which isn’t legal and then the bell rings.
58:33
But just talking about these real experiences in my classrooms
58:37
was a way I could bring my real experience to my students at OSU.
58:42
So I was pretty powerful to have those times.
58:46
Funny, Scio Middle School,
58:51
and my prayer for substituting was, “Please Lord not middle school.”
58:54
And these were all middle schools.
58:55
Scio Middle School and Stayton Middle School I was at the top of both lists for
58:59
substituting and when the phone rang in the morning I’d say, “Oh, let it please
59:03
be Scio!” Because when I’d go to Scio I had a little bag that said"Guest Teacher.”
59:08
And the kids were all about “Mrs.
59:09
Moule is here!
59:09
Wow, this is fun, shes going to be here!”
59:13
I’d get up at Stayton Middle School, I’d go to the lobby area
59:18
and there’d be a student who’d say “Oh yuck, here comes Mrs. Moule!”
59:22
It was just like night and day.
59:24
I think from that I learned you can be the same person and be seen so
59:28
differently from such different settings.
59:30
But I learned so much because I was just in dozens and
59:34
dozens of classes for a year.
59:36
Well at the end of a year, I was substitute teaching three
59:43
or four days a week and decided that I might as well take a job.
59:48
So that’s when I applied to work at Mill City Middle School as a coordinator
59:54
for gifted students grades K-12.
59:58
I conducted the identification, led screening committees, consulted with
1:00:02
classroom teachers on individual students’ learning programs, provided or
1:00:06
planned the services, wrote curriculum, taught myself in grades 1-8 gifted.
1:00:16
And during that time I coached first place winners in a state essay
1:00:20
contest, Odyssey of the Mind state and regional competition, and a
1:00:24
western region commercial contest.
1:00:26
I just loved sharing my creativity and getting creativity out of the students.
1:00:31
That was my gift during that time.
1:00:34
It was part of what I love about teaching.
1:00:39
I helped students place art in a Salem paper and it was during that time that
1:00:43
we wrote those two history pamphlets which I shared with you, the ones that
1:00:48
started this whole process [my papers to the OSU archives and the oral interviews]
1:00:50
: the ones called “Kids Open Up
1:00:54
Gates History” and one on Mill City history that had us getting
1:01:05
original research, both from people in those towns and going to Salem to
1:01:10
the state archives and the highway department to get information.
1:01:14
And eventually one of those books won an award from the Marion County
1:01:20
Historical Society for the research.
1:01:24
Lots of newspaper articles about both the history that we did and about the Odyssey
1:01:31
of the Mind winning teams that we had.
1:01:34
And during this time I had an experience with giving a memorial service for one
1:01:41
of my students who had been killed.
1:01:44
And that was a very emotional time and a challenge to both bring
1:01:51
his uniqueness and intelligence out, but not negate my own faith.
1:01:59
And
1:02:02
sometime during this time when I was in Mill City, I put on a winter program.
1:02:12
And in this program I had the history of Christmas carols and I asked the media
1:02:23
specialist to help me with the play.
1:02:25
And she looked at it and she looked at it and she said “Isn’t this
1:02:30
illegal?” ‘cause she was an atheist.
1:02:34
And I checked with the state department of education to make
1:02:40
sure I was on solid ground and had both religious and secular music.
1:02:45
But at the same time when there was a role that was like a role for the originator of
1:02:51
a carol at a church, the person playing that was comfortable with the role.
1:02:57
Or the person who played Saint Francis of Assisi was comfortable with that role.
1:03:06
It was one of the highlights of my teaching career to have this program
1:03:13
come together and have different classes singing and this play.
1:03:17
It was in the evening and the whole community came; it was truly wonderful.
1:03:22
But it was the son of the atheist media specialist who I
1:03:29
did the memorial service for.
1:03:31
So she’s in the audience and I have to come up with something that both honored
1:03:36
where she was and who she was and her son.
1:03:39
And in that case I had collected information from all my students
1:03:44
on things that they liked.
1:03:46
And one of the questions was “If you could invite anyone back in history
1:03:50
to be your teacher who would it be?” and this child who had died had put
1:03:57
down Adam and Eve, Noah, Jesus Christ.
1:04:04
He had had some Boy Scout friends that had shared some faith with him.
1:04:10
So I was able to use his words, not mine, to say to the whole
1:04:16
school-the whole school was out for the memorial service- that my wish
1:04:20
was that Eric was getting his wish.
1:04:23
So I didn’t put my faith out there, but was wholesomely neutral as I could be
1:04:31
to share some of his thoughts and ideas.
1:04:35
So that was one of the most difficult things that I did
1:04:41
in my teaching.
1:04:42
What was happening with my own children during this time?
1:04:46
As a family we stayed busy.
1:04:47
Some of our yearly reports are thousands of words long as our
1:04:51
children became teenagers.
1:04:53
Led by our son Michael, we all went from being cross country
1:04:57
skiers to downhill skiers.
1:04:59
There were sports, track and field for all of them, and other
1:05:02
talents: singing and writing.
1:05:04
My daughter, when asked just yesterday about these years, listed “going places,
1:05:09
playing games, cross country, downhill skiing, company, the church school
1:05:13
disaster which happened,” I talked a little bit about that, “new schools,
1:05:19
dad in PTA, minor injuries, various cars, life.” And “After we left home,”
1:05:24
she said, “you had new friends with connections that do not depend on the
1:05:28
age of your children,” because for awhile that’s who our friends were, the ones
1:05:32
that had the same ages as our children.
1:05:43
When we left [the property in] Lyons, which had a rental that paid for the
1:05:46
whole property, and a [cedar] roof that Robbie had made, we came here.
1:05:52
Financially it was a little more difficult and that’s maybe why I started
1:05:55
doing the substitute teaching, and during these years his parents passed away and
1:06:00
our nest slowly emptied with the kids applying to and getting into Ivy League
1:06:05
schools, and eventually they got careers in teaching, engineering, and law.
1:06:11
Beginning now in this Interview I’m going to quote some excerpts
1:06:14
from our yearly reports.
1:06:17
The first one is from
1:06:22
1984:
1:06:25
“Jean is excited about her half time teaching in the town of Mill
1:06:29
City, Robbie’s back is healing nicely after surgery, and he’s
1:06:36
back to work, skiing, wood cutting.
1:06:39
Miss Rob’s mother - died last Spring in a tragic fire in her home.”
1:06:46
And then I’m sending you this
1:06:50
letter with the picture of the whole family as the key to it so you can
1:06:55
have that to take back with you.
1:06:58
During these years our oldest child left for college and
1:07:02
I went to U of O in Eugene.
1:07:04
I took one or two evening classes a quarter.
1:07:09
It took me longer to get my masters degree than my doctorate because I was working
1:07:12
and our home was so full of people.
1:07:15
I did do my thesis at Gates Elementary School and my major at UO was
1:07:21
instruction with a specialization in Talented and Gifted Education.
1:07:28
Beginning when we moved out of Lyons I did become deeply involved
1:07:34
with One Way Fellowship in Stayton that after a while began having the
1:07:39
Sunday evening service in our home.
1:07:42
Then beginning in 1985 we had a stand-alone house church
1:07:48
called “Open Word Ministry” that met here for ten years.
1:07:54
Now, our fellowship often lasted 12 hours and included two meals, a potluck and
1:08:01
then whatever was left over for dinner.
1:08:03
And a couple of times I sat with my sons and counted how many different
1:08:09
individuals had come through that church, not the same person coming two times, but
1:08:16
different individuals; we had over 700
1:08:21
different people come through our house.
1:08:23
Now our living room was set up, it’s what?
1:08:28
13 by 33.
1:08:29
It was set up very differently: we had two sofas, we had a bench along the wall, we
1:08:34
had chairs we took out of the closet, we had big pillows on the floor for the kids.
1:08:40
So we were averaging 40 people per week.
1:08:49
During this time we shared our home with three families that had three to
1:08:52
five children for 6 months to two years.
1:08:58
The first family, the Chalupskys, are still our close neighbors and friends.
1:09:03
When they came at the end of 1985, our children were 11, 14, 16 and
1:09:08
their daughters were 2, 4, 6 and 8.
1:09:11
We made an extensive addition to our house to accommodate them and we had
1:09:15
a young man staying with us as well.
1:09:18
Every family in the church had extras and once in the same year, four families all
1:09:23
took in a Japanese student for the summer.
1:09:26
We also had Didier and Philippe from France for different summers.
1:09:34
As part of the group-people that came to our fellowship-we had
1:09:41
rotation of young people from a local Youth With A Mission
1:09:44
base located near Salem.
1:09:47
And because of that connection, in 1987 we planned a five week trip to
1:09:52
Europe where we camped and worked [on YWAM bases] . This was our second
1:09:57
trip to Europe; I think I talked a little bit about the first one.
1:10:01
In 1988, a couple of more excerpts from our Christmas letter:
1:10:10
that was when we decided for our two families to live separately so they moved
1:10:19
back up the road where they still live.
1:10:21
And
1:10:28
Mary was working at the [Detroit, Oregon] ranger station and she actually
1:10:33
worked in places in Yellowstone.
1:10:38
And we all climbed South Sister that year.
1:10:43
And then we wondered what use God would make of our 7-room house.
1:10:46
Well, another family in our church planned to build a house in Bend but
1:10:52
their house sold before it was built so they spent 6 months living with us.
1:10:58
So we had their three kids and our three kids for a while.
1:11:15
It was during this time that I set up what I would call my “Minority Business.”
1:11:20
I was a TAG consultant around the state.
1:11:26
I have a list of the many school districts that I went to in
1:11:31
1988-1997, just all over the state.
1:11:36
Both for teachers, like during in-service day I would lead
1:11:42
workshops, or for parents.
1:11:45
In the same amount of time I was doing work for the State Department.
1:11:51
During this time I collected data for the state, 1987-88 TAG directory of all
1:11:59
the programs and services and updated it the next year, was doing workshops
1:12:07
quite actively.
1:12:12
Also during this time starting in
1:12:18
1983-1989, I was involved with the Oregon Association for Talented
1:12:21
and Gifted also known as OATAG.
1:12:24
I directed a conference, was a lobbyist in the legislature, and
1:12:29
eventually the president who wrote for the Different Drummer which was a
1:12:39
newsletter for that organization.
1:12:42
And most of it was around Talented and Gifted, but as you may have
1:12:48
imagine every once and a while, I would put in a little of my beliefs
1:12:53
and have a real, in the crosshairs with people, who didn’t understand
1:13:02
having faith of some type is fine.
1:13:08
You can’t just take one faith and say “you can’t talk about that.” So I know
1:13:14
what I did was legal, but constantly in both OATAG and at OSU there was
1:13:23
this sense that you could be open about anything but not your Christian
1:13:29
faith and that happened then as well.
1:13:40
In 1989, actually starting in 1987, I took a year leave of absence from Mill City
1:13:47
School district to finish my degree and during that time the whole family was
1:13:58
coming back from...well my daughter was in college and my son was as well, she
1:14:07
was at Williams, my son was at Princeton.
1:14:10
They’d come back.
1:14:11
She was working on the forest fire crew and Michael was working on
1:14:16
the engineering crew and Matt was working with youth conservation core
1:14:21
although he was still in high school.
1:14:23
And feeling left out, I decided to do volunteer work part time with the
1:14:26
archeologist doing some field work and making drawing of artifacts.
1:14:32
Because of my children’s involvement, we often try to have people come
1:14:36
visit , both their friends and of course Didier and Philippe from France.
1:14:42
We also had Naoko who came from Japan and spent some time with us that year.
1:14:47
So
1:14:50
our house was full.
1:14:53
In 1989
1:14:58
we also welcomed into our family Elizabeth Issangya.
1:15:02
She is the daughter of a man who started a school of Evangelism in Tanzania that
1:15:13
we had been associated with since the late
1:15:18
‘80s.
1:15:18
He was a poor farmer with two acres.
1:15:20
He sold his farm to go to a Bible school in California, and then went back.
1:15:25
And over the last, what twenty some years now, he’s trained seven hundred
1:15:34
students who’ve started 1700 churches.
1:15:37
We had Elizabeth with us for three years.
1:15:40
She was the longest exchange student we’ve ever had.
1:15:44
She was here doing Matt’s last two years of High School and
1:15:50
then one year after he had gone.
1:16:04
In
1:16:08
1992 Matt graduated from high school; that’s when I was still working as a
1:16:14
correspondent and involved in OATAG.
1:16:18
Mary was in the Olympic trials doing a lot of cycling and my husband’s family
1:16:23
had a family reunion in California and our golden retriever joined our household.
1:16:30
At this point Robbie was serving on the Stayton High School Board; he was
1:16:38
elected in that position for three years.
1:16:40
And I began working at the Stayton [Middle] School and Sodaville
1:16:44
school district as a Consultant for Talented and Gifted Education.
1:16:52
Those were some of many schools I worked in between 1988-1998.
1:16:58
I had about forty school districts.
1:17:04
I also was an instructor for graduate courses and workshops for continuing
1:17:08
education summer sessions at Portland State University, University of
1:17:13
Oregon, Oregon State, Eastern Oregon State and Southern Oregon.
1:17:20
At Western University I consulted with and planned courses based on
1:17:27
a four-county needs assessment.
1:17:31
Taught many of them myself or helped them to choose other people to teach them.
1:17:42
Pause Please.
1:17:45
So in terms of your evolution as a teacher it seems that your work has
1:17:53
coincided with your children growing up.
1:17:55
You started as a preschool/kindergarten teacher when they were that age and
1:18:00
then you moved on to middle school and eventually you became a professor at
1:18:06
the undergraduate and graduate level.
1:18:08
Was - that something that came naturally or were you thinking about it consciously
1:18:13
as your children were growing up?
1:18:15
I think there was a time when I believed it was better for me to teach after I
1:18:21
worked with my own children that age.
1:18:24
That gave me insights I wouldn’t have if I didn’t do it that way and I certainly
1:18:29
know that my TAG work came because of...like my son Michael, I remember
1:18:35
he had a book out and it was “Hop on Pop” and he was turning the pages at 4.
1:18:42
And I thought he memorized but then I bought him another book and I figured out
1:18:46
at age 4 he just figured out how to read.
1:18:48
So I was very concerned that he and the other two children were not going
1:18:56
to-their education was going to-be missed like how I missed that one
1:19:00
child in my kindergarten class before.
1:19:04
So I think that is part of why I started Talented and Gifted
1:19:07
classes while I was at Mari-Linn.
1:19:10
My kids were in those TAG classes that I was teaching; I was working
1:19:13
with them and their teachers.
1:19:15
So that definitely drove my work there and I remember I took a class
1:19:20
at WOU on giving intelligence test and my kids were who I gave them too.
1:19:28
And that part of my career was definitely paralleled with the needs that I saw
1:19:37
in my own students [own children]
1:19:39
. Although I didn’t do very much active class teaching beyond the middle school
1:19:48
except that I did coach an Odyssey of the Mind team with my, two of my three,
1:19:57
kids when they were at high school with one of their teachers at the high
1:20:01
school so I did do some work over there.
1:20:04
And then when our kids learned track we were on the track
1:20:08
keeping track of the time.
1:20:10
I tried to stay involved with the kids and did do some work with their teachers as a
1:20:18
TAG person throughout as much as I could.
1:20:22
I tried to be there to help their teachers help them and stay
1:20:27
ahead of the programs myself.
1:20:29
So one of the interesting ways that my kids and I sort of taught and learned
1:20:37
from each other is that I was at Hoodoo with some friends of ours, the family who
1:20:46
had lived with us, the second family who had lived with us, were skiing up there.
1:20:51
And one kid had been trying to learn to snowboard and he was done and sore.
1:20:56
The ticket on his jacket was good.
1:21:00
I was talking to my son Michael and Michael said, “Hey Mom, why don’t you
1:21:03
get out here and ski?” Well this is 1988
1:21:09
and I had a student of mine from Mill City school district was on the slopes.
1:21:16
And I was like “You come down that run?” It was just an
1:21:19
easy run and I didn’t know it.
1:21:21
So I let my son push me into the line at Hoodoo with his two long skis and
1:21:30
two long boots: I can’t stop, I can’t turn, I’m scared stiff hanging on on
1:21:38
the ski lift, get off, falling down.
1:21:44
But I notice there are all sorts of people young and old big and fat, all
1:21:50
sorts of people able to ski.
1:21:53
So I figured, “You can do this!” So I came back and took a lesson and
1:21:58
after...so we started skiing as a family it was just wonderful. And after a
1:22:03
couple years I decided I would try to
1:22:10
become a ski teacher. Now remember I had had some experience
1:22:14
teaching but I wasn’t a skier.
1:22:18
I did this interview over in Bend with the director and he could tell I could
1:22:24
teach and when we had our on the snow exam there was hardly any snow so he
1:22:34
didn’t know until after he had hired me that I really couldn’t ski yet.
1:22:39
But ski instructors have a lot of training so at the end of the quarter I was skiing.
1:22:46
But my family, my three teenagers, thought I was gold when I came home
1:22:53
and I said, “I am now a ski teacher and you get cheap ski passes, family ski
1:23:01
passes.” So for many years there skiing became our strong family bond because no
1:23:08
matter how fast the kids go, if I want to follow them I can keep up with them.
1:23:13
And so I was an instructor at Hoodoo Ski area from 1989 to 1990
1:23:19
about to 1995 and then beyond in minor ways, and then starting
1:23:31
in 1994 I became a ski patroller as well.
1:23:34
Now the reason this skiing fits in with this next part which is what
1:23:44
happened with our house church is that the ski thing took place during
1:23:53
the same time as the Sunday mornings that we had multiple people here.
1:24:00
And so we let go of the house church to start hanging out up there and
1:24:07
for awhile, for two years we had this early morning before-the-mountain got
1:24:11
started sort of small service at the ski area; we got permission to do that.
1:24:19
And during this same time in the early 1990s my Christian ministry
1:24:26
sort of branched out from the house church when I decided to begin
1:24:32
work with incarcerated individuals.
1:24:34
Now I know this is a weird thing to say but it’s true that there aresuch
1:24:39
a large percentage of the African American population, a larger percentage
1:24:44
of African American population in Oregon is in the prison, than appears
1:24:48
in the population of Oregon, which is true across the United States.
1:24:52
So by going into the prison I also was in some ways increasing the number
1:24:58
of black people I interacted with.
1:25:00
Now we also within our church, we had the families from Issangya’s [family]
1:25:08
- Elizabeth Issangya from Tanzania.
1:25:10
And we had a couple of families that were biracial or had adopted black children so
1:25:16
we did have that variety in our church.
1:25:18
And I think that is part of why we came together as family because we
1:25:22
did have diversity here that you didn’t have at most of the churches.
1:25:25
But I started working with prison fellowship.
1:25:30
I was going into the Oregon Women’s Correction Facility, the
1:25:36
women’s penitentiary more or less.
1:25:38
I was going into Marion County jails and doing Bible studies
1:25:43
and also counseling individuals.
1:25:49
And of course,
1:25:54
I found that so often people see you in a role and they speak to
1:26:01
you in that role regardless of whether you have the keys to it.
1:26:06
I remember sitting around the table in Marion County jail and having a
1:26:10
guard start sharing his life with me because he knew I was this counselor
1:26:18
and I think I began to get some key listening skills, because of this
1:26:27
working in the prisons, which served me very well later as a teacher.
1:26:32
That sort of allowing, where someone was to come out and seeing if I could begin
1:26:39
to help them and move them along in a direction they already wanted to go.
1:26:45
My philosophy has been, I believe from both the house church and the
1:26:52
prison work and certainly as I moved into OSU, to help people become
1:26:57
self-directed life-long learners.
1:27:00
Our church functioned in a circle.
1:27:02
There was no one leader.
1:27:04
Everyone was responsible for sharing whatever they had, for starting a song,
1:27:09
for sharing a verse, for bringing their needs, bringing their prayer request.
1:27:14
And so not only did I have that here but at this point I was also
1:27:20
trying to help the people other house churches started both here and in
1:27:25
other places and actually did some traveling specifically to help house
1:27:30
churches in other states a little bit.
1:27:33
I was seen as a strong leader in that movement and I was working with people
1:27:42
who were writing books in that area.
1:27:45
I had a website where I was putting my writings on house church,
1:27:51
it’s still out there actually.
1:27:53
If you Google it you can see my Christian writings are still out there,
1:27:58
and that happened during this time.
1:28:01
I consider myself a pro-life feminist.
1:28:05
And when Salem was considering a Planned Parenthood facility and I did a regular,
1:28:12
usually solo picket of the site.
1:28:16
because it is in my belief in the value of human life.
1:28:19
I am anti-war, anti-death penalty, anti-abortion.
1:28:24
One of my signs says “Equal Rights for Unborn Women”- I
1:28:30
had others. I don’t want to get on the soap box and be preaching at this
1:28:36
point so I won’t go through all of them. Whenever I feel strongly about
1:28:40
something I am usually willing to take a stand even when it’s against the grain.
1:28:47
I was doing solo pickets when there were organized pickets.
1:28:51
I wanted to go and do it myself.
1:28:53
Sometimes I would do it on roller blades carrying my little picket
1:28:56
signs and I think I was on the front page of the Statesman
1:28:59
Journal once with one of my signs.
1:29:05
So, yet how did this heavy involvement in these different faith-based work of mine
1:29:17
and my continuing work in Talented and Gifted, which was going on, my instruction
1:29:25
teaching in skiing, how did those become
1:29:34
changed when I undertook a doctoral program at OSU?
1:29:39
And we’re going to pick up that story in the final interview beginning
1:29:43
on how I made that decision.
1:29:47
One of my favorite metaphors
1:29:52
is a river that’ll come through next time.
1:29:56
But my other one is a tree so I’d like to end with what I consider my life
1:30:02
verse from Psalms: “She shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.
1:30:12
And whatsoever
1:30:15
she does shall prosper.
1:30:17
She’ll bring forth her fruit in her season and her leaf shall not wither.”
1:30:24
There’s lots of ways to view that.
1:30:26
I did make it more feminine than it is in the original.
1:30:30
So...there we go!
