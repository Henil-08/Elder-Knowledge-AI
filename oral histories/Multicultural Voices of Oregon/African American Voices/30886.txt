00:02
Today is Monday October 17th, 2011.
00:09
My name is Jean Golson Moule.
00:12
I am going to begin by talking about my childhood background
00:19
which begins with my grandparents.
00:23
I never knew any of my grandparents as three of them had died by the
00:27
time I was born, and I never met the one who lived into the 1960's.
00:33
My father tells a story of when he was a small child and
00:37
lived with his grandmother.
00:39
His grandfather, as far as I can discern from hushed stories, was lynched: he
00:47
managed to own rich bottom land and some wanted to rid the area of this
00:52
person of the “wrong color” to own land.
00:57
Yet, my father remembers traveling over this property [with his
01:00
grandmother] gathering rents from those who lived there.
01:03
And, in his understanding of the world of his childhood, he
01:07
thought all of the people in power and those with money were Black!
01:17
His parents were Thomas Golson, born 1880 in Orangeburg, SC and lived in North, SC.
01:25
Isn’t that a name for a town?
01:27
And Bessy McCrary, born in 1890 in Springfield, SC; she
01:33
died in 1921, he died in 1969.
01:38
I do not know how his parents died; I do know that he lived first
01:42
with a family member he did not like, then a few peaceful years
01:45
with his grandmother and cousin.
01:48
When his grandmother died he ended up with Uncle Loman and Aunt Martha, his father's
01:52
sister, who had no children of her own.
01:55
He began plowing with a mule by age 8 or 9 with a smaller plow made just
02:02
for him by his blacksmith uncle.
02:07
An activity he would continue in some manner including using that skill to
02:13
support his few years in a private boarding high school/college: Voorhees.
02:26
My father, Matthew Arnold Golson, born in 1919 or 1920 in
02:31
Great Branch, South Carolina.
02:33
He was an exceptional individual in his youth, going to and
02:37
winning at the national level in the judging of livestock.
02:41
He was well-known and appreciated in his home in Great Branch making
02:46
his way through World War II as a staff sergeant, fathering 5 children
02:52
in three households by age 29, yet providing for all of us, by 1953, $5000
03:02
in the bank for each of their educations.
03:06
On May 8th, 2010 at Voorhees College my daughter [Mary Ellen Moule] introduced
03:14
or spoke to the graduates at Voorhees College on the behalf of my father.
03:20
She says, “Like many of you he was the first person in his family to
03:26
attend college. When he arrived at Voorhees Normal and Industrial school
03:31
in 1936 it offered both the high school diploma because many of the
03:36
segregated rural schools ended in the 9th grade. Dr. Golson earned his
03:42
tuition by working on the school farm,” as I said, plowing behind a mule.
03:48
In fact, his uncle Loman watched him trying to work with a plow, a large one,
03:57
at about age 8 and made him a small sized plow, so that he could work with it.
04:05
The work study program at Voorhees
04:09
focused on getting a degree, also developing character and skills for life.
04:17
The college is still like that.
04:20
“Dr. Golson” [because he does have an honorary degree], graduated 1940,
04:26
served in the army during World War II, and migrated to New York City.
04:31
He worked hard and established a successful career in real state
04:35
in New York and South Carolina.
04:37
But if you asked him about his greatest accomplishment he will tell you that he
04:41
sent all five of his children and all six of his grandchildren to college.
04:46
“We have used our educations,” this is what my daughter says, “to become
04:50
teachers, college professors, lawyers, engineers, and community organizers.
04:56
I would venture to say that he’s very proud of us and we are proud of him too.”
05:07
If you think about it, $5000
05:11
in the year 1953 was an extraordinary amount of money and he had that
05:17
in the bank for each of us five children; who were in three homes
05:23
before he had his second suit.
05:26
And I think that that tells you how much he valued education and how through
05:34
my whole life and my siblings’ lives, getting an education going on as far
05:42
as possible was just something...you were going to go to college.
05:47
You were going to take advantage of all the education that you could.
05:53
And I mean, this tells you a little about why there was that
05:57
push from the very beginning.
06:00
My mother, Mary Ann Moseley, was born in Charleston on January 29, 1925,
06:08
she was also an orphan and, like my father raised by “the village.” You
06:14
know you have heard that it takes a whole village to raise a child.
06:18
Well I think that part of the history in the African American communities,
06:22
especially in places like Fort Motte where I was born was that people
06:29
were communally held and communally responsible to a very large extent.
06:38
There’s Swahili, I believe I’ve got this right, that in Swahili the word “Aunt”
06:45
and “Mother” are exactly the same word.
06:47
And if you understand that, then you understand why, in a village, children
06:52
are jointly held; and for all the years of slavery and all the things that went
06:59
on in this small Southern community, not that long out of slavery, that
07:04
was still what was going on strongly.
07:07
And of course I think that’s true in many rural communities,
07:11
including white communities, historically in the United States.
07:14
So it’s not just a racial thing but I think there is some
07:17
definite connections there.
07:23
Her birth mother was Clara Gilliard, who was born in 1892 in Charleston,
07:31
South Carolina; she died in 1926.
07:37
The father she remembers was Jerry Moseley, born in Fort Motte in 1890,
07:43
who died in 1934, yet, I doubt that this dark-skinned man could have been
07:51
my very fair mother's biological father.
07:54
There is a good chance that he was not her actual father.
08:01
I was born on October 27, 1945 to this 20 year old woman in
08:08
Fort Motte, South Carolina.
08:10
Today Fort Motte has about the same number of residents as at the time of my birth.
08:17
A drowsy quiet town was warm in people and air.
08:22
My grandmother's house sat across the road from the railroad line and
08:26
unlimited fields and streams beyond.
08:29
Visiting from the flat, dull, smoggy L.A.
08:34
valley was a delight.
08:35
We’ll talk about that migration later.
08:38
I remember though, in Fort Motte, walking down the dusty dirt road to the
08:42
old store that smelled of years and had little more than penny candy and orange
08:48
soda pop in a case on the front porch.
08:51
I remember the bench near the front door that held some of
08:54
the town's older gentlemen.
08:57
They sat to talk and scared me silly with their very presence.
09:02
I realized at some point that I had to be 3rd cousins with everyone in
09:08
town...and one of those, Aunt Fannie, the town's midwife helped bring me into
09:14
this world weighing me in at 10 lbs.
09:17
I often thought that this was a guess and that my slight slim mother could
09:21
not have produced this huge first baby.
09:23
Yet the picture of me at one year, at 30 pounds testifies
09:28
to this probable birth weight.
09:31
In my mind I sense the slow gait of those who walked the roads, the quiet
09:36
of the dense southern vegetation and the heaviness of the humid air.
09:41
I remember chasing the hen and chicks, finally exhausting to death the last
09:46
chick that I was usually able to catch.
09:49
I remember catching catfish with my Aunt Corrine, my mother's adoptee
09:54
mother, chosen by her, my mother was chosen by Aunt Corrine when her
10:01
own mother died in childbirth with twins, an event my mother remembers;
10:08
she was 18 months old at the time.
10:12
At my Aunt Corrine’s place, after we caught catfish, I'd check in the
10:19
bucket after we carried them home.
10:23
And then one time they were missing.
10:26
I discovered that Aunt Corrine had fed them to the cats.
10:33
As I said before, so in Swahili the same word is “mother” and “aunt” and
10:39
I understand now that my birth town echoed that "it takes a whole village
10:44
to raise a child" -an African proverb.
10:47
When my grandmother died in childbirth, it was simply a matter of who would
10:52
take in which of the children.
10:55
And Aunt Corrine chose my mother.
10:57
I won’t go into great detail but I know from my mother’s story
11:01
that Aunt Corrine raised her to basically help around the house and
11:06
she had a very unhappy childhood.
11:10
I visited this town beginning at age 3 and every few years until I was 13.
11:17
At age 50 I took two of my own grown children back.
11:20
We drove slowly down the dusty roads, me trying to see and guess if one of
11:25
the dilapidated houses was the one I remembered fondly...the smell of
11:30
the water when it came through the pump, the search for chicken eggs,
11:33
the chamber pot until I was old enough to make my own trek to the outhouse.
11:39
Fortunately I had yet to have the glasses of socio-economic status and
11:45
my father's distain for that which was not top notch and assimilated
11:52
to the mainstream white culture.
11:55
The country smells that surrounded me for my first 6 months lived in
11:58
me, and from those first early months and my visits as a small child,
12:05
spoke of a time and place that eventually I returned to, in my mid
12:09
twenties, when I headed to Oregon.
12:12
Before that I took a quite standard African American migration route: the
12:17
south, a northern city: New York City in my case, and then West to Los Angeles.
12:31
I was brought to New York when I was six months old, specifically the Bronx,
12:37
that was my home for my first 6 years.
12:41
According to my parents, their first items in their New York City apartment
12:44
was me and a radio so my father could listen to the baseball games.
12:49
To this day, at age 92, he knows the batting averages of some top players.
12:55
I have [no] memories of these years, yet enjoy the ones my mother tells me.
13:07
We moved into an apartment and in this case it was a two story townhouse.
13:15
We were in the upstairs and another family was in the downstairs and
13:21
this must have been our second place.
13:23
I was about five years old and my sister was three.
13:28
There as a stoop out front which both families could sit on and the
13:34
first time that we went to sit on the stoop the children in the downstairs
13:39
apartment told us that we didn’t belong there, that we couldn’t sit there.
13:44
So, my mother tells a story that I went upstairs and I found the hoses
13:51
from the vacuum cleaner, gave one to my sister, and I took one and we went
13:57
down and hit the little boy on his shoulders so that we could sit were
14:03
we were supposed to be able to sit.
14:07
When we first moved Bronx it was 98 percent Jewish.
14:11
The same areas are now 98 percent black.
14:15
My father was a part of this process.
14:17
He would buy a house through his Jewish friends.
14:20
Then he would move my mother, my sister and me into the house.
14:24
The neighbors, not liking the color of the new neighbors, would
14:27
sell their homes at lower prices.
14:30
My father and his Jewish buddies would then buy the house and sell
14:34
it at a profit to a black family.
14:38
I
14:45
wrote this for part of a chapter of my book Cultural Competence:
14:49
A Primer for Educators Chapter
14:54
7: Jean was six years old.
14:56
Her family had quietly moved into an all-White, mostly Jewish neighborhood.
15:01
Despite an act of overt racism—one morning her father had seen ‘N——— go
15:08
back where you came from’ scrawled on the outside of the house and, without
15:14
telling anyone, washed it off—my parents had hoped that the school personnel
15:20
would treat me like any other child.
15:23
Perhaps pretending there was no difference would help me to ‘fit in.’
15:31
I experienced being different even as my parents worked to help me assimilate.
15:39
During a Jewish holiday, for example there were only two children
15:44
in the entire school, and I was the only student in my class.
15:49
And I wondered, ‘Why isn’t the teacher teaching me today?
15:52
I am here!’ So both in school and often socially, I was alone
15:59
and something was not okay.
16:02
My mother tells a story, I actually don’t have a good memory and never did, it’s not
16:06
just because I am 65 [laughs] . My mother came to pick me up from the second grade
16:14
because the teacher had said that I would wait outside the door of the classroom
16:21
and as the students came out, one by one, I’d stomp on their toes as they
16:33
left the school.
16:33
I have one other story from my very young childhood that I think says a lot
16:42
about my own journey ever since then.
16:47
We had a..., I think I was about three years old at the time, and we had a
16:53
latch on the door of the apartment.
16:57
And I pushed a chair up and opened the latch and I got out.
17:04
My mother hadn’t noticed that I was gone; she was standing by the front
17:09
door [window] and as she was looking through the front door [window] , she
17:12
looks across the street and she sees this little girl just spinning around
17:17
and just having a great time and she’s thinking “Oh what a cute little girl.
17:22
Ah!
17:23
that’s Jeanie.” So she just yells “Don’t move, don’t move!”
17:28
and runs out and gets me.
17:29
But I have often thought that as far as I can tell I really do have all my life
17:35
pushed the envelope from a very young age.
17:39
And that’s the first story that I know of, well I guess the vacuum cleaner says
17:44
something too, where I just went beyond the bounds of the walls that were put in
17:49
front of me to find out something else.
17:53
Did you, can I ask though.
17:54
Sure.
17:56
Did you ever, when you were little, do you remember, it sounds like
17:58
you had feelings of frustration.
18:01
Did you ever associate that with it being your family and knowing
18:08
and you were so young, did you make that connection or do you think you
18:12
were making it when you were little?
18:14
Well, I think that obviously there was a certain frustration
18:18
if I’m stomping on the toes of the kids outside my classroom door.
18:22
That’s a pretty aggressive thing to do.
18:25
I have a picture of myself at Halloween and you can just see that
18:27
I am the only brown face there.
18:29
I know I had a couple of close Jewish friends but I don’t ever
18:32
remember being in their houses.
18:34
I remember walking down the street with them; I had a godmother Aunt
18:40
Lila that would come and visit.
18:42
She was a live-in maid and she, I remember her in and out of
18:49
my life, she never married.
18:52
We visited her once in Greens...Greensville?
18:55
Greensborough?
18:55
and
19:01
this was when we had children.
19:03
And here I am visiting my godmother; she made dinner for us and she wouldn’t sit
19:09
at the table, at her own apartment because she was so used to the servant role.
19:17
She could make dinner for us but she couldn’t sit at the table with us.
19:21
Isn’t that amazing?
19:22
So I had little pieces of seeing the remnants of the very, very
19:33
low expectations for African Americans in our society.
19:41
My father wanted so much to give us a different viewpoint and a different
19:47
life style that he literally cut off all connections to our extended family, and
19:53
so I lived a very isolated childhood.
19:58
It was just my mother and my sister and I and as I’ve said
20:03
before I have in one calendar year my father had three children.
20:10
And so at the same time I was born he was also trying to do some financial support
20:18
for my half-brother and half-sister.
20:22
And so, you know, looking back on it I see that he did as best he could at
20:28
the age he was; to have done what he did starting at age 39 is, I think,
20:33
really amazing, but we isolated.
20:37
Now I think my parents really hid from me as best as possible the acts of
20:47
discrimination that happened at that time.
20:51
I have talked a little bit about my childhood in New York City and
20:57
I left New York City, I believe I was six I left, so I was very young.
21:05
I don’t think I had conversations about race then because even up
21:10
until the time I was a teenager there wasn’t, even among the black community,
21:15
there was little open talk about race, particularly not in my family.
21:23
You see that picture right there?
21:25
There is a picture of my mother.
21:26
She’s very fair in the top shelf there and this is the next
21:31
little story from my childhood.
21:34
In 1953 we drove across the country to Los Angeles.
21:39
I have been in all 50 states and this was the first of 13 trips I have taken,
21:45
by car from one coast to the other.
21:49
I remember my mother would go into the lobby of the motel to get us a
21:53
room: she could pass for white and she would be able to get a room while
21:59
my brown-skinned father could not.
22:01
And then after she got the room she’d come back in and we’d all drive around and then
22:05
go into the room after she got the key.
22:08
And, but often, he would simply drive for 18 hours straight and pull
22:12
over to the side of the road and we would sleep in the car before
22:14
continuing the journey the next day.
22:18
So those are some of the memories that I had.
22:21
And my father, because of his wanting to have his children make a strong a
22:28
break as possible from what he saw as a
22:35
black oppressive positioning, tried to give us experiences that in some way
22:46
while very wonderful were also very “white.” I went to a ballet school in New
22:53
York City around those ages and I have seen the picture of those 40 children.
22:57
Now this is not in the Jewish school but it is still in the
23:00
community and there were only two brown faces and I was one of them.
23:04
I remember
23:08
we went to a resort for a summer vacation, supposedly.
23:14
But it’s in the Catskills, it’s expensive, everybody there was white.
23:18
The only thing I remember from this place that should have been a summer
23:21
camp and fun thing was you know, in the room getting dressed up as
23:27
prettily as possible so that we would put on a good front for, supposedly,
23:32
breaking the barrier and being there.
23:34
It wasn’t fun, it was like putting on a front.
23:38
My father always was and still is very much about appearances.
23:43
My father is 92 years old - I have never seen him in a tee-shirt.
23:51
I have only seen him in a button down shirt, with or
23:54
without a tie, or his pajamas.
23:56
He would eat breakfast in his pajamas.
23:58
But, I have never even seen him in that kind of informal dress
24:02
because he just didn’t do that.
24:04
He is very well-dressed very well manicured, quite a bit, always has been.
24:11
So that’s that background and that side of the family.
24:17
So my parents about this age, age six, my parents separated.
24:24
And at this point we left and I have a couple of little
24:30
stories about the time in L.A.
24:36
The year after I was stomping the... I don’t know I keep coming back to that.
24:41
It’s just I can’t imagine doing it because I am a very, at this point in time,
24:48
I don’t...I stay away from conflict.
24:52
I will stand firmly on the truth and we’ll talk about the times that I have
24:56
done that and it’s caused me trouble.
24:58
But, it’s really hard for me to imagine physically doing that.
25:02
‘Course I was six, so, okay seven.
25:05
Alright, the next year I move with my family from their East Coast urban
25:12
area, as part of this migration, to a West Coast suburb, from a
25:16
two-parent to a one-parent family.
25:19
My new school, Virginia Road Elementary School, was as culturally diverse
25:24
as any that Los Angeles could offer.
25:28
Miss Thomas’s room was a secure and healthy place for both my own
25:33
emotions and my classmates’ toes.
25:36
I was learning about my own culture and in ways, becoming immersed in that culture.
25:44
I just want to say a little bit about the teacher, Miss Thomas.
25:47
I remember her so strongly because she was one of those teachers where you
25:52
could hear a pin drop in her room, for 3rd grade that was pretty extraordinary.
26:00
And, she was the first person that validated or let me see how bright I was.
26:10
She used to put a ten by ten addition problem on
26:17
the board.
26:18
Ten figures by ten figures.
26:20
And she would put two of them up and call people up to do them
26:23
and I was always the last one.
26:25
I could always do it well.
26:28
For some reason that really stands out to me because I think that’s the first
26:32
time that I had been in a situation where before other people, and see I don’t
26:38
think teachers should do things like that right now, I don’t think that’s a
26:41
good philosophy [laughs] . But at the time I remember needing the validation
26:45
that I did, partly because of the isolation I felt in New York City; that
26:49
was probably a very good balance for me.
26:51
And I remember that I met her years later on a train going from
26:56
the West coast to the East coast.
26:58
She just happened to be there, this was after she had retired and I
27:02
remember talking to her briefly.
27:03
But one other thing about her class and this I think is extraordinary because
27:10
we are talking about 1954 by now maybe.
27:13
Each day she wrote a Spanish phrase in the corner of the blackboard.
27:17
She read it to the class then had the children repeat it.
27:21
In less than a minute of classroom time she acknowledged her Mexican
27:24
American students and opened the door to another language for all of us.
27:30
Her classroom was safe from disrespect towards her and among her students.
27:37
And I strongly think of her influence.
27:40
She is one of the very few teachers that I remember by name.
27:45
There is hardly any others I remember.
27:47
There was Mr. Merrill and Mr. Sparrow.
27:49
In that same school... oh and Mr. Uyeno here [laughs]
27:56
. There’s this particular elementary school in the 5th grade this is 1956.
28:04
I think there are 30 some students, 33 students in the class.
28:10
Less than half are African American there’s no one majority in the class.
28:16
You see Asian students, you see Latino/a students.
28:24
My best friend was Anne who was a Jewish individual, which makes sense because I
28:28
had just come from a Jewish community.
28:32
And my other best friend was Penny, African American, “Skinny Penny”
28:37
[laughs] . So those were the two I hung around most with. But at some point
28:42
they, I forget exactly what grade it was, I think they didn’t skip me but
28:49
had me take the higher level twice.
28:51
It was really weird, there was something that was happening, of course
28:54
I was testing pretty high by then.
28:56
So let me ask you: was this school, based on the school district, the people living
29:03
in the area were ethnically diverse or you mentioned the suburbs, so were these the
29:08
children that you would play with not just in school but outside of the classroom?
29:14
So now you had a more diverse playgroup?
29:16
That’s right.
29:17
And now I was going to read this one other part.
29:22
When we arrived in L.A. we quickly found a room in the home of Aunt Vel.
29:28
Now her family continues to be friends with my mother and to some
29:32
extent myself nearly 60 years later.
29:37
Aunt Vel passed away at about age 50, her sister Aunt Lottie is a healthy
29:43
like 103, 104, and I knew her back then.
29:47
And this extended family became our family during our first years in Los Angeles.
29:53
But the interesting thing about that is that we weren’t related.
29:57
It was just that it was a room in a home that she had.
30:01
My mother rented it from her when we first went to L.A. before we
30:05
established ourselves in a home.
30:08
But it became our family because that is what you did, so that the Auntie
30:13
thing was still continuing there.
30:16
You know I have pictures of me setting up a lemonade stand in
30:20
front of her house and her daughter
30:26
Urra is still friends with my mother.
30:28
And
30:31
Aunt Vel’s granddaughter, Adrienne, is someone I have been skiing with.
30:35
So the family has continued those connections.
30:40
When I was at Virginia Road, I was in a Girl Scout troop; I went to summer camps;
30:53
I would go on trips travelling back cross county, some of those
30:57
trips to South Carolina, Fort Motte, happened at this time.
31:02
So we did a lot of traveling.
31:04
At that time my father took us on a car trip North, first time I
31:11
went through Oregon and Washington.
31:13
Went to Glacier National Park and it was those times that we’d
31:18
be out on a trail and I just so loved it, I loved the country.
31:22
I would just take off and almost get lost because I wanted to see more of that.
31:29
Los Angeles area we did, Griffith Park was a large park that my
31:33
mother would take us to sometime.
31:35
And it wasn’t just a neighborhood park it was mountains and I would
31:39
get out in them if I possibly could.
31:42
But yeah, the
31:45
elementary school was quite diverse and all the schools I went to in L.A. were.
31:53
We had in just a few years ago a 40th high school reunion and at that 40th
32:02
high school reunion were a couple of people who were in this picture,
32:05
who I had been to elementary school with even though we ended up in
32:14
junior highs and high schools that were not in exactly the same district somehow
32:18
we had managed to be in the same ones.
32:23
At our high school we had a cheer it was “Gray boys, Spooks, Buddha heads, Jews,
32:33
with this combination how can L.A. lose?” [laughs] “Two, four, six, eight, we don’t
32:39
want to segregate” [laughs] . And I think that that’s extraordinary that in the
32:47
late 50’s and early 60’s, to have been part of such a well integrated community.
32:54
‘Cause that is very, it’s unusual now even, it was extremely unusual then.
32:59
That these communities were, the neighborhoods were interracial,
33:03
the schools were interracial.
33:05
There was not strong barriers and the neighborhood that the school was in, I
33:10
have been back, it looks almost exactly the same as it did when I lived there
33:13
which is something else extraordinary.
33:15
The houses are just the same, little stucco houses and the
33:19
lawns and the little playgrounds they haven’t changed very much.
33:23
Which is amazing.
33:24
Can I ask you so it sounds like the students were very diverse, so two
33:29
questions, what about the teachers themselves and also the curriculum?
33:34
I am really interested to know if the curriculum was very white history based
33:40
or if you remember it being more diverse.
33:42
Your teacher encouraged Spanish language and she acknowledged
33:47
students’ racial identities.
33:48
Was that also in the curriculum, do you remember that?
33:51
Okay, I don’t think she acknowledged racial differences
33:55
at all, the teacher didn’t.
33:58
I think that there was in this school a variety of teachers.
34:05
I remember having, while I was at Virginia Road Elementary School, I
34:09
had two white teachers, female; two black teachers, male; and Mr. Uyeno,
34:20
Asian.
34:21
So the teachers here were diverse but I’m sure that the curriculum was mainstream
34:27
centered with no racial diversity at all, I’m almost positive of that.
34:35
One of the stories from my high school years again when we talk about
34:40
things that impacted me greatly - I
34:44
think I actually wrote about this in my chapter on biases.
34:48
But no, it was a profound thing for me and it took me a long, long time
34:56
to really understand the context.
35:00
But, I
35:03
did not do well in history and I recognize now that I did not
35:08
do well in history because of the way the curriculum was based.
35:13
That is was just white history, mentions of slavery was hidden and
35:22
certainly nothing you talked about.
35:24
No understanding of
35:29
the beginning racial civil rights.
35:33
Nothing like that was taught it was just pretty much put under the rug you just did
35:38
what you did and taught what you taught.
35:41
Because of that and also because I have a poor memory for dates right, but you have
35:45
to remember that in high school in math and science I was in all the AP classes.
35:53
I was often the only African American, even though it was a very well integrated
35:58
school, I would be the only African American, maybe one other, in the room.
36:03
And very often one of three girls.
36:05
In the high level classes?
36:09
In the high level classes.
36:10
In Calculus and Physics... [laughs] and all those
36:17
other things and I was good at it, I loved it.
36:20
I didn’t do as well in English classes.
36:22
I was in mid-level English classes.
36:26
I am surprised sometimes when I see that I am a writer now, but
36:28
that is a whole another story.
36:31
But, history, oh my gosh, did not do well in history at all.
36:36
Just the memory and I realize now it’s just this dead white
36:41
guys; [laughs] this is what we were studying for the most part.
36:45
It didn’t go back; when you went back in the ancient history you certainly
36:49
had nothing about Africa - it’s just this whole continent and little
36:54
mention of the Chinese, it was all about European American history.
36:58
The Cro-Magnon men in European continent which is funny, I had something I was
37:03
just reading something, this book.
37:05
You know Europe is not really a continent, [laughs] if you think about
37:08
it’s a peninsula as huge as a continent.
37:11
But, we see it as, even seeing that as a continent is just a biased perspective.
37:18
But, of course I was raised to...I am not sure if you get over it completely.
37:24
When you’ve heard it once in elementary, once through junior high, and once
37:29
through high school so I still have to battle those things in my mind myself.
37:33
But, so I didn’t like history, ended up having to retake the
37:38
history class in the summer and this time I sort of went for it.
37:45
And started to research, I loved the Western movement.
37:48
Remember I like to journey I like to travel; so you can imagine the whole idea
37:52
of getting on a wagon train and going into the unknown and being part of that
37:57
pioneer spirit and climbing mountains.
37:59
I mean that so appealed to me.
38:02
Oh, by the way, I also wanted to be the first woman in space.
38:06
No one else has done that yet but, when I was 11/12 I was reading
38:12
space books, science fiction books, had pictures of jet planes new
38:17
jet planes [laughs] on the wall.
38:21
I was so focused on that and I say now that being both black and female
38:29
probably did more to curtail that than my own inward desire to do it.
38:34
But I didn’t get that at the time so I think part of it is a feeling of
38:38
failure on my own part, when let’s face it, the one time that they
38:43
were going to take some of us in one the advanced placement classes to
38:50
something...I can’t remember the name of it but it was some big fieldtrip.
38:55
They were going to just take a few people and you wrote an essay and when we came
38:59
up to do the interview for who exactly was going to get to go they started the
39:06
interview by saying “we’re not going to take any women because we don’t want
39:11
to have to take a female chaperone.” So that was it and yet no one questioned
39:17
it, I didn’t know to question it.
39:19
And so, I had those kinds of barriers in front of me.
39:23
I remember I wanted to take a drafting class because I
39:25
like that precision and stuff.
39:27
I walked into the drafting class and the teacher looks at me, like, it’s
39:31
clear he doesn’t want a girl in there; he doesn’t want a woman in that class.
39:35
He wants nothing but guys.
39:36
I would have taken auto mechanics if it had been open to women.
39:39
Because I liked that kind of stuff.
39:41
To this day I wish I had taken an auto mechanics class.
39:44
So back to the history, I sort of went on a... [laughs] So, I had done
39:50
the research; you know you go through and make the little index cards and
39:54
I done a good job on the research.
39:56
And I started writing the draft of the introduction to my paper.
40:05
And I started it by pretending that I was a wagon master.
40:10
And I’m saying “Wagons Ho!” It just started with a few quotes like that just
40:17
to get things going. My teacher sent me back the paper and said...she gave me an
40:25
“F” on it and said “You’ve plagiarized this.” She wouldn’t accept it as mine
40:33
because from her perspective it was too good to come from an African American,
40:37
I guess. I don’t know but what can I do?
40:42
I didn’t finish the paper [laughs] , got another low grade and she just
40:46
didn’t believe I did it myself.
40:50
That’s sort of a key part to me because I think that’s part of what drives
40:56
me to help teachers understand the impact they can have on students,
41:06
with something that simple.
41:08
So you know what that did to me?
41:10
It turned me off to...history for sure, writing to a certain extent,
41:19
creative writing to a certain extent.
41:22
In
41:25
retrospect I met and married my husband who was a history major with a little
41:31
bit of “Am I really going do this, marry someone who is a historian, excuse me?”
41:36
Because of the way I felt about history.
41:39
When that happened to you did you talk to other professors?
41:43
Where there other professors you could talk to?
41:44
Well this was highschool.
41:45
Right in highschool, were there teachers that you talked to or your parents?
41:48
There is no one to talk to.
41:50
What about your classmates, did you vent to your classmates?
41:53
There was no one that you felt that you could turn to?
41:56
No.
41:57
I think that because of my earlier upbringing in New York City with my
42:07
mother, who did not go past high school, and my father graduated with basically a
42:15
high school diploma from Voorhees which was a combination high school and college.
42:20
So, they were really interested in us getting an education, but they
42:25
probably weren’t all that comfortable themselves confronting the teachers.
42:36
Let’s just put it...my friends were “thin” [laughs] I didn’t have very
42:42
many - I was very much isolated because of my parents and then also because of
42:51
their...I think my mother, as a single mother, was probably very protective
42:55
of where I would go, when I would go: things probably as simple as overnights
43:02
and going off with people and having fun.
43:08
I think she felt she had to be, which I understand, keeping us
43:12
really close; as I would if I was a single mother with two young girls.
43:16
And so that was somewhat limiting.
43:21
I remember my classmates very fondly.
43:27
A few of them: David Dolberg is an old friend, an old Jewish friend.
43:31
I remember spending time at his house working on a science fair project.
43:38
The science fair could only have a single person’s name on it and I remember
43:43
that we were working hard at this project when only his name was on it.
43:49
But I remember his house and you know matzah balls and pancakes and bacon.
43:54
I mean how can you have matzah balls and bacon for breakfast, ok?
43:58
[laughs] It’s just really a little bit of how cultural things were.
44:02
But, most of my friends in high school
44:07
were Jewish because most of my classmates in those AP classes were Jewish.
44:15
I had an African American boyfriend; but, David was my run around with,
44:23
let’s do things together friend.
44:26
And I may actually see him in a couple of weeks: we’re going down
44:28
to California and I may look him up.
44:34
I was also, as you have probably seen already, very much, I guess you
44:42
would call me a tomboy at the time.
44:45
Always climbing trees and can see from the pictures that in that day
44:50
and age, you don’t see girls in pants, you see them in dresses.
44:56
Well I couldn’t wait to get home and take of that dress and put on a pair
45:00
of pants and a checkered shirt and go climb around and doing things or go
45:06
across to the playground and do things.
45:09
One other interesting thread and I’m not sure I can think of why
45:16
that thread started or where or how.
45:23
Starting in elementary school I was a graduation speaker.
45:30
I spoke at my
45:34
elementary graduation.
45:37
I spoke at my junior high graduation and I spoke at my high school graduation.
45:44
You were selected?
45:45
I was selected in each sense to do a speech mostly written by myself.
45:50
Was it based on your GPA?
45:52
Was it based on teachers that put your name forward?
45:55
I don’t know.
45:55
In high school I was not the valedictorian.
45:58
We had a class of 500 and I think I was number 50 in it, so
46:05
the top ten percent because of
46:09
those history grades were not quite up there [laughs] and
46:14
neither were the P.E. [laughs] . I
46:22
really don’t know why I was selected on some of those, but I was.
46:25
And so I thought it was really interesting when end up giving the graduate
46:29
commencement address at OSU in 2003 [laughs] . It’s like I sort of skipped my
46:34
own college graduation; but, then I ended up giving a college graduation speech
46:40
anyway [laughs] as a faculty member.
46:42
That’s an interesting one because I don’t remember being particularly outgoing then.
46:54
Although, I find myself, I think I’m fairly outgoing now.
46:59
I think that looking back on my childhood, one other thing that
47:05
does come through it is that because of the variety I had through there.
47:11
It may have helped me to
47:18
see people more as individuals because there was such variety
47:22
there, that I didn’t connect.
47:25
Even though it was a struggle in New York City when I got to Los Angeles and
47:30
there’s some of this variety there might have been a something that happened
47:35
and I just had a variety of friends.
47:38
And I do remember having friends of all different colors
47:44
all through my time in Los Angeles.
47:47
It is extraordinary.
47:51
Okay.
47:52
So when you were in highschool it would have been late 50’s early 60’s?
47:58
Correct.
47:59
And being in L.A. and a big city do you remember having a sense of
48:05
the bigger picture of what was going on in the United States?
48:08
Did you have a television in your home?
48:10
Were you watching television or did you listen to the radio or
48:14
did you talk about it in school?
48:16
It sounds like it was pretty mainstream but do you remember the
48:19
bigger of context of civil rights?
48:22
That’s a good question let me think about it a little bit.
48:24
First of all we had a television very early.
48:27
I think like 1950, which was very early to have a TV, little tiny screen.
48:32
But, I don’t remember watching news on it.
48:36
I remember watching endless cartoons.
48:38
I remember my mother, you know we had all the shows that we watched.
48:42
I don’t remember, probably had a newspaper in the house, but I don’t remember.
48:50
Life magazine, we had that.
48:53
Probably Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, Jet, maybe for a little while.
49:00
I
49:03
don’t think my mother talked about what was happening in the
49:09
larger picture and I don’t think I did either through high school.
49:18
I cannot remember.
49:19
It seems to me we must have.
49:22
But, I don’t remember feeling engaged with the larger issues of
49:28
what was going on until college.
49:31
I think part of it was
49:36
those AP classes and those of us who were in it just focused on getting
49:41
the grades and going on to college.
49:45
We were high schoolers, we were having fun.
49:47
I remember going to the Rose Parade and I remember going to a few
49:54
lectures at some of the universities.
49:57
I remember an academic focus in highschool.
50:02
I think it’s true now that people of different racial
50:06
backgrounds, when they’re together,
50:10
race becomes a taboo topic.
50:13
I think that some of us probably weren’t talking about it in our
50:18
classes very much and teachers were probably just afraid of it too.
50:23
And that many people were talking about it at home but not in my home.
50:28
So, I think it was pretty much over my head, or out of my thoughts, which is
50:35
why I think that going to Berkley in
50:44
1963 was huge.
50:47
Oh, one thing that did happen in my high school which was something that broadened
50:54
my horizons quite a bit is that some
51:01
alumni of Los Angeles High School gave the school a quarter million dollars.
51:08
And starting with our class they took a group, they used the
51:14
interest to take a group of seniors on a trip around California.
51:22
At my reunion I was talking to someone that had been there and
51:26
they remember one of the songs was “We’re traveling, we’re traveling,
51:31
we’re traveling, round California.
51:33
Traveling, we’re traveling, we’re traveling around California by
51:40
the seas and over the rugged mountains, Romans from L.A. High.” Then we had
51:44
a verse about the math teacher, we had a verse about the Hearst Castle,
51:50
we had a verse about San Francisco, we had a verse about everything else.
51:54
And on that trip we visited the University of California at Berkeley.
51:59
And I remember those of us sneaking out at midnight to go to the movie
52:06
theatre and that you had your choice of who happened to be on the bus to
52:10
be your temporary one week girlfriend, boyfriend [laughs] you know how kids are.
52:16
That was pretty interesting.
52:17
Honestly that opened so much of the world for me because I saw so
52:24
much of California from that bus.
52:26
And also, I had a chance I think to have some of these deeper conversations.
52:30
But, I still don’t remember us doing anything that was of social justice,
52:35
political or awareness nature.
52:38
So I did apply to the University of California Berkeley and I believe 13
52:44
students from my high school entered Berkeley at the same time I did.
52:49
And a few of those had been my classmates so I had a little bit of connections then.
52:56
But, I think one of the things that surprised me right away is that
53:05
I realized that my friendships with those in high school had been partly connected
53:11
because of having classrooms together and once we were in a larger world and
53:17
they just dissipated almost immediately.
53:20
I can remember my first roommate who was also named Jeanie.
53:28
And my mother tells a story, she actually wrote it to Readers
53:32
Digest, that when someone would call
53:37
the dorm and ask for Jeanie the operator would say, “Do you want
53:42
Jeanie chocolate or Jeanie vanilla?”
53:49
[laughs] But I remember that she was being rushed for sororities and it
53:54
was never any question; I know that there are sororities, probably even
54:01
then and certainly now, that were integrated. But, at that time there
54:04
was no chance of my being invited to it
54:12
[laughs] . There is a good chance that I just wasn’t the
54:14
type of sorority person anyway.
54:16
It may not have made any difference what color I was because I was not a
54:23
conformer even then.
54:26
One time I did meet with some members of a black sorority that was not
54:35
[living] on campus but was there.
54:37
But, at that time
54:40
all the black women were wearing straight hair, had their hair straight.
54:46
The only women who, black women, who did not wear their hair straight
54:51
were those who were from Africa.
54:55
And you know Odetta, the singer, she was one who we would listen to music
55:00
wise and she wore her hair natural and some of the African women did.
55:05
And as far as I know I was the very first African American woman
55:11
to wear her hair natural at the University of California at Berkeley.
55:15
There was no one else I just decided to do it on my own, cut my hair, that was it.
55:21
So in high school you had been wearing it straight?
55:21
Straight oh yeah.
55:22
But when you got to college you decided to...
55:25
Yeah I did!
55:26
[laughs] My mother hated it so much that when she came to visit
55:30
me she insisted that I wear one of my dorm-mates blonde wig over it
55:37
[laughs] . That was crazy wasn’t it?
55:40
So, I am trying to think of what kinds of influences and what
55:45
kinds of things happened during those first few years at Berkeley.
55:52
Well can we go back just?
55:53
Sure lets go back, anything you want.
55:55
So when you were applying to Berkeley what was it that you wanted to study
55:59
since you were so good at math and science is that what you had in mind
56:06
when you went to college?
56:06
Oh yeah.
56:06
I’ll tell you that journey.
56:08
That’s an easy journey to tell because I have told it before.
56:11
But, the other thing I think to remember; I tell people that I was at
56:14
Berkeley and they go “Wow, you were at Berkeley, that’s a great university.”
56:20
No, no you don’t understand. When I went to Berkeley if you
56:24
had a “B” average you were in.
56:27
That’s all you had to have.
56:28
It was a state school and like some schools still are, they let everyone in
56:35
knowing that what, 20 percent, 30 percent are going to flunk out very quickly.
56:40
And that’s just how it was done, so it wasn’t highly selective then.
56:45
It’s just that’s the school that I chose to go to and it was
56:48
within a day’s drive from my home.
56:52
So,
56:55
you have to realize that I am going from this sort of very closed, protected home
57:01
life, to Berkeley [laughs] . Which, Berkeley I would say had about the same
57:11
ratio of students of color as OSU does now
57:21
or less.
57:22
Yes...or less - it was very white.
57:25
Now it’s pretty integrated but then it was pretty darn white.
57:28
And, I told you that I had trouble writing, I wasn’t a great writer and when
57:36
I took the exam for specifics of where they placed you, my writing skills were
57:47
not good enough get into English 1A.
57:50
I had to take “Subject A” which is the pre-class before you get your skills
57:54
up there and you get into English 1A.
57:56
So that was sort of like a real bummer.
57:58
And then I had taken the AP calculus classes and I was a math /science person.
58:07
And I remember I took the AP test and I didn’t have enough, it wasn’t
58:14
high enough to skip the whole year.
58:18
And I don’t think the way it was set up I could start in the second level, I think
58:22
I had to start at the beginning level.
58:24
So when I went to my advisor I said, “I’ve taken AP calculus got an “A” in it.
58:31
Why should I just start in calculus 1A that’s just going to be lower level?”
58:37
And I said, “Well why don’t I take the honors calculus? That makes sense, I
58:41
will be starting at everyone else.” Well recently I read about someone who
58:46
did a study about African Americans, at Berkeley, at the time I was there.
58:50
Now, I wasn’t a part of the study; but, what they found out was that African
58:53
Americans that went to Berkeley for some reason, I haven’t read the study but it
59:01
was done, thought that they were supposed to succeed on their own with no help.
59:07
So, here I am in this honors calculus section,
59:13
lecture, 300 people.
59:18
I don’t remember seeing one other female.
59:23
I don’t remember seeing one other brown face.
59:26
There were some Asian males, I remember that.
59:31
I am sure there might have been someone else, but that’s what I saw.
59:35
And I didn’t know that in all likelihood I should get a study group going
59:40
[laughs] . And so I didn’t make it.
59:46
I was in honors calculus and at the end of my first quarter [semester] I had a “C” in
59:58
it.
59:59
It was a “C” maybe a “D” I don’t know.
1:00:03
[[] Now at the end of the year, I was still helping my dorm-mates
1:00:08
with their regular calculus.
1:00:10
Because I knew calculus well it was a different level and I had always
1:00:16
managed on my own so I saw no reason to.
1:00:19
And
1:00:21
this is the quarter [semester] that I met my husband, so I had a lot going
1:00:26
and studying was not one of them and I didn’t even know that I needed it.
1:00:32
My first quarter [semester] I got three “C’s” and a “D”.
1:00:39
Now to stay in the University of California at Berkeley
1:00:44
you have to have a “C” average.
1:00:48
So I had to get three “C’s” and a “B” by the end of the next quarter [semester]
1:00:54
. But, by now I had met Robbie; I have a really interesting story that I can read
1:01:00
about our early days [[] together which maybe we will get to if you want it.
1:01:05
But, in that quarter [semester] when I had to bring it up, we had a
1:01:11
motorcycle accident and we were in the hospital at the end of the quarter
1:01:15
[semester] and so I had all Incompletes.
1:01:18
So, I got a letter saying that basically you’re out of Berkeley.
1:01:24
I wrote a letter and I said “Well I was in a motorcycle accident” and they said
1:01:29
“Okay, we will give you to the end of the fall semester to bring your grades up.
1:01:34
To finish your Incompletes; see that they’re up high enough to give you
1:01:39
a “C” average and you can stay in.
1:01:45
So, I tell that story because I was so close to the edge of not making it at all.
1:01:51
And, I also think that as I reflect on that time and what it was like, I think
1:01:59
I understand how important it was to have some academic buddies to help.
1:02:06
In my classrooms I have students facing each other and making connections
1:02:11
because that was not, it still isn’t the normal thing to do for starters
1:02:16
at a university; but, I make sure that it happens in my classes.
1:02:19
I think that’s part of why I did it because of what I saw
1:02:23
happening when I was in college.
1:02:29
One little part about the sororities which might be a detail that some
1:02:34
people don’t know: although by the time I was looking at the black
1:02:40
sororities it was no longer true.
1:02:45
When black sororities were first set up, part of getting into a black sorority was
1:02:54
whether you passed the paper bag test.
1:02:59
If your skin was lighter than a standard paper bag you could get into the
1:03:04
sorority, if it was darker you could not.
1:03:07
Into a black sorority?
1:03:08
Correct.
1:03:12
I would think that it would be the opposite?
1:03:14
Well, you know black is beautiful and that certainly happened during
1:03:18
the time when I was in college.
1:03:20
When I think of the things that happened when I was in college
1:03:25
it’s just absolutely amazing.
1:03:27
We were
1:03:33
both caught up in the beginning stirrings of the Civil Rights
1:03:40
Movement very, very quickly.
1:03:43
We were on the front lines of the Free Speech Movement.
1:03:53
We saw, we began to see what was happening across the United States and in the
1:03:58
South in the Civil Rights Movement there.
1:04:00
We were still being supported by my mother and father, you know
1:04:07
I was a freshman and sophomore.
1:04:09
There is no way I had the means or the way to get on a plane and get there.
1:04:15
So, I think it was very natural to want to get involved in the Free Speech Movement.
1:04:19
So when you say “we” was it the
1:04:23
classmates themselves, the students, was it the teachers, was it the whole culture?
1:04:29
How did you start getting involved and how did that come about?
1:04:34
I think this is probably a good time to look specifically at my
1:04:43
closeness with my husband Robbie because when I say “we” at this point, I am pretty
1:04:50
much talking about my time with him.
1:04:56
Well and you said that he was a historian so he was very interested in that.
1:05:01
Did he ever talk to you about that and that’s when you got more interested?
1:05:06
He was a history major at that time and I think that might have been part of it.
1:05:12
But, I think
1:05:19
that it was more...there was a rumbling of anti-establishment,
1:05:26
anti-money, anti-capitalism which for us was very closely connected
1:05:35
to the Civil Rights Movement.
1:05:36
We didn’t like the world and the government as it was.
1:05:39
That to a large extent was connected to what you could see happening in the South.
1:05:45
But, of course I had seen pieces of that discrimination all through my
1:05:49
life so it wasn’t as if that was as sudden as it was sort of this ground
1:05:54
swell of other things that came up.
1:05:56
I think this might be a good time to talk a little bit about my time with Robbie.
1:06:03
This is from an article called “Homeless, Clueless, in Jail, but Their Love Never
1:06:09
Failed.” This is a poem that Robbie wrote me in February 1964, which is
1:06:16
the era we are talking about right now.
1:06:18
“If I could live on grassy slopes and see the world through pines.
1:06:24
I’d culminate my fondest hopes and build a home, yours and mine.” Now, he would
1:06:31
write me poetry sometimes almost daily and put them under my door or mail them
1:06:37
to me and that was how he courted me.
1:06:39
There was one poem where he said, “If my poetry could grow like the love in
1:06:44
my soul, then the whole world would know Mrs. Robert D. Moule.” It took
1:06:49
me awhile to realize that would be true of anyone that he married, it
1:06:52
didn’t need to be me [laughs] . Ok.
1:06:55
“Most couples remember their first days with misty eyes and pleasant
1:06:59
thoughts. We first set our tear filled eyes on each other the day John F.
1:07:05
Kennedy was shot. We met two weeks later on Pearl Harbor Day, some
1:07:11
might say it’s been a war ever since.
1:07:13
Any relationship begun on those few days has nowhere to go but up.
1:07:19
Through the years we have been homeless, clueless and in jail and at those times
1:07:23
when we’ve had little but each other our marriage has been strengthened.
1:07:26
According to surveys these and other types of causes many marriages to split.
1:07:32
It goes back to the old adage, ‘the difference between an obstacle and a
1:07:36
stepping stone is how high you lift your feet.’ So we took some high
1:07:40
steps beginning with the decision to cross racial barriers to marry.
1:07:45
That probably set the tone for the willingness to give our best
1:07:48
efforts to the problems of marriage.
1:07:51
We were both attending the University of California at Berkeley.
1:07:54
As the news of Kennedy’s assassination swept the campus many students found
1:07:58
their way to the student union.
1:08:00
The chairs and sofas were quickly taken and as the news was broadcast
1:08:04
over the intercom the floor filled up with students as well.
1:08:08
In the midst of floor-to-floor solemn people one man rested
1:08:11
his head on a women’s torso.
1:08:14
An art student at the time, I thought them an interesting picture and
1:08:18
began to draw to pass the time away and take my mind off the tragedy.
1:08:23
Some people may say of their beloved, I loved you before I knew you.
1:08:27
I can say to Rob, ‘I drew you before I knew you.’ Within
1:08:30
days, through a dorm-mate, the woman in the drawing I met Rob.
1:08:35
Fresh from home only two months before, I was smitten by his
1:08:38
poetry which came almost daily.
1:08:41
His poetic muse was short-lived, dying shortly after our wedding although about
1:08:46
every five years he puts his pen to paper.
1:08:48
At the time it was enough to turn the head of a romantically inclined 18 year old.
1:08:54
So was the motorcycle.
1:08:56
Adventure was-ever just one varoom!
1:08:58
away.
1:08:59
By June, we had taken trips to the mountains and the coast and circled the
1:09:02
San Francisco Bay one romantic evening.
1:09:05
We had a head-on with a car, killing the motorcycle and almost ourselves.
1:09:09
My mother said that after the scars on my leg that he had to marry me.
1:09:14
When Rob had graduated from traction to crutches to a cane we both
1:09:18
hobbled over to a bench by the campus stream and became engaged setting a
1:09:21
date for the following June, 1965.
1:09:25
Meanwhile the campus atmosphere was heating up.
1:09:29
By fall we were both involved in the Free Speech Movement on campus.
1:09:33
As skeptical young people we felt strongly that people should be able to speak
1:09:38
their minds, empty though they may be.
1:09:41
We marched into the campus administration building and stayed to be arrested.
1:09:45
We found our pictures on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle
1:09:49
and lost all faith in the news media.
1:09:52
Eventually we lost faith in “the cause.”
1:09:59
In the next first years we picked up our marriage license, a couple of
1:10:02
degrees and a few experiences of being your not-so-typical married-couple.
1:10:07
When we think of our early romantic days one scene stands out.
1:10:11
We were newlyweds traveling to Salt Lake City to meet my father and his
1:10:16
wife to continue by car to the East Coast and the rest of our honeymoon.
1:10:21
On the bus trip, although we had eyes only for each other, we did
1:10:24
notice a women walking the aisles and talking to other passengers.
1:10:29
As she came even with us I heard her say “ ‘And they even have the nerve to
1:10:33
be wearing rings.’ ” We found out later that there was still a law on the books
1:10:37
in Utah, and 26 other states, against miscegenation or mixed marriages.
1:10:44
We decided it was safest to wait in a dark movie theatre for my
1:10:48
parents who were to meet us.
1:10:50
When we went to the hotel we were told there was no record of a
1:10:53
room reserved for us by my father.
1:10:56
We then asked for my parents who should have arrived, the clerk could not find
1:11:00
their name on the registry either.
1:11:02
We slowly walked out of the hotel with little money and no idea of how to
1:11:06
contact my father with the knowledge that we were in an hostile environment.
1:11:11
On our way out we glanced into the hotel dining room, there sat my parents,
1:11:16
eating and waiting for us to arrive.
1:11:18
My father went to the desk and insisted that we be given a room.
1:11:23
My father and his wife had had no problem registering because they were both black.
1:11:28
This time on our honeymoon was the most blatant discrimination
1:11:31
we faced before or since.
1:11:33
Basically we feel that prejudice keeps away from us people that
1:11:37
we probably wouldn’t like anyway.
1:11:40
Later our wanderings brought us up through the West Coast and
1:11:43
through several spiritual searches.
1:11:45
In 1969 we found ourselves near Silverton, long-haired, long-skirted
1:11:52
hippies expecting our first child.”
1:11:58
So can I go back to a couple of things?
1:12:00
Sure.
1:12:00
I wanted to go back to the fact that you got an art degree.
1:12:03
So how did that come about and what inspired you to art?
1:12:07
Well, the math and science wasn’t working.
1:12:13
Then I took a philosophy class and I loved philosophy.
1:12:17
I wrote a paper called “Unity in Multiplicity” for my Philosophy 6A class.
1:12:23
And that Professor Firerobin was the first professor that I ever
1:12:28
really sat down and talked to.
1:12:30
Even though I remember his conversation “Why do you want to study philosophy,
1:12:34
why don’t you just have kids and settle down” but he still gave me an “A” which
1:12:39
was my first “A” in college, [laughs] so I wanted to know about this man.
1:12:43
First,
1:12:45
I wanted to do my strength and then I wanted to figure out all of life
1:12:52
and the universe through philosophy.
1:12:56
And the next thing I went into was psychology because I think
1:13:01
I wanted to figure out myself.
1:13:03
And then I got into art which was basically I was just going to express
1:13:07
myself [laughs] . So, it was just a journey and I am sure that a lot of it
1:13:13
was connected to my growing identity.
1:13:18
I mean I went from, I entered college at 17 years old, that’s
1:13:23
young, with very little to see.
1:13:27
And then I meet the love of my life almost immediately so
1:13:33
there is so much to be done there and there was so much happening,
1:13:38
not just the Free Speech movement.
1:13:41
I remember when I was in Berkeley there were several times when
1:13:46
we went to meetings where the Black Panthers were there.
1:13:50
Huey Newton, I mean I met some of them.
1:13:53
And one time when I was out going over to the bay area someone asked me if I was
1:13:59
Angela Davis because I had the natural.
1:14:01
She had a natural, a very big natural by then.
1:14:05
I remember marching to a park with Joan Baez and dancing in the Fillmore
1:14:14
with her sister and her husband.
1:14:18
One of the other earlier things, we used to go out to the small, small place in the
1:14:27
country with this band that would play.
1:14:30
We would go out there and there might be 30 people and
1:14:33
they’d play and we would dance.
1:14:35
It was the Grateful Dead when they were only playing to a handful of
1:14:39
people and we knew; Robbie knew them.
1:14:45
There was a lot happening then.
1:14:47
We were really into Bob Dylan.
1:14:49
And so, I sort of went from doing my art, doing my strength.
1:14:57
Where was that going to lead?
1:14:59
The philosophy I am sure was highly connected to the whole
1:15:06
New Age, bigger-picture movement that was happening then.
1:15:12
But, the thought of how our brains work and what makes us tick and
1:15:19
all that stuff in psychology, then that became very, very interesting to me.
1:15:24
But, then I took one or two art classes and I really liked expressing myself.
1:15:29
I remember just having a sort of epiphany once with an art teacher,
1:15:36
Robert Hartman that really touched me.
1:15:39
And then, I think there’s this sort of non-judgmental whatever you create
1:15:44
and put up there could be seen.
1:15:47
And then I also realized, I think at that time, I’m getting back into it now
1:15:54
then into, I guess I’m in retirement [laughs] that I had some talent in it.
1:16:02
So, that was beginning to come through and I just ended up with an
1:16:09
art major and a psychology minor.
1:16:11
But, first freshman was math and science, then philosophy right away.
1:16:18
I think I went into psychology as a sophomore and I didn’t get into an art
1:16:25
major until I was a junior or a senior.
1:16:28
So it definitely changed and I was married between my sophomore and junior
1:16:33
year, so that was key then in hanging out with a lot of different people and
1:16:43
totally immersed in a Berkeley lifestyle.
1:16:46
One
1:16:49
of my political things, about that time, we were a part of Students for
1:16:59
a Democratic Society, or SNIC [it was the Peace and Freedom Party] . I
1:17:01
don’t remember [laughs] it was some radical left wing movement.
1:17:06
We were politically so far left that the Democratic and
1:17:11
Republicans were both to the right.
1:17:14
I mean really they were out there, we were obviously,
1:17:22
tear down the walls [laughs] . But, I was doing some campaigning for a local
1:17:32
legislator in Oakland because we lived on the other side of line of
1:17:39
Berkeley-Oakland over a gay bar.
1:17:42
We lived over the Berkeley-Oakland boundary.
1:17:47
And I was campaigning in Oakland and I was walking down the street
1:17:53
knocking and leaving campaign literature and I went door to door.
1:17:57
And I noticed this guy in this old, sort of dirty, white
1:18:05
station wagon.
1:18:06
I’d see him and he would sort of be looking at me and then I be
1:18:09
around and I would see him again, wondering what this guy was doing.
1:18:13
Finally, he stopped his car in the street and sort of waved me over; so I
1:18:17
go over and we start talking and he said,
1:18:23
we saw that we were about the same political stripe and he said
1:18:25
“Do you think you could pass out my literature I’m running for
1:18:30
mayor?” And it was Jerry Rubin.
1:18:33
And it’s interesting to me, of course I don’t tell that story to my students
1:18:37
anymore because they don’t know who Jerry Rubin is [laughs] . But,
1:18:43
as someone that was active in that political pushing against things that
1:18:50
we didn’t like, and honestly I think at that time for me the specifics
1:18:56
on the Civil Rights Movement and the discrimination against African
1:19:02
Americans was part of a larger picture that I was seeing and I just didn’t
1:19:08
like the way the world was being run.
1:19:10
And I didn’t like the capitalism.
1:19:13
You might have called me...
1:19:17
I’m not going to say communistic because I don’t think I knew enough about it
1:19:21
politically, but the idea of living on a commune where you’re working together and
1:19:27
you’re sharing things and you’re giving freely of your gifts to other people
1:19:32
and everybody eats, everybody works.
1:19:36
There is something there, I found that very enticing and I think that
1:19:43
that equalitarian idea and commonality and sharing of our gifts, more than
1:19:51
any specific political leaning.
1:19:55
It
1:19:58
still permeates how I teach; of
1:20:03
course it is certainly there in cultural competence that I do.
1:20:09
So can you tell me a little bit more about the Free Speech Movement and
1:20:12
then the excerpt from the article that you read I heard the word
1:20:16
“disillusioned.” Can you talk a little bit about how you came about with that
1:20:20
movement and then what became of that?
1:20:23
Well, I think that
1:20:27
we were ground troops.
1:20:28
We weren’t, I remember one time we ended up in a car for some reason with Mario
1:20:33
Salvia, but, we were not in the leadership of that at all, we were simple followers.
1:20:39
But, we believed in it and we did we went in to sit-ins.
1:20:44
There’s a picture of us on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle sitting
1:20:47
underneath one of the registration tables.
1:20:50
And we’re doing our homework while people are standing up on the tables
1:20:54
looking around, but we didn’t leave.
1:20:56
We were arrested, and I think the disillusioning part was feeling that
1:21:03
we hadn’t really made a difference.
1:21:05
And that it had disrupted our personal lives quite a bit because of it.
1:21:11
And for me personally I remember when we got out of jail someone had
1:21:17
a copy of the New York Times on that day and remember that we are just
1:21:23
sort of no bodies in the background.
1:21:26
But, some people were more in front as leaders.
1:21:28
And they’re reading this article and one of them says to another, “Who
1:21:32
Jean Golson?” And I go, “What?” And I look over their shoulder and on the
1:21:38
news article in the New York Times for some reason out of 800 people
1:21:43
arrested and they had chosen my name.
1:21:46
And the story in there wasn’t my story, it wasn’t my arrest.
1:21:52
And I think that’s the first time that I, and it’s pretty early, to have
1:21:57
something that specific where you knew the media wasn’t telling you the truth.
1:22:02
‘Cause I knew that wasn’t my story.
1:22:04
In the New York Times article the person arrested...when they came to arrest
1:22:10
me it was trespassing and what was it?...there were three different things
1:22:17
that we were accused of...disturbing the peace and trespassing, or something.
1:22:23
Anyway, and then if you didn’t get up and walk away you got arrested for
1:22:34
resisting arrest.
1:22:35
Well I didn’t get up, I was carried.
1:22:41
The story in the New York Times had the person getting up and walking
1:22:44
out, so I knew it wasn’t mine they had just picked a name for some reason.
1:22:49
And
1:22:54
it was just the bureaucracy of it all.
1:22:57
I remember just recently I was reading someone who
1:23:04
left Berkeley for some of the same reasons that we protested then.
1:23:14
And it’s just that the bureaucracy is so massive and you wonder if you
1:23:24
can make any difference by knocking hard on the door or being arrested.
1:23:29
And I think I came to believe at that point that what we did, while it sort
1:23:35
of moved things along and it maybe did “x.” In the big scheme of things, I
1:23:44
think that those who stay in the system and work to change it may have a better
1:23:50
chance of making a difference as far as influence is concerned. And I would say
1:23:57
that’s probably why I eventually went on to finish my degrees and do what I do
1:24:05
now, in the sense that I can work in it.
1:24:09
One body on the line for an extra arrestee is not as influential as writing a book
1:24:17
and having students that I can talk to and individually help them come to some
1:24:22
more connections about what’s happening.
1:24:24
So I think that it was just
1:24:28
that that happened in the Free Speech Movement for me.
1:24:31
It’s all said and done I have an arrest record which I still
1:24:35
have to answer to occasionally.
1:24:38
But, did my extra body on the line, my sister in law she was in the
1:24:43
thing when it came to you being arrested she went home, you know
1:24:49
[laughs] . Not too many years ago my son noticed that the Free Speech Movement
1:24:54
was trying to find the arrestees and he saw that our name wasn’t on there so
1:24:59
he made sure that we would get on it.
1:25:01
Every month or so I get email from the Free Speech, FSMer’s we’re
1:25:06
called and just last year for the first time I went back on campus and
1:25:10
now there’s an FSM café on campus.
1:25:14
But, this young woman who left the university recently said, “Here
1:25:18
are these people that stood against the bureaucracy trying to make a
1:25:22
change and now what’s happening?
1:25:25
There’s a café there.” When I was on campus there was this really
1:25:30
huge rally, I couldn’t believe it.
1:25:33
Thousands and thousands of students marching five and six abreast across
1:25:37
campus and they had all these signs up and it was about the tuition
1:25:41
raise [laughs] . You’re fighting because the tuition was raised?
1:25:43
Okay, I get that.
1:25:44
But we were fighting because
1:25:50
we believe that our fundamental rights to speak in public were being
1:25:58
curtailed, that people couldn’t say what they wanted to say on campus.
1:26:04
And so, did that make a difference?
1:26:07
You know, it’s hard to judge.
1:26:09
I’ve never really thought back to it and to judge it any more.
1:26:12
But it
1:26:20
had an impact obviously and then now especially you were saying that the
1:26:26
way that you approach education and how working in the system from within.
1:26:32
I think it has.
1:26:34
But, then was it Mario Salvia that said “Never trust anyone
1:26:37
over 30?” And so, we were.
1:26:45
I think it might be good to finish this part about my husband and I, that I
1:26:54
started about our love, and it’s personal but I think it’s a good place to be.
1:27:02
And maybe close to where we should end, we should see.
1:27:07
Because I started talking about our love and I started with the poem.
1:27:11
“In Silverton we received a surprising welcome from some rural folks
1:27:15
who were not afraid to offer us unconditional love in the name of God.
1:27:20
Eventually we ended out spiritual journey,“ [which by the way
1:27:25
included transcendental meditation while we were in Berkeley], “by
1:27:29
returning to our Christian roots.
1:27:31
At this point our marriage became stronger because of Jesus Christ.
1:27:36
Would there have been the time of near separation, the temptation
1:27:40
of drugs, the drop out years if we had found the Lord earlier?
1:27:46
If we had to do it all over again we’d take Jesus every day of our lives.
1:27:51
On the lighter side, if Rob has a garden, a library and a crossword
1:27:55
puzzle he had everything he needs.
1:27:58
I like people and challenges in general.
1:28:02
Together we travel, ski, and enjoy fellowship.
1:28:07
Two of our three children who became the focus of our close marriage blessed
1:28:10
us with a card on a recent anniversary.
1:28:13
One son said, ‘If I try to draw a picture of how much the two of you
1:28:16
love each it would take a lot more hearts than what’s shown on this card.
1:28:21
When I talk to my friends and they tell me the stories of their divorced
1:28:25
parents I am grateful to you for being together and a solid family.
1:28:29
Twenty-seven years is quite a feat by today’s standards.’ The other son
1:28:35
added, ‘What is most important to me now is knowing wherever I am, I can
1:28:40
always come home or call home and find two loving and supportive parents.
1:28:44
That number “two” is so important to me.
1:28:47
People have told me they almost can’t believe what a relationship the two
1:28:51
of you have and I realize now how fortunate I really am.’ This is another
1:28:56
poem written in February 14, 1994 right about when I wrote this article.
1:29:03
“The love we’ve shared since ‘63 has grown beyond just you and me. Our
1:29:09
three beige babes have left the nest and the years ahead may be the best.”
