00:01
My name is Jean Moule.
00:03
It is May 8th 2012.
00:07
I am sitting in my study surrounded by memories and lots and lots of books
00:14
and articles from my time at OSU which is the subject of today’s interview.
00:22
So what brought you to OSU?
00:24
What about OSU and specifically the program interested you?
00:29
Well you know I finished the last interview surrounded by the albums and the
00:33
pictures from our family and talked about the church in our home and my volunteer
00:40
work and education up until then.
00:43
Here I was, home, family, lots of experience with education and
00:48
then Oregon State University.
00:51
We had a third set
00:52
of families living with us with young children.
00:56
Perhaps I needed an excuse to move away from those pressures
00:59
and embrace the academic world.
01:02
I had already expanded my physical capacity by joining ski patrol,
01:06
participating in Masters Track and Field and running a marathon.
01:09
What about my brain?
01:13
Do you recall any preconceived notions about OSU or the town
01:17
of Corvallis before you came?
01:20
Well, I considered OSU a “cow town,” holding little intellectual light and
01:27
diverse community surroundings that would suit me compared to University
01:31
of Oregon, the Berkeley of the North, and the site of my master’s degree.
01:36
And part of the answer about why I came to OSU was that a colleague in
01:42
Talented and Gifted Education from U of O urged me to apply to the
01:47
doctoral program in teacher leadership.
01:50
She had already set up an appointment for me to meet the director
01:53
and his assistant for lunch.
01:55
And I had all of three days to complete the application.
01:59
What did I have to lose?
02:02
Lots.
02:03
At the time I thought I would just be a PhD student for the rest of my life.
02:08
I remember going to my application interview with my leg in a cast from my
02:14
severed achilles tendon from the last day of my ski patrol candidate year [there
02:20
went forever my marathon-level training].
02:23
I remember Bonnie Morihara, a doctoral student herself, bustling into the
02:28
room full of cheer and welcome.
02:31
Little did I know that our paths would connect so completely and that
02:34
she would become my best friend.
02:38
I came to OSU because I was recruited.
02:41
I stayed because I felt I was needed.
02:46
Knowing Corvallis better did not change my mind about its makeup.
02:49
I believe my initial thoughts about the students and the faculty, land grant,
02:54
mostly rural students and unexamined liberal faculty, stayed about the same.
03:00
I was just more vulnerable to these realities as I became a
03:03
student and then a professor.
03:07
Were you actively involved in campus activities and groups as a student?
03:12
As a graduate student, I was active in the Black Graduate Student Association.
03:17
I remember meeting some wonderful people at these events and feeling that some
03:22
of my concerns about OSU were shared.
03:25
One comment will live in my memory.
03:27
A woman said, “Many universities have a low level of expectations for black
03:32
students. OSU has a low expectation for black students and those students
03:40
believe it.” I would say that my son and daughter-in-law who both
03:45
entered the PhD program briefly saw that very quickly and they got out.
03:52
Most people of African descent in Oregon are used to working in environments where
03:57
they may be the sole person of color.
04:01
But there was something about the overwhelming and acceptance of whiteness
04:05
and white norms in Corvallis that was very difficult and there was no
04:10
easy way to find a black peer group.
04:13
Fortunately for me, I was quickly introduced to “Pearls of Wisdom” a Black
04:18
women’s group in the Corvallis community.
04:21
There were a few Black students and faculty in this group,
04:25
most were community members.
04:27
I became friends with the prominent organizer of this group and stayed
04:31
often in her home while I was a student.
04:34
My friend/colleague Bonnie and I would work out in Dixon, mostly swimming in
04:40
adjacent lanes and discussing our work.
04:43
During this time I also competed in an OSU sprint [meaning short]
04:47
triathlon [I will do my second and last in a few days, May 19, 2012].
04:57
Were there any incidents or controversies on campus that occurred
05:01
in relation to multicultural issues?
05:03
Do you recall the mass walkout of the mid 1990s?
05:07
Well, in the student boycott in1996,
05:12
I relished walking with thousands during that time.
05:18
I actually wrote about it in an article that I have.
05:24
I said, “In February 1996, the increasing incidents of verbal and written racial
05:30
slurs on campus alarm some people.
05:33
At this time, the African American student population of Oregon State University
05:37
was about 160 students or 1.2 percent.
05:42
The turning point in campus and community passivity came after students
05:46
on a dormitory balcony verbally harassed and attempted to urinate
05:50
on an African American student.
05:52
This incident resulted in a campus wide boycott of classes, a march, and a rally.
05:58
At least 2,000 students and community members participated in these events.
06:04
The students who accosted the African American student were arrested.”
06:10
Having been arrested in the Free Speech Movement and doing a regular solo picket
06:14
of Planned Parenthood, I had experience taking a stand against the grain or
06:22
participating in civil disobedience.
06:25
It was one of the times I probably felt most integrated on campus!
06:31
I have a photo of my walking with colleagues and my son, Michael, who
06:36
happened to be on campus that day.
06:44
So do you recall your feelings or specific experiences regarding
06:48
how you were treated on campus?
06:51
A few other overtly racist incidences do come to my mind, but the
06:56
covert ones were much, much worse.
06:59
For the openly racist ones, I recalled being called the “n” word from a car
07:05
driving by in front of Education Hall.
07:08
I remember a time of discrimination regarding a test; this was
07:12
when I was a graduate student.
07:15
I had given the same answer as a friend, yet somehow received a lower grade.
07:21
Judy and I enjoyed each other’s company, as we were the oldest
07:23
two people in our cohort.
07:25
She was so much fun.
07:27
However, something in our relationship was not quite right and I understood
07:32
it later when I read one of her regular columns in the Barometer, the campus
07:36
newspaper: She had had maids living in her home when she was growing up.
07:40
Needless to add, they were black.
07:42
So I think that having me as a black colleague may have brought
07:46
up some of those feelings for her.
07:48
But we were close and we were close enough to share our midterm grades
07:52
and papers, the tests, that day in a difficult statistics course.
07:59
[By the way, I could never have earned a doctorate if there was still
08:02
a foreign language requirement].
08:04
Anyway, she had a B on the test and I had a C. We carefully examined our
08:07
papers and saw that our answers and work on one we had missed [received
08:11
partial credit] were nearly identical.
08:13
When I made an appointment and shared this with the professor,
08:16
he quickly changed my grade.
08:18
I believe I said to him that after I graduated we would be colleagues
08:22
and I would like our relationship to begin on a better basis.
08:27
Um, I entered OSU as an expert in talented and gifted education.
08:34
I will pause in my story to read a list of some of my connections and service
08:42
from my Current Vita.
08:44
I was a leader
08:55
in many professional organizations both before I got to OSU and when I was at OSU.
09:01
I particularly remember being invited by Susan Castillo, state superintendent of
09:07
public instruction, to be a member of the professional educator advisory team and
09:14
went to Salem once a quarter for those.
09:18
As an active member in the Oregon chapter of NAME [National Association
09:21
for Multicultural Education], I was a conference chair in 2005.
09:25
And the organization went underground for a few years and I helped bring it back to
09:32
the surface with some colleagues at OSU and also at other universities in Oregon.
09:41
I helped do the bias review for the Oregon Educator License Assessments.
09:46
I was invited at
09:50
a seminar on cultural competency in Oregon.
09:53
I did planning for the Oregon Association for Teacher Education
09:58
meeting…I know I’m missing a lot.
10:00
But I worked outside of the campus quite a bit.
10:05
And of course did reviewing for two of the very popular books in my field,
10:12
Multicultural Education by Jim Banks and another by Valerie Pang and of
10:17
course review manuscripts for a number of journals, the Journal of Teacher
10:25
Education, Excellence in Education, Teacher Education Quarterly, Urban
10:29
Education, Teacher Education and Practice, and the Journal of Negro Education.
10:34
And besides speaking of course and taking care of my own classes, I spoke
10:40
at Corbin College, I presented at Middle Schools, and presented at Lane Community
10:50
College and through all this I was serving as a volunteer ski patroller.
10:56
Interestingly, the awards I have gotten have been through that event
11:02
for saving a life on the patrol.
11:06
I’ll get to some of the other things as I go over.
11:09
But I did want to get a few specifics from my curriculum, from my CV.
11:15
My first idea when I got to OSU for a dissertation was how people
11:22
move from novice to expert.
11:24
I was not involved in multicultural education at all.
11:28
I was going to use my own journey from getting my first llama to
11:34
selling the llamas and I was learning and being interviewed on how to
11:40
use llamas as guards for sheep.
11:45
I even spoke to someone in animal sciences in preparation for this work.
11:50
I saw this movement from novice to expert as a key part of education
11:54
and thought this would be fun.
11:58
And, during, my first year at OSU I took a course in teaching.
12:03
I recently found the folder that talked about this.
12:06
I used this image for this class, this prototype class, a tree.
12:13
And I saw the roots in it as being the environment, social, the dialogue between
12:21
people, and wanted to base education for students on this growth model.
12:32
So here I have this land based coming in, living in a clearing
12:40
in the woods and having llamas.
12:41
And I get to OSU and what happens?
12:46
I was very quickly asked to intern in the course Multicultural Issues in Education.
12:54
Now, I had never taken a course myself in that area and had zero
13:00
background or knowledge in it.
13:02
Quite obviously, I was asked to teach it because I was of African descent.
13:08
At one point I asked an administrator that point blank.
13:12
I still can’t believe how he squirmed before reluctantly saying “yes.” My
13:18
mentor and major professor, Warren Suzuki, now deceased after retiring to
13:23
his birthplace, Hawaii, supported me in my efforts to learn about this field.
13:28
He was a wonderful mentor as he was so much a guide on the side.
13:34
My first mentor at OSU had left for a year and I am very glad she did.
13:39
She was a sage on the stage.
13:41
I remember I worked with her on a paper and she took me through nine revisions.
13:46
Surely one can convey all that is needed in one or two sessions.
13:51
Eight is just cruel….
13:52
I was never that bad of a writer.
13:57
Back to the course though, my first experience with this course was a
14:01
two and a half week summer session.
14:04
And Warren and I, he pretty much gave me freedom of it, helped me out when
14:10
I had questions, but he left me on my own to figure out this new material.
14:17
I very quickly refused to do a class of that nature in such a short time
14:23
because it was just too much to process.
14:29
So actually I wanted to go back to a couple of things
14:33
that you talked about earlier.
14:35
In relation to the boycott that you participated in, I’m interested to hear
14:41
your thoughts on your role in this protest considering that you were such an active
14:50
protestor in your undergrad years, in the sixties, and now decades later, you
14:55
decided to participate in this walkout.
14:59
Did your thoughts change?
15:01
Decades later, I remember you talking about in an earlier interview how you
15:05
sort of felt that the activism of the sixties that you felt like you were
15:10
one person out of many and it wasn’t quite making the difference you wanted.
15:14
Did that change years later?
15:16
Did you feel that boycott made a difference?
15:20
Oh, at OSU?
15:22
Like I said, it was one of the first times that I felt like this is what you’re
15:27
supposed to do, you’re to act when you feel strongly on what was happening.
15:31
And it was nice to see people on the campus getting up and moving.
15:35
I mean, I still will get up and go for myself to move, but by becoming
15:41
a professor, I was in a position of influence in teaching my students.
15:47
And that’s why I thought why being part of the protest was a nice
15:56
reflection back on my earlier times.
16:00
I think that in some ways for me it confirmed to me that I needed to work
16:06
against the grain in my teaching.
16:09
And as far as the campus thing….it seems like it cyclical, I don’t know…I think
16:16
as I’m going to get to later, I think that what happens in a lot of situations
16:21
like this, you have those kind of activism and people start talking how
16:26
they want to make a difference because they want to see this kind of thing
16:30
happen again, but then they sort of slide back and things go back into this
16:36
unconscious bias and unintentional racism, which is where my work is right now.
16:47
So, actually, since you mentioned at the time of the walkout, you
16:51
were a professor already in 1996?
16:54
No, I was still a student.
16:56
So at that time you were still a student.
16:58
So can you talk a little about your transition from student to professor?
17:04
What were the dates that you were in the program and then what year
17:07
did you become a professor and how did that transition come about?
17:12
Okay well, I entered OSU as a student in fall 1995.
17:21
I defended my dissertation in December 1997.
17:28
This is a very quick transition.
17:31
Now of course, for education, you enter with your master’s degree
17:35
which is a lot of coursework.
17:38
And my husband, not myself, figured out very early that I
17:42
was a “grow your own” candidate.
17:43
OSU had so much trouble attracting and keeping minority faculty that the school
17:48
of education recruited myself and a Latino to enter the doctoral program,
17:55
graduate, and hopefully join the faculty.
17:59
Now, I can say with confidence that this is a bad idea.
18:02
No matter how much faculty thinks differently, an individual moving
18:07
from student to faculty will be at a disadvantage from respect
18:12
versus one found through search.
18:14
Lots of people on OSU’s faculty received their PhDs from OSU.
18:18
However, they went somewhere else for a couple of years before returning to OSU.
18:23
However, I was place-bound on a four-acre property an hour from campus.
18:27
I had no intentions of moving out into a wider academic world once
18:31
I graduated, though I did consider Willamette so close to home.
18:36
But by then, I so loved research that an institution that did not have
18:41
that focus had less appeal to me.
18:43
And, besides, I
18:47
didn’t complete my application
19:08
there.
19:08
Phone Rings
19:09
My sense from several faculty members at the school of education was that
19:13
graduate students were simply “lower class” and what you did before you entered
19:17
the program was not well- respected.
19:19
It could be that I was drawn into my field because of the rotten attitudes I sensed.
19:25
Was it because I was a student that I was treated differently
19:28
or because I was black?
19:30
Actually, sometimes I think it was because I was a Christian.
19:33
Unbelievably, I had two professors on my first day in their class make a comment
19:38
about how they had trouble working with Christians or something like that.
19:43
One of the stories that happened that first year: I was in a class
19:51
where a teacher showed us a film of a gay/lesbian group on Harvard campus
20:02
that was confronting with a conservative Christian group on Harvard campus.
20:09
And I remember looking at the pictures; one group, the conservative
20:15
Christians are all white males [laughs] and the gay/lesbian group
20:19
is nicely diverse with females in it.
20:21
And just looking at the two groups, which one was I attracted to.
20:26
But I remember the instructor who later became a colleague said, “If
20:34
you can’t talk about these differences now, in graduate school, when can
20:38
you talk about them?” So we were silent, we weren’t ready to jump into
20:43
it… and finally I got brave enough.
20:46
And the next week, this is what I said in class, I said, “Billy Graham was
20:53
in town last week and someone asked him whether homosexuality was a sin.
21:02
And Billy Graham said ‘Homosexuality is one of many sins, the greatest
21:10
of which is self righteousness.’”
21:16
Now, that quote says to me, that someone who would judge people is
21:24
much more at fault than what they would be judging about. But the
21:29
people in the class didn’t hear that.
21:34
They said, outside of the class, “Jean says homosexuality is a sin.” That was
21:43
repeated at a faculty meeting and the rhetoric in the meeting, which I heard
21:49
from three different people, was that someone said that hiring me, having me go
21:55
from doctoral student to faculty, because of that quote unquote statement quote
22:02
would be the same as hiring a racist.
22:05
That was the statement they made.
22:07
And over the next two years, I had
22:12
coffee or lunch with at least three people who were in that faculty
22:16
meeting because they wanted to know, they wanted to ask me that.
22:21
And, first of all, I repeated it, and I said, “The point of that quote is
22:27
that you’re not to judge people. And all you’re taking is the first part of
22:31
that…and not only that, I was quoting him!
22:34
And I was trying to get people to a higher view and you’re bringing it down to that
22:41
level?” And this is how I explained it, I said, “I believe that sexual relationships
22:49
are best expressed in marriage.
22:54
I had twenty-something year old kids who are not married and they are having sex.
23:04
Now, do I love them?
23:07
Yes, I love them.” So my statement has nothing to do
23:13
with how I would love someone.
23:14
I’m only called to love people, I’m not called to judge people.
23:17
So why should that quote say anything to you about how I would treat students?
23:26
In fact, if you look at Jesus’ walk on this earth, he loved people more if
23:34
he thought they were in need of love.
23:36
And so, if anything, if you do decide I do have that bias, I’m going to
23:43
love my gay/lesbian students who come into my room more because I would
23:48
think that they would need it more.
23:50
I don’t think that the people who I shared it with ever got that.
23:54
And I think that was, to this day, one of the harshest things, for me, about
24:01
being at OSU, is that once people put you in a box, there’s nothing you can
24:07
say, there’s nothing you can do, and never ever was there a time that I was
24:16
told that I treated someone badly because quote unquote I thought they weren’t
24:23
doing what I thought they ought to do morally, so that was pretty darn painful.
24:34
Now, to enter a doctoral program of three years minimum intense work
24:38
an hour’s drive from my home was quite a radical choice at age 49.
24:44
The doors were opening and I had quite a bit of peace.
24:48
But there was a piece that was spiritually connected that I’d like to share.
24:54
First of all, we had this church in our home and we have a full gospel,
25:02
you know sometimes you get dreams and visions and you share them.
25:07
And for a full year before I went to OSU, there was this one section in
25:17
Ephesians that’s called “putting on God’s armor to resist the enemy when he
25:22
attacks and when it’s all over you’ll be standing up.” And for a year, I
25:26
would get incredible stories or insights into each piece of this armor of God.
25:34
And I would share with people, and it was, let’s see, “put on a belt of truth,
25:41
put on a breastplate or righteousness, work shoes that can speed you to preach
25:47
good news, have a shield of faith to keep the arrows from getting at you,
25:53
have on a helmet of salvation and a sword, which is the Word of God, the
26:03
truth about His love.” So, it wasn’t until I got to OSU that I realized that
26:11
I was being armored for the front line.
26:15
And
26:18
that all that year of preparation, to a large point…as I said the very first
26:25
day, when I was in class and someone says…some Christians have difficulty
26:34
with my teaching…and I’m going, “Why should that come up on the first level?”
26:39
But the very first outcome for the PhD program said something to the effect
26:45
was that being in the program, you would transcend your personal belief
26:51
system. Why that would be the very first thing listed in a PhD program still
26:57
escapes me completely. I don’t get.
27:03
But, as you might have guessed, there were times, especially during those first
27:06
couple of months, where I questioned this choice, and finally… I’m not the kind
27:13
of person that asks for signs…but in my prayers, I was getting to the point where
27:21
I needed just a little more support.
27:23
So,
27:25
I just said, “Lord, I’ve gotta have something.” I was on campus and I was
27:32
just getting ready to do a presentation and I had lots and lots of props
27:36
and I was going up and down from my car upstairs and one time as a I was
27:41
headed back downstairs towards my car, I looked toward the recycling area.
27:46
And, by the way, one time they were getting rid of hundreds of file folders.
27:52
They were just trashing them, and I still have a foot stack at home that I reuse,
27:58
so I’m always going to be looking over to recycle, and there was this sign,
28:06
a piece of board with its back towards me, and I went over and I picked up the
28:12
sign [laughs] and I picked it up and the sign said, “School of Education.” And, you
28:19
understand, when you ask the Lord for a sign, you not asking for a literal sign.
28:24
I got a literal sign and I picked it up and this thought came through my
28:31
head that was, “I’ve given you the school of education.” Now, I gotta
28:37
tell you, when you hear something like that, your feet get a little shaky.
28:42
You try to take a deep breath and you try to stand where you are.
28:46
And I shook my head and went on.
28:49
And I did not pay very much attention to that.
28:53
But, when I look back at my time at the school of education, there
28:59
are a few things that happened that I still can’t believe happened.
29:05
As a doctoral student, as an assistant professor there were times when I had a
29:10
larger role then you would ever expect.
29:14
And I’m going to end this session with reading the time that I
29:22
gave the commencement address.
29:24
So, assistant professor is asked to give a commencement address to the
29:29
graduate students and their parents.
29:32
I mean, that’s an incredible role, to walk into graduation right
29:36
behind the university president.
29:39
And I just shake my head, I mean, why, how did I get there?
29:44
Some of the other things that happened is that I was asked to be
29:49
part of the redesign committee led by George Copa for our school when
29:58
we were redesigned and then Tim White asked me to be on the selection
30:06
committee for the Dean of the College.
30:10
We’ve got
30:12
another Dean and a full professor and me and those two positions were very
30:22
formative in the school/college of education, so they sort of fit in with
30:29
the sign thing that I got.
30:34
My challenges, I believe, often pushed the college to more
30:42
cultural competence in general.
30:44
And, eventually, my sad time through the P and T process, which I’ll talk
30:49
to you about, made its way about to Sabah and Ed Ray and influenced not
30:58
only my college but other colleges.
31:01
And then, this is really funny, you realized that the year that I left,
31:10
the school of education, the building itself was gutted [laughs] . Now,
31:17
again, I’m just taking a step back…you can make anything that you want of it.
31:24
I always felt both humbled and very inadequate for the
31:31
role, that that sign pertained.
31:33
I
31:35
also know that because of the sign and because of my specific feelings that
31:40
I was to be at OSU, I didn’t leave it lightly, I left when my husband retired.
31:51
We’ll talk about that in a little bit.
31:55
So, now that you, when you became a professor, can you talk about
31:59
what kinds of courses you taught?
32:01
And, if you had control over the content of your courses?
32:09
And can you specifically talk about Multicultural Issues in
32:12
Education and Multicultural Issues in Educational Settings?
32:17
And based on your work with your students, did you course content change over time?
32:24
And if so, how?
32:25
And also, what did you learn from your students?
32:31
Teaching a course in a field new to me was a challenge.
32:35
I used a basic book by James Banks at first and I quickly
32:40
began to draw in speakers.
32:42
One of the ones was Susan from Sesame Street… Dr. Loretta Long.
32:47
I brought her to campus…I was still a student when I did this
32:51
actually, because remember I started teaching this class while I was
32:54
a student and just moved onto it.
32:57
So, for myself, when I look back at the course, I don’t remember going
33:01
from graduate student to professor in that course, because that course
33:05
just kept on going, so it really wasn’t a very strong change for it.
33:10
But I brought people in…Dr.
33:13
Loretta Long, James Loewen, and panels in my class.
33:20
When I needed help
33:24
in my classes, I really enjoyed working with Wayne Haverson.
33:29
He is a kind, thoughtful man.
33:32
He thought that I was exposing myself too much in some of my work.
33:35
Yet I felt that unless I shared my heart and was authentic,
33:38
how could I ask students to be?
33:42
Over time I came to see that our main text needed to be more Oregon based
33:48
[Oregon’s a predominately white state] and it needed to include the psychological
33:53
journey of taking the course.
33:55
And then the opportunity to write opened up for me, I’ll
34:01
talk about that a little later.
34:03
During this time I
34:09
first interned and then taught alone ED 313: Trends and Issues in Education.
34:15
The overlap of material was great, about the only thing that
34:19
I covered in this one and not in multicultural issues was school reform.
34:22
I headed up ED 309 for a couple of years.
34:26
That was the course for school placements and got me out into
34:30
most of the schools in Corvallis.
34:32
So I was able to see those schools first hand.
34:34
One story that I think about that affected how I saw myself in the university
34:41
and the community and also how others saw me was I had my interns that I was
34:47
supervising spread over many schools and then I was going to schools with
34:53
this packet for putting undergraduate students into schools for a bit of time.
34:59
And I remember once going into this school and there was no one in the
35:03
front office so I went to the front desk, I signed myself in, I got the
35:08
visitor badge, and then I started to walk to the room where my student was.
35:12
And it was clear that people were alarmed.
35:17
They weren’t use to having anyone brown in the building.
35:20
And it could’ve just been surprise, but it was very, very uncomfortable.
35:25
So I remember asking later my colleagues, “Could I please have all my supervisees
35:33
in one or two buildings?” So I could get a relationship going with the school
35:37
and not have to do this gauntlet of “yes, I’m from the university and yes,
35:43
I’m safe.” I mean, it was just hard work that I didn’t think was necessary.
35:49
I think that was one of those teeny tiny things where people were saying, “Well
35:52
why are we doing something special for Jean.” Not realizing, that they don’t get,
35:57
they’ll never get what it’s like to walk into a school in Corvallis when there’s no
36:03
one else brown in the school. I get that
36:09
and others often didn’t.
36:13
As I taught my classes at OSU, especially Multicultural Issues, I found myself
36:20
moving more and more into racial identity development, because the
36:25
earlier I put it in class, the easier it was for students to hang in there.
36:31
And let me tell you a bit more about that particular thing.
36:35
My daughter Mary was home for the summer of 1997 from her time at
36:39
Cornell where she was working on her Masters in Africana studies.
36:43
While she was there, before she came here, I attended the course she was a
36:48
graduate assistant in, one by William Cross, Jr., who is the originator
36:55
of Nigrescence and a very important man in Racial Identity Development.
37:00
I met Bill then and he has touched my life several times and I actually
37:03
interview him in my textbook.
37:07
So I asked her to teach my class about his racial identity theory.
37:10
And it’s probably listening to my daughter teach about it
37:13
was when I personally got it.
37:17
Now the original theory has several long terms like “pseudo-independent” and
37:25
autonomy and some complex definitions. But, over time, I came up with what I call
37:33
a simplistic “racial interaction theory.”
37:46
I’m going to start by quoting Robert Sternberg.
37:49
He said, “Being creative involves a willingness to step outside the
37:54
boxes that we and others have created for ourselves.” And as I’ve taught
38:02
Multicultural Issues in Education and I’ve realized its a process course, my
38:08
students need to understand this process, so they’ll hang in there. So I call Stage
38:16
One “I’m okay, you’re okay.” And this corresponds to the pre-encounter stage
38:21
in racial identity development theories. The second stage I call, “Something
38:26
is not okay.” This corresponds to the encounter stage found in most theories.
38:32
The third, I call, “I’m not so sure about you,” in this stage I summarize
38:38
several different stages from different theorists including Anger, Denial, like,
38:44
“I’m okay, you’re not Black enough” “I’m okay, you’re not”…things like
38:52
that….pseudo-independence/emersion.
39:03
Depending on the group I’m working with and their interests, I expanded
39:06
final stage using details from various identity development models.
39:10
And the last stage, I call “I’m okay, you’re okay, we’re okay.” This stage is
39:15
equivalent to the autonomy or independent stage where people are willing to work
39:20
for change in a more integrative manner. So when students understand that they’re
39:26
going to go through “a something is not okay phase,” pretty early in my
39:31
class, then they take a deep breath and hang in there a little longer. So
39:36
that’s why I had to move that little closer to the beginning of my class.
39:42
They would stay both literally and figuratively with me.
39:51
I want to go back just a little bit…I didn’t say anything about my
40:01
time at OSU as a student with my son.
40:05
I actually taught my son Matt in his first class at OSU.
40:11
I shared the class with a co- teacher, which was good, so
40:14
I didn’t have to grade him.
40:15
It was a real thrill to have my son there that year and I’m sure that having my
40:19
son on campus, a tall, fair, strong male.
40:26
There were several times that we hung around together and I think that
40:29
helped me see OSU as a safer place.
40:33
I wanted to bring that up because I think that’s key.
40:40
In this article called “Mom, Son, Graduate College Together” I
40:46
decided earlier that getting a doctorate was a very self-centered activity because
40:52
it focuses on research, writing, and dissertation and it doesn’t go well
40:56
with raising a family, which is why I waited until I did to go back. I’d
41:00
been asked years before but I waited.
41:03
What was really nice was that my husband was agreeable to my
41:06
plans, he did most of the cooking.
41:08
While I went to Corvallis a couple of times for a week, and it’s something that
41:12
I wanted to do for a long time, and I said at this point that I don’t think a
41:19
person’s ever too old to keep on learning.
41:24
And one month after entering the program, I celebrated my 50th birthday
41:29
by jumping out of an airplane.
41:32
They were both in the same ball park: lifelong dreams that you don’t know what
41:36
you’re getting into until you get into it.
41:38
I actually wrote an article called, “How is jumping out of an
41:41
airplane like doing a PhD program?”
41:52
[laughs]
41:52
My…little bit more of history…when I finished my doctorate, and people in
41:58
my committee said “congratulations, Dr. Moule” it was so amazing because Dr. Moule
42:04
to me is my husband’s father and after he died, his wife gave us his doctoral robe,
42:12
which I wore at my own graduation and I’m going to attend the commencement this
42:19
year, and it’ll be my last commencement I hope….Michelle Obama is going to be
42:27
the speaker….and then I’m shipping the robe to my daughter who will then use
42:31
it as she presides as the chair of the board of trustees for Voorhees College in
42:39
South Carolina, where my father attended.
42:43
And,
42:46
again,
42:50
a little bit more
42:53
[laughs] . After my children went off to college, I was sorta semi- retired.
42:57
I was writing stories, raising llamas, just kind of enjoying myself.
43:00
Then a phone call from a friend suggested that I go back and get my doctorate.
43:04
I just kind of humored her saying that I thought it was a good idea
43:07
while not seriously considering it.
43:09
It’s almost a fluke, I hadn’t planned on doing this, but once
43:12
I started, I worked as a graduate assistant, which paid for my courses.
43:18
As Mark Twain so aptly put it, “I’m glad that I did it, partly because it
43:22
was worth it, but mostly because I will never have to do it again.” That’s what
43:27
I wrote in my dissertation as well.
43:31
As I said, I stayed in Corvallis, starting as a graduate student,
43:34
for about three nights a week.
43:40
As I was getting ready for this interview, I ran across a piece, a
43:46
set of emails that I wrote back and forth with my first major professor and
43:53
it showed what my schedule was like.
43:57
This was actually in the year 2000.
44:01
I said, “My basic schedule is three contiguous days on campus of face-to-face
44:05
classes, advising, planning, meetings, etc. One and half days for email,
44:10
calls, and web course from home. Half a day for writing, until week five when
44:15
I do a concentrate week in prep for AERA.” I always liked to go to AERA
44:20
because there are folks of color there.
44:22
I went to AERA, the American Educational Research Association conference
44:27
almost my entire time at OSU.
44:30
In fact, I just got back this, two weeks ago from going to the one
44:35
in Vancouver, British Columbia.
44:37
But this one sentence, I read this and I reread it, “I’m under a great deal
44:42
of pressure right now, so just take the lead,” this is in a shared course,
44:47
“I’ll help and get more involved as I get my other three classes off the
44:52
ground.” So I had a very, very busy load.
44:58
And by commuting to Corvallis and staying in Corvallis, it saved me a two hour
45:04
commute every day that I stayed over, but,
45:11
it’s helped me to forge me a few friends and I attended a few evening events, but
45:16
in general because of that, not living in Corvallis, I never felt as actively
45:21
involved as a student or faculty member.
45:23
So, I do think that the distance played a key, but I believe race was a
45:30
bigger key [to my sense of isolation]
45:34
. And there’s a story here that I’d like to have collaborated
45:38
or refuted, so you can listen.
45:41
In 1996, while a doctoral student, I applied for and received a graduate
45:47
student stipend to attend AERA in Chicago.
45:51
After I did, then the director gave me a bit of support money as well.
45:56
I was invited to share a room with a professor, too.
46:01
While there I attended a film called “Shattering the Silences: Minority
46:05
Faculty Break into the Ivory Tower.” When I returned to campus I was determined
46:10
to share this film with black faculty and professional faculty on campus.
46:15
I arranged for the room and the film and got a list of the black folk on campus.
46:20
We viewed the film in December 1996.
46:24
Unbeknownst to me, following and because of the catalyst of the
46:27
film, the faculty began to meet on a regular basis beginning in January.
46:32
As far as I know, this was the beginning of AFAPC.
46:37
Also, as far as I know, no one connects my showing of the film
46:41
to the subsequent meetings!
46:43
I did work with a small committee that included Angelo Gomez and we cut the
46:47
film down from 90 minutes to 45 minutes.
46:51
Tim White’s college was the only one to fully embrace this film and show it
46:55
to everyone possible, even closing some offices to allow for a joint viewing.
47:01
I was part of the small group debriefs that happened after this film.
47:06
And, years later, in our own college our faculty viewed this or one of two
47:11
other films as the yearly opening event.
47:16
I’d like to… there are several threads going through this interview and I
47:21
know I keep bouncing around a bit.
47:23
But there’s one little piece from my
47:29
journey that I’d like to share.
47:34
This is when I was doing the library paper for my dissertation.
47:40
In one point, in the video tape of my presentation, I stand with my hands
47:45
on the table in front of me, with my head hanging down, documenting my
47:50
frustration with trying to answer the third challenge from this faculty member.
47:56
I felt that she was questioning not only my analysis, but my very being.
48:01
Strangers viewing the tape marveled at that faculty members
48:04
are allowed to verbally accost doctoral students in such a manner.
48:09
Such questioning, if ever appropriate, is usually reserved for the closed part
48:15
of an oral exam or doctoral defense.
48:18
At a certain point, this probing seemed to pass the line into racism; let me explain.
48:25
This faculty member’s insistence on only a Euro-centric perspective may
48:30
have evidenced an institutional bias.
48:33
It’s been argued that whites consider an idea authoritative when it’s been
48:37
published, where folks of color, particularly blacks, consider it
48:42
important for individuals to have personal positions on issues and to assume full
48:47
responsibility for arguing as such.
48:51
I was determined to include my personal position and include my current
48:55
life context, but the faculty member wanted only hard objective facts.
49:01
There are some researchers that assert that claiming objectivity is itself the
49:10
bias stance of privileged, white males.
49:13
In her zeal to discredit my inclusion of additional criteria of
49:17
my work…for instance, I decided it was important to include the race
49:21
of the researcher in the studies,
49:24
so I would include that when reviewing and analyzing.
49:27
She was blind to the strength of my objective analysis and she missed
49:31
my efforts to bridge paradigms.
49:34
Other participants found my standard analysis to be clear and complete.
49:39
And I think this is a really clear example of how the work of a black
49:45
faculty member, having to do both the standards being held by the institution
49:50
that she’s in and a standard that she can personally live with, makes the job a
49:58
lot more difficult - excuse me I’m going to be a little bit out of the order.
50:06
All right.
50:07
We are a little bit more, my son Matt and I completed…He completed
50:12
his masters degree the same day that I completed my PhD and the picture
50:19
of our celebration is quite amazing.
50:24
We have… in that picture…We have my family, we have my son Matt
50:35
graduating, myself graduating.
50:39
We have my husband, showing his wallet open [empty!] , because in the picture
50:44
we also have my son Michael and his wife, who have just been married, and
50:52
they’re kissing each other [laughs] and then we have my daughter Mary and her
50:56
fiancée, who are about to get married.
50:59
And this whole event is on June 14, which is our wedding anniversary,
51:05
and it’s also Fathers Day.
51:07
So, that all happened in one day.
51:11
What a kick!
51:11
That was June 14, 1998.
51:15
Okay, so let’s focus a little bit on the Immersion Program.
51:24
The Master of Arts … the program that you initiated, correct?
51:28
Teaching 21st Century Education?
51:31
Yeah [pause, papers rustling] I’m
51:50
going to start talking about what it was like to get this grant out of the blue.
51:56
It all started because I was just sitting alone at my desk and this RFP
52:01
came over my desk and I applied for it.
52:05
And then I got it.
52:08
RFP, did you say?
52:08
Yes, that’s the word for when you put in for a proposal to get funding.
52:15
So, I managed it, and the first thing I had to do
52:25
was, an Eisenhower professional development grant, the very first thing I
52:28
had to do was to find a school to do this.
52:34
What happened was the Immersion Program placed in Portland and Salem was based on
52:44
this Eisenhower grant that provided the MAT Program before the immersion program
52:54
with money to take all the students in the MAT Program that was based in
53:00
Corvallis to Portland for three weeks.
53:07
And they were living in a dorm; we had the money to support
53:10
them in a dorm and to feed them.
53:12
And, in the end, I ended up giving classes for the people in the schools, so it
53:19
was just an amazing, amazing, a real highlight of my time at OSU, to be able
53:25
to take our students to a diverse setting.
53:28
‘Cause my feeling was the distance of Oregon State from these areas
53:33
of rich cultural diversity makes it difficult for pre- service students
53:37
to work with more than a few isolated students of color in local schools.
53:42
And many of those students in Corvallis are assimilated into the communities.
53:47
So, how was I going to find a school?
53:52
I called the first school.
53:54
I started by looking in a database of schools in Oregon that included
53:58
an ethnic makeup and highlighted every school in Portland with a
54:02
minority population of 80% or more.
54:05
I also found a database that had the race of the teachers.
54:08
I felt it would be best if they were in a place where they had mentors of color.
54:13
So the first school I called, they said “no.”
54:19
We’re being reconstituted, we don’t think it’s a good year to have guests.
54:23
A bit disappointed and not willing to face another “no” response over the
54:27
telephone, I decided to find placements through direct new personal contacts.
54:33
I showed up at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary school cold.
54:38
“Is the principal in?” I asked. “No,” replied the secretary Claudia.
54:43
“Would you like to speak to the Vice-Principal?” “Oh yes.” I waited.
54:48
To my surprise and disbelief, I know this woman.
54:50
She and I had worked together on the Talented and Gifted circuit years before.
54:54
Her name, Joy, expresses my emotions.
54:57
I pleaded, I explained, I became excited.
55:00
The principal returned and Joy introduced me.
55:04
Joseph Malone is the best principal I have ever worked with.
55:07
One intern described him this way: “The principal of King plays a very active
55:13
role in the culture of the school.
55:14
He has a very dynamic personality.
55:17
I have noticed that he often interacts with students more than
55:20
I have seen other principals.
55:22
He makes a concerted effort to connect with the students.
55:26
I’ve observed him on the playground, in the halls, and at lunchtimes.
55:29
He works the lunch line due to underfunding.
55:32
He has the respect of teachers, who I have heard acknowledge his flexibility
55:35
and contribution to the school.
55:38
I feel the principal of King is a great gift to the school, the students, and
55:42
the teachers.” I remember watching him serving lunch and calling the children
55:46
“doctor” as he serves them. And the difficulty of finding him at his office?
55:51
He’s always with children in classrooms.
55:54
One time a policeman stopped by the school at three AM because there
55:57
was a light on and he was working.
56:01
This man is amazing and he trusted me.
56:09
I remember also I watched the day the governor visited his school with an
56:16
entourage and a pack of legislators.
56:18
Many saw Malone as the chief guide of the visitors.
56:23
I was one of the few who saw him an hour earlier in rubber gloves, checking each
56:27
restroom for cleanliness in the building.
56:30
It’s just a wonderful, old polished stately building
56:33
and I’d work there for years.
56:37
At our first meeting, Malone said that the mentors would have to be volunteers.
56:42
There was a staff meeting that day.
56:44
I walk into the school and he tells me that I can go the
56:47
staff meeting that afternoon.
56:50
I have nothing with me.
56:52
No preparation.
56:54
I held my breath and I asked to be allowed to share my vision with the
56:58
teachers that day, and he agreed.
57:10
At the meeting, I had only my ideas and my enthusiasm, but I found an ally.
57:16
Lolita Darby, her gray hair framing her face, her warm voice
57:21
promising both strength and care, sat on the edge of the crowd.
57:25
It’s a crowd to me, for the school had 800 students and 35 staff members, miles
57:31
and hues in skin color from Corvallis.
57:35
I am energized.
57:36
I drink in the diversity, the myriad colors.
57:39
I feel as if I have returned to the school of my childhood.
57:45
Lolita, bless her soul because she’s gone now, catches the vision.
57:49
She sees it, feels it and reflects it.
57:51
She volunteers on the spot.
57:54
I’d envisioned older teachers, particularly teachers of color,
57:58
passing the torch to a new generation.
58:00
Eventually, I write an article on the importance of African American mentor
58:05
teachers that is published in the Journal of Negro Education and that
58:11
came out of research in this setting.
58:14
But Lolita buys this vision, no, she invents it, for I had
58:18
little idea what it could be.
58:20
Eleven days later, Lolita and another teacher, Gloria, drive all the way down
58:25
to Corvallis to help with the workshop to get our students ready to go up there.
58:30
And by the end of that day, Lolita has chosen her two mentees for when
58:35
we’re going to go up to campus.
58:41
There’s so much more here.
58:43
I don’t want to read too much,
58:49
but I think it’s important for us to understand this Immersion Program
58:56
with the students changes, even a half day, a day, changes how people feel.
59:05
Even incoming, pre-service teachers feel about working with a diversity population.
59:15
Jen said, “I hope to gain satisfaction of connecting with the child.”
59:23
In the first week, she reports feeling overwhelmed, scared, and apprehensive.
59:29
During her first week onsite, she meets one-on-one with an OSU faculty
59:34
member whose specialty is mathematics.
59:38
Lolita
59:44
calms her, suggesting she works for the kids and with them.
59:49
:00] Miss Jennifer adds, because Lolita calls all of the student
59:55
teachers “Miss” or “Mrs.” or “Mr.”
1:00:04
she becomes more comfortable with the mathematic subject matter.
1:00:07
She also bonds with the students and becomes immersed in the classroom
1:00:10
culture: “Each day, I’m getting more attached to the kids I mentor. They
1:00:14
are so willing to share so many things about their personal lives. They’re so
1:00:17
inviting and compassionate about people.
1:00:20
I feel that the culture is family oriented and they really watch out for each other.
1:00:25
The language and lingo is great to hear.
1:00:27
Sometimes it confuses me, but one way that I know that I’m included
1:00:31
is when they share with me what certain terms and phrases mean.
1:00:35
It’s one way that they invite me in.”
1:00:45
Jen talks about how Lolita knows so many of the parents, grandparents,
1:00:49
and extended family of the students.
1:00:51
In many cases, she’s had the parents as students, now she
1:00:56
has their children as students.
1:01:00
She also notices that the African American students
1:01:06
will talk about their affiliation not only with friends and family, but also knowing
1:01:10
the Lord, they talk about their religion, or not their religion, their faith.
1:01:17
“There’s not a fear stigma of acceptance on talking about the
1:01:22
Lord in my class, it’s a subject of great value and great identity.
1:01:25
I’ve also noticed the strong affiliation with the fashion scene.” And Jennifer
1:01:31
talks about how Lolita walks the talk.
1:01:34
And she, at the end, talks about a student that she relates to on a one to one basis.
1:01:46
She sees this young student say to her, “I’m going to miss you, Miss Jen.
1:01:52
Can we keep in touch?” And, as they’re walking out of
1:01:57
the car, a younger girl says
1:02:00
“Hi Niesha,”
1:02:03
“I don’t even know that little girl” [answers the 5th grader] Jen says,
1:02:12
“That’s when I explained to her that she’s a fifth grader, and younger
1:02:15
kids look up to her at all times.
1:02:17
She needs to be a good example for them.” She said, ‘Do you think she
1:02:21
looks up to me like I look up to you, Miss Jen?’ This was one of those
1:02:28
moments when I felt needed and it just reinforced my desire to be a teacher.”
1:02:34
So this is where she connected to one student.
1:02:38
And one last thing, as she came back to Corvallis, “I miss the diversity, energy,
1:02:46
spirit, and overall feeling of MLK.
1:02:49
My mom felt it right away when she walked into the door on Friday and
1:02:52
said, ‘I can understand why you don’t want to leave.’ She said she did not
1:02:57
know what she was expecting, but it was nothing like what she experienced.
1:03:01
I had been trying to explain to her for three weeks.
1:03:05
She said that it was one of the neatest places that she had ever visited.
1:03:08
I was so glad that she was able to come.
1:03:11
Unless you’ve been there, it’s hard to describe to an outsider.” That’s just
1:03:16
a little bit about the strength of the Immersion Program both the short
1:03:22
three weeks, and the year-long one that I eventually put together about
1:03:27
why it is so important to do that.
1:03:33
Has that program continued?
1:03:34
Is it still in existence?
1:03:37
It lasted for one year after I left.
1:03:51
It grew out of some of what was going on at OSU.
1:03:56
A lot of it was the things that were happening to me and the MAT
1:04:01
program before the Immersion Program.
1:04:04
I remember this one particular incidence.
1:04:07
We were reviewing applications and, as we were reviewing applications, I
1:04:11
had in my hand, the student we were interviewing, and I realized that we
1:04:17
had rejected the file of an African American who had applied for the
1:04:23
program for exactly the same thing that was wrong with this student’s file.
1:04:32
But this student was in for an interview and the other one had been rejected.
1:04:39
And I do not anger easily and people have never seen me angry.
1:04:47
I get frustrated and I raise my voice, “Oh Please!” I plead
1:04:53
with people, my voice raises.
1:04:56
But when I get angry, I leave.
1:05:00
And in that instant, I was in the middle of the interview, I
1:05:04
recognized what had happened.
1:05:05
I mean, because I’m alone out here.
1:05:09
And having some black students in the program is going to help me
1:05:13
as well as everyone else in the program to have some diversity.
1:05:18
I got up in the interview and I walked out.
1:05:22
And I slumped against the wall.
1:05:26
It’s one of about two or three times in my life that I actually saw red.
1:05:31
It’s been said that you “see red” when you get angry.
1:05:34
I saw red.
1:05:36
I was so angry.
1:05:41
I can’t tell you how angry I was.
1:05:47
It was a clear case, just as clear as a bell, and
1:05:59
I then
1:06:04
moved to redo the application process so it was fairer and it was consistent.
1:06:11
That was part of the reason for that.
1:06:14
And I served the MAT program before the Immersion Program started.
1:06:18
And I think that was part of why I felt the need to get
1:06:24
the Immersion Program going.
1:06:26
Because you have to live in these settings to really get some of this.
1:06:31
The difference in black and white communication styles is very real in
1:06:37
the terms of a little more exuberance and a little higher voice and if you
1:06:44
don’t get that that’s a communication style and you hear it, you think it’s
1:06:50
because someone’s angry, and it’s not.
1:06:52
And unless one has more experiences like that, they don’t get it.
1:06:56
So that was one of the, I don’t know if you call it institutional
1:07:00
or faculty biases that I was coming up against all the time.
1:07:13
I came to dislike
1:07:19
my one-time-mentor because of her unchanging perspective and always “being
1:07:25
right” including feeling that as a white Hispanic, she knew racism, which
1:07:29
of course, in many ways, she did not.
1:07:33
Her disrespect for me was incredible at points.
1:07:37
I stopped going into her office because I realized I would leave with stuff to do
1:07:41
with her or stuff she thought I should do.
1:07:45
It was a case of once a student, always a student for her, for me, going
1:07:49
from student to faculty, perhaps.
1:07:53
I do believe she is a very large part of why I did not successfully get
1:07:57
promotion when I went up for tenure.
1:08:00
She is a very good example of “the well-intentioned still being racist.”
1:08:06
She epitomizes for me one of the most racist statements someone can
1:08:11
make, it was that she said to me that “something has nothing to do with race.”
1:08:19
This is a prime example of a white person stating that a black person’s experience
1:08:26
is not valid unless they see it and
1:08:34
they validate it.
1:08:35
In other words, as a black person, unless you see my experience and agree
1:08:41
that I’ve experienced this and see it,
1:08:45
then it doesn’t exist.
1:08:47
And, at one level, that is the most racist thing that someone
1:08:51
can say is “Has nothing to do with race.” Because how would they know?
1:08:58
There are some things that may not, that objectively are not, you know.
1:09:04
And one of the things, honestly, there were several times when I was at OSU
1:09:09
that I would just get home so exhausted.
1:09:12
I would have to wait in the car outside and just take a deep breath.
1:09:16
And sometime I would have to decompress my first morning back, just to deal
1:09:20
with all the things that were going on.
1:09:24
And there were a couple times when I would just shake my head and I was beginning to
1:09:28
feel so beat down and so marginalized that I had to remember that I scored really,
1:09:37
really high on objective tests and that I’m really very bright and intelligent.
1:09:43
And I think that’s amazing that I would have to get to that point
1:09:46
because of some of the disrespect.
1:09:49
The same person that I’m talking about, often expressed somehow
1:09:53
[regarding] the car trip from Corvallis to Portland for placement.
1:09:57
And that this was more dangerous than the car trip from
1:10:03
Portland to Corvallis and back.
1:10:06
I kid you not.
1:10:08
I remember a day when we had finally gathered to discuss some important
1:10:12
details of giving our students experiences in Portland and she spent most of our
1:10:16
valuable time talking about how we should not have them travel that dangerous route.
1:10:21
She even said, in a meeting, that if there was an accident,
1:10:25
that I would be responsible.
1:10:28
Yet she would freely ask for both my and others [usually minorities,
1:10:33
if based in Portland] to make extra trips to OSU, over these dangerous
1:10:37
roads, to serve some purpose she saw.
1:10:40
But again, it is just
1:10:43
really hard to reveal that or to show that to someone.
1:10:49
I was quite surprised when our elementary unit saw my efforts to have our
1:10:53
students experience diversity in actual settings as somehow serving myself.
1:10:58
Well, yes, I am Black and there are more people of color in Portland.
1:11:03
But as I said before, I knew no one in Portland, I didn’t know Portland.
1:11:08
I went there because there were students of color there.
1:11:12
We found a school in Salem that was a dual language immersion program.
1:11:20
And later, for the MAT program, we had half our students there
1:11:25
and half our students in Portland for the three week placement that
1:11:29
predated the Immersion Program.
1:11:31
We had all of our students for three weeks in Portland, so there’s a
1:11:34
little bit of a difference there.
1:11:38
Yet, we said we wanted to do this, to give people diversity.
1:11:42
Often at OSU I saw quite a bit of rhetoric about diversity, yet walls and
1:11:46
obstacles about anything that moved us in that direction that took extra work.
1:11:51
I often felt that I was the only one ready to put my time, passion, and, more
1:11:55
importantly, my research and writing on the line to reach our stated goals.
1:12:02
One of the simple ones was, you know, I said, we have the applications
1:12:06
and then we have some interviews.
1:12:08
Why should we have our students come to OSU?
1:12:11
Why don’t we hold the interviews for the program in Portland and in Salem?
1:12:17
So we just drive and we interview everyone there that lives there.
1:12:22
And I remember no one wanted to do it.
1:12:25
It’s like “oh break with tradition; too much work!” But, I’m going,
1:12:29
well if you mean it, that you want to recruit a diverse population.
1:12:33
Why wouldn’t you go and interview in a place that’s more familiar, and easier,
1:12:40
and connected for those students?
1:12:42
Why make them come here?
1:12:45
And eventually, in the Immersion Program, when I had more control
1:12:50
of that, that’s what we did.
1:12:51
We held the interviews and not only that, we had them work in the school
1:12:56
for the whole day and interviewed them while they’re in school.
1:13:02
So they knew the schools that they’d probably be in.
1:13:06
And there were some students, after they were in the school for the day, and had
1:13:11
the interview, withdraw their application because they decided that this isn’t
1:13:14
what I wanted to do, and that was fine.
1:13:16
But the reality of it was there.
1:13:20
At the same time, there are people in the schools who see…and I’ll
1:13:27
read you one student reflection on that…as one of the most
1:13:35
important experiences of their lives and it was really amazing what happened.
1:13:45
I’d like to quote from this,
1:13:51
Martin Luther King’s Letter from Birmingham Jail.
1:13:56
This was in an article I wrote called “Social Justice: High Road to
1:14:03
Action? Or Low Road to Salving Your Conscience?” which is what I felt
1:14:10
a lot of faculty at OSU were doing; fine with it until it takes work.
1:14:20
Martin said: I must confess that I am not afraid of the word "tension."
1:14:24
I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of
1:14:28
constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth…
1:14:36
We need to create the kind of tension in society that will help people to
1:14:41
rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights
1:14:45
of understanding and brotherhood.
1:14:47
I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.
1:14:51
First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely
1:14:56
disappointed with the white moderate.
1:14:59
As a parenthesis here, I would call that my liberal white colleagues.
1:15:04
He says, King says: I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that
1:15:10
the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the
1:15:14
White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is
1:15:20
more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is
1:15:25
the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice;
1:15:30
who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree
1:15:35
with your methods of direct action."…
1:15:42
Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute
1:15:49
misunderstanding from people of ill will.
1:15:53
Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.
1:16:01
Now, I do believe that several faculty members at OSU finally
1:16:05
got it, but at what a cost for me.
1:16:10
There’s a scene from Lee Mun Wah’s movie Last Chance for Eden and it’s the first
1:16:16
time I saw it illustrate in a way that I went, “Ah, now I get it!” So, this Native
1:16:23
American is talking about how a group of girls that she knew played basketball
1:16:32
with another group of girls and they won.
1:16:35
And the coach of the losing team said that the girls had to be taken
1:16:44
into the bathroom to prove that they were girls, because they won.
1:16:51
And the woman, Native American who’s sharing this, you can see that she’s
1:16:56
starting to get a little trembly and nervous and Lee Mun Wah stops,
1:17:04
appreciates that story, and then he says, “ I want you to tell me how you
1:17:09
feel.” And then she really starts to cry.
1:17:13
And then she says, “I share that story. I go through that pain again.” And Lee
1:17:21
Mun Wah sees that pain and starts again.
1:17:25
She starts to cry and she says, “I go through that story just so some white
1:17:29
person can get it just a little.”
1:17:32
And
1:17:35
that’s how I feel a lot about my time at OSU.
1:17:39
That there’d be these times when I share my heart and soul, I do my
1:17:46
writing, or I get in a meeting and I bring this to the table and my chair,
1:17:52
and I get nods all around the table.
1:17:55
And then I was left in an emotional mess sometime.
1:18:03
But after ten or twelve years, some people got it [laughs]
1:18:07
. But at what a cost to me.
1:18:14
I guess I would like to tell a little more about the work of the program.
1:18:20
The amount of work it took.
1:18:22
And then I would like to talk a little more about my teaching.
1:18:26

Follow up with students on strengths and weaknesses of the program
1:21:57
In our unit, you got no FTE for running a program, program lead.
1:22:06
It was considered….You still taught your two classes, you still had your
1:22:13
research and scholarship, you still had service, and then you had this.
1:22:19
So, I guess you can see why I needed to retire.
1:22:25
I think I was just plain overworked.
1:22:28
It was pretty amazing.
1:22:30
Okay, I’d like to go back to my teaching a little bit, okay?
1:22:41
One of the stories I often tell on the first day of my classes
1:22:48
is
1:22:53
how I want to relate to students,
1:22:58
how I want them to have a safe place,
1:23:03
and I tell them
1:23:09
a story.
1:23:14
One of the assignments, so that I can get to know the students very well, is
1:23:21
an intake form and their journal entries.
1:23:24
So they probably have three or four per class, over the quarter.
1:23:30
And, both on the intake form and the journal entries, I tell them that, unless
1:23:36
they tell me not to, I may read excerpts from it to the class [always anonymously]
1:23:42
. Well, this one time, I read a journal entry from a student
1:23:49
who was an incredible writer.
1:23:52
And
1:23:56
I guess I should describe her as being raised on a ranch in central Oregon.
1:24:05
She wore cowboy boots and a belt buckle and sometimes
1:24:09
she wore a hat, I don’t know.
1:24:11
But you could tell that she was a ranch gal. And there was
1:24:14
another guy in the class who dressed similarly and they bonded.
1:24:20
So, they often sat together in the back of the room.
1:24:25
But she’s an exceptional writer, and one day, I’m standing in front of the
1:24:28
class, and I read her journal entries, about what happened when she married
1:24:33
an African American man, and how when her boss found out that she was married
1:24:40
to an African American, she was fired.
1:24:41
They
1:24:45
were living together…I guess she had an apartment and they married
1:24:49
and they lived in the apartment she had and her landlord threw them out.
1:24:56
They walked down the streets of San Francisco and a bunch of guys started
1:25:01
beating up her husband and hitting on her…it was very… and she wrote very
1:25:07
well, just incredibly moving stories.
1:25:10
So I’m sitting up in the front of the room, and I’m reading these journal
1:25:16
entries, anonymously to the whole class.
1:25:20
In the back of the room,
1:25:24
she’s sitting, next to this guy, he doesn’t know who it is, he leans over
1:25:31
to her and says to her, “That’s what she gets for marrying a black man.”
1:25:39
And she starts to cry, and she gets up and walks to the front of the room,
1:25:48
and she says, “That was my story.” And
1:25:57
that was the best case I’ve ever seen of a wakeup call for that student, who happened
1:26:04
to live, by the way, a few miles from where we’re sitting…I actually knew him.
1:26:08
He went [prior to] undergraduate years to a place where I had taught.
1:26:13
So I knew this student.
1:26:15
And he spent the rest of the quarter trying to apologize
1:26:18
to me, apologize to her.
1:26:20
But it was that racial identity development.
1:26:23
Something is not okay.
1:26:24
Suddenly his racism is revealed.
1:26:28
And here’s another one that I like to share:
1:26:33
“Since the beginning of this class, a situation I encountered recently has
1:26:37
continually been popping into my mind.
1:26:40
I figure that this situation has been surfacing for a reason.
1:26:44
So, I decided that this class presents a good opportunity for me to discuss it.
1:26:49
Throughout the past two years, I have baby sat for a young girl on a regular basis.
1:26:54
Throughout this time, we have shared a lot of quality time together.
1:26:56
I feel that I have played a fairly significant role in
1:26:59
her first three years of life.
1:27:01
About six months ago, I was watching her on a beautiful sunny day.
1:27:05
I asked her if she would like to go outside and play.
1:27:07
She looked at me very seriously and replied, ‘No.’ I thought that
1:27:11
this was unusual so I asked her why she didn’t want to play outside.
1:27:15
She responded by saying, ‘I don’t want to play out there when it’s sunny because
1:27:20
I’m afraid my skin will turn dark like yours.’ She continued on and explained to
1:27:25
me that she wants to keep her light, white skin and she’s afraid if she goes outside
1:27:29
on a sunny day, she will become dark.
1:27:31
She says she does not think that dark skin is pretty like her white skin.
1:27:36
I have to say that I was pretty taken back by the fact that this
1:27:39
child was only three years old.
1:27:41
And she was expressing this concern to me.
1:27:43
I know her parents very well and they both value diversity and show
1:27:47
respect for individual differences.
1:27:49
I was struggling to decipher just what this child’s words meant
1:27:53
and how I should respond to her.
1:27:55
I could not believe that at such a young age, this child had somehow developed
1:28:02
the notion that a dark skin tone was not as pretty as a light skin tone.
1:28:07
I bring this situation up, mainly, because I want to talk about how
1:28:11
I felt when she talked like this.
1:28:15
I’ve a very olive tone complexioned,” this student is white, by the way, “and
1:28:19
in the summer, my skin gets fairly dark.
1:28:22
I have noticed that I began to become very defensive when she talked in this way.
1:28:30
In a sense, I became offended.
1:28:32
She continued to state her concern about going outside in the summer sun because
1:28:35
she did not want to get dark like myself.
1:28:38
I decided that I should talk to her about how everyone has different skin tones and
1:28:42
that no one color is better than the next.
1:28:45
I explained to her that even her skin tone was slightly different
1:28:49
than her mother’s and brothers.
1:28:51
I told her that I thought that my skin tone as well as hers
1:28:54
was beautiful in many ways.
1:28:56
I would like to hear your response to this particular situation, specifically, I
1:29:01
want to know if you feel this young child was actually forming these biases that a
1:29:05
parent should be concerned about, or if you think this was just common curiosity.
1:29:10
I would also like to know how you would respond to a young
1:29:12
girl’s comments such as these.
1:29:15
Also, I would like to start to discover why I felt hurt and defensive
1:29:22
when she was talking about my skin color in the manner she did.
1:29:26
What do you think about all this?”
1:29:27
[my written response to student] “First, studies have shown that children in
1:29:33
the U.S.A develop the value of sense of skin color by about age 3 or 4
1:29:38
regardless of parental effort or color.
1:29:41
Our cultural racism is just that deep and unconscious.
1:29:44
Isn’t that just incredibly sad?” And I have to add the story at this point
1:29:50
that’s not related to my response.
1:29:52
But I’d like to add this story about a little white child in
1:29:57
an upper class neighborhood with her mother in a grocery store.
1:30:03
And, as she’s walking around the grocery store, she sees
1:30:07
a little Latina individual.
1:30:09
She goes up to her mother, at age four, she pulls on her
1:30:12
mother’s skirt and she says to her mother, “Look Mom, a baby maid.”
1:30:20
So, yeah, that’s our subtle racism.
1:30:23
Back to what I told my student in class.
1:30:25
“Second, I think that you gave an admirable answer. You might to carefully
1:30:31
select a few children’s books with protagonists of color to give to her.
1:30:36
As to your own defensiveness, I figure how my father must’ve felt when I, age five,
1:30:41
wished I had blond hair and blue eyes.
1:30:43
Our hope our sessions on Racial Identity Development will help you
1:30:47
make meaning of your feelings.”
1:30:55
Okay…One other thing I often do in class, besides having people
1:30:59
journal and respond to them.
1:31:01
On the first day, I like to show an eleven minute film, “The Lunch
1:31:07
Date,” and I discuss their answers the second day. And they write
1:31:12
their responses to it anonymously, so when I read them anonymously the
1:31:19
next week, I don’t know who they are, but they know if they wrote it.
1:31:23
And what happens is that film, because of the students’ responses, reveals
1:31:30
the racism of the undergraduates in my room very quickly.
1:31:37
And it makes them pay very close attention, especially
1:31:42
the ones who are caught in it.
1:31:44
They can’t believe they were caught so easily.
1:31:47
Would you tell us a little about it?
1:31:48
The film?
1:31:48
Sure.
1:31:49
It’s an eleven minute film and you have a woman in Grand Central
1:31:53
Station in New York City.
1:31:55
She’s running to get her train.
1:31:58
She runs into a black man with a briefcase.
1:32:02
He tries to help her, pick up her stuff in her purse.
1:32:05
She misses her train, she goes to get a salad.
1:32:08
She gets the salad, sits down, goes back to
1:32:13
get the fork and when she comes back, supposedly, there’s a
1:32:17
black man eating her salad.
1:32:20
Now…he says, “Get out of here,” which you can hardly hear.
1:32:28
And she says, “You’re eating my salad!” And finally, he’s eating,
1:32:32
she starts eating the salad with him.
1:32:37
At one point, the music changes, and he gets her a cup
1:32:40
of coffee and brings it back.
1:32:43
And that’s why it’s called a lunch date.
1:32:45
And then she looks at her watch, she’s missing her time,
1:32:47
and she runs to her train.
1:32:50
And she realizes that she left her bag at a booth.
1:32:52
And she comes back to the booth, and you see her walking back and forth
1:32:56
because her bag’s gone, and it’s at
1:32:59
that moment that she realizes that her salad and bag were at
1:33:04
a table beyond the booth of the man whose salad she ate, okay.
1:33:10
She ate the wrong salad.
1:33:13
She laughs.
1:33:14
Maybe she gets it.
1:33:15
And there’s lots of other details.
1:33:17
And the problem with this film is that I’ll have students, after they’ve
1:33:23
seen it, say right to me, “I’m really mad at that film maker, where all the
1:33:31
bums were black and all the blacks were bums.” They’ll tell me something
1:33:36
like that. Yet, in the film, there’s a black man with a brief case,
1:33:43
there’s a man who bought his own salad and buys her coffee. And yet, their eyes
1:33:49
are so focused on a stereotype of black, that they see it when it’s not there.
1:33:56
And so that film really opens up a lot of eyes…it’s on YouTube.
1:34:02
You just YouTube “The Lunch Date” and you can see it.
1:34:05
Of course, now you know
1:34:09
the trick ending [laughs]
1:34:11
. Anyway, I love to use that one.
1:34:17
I keep a warm fuzzy file, in which I drop notes, emails, cards that warm
1:34:22
my soul, and I often get both good and positive evaluations on my evaluations.
1:34:30
One of the ones that I remember most was...I had told the students to get
1:34:35
together in groups that were different… that were differences in them…I
1:34:41
made a comment that one group looked
1:34:45
the same, but they were all white females with about the length blond
1:34:49
hair, and their eye color was the same, and I just made that comment.
1:34:54
I didn’t … it was just a neutral comment.
1:34:57
But I saw evaluations at the end of the year on that exact same moment.
1:35:06
And one student said, “I’m so glad that you made a point that on the surface
1:35:14
we looked the same, but we had some differences and diversity.” And the very
1:35:22
next sheet underneath it said, “I think you’re talking about how people are not,
1:35:31
how skin color is…” It a whole negative thing about the exact same thing and I
1:35:39
went “What?” Or I’ve even had some say,
1:35:44
“This class… This is horrible.
1:35:46
No one should ever take a class with Dr. Moule.” Then the very next
1:35:52
evaluation, same class, is like, “Oh, this is the best class I’ve ever
1:35:55
taken. Everyone in the university should have to take a class from her.”
1:36:02
So it just swings.
1:36:04
It’s this opposite thing.
1:36:06
But a couple more from the warm, fuzzy file.
1:36:10
“As the term comes to an end, I think back to how crazy it’s been for me.
1:36:15
I’ve really enjoyed my classes, but most of all, I’ve enjoyed this class.
1:36:20
I know there are many in this class that will disagree with me and think this
1:36:22
class may not be what they had expected.
1:36:24
Honestly, it is not what I expected either.
1:36:27
Dr. Moule may not know it, but she has made a pretty large impact on
1:36:31
my life and has made me open my mind and heart even more to other people.
1:36:38
I like this class because every Tuesday at 4 pm it seems as if it was more of
1:36:43
a chat session where we come and talk about some of the things that have been
1:36:48
on our minds and not just, here is a power point, memorize this, study this.
1:36:52
The learning environment was very comfortable for me.
1:36:55
I know if anyone reads this they might think that I am only saying
1:36:58
this stuff knowing that Jean will read this and hopefully give me a
1:37:01
good grade, but to those of you who think that, this is my Journal and
1:37:05
I can say really whatever I want in it, another nice part of this class.
1:37:10
I am taking this opportunity to thank you Jean for making a positive impact
1:37:14
on my life and although I am glad for you that you are retiring, many
1:37:18
future students are missing out on what you have given me.” That’s one.
1:37:29
“I have Jean Moule in Multicultural Issues and Education Class. Also, she’s served
1:37:34
as my mentor teacher in my classes and in graduate school and in the Immersion
1:37:37
Program based in the Portland area.
1:37:39
I honestly loved my time last year because of her dedication in making
1:37:43
this program the best it could be.
1:37:45
Jean is a very educated professional that taught us many things you cannot
1:37:48
read in a textbook or hear in a lecture.
1:37:51
She truly taught us how to live our lives and teach in a way that focuses on
1:37:56
social justice and not just tolerating other cultures, but grasping them, and
1:38:01
appreciating all cultures and ethnicities.
1:38:04
I believe I learned so much from her.
1:38:06
She was very kind, considerate, and compassionate person, that you knew
1:38:11
you could count on no matter what.
1:38:13
She was always an email or a call away, and you always felt that she would stop
1:38:18
whatever she was doing [she’s a VERY BUSY lady!] to respond in some way.
1:38:24
Jean was always dedicated and compassionate about teaching.
1:38:27
She gave us a unique perspective on a teaching program as she, being
1:38:31
African American, was able to share stories and give us strategies to
1:38:34
use in our own placements for the six of us student teachers placed
1:38:38
in the very diverse Northeast Portland, Humboldt and Kings school.
1:38:43
I think of her kindness and true energy in being professor.
1:38:46
She touched all of our lives, not just our minds.
1:38:49
I honestly don't think my teaching license program would be the same without her.
1:38:54
Thanks a lot.” So…
1:39:07
Well let's talk about your book, Cultural Competence: A Primer for Educators.
1:39:14
How that process came about, and, I'm interested in also finding out what your
1:39:19
thoughts were on the, at the time that you wrote the book, and when you were
1:39:24
writing and working on your classes, what was the content that was already
1:39:29
out there about multiculturalism in the classrooms, or if you felt there wasn't
1:39:33
that content, and therefore you needed to
1:39:38
write the book?
1:39:40
I think the books that were out there did not have the psychological component
1:39:45
that was needed for this journey.
1:39:47
That was my main thing.
1:39:48
Excellent books, materials there, some have some humor in them, some
1:39:52
have a lot of case studies and some stories that do make you think and
1:39:56
respond and connect, but I didn't see one that talked specifically
1:40:01
about how the journey itself would be psychologically difficult, and in this
1:40:09
book,
1:40:12
the way it came about is rather unusual.
1:40:14
I was having a very, very busy day on campus.
1:40:17
I had a student worker doing something in my office, and I had appointments,
1:40:21
and then this textbook salesperson comes in with someone else with her, and I
1:40:28
don't have time, I say "I'll talk with you for a couple minutes outside of the
1:40:31
office" because things were happening in my office, so I just sat outside.
1:40:33
I just really wanted to get rid of them, because, you know, I needed to do my work.
1:40:41
They leave.
1:40:42
I get a call from the guy who was with her turned out to be
1:40:49
an editor for Wadsworth Cengage,
1:40:55
and he had an author who'd written a book called Human Diversity: a Primer,
1:41:02
no, Cultural Diversity: A Primer for the Human Services, and now this editor and
1:41:08
the author wanted to do a book that was one for teachers, and he said, "Would
1:41:15
you like to consider being part of this project?" And I met with the co-author.
1:41:22
I liked his book, he was a counselor, and then we proceeded
1:41:27
to do the first edition, Culture Competence: A Primer for Educators.
1:41:31
And his name was Jerry Diller, and he came, he lived in California,
1:41:38
he came up a couple of times.
1:41:40
He had an aunt in Eugene, that's when I first talked to him, and he came
1:41:43
up a couple of times and we worked on the book, which is a very long
1:41:48
process in itself, and I don't know if there's anything particularly
1:41:53
you wanted to know about that.
1:41:56
The book itself is unusual in that it ends with interviews with specific
1:42:06
individuals of cultural communities, working with Latino/Latina students,
1:42:16
working with Native American Indian, Alaska Native students, working with
1:42:20
African American students, working with Asian Pacific American students,
1:42:24
and then I added working with, in my second edition, which is sole-authored,
1:42:30
working with Muslim and Arab American students, and I also added one on
1:42:37
working with European American students.
1:42:39
So…And then on the second edition of my book, I
1:42:50
added a chapter
1:42:56
on understanding unconscious bias, unintentional racism, and
1:42:59
micro-aggressions, and that chapter and the Muslim chapter were ones that
1:43:06
I added for my classes years before the second edition came out because
1:43:14
it was a very difficult journey trying to get a second edition out, and when
1:43:20
I couldn't work it out with the co- author when I was on my sabbatical,
1:43:25
which was when I wanted to do this, I went ahead and wrote those two chapters.
1:43:29
Well, got one chapter interviewed, and then wrote the other chapter.
1:43:35
And as it turned out, the one on unconscious bias and unintentional
1:43:38
racism ended up being published separately in a magazine where it got a
1:43:43
lot of play, and so it actually turned out better for me to have done that
1:43:48
chapter outside of the book and then change it and put it into the book.
1:43:52
So that was a pretty interesting process.
1:43:57
Anything else on the book?
1:43:59
Well, so in the book you have interviews, you have experiences,
1:44:02
student experiences from your classes, and then a big portion of it is that
1:44:09
psychological journey so that students understand that it's a process and
1:44:16
it's not just reading materials, it's that it's about their own journey.
1:44:21
Their own journey, that's right.
1:44:24
And I'm on that same journey, too.
1:44:26
It continues [laughs]
1:44:30
So let's talk about the tenure process for you, because you went
1:44:35
from student to professor, and I imagine that right when you became
1:44:39
professor the tenure clock started.
1:44:43
Can you talk a little bit about that?
1:44:45
Um...
1:44:49
it was rough [laughs] . It was really, really rough.
1:44:53
Um...I,
1:45:01
in the shorthand, I call my tenure process both unfair and unkind.
1:45:13
I believe that a lot of it had to do with some of the things that
1:45:19
were going on within my faculty.
1:45:31
I think I'd like to
1:45:35
return to that, oh, I guess I'll just keep talking about it, but I guess this
1:45:41
is part of the challenging part, which is part of it, so I'll just talk about it.
1:45:51
I don't want to make it
1:45:54
this invisible burden, invisible things that happen to me at
1:46:00
the university, all about race.
1:46:03
There was very little overt racism ever.
1:46:07
There's lots of unconscious racism.
1:46:17
Some of my faculty members, I believe tried to help me out, but they wanted
1:46:27
to help me out in directions they saw, and they couldn't get that as an
1:46:32
African American my path was going to be different, and my research instead
1:46:37
of being mentored, was sort of being channeled, and this resistance, both
1:46:43
mine to do where they thought I ought to go, and theirs to my going the
1:46:51
way that I was feeling led, and where my, no one else was in multicultural
1:46:55
education, so how would they know?
1:47:00
made my collegial relationships strained, and as I began to understand more fully
1:47:05
the institutional and societal racism that prevailed around us at a level that
1:47:11
I had not known before, I could see myself moving further and further away from
1:47:17
my colleagues' liberal understandings.
1:47:19
The Letter from Birmingham Jail that I read just a while ago, and my
1:47:23
understanding of Nigrescence, racial identity development, helped me to
1:47:29
understand what was happening, but I believe my colleagues shut me down.
1:47:34
I think comments like "race has nothing to do with it" when it clearly does,
1:47:39
even though white eyes don't see it.
1:47:41
When someone would say "when you don't get what you want, you play the race
1:47:45
card," I mean, that was said to me.
1:47:46
I'm going, "well I have to be black 24/7, you know, I'm going to see it. I
1:47:51
can't not see it, you know?" Black eyes.
1:47:54
And I believe, that the sense was "Jean is not collegial." And in the
1:48:01
promotion tenure process, no matter what anyone tells you, if someone
1:48:06
wants you, they're going to figure out a way to get you, and if they don't,
1:48:11
they're going to figure out a way not.
1:48:13
I think one exception is if someone, if someone...I think that if my scholarship
1:48:22
had been much, much deeper, I would have made it, but as you can see what
1:48:28
I've read you, I didn't have time to do the kind of scholarship that I wanted.
1:48:34
When I did my sabbatical, which I'll talk about in a little while, I
1:48:37
published four articles out of that year.
1:48:39
I mean, you know, I did a lot!
1:48:41
I just didn't have time.
1:48:43
And so, a little bit squeaked through, but not much.
1:48:47
But at the point where, um...I was,
1:49:01
one of the things I remember in one of the letters was "Jean hasn't graduated any
1:49:07
PhD students." Well, there were two people who'd gotten promotion a year before me.
1:49:14
Neither one of them had either, but on my file, that was in there.
1:49:19
I go, "huh?" One of them have the same number of articles that I did, but
1:49:25
they made it through, so in some ways it was just uneven, and it was unfair
1:49:32
because I know that although you're not supposed to tell people what happens
1:49:40
when they go through the committees and stuff, I had seen other faculty
1:49:46
members let people know behind the scenes what was happening with their
1:49:52
file and what was happening with their letters, and of course, nobody told me.
1:49:58
So, most of my faculty knew that I hadn't made it months before I did, and
1:50:08
that's, that's not nice [laughs] . So,
1:50:16
I...
1:50:22
A little bit more about collegial things.
1:50:24
At some point it seemed clear to me that my full acceptance at a
1:50:27
meeting was only embraced if I left my race outside the room, and that
1:50:32
if I brought my race into it, then they didn't want to talk about it.
1:50:40
But why would I go to a meeting if I couldn't?
1:50:47
Now I was not the only faculty of color to get tenure without promotion
1:50:52
that first time, yet those I knew in fields that were not at all
1:50:56
related to race fared much better.
1:50:59
Those in objective science did not have the confounding of their
1:51:02
lives and their field in the way that those of us in ethnic studies,
1:51:06
or in my case multicultural education or education period did.
1:51:10
In my article "Implementing a Social Justice Perspective in Teacher Education:
1:51:15
Invisible Burden for Faculty of Color," a five-year self-study, I uncovered
1:51:20
this trouble and its confounding trend.
1:51:27
In this particular article, it's really nice because I divide it up into
1:51:36
the teaching, research, and advising as I did, and this particular chart in it shows
1:51:45
that over a course of five years, I was developing new courses because the needs
1:51:52
that I saw within the community and my wanting to make sure that work got done,
1:51:58
but I had to do more to meet the needs that I saw, yet again that was work that
1:52:05
was not valued, either in the promotion and tenure process, or by my colleagues.
1:52:16
Let's see.
1:52:17
Am I bitter about accepting the fact that I have to learn the differences my race
1:52:21
makes and the fact that others will not, cannot fully understand those differences?
1:52:26
Yet whenever I begin to talk to other African Americans about
1:52:29
my perspective feelings, and so on, it's as if a veil is lifted.
1:52:33
I find myself not even needing to explain.
1:52:36
I find instant understanding.
1:52:37
I find myself disclosing more and feeling safe.
1:52:42
And there were times when we had zero applications from color, of students
1:52:49
of color in our program, and my gut reaction was "I don't wanna be there."
1:52:53
And it, the thought of soldiering most of the preparation of our interns to
1:52:56
meet the needs of their future students of color was more than I wanted to
1:53:01
undertake without a smattering of multicultural faces in the cohort.
1:53:06
And this was very early on, and it was only when I knew I could get the
1:53:10
students up to Portland that I could even take a deep breath and go out.
1:53:14
So, this again, I'm going back a little bit, but this whole area of serving and
1:53:23
advising and scholarship confounded by being black, and
1:53:32
my work not being valued, had
1:53:37
a lot to do with what was happening with the promotion and tenure.
1:53:43
I entered with an incredibly strong
1:53:50
vita on Talented and Gifted Education yet was almost pushed into Multicultural
1:53:54
Education and became quite self-taught.
1:53:59
I could not, other colleagues could not believe I had received a PhD in my field
1:54:05
with no mentors in this field, and again, my struggles scholarship-wise and P and
1:54:12
T-wise had something to do with the fact that I was starting so low in my field.
1:54:18
I was at ground-zero in both my field and my understanding of myself
1:54:21
in it, for race became salient for me in a very different manner.
1:54:26
Yet that uptick happened only when I came to OSU.
1:54:32
Race was not as salient until I came to OSU, and then I got
1:54:35
there and that was the problem.
1:54:38
I went through the stages of racial identity development in their complexities
1:54:41
surrounded by white colleagues, who, like myself in the beginning,
1:54:45
thought we were at the same page in understanding the racist nature of
1:54:49
our country and the units within it.
1:54:51
My knowledge and understanding grew while theirs did not, and their
1:54:54
overwhelming presence of whiteness only challenged when I did bring things up.
1:55:00
Their reactions, as one might expect, was resistance, a
1:55:03
“blame the victim” mentality.
1:55:05
Frankly, I was not used to being the victim.
1:55:08
I don't believe I thought of myself in that role, even when I was.
1:55:11
Conflict.
1:55:12
Big conflict.
1:55:14
And as the P and T results show, the personal and
1:55:19
professional had crossed over.
1:55:21
Friendships that were unexamined on the racial levels slowly dissolve.
1:55:28
Animosity, something I very seldom struggled with, rose.
1:55:35
I remember crying that I had lost a friend when a faculty member returned
1:55:40
to a diagnosed state of paranoia and became paranoid of me and then
1:55:43
misrepresented facts to others.
1:55:45
My very environment became hostile.
1:55:48
I remember standing outside a room looking at a close group of faculty
1:55:52
that I also used to eat lunch with, yet I knew that I could only eat there
1:55:56
if I left my race outside the door; I simply could no longer do that.
1:56:00
I would say that I entered the university willing to be colorblind
1:56:03
and just do my TAG material.
1:56:04
I had presented and worked in that field for many years and race never came up in
1:56:09
the many workshops and trainings I did.
1:56:11
Now race comes up in almost every professional connection I have.
1:56:15
I'm tired of it.
1:56:16
My race consciousness should allow me to freely live my life in my brown skin,
1:56:21
but because of my white surrounds, I am constantly reminded that I am the
1:56:24
only person of African descent in most of my environments and interactions.
1:56:29
The challenges of friends over the hard times of my growth
1:56:31
and personal focus continue.
1:56:35
[let’s pause for a minute] …for getting like this.
1:56:40
We need to remember that the backdrop from my time at OSU is the backdrop
1:56:46
for the whole state of Oregon.
1:56:48
One of the facts that I share with my students and most people when
1:56:52
I have a chance to give a talk is that the statistics that in 1890
1:57:00
in the state of Oregon there were 100,000 people, and of that 100,000,
1:57:05
there were 1200 African Americans.
1:57:09
Of those, 400 lived in Portland, and 800 lived all over the state of Oregon.
1:57:20
Fifty years later, in 1940, the population of Oregon has tripled; it’s now 300,000.
1:57:30
The number of African Americans?
1:57:33
1200. The same number.
1:57:36
Why?
1:57:38
Because during those years, with the rise of the KKK, people of African
1:57:43
descent were run out of, pushed out of, burned out of the small towns of Oregon.
1:57:49
Most small towns in Oregon are all-white on purpose.
1:57:54
And, if you dig deep enough, you find this, but most people don't know this.
1:58:00
And of those 1200 that are now in the state in
1:58:04
1940, 800 of them live in about a 40 square block of Portland where
1:58:09
they were pushed, course they also went there to work on the railroads,
1:58:15
and 400 are left spread over Oregon.
1:58:18
So that backdrop tells you why the neighborhood we're sitting in right
1:58:24
now, and why Corvallis, and why the state is in the state that it is.
1:58:29
So, this overwhelming presence of whiteness is in the state, and my
1:58:35
experience at OSU is a reflection on that.
1:58:45
I think a lot about my sabbatical year.
1:58:49
Because when I got tenure without promotion, I'm thinking, "It's sort
1:58:55
of a slap in the face to get promoted, I mean for me to get tenure, but
1:59:02
then not get a raise," and I went "but now they can't get rid of me.
1:59:05
I've got tenure." It was a very strange combination to me, and one of the first
1:59:13
things I did was I wanted to quit when I heard about my, the decision
1:59:20
to give me tenure without promotion.
1:59:23
And my daughter begged me not to.
1:59:26
A lot of people begged me not to, and the thinking was, my thinking was that the
1:59:32
people for who it matters, my students whose lives I input, they don't care.
1:59:37
They don't know what my rank is.
1:59:39
They don't care how much I get paid.
1:59:41
Why should I leave?
1:59:42
My writing that goes out and affects many people,
1:59:47
whether it has "assistant" or "associate" on the bottom, it doesn't really matter.
1:59:52
So I decided :00] that I would not quit.
1:59:55
I decided to stay, but I also had Jim Loewen, author of Lies My Teacher Told Me
2:00:01
and Sundown Towns and the one who helps me with the honors college class I've taught
2:00:07
a couple of times called “Sundown Towns: The Hidden Dimension of Oregon's Racism.”
2:00:11
His book is The Hidden Dimension of America's Racism, United State's Racism.
2:00:16
Anyway, he was talking about a time that he had gotten tenure, and had then left, I
2:00:23
think he was tenure and promotion, but he left before he took his sabbatical year!
2:00:28
And I went "tenure, I get my sabbatical year," so I applied for my sabbatical
2:00:34
year a full year before it started, and the only way that I could survive
2:00:41
that year, the one after I had found out what the committee said, was I
2:00:47
knew I had a sabbatical year coming up.
2:00:50
And so when things got tough or I was feeling badly treated by
2:00:53
people, I just took a deep breath and continued to do my best, and I had
2:01:01
a great time [in my sabbatical year]
2:01:03
. One of my images was of my work with Karen Higgins [who had a sabbatical
2:01:08
the same year] . We wrote one article here [at my home] , and then we
2:01:13
wrote another article at her place.
2:01:15
I remember, we'd spend a couple days writing, and then we'd go play, and
2:01:20
I remember after we finished working on the article here, she and I took
2:01:25
a hike up to a peak here, and when I think of my sabbatical year, I
2:01:28
close my eyes and I still remember walking up to this peak with Karen.
2:01:32
It was a peak experience, and I loved my sabbatical year because I was
2:01:38
finally able to focus on the writing.
2:01:40
I didn't have the constant emails and calls, I didn't have this program lead
2:01:43
work, you know, someone did a great job taking it over during that year, and
2:01:48
I got the writing out, and so I would have worked on the second edition, but
2:01:54
the co-author wasn't ready yet, so I wrote those two chapters, and the one
2:01:58
that's been so popular, “Understanding Unconscious Bias and Unintentional Racism”
2:02:02
that was published in the Kappan was written in the very end of that year and
2:02:07
of all the things I've written, that one short six-page article, I think, is my
2:02:12
most important piece, and it has gone out to more people than anything else,
2:02:17
so that was a product of my sabbatical year—took my whole year to get to that.
2:02:23
I was quoting studies, and for this article I got to actually look them
2:02:29
and find them and read them and really get them down instead of just telling
2:02:33
my students "a researcher says" I could not name who the researcher was.
2:02:37
That was really fun.
2:02:38
I so enjoyed that, and then knowing that I was going to come back was really good.
2:02:44
What year was this, the sabbatical year?
2:02:45
Oh, I would have to look it up [laughs] . I think it was 05, 04-05?
2:02:53
[-] Is that, something like that?
2:02:55
Anyway, after the sabbatical year, enough of my colleagues had "got
2:03:02
it" as far as institutional racism and their parts in it in multiple
2:03:06
respective that I was nearly begged to go up for promotion, and my promotion
2:03:13
files and everything went through so smooth you couldn't have believed it.
2:03:18
Two years later, but it took that long ‘cause people
2:03:23
didn't get the bigger picture.
2:03:25
They didn't understand it, and it wasn't that was that much more—I don't think
2:03:30
there was that much scholarship, there was some more, but mostly I think people
2:03:36
got where I was coming from and understood more fully my, the place that I was.
2:03:43
Now I have something from a book called Our Stories II: The
2:03:48
Experiences of Black Professionals on Predominantly White Campuses,
2:03:55
and this one is called "Giving All, Getting Half," and it's the
2:04:00
story of my promotion and tenure.
2:04:03
“Giving All” meaning I gave it everything I could, and you know.
2:04:09
I put I needed to recruit students of color, outside the
2:04:15
regular channels of process.
2:04:16
I was compelled to develop new courses based on our efforts implemented
2:04:20
in social justice research.
2:04:22
I had to do that, I had to do that work.
2:04:27
But this was the list that I started and then a couple of African
2:04:31
American and faculty members on campus helped me with, and it's
2:04:38
a list of the burdens, the invisible burdens that people of color have
2:04:42
on campus, and then what we did to lighten the load on campus.
2:04:48
So, I'll read the burden, and then I'll follow it with how we lightened the load.
2:04:54
[Number] 1: People on campus are surprised to see me, based on my color.
2:05:00
Lightening the Load: Park close to building, limit walks on campus
2:05:05
[make office an oasis], go with a colleague for distraction, go to the
2:05:11
same places where I am already known, self-talk before walking on campus.
2:05:19
Occasionally there is an overtly racist act in my presence that
2:05:22
surprises and disturbs me.
2:05:24
[Did I really see/hear that?
2:05:26
Yes, I did!] Lightening the Load: Ignore as possible, but process.
2:05:32
Sometimes confront.
2:05:34
Reacting to verbal and nonverbal responses to my presence on campus is
2:05:40
a level of mental and emotional work that most of my colleagues do not share.
2:05:45
[I can] reduce level of mental and emotional work by limiting exposure.
2:05:52
People are more likely to exhibit prejudice from unconscious rather
2:05:55
than conscious bias, and may not recognize when this is happening.
2:05:58
However, the fact that this bias exists IS often in my consciousness
2:06:04
and therefore a level of mental and emotional work that most of my colleagues
2:06:10
do not share.[What do I do?
2:06:13
I] Act as if it is not there, assume the best.
2:06:16
In some situations, it is possible to make unconscious biases conscious.
2:06:22
Oregon has a particularly racist past.
2:06:24
My race and my reading of Oregon history have made me more consciously aware of
2:06:28
this than my colleagues and students.
2:06:29
I am more likely to see this than my colleagues and students.
2:06:30
I am more likely to see and be reminded of the current consequences of past racism.
2:06:35
For example, while reading a student’s statement, “there was little diversity in
2:06:39
my community,” I am very aware that the person who made the statement is probably
2:06:43
totally ignorant of why this phenomenon occurs in Oregon,exclusion laws, early and
2:06:49
wide-spread KKK, numerous sundown towns.
2:06:52
Every time I read such statements, I am reminded of the history that
2:06:56
produced this student’s monocultural upbringing.[What can I do?] Recognize that
2:07:01
students’ and others’ perspectives may simply be a factor of their upbringing.
2:07:07
Forgive ignorance.
2:07:08
Some of my students question my competency based on their overt or covert racism.
2:07:18
This raises the standard[s] I must hold in my teaching.[I can] Continue
2:07:23
to do my best [to lighten that load].
2:07:26
Having faced dead ends because of race or gender in the past, I am more likely
2:07:31
to fear such in the future, so I tend to rely on my own resources when possible.[I
2:07:36
will] Try to trust and collaborate.
2:07:40
I am asked to teach or speak in some areas and am assumed to have specialized
2:07:45
knowledge based solely on my race.[I will] Consider each request and respond
2:07:50
appropriately if I actually possess the knowledge and perspective needed.
2:07:55
My adaptations to these differences and multiple realities include
2:07:58
my understanding[s] of these differences and realities and the
2:08:01
fact that others may not understand.
2:08:03
This causes me to be divided in my own perspective taking
2:08:06
as I recognize both viewpoints.
2:08:08
This may result in my participating in my own oppression through acknowledging
2:08:16
and inadvertently accepting the other perspective[s].[To lighten the load
2:08:21
I] Try to maintain my own perspective and not add to my oppression.
2:08:26
I am surrounded by people who do not share my racial burden [the items in
2:08:31
this list] [for instance].[My] Lightening the Load: [I] Network at conferences.
2:08:36
Become involved with integrated staffs
2:08:40
in distant locations so that I am in contact with people who
2:08:43
do share my racial perspective, and/or work in diverse settings.
2:08:49
I have to decide whether to reveal the race-based nature of
2:08:52
some of my actions and decisions [such as constructing this list].
2:08:56
That may add to the burden of race and may cause increased distance.
2:08:59
Lightening the [Burden] Do it when expedient and necessary.
2:09:03
Pick and [choose] battles so that I [may]live to “fight” another day.
2:09:10
My colleagues reading this list may be tempted to say “move on,” or come
2:09:14
up with an oppression they experience occasionally and say it is the same.
2:09:18
[I Lighten the Load][by forgiving and by understanding.]
2:09:23
So
2:09:27
based on that list it sounds like, to me, and feel free to clarify, that as
2:09:39
one of the very few people of color on the OSU campus, perhaps
2:09:45
you feel like you have to
2:09:49
explain to people how they have biases and explain to people their prejudice
2:09:53
attitudes, and that list of lightening the load, it sounds like it's about
2:10:00
understanding that you can't change everyone's perspective, but you pick and
2:10:05
choose your battles, and you, sometimes you do have to take that activist stand,
2:10:12
and sometimes you have to let things go.
2:10:14
Is that sort of the point of that list?
2:10:16
-Correct.
2:10:17
Yes, it is, but I think that by writing it down,
2:10:24
it, well we know that journaling helps you with difficult things anyway,
2:10:29
and when you look at my list of publications, it's pretty interesting
2:10:33
to see how many of them are particularly related to my role on campus.
2:10:38
I sort of had to write about it.
2:10:40
When I first started writing about it, I had a whole series
2:10:43
called "views through lenses
2:10:47
of color." I started them when I was a graduate student and I
2:10:53
continued having some of these.
2:10:54
I would often not give them to anyone, and some of those have been excerpted
2:10:58
into some of them my articles.
2:11:02
I think, for the most part,
2:11:06
when you get to know someone, you reach below, beyond, above race.
2:11:15
I mean, of course you do.
2:11:16
And, of course that's happened on campus.
2:11:21
I have, and I'll talk about my enduring friendships when
2:11:26
we get to a later question.
2:11:31
The white gaze, knowing that people are looking at you, usually through
2:11:40
unexamined racial lenses because of our embedded society racism, is really
2:11:47
tiring, and I, I think I just need to go somewhere where there are more
2:11:53
people of color, more often, and some people see OSU as very diverse, but
2:12:00
it's pretty much like U of O was.
2:12:03
Well, it's more like Berkeley was when I as an undergraduate there, the percentage
2:12:08
of students of color was about the same.
2:12:11
So, I don't know if that answers your question [laughs] . Yeah?
2:12:16
Alright.
2:12:16
Well let's go with... [shuffle papers]
2:12:19
So, we've been discussing your challenges at OSU, but can you elaborate a little
2:12:26
bit more on your challenges, both professional and personal, that you faced?
2:12:32
Um...well I think the list I read talks about it quite a bit.
2:12:38
Obviously, just difficult times for me, and things were quite challenging.
2:12:44
I like this quote from Cornel West, which I just got this recently:
2:12:48
The country is in deep trouble.
2:12:50
We’ve forgotten that a rich life consists fundamentally of serving
2:12:53
others, trying to leave the world a little better than you found it.
2:12:56
We need the courage to question the powers that be, the courage
2:12:59
to be impatient with evil and patient with people, the courage
2:13:02
to fight for social justice.
2:13:04
In many instances we will be stepping out on nothing, and
2:13:08
just hoping to land on something.
2:13:10
But that’s the struggle.
2:13:11
To live is to wrestle with despair, yet never allow despair to have the last word.
2:13:18
And, despair is strong, overwhelming emotion, and I would say that there
2:13:26
were many times during my, at OSU that that feeling arose from me.
2:13:32
There were strands that I can follow to help explore that, both
2:13:39
personally and professionally.
2:13:41
The list I gave you does it... [pause, shuffle of papers]
2:14:11
When I think about the challenges I faced, the clearly reaching out and grabbing my
2:14:19
students and keeping them near and dear and willing to take this journey, holding
2:14:25
them, in some cases by their hands, but knowing that I need to help change their
2:14:31
hearts before I can change their minds.
2:14:35
Or, “change” isn't the right word.
2:14:37
It's like, open them up so they can see how to become their better selves,
2:14:44
and also that they might have, without thinking about it, they've inhaled
2:14:52
racism in the very air they breathe.
2:14:54
And I was asked to do an instruction manual for my class, and I want to
2:15:01
just talk a little bit about how my challenge to meet the students'
2:15:08
needs finally got articulated when I wrote this just a couple months ago.
2:15:13
For all my courses I believe that well-begun is half-done.
2:15:17
Therefore my first and fore-most goal is to ensure a safe and
2:15:22
secure learning environment.
2:15:24
I also do all that I can to ensure that my classes are brain-compatible.
2:15:29
I often tell my students how they are brain-compatible.
2:15:33
I want to both teach them in a brain-compatible manner, and I want
2:15:37
them to teach their students in a brain- compatible manner, and many
2:15:41
of these compatible ways, as you will see, clearly are going to be helpful
2:15:48
with diverse student populations.
2:15:51
One is an absence of threat.
2:15:52
Students are more-able to engage in learning when there's
2:15:55
no real or perceived threat.
2:15:58
At the beginning of class I have them sign up for a partner.
2:16:03
They have this clock and they make 12 appointments.
2:16:05
I call it "speed dating" and they [laughs] for my class and then every week they
2:16:11
meet with this one person to get off their chests in the first ten minutes of
2:16:16
class what's bothered them or troubled them in the reading, or just to connect,
2:16:21
and then that safety in one person has made it so they have had that time.
2:16:27
I also remove threat of grades.
2:16:31
We have a scoring guide.
2:16:33
I have a lot of carefully crafted assignments and a
2:16:37
clear matrix for grading.
2:16:39
The material itself is intense, and if they've survived it, perhaps thrived
2:16:44
it, I'm reasonably going to accept their self-assigned grade, and you can bet
2:16:49
that's usually an "A." The students are aware of this process the first
2:16:55
hour of class, and I've removed the fear of a poor grade immediately as a
2:16:59
barrier for their learning, so they're not afraid to discuss openly the taboo
2:17:04
topic of race, and the other isms that that we talk about in our classes.
2:17:10
The freedom from grade anxiety is key.
2:17:12
Meaningful content, real-life context, the first thing they do
2:17:17
is pick a quote, quote they like.
2:17:20
In-fact, I used to take the quotes and I'd post them all over the halls if
2:17:24
I could, or in classrooms, and these bulletin boards would get huge amounts
2:17:29
of quotes, and people would be walking and they'd stop and they'd read them,
2:17:32
and I would be encouraged by the quotes that my students put up on the board.
2:17:36
They didn't have to be multiculturally related; a lot would.
2:17:39
Some would pick sayings from their faith.
2:17:42
It didn't matter.
2:17:43
I let them choose them and put them up.
2:17:45
I never had a hateful quote put up.
2:17:47
They were always positive and nice, but I remember an older woman who worked in
2:17:52
the office had the responsibility of removing the quotes off the board, and I
2:17:59
still have them, by the way somewhere, a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot
2:18:02
of them, off the board, and I went up and I watched her, and she was crying!
2:18:07
And I asked her, "Why are you crying?" She said "I am just so moved by these quotes."
2:18:11
So the very first day in class, my students put some of themselves
2:18:16
up for everyone else to see, so I begin to bring them out of
2:18:20
themselves with meaningful content.
2:18:22
And the other thing, of course, is the journals, I gave you
2:18:24
some examples about that, and
2:18:33
I give them a rich environment.
2:18:35
We take two field trips.
2:18:37
One is usually a diverse school, even if it's just for a few hours, and the
2:18:40
other one we go walking through town from the university to the river, and
2:18:46
we pretend we're someone else, we're walking through Corvallis and they can
2:18:50
choose whether they're blind or deaf or taller or smaller than they are, or
2:18:56
skinnier or fatter than they are, female if they're male, male if they're female,
2:19:02
different color skin, whatever they want, and then they just imagine what it's
2:19:05
like to walk through town in the images they see reflected in different places.
2:19:09
That's another way I bring reality to them and the content is meaningful.
2:19:15
I try to get them outside, and my tests involve movement and
2:19:20
collaboration with each other.
2:19:21
Lots and lots of choices for the brain-compatible education.
2:19:27
They choose one of three books: Lies my Teacher Told Me, Other People's
2:19:32
Children, or Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting In Together in the Cafeteria?
2:19:36
They choose one of those three books along with the textbook for the
2:19:39
coursework, and then they, sometime I also have one day of open discussion.
2:19:45
they pick any topic that's under multicultural education, and there's a
2:19:50
huge range, then they get in a discussion group for that day, so I give them
2:19:54
choices so that they're fully engaged and they're not just doing what I think
2:19:59
they should do, and if they do that with their own students, they're going
2:20:02
to be much more culturally competent.
2:20:04
They have adequate time.
2:20:06
I have very few due dates.
2:20:08
They just have to spread things out.
2:20:11
Collaboration, they work together.
2:20:14
The group oral midterm I think is just this great, great activity.
2:20:20
They always prepare, they don't really notice that there's no score
2:20:25
on the scoring guide for the midterm, or the final, there's no score, but
2:20:29
they still prepare, and they sit at a table using the clocks when there's
2:20:35
four of them, and I write all the list and things from our coursework
2:20:41
that they need to know, mental stuff.
2:20:43
I have them on the whiteboard on blanks, and then each team has to
2:20:47
go and fill in one blank in each section, and it's sort of a race, and
2:20:51
11 minutes, and then we go over it.
2:20:53
Well, what's happened?
2:20:55
Everybody's participated in it, I just have to grade what's on the
2:20:59
whiteboard, if it's a mistake, I erase it, and then we just review it.
2:21:04
And so in half an hour, they've all had to do it, and the embarrassment of not being
2:21:11
ready for this exam keeps most of them on it even though I'm not grading them.
2:21:15
So that's a collaboration, safety, no test, they're learning it, I mean it's
2:21:20
a fun day, it really is, and then after they do the fill-in, then we have the
2:21:24
essay question part, where they choose different questions from three different
2:21:30
sections, you know: why are multiple intelligence useful for cultural competent
2:21:35
teaching, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
2:21:38
So, and then immediate feedback, I try to give them during the group oral
2:21:42
midterm, of course it's instant feedback, and mastery, I try to get them to know
2:21:49
their material by putting it together at the end of the year in a synthesis
2:21:55
paper because they've had so very many different kinds of learning and they've
2:22:01
made so many choices, I almost have to do that so I can get a sense of what
2:22:05
they've done, so the challenge I think has been to keep the material in the
2:22:10
class professionally brain-compatible.
2:22:19
So, although you've had many challenges, I think it would be nice to end
2:22:26
talking about some of your triumphs at OSU, and those good experiences,
2:22:33
and your legacy, because you've done so much good so I think we need to
2:22:39
definitely talk about that work.
2:22:42
Okay.
2:22:44
On one level, I am happier with the OSU-related friends I have now, than the
2:22:50
one friend [at OSU] I had when I entered, and this would be a personal triumph.
2:22:55
The TACKI group, here they are, right here, started my last full year at
2:23:03
OSU, and some of us meet together about once a month in some manner yet, if
2:23:08
I'm on campus as we plan ahead, putting the initial of the day of the group
2:23:14
on the front of our afternoon caching and kegging intelligentsia, so if it's
2:23:20
a Tuesday, it’s a Tuesday afternoon caching and kegging intelligentsia.
2:23:28
It's far more than just the fun activity; it would be the closest I
2:23:33
have to a professionally connected,
2:23:38
positive, social, and often intellectually stimulating group.
2:23:45
In May 2010, I casually said to my husband "I wonder if I can get 65 geocaches
2:23:50
on my 65th birthday.” Now geocaching is a game you play using a GPS and
2:23:55
you find these things hidden all over.
2:23:59
There's a million and a half all over the world.
2:24:02
I'm nearly at 2,500 myself and the people in the picture there
2:24:07
are well over 10,000 together.
2:24:13
It's a game.
2:24:14
It's an adventure.
2:24:16
It's a way to get exercise.
2:24:18
My husband laughed when I told him I was going to get 65 on one day.
2:24:22
I told the TACKI group about it, and planning started.
2:24:26
I’ll share the events using the geonames of the participants; their real first
2:24:29
names are listed on the photo of the day.
2:24:31
But here’s the key.
2:24:33
After we had a date, I put the date on my work calendar and
2:24:38
then went to the invite attendees
2:24:42
for the four people of the group who were OSU employees, they all responded “yes”
2:24:50
and they had to plan to take the day off from work, ‘cause it was on a Wednesday.
2:24:58
But for me it says a lot about friendship that a group of people are willing to
2:25:04
get together for a day off to help me celebrate and have an adventuresome day.
2:25:11
I am going to stop here to briefly tell a story that happened in my life
2:25:18
the day before we did this 65 for 606, because 606 is my geocaching name.
2:25:31
My husband and I had just driven back from Sun Valley, Idaho and he had had, I’m
2:25:39
going to start earlier.
2:25:42
The day before he,
2:25:47
you know what let’s just skip that last part.
2:25:49
I’m not sure I’m going to talk about this.
2:25:52
By the time we met at 5:30 am on Wednesday October 27th, Rytmss,
2:25:58
our organizer leader, had assigned each person in this group a role.
2:26:03
Kgones would drive, Rytmss would navigate, Bbelly and Trex would record
2:26:08
while Geogecko99 and Salmondan would jump out with me to grab the cache.
2:26:12
Toward the end Fox55alive joined us in his car and came along, to end the day Rytmss
2:26:19
put in a cache whose name was 65-4-606.
2:26:24
606 spells “mom” on the phone keys, as I began the journey, the adventure
2:26:28
and game because my son was on it. We began the day at my mother’s house at
2:26:33
5:30 am in Salem, where she had some coffee and muffins waiting for us.
2:26:38
There I was surprised with bright yellow matching T-shirrs that said,
2:26:42
“I survived 65-4-606.” Including a couple of caches that took a walk with
2:26:49
all of us, we triumphed at 3:06 pm.
2:26:54
I smile when I think of how this group enlivened and enhanced
2:26:59
my last few years at OSU.
2:27:03
I had planned my two face to face classes for the late afternoon on Tuesdays,
2:27:09
having one from 2- 3:50 [TCE 519]
2:27:14
and another from 4-5:50 [TCE
2:27:20
219].
2:27:21
That class went to three credits so for awhile that class went
2:27:25
from 4 to almost 7:00] pm.
2:27:26
So that was a series of classes from 4-7 in the afternoon.
2:27:30
Sometimes
2:27:33
on the first day I stand before the class knowing that if I do it the way I hope,
2:27:39
I will change lives and sometimes I do.
2:27:43
It is emotionally draining and physically tiring to do these classes in a row.
2:27:51
For the last two years at OSU, we would have a TACKI group
2:27:54
at lunchtime, on Tuesdays.
2:27:57
Sometimes we would be able to start at 11:30 and/or go until 1:30.
2:28:01
Surprisingly, most days the cache hunt included a short hike.
2:28:05
What would my students have missed if their instructor had not had this
2:28:09
refreshing and energizing midday break?
2:28:12
We have memories.
2:28:14
The one most often shared to others by the person who witnessed it, was the
2:28:18
trip to one particularly difficult cache.
2:28:20
It was in the middle of a large cement culvert under the
2:28:23
road near the sheep facility.
2:28:25
It was raining off and on that day and there was about
2:28:27
5 inches of water in the pipe.
2:28:30
There were rocks and blackberry vines on the slope leading down to where
2:28:33
the culvert went under the road.
2:28:35
I took off my teaching-shoes, put the corner of my longish skirt in my mouth
2:28:40
so it would not get wet and waded in.
2:28:43
It was cold and I could not be sure of my objective in the culvert under the road.
2:28:49
I also did not want to appear in class too muddy.
2:28:52
So I carefully backed out.
2:28:54
I walked back to my car along the bicycle path barefooted so that I would not get
2:28:58
the inside of my shoes dirty or wet.
2:29:01
That was what I call an evil cache.
2:29:04
I got it eventually [laughs] and then I went to teach.
2:29:09
There are many caches all around campus and eventually I found them all.
2:29:12
Hidden many myself, but not on campus, though Rytmss, one of the cachers does.
2:29:18
My friend count at OSU, considering a level of relationship that are not
2:29:25
built on just personal interactions during work related events.
2:29:32
At OSU, I had one before I entered, I lost her.
2:29:36
I made and lost one.
2:29:39
One that I will never know if there is a friendship there or not, I don’t think so.
2:29:43
I made lasting, four friends.
2:29:48
Through geocaching I made lasting, three friends.
2:29:54
In Corvallis, I made one sporadic, but lasting.
2:29:58
And then through geocaching.
2:30:04
I made some acquaintances though they didn’t become friends.
2:30:08
So that makes, I think I got my count about 8 friends and that is a
2:30:13
personal triumph for my time at OSU.
2:30:16
There are some fond acquaintances, some colleagues I will
2:30:20
remember with warm feelings.
2:30:22
And there are people I will be happy to never see again.
2:30:25
Amazingly I leave OSU with warm feelings and connections
2:30:29
with both Sabah and Ed Ray.
2:30:31
I remember my journey at OSU as one of awakening and of sometimes great pain.
2:30:39
Despair does sometimes fit.
2:30:41
I was surprised the feelings that preparing for this interview awakened.
2:30:45
Just a very uncomfortable few days.
2:30:49
I am amazed at all I could accomplish with so much undercurrent, while I was there.
2:31:01
My biggest triumph professionally was the publication of the second edition
2:31:06
of my textbook, though that did not happen until I reached emeritus status.
2:31:11
I marvel that, as far as I know, I am the only one in the
2:31:14
elementary education faculty to produce a single-author textbook.
2:31:18
And they hesitated to recognize my national standing and influence?
2:31:22
And I know that the Immersion Program has made an incredible difference
2:31:25
in the lives of 100 MAT students and 1000’s of their students.
2:31:33
I was interviewed by a student from a woman leadership class and this is a
2:31:40
lot about my work and I would like to, second to the last ending, share it.
2:31:47
For my Woman’s Leader Interview I interviewed Jean Moule.
2:31:50
Dr. Jean Moule presented with her sister at the Oregon Women in Higher
2:31:55
Education Conference this past January.
2:31:57
I was extremely impressed with their presentation and intrigued with
2:32:01
what an amazing woman Dr. Moule was.
2:32:04
After emailing her on a whim she agreed to be interviewed,
2:32:06
and I was thrilled and nervous.
2:32:08
On Monday, February 4, 2008, I journeyed to her office with my
2:32:12
questions in hand and ready to be on time and make use of her busy time.
2:32:17
When she appeared running in from a meeting that had kept her late she
2:32:20
seemed frazzled but happy to meet me.
2:32:22
She offered me a place to sit and we were on our way.
2:32:25
However, what amazed me during my five prepared questions was how genuine,
2:32:29
forthcoming and nervous she seemed to be.
2:32:31
I was the one who was nervous because she is the amazing leader.
2:32:34
My thought going into this interview was that people asking to interview
2:32:39
her must happen all the time.
2:32:42
But this nervousness translated to great humility and authenticity.
2:32:47
My respect for her grew.
2:32:49
I began by asking her for her definition of a leader.
2:32:53
She said that a leader is “someone who sets a goal or vision that no one else
2:32:59
can see and helps themselves and others get there.” She also used the phrase
2:33:06
“a guide on the side not a sage on the stage.” I followed up by asking her
2:33:12
whether she believed she is a leader.
2:33:14
She replied by starting that there are three things she
2:33:17
sees a person can do in life.
2:33:18
The options are: lead, follow, and get out of the way.
2:33:23
She deeply believed that she can never follow.
2:33:25
She learned that about herself as a little girl.
2:33:27
She will though, get out of the way if the movement is not where she wants to go.
2:33:31
But ultimately she will tend to take the lead if no one else follows,
2:33:36
even if no one else follows.
2:33:38
At this point she wanted to go off the record and tell me
2:33:40
several ways she had lead alone.
2:33:43
I was amazed at her honesty and willingness to let me
2:33:45
into these parts of her life.
2:33:47
I followed with asking her how being a woman has made a difference
2:33:52
in her leadership style.
2:33:54
She moved back to the conversation with the idea she is more drawn
2:33:57
to a consensus than leadership.
2:34:00
She says that being a woman makes it difficult to be a leader.
2:34:03
Also that being a black woman makes it difficult to be a leader.
2:34:07
This is mainly because others do not accept her in a leadership role.
2:34:11
She said that sometimes it is just too big of a fight.
2:34:13
Instead she tries to get things going by influencing.
2:34:17
Basically, she sees herself as more of an activist and agitator.
2:34:21
She will just start walking in the direction she needs to go
2:34:24
and will hope that others join.
2:34:26
Moule then concluded her answer to my question by stating that
2:34:29
she feels she must be the voice for those who have no voice.
2:34:33
She has to do this.
2:34:35
My fourth question asked her about how her leadership journey has looked.
2:34:42
She responded by saying that in looking back to her youth for comparison she
2:34:46
now has more confidences in sense of direction that she has to take.
2:34:50
She now knows that the direction she is going is a good one.
2:34:54
My final question asked her who her leaders were.
2:34:57
She listed: for politics Avel Gordly, a State Senator for
2:35:02
Oregon, and in history Fannie Lou Hammer, a civil rights activist.
2:35:07
Her next three leaders were really touching to me because they
2:35:10
were all women from the Bible.
2:35:12
Esther from the Old Testament inspired Moule because she did what she needed
2:35:16
to do for her people and said “if I perish, I perish.” The other two women
2:35:22
from the New Testament were both from the New Testament and were both women
2:35:27
I had never heard of, Lydia and Junias.
2:35:31
Junias was the only woman apostle of Jesus and Lydia was a deacon in the New
2:35:35
Testament of the Bible and the first convert to Christianity in Europe.
2:35:40
Moule’s inclusions of these women inspired me because in my leadership
2:35:44
journey I seek to blend my academic learning of leadership with my Christian
2:35:48
faith and having great women of scripture pointed out as a leader fills
2:35:52
me with joy, pride and direction.
2:35:55
Moule’s last few leaders were Obama, because she wanted to include a man,
2:36:00
who she saw a great voice of change and was inspired how he knows to work
2:36:04
with people and to get people to agree.
2:36:06
This is a skill she wishes she was more proficient in.
2:36:09
She also mentions President Ed Ray because of the great things she believes he has
2:36:14
done for the Oregon State University.
2:36:17
Moule ultimately claims her children are her great leaders because the lead
2:36:21
her to new knowledge and understanding and she likes to follow them.
2:36:26
After the interview we said goodbye, and I was left reflect on this humble
2:36:29
yet strong and inspiring woman; who I believe is a great leader.
2:36:38
On a professional level, I would have to say that speaking at the commencement
2:36:42
was a high point of my life.
2:36:47
I went through 20 drafts.
2:36:49
I asked 20 different people for feedback; I spent a lot of time on it.
2:36:59
This was in 2003:
2:37:05
As a guide on the side, the first course assignment I give my students
2:37:10
is to select a guiding quote.
2:37:12
I often borrow from the quotes students post near my office or on the web.
2:37:18
The one by the phone reminds me, “The first step to wisdom is silence; the
2:37:24
second is listening.” The quote on my computer me gets me through writer’s
2:37:28
block, “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” And the quote over
2:37:34
my desk quiets my frustration with, “You may not be able to change the
2:37:38
world, but at least you can embarrass the guilty.” Our quote for today is,
2:37:45
“A genius is someone who aims for something that no one else can see,
2:37:49
and hits it.” I would like each of us to find an application for this quote.
2:37:55
So let’s just take a moment to substitute a term for “genius” that we can live with.
2:38:00
You could insert “innovator” or “risk-taker,” “change agent,” “one
2:38:05
who makes a difference,” or “tenacious going-to-get-this-done hard worker.”
2:38:12
If “genius” works for you, use it.
2:38:16
Here’s a little story to illustrate the quote: At a 4th of July picnic a few years
2:38:23
ago at a friend’s farm in the Cascade foothills, the guys held a shooting match.
2:38:29
Although I had never fired a gun before, I decided to integrate
2:38:34
the match…they needed a woman.
2:38:38
I was handed a rifle used by our host to protect himself from
2:38:42
grizzly bears in Alaska -- a 45.70.
2:38:47
As I struggled to balance the heavy thing, snickers began: “Just shoot it, Jean”
2:38:52
and “be careful; it’s loaded.” There were targets at 25 and 50 yards and a
2:38:58
10 inch bright green saw blade in a tree 100 yards way -- that’s a football field.
2:39:07
I was about to pull the trigger when the owner of the gun leaned over and
2:39:11
whispered in my ear aim a little high.
2:39:17
I did.
2:39:18
I nearly fell backward from the recoil…Everyone was watching me…except
2:39:24
one guy looking through a pair of binoculars, who asked, “Jean, what were
2:39:29
you aiming at?” “The saw blade,” I said.
2:39:34
He said “It’s gone.”
2:39:38
The remnants of the saw blade hang in my office to remind me to aim a little higher
2:39:43
and a little farther at those points that both myself and others can barely see.
2:39:50
I recall another time that aimed high, reaching for a mark
2:39:52
that my teacher could not see.
2:39:54
I disliked history or, more accurately, the monocultural perspective I was
2:39:58
taught and I had to repeat a U.S. History class in summer school.
2:40:03
I put my heart into it this time and wrote a stirring, creative beginning
2:40:06
to my paper on the Oregon trail.
2:40:09
My teacher did not believe me, an African American student, when
2:40:13
I told her I wrote it myself.
2:40:16
Discouraged by her low estimation of ethnic minorities, I did not
2:40:21
bother finishing the research paper and received another low grade.
2:40:27
Her skepticism and her assumptions hampered my interest in
2:40:31
writing as well as in history.
2:40:34
Much later, as a classroom teacher, I found Oregon history peculiarly
2:40:38
intriguing: Oregon hosted on its soil a moment of inclusion when a
2:40:44
Black man, Clark’s slave, York, and a Native woman, Sacajawea, voted
2:40:50
along with rest of the expedition for the location of its winter camp.
2:40:55
Yet, Oregon’s history is marred by racist laws, including one exclusion
2:41:01
law that prohibited blacks from settling in the territory altogether.
2:41:07
Violators were to be whipped every six months, the law declared “until
2:41:11
he or she shall quit the state.” A later version merely assessed Blacks,
2:41:19
Chinese, Hawaiians an annual $5 tax for the privilege of living in Oregon.
2:41:25
This legacy of exclusion is seen today in the absence of People of
2:41:29
Color in many Oregon communities.
2:41:32
In the refreshingly candid and honest work I receive from my students at OSU,
2:41:37
I often see a willingness to consider how such matters affect us today.
2:41:43
One student shared that when he is around people who are not from what
2:41:47
he calls the “White Protestant norm,” he sometimes feels uncomfortable.
2:41:52
He attributes this to his lack of childhood experiences.
2:41:55
He said, “I’m not racist, but… I’m just not used to being around them.”
2:42:02
As he heard the subtle racism in his own statement, he realized that
2:42:06
he had used the phrase before and
2:42:11
had heard it said many times around him.
2:42:14
My son says that when he hears “I’m not a racist but….” It is a guarantee
2:42:19
that the rest of the sentence is.
2:42:21
Not willfully racist, but hurtful none the less.
2:42:24
Other quotes from my class “I will never tell a racist joke, so I’m not
2:42:29
a racist, but…I have laughed at other people’s racist jokes,” and in the
2:42:33
course, “It will never again be okay to laugh at a racist joke or even to keep
2:42:39
silent when one is being told.” These students are beginning to understand
2:42:43
their own roles in the subtle, often, hidden racism that surrounds us all.
2:42:49
Every term, my students report to me that when they take the time to open
2:42:53
their eyes they notice that while shopping, while driving, while meeting,
2:42:59
People of Color are treated differently.
2:43:01
One said “Race shouldn’t matter, but in this country, it still does- to everyone.”
2:43:08
Let’s take my own case.
2:43:10
I am one of very few African American faculty members at OSU.
2:43:15
What is it like to be this brown face in a sea of whiteness?:It
2:43:21
is as if we are all on a river that flows quietly and gently along.
2:43:27
Most of my friends, students, and colleagues float on this river
2:43:32
in a strong, sturdy boat of their majority status - a boat I cannot
2:43:38
get into because I am not White.
2:43:41
The river, our societal mainstream, is accepted and hardly noticed.
2:43:47
I manage to swim or float alongside the boat as I am learning how
2:43:52
to navigate this mainstream.
2:43:55
Every once in awhile someone in the boat notices my struggle and tosses out
2:44:00
an inner tube or briefly holds my hand.
2:44:03
And then sometime, someone reaches out and pushes my head under with, “Just
2:44:07
get over this race thing, Jean.” I sputter, resurface, and continue on.
2:44:14
In the long run, I figure it makes sense to construct a raft for myself.
2:44:19
So while I talk to those in the boat and we run difficult rapids together,
2:44:22
at the same time, I must lash together whatever supportive materials I can find.
2:44:29
The response?
2:44:30
“Hey, how come Jean gets a raft?” If I say, “Because I can’t get in
2:44:35
the boat with you and I’m getting tired of staying afloat without more
2:44:38
support,” some say, “What boat?”
2:44:43
Many grapple with the complex issues raised by this metaphor,
2:44:46
whether it applies to race or other areas of difference.
2:44:49
The challenge for those in the water and for those in the boat is to reach out
2:44:54
for each other on their common journey while aiming to make a difference in the
2:44:58
very river that carries us all along.
2:45:02
Now, the day that I gave this speech I continued on with words of encouragement
2:45:08
for those in the audience about how in 1903, in 1803 was Lewis and Clark
2:45:15
and getting to Oregon, in 1903 the Wright brothers flew their craft,
2:45:21
they had Sublimity connections, and in 2003 we were graduating.
2:45:29
So we ended on that; an up note that they would aim to make a difference,
2:45:34
and aim to go for a higher place.
2:45:39
And I remember when I was finished, Tim White the interim president gave me a
2:45:45
ribbon that said “I make a difference” which is a ribbon that I have given many
2:45:50
people at the university and almost all my [graduate] students at one point or
2:45:55
another have receive one of these ribbons as I told them how they make a difference.
2:46:01
But I ended the speech as the importance of aiming to make a difference.
2:46:10
I want to end this interview with an excerpt from the end of both
2:46:20
my dissertations and my textbook:
2:46:25
“The travelers stopped to rest.
2:46:27
They looked back the way they had come.
2:46:29
The path seemed longer and more difficult than they had remembered:
2:46:33
Their talk as they walked must have helped to smooth the way.
2:46:36
Now that they had the vantage point if the ridge, they saw that what
2:46:40
they had perceived as a summit had been the beginning of the foothills.
2:46:45
They continued on.”
