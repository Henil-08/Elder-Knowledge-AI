00:02
Alright, it’s February 19, 2016.
00:06
I am here in the room with Loretta Milton, Zalika Gardner, and Isaiah Adams.
00:13
And, myself, I am Dwaine Plaza, I’m doing some of the interviewing and I am
00:17
accompanied also by Natalia Fernández.
00:20
And this afternoon we’re going to spend our time really focused
00:23
on the life of Fred Milton.
00:26
But, we would also like to hear a little bit about you, Loretta.
00:29
So can you just think back to your early days here at Oregon State University
00:34
and just some background information on yourself, as much as you’d like to share.
00:40
I came up to Oregon State University as a freshman pretty, pretty naïve,
00:51
and pretty
00:54
un-acculturated to, to the big huge university, so I was kind
01:00
of scared of, kind of timid.
01:02
I
01:05
came from Roseburg, Roseburg, Oregon, we were the, the “Roseburg Indians”
01:16
- we had caricatures of Indians emblazoned on,
01:23
you know lots of places which were not kind to the Native American people.
01:30
You know, Roseburg was pretty monocultural, and I was
01:34
not exposed to much of any diversity coming from Roseburg.
01:40
So,
01:43
landing here at OSU, so I was, went through rush -they had the sororities had
01:52
these rush, it’s called Rush Week, and you interview with all the sororities,
01:58
and so I finally -that was actually my sophomore year maybe, I joined the
02:07
Delta Delta Delta sorority, so I was a --- so, when was it that I met Fred?
02:18
I had a cousin, her name was Louise, she had an apartment, and her
02:24
friend knew Mel Easley, who was a football player on, on the OSU team
02:34
so she had invited him to come and, and so Mel was buddies with Fred.
02:43
I think they actually lived together.
02:45
And
02:48
so Fred came along to
02:52
that get together and that’s when I met him.
02:58
So, that was, gosh,'60,'67 I think.
03:02
'67, okay.
03:06
And'67 was the year that the Giant Killers.
03:08
That was a big year.
03:08
The football team, you know,
03:12
gained that reputation for beating USC, beating Purdue, I think it was.
03:18
Yeah, Purdue.
03:19
Yeah, and
03:22
so they were, they were, big men on campus, you know [laughs] and yeah,
03:30
so, so after, gosh, after that meeting, you know we started dating, and it
03:42
was kind of being
03:48
-it was also blazing a trail that hadn’t been, wasn’t very, very
03:54
approved of by, by the greater society.
04:01
Interracial marriage had been outlawed, you know, a few years previous to that.
04:09
My family was absolutely aghast.
04:13
When they found out...
04:16
And, they, you know, anyway, but we persevered and
04:28
married in December of 1969, which was the same year that all of this happened.
04:34
That’s a big year.
04:34
Oh,
04:37
my gosh.
04:40
[laughter]
04:40
So, but previous to that, I, I was kind of on the periphery of, of what was going
04:48
on with the BSU and, so you know, so it was almost, almost mind boggling really.
04:55
And so I, I started collecting, you know, gosh, all these news articles that were
05:00
happening, that were being reported.
05:04
So I just busied, busied myself collecting all these articles and
05:12
what else should I add?
05:17
Then,
05:20
after the march/walkout, then Fred went up to Portland and he was helped by
05:33
Reverend Wallace of the Maranatha Church up there to find, you know, a place.
05:41
And,
05:45
oh gosh, and then I, I student taught, I was in the Education Department,
05:50
and so my student teaching happened at Raleigh Park School which
05:54
was in west, southwest Portland.
05:58
So, yeah Fred would come up and visit me from time to time, from, well, was he?
06:06
Yeah, he, my memory...
06:08
That’s okay, take your time, take a break.
06:09
Yeah, he would come and visit me there.
06:12
And then,'69,
06:17
he transferred down to Utah State University.
06:20
They gave him a scholarship to, a football scholarship to Utah State University.
06:28
And so after we were married in, in December of'69, then we went down to Utah.
06:34
Which is an even...
06:36
Whiter place
06:37
[laughter]
06:39
Yeah, yeah, so, yeah.
06:43
So, Utah.
06:45
Oh,
06:50
gosh.
06:52
So I, I was a
06:57
-they had a, they had an education laboratory, laboratories
07:01
school on that campus.
07:02
It was called the Edith Bowen Lab School.
07:06
And so I went there as a, I think I was an aide, so a teacher’s aide there,
07:16
so that’s what I did while we were in Utah.
07:20
And, and Fred was, you know, going to school, and we had an apartment.
07:24
And I remember one time, oh, oh wait, okay, also, I was hired by this
07:35
business forums cooperation called,
07:39
I can’t remember the name, but it was, they, they created business forums.
07:43
And so they, so I went to work for them, and I remember, they had us siting at
07:51
these drafting tables and apparently, so
07:59
when I left work, when I left work one, one evening, Fred picked me up from
08:06
work, and I think somebody saw he and I together and a couple days later, I, I
08:16
got fired from that job [laughs] -so yeah.
08:19
So,
08:22
so that was a little bit traumatic, but, but Fred
08:27
persevered and got through school.
08:33
Then he was recruited by the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian football team.
08:40
And so we traveled up to Montreal, Canada.
08:43
And he played for the Alouettes there.
08:50
And that was, that was quite an adventure [laughs]
08:56
Especially the warm weather, right?
08:58
Warm winters...
08:58
[laughs] Yes.
09:01
So eventually, so I worked as a waitress while he was doing the football
09:07
thing, and he, he finally decided that it was just not going to work out.
09:18
He felt like they were kind of treating, treating everybody like cattle, you
09:23
know, these, these athletes were kind of treated like cattle; I remember him
09:29
saying, “We’re treated like cattle.” And
09:34
he had a very, very heighted sense of his, his, of himself, and that was not
09:43
good for, for him to have to endure. So, so we traveled by car with a U-Haul
09:54
trailer back to Portland, Oregon,
09:58
and that’s where we lived -we had an apartment in northeast Portland.
10:05
And he, he got a job working for the police as a community.
10:14
Liaison?
10:14
Liaison person.
10:16
Yes.
10:21
And, okay, so every -so I do remember him, you know, mentioning about, you
10:31
know, not wanting to be out at night, certain, because, you know, because the
10:39
likelihood of getting arrested, driving while Black, or, was you know, a real
10:46
reality, even, even, you know, back then.
10:54
So, what should I say next?
10:59
Then he got a job with IBM.
11:03
And he was the president of his class.
11:07
The president
11:10
of, of the beginning sales people that they had hired and
11:19
so,
11:23
that, that leadership quality was always, always there.
11:32
Okay, so, he, he worked for IBM, he was a sales person;
11:43
at times he would have to travel up to Seattle for that.
11:48
Then, I’m trying to think when we had, when we had you [laughs] when we had you.
11:57
Well, I feel like I remember some reference to Seattle traveling
12:01
when I was in existence, so must have been something...
12:03
Okay,
12:06
so that must have been before -yeah, so in, so in 1973, we had our first child.
12:11
And, yeah,
12:18
and I was trying to, was I working at the time?
12:25
Anyway, so, so, okay, so then, that was...yeah, oh!
12:37
and we got our first home in Portland shortly after, after,
12:43
you must have been about
12:47
two, two and a half when we moved to our North Baldwin address.
12:56
And then we had, oh, then we moved again, and then we had Mandesa,
13:02
my second daughter in 1976.
13:08
And Fred was working for,
13:13
I think he might have been working for city government by then.
13:18
So, he worked,
13:24
gosh, my brain is, can I take a break?
13:27
[laughs]
13:28
It’s okay.
13:28
Sure, okay.
13:28
I’m going to.
13:28
Take a break.
13:29
Sure, you can take a break, and I’ll, I’ll ask Zalika to just talk a little bit about
13:34
your dad, your recollections of your dad.
13:38
What kind of man was
13:41
he like?
13:41
He was funny, which still makes me laugh, because he seems very
13:50
serious, like he, you know, you don’t want to mess with him, right?
13:56
But he’s actually goofy.
13:58
And
14:01
very warm and very wise.
14:08
He didn’t, he would either, I mean all the way through my life, but especially as I
14:14
got older, he would listen, and kind of, when I was younger he would puff on his
14:23
pipe -but then he quit smoking.
14:26
But, he would listen and then he had an amazing ability to analyze and understand
14:31
people and understand situations and give me a different viewpoint on things.
14:38
He, he just would decide, which is I think where I get it from, but
14:43
he just would decide things like, “there not a volleyball club for my
14:47
daughters to play in, I’m going to make one” and do it [laughs] okay.
14:52
Or, whatever it was, I mean he just, and
14:58
he had the ability to tell, he, he knew history, like he knew the stories of
15:04
things and he enjoyed sharing the stories of things and how they, this connected
15:09
to this, why this mattered, and he really wanted us to understand those things.
15:16
I remember him really specifically talking about, you know, being mixed, like I
15:21
don’t know how much you and dad talked about it, because you know, obviously
15:25
that was not in my earshot, but I remember my dad being very actively talking about
15:30
“this is the world sees you in this way” like “I want you to understand what
15:35
this is and, and who you are” and that kind of thing, in a very direct manner,
15:41
which I’ve always appreciated so much.
15:45
Growing up, he was very, I’ve said this before, like he was
15:49
a very understated person about his own accomplishments, right?
15:53
Like, he won stuff from when he was really young, you know, really
15:59
incredibly talented athletically and he loved sports, but you wouldn’t
16:03
know that about him necessarily.
16:05
If you sat next to him which you would know is he was analyzing the way that,
16:10
you know, “that was, this is an incredible athlete; look at the jump on this” you
16:13
know, he was a student of sport, but he never talked about his own stuff.
16:20
Athletic abilities?
16:21
Right, his own exploits.
16:24
He,
16:26
we knew growing up that he had
16:32
stories from when he was younger and when he was in Arkansas, in Pasco, but he,
16:37
he told them, he told them in a way that was like, when we would say something
16:42
like, “I’m starving!” and he’d be like,
16:46
“Starving is when you have to go kill a squirrel.” [laughter]
16:50
“You are not starving,” you know, things like that, where
16:55
The right perspective for you.
16:58
Right!?
16:58
[laughter] To gain some perspective.
16:58
He was very, very proud of his dad and the journey that his dad
17:03
had taken to change circumstance.
17:06
And he was very aware that his circumstance was dependent upon
17:12
his father’s courage and that those values like courage, loyalty,
17:17
family, were like almost entities in themselves in our house I feel like.
17:23
It was very clear to us.
17:24
I understand his dad was a sharecropper, right?
17:25
Yeah.
17:28
Worked in Arkansas.
17:30
Do you, did he, did you ever meet your grandfather?
17:33
Oh, yeah.
17:33
Okay, so what characteristics do you think that your grandfather had, as
17:37
a man who came out of the South and eventually got his family into the West.
17:41
If I understand, he came from Tri-Cities?
17:43
Yeah.
17:44
So, what kind of characteristics do you think he imparted on to your dad?
17:49
I mean, you’ve mentioned some, but are there?
17:50
Yeah.
17:54
Grandpa was, well, loyal and family.
17:56
Like, family, family.
18:00
That, that sense of courage.
18:01
I mean my grandfather traveled along the railroad, he still, until he passed into
18:05
[?] . So he would, you know, there’s some dependence there, right, but which makes
18:10
me, which would make me scared, right?
18:13
There’s a lot of things that I can’t do, but Grandpa didn’t tend to operate
18:18
in that, and neither did my dad.
18:20
Grandpa could not read,
18:24
he was... He could not read.
18:26
I remember, for a while I did checks for him.
18:29
Like I did his stuff for a little bit when I was younger.
18:33
But I think, my dad would tell a story about, tell a story about how
18:38
my grandpa would send him $50 each quarter I want to say, or semester
18:44
at school, when he was at school.
18:46
And of course $50 is not, does not pay tuition, you know, like there’s a lot
18:51
more, but he was faithful like that -he was faithful, faithful, faithful.
18:55
And that’s kind of how my dad attacked things too, in that same way.
18:58
Like, like my grandpa
19:02
worked on the railroad and, and doing -to buy a house, like
19:06
it’s a big, it’s a large journey
19:09
From sharecropper.
19:10
From stealing away, from sharecropping to being a homeowner.
19:14
That was something that my dad helped, you know, partnered with in that, in that way.
19:22
Those were some big things -they’re both funny too.
19:25
They were both funny, sense of humor.
19:28
Yeah, having a sense of humor.
19:29
So my uncle too, like for sure, a sense of humor about your reality was a
19:37
resiliency tactic [laughs] essential, essential feature
19:41
I think, when I think of him.
19:43
Loretta, looking back on, on Fred, do you think his leadership skills, and I want
19:48
you to think about the Walkout, because you were clearly there and meeting, you
19:52
were there, you understood what was going on, and how do, can you talk a little
19:55
bit about how that unfolded and why?
19:56
How Fred’s leadership may have brought that together, if you can?
20:01
I should go back to my talk [laughs]
20:02
Okay, that’s okay.
20:05
Because I,
20:09
okay.
20:11
Fred had this un, uncanny wisdom.
20:19
People, he, he was kind of a magnet for people liked being
20:24
with him he, he listened and he,
20:30
and so I think that’s why so many people, you know, when Fred was
20:36
dealing with having to defy his coach,
20:43
he had the Black Student Union to sta-, right there, right there, they were there.
20:49
And he had to make that decision not to shave his beard off and risk
20:57
the ostracizing of his teammates, the ridicule of his coaches.
21:04
He had, you know, the, the, the larger community being, being
21:14
ostracized by the larger community.
21:16
And considering that the Ku Klux Klan has this rampant history in,
21:21
in Oregon, I often wondered if he actually wondered if he was going
21:27
to be hung by a tree, you know?
21:32
Yeah, it was, it was a tremendous thing.
21:38
So,
21:44
so I just observed how strong those black athletes stood together and the Black
21:56
Student Union had leadership that wasn’t afraid to confront power, you know?
22:05
So...
22:08
Did you, did you attend any of the on-campus events when they were...?
22:11
Yes I, I they well...
22:13
Tell us about those?
22:13
They had, they had like a 5,0 people, like a third of the,
22:19
of the students at OSU attended rallies one day, my voice, one day.
22:29
And...
22:31
Grab some water.
22:31
Thank you.
22:32
Take your time.
22:38
And so 5,0 students and community members attended the athletic
22:54
coaches, the coaches, the, the athletic organization had the podium.
23:02
They were there and there were 5,0 you know, students there.
23:08
Well, at the same time the Black Student Union was holding another rally on the
23:14
other side of campus on, in a smaller do, smaller area and that’s what I went to.
23:23
And yeah, so it was, it was powerful, just campus event, you know?
23:36
And, but yeah I was just quite inspired by how well the BSU managed all of that.
23:48
Right.
23:48
I imagine the students were meeting on the other side of campus; they were
23:51
actually adamantly against the issue?
23:53
Yes!
23:54
Oh my gosh, yeah they were like ridiculing, you know?
23:59
“How could these” and they were “how could these black athletes be so uppity?
24:07
They should be grateful for their scholarships and how could
24:11
they, you know defy us?” and
24:18
yeah.
24:24
So
24:30
I mention in my talk also that
24:35
they, the same day that they issued the bulletin that they were going
24:40
to boycott classes, boycott athletic events, that same day they staged,
24:48
the BSU staged an interruption of a lecture series, a lecture that was
24:55
being done in honor of Linus Pauling.
24:59
They, they walked in, there were
25:05
how many did I say, 30, 30 black and white students that walked in led by Mike
25:13
Smith, who was the Black Student Union, Black Students President and Rich Harr
25:22
who was on the football team, they, they came in, they took the mic, they announced
25:30
this boycott that was going to happen
25:34
and that was huge courage to do that and the Gill Coliseum, that,
25:42
that venue, Gill Coliseum is named after “Slats” Gill who, who was,
25:49
didn’t, who prohibited, for 36 years, prohibited black athletes on his team.
25:56
Absolutely.
25:58
Kind of an iron, ironic thing, but...
26:01
Yeah we know about that one, Natalia and I. Yeah [laughs] yeah.
26:05
So, so.
26:08
So to give your, your grandma a little rest, Isaiah can you just tell us any
26:11
of your recollections and memories of your grandpa, as much as you’d like?
26:16
My, my grandfather, oh man.
26:21
Sorry I get caught up when she talks.
26:23
Of course
26:24
Because I, I learn
26:25
Of course
26:26
And I don’t know, I’m one, I’m very analytical in the same way that my
26:29
grandfather was and so I take these stories and I look at big pictures and
26:34
I look at who my grandfather was at the time, who my grandmother was at
26:37
the time, how did they end up together?
26:39
Me seeing the life that they lived after they had kids and when I was
26:43
around and their marriage and what can I learn from that and what, like
26:48
what, how does, how do you take a woman who had no real upbringing with any
26:55
experience like what she found in her husband and have her just, you know
27:00
travel with him, to all these different places and end up in Oregon, in creating
27:06
a stable life for not only their children, but the generation under that?
27:10
I mean, that house is a staple in our family.
27:13
And I thank her for that all the time because it’s something that I’ve never
27:17
had to worry about and so when she talks I like get lost so I’m sorry.
27:21
I’m here [laughs]
27:24
I just, I’ve been, I’ve been thinking again.
27:25
And then with my mom just talking about what, who’s my great grandfather and
27:31
I mean people like, it’s one of the proudest things that I’ve a quilt he made.
27:37
And he made it, I believe, when he was, he couldn’t see anymore and I mean he made
27:41
these quilts blind you know what I mean?
27:43
And that’s the type of stuff that’s like every time somebody sees it,
27:46
it’s like oh my great grandfather made that when he was blind.
27:49
Ah, okay.
27:50
And it’s like that’s the kind of leadership that’s in me.
27:53
Like how, how could he have known that a blanket he was making that he could not
27:58
see would cover his great grandchild?
28:01
Like, that’s the type of and so when I listen to the stories it’s like, it’s
28:06
just incredible, it’s incredible and that’s, but that’s who my grandfather was
28:09
and that’s what was in him, that like, utility, the utility, but like a goofball
28:17
[laughs] . Like I spent so much time with him, he’s who taught me what work was
28:23
and on anytime that I was like, “what are we going to be doing?” “You don’t
28:26
ask what you do, you show up” - you know?
28:29
“Well how much are we getting paid?” “You get paid which you get paid after
28:33
the work is done” [laughs] . And so you know he taught me what that was.
28:37
He taught me what manual labor was.
28:37
And yeah, so I was just, my grandfather man,
28:43
I don’t even.
28:44
There’s not enough words and so I was try to condense it and just hear everything
28:48
and what it was you know what I mean.
28:51
He was, he was the man, he was the man, you know.
28:54
Like that’s, I, I was listening to her talk and I, me being the youngest one,
29:02
I made a Facebook status about it, and all I said was “perhaps the greatest
29:05
gift that you could leave for anyone,
29:09
is a legacy that they can be proud of because it does so much for you.” My
29:14
mother and I have talked a lot about it when we first lost my grandfather
29:18
and how we just kind of wanted to climb every single mountain top and just like
29:21
scream about him so that everyone would know how important of a person the world
29:27
just lost and when you come to these things and you realize the people that
29:32
turn out, you get interviewed because of something that your grandfather did.
29:36
That it, it makes you realize that no, people do know, like he was, he’s just
29:41
as important to so many other people as he was to me for all these different
29:44
reasons and I think it’s one of the best gifts that I’ve been given in my 20 years
29:50
of being alive, is like, I forever have a legacy to be proud of, I forever have
29:55
a legacy to turn to and draw strength from, forever have that within me.
30:03
When he passed away I wrote a poem about that and it just, the first half was just
30:10
all the things that he carried within himself and the second half was just me
30:16
transitioning into all those things that he carried, I carried too and instead of
30:22
him carrying me I now carry him, you know?
30:25
With him being gone he’s a part of me so that’s just, he
30:28
was just, he was everything.
30:30
He was everything, he was so understated that like I never
30:33
knew how important little things that we use to do, really were.
30:37
I remember doing a piano recording from my great grandfather who I, I never got
30:43
the chance to meet, but looking back on it and then I hear the stories of how
30:49
important my grandfather’s father was to him, it’s like, that must have been
30:54
like monumental and I had no idea because he just made it seem so like oh yeah...
31:00
Right.
31:01
Record something [laughs] so it’s like alright [laughs] sure I’ll
31:05
do that, but it’s just crazy.
31:07
I mean, I never, I didn’t even know about this stuff until they told us the story.
31:14
Ah, okay.
31:14
He was, he was that kind of guy where it was like he didn’t ever feel the
31:19
need to boast of himself, he would never feel the need to remind you of his
31:23
accolades or his position or who he was.
31:27
I remember him always having this, he wasn’t like incredibly religious in the
31:34
traditional sense, but he always had this strong sense of “I am just a man
31:42
at the end of the day and there is a God above.” And he always used to joke about
31:46
him, “you know, I had a conversation with God the other day and he’s a pretty good
31:49
guy” [laughs] . You know what I mean?
31:51
[laughs] He used to do stuff like that where it was just like what?
31:54
[laughs]
31:54
That’s great!
31:55
[laughs]
31:55
But, yeah he was just, I mean asking me to just talk about him, you
32:00
can’t do that, we’d be here all day, but that’s where I’m at right now.
32:04
It’s just, I’m very, I just, I try to learn from it all and understand and
32:09
really what he was because the older I get, the more he becomes the me and
32:13
like it never stops giving and that’s what I meant with you know, the greatest
32:17
gift I think you can leave for someone is a legacy to be proud of, and he did
32:23
that in spades you know what I mean?
32:26
And so...
32:26
Right.
32:27
So yeah, I mean.
32:29
So Loretta, I want to come back to you again and I wanted to ask you to
32:32
reflect on the time period when the events were taking place around 1969 and
32:39
just think through for us what kinds of issues that were going on in campus and
32:46
how that Fred would have been talking to you about some of these things?
32:49
I mean, he would have been saying things to you obviously, some things happening
32:53
here, but he’s then coming home and saying Loretta I can’t believe they’ve?
32:57
Do you recall any of those conversations?
32:58
Yeah, you know my memory for specific conversations on that is,
33:05
I don’t know, I just, you know, it’s, it’s not there, it’s not there.
33:10
Okay, right.
33:11
I don’t know whether I was just wrestling with so many...
33:14
Sure.
33:14
things at that point.
33:18
And he was, you know he didn’t, you know I remember being with him
33:25
and he didn’t dwell on, on that totally, it was, he had kind of
33:33
this, this kind of joyful personality and it was just fun to be around.
33:38
He would crack jokes and stuff and he was a very great letter writer.
33:47
Okay.
33:47
Oh my gosh, he wrote beautiful letters.
33:49
Okay.
33:49
Beautiful letters.
33:51
He, I remember he wrote my, my parents before we got married.
33:58
Okay.
33:59
He wrote to them and said
34:03
you know, “I know that you’re, this is really hard for you and, but Loretta
34:12
and I are, are we’re going, we’re going forward with our relationship”
34:18
and he, he was very eloquent,
34:23
“so I don’t want to tear Loretta away from her family so I’m hoping
34:32
that you, you will be,” excuse me.
34:35
Sure.
34:35
“You will be, you will be able to come around to see that things
34:43
are good with us” and yeah.
34:47
So he wrote this very eloquent letter
34:52
and he wrote me very eloquent letters too, yeah, yes.
34:57
I was just going to say, it’s very consistent, so, because
35:02
family is so core, right?
35:03
Like he would if that makes complete sense, in what I know of him that he and I
35:10
would say it’s not the response and a lot of people would have had to, you know to
35:17
In your face...
35:18
To that, kind of...
35:18
Racism.
35:20
Yeah, but he was very much like that and I think that that is part of the
35:26
story that he, he’s so, he’s I mean integrity he, like when he takes a
35:32
stand, he takes a stand, right like of course I’m not, I mean if that makes
35:38
sense [laughs] . What I know of him, right, like when he takes a stand,
35:41
he takes a stand, but his basic heart is, is restorative and collaborative,
35:46
like that is his basic desire.
35:50
Yes.
35:52
And I think that that was something and he talked to me a little bit like about
35:57
coach Andros and he was, he talked about it in the sense of fighting a system and
36:05
that coach, coach Andros ultimately helped him do some things that like he felt that
36:11
the man himself, ultimately, he didn’t want vilified him as a human being, right?
36:22
That, that he was a part of a system and that was a stand that he took, but
36:26
that was really important to him and I think that’s important, you know in the
36:31
story that he, he was not in my life in knowing him, he was always about - and,
36:39
which not that many people are going to say can do: take a stand and invite
36:46
conversation at the same time, like that is, that is a, and that’s you know to your
36:51
point Mom, like he just had a way with people and a way of being able to invite
36:56
conversations and invite people, invite coalitions of people to, to have these.
37:04
Yes.
37:05
That kind of conversation.
37:09
During the event, as it was transpiring in ‘69, was there any sort of conversation
37:14
he was having with Coach Dee Andros?
37:16
I read about one conversation that they had, but do you; did you recall him having
37:21
dialogue of any kind that you recall?
37:25
You know, other than that initial, from the story that I gleamed is
37:30
that they had met on campus...
37:33
That’s what I heard.
37:33
And Andros saw the beard and then said, “Hey, you need to get rid of
37:38
that thing by tomorrow morning” - and, and, and, and that was, I don’t think.
37:48
I could be really wrong about that, he made have you know, had
37:53
further conversations with him.
37:56
Okay,
38:00
sure and then subsequent to that, I also read somewhere that they
38:05
eventually, eventually years later...
38:07
Yes!
38:07
Can you talk about that?
38:08
Yes, yes!
38:10
Fred was running for city commissioner.
38:15
In Portland.
38:15
In, in Portland.
38:17
No, it was county commissioner.
38:18
Okay.
38:18
County commissioner in Portland and Dee Andros came up and appeared with Fred
38:25
in a, in a, in a news, news release
38:30
supporting Fred’s candidacy and yeah.
38:34
So Fred really admired Dee Andros, he, he liked the man, he, he, he,
38:42
he accredited Dee Andros with some, you know, a lot of his success.
38:51
It was just that...
38:55
That policy, the policy?
38:57
The situation was.
38:58
The situation.
38:58
Was, was difficult.
39:00
When he talked some about the situations outside, right, of, of
39:07
being allowed to play a particular kind of music for two hours on a
39:12
Sunday when they said it was okay.
39:14
You know, like kinds of situations outside of the demand of, you know, the
39:20
facial hair and the cultural piece of that, that those kinds of conditions
39:24
that became, that people, that aren’t the ones that people talk about because
39:29
they aren’t the ones that were the most visible, what was most visible was this...
39:32
Yes.
39:33
You know, interplay between you know a coach and his player, but the, the fight,
39:38
the demonstration was about the whole.
39:40
It was about treatment on a large scale level and that was, when he talked
39:46
to me about the story that was really important for him to, you know, that
39:50
the beard started things, but this was about a way of being seen and
39:54
treated that was just unacceptable, things yeah and you know locker-rooms,
40:01
it was just the kinds of stuff that happened when you’re 57 of 14,0 [laughs]
40:08
Yeah.
40:08
And when
40:10
it’s acceptable to, he talked about professors having no expectations
40:16
of learning from, you know and his,
40:21
you can tell he went to Utah to finish his degree.
40:23
Like this was the education piece of his was a value and to be in a classroom
40:29
where you weren’t, that wasn’t important, those kinds of conditions for the
40:33
athletes that he just felt were wrong.
40:37
And Fred was an intellectual also.
40:39
Very much so.
40:41
You know, besides being gifted athletically, he was a very
40:47
probing, had a very probing mind
40:54
and yeah.
40:55
So
40:58
I, I concur with your story about, you know, how all that the black students at
41:05
OSU were under this kind of strain and
41:12
I remember,
41:16
you know, they would have parties once in a while, but they,
41:20
you know, would go off campus.
41:21
They had, I think it was Harry Gunner had a, had a, had a house
41:26
where they would sometimes go and get together at parties and
41:36
yeah.
41:37
I was going to say something else, but it just.
41:40
Sure and okay, I’ll ask you about those parties in terms of who’d
41:43
be there, that you can recall?
41:45
And that’s the other thing that happened is boy those black athletes
41:51
do not date white woman, you know, kind of thing; so yeah and, but
41:58
there weren’t African American women on campus, you know so yeah.
42:11
My, my brain is starting to...
42:12
It’s okay.
42:12
Really freeze up.
42:13
Ok, we can stop whenever you’re ready and, and I can actually just keep
42:19
asking the younger folks some of the questions and then maybe it’ll
42:21
jog some of your understanding.
42:23
So in, in as you’re growing up then did you, did your grandfather
42:26
give you any advice on, in terms of meeting other people and who, who
42:31
what groups you hang out with or was he that kind of person who would be
42:33
very open to having friendships and relationships with anybody and everybody?
42:39
I think that was the lesson.
42:41
Okay.
42:42
Was that, that’s how you have to live.
42:45
Is anybody and everybody,
42:50
is welcome and is worthy of your time
42:55
and to treat everyone with just respect.
43:00
I think that, I mean did he, was, did he think that I should do certain things?
43:05
Of course, did he think that, you know, did he push school?
43:07
Absolutely.
43:08
Did he, you know, tell me who it was a better idea to be around and
43:12
what was probably not the best?
43:13
Absolutely.
43:14
But I think the overall thing was more, you know, be well rounded, treat
43:20
everyone with respect, treat everyone like a superstar because they are.
43:26
That was, as far as like influence, that stuff, that’s where it was at.
43:29
I mean he had a huge love and appreciation for school, education, learning, and his
43:35
big thing with me was to have a plan and to hold myself accountable to that plan.
43:43
I remember that was a lot of our conversations at the, we had a dining
43:47
room table that we use to sit and talk at for hours [laughs] . Hours, I would go
43:53
over there to do homework and spend the first three hours talking to him and we
43:56
didn’t realize it was happening, meanwhile Grandma is just bringing snacks and we
44:01
don’t even realize what’s happening, we’ve gone through like two grilled cheeses and
44:06
[laughs]
44:06
. That was his thing for me, was, “What’s your plan?
44:12
what are your goals?
44:13
Write your goals down, keep yourself accountable, don’t, don’t have lazy
44:17
goals” was his big thing with me.
44:20
I remember because often my goals would kind of be loosely ended,
44:27
“oh I’m going to get straight A’s this year” “Well, what does that mean, what’s
44:31
really your goal, how are you going to do that, what’s your timeline?” And I
44:34
was always like, “oh you know by the end of the year” and he’s like “no, no, no
44:36
that’s a lazy goal” [laughs] . And that means you can do whatever and as long as
44:41
it fits within this, you, you achieved it and he’s like, “that’s not how it
44:44
works” so that was a big thing for him.
44:47
Again the work ethic was a huge thing for him with just you show
44:51
up to work and you do the work.
44:53
If you’re going to do it, you sign up and you do it.
44:55
There’s all these other questions are, they’re not necessary and they
45:01
ultimately cloud you, if there’s work you show up, you show up on time,
45:05
you do the work, you do all of it.
45:07
Right.
45:08
And you go home when it’s done.
45:11
Did he ever encourage you into following athletics at all because
45:16
I didn’t hear anybody talk about it?
45:17
He encouraged me in whatever I decided I thought was important, whether that
45:23
was my piano playing, whether that was - I remember he showed up at a random,
45:27
random, this is the type of grandpa I had.
45:29
Just randomly showed up at my football practice, randomly, I mean no reason.
45:33
It wasn’t a special practice, he just showed up, it was like doing laps
45:37
around the Grant Bowl while I had practice and then he’d just talk to me
45:41
afterwards “oh, I just wanted to come down and see how the program was doing.”
45:43
Ah, okay [laughs]
45:44
. Alright [laughs]
45:45
. That’s so dad, that’s so dad [laughs]
45:47
. Yeah, he’s like.
45:50
That’s so dad.
45:50
“You want a ride home?” “I’m good.” “Alright” [laughs] . Like
45:55
he encouraged whatever I thought.
45:56
I mean, I, I’m a singer/songwriter and he pushed me with that, “what
46:01
are you doing, are you performing, do you plan on performing?”
46:04
Ah, okay.
46:04
“Well if you’re not then I’m not sure how serious you really
46:07
are” - you know what I mean?
46:07
Which was, which was like...
46:09
Yeah.
46:10
But then it was also like alright I mean I get what you’re saying,
46:15
you’re calling me to action.
46:16
Right.
46:17
Yeah, he, he supported just about anything that I did.
46:19
Right.
46:20
The big thing, the biggest thing man, I learned like as far as communicating
46:25
and supporting someone goes is just, he never invalidated my feelings, ever.
46:32
It didn’t matter if I was the child in the situation, it didn’t matter
46:35
if I was just flat out wrong.
46:37
He never invalidated what I was telling him my experience was,
46:41
whether that was with struggling with academics or struggling with
46:46
a way of understanding something.
46:47
Whether that was a situation that happened within the household,
46:50
whether it was, I mean anything.
46:52
He never, he always like my mother, he listened, he, and I
46:56
mean he didn’t invalidate me.
46:57
What I mean by that is that often times as older folks, as adults, especially
47:02
when talking to those of the younger generation of just younger age, less
47:06
experience, we invalidate without even thinking about it, the youth’s
47:12
experience, which is the easiest way to end a conversation with somebody and to
47:16
get, you know, a younger person to revolt against you, but he never did that on me.
47:21
And like I said, I was flat out wrong a lot of the time, but he never invalidated,
47:25
he never was like, “I’m not listening to that because that’s not, that’s not
47:30
correct.” He would just let me go and the crazy thing was, in doing that not
47:36
only did I feel like, like I mattered, my opinion mattered, my voice mattered, but I
47:40
found what was actually right [laughs] by just saying the wrong things so many times
47:47
I started to actually hear myself go, “oh, huh” [laughs] and then, you know, and so.
47:53
That’s great.
47:54
That was, that was big.
47:54
Yeah
47:54
He, he was just supportive with everything I did.
47:56
Right.
47:57
He was, yeah.
47:59
Yeah.
47:59
He, he would complement you once [laughs] and then tell you the 20
48:05
things that you need to work on [laughs]
48:06
. Right, yes.
48:08
But that one compliment was so sweet, it was like, ah there it
48:11
is [laughs] . Like there’s the redeeming quality [laughs] you got it.
48:16
That’s great to hear, yeah.
48:18
Yeah.
48:18
Loretta, can I come back and ask you a little bit about the
48:20
transition between leaving here and going to Idaho to play ball.
48:24
How did that, how did that negotiation take place around him keeping the,
48:27
getting that scholarship and you know, the, the, the decision to, to leave?
48:33
Yeah.
48:34
Can you talk a little about that?
48:34
I think that actually Dee Andros helped with that.
48:38
Okay.
48:38
That whole process, yeah.
48:40
Yeah,
48:43
so there must have been conversation between the Utah
48:46
coach and, and Dee Andros and yeah.
48:53
Right.
48:53
Can I say one more thing?
48:55
Please.
48:55
Dovetailing with Isaiah.
48:57
Sure, sure.
49:00
Fred was so multifaceted, he; I mean he was an environmentalist.
49:07
The man loved trees.
49:08
He just loved [laughs] , he loved trees [laughs]
49:12
. The man loved his trees [laughs]
49:14
. He just loved being in the outdoors and hiking and I have pictures
49:17
of him hiking with his backpack.
49:20
We, we went on these long hikes all over.
49:23
And he loved, you know, in particular, trees, Redwoods, oh my gosh.
49:30
Yeah.
49:30
The Redwoods, the California Redwoods that was his, he loved those - hummingbirds,
49:39
hummingbirds.
49:40
Yeah,
49:43
so I just wanted to add that.
49:46
Oh thanks for adding that, yeah.
49:46
Mind you, he’s doing these hikes with walking sticks that he made.
49:49
Oh, he has.
49:50
It’s like, like sir, [laughs] sir what, what are you, what?!
49:54
[laughs]
49:55
. Yeah, he’s got his walking sticks, he made like six of them.
49:58
I would say he made and he wrapped, he made a handle out
50:00
of a deconstructed volleyball.
50:02
Okay.
50:02
That he just turned inside out and wrapped it around so it was a very soft grip.
50:05
Ah okay.
50:05
Showed me how to skin, I mean it was just like, who are you?
50:09
[laughs]
50:10
That’s grandpa, that’s, that’s Grandpa Monroe, that’s.
50:11
That’s.
50:12
That’s who that is, that’s that he, my dad would go out and like, “I’m
50:17
going to redo the steps on the deck.”
50:20
[laughs] what?
50:20
And like pull them out and redesign them and then forgot how to level them,
50:24
like he would do all these projects.
50:25
Meanwhile, this is the same guy.
50:26
My mom has the front of the house, it’s so beautiful and mystique and my
50:29
dad has the back, it’s got projects everywhere, but, but that’s, you ask
50:33
me about how he was like his dad and that he loved a good problem to solve.
50:39
Right.
50:39
He loved an intellectual problem; he loved an engineering problem like
50:43
he loved a good problem to solve.
50:45
And I was just going to say like when I was little, the athletic piece,
50:48
he, that’s when I said that’s so Dad.
50:51
Just showed up [laughs]
50:52
. Just showed up and like walked around like surveilling the scene and he, I
50:56
was a runner when he was younger and he, you know, was my coach and he’d
51:00
have me out there and like, you know.
51:04
I remember him saying I had to run, I’d be able to run two miles and catch my
51:08
breath within two minutes and then he would be like, “okay now you’re ready for
51:13
like,” he was, he was serious about his, his athletics right? But he was always
51:19
there, you’d look up and he was always there, you knew mom was there because she
51:25
has a very particular high pitch scream.
51:27
Yeah, she does!
51:29
[laughs] because you know, we got to have that too.
51:32
Have the, the encouragement.
51:33
Yelling for you.
51:34
Yeah, all events.
51:37
Absolutely.
51:37
Yes, events of all sorts.
51:39
But he was, he, he believed in sports to his core, like he believed that that
51:43
discipline and that working harder than you knew you could work, that, that
51:49
following through on a goal, that besting yourself when you’re anxious about,
51:53
you know, your own like that was so core to him and I, I knew it because I
51:58
experienced it in, in him being my coach and in various ways and I meant it when
52:02
I said that he became a volleyball coach.
52:04
He didn’t know anything about volleyball, but I wanted to
52:06
play, my sister wanted to play.
52:07
Didn’t, didn’t he help found, found like, like found the PIL?
52:09
Yeah he founded the PIL.
52:10
Founded the PIL, he was actually one of the founders [laughs]
52:13
Ah, okay.
52:13
Yeah, yeah.
52:14
PIL sports club.
52:14
Well yeah, he founded his own club...
52:16
Right.
52:16
And figured that out and became like to Mom’s point, he was very
52:19
multifaceted, a student of whatever, so became a volleyball coach because
52:23
that was, but what he cared about was the development of human beings.
52:27
Like that is always, if you ask anybody who’s ever been coached by him or mentored
52:31
by him or whatever, he cared about your development as a person and that was, it
52:36
was just so core and, and central to him.
52:40
I want to revisit what you had asked me, just about, you know, with the
52:43
sports and whether he ever pushed.
52:44
I think by far, you know, kind of along with just that be multifaceted, be open
52:51
to everybody and it was his biggest thing for me including that, you know, setting
52:56
goals was to be a player of everything.
52:58
Okay.
52:59
Whether that was through that was politics, whether that was room that I was
53:02
sitting in, whether that was the friends that were around me, whether that was
53:04
the color of my skin, whether that was what I actually thought in a situation as
53:09
opposed to what everybody else thought.
53:10
His biggest thing for me was to be aware and to be aware of self and
53:14
where you stand and, and look at all of that and then analyze it, which
53:18
I think is a lot of what I do now and I think it was in me already,
53:22
but he kind of, he brought it out.
53:23
I mean, he, he would sit me down and already have blocked out news
53:28
columns that he had already decided I was going to read [laughs]
53:31
. Okay, okay.
53:32
Sit me down and make me read them and they would be, I mean they would
53:35
be about laws that pertain to me.
53:36
It was, I can’t remember which measure it was, but it was, it was the one
53:39
talking about if you’re over the age of 15 years old and you’re with
53:43
a friend and they get caught shop lifting, you can actually be taken as
53:46
well just because you knew about it.
53:48
Things that I didn’t know about, but affected me, you know what I mean?
53:52
So he, he was, his biggest thing was just be aware, be smart, be
53:56
knowledgeable, don’t ever, don’t take things for face value, look
54:00
into it, research, like really, really be aware of what’s going on.
54:04
Politics was a big thing for him; obviously he ran
54:06
for city council or was it?
54:09
Yes, city council and county commissioner.
54:11
Right and it’s like, same guy who makes walking sticks, [laughs] but
54:17
yeah his biggest thing, was just be aware, being aware was such
54:20
a thing that I remember from him because I was in the clouds a lot.
54:25
I was a dreamer, I was you know, happy-go-lucky -one
54:28
thing, next thing, other thing.
54:30
His big thing, you know, was “be aware, what are you looking at, what’s
54:33
facing you, what’s going on right now?”
54:35
Right.
54:36
“Are you paying attention to politics, these are the things that are going to
54:38
affect you, yeah they’re happening today and you’re 12 years old, but these are
54:42
the things that are going to affect you when you’re 25, when you’re 30, when
54:44
you want to start buying a house, do you know, I mean are you, just pay attention”
54:47
- he didn’t ask me to vote [laughs]
54:49
. Right.
54:49
But he was like just know what’s going on.
54:51
Right, right.
54:52
And you reminded me of that when you were just talking about, one, him being
54:56
there and the sports thing I remember even with that it was just being
54:59
aware, you know, or taking the bus, be aware [laughs] . Who are you with?
55:03
Be aware and it doesn’t mean to remove yourself, it just means if you need
55:08
to, at least be aware of the fact that you know, maybe I should just
55:11
like backpedal out of this because it’s going to end up pretty bad for
55:14
me like backpedal out of this [laughs]
55:16
. [?] yeah.
55:18
After leaving football then, Loretta, did he never want to get back into it
55:22
again, in other words could he finish his career I understand, the Alouettes,
55:26
did he never look back and say oh I want to be a coach or, you know, I’m going to
55:30
pursue this any other way, do you recall?
55:32
Well actually, he did coach when my son, our third child.
55:37
Ah, okay.
55:39
He, he attended Central Catholic High School in Portland and Fred became one
55:46
of their assistant coaches on their football team and so he, he worked and at
55:55
training the, the linebackers, I think.
55:57
That’s his position, yeah.
55:58
Yeah, some of the defensive positions, he, he worked with the kids and
56:07
with my son and yeah that was.
56:12
Did the other coaches...
56:13
His.
56:13
Did the other coaches know his reputation meaning?
56:15
I think so.
56:16
What happened here?
56:17
I think so.
56:18
All that he did?
56:18
Yeah, I think so.
56:20
That’s probably why he was allowed to be an assistance coach [laughs]
56:23
. Yeah, he also coached track there, he coached, did some track.
56:28
Did he really?
56:28
Yeah because Fred was a track star also.
56:31
Well can you tell us about that?
56:32
Oh the shot put, yeah the shot put.
56:34
Shot put champion.
56:36
That’s right.
56:36
Of the state of Washington, he was shot put, he, he wrestler, he
56:42
was also a wrestler and he, he...
56:44
Oh man.
56:44
He, he, I think he was one of the championship wrestlers at,
56:52
at the state of Washington.
56:55
Right, at the state
56:57
yeah.
56:58
But...
56:58
But he would never tell you that.
57:00
No he never did [laughs] . I mean he just wanted to rebuild his backyard
57:05
[laughs] . You know what I mean?
57:05
Right.
57:05
He didn’t really care about letting you know.
57:07
Right.
57:07
I want to say something pertaining to football.
57:10
I think that he played football, you know, beginning at a young age,
57:17
he was a middle linebacker, punishing, he was, he was called “Freight Train.”
57:25
Freight Train!
57:26
That was his nickname in, in at Richland High School.
57:30
Okay.
57:30
He was a big dude.
57:31
Freight Train.
57:33
I think that in his later years, his football playing really did impact his
57:39
health, he ended up with ruptured discs in his back which, you know, he had three
57:48
back operations and then yeah and I think, I think just the sum of what happened to
57:58
his, his mental health later in life also.
58:02
I think football, playing football [smacking hands noise]
58:07
. Concussions and so forth right?
58:09
There’s been a lot of news about that lately.
58:12
Yeah.
58:12
Yeah.
58:13
Yeah.
58:13
So...
58:15
That’s tough, yeah.
58:16
Well we’re going to end off the interview by saying is there anything you’d like
58:19
to tell us about Fred, your, your dad or your grandfather or that we’ve missed
58:23
or you want to really get on the record?
58:26
I just want to make it clear; he was the best person ever
58:30
[laughs] . If that wasn’t already clear [laughs]
58:31
. Sure sounds that way.
58:31
Just you know, let me put it in black and white.
58:34
Okay.
58:34
He was the best person ever [laughs]
58:36
. Not perfect so much, but...
58:38
Sure.
58:38
Yeah, I’m trying to think what he would.
58:41
Yeah what would he like to leave us with?
58:42
Like what he would want.
58:43
Can I start that out?
58:46
People to know, huh?
58:48
Can I start that out?
58:48
What he would want people to know?
58:49
Yeah.
58:49
[laughs]
58:53
the first thing he would say is that it’s not about me [laughs] . I mean
58:57
really, I think his biggest, I mean if he was here, his biggest thing
59:00
would be, “alright what’s next?” and “how can I get that started?”
59:06
And I think that’s my piece of it.
59:10
Is just with everything that he was able to do, “what’s next, what are we
59:15
going to do?” You know, we’ve all had the opportunity whether it was through
59:19
interview, whether it was through fatherhood, marriage, being a grandfather.
59:24
We’ve all had interactions with him, we’ve all seen what an amazing
59:30
person looks like, we got that down, so now what are we going to do?
59:41
Oh, I was going to say that I think that,
59:46
the woman who’s heading up the
59:51
Educational Opportunities.
59:52
EOP?
59:52
EOP
59:53
Janet Nishihara?
59:54
Yes.
59:55
Yes.
59:56
She mentioned to me that what happened on campus in ‘69 was one of the things
1:00:04
that spearheaded the founding of the EOP, which, you know, the ball got rolling
1:00:12
and eventually this facility was built.
1:00:15
You got it.
1:00:15
So it’s a testament to, you know, not only Fred’s, Fred’s part in that
1:00:23
movement, but all the other people that were a part of it that their,
1:00:29
their, their efforts and their strength, is bearing fruit, you know?
1:00:35
Absolutely, I’m here because Fred’s here and I’ll connect myself to Fred because
1:00:40
I got hired here as a diversity hire and the only reason why I got hired as a
1:00:44
diversity hire is because of the things that Fred and people subsequent to Fred
1:00:49
talked about on this campus, is lacking role models, people who are actually,
1:00:53
you know, here for students of color.
1:00:55
And so I definitely connect myself to those pioneers that were on campus.
1:01:02
I was going to say almost the exact same thing, like he would.
1:01:06
What’s next?
1:01:08
Well yes, but the first thing is that he said, “Well, it’s not about me.”
1:01:11
Like I think that’s very much his, and he would, it would make him so
1:01:16
much prouder and happier to know that there are things like the EO, EOC,
1:01:21
and diversity, like that would make him really proud I think, but yeah.
1:01:31
I, it’s a little bit, it’s sort of about that, it’s sort of about me
1:01:36
[laughs] . I was sharing with you that I read a book, looked at a book and
1:01:40
it was about OSU football and there was no mention and how much that was
1:01:47
really powerful for me, how easy it is to erase something from existence.
1:01:52
And I think that, is the part that’s important, would be important to Dad,
1:01:57
like not his name necessarily although that’s important to us, like he was big
1:02:01
and important in that time period and I’m, I’m glad that people understand
1:02:06
that, but that, that story not get co-opted, like I’ve also heard other
1:02:10
stories of, “oh well, you know it was the Panthers who were about this and
1:02:13
about that” and its, it was not, it was not. So, so the integrity of the story,
1:02:22
if you’re going to tell the story, tell the story, it would matter to him, I
1:02:27
believe, with integrity and fidelity.
1:02:32
Let’s see looking back at the picture back there just, was reflecting and thinking
1:02:36
did they ever get a reunion going with the men who were part of the walkout or?
1:02:39
Get, get a what?
1:02:41
A reunion or a...
1:02:42
Oh, you mean like right now?
1:02:42
Or like people getting together or anything or people?
1:02:47
I don’t think so.
1:02:47
Ever?
1:02:47
I don’t think so.
1:02:47
No, yeah.
1:02:50
Yeah.
1:02:50
Yeah, that’s a shame.
1:02:51
I have to say that my dad would also want to say that my mom is.
1:02:57
Yeah I was going to say that [laughs]
1:03:00
. So...
1:03:00
Yeah he could not have done... [laughs]
1:03:01
Have heard this part of the story that you highlighted, that whoo, then we
1:03:04
moved here and then we moved here.
1:03:06
Right, like wait a second!
1:03:06
[laughs]
1:03:06
. Here then we got fired from this job and then we moved here [laughs]
1:03:11
. We just kept on trucking [laughs]
1:03:13
. That is not, none of that is easy and, and dad knew that.
1:03:19
Especially when you take in the circumstances...
1:03:20
And he would say like, none of that, none of everything that happened is
1:03:24
possible without you, like he knew that, he knew that, even though, you know,
1:03:30
he didn’t always, it came out, when it came out, it came out when I was being
1:03:33
obnoxious as a teenager and he was like, “You will not - because your mother”
1:03:39
[laughs] . Let me explain.
1:03:41
The thing that held us together was respect, we just really
1:03:45
respected each other, you know.
1:03:48
You kind of have to, ya’ll two are pretty respectable [laughs]
1:03:55
. Well we’re going to turn the tape and go around now and say...
1:03:56
Thanks
1:03:56
And say thank you very much to both of you, not both of you, all
1:03:58
three of you for being part of this contribution to the archives...
1:04:03
Thank you
1:04:03
Thank you, thank you
1:04:03
Thank you so much
1:04:03
Thank you for keeping the story alive.
1:04:04
Thanks.
