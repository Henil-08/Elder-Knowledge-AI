00:01
So, I asked to start with uh, some of the community aspects.
00:07
What are some of the ways that the center interacts with the
00:09
local community of Corvallis?
00:11
Well, that’s a great question.
00:13
So we interact with the local community, in a couple of different ways.
00:16
So, one way that we interact with our community is within our BCC
00:22
and all of our cultural centers we have advisory councils, right?
00:26
And so, our advisory councils of course are made up of professional staff in
00:31
the centers, as well as students who represent that affinity group, but
00:36
we also have spaces on the council, on the advisory council, for members
00:41
of the community to participate.
00:45
They, the structure of the advisory council does not allow any type of
00:52
voting structure if you will, but instead we do really rely heavily on our
00:58
community partners to sort of serve as the advisors, coaches, and to helps us
01:04
really make the best decisions regarding programing, events, and things like that.
01:10
Uh huh.
01:10
Yeah, that’s one way.
01:12
Okay, so one of the things I noticed when I was doing research on this, is
01:15
that one of the assisting coordinators for the cultural center in 1991, he said
01:20
that while it had original been formed in 1975 partially due to a lot of the
01:24
racial harassment and insensitivity.
01:26
Uh huh.
01:26
Over time, the students and body sort of increased, and a number of
01:30
minority students increased, there been more a trend towards diversity
01:34
sort of explaining to people what the cultural center was about.
01:37
I know that’s one of the big focuses now.
01:39
So, do you feel like that’s sort of a permanent trend that as the student body
01:44
increases, is there a way to sort of keep a balance between like providing
01:49
the safe haven and sort of comfortable home for students and still sort of
01:56
reaching out to all the different groups?
01:59
Yeah, most certainly.
02:00
Um, and so you used the word, uh, um, a “minority” which is a word that is
02:06
often, often used when describing these types of, of organizations, groups,
02:13
affinity-based groups, culturally-based groups that, that we work with.
02:17
So what we are wanting to introduce and offer to, to, to everyone is, to
02:24
really try to look at, at reframing the word “minority” and really use
02:31
the word “emerging” - and so we are an emerging population, right?
02:35
And when we say emerging we mean that, but because
02:40
the numbers have shown, the census, the numbers in terms of number of population
02:44
indicators show that one day the minoritized group, or underrepresented
02:49
group, will become the majority.
02:50
Right.
02:51
And so the majority would in essence become the minority, and so we are
02:54
liking, so we would like to use the word “emerging group.” And so to answer
02:58
your questions, I do see opportunities for emerging groups as well as the
03:04
current majority groups to live in a world and be a part of the community,
03:12
this OSU community, that is much more collaborative, cohesive, and I think it
03:17
would
03:20
do a really good job to help create that by clearly stating and
03:25
communicating that all of these spaces are open for everyone, okay.
03:31
It is important because we are coming from a marginalized community
03:36
or an underrepresented population, especially here in the Pacific North.
03:40
Right.
03:41
That we that we honor, okay, and we continue to provide opportunities for
03:49
everyone to learn about everyone’s different cultures and how their cultures
03:54
have really impacted society, how it impacts our community, and so we like
04:01
to say that while these affinity-based groups and organizations have centers to
04:10
support that great work, we also want to be clear to everyone that for instance,
04:15
if you go out into the BCC, the Black Cultural Center, the overall agenda,
04:21
if you will, will be a Black or African or African American focused agenda.
04:25
Uh huh.
04:25
That does not meant that we will not have conversations with folk
04:30
who identify as you know, other ways then then Black or of, of, of, of
04:36
African American or, or African.
04:38
However, we do consider these spaces as educational learning labs for everyone
04:44
to learn about the Black agenda, to learn about our Black America, right,
04:49
and to learn how their contributions have played into the larger society.
04:53
So does that answer your question a little bit?
04:54
Yeah.
04:55
Ok, cool.
04:56
So, the center was partly founded out of like some of the racial tension that was…
05:00
Yes!
05:01
Happening then.
05:01
Definitely.
05:02
And incidents like that still happen every once in a while, like there
05:06
was the racist graffiti in the bathrooms and stuff in recent years.
05:09
Yes, yes.
05:10
So how do you feel the role of the center changes during those times
05:13
and how do you respond to those?
05:14
So, that’s great.
05:16
You know the role of our centers definitely changed in those times
05:20
and I’m not quite sure if you recall, but we did experience quite a bit
05:25
of incidents last year, maybe even not on campus, but globally because
05:30
we do live in a global society.
05:31
Right.
05:32
We have a lot of students from all over the globe and so our Office of Diversity
05:38
and Cultural Engagement really worked to and with other administrators and
05:42
faculty and staff and students on campus in the, in the essence where those things
05:48
occur, those unfortunate things occur.
05:51
We are able to transform our centers into these spaces of dialogue, these
05:56
spaces of being in community and we can have a conversation, that guess
06:01
what, it may be uncomfortable okay, as we, as a collective community try to
06:06
troubleshoot and unpack and understand some of these issues that are just not
06:11
fair, not right, and just plain wrong, and so we are very, very responsive.
06:19
We again, we work with all university officials, our marketing teams, our
06:25
faculty and staff, and we quickly and our students, uh and we quickly
06:30
provide opportunities to be in community together and to strategize, okay.
06:35
So a lot of those dialogues often turn to strategizing sessions, okay.
06:39
What’s the problem?
06:40
What are we wanting to do?
06:42
And how are we going to get there?
06:43
Right.
06:44
You know.
06:44
Um, we did a very similar thing when there was an event that happened
06:49
with the white fraternity, sigma SAE,
06:58
in Oklahoma.
07:00
And we worked with the office of fraternity and sorority life
07:03
and the Black Cultural Center to organize a town hall meeting.
07:07
We invited the public, we invited the entire campus, we had about 300 people
07:12
in the, the auditorium at that time, and we had a really good discussion.
07:18
Uh huh.
07:18
And that discussion led to me having an opportunity to go to at least 9 different
07:25
fraternities and sorority houses on Greek road here on campus, well, off
07:29
campus, and have further conversation around diversity, social justice,
07:35
racism, classism, ageism, and sexism.
07:38
And so it really opened up and opportunity for us to kind of take the conversation
07:44
a little deeper, because as you know we are all in different places, the way
07:49
in which we may speak to someone that constantly talks about social justice and
07:54
diversity and racism is very different to the way that I would speak to someone
07:59
that knows absolutely nothing about it.
08:01
Right.
08:01
You know.
08:02
So we do have to provide a curriculum, conversation of point if you will,
08:09
to reach the student, the faculty, or the community partner, where they are.
08:13
And then once we have that relationship established, that’s when we kind
08:16
of dive a little deeper and unpack all the areas of oppression.
08:21
Uh huh.
08:21
So yeah.
08:22
So, you mentioned the incident of Oklahoma.
08:24
So do you guys use, so it’s not, so you use like national
08:30
events to open a dialogue.
08:32
Yeah, yeah, yeah because again, OSU is just not Corvallis, so
08:37
you could probably tell by my accent, I’m from North Carolina.
08:39
Right.
08:39
You know, so I’m from the East coast, from the southern states, and racism,
08:44
classism, social justice is completely different in that part of the country.
08:50
And so imagine just from the East coast to the West coast if there is
08:53
differences, imagine how it is from someone who may live, like let’s
08:57
say in, I don’t know, Saudi Arabia?
09:01
You know, or China…
09:03
Right.
09:03
Or Afghanistan or Korea, you know?
09:06
And so we have to constantly be in community.
09:09
We have to create opportunities for everyone to understand, okay, again
09:14
everything is different, everyone is different and there is awesomeness, and
09:19
coolness and greatness in everything, and we appreciate that, but how can we
09:24
together help everyone understand where we are at this current time and this current
09:30
city of Corvallis, okay, while at the same time, appreciating and very knowledgeable
09:36
about our many differences, right.
09:38
Right.
09:38
For instance, I may say a word here, a word may be used one way on the
09:42
east coast, but maybe used completely different in the Midwest, and the
09:47
completely different in the West coast, and then that word may not
09:49
even have any meaning in different countries, and you know, in the world.
09:53
And so it’s a lot of conversation and so that’s why we are, we love to have
09:57
dialogues; we love to be in community because that’s really how we learn.
10:01
And unfortunately we don’t learn everything in those spaces at all
10:04
times, but I think that is our charge.
10:06
To continue to be in community, ask questions, and ask questions from this
10:11
place of really wanting to learn, right.
10:15
Really being sincere, you know.
10:18
This is what I’m struggling with.
10:19
This is what I do not understand.
10:21
Could you please help me, educate me on this?
10:24
What does this mean?
10:26
You know, yeah.
10:28
So, how do you see the center changing in the foreseeable future?
10:32
Oh, that’s a great question.
10:33
So I see our centers changing quite vastly.
10:37
As you know, you know, we have four, renovised, or not renovised, but four
10:44
centers that we kind of - we are so fortunate enough to receive some, some,
10:50
some funding from our capital campaign here, thanks to president Ed Ray and
10:55
the board of trustees, and we do see our
11:02
centers expanding.
11:04
We see that these spaces are becoming spaces that are much
11:11
more welcoming to all people.
11:15
I personally have received a lot of thank you emails, a lot of ‘hey you know
11:21
I do feel safe in this Black Cultural Center because I may identify as
11:25
White.’ ‘I do not feel as if everyone is looking at me and judging me’ - right.
11:30
Which is good, which is good because this is an institution of higher learning
11:36
and that’s what college is all about.
11:37
It’s about learning and it’s about building relationships.
11:42
I also want to go on record saying that you will also notice that for instance in
11:48
our different centers that not everyone identifies as that particular center’s
11:54
affinity group or not everyone has some of those same social identities.
11:59
So you do not have to be or identify as female or a woman
12:04
to work in the Women’s Center.
12:05
You do not have to identify as LGBTQ person to work at our Pride Center.
12:10
You do not have to identify as a Black or African or African American
12:13
to work in the Black Cultural Center.
12:16
And so we encourage everyone to go and look at the setup of our centers.
12:22
Look at the staff, okay.
12:25
I personally have five student staff members that work directly for me, right.
12:32
And they are, they all have so many different identities, right.
12:37
So they are not all folk who identify as European, they are not
12:41
all heterosexual, I mean I have the gambit, I sought to hire students
12:46
that best reflect that work that I do.
12:49
Right.
12:49
Yeah, so really kind of like tearing down those barriers and creating safe spaces
12:54
for everyone, but clearly knowing that, that while doing that the agenda, the
13:01
overall programming mechanisms, the events may cater or may really feature the,
13:09
you know, the particular affinity group.
13:11
Right.
13:11
Yeah.
13:13
So what do the renovated centers, what do they sort of, what do they mean to you?
13:18
Like what do you think they allow you to do now?
13:20
Oh, that’s a great question.
13:21
I think the renovated centers, first of all, they allow us to,
13:25
to provide an additional point of pride for Oregon State University.
13:29
Oregon State University has so many points of, of pride.
13:32
And I’m just so happy that we can offer up and tangibly demonstrate
13:36
our commitment toward diversity.
13:40
You know Christopher, there’s a lot of people talking about this work all
13:43
across the country and I can tell you they talk, ‘oh well you know we are all
13:45
about diversity, we embrace diversity, we embrace social justice’ but Oregon
13:49
State University we are the only, and I repeat the only university, okay, as far
13:57
as I know, in the whole world, but I’m going to say in the states, that have
14:02
not just one, not just two, but seven different cultural and resource centers.
14:08
Not just seven different cultural and resource centers, but this very
14:11
office that you are in, this is another office that supports that.
14:15
So I’d like to say that we are a well and front of the eight ball if you will,
14:20
around really knowing how important and embracing how important diversity is and
14:27
creating good and solid infrastructure to demonstrate our commitment.
14:33
You know, and so, the exposure the employment opportunities for students,
14:40
the opportunities for faculty and staff to, to come to these centers
14:44
and to conduct research with students.
14:48
Of course we have some funding to host and collaborate around programing and events.
14:56
We have state of the art equipment in these spaces.
14:56
And we even have opportunities now to have barbeques, tailgaters, tailgating events.
14:59
And
15:11
so yeah, I think, you know, the sky is the limit for us here within
15:16
our cultural resource centers.
15:18
We’re so appreciative of Oregon State University because this is not common.
15:22
And again coming from the East coast, from the South where, you know, social
15:28
justice and diversity is really different.
15:33
I am so fortunate, every day I am so grateful to, to be a part of this team
15:38
and to be a part of the Oregon, the Oregon State University community.
15:43
What part of working in the centers do you enjoy the most?
15:47
Oh, that’s a good question.
15:50
I will be telling you, not the truth if I was to say that sometimes politics do
15:55
not get involved because they do, right?
15:57
You have to battle the bureaucracy, right?
16:00
Of just, systems.
16:02
And then with cultural awareness, right?
16:10
It is very difficult for us to do that at times because there is some
16:14
mandates, policies, that regardless of how you identify as a university
16:21
that we must adhere to, we get that.
16:24
However, coming from a cultural lens, there’s somethings, in
16:29
terms of bureaucracy and these systems of oppression that just
16:33
do not align with our values.
16:35
So that is a difficult thing that I have to navigate and I have to navigate
16:39
every day, and unfortunately I don’t have the blueprint, to say, “okay Jason
16:43
do x y and z in this, in this particular order” but one of the highlights, is
16:48
for me, is to know that we have a great supportive team, I have a great supportive
16:53
professional team that I work with.
16:55
I also have awesome students, that challenge me,
17:01
that keeps the mission and the vision always current in my, in,
17:07
in the forefront of my thinking,
17:12
and it’s, I appreciate this space has been very open to change and very adaptive
17:20
to the new Oregon State University, you know, very adaptive to the 21st century.
17:27
Right.
17:30
So speaking sort of I guess, sort of experience it like race in Oregon State,
17:38
there haven’t been, at least as far as I could find, boycotts since 19,
17:42
I think it was 1996, as far as, dealing with racial harassment
17:47
and the like, but obviously with the bathroom issues and stuff.
17:52
There is still, like, I mean that’s still a present issue on campus, do you think
17:57
that it gets enough attention or that it is somewhat underestimated today?
18:02
You know, so that’s a good question.
18:04
And attention, I don’t know if that’s the word I would use, you know.
18:11
Do things like this get enough attention?
18:13
I think that like anything, there needs to be somewhat a plan of action,
18:24
and people that are affected by these issues of hate and social justice,
18:33
or just injustices in general.
18:35
I think the leadership needs to come from those particular affinity-based groups
18:44
or social identifying groups that are in the struggle and are directly impacted
18:51
by these things, allow those groups to create a plan, okay, a very strategic
19:00
plan of action and then move forward.
19:03
Because if our immediate instinct is to have a march, have a boycott,
19:11
have a protest, and we are not well educated on the issues, on the
19:17
ramifications, on the truth, the facts.
19:21
It tends to sound like a whole bunch of noise, and nothing will get done.
19:25
And so I think that
19:31
the communities that once again are most affected, effected
19:35
excuse me, by it and impacted.
19:37
I think that the opportunity and the leadership if you will, really lends,
19:42
starts there, to strategize and then other folk could come in, and to
19:48
support and to stand in solidarity.
19:52
Yeah and so that’s really what has been happening for quite some time now, and
19:58
I’m glad because sometimes, Christopher, if folk are just chanting and marching,
20:05
and doing stuff and there’s no real end goal in mind, it starts to become kind
20:12
of, it sounds as if... You know people are like, so what is this all about?
20:17
You know?
20:18
And so you have to provide that framework and that, summon that
20:21
structure and that plan of action
20:26
to really effectively communicate what it is that you are
20:29
protesting or marching about.
20:30
Cause if not, nothing will ever happen.
20:34
Yeah, so that’s my take on it, that’s my personal opinion on it.
20:36
Yeah, okay.
20:38
So, I have some questions.
20:40
Yeah.
20:40
From the oral history project, so.
20:43
Okay.
20:43
If you don’t want to get in to them.
20:44
I don’t know how much time you have left.
20:45
Yeah, I think I have a couple more minutes, like five more minutes.
20:48
Ok, so
20:51
what has been your challenges working, what are some of the challenges you had
20:55
working at the, with the cultural centers?
20:57
And how have you dealt with them?
20:59
Yeah, that’s a great question, so uh, currently, right now, we have on boarded
21:07
quite a bit of professional staff, okay.
21:10
And prior to this 2015, prior to
21:17
2013, these centers were really operated, totally facilitated
21:21
operated and managed by students.
21:24
Which was great, loved it.
21:26
However, uh there was some things that, that we could have done a little better.
21:34
And so ushering one of the largest challenges, challenges from my
21:39
limited perspective now of being here, has really been, how do we
21:47
embrace and lean into change, right.
21:52
Like I said earlier, I have been here for a year and a couple
21:54
months, and I have worked at other institutions besides OSU, right.
22:01
And so, how can some of my ideas, some of my team member’s ideas,
22:06
how can we infuse some of our ideas with the current ideas that are here
22:14
and with the older ideas, right.
22:16
And so how can we scale it up, how can we move from good to great?
22:19
That has been somewhat of a challenge because we have people who have
22:23
been a part of these communities, rather in the capacity of an advisor
22:27
member or some capacity that has years and years and years of history.
22:33
Well this is 2015, this isn’t 1996 anymore, this isn’t 1965.
22:39
So, how do we say that in a graceful way, in a way in which no one feels as if,
22:44
“oh you know he’s changing everything, messing everything up.” No, not messing
22:48
everything up, we are just, we, we’re trying to accommodate our ever changing
22:53
students. And we need some grace on both hands, and if we are doing things,
22:58
too much change, let’s talk about that.
23:01
Just don’t, write us off or say, “oh you guys are idiots,” you know, or “you
23:05
folk are idiots,” no lets, let’s be in community, let’s have a conversation.
23:10
Yeah, so that’s been one of, one of the challenges: embracing change.
23:18
So what projects or events or activities would you like to see or
23:22
would you recommend in the future?
23:23
So one opportunity that we are hoping to embrace in the future
23:31
is an opportunity for definitely to continue to be in community, an
23:35
opportunity to fundraise, right.
23:39
And fundraise in a way in which it doesn’t like make our affinity based
23:46
groups our social identified groups feel marginalized in anyway, but
23:52
how can we provide opportunities for potential donors to give to our causes.
24:01
To financially support our programs and even if you can’t
24:05
support us financially, how can we further engage community members?
24:09
And stakeholder of all kinds?
24:12
And how can we create opportunities for them to see themselves within
24:17
these centers and make it a positive impact on our students?
24:20
So that’s one thing that we are really going to be ramping up this year.
24:25
Another opportunity that we see within our centers is that often times folk
24:32
forget that we are all made up of so many different identities, so many
24:37
different social identities, right.
24:39
So how can we sort of debunk some of those myths around, “oh well all Black people
24:44
play basketball” – actually, they don’t.
24:46
“All, all people of color like Hip hop music”- actually, they don’t.
24:49
And you are talking to one, I don’t even really like, I don’t know a lot
24:52
about the Hip hop music, you know?
24:54
I know a lot of students who know about it, you know.
24:56
I, I love the Dave Mathews Band and some people tell me, “oh Jason you’re
25:00
old” - well I love Dave Mathews Band, you know that’s just what I like to do.
25:03
So, how can we really create opportunities for all of our, many and multiples and
25:10
intersecting identities to kind of come to the forefront and to be a little bit more
25:15
salient, you know, and so not just basing your, or not just having stereotypes about
25:21
someone because of how they look, you know, their outer appearance they may be
25:25
of color, they may be whatever, right?
25:28
Yeah, so those are two things.
25:32
What is one takeaway you have from working with the cultural centers
25:36
that you would share with others?
25:37
I
25:39
would say one takeaway would be to ask questions, okay.
25:47
Always ask questions, and I would say
25:55
we wish that you, we wish that all of our visitors staff, colleagues,
26:01
administrators, community members feel welcome in these spaces.
26:06
And I think we do a really good job, we could do better, I think we are moving
26:10
toward that path, but I think we do a pretty good job with making sure that
26:15
everyone feels welcome in these spaces.
26:17
And so, we would encourage folk not to shy away from these
26:20
spaces, but embrace the spaces.
26:23
All of our spaces are operated and financed by student fees, so
26:30
every student fee, uh pays some contribu, contributes to some bill
26:35
in the centers, so why not use them?
26:37
Right.
26:38
You know.
26:39
And so yeah, you know, like, like give it a shot - the students and the staff are
26:45
really nice in the spaces, and we are, and actually we know that as we continue to
26:55
really welcome visitors, welcome folk who don’t look like us to these spaces that
27:00
we will see the change in which we want to see here at Oregon State University.
27:06
Okay, thank you.
27:09
Could you just sign the release form?
27:10

28:08

28:10
