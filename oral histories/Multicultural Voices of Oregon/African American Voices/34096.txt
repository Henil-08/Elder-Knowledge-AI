00:02
Let’s start with your early years.
00:07
Where were you born and in what year were you born?
00:10
I was
00:14
born in 1944.
00:16
I was born in Meridian, Mississippi.
00:19
My father was a minister and my mother was a teacher she taught school.
00:28
I’m going to go back a
00:35
little.
00:36
My grandmother was born in slavery and so she and her husband were
00:42
committed to sending my mother to college with the idea of teaching other
00:47
African Americans how to read.
00:50
That was the biggest thing.
00:52
So my mother became a teacher and she got married and started having started
00:57
having a family later in life and after she started having a family she
01:01
stopped teaching and raised her kids.
01:05
In addition to that
01:09
my grandparents were
01:12
old so they became
01:17
in and not any her siblings her home.
01:19
So the two of them were home along and she moved us back.
01:23
I had three brothers and she moved us back to take care of them.
01:28
So that’s when I got a chance to meet and spent time with my grandparents.
01:34
Although they were elderly
01:38
at the time.
01:39
Late 80s
01:42
when they passed away.
01:43
But that’s kind of how it started.
01:46
But they passed
01:50
then we moved my father and as a minister in the south you had a church
01:57
for maybe two to three years and then you moved so we moved all over; not
02:01
only Mississippi but also Alabama.
02:04
A lot of different places.
02:06
Until late 59’ I had a cousin that
02:16
my mother raised.
02:16
He, he thought he saved his life, but anyways he was real sick
02:28
and his mother, my mother’s sister, my
02:32
mother she used to teach but she was also a jazz pianist, so
02:37
my mother brought them back to meridian and cared for
02:43
them and finally
02:48
he
02:52
started to get better.
02:52
So he was in the Korean conflict in the army air corps.
02:54
He
02:56
was discharged in Washington and he
03:01
really wanted to move out to Washington.
03:04
So my mother and two of us moved out to Washington.
03:14
That’s where I ended up fining up high school and started college.
03:18
So that’s kind of my background.
03:20
Was that challenging at the
03:26
young age moving to the different locations?
03:29
No it wasn’t.
03:32
It was different.
03:35
You know a lot of areas were
03:41
not very good places to grow up.
03:43
Meridian was probably one of the best places.
03:46
It was a community of professionals.
03:50
The city was divided by the black community.
03:51
There were a lot of
04:00
black professionals and black businesses.
04:05
I worked when I was young.
04:08
So there were people who owned the restaurant that I worked for on the
04:12
weekend and taught me how to do things.
04:16
Those people kind of adopted me in a way.
04:18
They lived
04:21
about three blocks away from me.
04:23
Saturday mornings we
04:25
would go have breakfast at their house.
04:27
Then get a cab and go to their restaurant and stay there
04:33
all day.
04:34
I learned a lot by moving different places.
04:39
Tuscaloosa Alabama, Duckport
04:45
was one of the places.
04:47
Of course Meridian was one of the places.
04:52
I didn’t move too much because of
04:57
my grandparents.
04:57
So I started school
05:01
and stayed there until about seventh grade.
05:04
Then moved to Bellingham
05:07
You mentioned that you lived with your grandparents
05:12
when they were ill.
05:13
Did you have the opportunity
05:17
to get stories from them and to learn some of their experiences?
05:25
Yes.
05:26
I was the youngest brother, the youngest sibling And before I
05:30
started going to school I would hang out with my grandfather.
05:35
My grandmother and grandfather went to different churches but they
05:37
were only about two blocks apart.
05:39
So my grandmother was a Methodist and my grandfather was a Baptist so
05:39
I went to church with my grandfather.
05:46
It was a different church that I wanted to experience.
05:50
Although he was
05:54
getting old he did odd jobs so every once in a while I would tag along with him to
06:00
do a job so I knew him quite a bit better.
06:01
I learned a lot from him, not alot about his family but a lot about him.
06:07
He didn’t talk a lot about his family.
06:10
My grandmother's family was close.
06:13
She had a brother that lived across the back.
06:17
A little ditch between our homes, he lived back there.
06:22
We had cousins all over.
06:24
There were a lot
06:33
of children.
06:35
It was great the community was great.
06:37
I belonged to a community.
06:39
I was a
06:47
very good experience especially with my grandparents.
06:52
I was a little too young to remember all of it.
06:58
Some of it I do, some of it I don’t.
06:58
I had a great time.
06:58
It was really very good.
06:58
00:08:21
06:58
What were your favorite pastimes?
06:59
We had chores to do.
07:02
My brothers were close in age.
07:04
I had a brother next to
07:11
me and we had
07:34
do chores.
07:36
Saturday we would do our chores so we could run outside and play.
07:37
We would play with the neighborhood children.
07:38
We would play football and baseball; there wasn’t basketball.
07:38
Football and baseball we would play.
07:38
We would go out for hours.
07:40
We wouldn’t
08:00
go too far out of the
08:03
neighborhood.
08:04
There was a bus system we could catch to go
08:12
to town but other than that…It was great.
08:13
So it was you and three brothers?
08:17
Yeah, three brothers.
08:18
My
08:21
mother and
08:28
my brothers we lived together.
08:30
My uncle had his children who were around with us.
08:32
Two sons, Charles and Fred and so they were part of the kids.
08:34
So I got to play with them.
08:34
I could tell you some stories!
08:34
[laughing]
08:34
oh I would love to hear them; I bet they were good times.
08:34
00:10:05
08:34
I know that my brother next to me was kind of strange.
08:34
He always for some reason wanted to not get in trouble but agitate, get attention.
08:34
That was a real way about him.
08:34
He must have had four or five kids.
08:34
One was Catherine which was about our age.
08:34
They were at the time in school, we were in school.
08:34
So my brother Allan decided come on, lets throw dirt at Catherine.
08:34
So we did but Catherine was tough.
08:34
So she came out there and fired us up with big clots of dirt.
08:34
I haven’t seen her for some time.
08:34
But she was tough.
08:34
Growing up, it was fun.
08:34
It was great.
08:34
Often times, the situation when you were in a segregated society, and when you
08:34
go to school and you have role models.
08:34
In elementary school I had a cousin of mine that was the principal.
08:34
So a lot of people were role models.
08:34
What was established was a confidence that you could achieve anything you wanted
08:34
to achieve regardless of the situation.
08:34
That was something many African American students today in
08:34
academics don’t experience.
08:34
To have a person that looks like you saying you can be successful.
08:34
That is the biggest thing.
08:34
Maybe you didn’t have all the technology that we have today but there was a
08:34
caring that was passed on at that time.
08:34
00:12:10
08:34
DM Was the segregation that you experienced was that challenging?
08:34
Or did it held develop community sense?
08:34
What was the experience to have that segregation growing up and in school?
08:34
You really didn’t notice it as much.
08:34
You didn’t notice it, In many ways you were protected by the community.
08:34
There were three maybe four African American communities.
08:34
One on the south side, one on the east side, I live in a place called
08:34
red miles in the city of the city.
08:34
And so, you could go two blocks three blocks from my house and
08:34
there were white communities.
08:34
You could go to different parts and you would have maybe one house with
08:34
African Americans but the rest of the homes in the area were white community.
08:34
So it depends.
08:34
Although it depends it was segregated in some ways it was so in others.
08:34
It just wasn’t.
08:34
It wasn’t as segregated as people thought, people were able to communicate.
08:34
0:13:56
08:34
You said that you worked while you were growing up
08:34
I wanted to work, the first thing that I remember; I started off at maybe 7 or 8.
08:34
I told my mom that I wanted to earn some money.
08:34
So told me what you do is go around the community and ask people if they
08:34
wanted me to wash their windows.
08:34
So I did that.
08:34
I had this one house that this lady said “no,no I don’t want you to wash
08:34
my windows, I want you to paint my back porch.” She said she had a bunch of steps.
08:34
I told her lady I’ve never done that before but she said oh you can do it.
08:34
[comical story; both Dani and Larry laughing] You can do it,
08:34
Just make sure the area is covered.
08:34
OK….. I did it and made sure it was covered.
08:34
And she said, that is a great job!
08:34
So, that’s the confidence there.
08:34
You can do that.
08:34
Then working at the restaurant.
08:34
My brother next to me worked there.
08:34
We would go Saturday and Sunday.
08:34
They would come pick us up and bring us back home.
08:34
I worked the counter and he would go finish the kitchen
08:34
area when it was shut off.
08:34
The day ended at six.
08:34
So they would teach us how to do things.
08:34
They were brothers, 3 or 4 of them.
08:34
The one that was the cook, he had been there the longest.
08:34
And then there was the other brother that kind of ran the whole thing.
08:34
They had a restaurant, hotel, nightclub.
08:34
At the nightclub they also had a swimming pool.
08:34
So we could go swimming.
08:34
They also had slots machines.
08:34
You could gamble.
08:34
I didn’t go there but my brothers would.
08:34
He would come in at 8 when we were about to change shifts
08:34
and he would do the receipts.
08:34
He [owner] had a son and a wife and they would come pick me up and take me back.
08:34
I also set pins at a bowling alley.
08:34
I delivered milk.
08:34
Those are the things I did up until maybe sixth grade.
08:34
00:16:33
08:34
When you went on to high school you said you moved to go to high school.
08:34
Actually I moved in 7th grade to Birmingham.
08:34
I was there for a year then to Tuscaloosa for 8th and 9th grade
08:34
and then moved to Washington.
08:34
and finished up schooling there in Washington?
08:34
right
08:34
When you were in school in the early grade levels, what were you interested in?
08:34
What did you like to study.
08:34
I liked social science and math.
08:34
Math is easier for me.
08:34
But I was one of those guys that didn’t like doing homework.
08:34
Math was easier for me until I got in the 7th grade and had to take algebra.
08:34
So in 7th grade algebra the homework and practice, I didn’t want to do.
08:34
So I enjoyed social science.
08:34
Probably my biggest one was social science.
08:34
I feel in love with social science.
08:34
That was my best subject.
08:34
Up until 7th grade it was math, just not algebra.
08:34
When you got to 7th grade and you had to take algebra.
08:34
When you finished school did you go into the military or straight into college?
08:34
When you finished high school?
08:34
When I moved to Tacoma I meet a guy by the name of Brad Anderson.
08:34
He lived next door.
08:34
So we became good friends.
08:34
He was a grade or two ahead of me.
08:34
And he said to me, I’m going to show you what to do.
08:34
He happened to be the most popular guy in high school.
08:34
He was one of those athletes.
08:34
It was a huge high school.
08:34
On the first day, he took me through the cafeteria line and they gave
08:34
him as much food as he wanted.
08:34
So I didn’t really have a clue so I hung out with him and met some more friends.
08:34
He and about three or four of his friends, his classmates,
08:34
went to a community college.
08:34
They were into football, they played football.
08:34
So he said he wanted me to come to this college.
08:34
After I graduated I worked maybe a year then I followed him to the junior college.
08:34
At the time, I played basketball and did ok in basketball as well as academics.
08:34
One of the friends of the coach said they didn’t have an African American player
08:34
on their team and wanted to see one.
08:34
So I ended up going to play basketball and did my undergrad
08:34
and later my master’s degree.
08:34
While playing basketball?
08:34
No, no didn’t.
08:34
I couldn’t I had to be serious about school.
08:34
The first year I had a child so I had to support my child.
08:34
So I worked full time and went to school.
08:34
While I attended college.
08:34
You were a busy man!
08:34
[laughing] It didn’t seem that busy.
08:34
I guess so.
08:34
How did you decide what you wanted to study going into college and
08:34
how did that transition for you?
08:34
00:21:25
08:34
I started in business and then I had a friend who was in
08:34
sociology and I loved sociology.
08:34
I moved to sociology.
08:34
Then Psychology and then back to sociology.
08:34
You can change your major it’s not a big deal.
08:34
My philosophy is you start it doesn’t matter where you start but
08:34
you will figure it out as you go as long as you take the core courses.
08:34
What about sociology catches you?
08:34
that makes it so interesting for you?
08:34
I think it is more a study of groups.
08:34
Of Behavioral groups.
08:34
I think sociology is in my blood ,so to speak.
08:34
Because of my parents and their behavior.
08:34
My father being a minister and my mother being a teacher.
08:34
I didn’t realize it at the time but I see it now more.
08:34
I see it in my kids.
08:34
I think in a way I encourage them.
08:34
I see them doing some of the same things that I did.
08:34
So a lot of it, I think it is just there.
08:34
It sounds like your parents both had very involved jobs interacting with people.
08:34
My mother especially.
08:34
I remember her whole life I never saw her get upset.
08:34
She was always mellow, no matter what.
08:34
She was very supportive.
08:34
Very mellow.
08:34
Never upset.
08:34
And no matter what I did she was supportive.
08:34
My father was, although I spent time with him not as much.
08:34
He would move and we stayed.
08:34
You said you were working, going to school and had your first daughter.
08:34
Did you get married before that or did you have a significant other?
08:34
We got married.
08:34
The marriage was not a responsibility.
08:34
But a child is a responsibility.
08:34
I worked.
08:34
Especially in summer.
08:34
When I was in Jr college I worked for the railroads, there were a
08:34
lot of those jobs in those days.
08:34
Part of the time, was a conductor but not on the train.
08:34
On weekends I would open up the station and wait for the first train to come.
08:34
The other part of the time, I was a baggage handler.
08:34
That was during the summer.
08:34
I made enough tips that summer to live on.
08:34
After I did that, the railroad had a lumber yard.
08:34
And so this guy said he would show me how to put lumber on the train.
08:34
So that was one summer, I worked for the railroad.
08:34
And then one summer I worked for the post office.
08:34
I collected the mail in the downtown area.
08:34
Then on Christmas break I would work for the post office.
08:34
It was kind of a central station in Tacoma that was Christmas break.
08:34
This guy there looked at my arms and said “you’ve got long arms, I’m going
08:34
to make you a sweeper.” So then I had to work with these people that were
08:34
sorting the mail, I had to go and reach in and get the mail from certain areas.
08:34
I had to reach in, I was the sweeper [Dani laughing at story.]there were only two
08:34
of us, and you had to constantly move.
08:34
We were always moving.
08:34
I didn’t have a problem working.
08:34
Between junior college and Pacific Lutheran I was a sealer.
08:34
Make sure seals where fuel would be were air tight.
08:34
That was hard work.
08:34
So I went back to school.
08:34
Before I started school, there was a little hospital called western state.
08:34
I worked there as an aid.
08:35
For about three years.
08:35
I stared on swing shift then night shift.
08:35
That was probably the hardest job ever.
08:35
00:28:05
08:38
What was challenging and what did you learn from the experience?
08:38
The challenge was staying awake all night.
08:39
[laughing] We didn’t have to do much.
08:39
We would engage patients in activities.
08:40
Lots of cards and dominoes.
08:40
We would take them to boxing matches.
08:40
Strangely enough, I got along well.
08:40
I had no problems, that was the swing shift.
08:40
I would start around 3, I would work at night then go to school.
08:40
At that time I was in grad school I had an assistantship.
08:40
My first class was at 10, so I’d go home after work and try to get some rest
08:40
and then I would teach sociology in the morning and take classes in the afternoon.
08:40
Then work and do it all over again.
08:41
I did that maybe a year and a half.
08:41
Before coming to OSU.
08:41
I came here in 72’.
08:50
It was strange, I’ve told people I’ve been lucky my whole life.
08:51
A lot of it has to do with skill and a lot of it has to do with luck.
08:51
I was working, I met the football coach and there was a recruiter
08:52
in the admissions office that also
08:55
played football.
08:56
We got to
09:46
know each other and actually we did
10:54
some recruiting
11:14
together for
11:34
the University of Washington who in those days was having problems with the football
11:35
coach and African American players.
11:35
I got to know the football coach extremely well.
11:35
So when I applied to come here they had a doctorate in CSSA.
11:37
I applied and I was going to complete
11:59
my
12:26
masters and the football coach came to me
12:46
and
13:00
said you
16:20
will be going to Oregon State University for your doctorate.
16:25
I later found out that the football coach was very close friends with the vice
16:25
president of student affairs at OSU.
16:25
Like very close.
17:10
So
17:55
I’m sure he got me into the program.
17:55
And to get into the program you had to have an assistantship.
17:56
00:31:31
17:58
[Interview interrupted by guest who knows Larry very friendly conversations.
17:58
Visitors are very happy to see Larry on Campus.
17:58
He is very gracious.]
17:58
Good to see both of you I'll be in touch with both of you.
18:00
you know we have interviews coming up for the promise program?
18:00
It is starting again!
18:01
You know we had a great keynote speaker last year?
18:02
[Laughing!]
18:06
I have a feeling that keynote speaker was you?
18:09
yeah it was me, I don’t think it was that good
18:10
Do
18:17
they work with the educational opportunities program?
18:17
no, That is Terryl Ross, he is the director of for Community and Diversity.
18:17
She works for him.
18:18
They used to be in HR.
18:18
It was probably nice for them to see you.
18:19
33:02
18:19
So They sought you out to come here?
18:19
To come to OSU?
18:19
Well I applied.
18:20
I made a decision that I was going to go here and I went to the library and
18:21
got this book and it talked about the top five CSSA programs in the country
18:21
for a PHD and OSU was in the top 5.
18:21
In those days that program was mostly on the east coast.
18:21
It was good, Penn state was number one.
18:21
But we had an excellent program.
18:21
I’m sure the football coach informed the vice president.
18:21
He was in charge of the program [president], it was under student affairs.
18:21
I picked that up later.
18:21
It was luck.
18:21
So when you got here, you started in 72?
18:21
I started in grad school and you had to have an
18:30
assistantship.
18:31
They were
18:39
for
18:43
a year.
18:43
So I did that for the first year.
18:53
Mine was unusual.
18:54
I
19:10
was assistant night manager.
19:10
I
19:21
did
19:31
that for a year.
19:32
The second year I had an assistantship at the EOP.
19:32
Things
19:53
luck out my third year was 74 and
20:00
I was hired by EOP and I was in charge of recruiting and I did that my four year.
20:03
So the movement into the EOP, how did you decide to incorporate that
20:08
into your PhD work here?
20:10
I had read a lot about liberal learning centers.
20:10
I thought that for EOP students, it would be a great opportunity for them.
20:11
For them to live in the area, take classes in the area and have their
20:11
counselors and advisors in that area.
20:11
So I took a trip to Michigan State.
20:11
They have some of the best liberal learning centers I think in the world.
20:11
They did it partly because of the weather.
20:11
They had at least four.
20:11
One was science, one was social science.
20:11
They had these dormitories.
20:11
Students lived on the top floor.
20:11
Or the top floor I should say.
20:12
It was all students that majored in science.
20:15
The second level they had an eating area, the third level is
20:24
where they had classes and faculty.
20:24
So they had to take
20:51
one
20:58
class outside the center but
22:51
all
24:34
the other classes had to
25:11
be
25:23
within the center.
25:23
I thought it would work great
26:02
for especially students of color.
26:05
In
26:13
those days
26:20
students of color were a little hesitant to come to OSU.
26:20
So I thought for that first year it would be good if they had a community.
26:21
So that was basically my dissertation.
26:21
That’s what I did.
26:21
When I saw Michigan State, I thought wow, this is great.
26:21
I tried to replicate it, At
26:24
the
26:59
time it was so convenient.
27:35
So I had a committee
28:29
here at OSU,
28:41
and I had a group of students.
29:42
My
30:01
control group was a group of students taking psych.
30:35
Development.
30:52
They were a class.
31:59
00:38:05
32:33
How did
32:37
the program once you got it off the ground and watched it evolve?
32:37
How did that go?
32:37
It went
34:07
well.
34:07
Look at the statistics.
34:09
Not
34:29
only did they do well, they
35:21
got
35:38
comfortable.
35:40
One of the most frightening things about students of color is that many
35:41
come from small rural communities.
35:41
And they come to Corvallis and for them it is this huge city
35:41
so to speak, OSU is a huge city.
35:42
I talked to some students and they said they didn’t want
35:42
to leave the room to go eat.
35:42
I didn’t know
35:59
where to
36:06
go, so I just stayed in my room.
36:09
That’s really frightening.
36:11
Absolutely
36:14
In addition to that we also started
36:19
a retreat.
36:19
The
36:25
students get to know
36:29
faculty
36:32
and
36:34
older students.
36:37
We took them out, for the first
36:47
few years we took them out, to a camp called Tadmore at
36:48
the foot of the cascades.
36:48
It is a beautiful area.
36:48
But it is cold, it’s September.
36:51
They had individual cabins.
36:54
They
37:01
got to know
37:05
each other and did well after we stared doing the retreats.
37:07
In the
37:10
first
37:14
year a lot of them would be sick.
37:16
I would ask them to give me just one quarter.
37:19
If you want to go home after the first quarter I will help you to
37:22
get home, but I want you to do
37:28
all your homework, do
37:31
all your tests do everything you need as a student.
37:34
After that time, they wouldn’t want to go home any longer.
37:39
It was
37:44
probably building a trust.
37:46
A trust in you and the other faculty
37:47
You would be surprised at the small communities.
37:47
I would visit the small communities they were very
37:55
small.
37:56
They
38:07
had high school and home school consultants and they were the ones that
38:09
would get the students to come to OSU.
38:09
Then 4-H stated having a conference every year in Pendleton [OR] and they
38:20
would invite us.
38:22
This has been
38:37
going on 14 years and we have been going every year.
38:38
And what we’ve found
38:41
is that there are many amazing students
38:45
who haven’t thought about college.
38:46
So
38:53
we’d go,
39:08
we’d set up a booth.
39:09
We took the opportunity to recruit.
39:17
The first year
39:20
I got a call saying we got this great student that wants to go to OSU.
39:23
At the time I was on the scholarship committee and I said send me a
39:25
transcript and after looking at it I said she would not have a
39:26
problem getting the scholarship.
39:26
They insisted on me meeting this student.
39:27
I said, I don’t need to meet the student, she has great grades.
39:28
She just got her MBA by the way.
39:28
Very bright.
39:28
When I met her she, came to OSU, she was business.
39:31
She came to school, but then her husband wanted to move.
39:37
So they moved back to Pendleton.
39:40
She was worried about her son.
39:41
She wanted him to go
39:53
to college.
39:53
She was worried about him
39:57
in
40:49
high school too.
40:49
She wanted him to go to Portland.
40:50
00:43:45
40:56
Did you help to get scholarships for certain students to
41:01
make their way here to OSU?
41:04
They system did that, I just happened to be on the committee.
41:08
We had scholarships for entering freshmen and some for
41:17
transferring sophomores and juniors.
41:21
We didn’t have enough scholarships, there were just 6.
41:23
There was just
41:26
not
41:32
enough for the freshmen.
41:34
Transfer students had no problem.
41:38
It was a struggle.
41:38
Tuition remission helped but then they took that away.
41:40
We fought for it but they took it away.
41:41
They used it as leverage to recruit out of state students.
41:41
We had a plan we developed over 6 months and presented to the provost and provost
41:42
knew the people that ran admissions.
41:42
The school is still a business.
41:42
45:26
41:42
How did you transition?
41:42
You were doing your PhD here then you transitioned into the
41:42
director of the EOP program.
41:56
How
42:00
did you transition from a student into a staff role and then to a director
42:21
role where
42:31
you were overseeing everything that was going on at that time?
42:34
Timing.
42:34
Back to the timing!
42:34
Yeah that’s right.
42:36
I became a staff member, actually a faculty member, in ’74.
42:46
When I started I was in charge of financial aid and recruiting for the EOP.
42:53
And in ’73 people were laughing.
42:53
They said, “We need you in EOP.” In ‘83, no ‘82, the director for
42:55
affirmative action decided to take a leave—she was going to do
43:02
some
43:19
type of an internship—and so there
43:25
was
43:54
an opening for that job.
43:56
I applied for that, and I got it for a year.
44:00
After my year, the president said, [I can impress you]?
44:03
to go back
44:05
to EOP.
44:06
I was starting to make trouble.
44:09
[laughter]
44:09
Uh oh, you were a troublemaker?
44:09
[laughter]
44:10
Well, you see, there were some things that were wrong.
44:12
There were a couple things that were wrong.
44:14
These were big things.
44:15
And it was a big university deal.
44:15
There were some students from Korea.
44:15
They came from a different culture, and they were accused of… they were
44:16
in business, they were military there, so the military sent them, and so
44:16
they were accused of plagiarizing.
44:16
In that culture it was okay to do that, and I tried to explain
44:17
that to the committee—they, the people in business—please just give
44:17
them a chance to retake the exam, and it wouldn’t be a big deal.
44:33
No,
44:53
they were going to kick them out of school, and they were going
44:57
to do all this other stuff.
45:00
And so they
45:03
actually came to me, and I investigated it and found out that they did not
45:04
plagiarize, and that was a big deal.
45:04
The university said, “You can’t,” and they were going to kick them out.
45:04
But they eventually, all business, graduated with Master’s in Business.
45:04
12
45:04
So the president came over and said, “You’ve created some problems
45:04
over here, so you need to go back and work for EOP.” So I said,
45:15
“Okay.” I really didn’t have a problem.
45:16
The truth is that I had wanted to go back to EOP anyways.
45:16
But
45:23
when I went back I went back as director, because the current director had moved to
45:24
a different position in administration.
45:24
So actually, she went on leave, and I was the acting director, then she
45:25
came back, and then she moved on to a different position in administration.
45:25
The president appointed me to the job.
45:25
What
45:31
do you think being in that role and being in that position, what were the challenges
45:31
that you faced during that time?
45:31
48:58
45:38
Faculty.
45:38
Faculty was
46:07
the biggest challenge.
46:08
There were four,
46:21
actually five categories of students that we wanted to recruit and support.
46:22
They started with the poor students of color, older than normal
46:22
students, students, students from rural areas, students
46:37
who struggled in high school, and single parents.
46:43
Those were the five groups that we were wanting to support, but often
46:48
times faculty didn’t really understand their needs, and the needs of those
46:53
students are the same as those of other students, but those needs
46:56
have to be met in different ways.
47:00
And I wanted to
47:06
know faculty, and I recruited one of the best math
47:12
teachers, and I kept increasing the math courses, because he was doing such
47:16
a great job and the students would go to the regular math classes and take
47:20
those tests and didn’t understand it and couldn’t do it, but they came to Derron’s
47:21
class and he’d explain it and they would really get it and they could move on.
47:32
And not only did I
47:36
see that in math, but I saw it in writing and some of the basic courses.
48:02
We called them developmental courses.
48:03
These were courses that students had not been exposed to, they didn’t know
48:03
anything about it, they had trouble reading, had trouble with English.
48:03
We could only give them 12 credit hours of developmental classes, so we
48:04
wanted to start them at a four credit developmental class, which is why we
48:04
called them developmental courses, but there were always road blocks
48:09
with the faculty.
48:10
And let me give you a very good example.
48:10
I had an outstanding math instructor, Michael Wilco.
48:14
Michael
48:18
Wilco was really good.
48:18
So he created two math courses 102 and 103.
48:24
Well, let me go back
48:31
a little.
48:31
We would give all the students a placement exam, we wanted to know
48:31
where they should be, because we didn’t want to put someone in a class
48:34
if they didn’t need to be there.
48:36
So we created a placement exam, and depending on their score,
48:39
that’s where we put them.
48:39
So we created Math 101, 102, 103.
48:41
So say they started at 102, then
48:46
they would go to 103, then
48:51
to 111.
48:51
We refined those classes.
48:54
And so, Wilco taught Derron Coles how to teach math.
48:59
And Derron Coles refined what Wilko had done.
49:04
You really did well.
49:06
And so, I went to
49:22
the curriculum council and I said, I’m going to submit these courses
49:23
and I want students to get credit.
49:24
On the class schedule, it would be “development.” So the chair of the
49:25
curriculum council was also a member of the math club and he didn’t want this.
49:27
I fought him for
49:30
about two years.
49:32
Eventually
49:35
they changed the chair of the math department.
49:37
So we [the chair of the math department and I] had lunch one
49:47
day, and we were talking about it, how the chair of the curriculum council said we
49:49
shouldn’t give them college credit, and the chair of the math department, who had
49:55
his PhD from Princeton, said, “Oh yeah,
50:01
we can do that!” So he was the best faculty member we had.
50:07
I would email him and say “we want to teach this math
50:12
course,” and he would say “no problem.” And Derron had actually gotten his PhD
50:14
in engineering, but in order to know engineering you have to know math,
50:19
so he taught math.
50:20
The math program worked out well to the point where the math department is now
50:23
teaching these developmental courses.
50:23
They wouldn’t do it back then.
50:23
But now, it’s so solid… It works so well.
50:23
Right, it works well.
50:23
There’s an online place where you can go and Google any instructor,
50:24
and they will show you how the students rank the professor.
50:27
So I would do
50:31
that with
50:38
Derron—he was the best math teacher.
50:38
He is
50:57
still here in EOP.
51:00
So that was the biggest challenge was math.
51:03
The other biggest challenge
51:10
was, well, English was okay.
51:14
We had developmental courses, which they moved, so they don’t do that any more.
51:22
We also had a tutoring program where we would hire people
51:27
to come in
51:31
and tutor.
51:33
Courses and scholarships were the biggest.
51:37
We also had problems eventually with admissions, because we would advocate
51:41
for students to be in, and we would show them everywhere, and these were students
51:47
that had the potential for success, which was why we brought them here.
51:50
We had a very good success rate with our students, not only getting in, but
51:59
completing their degree.
52:00
That was, often times, I don’t know how to put it.
52:02
Some of the faculty were like “I don’t want you to be successful.” They
52:08
don’t like that because, in my mind it tells them that these are groups
52:13
of students you cannot serve or don’t serve, that you can but you refuse to
52:19
serve, then someone else can actually
52:28
fulfill their needs and do it.
52:28
And funding is also a big issue.
52:28
55:20
52:32
How about on the other end of the spectrum?
52:34
What were the most rewarding experiences and seeing the program
52:38
through and sitting in the chair that you did, what was the most rewarding
52:42
part of that for you personally?
52:44
Seeing students graduate.
52:46
Students coming back and saying, “Hey, I really appreciate what you’ve done—what
52:50
the program has done.” Seeing students come in and struggling initially and
52:55
go on, and not only graduate but go on to graduate and professional programs.
52:58
Now
53:02
a lot of them are doctors, a lot of professionals, a lot
53:06
of PhDs actually came through
53:13
EOP.
53:14
And we used to do [we still do I guess] a graduation and a banquet
53:19
at the end where we invite all the graduates and their families.
53:21
It would usually be the day before commencement.
53:22
And that to me was the biggest thing.
53:24
Students would
53:28
contact me
53:33
and say, “I’m doing great.” I have a student who contacted me six months ago,
53:41
and said, Larry, I’ve just been admitted to UCLA in the PhD program. I’ve got a
53:50
full ride everyday for five years, and I appreciate you helping me getting here.
53:57
I had to go lobby for her in the admissions office.
53:59
She was living here in Corvallis, but was from
54:01
India and she was young and didn’t quite understand the culture here in the states.
54:02
So she struggled, and she shouldn’t have been, well she
54:02
needed to get out of high school.
54:02
But once she got here, she took off.
54:02
And she wrote a letter to the president, and sent an email asking
54:02
that OSU continue to support EOP.
54:02
A lot of professionals have come through the program.
54:02
Hopefully the program will continue.
54:02
That’s the only way to change things—to provide opportunities for other students.
54:02
57:38
54:04
Do you have, like her, quite a few
54:49
students who
54:57
you’ve seen after what they’ve done after the EOP program, five years
55:01
down the road or ten years down the road and does that feel rewarding to
55:05
see where these people have gone with
55:15
themselves?
55:15
Oh absolutely.
55:15
Absolutely.
55:15
I did, they decided they wanted to do a retirement reception for me, it
55:17
brought back some of the alumni, and they actually took a group picture,
55:25
and I got a post card with every body on there, and there were these four
55:35
or five medical doctors, they were two, twins, identical twins, I
55:36
couldn’t tell one apart from the other.
55:39
They
55:50
really wanted to go to med school, and they did well academically.
55:56
And the University of Washington had a program, a summer program called MCAT.
56:02
Not the MCAT.
56:03
I can’t remember what it was.
56:04
But it was a summer program for kids interested in med school.
56:08
The twins attended.
56:09
That year we had three students from OSU go from EOP development.
56:15
So at the end of the program, you take the MCATs.
56:17
And so I saw them when they came back after the summer program, and asked
56:25
them, “how was the summer program?” And they said, “Great, we did great.
56:27
We enjoyed it.” And I said, “How did you do on the MCATs?” “We didn’t
56:33
do well at all.” So I said, “what are you going to do?” They said,
56:37
“we decided we are going to go
56:42
to the health sciences university and we’re going to work in a lab,
56:45
and then we’re going to reapply to med school.” So they stayed there a
56:51
year and took the MCATS again and reapplied to med school
56:57
and they were admitted to two.
57:00
So they went to the University of Washington med school, and they graduated
57:06
and now one is in Boise, the other is in Seattle.
57:11
So those are
57:16
the moments.
57:16
I had one student who actually had to go to Mexico because he couldn’t
57:21
get into any of the med schools here.
57:23
He
57:27
said in Mexico, what you have to do is, the way you learn the
57:30
material is you have to become the teacher of a certain subject.
57:38
Everyone has to do it.
57:41
He learned so much, so when he came back after two years in Mexico, he was admitted
57:46
Oregon Health Sciences University.
57:46
He has
57:53
thrived.
57:53
He’s a doctor now.
57:53
So today, a lot of them stay in the area.
57:56
Some of them just fight, fight, fight.
57:59
But no one really gave them an opportunity.
58:04
The biggest thing to me is opportunity and support.
58:08
That’s what you really
58:14
need.
58:14
How did you make the decision to retire from the position?
58:21
How did you know that the timing was right?
58:23
01:12
58:24
the timing was right but there were some other things that were involved.
58:29
My
58:32
family is spread out, my kids are spread out.
58:35
Remember I told you I had one my first year of college?
58:38
Well I have two other ones.
58:40
One was born in 83’ and the other was born in 86’.
58:44
We were really, really close.
58:46
At the time they were in college.
58:48
They would come home from college
58:51
and we would spend the holidays together.
58:53
Christmas.
58:54
And then they would leave and I’d say I’m not sure I want to go back.
58:55
It was getting harder and harder.
58:55
I knew it was time.
58:55
The thing that really did it was a budget cut.
58:55
There were 3 of us that were at the time to retire.
58:55
I said it would be best.
58:56
I told them I thought this would be best but I asked them
58:58
what they thought we should do.
59:02
And so I decided
59:38
I would
59:42
retire and I talked to the other two staff members about retiring and I told
59:42
them that there are young staff members and if we don’t retire these other people
59:45
will not have jobs and that is wrong.
59:46
And so we decided to retire and it was great timing.
59:47
For
59:54
me it was good timing!
59:55
[Larry laughs] but it was good, it was good.
59:59
Retirement is great.
1:00:00
DM- Do you consider yourself retired?
1:00:03
LG- I do
1:00:03
DM- It sounds like you are still very involved
1:00:03
LG- I am involved but I can choose.
1:00:03
I still have
1:00:12
a routine.
1:00:13
I
1:00:17
am involved with a couple things.
1:00:18
I am involved with youth in Oregon.
1:00:19
With the Oregon youth authority, which is involved with youth that are in trouble.
1:00:22
So I do that, and especially for
1:00:31
the African American youth.
1:00:33
We were told five years
1:00:41
ago that the African American Youth didn’t think African
1:00:41
American adults cared about them.
1:00:44
And most of them are out of the court.
1:00:47
Most of them have a leadership group this is at McLaren which is in Newport.
1:00:53
They have a leadership group that would meet most of them there.
1:00:53
There were four of us from OSU that decided we would start meeting with them.
1:00:53
So, we’ve been doing this for five years.
1:00:53
We told them if we commit ourselves to come here and meet with you
1:00:53
than you will have to change your behavior; and they said they would.
1:00:53
That is the biggest reward I think.
1:00:53
Also we encouraged some of them to go to school.
1:00:53
There were two that were released and came here to OSU.
1:00:53
To me it is a big deal because some of them that are in there are so bright.
1:00:53
And that is why they are in there because they are so bright.
1:00:53
They are not challenged in high school or with the community.
1:00:53
In many ways they are just sad.
1:00:53
And I hate to see them go back to Portland because that is how they get into trouble.
1:00:53
So I do that.
1:00:53
They have three facilities.
1:00:53
Woodburn, McLaren, and Hillcrest.
1:00:53
And then there is Oakcreek which is here in Albany.
1:00:53
Especially Woodburn and Hillcrest, that is where I go to work with them, the youth.
1:00:53
Terrell, the president for the board for minority affairs, he
1:00:53
appointed me to that board and it only meets every three months.
1:00:53
We’ve got a meeting coming up next Tuesday in Portland but that is a special one.
1:00:53
They probably don’t want me to come [Larry laughs] but I need to talk to them.
1:00:54
So that is what I do.
1:00:54
My kids are not grown up.
1:00:54
My youngest is still at home with me.
1:00:54
We do a lot; we see each other a lot.
1:00:54
We spend a lot of time together.
1:00:54
I enjoy that, it is a lot of fun.
1:00:54
Where are your other children?
1:00:54
Are they in Corvallis?
1:00:54
I have one in Corvallis.
1:00:54
My youngest is in Corvallis, my middle one is in Seattle.
1:00:54
She works for the University of Washington.
1:00:54
My oldest daughter, she is the assistant district attorney in Albany New York.
1:00:54
Her job is really strange.
1:00:54
Not strange.
1:00:54
She is in charge of public integrity.
1:00:54
That is her job.
1:00:54
She investigates and prosecutes Politians and police.
1:00:55
So that is her job.
1:00:55
But she enjoys it.
1:00:55
To me, it would frighten me [laughs] . But for her it doesn’t
1:00:55
bother her, it doesn’t frighten her.
1:00:55
She is just as comfortable as she can be.
1:00:55
she must be a strong woman
1:00:55
she also was in the class of 88’ at the air force academy.
1:00:55
They changed requirements to get in, the physical requirements to
1:00:55
get in, just after she got in.
1:00:55
Before she was admitted you had to do chin ups and pushups.
1:00:55
You had to do so many or you couldn’t get in.
1:00:55
and so I started going to Dixon with her and we would lift weights.
1:00:55
you did, that is great!
1:00:55
07:28
1:00:55
I got really big [laughs]
1:01:10
, but
1:04:45
anyway her final and exam was at U of O so
1:04:54
we would take her down there.
1:04:55
The first time she didn’t make it.
1:04:56
Actually her first two times she didn’t make it.
1:04:57
The last time she finally made it but it was so late to start the academy
1:04:59
so they sent her to prep school.
1:04:59
She was going to be at the prep school and then to the academy.
1:05:01
So she graduated.
1:05:01
To me they were doing some really dangerous stuff.
1:05:11
They would do
1:05:19
this game that
1:05:23
she was the enemy and they would have to go through this jack’s valley.
1:05:26
They would be out there two or three days surviving without any food.
1:05:30
Wow, by yourself?
1:05:31
Well there was others but no food and no water.
1:05:34
And there were people trying to capture you!
1:05:37
[laughing]
1:05:41
So she said “I
1:05:44
made it through it.” [laughing] her area was security, that is what she
1:05:50
wanted to do. So she would come home and she would bring her gun and she
1:05:51
would tell the airliner “I have a gun in my bag.” But she was okay.
1:05:51
She was tough.
1:05:51
Things don’t frighten her like they frighten other people.
1:05:51
She prosecuted police and politicians and anything.
1:05:51
Now she is Albany, the capital of New York.
1:05:51
So the legislator is there, the governor is also there.
1:05:51
So she has to investigate anything with criminal intent.
1:05:51
So Dixon, he used to be the governor of New York.
1:05:51
The saying is that he used state funds so she investigated it.
1:05:51
She called me on
1:05:56
a Friday and said “look, I investigated, he didn’t
1:06:01
violate anything.
1:06:02
On
1:06:06
Monday they, the FBI indicted him.
1:06:16
They
1:06:39
investigated him for six weeks, nothing.
1:06:40
Nothing there.
1:06:40
Then she had to go investigate Peterson.
1:06:40
He resigned as
1:07:03
the governor.
1:07:03
He did some bad stuff.
1:07:03
But
1:07:08
his
1:07:17
was not that bad.
1:07:19
He got some tickets to the World Series and the Yankees and
1:07:26
he also testified
1:07:29
in an abuse case for his driver.
1:07:32
They thought he
1:07:37
purged the stuff.
1:07:37
So her boss said look, I’m not doing this.
1:07:41
So then the attorney general said
1:07:47
I’m not touching this either.
1:07:48
So they got a special prosecutor from the New York appeals
1:07:51
court who investigated it.
1:07:55
She usually calls me on Sunday.
1:07:57
So she called on Sunday and said I just got a call from a special investigator
1:07:57
said she had to go to New York.
1:07:57
She wasn’t going to stress about it but she didn’t know what it was.
1:07:57
That is what it turned out to be.
1:07:57
01:11:01
1:07:57
That would be hard work
1:07:57
She enjoys it.
1:07:57
It is challenging for her.
1:07:57
I can’t even imagine
1:07:57
LG- the biggest thing for her was this guy was making calls to his neighbor.
1:07:57
And to others, only African Americans.
1:07:57
Threating calls.
1:07:57
They tried to get him, tried to get him but they couldn’t.
1:07:57
But they just couldn’t.
1:07:57
What happened is they thought they had him but they didn’t.
1:07:57
It was a call girl who identified him.
1:07:57
So they got him.
1:07:57
They found out that he was a police officer in New York City and then
1:07:57
he moved to Albany and worked for
1:08:02
the state as a lawyer [laughing]
1:08:05
. DM- What a mess
1:08:07
LG- It gets worse but
1:08:18
I won’t tell you about that.
1:08:20
So she had to investigate that.
1:08:40
There
1:09:43
is always something going on in Albany,
1:09:48
always something.
1:09:52
Washington and New york have a prosecutor agreement that after
1:09:59
some years she can move out
1:10:04
to Washington without taking the bar again.
1:10:04
But they moved out there about 3 years ago and she loves it.
1:10:10
Her husband wants to move but she doesn’t.
1:10:11
DM- she doesn’t want to move?
1:10:11
LG - No, I knew she wouldn’t.
1:10:15
She enjoys what she is
1:10:21
doing.
1:10:21
I knew she would.
1:10:22
It’s good.
1:10:22
DM – do you have any grand babies?
1:10:23
01:13:11
1:10:24
LG – No, no grandbabies [laughs] not at all.
1:10:31
My youngest two aren’t married.
1:10:33
Not yet.
1:10:35
I told them they can’t even move out until they turn 35 because that is
1:10:43
when your brain in fully developed.
1:10:43
I said that but they moved out anyway.
1:10:45
DM- It sounds like you
1:10:55
get to spend more time with your family and are to see what your kids are doing.
1:11:00
LG- I have to go to Seattle otherwise my daughter would use all of her
1:11:09
vacation time coming here.
1:11:11
So I go up there to see her
1:11:16
for some time.
1:11:17
We have a great time.
1:11:17
She has everything planned out.
1:11:17
DM- yeah?
1:11:19
She has a schedule for you
1:11:23
two?
1:11:23
That is great
1:11:24
LG- I’m low maintenance.
1:11:25
I don’t need
1:11:29
it.
1:11:29
That is the thing about me, I don’t mind being alone.
1:11:31
A lot of people say I can’t be alone.
1:11:31
But I don’t mind it.
1:11:31
It’s okay.
1:11:31
Do
1:11:39
you have any
1:11:42
other questions?
1:11:42
We kind of got off tract there.
1:11:44
DM- It is all good information.
1:11:46
Are
1:11:48
you married right now?
1:11:49
LG- I’m a widower
1:11:50
DM-
1:11:55
When did your wife pass away?
1:11:56
01:14:47
1:11:56
LG- actually she passed away last June 14th
1:11:57
DM- oh,
1:12:06
I’m sorry.
1:12:06
no, no it’s okay.
1:12:06
She had been ill for a long time so it was something that was expected.
1:12:10
She was diagnosed with MS about 28 years ago and then
1:12:10
10 years ago she had a stroke.
1:12:11
wow that is a challenging disease to work through.
1:12:11
That must have been hard to go
1:12:14
through.
1:12:14
I’m sorry you had to go through that.
1:12:16
It is hard I’m sure.
1:12:16
I guess that last question I have; we are
1:12:39
doing this interview so we have
1:12:43
this information as a permanent record of you and your life and
1:12:47
history here and in the community.
1:12:49
If
1:12:51
there was some legacy that you leave here with OSU, what do you think that is?
1:12:54
EOP, Contributions?
1:12:54
I don’t know
1:12:54
I know that is a really hard question.
1:12:54
LG- I guess for me it is the commitment to understand.
1:12:54
A lot of students are neglected in school so you really can’t expect
1:12:54
them to come with the skills.
1:12:54
So what I really tried to do was provide them with the skills and the
1:12:54
confidence to be successful in life.
1:12:54
I knew they would get their degree and I knew they would get their career but
1:12:54
I wanted them to be successful in life as well as to give back to others.
1:12:57
And that is what it is all about it.
1:12:59
That is the only way we can really change things in the world.
1:12:59
is there anything I missed by asking you questions?
1:12:59
Anything we should add?
1:12:59
no, I can’t think of anything.
1:12:59
There is one thing [Larry looks at recorder]
1:12:59
Do you want me to turn this off?
1:12:59
no, no.
1:12:59
don’t tell people you are short, you don’t need to do that.
1:12:59
[laughing] I don’t think you are short.
1:12:59
So don’t do
1:13:40
that.
1:13:41
I’m the short person to look and I’ll meet
1:14:00
you at the bottom of the stairs.
1:14:00
You don’t need to do that.
1:14:01
no, yeah that is where we turn this off [laughing]
