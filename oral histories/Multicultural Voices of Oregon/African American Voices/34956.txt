00:02
My name is Lyndi-Rae Petty.
00:03
I will be conducting an oral history for my undergraduate
00:06
thesis at Oregon State University.
00:09
The day is May 26th, 2017, and the time is 4:10 [p.m.] . Our
00:15
interviewee can introduce herself.
00:17
Hi everyone!
00:17
My name is Haniya Ferrell and I am a current student at Oregon State.
00:22
My pronouns are she, her, and hers.
00:25
So Haniya, where were you born and raised, and what was it like growing up there?
00:30
I was born in San Francisco, California, and I was raised in Antioch, California,
00:36
which is about 45 minutes away from San Francisco going east bound.
00:40
And Antioch, when I was younger, like elementary school
00:46
aged, wasn't really diverse.
00:48
But as I got older, due to the gentrification that was happening in
00:53
Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco, black folks were being pushed out of
00:59
their homes, and a lot of them were moving to Antioch, because of Section Eight.
01:04
There was just cheaper housing.
01:06
And so, as I got older there were kind of just like this influx of black people.
01:12
So, by the time that I got to high school and close to graduating,
01:16
there was so many people of color in Antioch, and it was a really black
01:23
community, and continues to be.
01:27
So, tell me a little bit more about the community you grew up in.
01:30
How did your community shape you as a person?
01:32
Yeah!
01:33
So, the community that I grew up in, I would say, family wise and
01:37
the people I was around mostly on a daily basis, were really supportive.
01:43
And, I was never told that there was anything that I couldn't do.
01:49
I was always a really good student, and I was always pushed to do my best, even
01:56
my teachers when I was younger would always say that I was college bound.
02:01
Never, I never felt like there were any limits on myself.
02:05
And so, that's something that is a privilege for me, because I feel
02:10
like a lot of students, especially students of color, don't get these
02:13
messages, and children of color.
02:15
They don't get messages that they can do whatever they want or that
02:17
possibilities are endless, and these are messages that I got when I was younger.
02:23
That's awesome.
02:24
So, why did you end up coming to OSU?
02:28
So, I ended up at Oregon State because, well first and foremost,
02:34
I didn't know that Oregon State existed, but I got a little brochure
02:40
in the mail and it looked fun.
02:42
So, it was just one of these schools that I applied to.
02:45
I didn't apply to colleges that were in California, unfortunately.
02:50
Well, actually, I did, but that's a different story.
02:54
I applied to OSU just because it looked okay.
02:56
And then, I was actually set to go to a Historically Black College,
03:01
or HBCU is what they call it,
03:03
but those plans fell through, so Oregon State was kind of
03:06
just my back up situation.
03:09
And what was your first impression of OSU when you got here?
03:13
Yeah!
03:14
So my
03:18
first impression of OSU was, I definitely noticed the lack
03:21
of diversity that was here.
03:24
And I was just like, "Okay there's a lot of white people.
03:26
I'm not seeing any black people, any other people of color like at all."
03:35
When I first came here with my family, when we very first visited, I thought
03:40
that I was going to be okay because I was just like, "You know, white people are
03:43
cool, it's no big deal." And actually an employee who doesn't work here anymore,
03:51
we would call her Auntie Sandy, she saw me and my family on a campus tour walking
03:57
around and she was in Kerr, that's where Diversity and Cultural Engagement used to
04:04
be, it used to be Diversity Development.
04:06
And she ran out to us and she basically told me if you don't get
04:11
involved while you're here, you're not going to have a good time.
04:17
That stuck with me after she said it.
04:19
But yeah, my first impression, definitely, that was the first thing I noticed, that
04:24
there was just a lack of people of color.
04:27
And when I talk to folks that are from Oregon and different parts
04:31
of Oregon, they'll be like, "Oh yeah, when I came to OSU, it was so
04:34
diverse" and I'm just like "Yikes!
04:39
I can't relate." [laughs] So yeah, that was my first thing that I noticed.
04:45
And, who's Auntie Sandy?
04:47
Auntie Sandy.
04:48
She used to work on campus.
04:52
I can't really remember her job title or if she used to work in
04:55
Diversity and Cultural Engagement,
05:00
but you know, I don't want to tell all her business.
05:01
She no longer works on campus, but she used to.
05:03
And, she was somebody that a lot of students looked up to and confided
05:07
in, and she was kind of like one of those people on campus that, you
05:10
know, I mean, she was Auntie Sandy!
05:13
[laughs]
05:15
Okay, so, Auntie Sandy suggested that you get involved with some organizations,
05:19
and it sounds like you did...
05:21
Yeah.
05:21
So, what organizations did you get involved with when you arrived at OSU, and
05:26
what led you to get involved with them?
05:29
Okay, so my first organization I got involved with on campus before anything
05:36
was BSU [Black Student Union] , because I was just like, "I need to find
05:38
black people up in here." So I did.
05:40
But I just, I don't know, I guess that wasn't enough for me because my first
05:47
year I was having a lot of trouble getting acclimated here and I was
05:51
like, "I don't know what it is. This is not working for me." So I ended
05:54
up going home, and I didn't finish my freshman year; I went home spring term.
06:01
But
06:04
I ended up coming back because being home was worse than actually being here.
06:07
So I came back, and when I came back, I got involved in
06:10
Diversity and Cultural Engagement.
06:12
I started working at the Centro Cultural César Chávez, or the Four C's, on campus.
06:17
And the year after that, I worked in Social Change Leadership
06:20
Programs with Jasmine and Jesseanne.
06:23
And then the year after that, which is this year, I'm starting to work in ASOSU.
06:28
So, I just wanted to, well when I first started working on campus not
06:34
only did I need money, but I also wanted a community and people that I
06:40
could call a family away from home, and people that kind of made my time
06:40
here and my situation a little better.
06:40
'Cause I was just like, "Look, Oregon already sucks, so I'm just going to
06:40
need to find people that I can relate with and people that I can tolerate
06:40
and be around." And, so, yeah, I found that when I started working at DCE.
06:40
I found people.
06:40
I found administrators.
06:40
I found peers and co-workers that I was just like, "y'all..." [she taps her
06:40
heart with her fist] You know, people that I enjoyed being around and people
06:41
that I could call family away from home.
06:44
And
07:17
that, I really was enjoying myself here at Oregon State, and
07:22
I think that's really important.
07:25
So that's the reason I got involved.
07:27
So yeah!
07:29
Could you expand on what Social Change Leadership Programs was and what ASOSU is?
07:34
Yeah!
07:34
Okay, so Social Change Leadership Programs, or SCLP, is, or was a program
07:40
on campus that only lasted for two years.
07:45
Last year was the last, okay I take it back - last year was the first year that
07:52
they had student positions open and it was the last year that they were existing.
07:59
Most people had never heard of Social Change Leadership Programs, but basically
08:04
our job at Social Change Leadership Programs was to create and facilitate
08:08
social justice workshops or conversations.
08:12
We were dialogue facilitators and so whatever that looked like,
08:15
if we had to help with difficult dialogues, or if somebody wanted
08:20
some training on something, or, you know, if somebody wanted a workshop.
08:28
We did workshops with, I think, Center for Civic Engagement, them
08:31
having difficult conversations when they did their alt-break things.
08:37
So whatever people wanted us to kind of help facilitate or to help talk
08:44
about that was social justice related, we would come in and we would do that.
08:49
So that was what our job was at Social Change Leadership Programs.
08:52
And ASOSU, or the Associated Students of Oregon State
08:56
University, is student government.
08:58
So currently I am the Coordinator of Multicultural Affairs at ASOSU, and
09:03
I serve on the executive branch, and I serve under the diversity team.
09:08
So with Multicultural Affairs there's Queer Affairs, there's International
09:13
Affairs, there's Womxn Affairs, and so there's more than that, but I'm
09:16
just giving a few examples, but that's the team that I serve under in ASOSU.
09:22
Thank you for expanding.
09:24
So now moving on to the Speak Out.
09:27
Yes.
09:28
How did you become involved with organizing the Speak Out, and why
09:31
was it important for you to create a platform for students of color to
09:35
voice their concerns and experiences?
09:37
Yes!
09:38
So Jesseanne actually brought up doing the Speak Out.
09:44
And we worked at Social Change Leadership Programs last year and
09:48
there were only three student workers, which were me, Jasmine, and Jesseanne.
09:52
And so Jesseanne had brought that up to Jasmine and I, about doing the Speak Out.
09:57
Jesseanne had had a conversation with one of the administrators on campus
09:58
and they had this whole heart to heart.
10:01
Jesseanne was like, "I think we should do this.
10:03
This is what we need to do." And so, you know, obviously Jasmine and I were
10:07
all for it, we were like, "Of course!" It's really important for students
10:10
of color to get their voices heard because I feel like we have events and
10:16
stuff, like, what are they, dialogues, on campus, but nothing ever really
10:21
gets done, but Jesseanne was like, "We're doing this for action purposes.
10:27
I want to create a guideline of things that we are demanding from the
10:31
University," and I was like, "Okay, let's do it!" And like I said, it was
10:37
super super important to get those student voices out because after the
10:41
Speak Out a lot of administrators, you know, reached out to us.
10:44
They were like, "Wow, I didn't know this was going on on campus and we're just
10:48
completely shocked at the things the students were saying was going down in
10:51
classrooms and happening in other parts of campus." And it was shocking to me
10:55
that they didn't know, but they're not walking around with students on a day
11:00
to day basis, so I guess they just are oblivious to these types of things.
11:08
Yeah, that's why I found it important for students of color to give these things
11:11
out, because apparently administration just had no idea that, you know, all of
11:17
the microaggressions and macroaggressions that were going down all the time.
11:22
They just didn't know that these things were happening; they thought
11:24
that everything was peachy, so it's important to let them know that it's not.
11:29
Was there a specific catalyst moment that led to Jesseanne bringing it up?
11:33
Yeah!
11:34
So the thing that led Jesseanne to bringing it up was the things
11:39
that were going down at Mizzou.
11:40
At the time, at the University of Missouri, there
11:46
was specifically with the black students, I know the KKK was on
11:51
campus and they were harassing black students, they were throwing things
11:56
at the dorms that most of the students of color came in, they were harassing
12:02
black students, you know, trigger words, they were throwing those out.
12:08
And I think it led up to the president of the university having to resign.
12:14
It was this whole huge thing.
12:17
And we noticed that the campus climate at Missouri prior to all of that was
12:24
really similar to the campus climate at OSU and we were like, "That's not too far
12:28
of a stretch from happening," and so it was just like, we need to do something.
12:32
We need to make these demands, so that Oregon State does not end up like
12:37
Missouri, because we don't deserve that.
12:39
And so that was the catalyst event that
12:48
led this.
12:48
Thank you for expanding on that.
12:50
So, what did you hope to achieve from the Speak Out, you mentioned
12:53
some demands that you had?
12:55
Yes, we did.
12:57
We had some demands.
12:57
I wish I had the list of demands that we made.
13:00
But we, well first and foremost we just wanted the University to actually listen
13:05
and hear us out which is why we sent out a email to the President of the
13:12
university, the President's cabinet, administrators on campus, different
13:16
departments on campus, basically, "You need to be here. This is what is happening
13:21
this is where it is happening and you need to show up, and you need to show
13:24
that you care, and that you're here for the students." And so, we sent out the
13:29
email to everyone and everyone showed up.
13:35
And to be honest, really we just wanted the University to hear us and to be
13:40
like, "You can't continue to act like this is a diverse school and that
13:46
everything is so great and that all your students are having a good time and were
13:51
not. This is what's actually happening on campus. This is what you think is
13:54
happening, but this is what's really happening." And so that was kind of the
14:00
goal, we wanted more things to be put in place where students would have more
14:03
diversity training than they already get.
14:05
Because I know that students have to take a Difference, Power,
14:11
and Discrimination course...
14:13
DPD, yeah.
14:14
Yeah, a DPD course yeah, but it just really isn't enough.
14:17
So we're like what more?
14:20
We need faculty to have diversity training.
14:22
We need students to have more intense diversity training.
14:26
And we just need people to be more aware.
14:29
Just don't act silly.
14:31
We just need people to
14:34
act like they have some sense on campus.
14:38
We wanted things to be put in place where students of color feel safe, and we don't
14:43
have to explain ourselves all the time.
14:44
We don't have to tell people that we belong here.
14:46
So that was kind of what we wanted out of the whole situation.
14:47
I feel like I'm rambling, so
14:57
I'm just like [mimes driving back into a lane]
14:58
. No, no, no that's great.
15:00
Were there other folks involved with organizing the Speak Out;
15:04
I mean were there any students other than the three of you?
15:07
No.
15:08
So, it was just you and the administrators that you coordinated with?
15:12
Mmhmm [in the affirmative]
15:13
. Okay awesome.
15:15
So
15:18
how were you feeling leading up to the Speak Out?
15:21
Yeah, leading up to the Speak Out, we were really stressed.
15:27
There, yeah, I don't know, it was just really really stressful
15:31
leading up to it and planning it.
15:33
We were getting a lot of push back from administrators.
15:38
We just, I don't know, we didn't know who was going to come.
15:41
We didn't know who was going to share their voice, because it
15:45
was completely improv, open mic.
15:48
Whoever comes up comes up, so it was really stressful because is
15:51
anyone even going to say anything?
15:54
And there were a lot of people that were planning to come.
15:56
It was this whole campus wide event.
15:58
It was just really scary.
15:59
I was seriously stressed out.
16:03
And like I said before, we got a lot of push back from
16:06
administrators, specifically Diversity and Cultural Engagement.
16:10
While we were planning there were times where I kind of just broke down because
16:18
of, I don't know, I just feel like, the people on campus who specifically work
16:25
under DCE, you would think that they would be more supportive than they were, seeing
16:31
the work that they do on campus, but they weren't until it benefited them in
16:42
the end.
16:42
But we can talk about that later.
16:43
Leading up to the Speak Out, it was just, I don't know, it was a wreck.
16:47
It was really really stressful.
16:50
And how did you end up getting the space?
16:56
Gill coliseum, right?
16:58
[laughs] Oooh, okay.
17:08
[Laughs] Ah, okay, so the basketball coach, his name was Rachi?
17:13
Rachi
17:17
Wortham.
17:17
I don't know if that's his actual name.
17:19
I don't know if I'm saying it right, but yeah Rachi Wortham,
17:22
that's how we got the space.
17:25
Somebody reached out to him or something.
17:29
Jesseanne!
17:29
Shout out to Jesseanne!
17:29
Jesseanne reached out to Rachi, and we got Gill Coliseum.
17:35
[Laughs]
17:38
Thank you for elaborating on that.
17:40
Yes, you're welcome.
17:41
You know, I try.
17:45
So, what was it like for you during the Speak Out?
17:48
What did you think about the environment or the climate of the space?
17:54
A lot happened.
17:56
Okay, so during the Speak Out, at the beginning I was a little stressed
18:03
and I was really frustrated, because
18:09
at first nobody was really talking or saying anything and then there
18:14
was that one white guy that got up and he said whatever he said.
18:16
To be honest I really don't remember what he said.
18:18
I just kind of repressed it in my memory, but he said something.
18:21
I was like "You need to leave. Like, you cannot do that." But
18:25
honestly, during the Speak Out, as it got further into it, I was,
18:32
I don't know, I guess the word is relieved.
18:34
A lot of students were getting up, and sharing more than I ever expected them
18:43
to share, which I was just like, "Wow, oh my goodness," and to be honest, I
18:46
was shocked at the number of people who got up and were sharing these
18:49
stories and these horrific things that were happening to them on campus.
18:55
And, there was also the livestream of comments that were coming in,
19:01
because the event was livestreamed and there was a live-chat and people
19:04
were just being ridiculous on it.
19:06
So that was happening, and I think that I had more emotions than I could handle.
19:12
After the Speak Out I immediately broke down and started crying.
19:15
Literally as soon as it was over, I broke down and started crying.
19:19
I couldn't talk to anybody.
19:20
The Barometer was there; they were trying to talk to us, and I was like,
19:23
"I cannot do it." So, yeah, it was just kind of, it was definitely an
19:31
overwhelming feeling for me, but at the same time I think that the message
19:36
we wanted to get across, got across.
19:40
No matter how administrators took that, we did what we wanted to do.
19:45
We did our
19:50
part.
19:51
What was the campus climate like at OSU prior to the event?
19:56
Were there certain needs that the university wasn't addressing?
19:59
I know you kind of hit on some of those.
20:02
Yeah, yeah, so, I would say that there definitely was a lot of needs that
20:11
the university wasn't addressing.
20:13
I think that because we have all those cultural centers.
20:18
We have like what, 7 or 8 cultural centers?
20:20
And we have events in those cultural centers, that administration
20:24
thought that everything was good.
20:26
They were like, "Okay, students have their cultural centers. Everyone's
20:30
happy. Nothing goes down." You know?
20:33
And so, I just think that,
20:38
it was kind of like, we would have
20:45
certain events, let's see.
20:48
The university just really caters to white people and they
20:51
continue to cater to white folks.
20:54
You know, students of color get something like every so often.
20:57
We get
20:59
MLK day or whatever.
21:01
But there's nothing, everything is kind of not accessible to students of color.
21:07
You know,
21:10
family weekends and stuff like that aren't accessible to people of color.
21:14
So, and that's something that even after the Speak Out continues to happen.
21:19
And so,
21:22
there definitely is still really a large need for students of
21:26
color to be recognized and to be involved in everything, like
21:34
everything that happens on campus.
21:36
So, a little bit about the campus climate, they do not, and continue
21:43
to do things, that just cater only, solely, to one population.
21:52
What did you see happening on campus in person, maybe?
21:57
Do you think your friends felt the same as you?
22:00
About the campus climate?
22:01
About, Yeah.
22:02
Oh yeah, definitely.
22:03
Anybody that I talk to, well, I don't really... Yeah, all my friends are
22:09
people of color, except a select few
22:14
[laughs] . But yeah, my friends definitely would feel the same way.
22:17
There are things that we talk about, and there are a lot of events, like
22:22
campus wide events, my friends and I don't get involved in because
22:26
we know that they're not for us.
22:29
So yeah, definitely, we all were mutual in how we felt.
22:35
Okay, so, thank you for speaking about the Speak Out itself.
22:41
Moving on to after the Speak Out, describe the immediate response from OSU
22:48
administration regarding the Speak Out.
22:50
Did they invite you to future conversations?
22:53
If so, did you feel that your voice was heard?
22:56
Mmhmm.
22:57
So I think that after the Speak Out [laughs] , I think that the
23:02
administration was kind of like scrambling to do something.
23:05
So
23:07
they created some committees that they wanted us to be on.
23:12
Which to be honest, don't really remember what they're called; don't
23:15
really know the purpose of the committees, but they created them.
23:19
They created the Office of Equity and Inclusion?
23:25
EOA.
23:26
Equal Access and Opportunity.
23:28
Equal Access and Oppor-.
23:29
Yeah, they created a new office, new positions.
23:33
They had a position for chief diversity officer, which I don't
23:36
know who's in that position right now, but they created that position.
23:40
So those are the responses we got from the university.
23:46
I think they were talking about working on an online training
23:50
module, or something, for students.
23:52
I don't know if that even happened?
23:54
Didn't happen!
23:55
Did not happen.
23:55
Okay, well it didn't happen apparently.
23:58
And so, I don't know, I just feel like after, like immediately after, the Speak
24:02
Out people were looking to Jasmine, Jesseanne, and I for guidance and were
24:06
just like "Okay, so we wanna get together with y'all," and we didn't really do
24:10
this, yes we did create the space for other students of color to speak, we
24:15
planned this, but were not the only three students that are feeling the way.
24:19
Obviously so many people got up and said a lot, so it's just like,
24:22
"Please reach out to other students."
24:26
So yeah, I don't know, I feel like in that situation, the administration didn't
24:30
really know what to do so they did what we thought what they, we wanted them to do.
24:37
So yeah, I feel like that was their immediate response.
24:41
Also, afterwards, I don't know if you were planning to ask
24:44
me about the Ed Ray meeting?
24:46
Yeah, I am.
24:47
Oh okay, I'll stop with that question then.
24:50
So how did you feel about the immediate response and action of the administration?
24:56
Yeah.
24:57
I just feel like it was a lot.
25:01
I just, I don't know, I kind of wanted to do the Speak Out and leave it there.
25:07
And I just kind of wanted everyone to leave me alone, because like I said,
25:12
they were just reaching out to us, like a lot afterwards and were like, "Do
25:15
you wanna be on this committee? Do you wanna do this? Do you wanna do it?"
25:17
I don't even know what this is for.
25:21
Listen, I just feel like we told you all what we wanted, so get some students
25:27
together that aren't us and do it.
25:30
Yeah, I don't know, I was just kinda like, "Okay I guess they're trying." But,
25:39
I just, I don't know, I just wish that
25:45
the university was better at responding to these types of things.
25:52
Rather than letting it boil up into this one big event and then being
25:58
flustered and having no idea what to do.
26:01
Yeah and being like, "Oh gosh."
26:03
So what was the first meeting with Ed Ray like?
26:07
Who was at the table with you?
26:09
How did you feel?
26:10
Yeah!
26:11
So the first meeting with Ed Ray I think was like a week after the Speak Out.
26:18
Was it about a week?
26:23
[off camera confirmation] And it was in his office, there was
26:25
this conference room or whatever.
26:27
We were at the table with Ed Ray.
26:28
There was a lot of people at the table that I don't know who they are.
26:31
Everyone introduced themselves, but to be honest it went by really fast.
26:34
I can't remember the people I never seen before that work in
26:37
all these different offices.
26:38
I was like, "Okay." And so, the meeting was a lot of Ed Ray talking,
26:44
and he seemed very distraught that
26:50
these were the things that were happening at OSU to students of color.
26:56
He acknowledged his privilege.
26:58
He acknowledged that OSU was failing as a university to
27:03
their duty to students of color.
27:05
He sounded really convincing.
27:07
But yeah, that was most of the meeting, was Ed Ray talking, "We've failed as a
27:13
university," a lot of that, he just talks a lot and that was basically all it was.
27:22
Did you have a chance to say anything?
27:25
We did.
27:26
We did.
27:27
I don't remember what we said.
27:28
I know they definitely wanted feedback from us for next steps,
27:32
and they wanted to let us know what they were planning as well.
27:37
So, we definitely did get the chance to speak our piece, but yeah, like I
27:43
said, it was mostly Ed Ray talking.
27:49
Interesting.
27:50
Yeah.
27:52
So how do you think the OSU community, which would include students, staff, and
27:58
faculty, respond [ed] to the Speak Out?
28:01
Did anyone reach out to you in any capacity?
28:05
You mentioned some committees, but...
28:06
Yeah.
28:08
So the OSU community as a whole?
28:13
Yeah
28:18
[Laughs] okay that was like a lot!
28:19
So definitely, I think that what always happens when we have protests or any
28:26
type of demonstrations on campus, there is people that are like, "Okay, I don't
28:31
understand what this is about." Like there was that livestream and people
28:33
were just trolling the whole entire time.
28:36
Somebody had made a video.
28:38
I think it's still on YouTube.
28:40
Somebody had made a video talking about how we were being racist.
28:44
They were recording us at the Speak Out and were just like... I don't know, I
28:48
don't even know what the video was even called but it was trying to expose us
28:53
for being racist, or something like that.
28:54
It was the most ridiculous thing that I've ever seen.
28:59
And so, there was definitely a lot of negative responses that we got, which
29:03
we anticipated because we're in Oregon,
29:07
of course.
29:07
As far as people reaching out to us, I think that I did personally
29:12
get a lot of people reaching out to me just basically saying, "Oh thank
29:15
you for doing this" or whatever.
29:16
I know that some people wanted to sit down and talk to us.
29:19
The Barometer reached out to us, cause they wanted to write an article on
29:22
it, so we sat down and talked to them.
29:25
But, I mean, other than that, yeah, they were like, I got a
29:30
couple people reaching out to me wanting me to serve on committees.
29:33
I know that I got asked to be on leadership counsel or
29:36
something stuff like that.
29:38
So yeah, that's kind of what happened afterward, I don't know
29:43
just things that I kind of expected, nothing that was surprising.
29:48
And what was going on with the livestream?
29:51
Yeah.
29:51
There was, the event was being livestreamed online
29:59
[laughs] so anybody could watch
30:03
it.
30:03
[video cuts]
30:03
Could you clarify what was happening with the livestream?
30:07
Yeah.
30:08
So, what was going on with the livestream was that the Speak Out
30:13
was being livestreamed online.
30:17
And anybody could view it from anywhere.
30:20
It was completely accessible to everybody.
30:22
And
30:24
with the livestream, there was a chat that was going on, and there
30:25
were people in the chat who were
30:31
just being extremely racist and trolling, and it was getting
30:37
out of control, I think.
30:39
I personally did not go on and read the livestream because I could not do it.
30:46
I know that some students who were at the Speak Out were doing that, and some
30:50
students at the Speak Out literally who would get up to speak were like,
30:55
"This is going on in the livechat right now, and this is exactly what we're
30:58
talking about." And they would say things that were being said on livechat.
31:04
And so, it got to the point where it was getting out of control, so the live chat
31:10
was shut down during the event.
31:13
I don't know if the livestream itself got restricted to only OSU
31:19
students, but I know that definitely the livechat had to get shut down.
31:25
Okay, thank you for clarifying.
31:27
Mmhmm [in the affirmative]
31:29
So, this event took place almost two years ago, correct?
31:33
Yes.
31:35
The university has since then increased their efforts to
31:38
create a more inclusive campus.
31:40
Do you think that they are taking the right steps to meet the demands made
31:43
by the students at the Speak Out?
31:45
No.
31:47
[Laughs] No, not really.
31:50
I think that, I don't know, I feel like campus is exactly the same than before.
31:57
I mean they did create a whole entire new office, with new positions.
32:04
I don't really know what that new office is doing or what
32:07
the people there are doing.
32:10
They still have those committees; I don't know what the committees are doing.
32:14
I don't know what's going on.
32:15
I
32:17
just, I literally have no clue.
32:21
So, my answer to that is, I don't know, I feel like they could be
32:25
doing more than they are, and
32:29
yeah.
32:30
I just feel like it's one of those things that's like when it happened
32:32
the university was like, "Oh crap!
32:34
We gotta change this and make this happen" but then a couple years later
32:39
it's just kinda like, "Oh, whatever."
32:43
So, I take it that the university has not followed up with you in any capacity.
32:48
Mmm Mmm [in the negative]
32:49
Like, "Here's an update!"
32:50
No.
32:52
Wow.
32:54
[laughs] And it sounds like also that some of these things that were
32:58
supposed to happen maybe fell through?
33:01
Mmhmm [in the affirmative]
33:03
And how does that make you feel?
33:06
To be honest, I'm really not surprised.
33:08
I'm just kinda like, "Okay." This is, I didn't really have huge expectations
33:15
going into it, like yeah this is a list of demands that we had but being
33:20
realistic, I mean, we're at Oregon State.
33:25
I just don't think that the administration has the capacity to
33:31
follow through with the things that we are wanting and we're needing.
33:37
And, so, I mean to be honest, it really sucks.
33:42
But yeah, I just,
33:46
I don't know.
33:47
I mean, I hate to say, "It is what it is," but I don't know.
33:53
Like I said, it's not really a surprise, but it's not acceptable at the same time.
34:02
Do you feel that the university is, I mean this is kind of a similar question.
34:10
So, they're not addressing the needs that were brought up in the Speak Out directly.
34:17
In your opinion, what else could they be doing?
34:20
I just, well first and foremost, I feel like they could be more transparent
34:25
in what they're actually working towards, because I have no idea
34:33
what's going on.
34:34
You know, afterwards, people were coming up to us and they were like,
34:35
"What's going on with the university?
34:35
Or "Have they said anything to you?" and I'm just like "No, I don't know what
34:38
they're doing." So I think that being more transparent is really important.
34:43
I know that also there were town halls that were happening, earlier in the...I
34:49
don't know what happened with that.
34:51
I don't know, I just feel like, I just need more from them.
34:56
I need them to communicate, and I also want more spaces where
35:02
student voices can be heard, because I don't, I just feel like,
35:10
we had the Speak Out and that happened that one time where we sat
35:13
down with the administration but after that it was like nobody has
35:20
any contact or is speaking to them.
35:23
So, I think that before anything, I just think there needs to be a line
35:27
of communication, or these people need to be easier to access than they are.
35:31
Because like I said, I don't know what's going on, and that's kinda not okay, so.
35:40
So, I mean, you kind of already answered this, but after everything you just
35:45
mentioned, what do you think the current campus climate is, and is it different
35:50
in any way than it was two years ago?
35:53
Yeah, no.
35:54
I [Laughs] , yeah I just,
35:59
yeah, OSU, like I said earlier, really caters to their one white
36:05
population of students, and it isn't really accessible to anybody else.
36:11
So yeah, I don't feel like there really was a change in the campus climate, which
36:16
is really unfortunate, because I feel like students of color really do a lot of work.
36:19
Not just us, but every day, you know, to make a change on campus,
36:25
and to try and make OSU a more
36:33
welcoming?
36:34
Or just safer to walk around, you know, so students of color don't have
36:39
to walk around on edge all the time.
36:44
It's like all this hard work and all of this effort that we're putting, all of the
36:47
time, it just kinda makes it seem like, "Wow, is this even worth it?" Because
36:54
literally nothing, nothing changed.
36:57
I still feel the same way that I did when I first got here.
37:00
So
37:02
yeah, it kind sucks or it really sucks, but yeah.
37:06
The campus climate definitely is the same.
37:10
So, the final question, I'm gonna just state it because you've already answered
37:15
it, but: Since the Speak Out, do you think the administration has created
37:18
better avenues for students of color to have a platform to express their
37:21
needs and concerns and also have a role in the decision making process?
37:28
And that sounds like that is a "no."
37:29
Yeah, sounds like it's a no.
37:31
I think that they did have a really good idea with the town
37:36
halls, but it just wasn't right.
37:42
I don't know but yeah, my answer would be no.
37:49
I mean this is kind of just an add on question but, do you think
37:54
students of color want to be involved in decision making processes, or?
37:58
Oh, most definitely.
38:00
Most definitely.
38:01
100%
38:02
And obviously you mentioned more transparency, more
38:08
direct lines of communication.
38:11
Mmmhmm [in the affirmative] , yeah, yeah.
38:13
Because not only, yeah, I just feel like nobody really knows what the
38:17
university is doing or nobody really knows what the university has plans to do.
38:21
I just think that it's a problem.
38:23
We walk around here every day; we're paying the student fees.
38:26
At least we should know what's up, or what's going on.
38:29
And these things that we want, and these changes that were asking to be made, I
38:34
just feel like, "Are we planning to do this?" I don't know, I just feel like we
38:39
need answers that were just not getting.
38:44
So, I mean that's all that, I mean not all that we want, but it's just kind
38:49
of the first step to making a change.
38:51
There has to be that communication.
38:53
There has to be that transparency.
38:55
Like the community development.
38:57
Yeah.
38:57
Yeah.
38:58
Yeah.
38:58
Not Separation.
39:00
Yeah.
39:01
So, that's all the questions that I have for you, but I guess I do want
39:07
to let you have time to say what other closing thoughts you might have.
39:13
Since this is your oral history, so.
39:15
Yeah, Okay.
39:17
I don't know, I don't really have much to say, but in my experience
39:25
here I would say that I did not plan to do as much as I did at OSU.
39:30
When I first came here I just kind of was just like, "I'm gonna do what
39:33
I need to do and then I'm just gonna graduate and get out of here." I did
39:36
end up getting really involved and I encourage everybody to do the same.
39:40
I don't know who's gonna watch this, but anyway, I encourage
39:41
everybody to do the same.
39:41
And yeah, I don't know, I think that's it.
39:46
Like I said, wasn't really,
39:52
just kind of was surprised at how much, I would say how much I've done, and
40:00
how much someone can do in a few years.
40:04
Even though the university kind of sucks on their response side
40:16
[laughs] , I really appreciate all the people I've met, all the students of color
40:21
that I've met, all of the faculty of color that I've met, and I appreciate them,
40:24
and all the work and all the labor that they continue to put in every single day.
40:30
Do you have any advice for future students who might be watching this video?
40:35
I would say
40:40
get involved.
40:41
That's number one, get involved.
40:43
And number two, don't give up or get discouraged.
40:46
It's really easy to do that with social justice work, especially
40:49
if you don't see change happening, but, I mean, I would say don't let
40:56
that stop you from doing anything.
41:00
Also, to know your resources on campus.
41:03
Know who's there for you.
41:06
And also, that selfcare is really important.
41:12
Take care of yourself first and foremost before you do anything, you know?
41:16
Don't burn yourself out, because I know especially students who are involved in
41:20
social justice put a lot more on their plate than they can handle and overbook
41:25
themselves and all of these things.
41:27
But your physical, mental, spiritual wellbeing comes
41:31
before any of this, anything.
41:33
So that's
41:36
what I say.
41:37
Well thank you so much for providing your oral history.
41:41
I know it does not entail every complexity of your life, but I really appreciate it.
41:48
Thank you!
41:48
I appreciate you doing this.
