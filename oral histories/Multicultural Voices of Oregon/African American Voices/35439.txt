00:00
Can you please tell us your name and the date you were born and
00:05
where we are sitting right now?
00:08
Yes.
00:09
I’m Charmaine Coleman.
00:12
I was born March 23, 1936,
00:19
and we are sitting in my home in Eugene, Oregon, right now.
00:26
Okay for this interview, we’re mainly interested in your life that you have
00:34
spent here in Oregon, but I think in order to really understand fully
00:39
somebody’s life it’s a good idea to have an idea about where you came from.
00:44
Mm-hmm.
00:46
Can you give us some of your background?
00:48
Where you were born?
00:49
What your family that you grew up in was like?
00:54
Who raised you?
00:56
Who you were with?
00:57
Sure, sure.
00:59
Well, my family roots started with my father’s
01:06
father, who’s my grandfather, in Thibodaux, Louisiana.
01:12
I like to start with Grandpa, because he set the tone for the family, because
01:22
my mother’s father was a railroad man and was out of the state, you
01:28
know, he was not there all the time.
01:31
My father’s father was in town and took over as the patriarch of as
01:39
many of them as would allow him
01:44
[laughs] . His roots were
01:49
coming from the island, Caribbean.
01:52
His mother’s mother
02:01
had immigrated to Thibodaux, because my understanding is there is a shipyard,
02:12
or dock, or there’s the port and there were sailors who came into Louisiana to
02:21
do things, you know to work or whatever.
02:25
My grandfather was a product of one of the sailors, one of the white sailors,
02:32
and my Caribbean grandmother, who
02:37
was Catholic and Black.
02:42
She did not come as a slave.
02:45
She came, but she came doing that kind of work for people.
02:52
When she became pregnant with my grandfather, she could not
02:59
drag a biracial child around in Louisiana in that time and era.
03:05
I mean, there was a lot of mixing going on, but it wasn’t in the open.
03:11
So, my grandfather, my paternal grandfather, the patriarch, or the leader
03:17
of this group was raised by the Catholic nuns at the orphanage that was there.
03:27
That’s where my history starts, I feel, because Grandpa was raised fully until
03:36
he became a young adult and then they sent him to training school and he
03:42
came away with whatever it was in that day and age a degree, or a something.
03:50
He was a carpenter.
03:53
He was trained in that skill, and that’s where my history is.
04:03
My mother’s side of the family was mixed with Choctaw, coming from Oklahoma.
04:11
They ended up in Houston, Texas.
04:16
My mother’s father, my mother’s mother was part of the Choctaw group
04:23
and her father was from Trinidad.
04:29
So, I go on to say all of this to say that we were a part of, I don’t know
04:37
that there’s a name for it, but I’m looking for that portion of information
04:43
because there were a lot of Black people in those days, and especially in
04:50
those areas, where there were ports and people coming in and coming in and out.
04:58
My mother’s father left Trinidad to come to Houston.
05:04
I don’t know much about that, but out of all of this our family was very
05:14
productive because they had those grandfathers who had come from different
05:22
backgrounds that was not heaped in the oppression and the racial issues
05:32
because they were not involved in that.
05:35
You know, their upbringing was open.
05:40
Most of the nuns at the orphanage were from Europe over here doing their work,
05:47
so there was no—so, the family was greatly advantaged from the beginning, and I give
05:57
all of that the credit my grandfather’s, the credit for having the skill and
06:07
the resources that I’ve ended up with.
06:12
That is a very, it’s a difficult thing to talk about, because so many African
06:20
American people, I believe, don’t really know the depth of their history.
06:29
We’ve had our tensions among each other, because there were all of those
06:36
different levels during that time.
06:41
There’s even a film made that I watched at church, and we became Catholic,
06:51
that is called The Courage to Love.
06:52
It was during an era where in Louisiana in particular, I don’t know a city,
07:01
not necessarily New Orleans [that’s the one we hear about], where white
07:07
men who had immigrated from France in particular were in large numbers in
07:15
that area and the style was to have two families: a white family and another
07:26
family made up of a young Black woman, and to take good care of these families.
07:36
That film is so, it was so revealing to me about my family, because as a young person
07:48
it was so confusing when I was around.
07:52
We lived in Oakland.
07:54
We moved from Houston to Oakland during the war and that’s where, as a young
08:01
child, the kind of issues started to come forth, because now that, in retrospect
08:09
I look back at it and what my mother and dad were always trying to tell us, it
08:15
was not that we were better or superior, but they didn’t know how to put it.
08:21
They didn’t say: you probably come from a different background than a lot of the
08:26
other African American children in the neighborhood, because when we got there
08:32
the only housing was public housing.
08:36
We were just mixed in.
08:37
All the Black people were in one part of the neighborhood, and the
08:41
Japanese who had been interned were in another neighborhood and then the
08:46
other people were, white people, were in another part of the neighborhood.
08:54
That’s when it all started coming to me, when you’re trying
08:58
to make friends, you know.
09:01
It didn’t work a lot for me and my brother.
09:05
That’s what it was.
09:07
I didn’t really put those pieces together for a long time until I was
09:11
old enough to recognize what it was.
09:18
I want that to be, I really need to have that be a part of my history, because
09:27
it has been both an advantage and then a little bit of a flaw in my upbringing
09:40
because I realize now why there are just some gaps in my relationships
09:50
with many other Black people.
09:54
I’m mature enough to not allow that to enter, but a person’s history really can
10:02
have a lot to do with, well, everything.
10:08
Can you give us some concrete examples of how that has influenced relationships?
10:14
Well, yes, I’ll give you one that I think will be very valuable in this interview.
10:22
Mine and Ed’s coming to Eugene, a virtually all-White community,
10:30
has been,
10:34
I wouldn’t say perfect, but none of the racism or the
10:43
culturation, or whatever you call it of Eugene has had any effect on us.
10:48
I do believe that it’s due to our backgrounds.
10:52
You see, Ed had a similar background where his mother was a product of the
11:00
man who owned the large house up front.
11:05
His grandmother, Grandma Sally, was taken in by that family, given a little shack
11:15
in the back, and that’s where she lived.
11:19
Now, it was sometime after slavery had ended.
11:23
She had been part of something which was also part of the disruption
11:30
of families when slavery ended, and she ended up there as a young
11:35
lady with no home or no anything.
11:39
By that man, she had three children, one of whom was Ed’s mother.
11:47
The advantage of that for Ed’s mother was that that man took good care of them.
11:56
They were never subjected to the oppression, the sadness, and the
12:02
ugly, ugly history of slavery because they lived on his property.
12:07
His wife always felt that the children of Sally’s were her sons,
12:17
but they, in fact, were her husband’s.
12:20
It was during that era that I was talking about, where White men, it
12:25
was just a condition where very many of them—I don’t know whether it had
12:31
to do with wealth or, I don’t know.
12:36
I wish I had a name for it.
12:38
It’s really is a troublesome issue among Black people because you see, we
12:45
still bear some of that old, old history of the lighter skin is better and the
12:54
hair texture, you know, is important.
12:58
We still have a little bit of that left.
13:01
It’s kind of sad, but it’s because of that history.
13:05
Eddie’s mother was very fair-skin.
13:09
I mean, that man was Italian.
13:13
He had a bunch of children by his wife, but he took good care of them.
13:17
I mean, we have a picture of them in the hall and they are dressed
13:23
like, well-dressed, those children.
13:29
We’ll have to see that picture.
13:30
Tell us who Ed is for the purpose of the interview.
13:33
Ed is my deceased husband.
13:38
He passed away a year and a half ago.
13:41
We moved to Eugene together so that he could
13:47
start and finish his Ph.D. He had a master’s degree and
13:52
was teaching at Chico State.
13:55
We took this position here because it was a good offer
14:00
and they had a good department.
14:02
He wanted to do theater and communication.
14:07
Having been a musician in the bay area with some fine groups, he
14:13
had that artistic bent about him.
14:17
We chose this school.
14:19
Another reason, very important reason, was it was closer to get to the mothers.
14:25
We had a 3-year-old, so [laughs] , that was another reason.
14:32
As I was saying, but our time here in Eugene hasn’t been like a Disneyland or
14:39
anything, but because of our background of knowing what we knew about our people,
14:49
because I must give our folks credit.
14:52
They never tried to hide the ugly, the bad and the ugly, but they were fortunate
15:03
because by the time I came along, you know my grandfather had a business.
15:09
They all had a house with indoor toilets.
15:13
So, I never, none of them were part of that oppressive slavery because of
15:22
their immigration into this country and their circumstances were different.
15:27
But, they certainly were enlightened.
15:29
They knew.
15:33
But it was totally a—it was a resource that was passed onto me.
15:42
I give that the credit for my lack of insecurity with Eugene being all-White,
15:54
the university... none of it was ever anything that Ed and I thought
16:01
we couldn’t overcome or live with.
16:05
That, I don’t know how to say that, but I want to say that is so important
16:11
in the history of Black people.
16:14
The reason a town like Eugene could be very, very, not only lacking in
16:23
anything that Black people have the resource to do—for example, there just
16:28
really aren’t that many jobs around here that would suit many Black people.
16:36
I hate to make that sound like a general comment, but had Ed and I not
16:42
been coming here for the university I don’t know what—there would be
16:47
no purpose for us to come here.
16:50
When you say would suit many Black people, what do you mean?
16:54
Well, because we’ve been so left out of life.
17:03
Black people have just really been totally, I would say, totally neglected
17:10
in this country, and we can bring it up to, actually, in the latest terms in which
17:17
we’re talking, Black people have been
17:24
harassed.
17:26
We have been intimidated.
17:29
We have been neglected.
17:31
We have been abused.
17:34
We have been all of those conditions, and it’s only through the miracle
17:43
that my family had of being, what would you say, immigrant, we were
17:55
not a part of that slave history.
18:01
So, we had a little more, you know both grandfathers had a
18:05
little more education than a lot of Black men and their families.
18:12
We were in a different category, and I believe that
18:18
the education is what helped us move through that oppression.
18:26
Understanding where people are coming from
18:31
helps.
18:34
I stayed in Eugene because I totally understand Eugene.
18:41
It’s White.
18:43
It’s small-ish.
18:47
It’s not that well-resourced.
18:53
Even a lot of White people who come here don’t find the kind of
18:59
work, you know it’s not the kind of city that has industrial work.
19:03
It’s backward in its cultural appreciation, even of each other,
19:12
because I find that there are a lot of groups of people—there’s
19:19
a Russian, what’s it called?
19:23
A Russian church?
19:24
A Russian community.
19:27
There’s a Russian community.
19:29
There are a lot of Scandinavian people in this region.
19:36
The racism kind of overshadows everything.
19:42
There probably weren’t as many hard-core racists who came here as there were
19:48
other people, but that kind of mentality sort of spills out into a place.
19:56
Really keeps it, really racism is a detriment to African American people
20:02
and to other people of color, but it’s a detriment to White people.
20:09
It’s keeping everybody behind.
20:14
I know that Eugene could be a much more fabulous place if it were
20:20
more mixed and if there was less of that narrow-mindedness in pockets.
20:29
It’s here.
20:30
I mean, it’s here.
20:33
It just doesn’t rear its ugly head.
20:36
So, Eugene does have that level of sophistication to
20:41
hide it or to cover it up.
20:44
Speaking about rearing its ugly head, I know that last week or a couple
20:52
of weeks ago at Westmoreland Park.
20:56
Yes, that community center.
20:58
The Center was named after your husband.
21:01
My husband, Ed.
21:04
There was graffiti someone put up around here.
21:08
Can you tell me something about that?
21:14
Just as an aside, but my voice is not being recorded.
21:18
Oh, okay.
21:20
I was with Calk, and I came down here last week—
21:23
And did the leaf lining, yes.
21:25
I hadn’t realized that this is where your house was.
21:28
I was on the other side, but I didn’t realize you lived right here.
21:32
Right here, right.
21:33
Could you tell us something about
21:41
what happened and how it affected you?
21:46
Well, first of all,
21:51
I’m a former teacher.
21:55
I come from an educated family, so we’ve always, always known that the
22:05
way to straighten things out and to get people on the right track is through
22:13
your family and through your children.
22:17
Having said that, the officials of the city have spoken with
22:24
me about it, this incident.
22:28
Could you explain the incident?
22:29
The incident was that the center was named, City Council had went through
22:35
legal channels and everything after Ed, my husband, who really was a
22:43
dyed-in-the-wool community worker.
22:46
He wanted wherever he lived and raised his children to be the best.
22:50
He was an educator, so he, Ed tried to do it through educating people, like, you
22:58
know, I don’t want to talk about racism.
23:01
I don’t want to talk about these ignorant people who are still
23:04
practicing it, but I want you to know that it’s not going to end until each
23:10
person takes part in being an equal part of everything that’s going on.
23:18
The only way we can teach that is through our children.
23:21
We have to teach our children that they’re okay on this earth.
23:25
You may not have everything that everybody else has.
23:30
To me, that’s where racism is being held onto, is we are too, people in this
23:38
country in particular, have emphasized too much of the worldly kind of stuff.
23:47
It’s easy, racism is so easy, to do to get back at the world when
23:55
you don’t have all of that stuff.
23:59
It’s a bunch of neediness
24:04
that rules that racism, people that don’t feel that they’re accepted and part of it.
24:13
I’ve been told that these were young people just going around with a spray can.
24:19
I don’t know.
24:21
But they did spray a sign that I can see from my house with a Nazi swastika.
24:30
Well, we all know that’s illegal.
24:31
It’s illegal to go around doing that, but that’s probably why I
24:35
believe that they were young kids.
24:37
But, older people do that, too.
24:39
They don’t know.
24:40
I any case, that kind of, what do you call that kind of behavior?
24:50
is coming out of those people’s insecurity and un-involvement in
25:00
what’s positive about this country.
25:04
Ed and I, a long time ago, as kids were taught our importance.
25:09
So, I’m putting this in that spectrum that
25:19
we Black people are tired of coping with it.
25:23
We’re stick of it.
25:25
We want to get on with our lives, but it’s still out here.
25:33
It holds us back, but it’s also holding those people back who perpetrated.
25:38
I don’t know what to do about it.
25:42
I don’t know how to feel about it, because even though I can cope with Eugene and
25:49
understand and I’m an older person.
25:51
I know my limits.
25:54
I know when people are in my business, and I know my right here on this planet.
26:02
It’s
26:05
maturity that kept Ed and me here in Eugene.
26:10
It’s a maturity about who you are, where you fit in the
26:13
world, and what your rights are.
26:16
In terms of what happened here, how much graffiti was actually done?
26:22
Well, I was told, I didn’t see it because I did get in my car and drive
26:27
back around the Boys & Girls Club, but I guess the city or whoever runs,
26:35
one thing about city business is I don’t understand how a city works.
26:42
I don’t understand who they work for, because that kind of stuff.
26:47
That sign outside of my door is just painted over.
26:51
It wasn’t taken down or repainted or anything.
26:55
It’s still quite ugly, I think.
26:57
I’ve talked to city officials about it.
26:59
My understanding is they got right on it and repainted or removed or
27:05
something the Boys & Girls signs that were graffitied, but I don’t
27:10
know how much of that was done.
27:12
That is my issue now.
27:15
I spoke to the city people who have contacted me.
27:18
One of the officers came here and sat and said we have patrols out here, because
27:23
that’s not the first time we’ve had anything sprayed on our fence, but in
27:30
that context we do believe that it was affiliated with that being named after Ed.
27:36
How can you think anything else?
27:39
But then, Eugene, in Eugene I think people are so comfortable and so busy
27:48
just trying to make their lives work that,
27:54
and inexperienced—I find a lot of people come here and wherever they come from
28:03
they bring a “whew, boy I can breathe in this place.” Because I don’t think
28:09
racism is just the worst thing that Black people face or any people face.
28:17
White people don’t treat each other with kindness or care or
28:23
courage, and it’s all kind of mushy.
28:31
Let’s get back more now directly to your own life and experiences.
28:40
You’ve had quite a lot of education.
28:43
Can you tell us something about your own education?
28:48
Oh, my own education was coming from my mother’s father’s grandfather’s
28:57
from their interpretation.
29:00
So, I’ll tell you about my education.
29:03
When we were in Houston,
29:07
I was only 6 when we left Houston.
29:10
The schools,
29:13
I mean, the neighborhood that we lived in had Black schools.
29:17
They were all-Black.
29:19
The teachers were very dedicated, very dedicated.
29:25
You see, this is what I’m trying to discern, is that my whole background
29:34
as I know it, the only thing they knew would help them escape from this
29:43
oppression and this mess was through education, so that neighborhood that
29:48
we lived in, it was middle-class Black.
29:51
We had sidewalks, we had—now, there were other parts of Houston where,
29:56
you know, Black people were living
30:00
disheveled and very low-income or whatever that is.
30:05
The schools
30:08
were excellent as the neighborhood was as excellent because that
30:18
neighborhood was filled with middle-class, educated Black people.
30:25
You might say that in many, many places in this country there have always been
30:32
neighborhoods of educated Black people.
30:38
I believe that we’ve lost that edge to our lives.
30:44
I think the war had a lot to do with it, the disruption, families moving from
30:50
place to place trying to get another job.
30:54
Here’s what I say about my education: there was no question that I would
30:59
continue being educated, because my family believed that that was
31:06
the only way out, and, you know, I think they were absolutely true.
31:16
When you are educated,
31:21
you just
31:24
not only does it build your confidence and who you are in this world because
31:30
you’re learning about other people, you’re
31:34
broadening out.
31:35
I think by broadening out, you can only make yourself a more
31:42
comfortable, secure person.
31:46
Am I just rambling on?
31:48
But it’s through education
31:52
that a lot of this happens, or doesn’t happen.
31:55
So, you did your elementary, primary school?
32:00
In California.
32:02
But, mind you, I had the kind of mother who, in that day
32:06
and age, spoke good English.
32:10
This was during the war disruption.
32:12
Those teachers were dealing with all kinds of children leaving the south.
32:18
I can’t even imagine teaching under those circumstances.
32:23
One thing that I had that probably a lot of children may not have
32:28
had in that public arena there was a mother who knew education.
32:36
She knew what this country had set up for—she knew our rights.
32:45
I think that’s another reason coming to Eugene was not unsettling to Ed and me.
32:51
We have always known our rights.
32:56
So, we were talking about your education.
32:58
Yes.
32:59
So, when you finished high school—?
33:02
I finished high school.
33:05
Now, I have to tell you that because my mother knew the - what do you say?
33:15
- the politics of education or whatever that was, she always felt comfortable
33:23
going to the school to discuss mine and my brother’s education with
33:29
the principal, or whoever she was.
33:31
A lot of young children didn’t have that privilege, because educators
33:39
really do want to do the right thing, I believe, because I was a teacher myself.
33:44
But when, it’s really very true, when a parent takes time and
33:51
really comes to the institution and speaks with those in authority
34:00
in a positive sense, you know, and
34:07
with a conciliatory attitude, it makes a big difference in how that
34:13
child’s education can progress.
34:18
I know as a teacher, I so appreciated parents who came to help.
34:27
I don’t mean volunteer in the classroom, I just mean came with
34:30
a positive attitude about what my role was, and what their role was.
34:37
My mother was that kind of a woman.
34:39
She was very comfortable with that, because there were
34:42
several teachers in her line.
34:44
So,
34:47
there was never any question my brother and I both felt supported
34:52
that if we didn’t do the best that we were doing, my mom would be there.
34:58
She’d be on us, but the school needed to do its part to help us get educated.
35:05
She understood the whole
35:08
process of all the moving and the mixture and the racism and that was the most
35:15
horrible part of my life growing up, was all that—it was really confusing.
35:23
At first, the teacher didn’t have enough chairs in my classroom, so I was sitting,
35:31
and a couple of the other Black students, were sitting on little pieces of carpet.
35:40
I mean, it’s because she didn’t have enough seats, but she had
35:44
us sitting kind of in the back.
35:47
My mother went to school and made a slight fuss about it to the principal.
35:54
She said, I don’t know what your budget is.
35:57
My mom knew all of that stuff.
35:59
She said, I don’t know what your budget is, but you get some
36:03
chairs in here for these children.
36:04
So, was this a mix school?
36:07
This was in Richmond, but remember it was during the war and they had just
36:12
mixed us in in any great numbers.
36:16
They weren’t ready for any of us.
36:21
My mother said, oh no, I will not have her—see, my mother knew the connection
36:28
between my going to school and their getting money for each student.
36:33
That’s something most mothers at that point in time, most Black mothers,
36:38
did not have that kind of background.
36:42
So, she knew the politics.
36:45
She said, oh no.
36:47
They need chairs, and they will not come back to this and I will be going
36:54
to the superintendent of schools.
37:00
That education coming from when they were kids and my grandpa being educated
37:07
by—it’s key to why so many of us Black people aren’t farther ahead,
37:15
because we haven’t known our rights.
37:18
We haven’t known how to tell people, no more of this.
37:23
Then you got to, then I know
37:26
you
37:29
went to university.
37:30
I finished high school in that town, and it was up the hill, the line
37:41
had been gerrymandered to exclude us low-income, low-class White
37:48
folks and low-class Black folks.
37:52
My grandfather, because he was a builder,
37:57
he found it out and investigated, and there was a whole section of Black
38:02
kids who were supposed to be going to the school on the hill, which was far
38:09
superior from the school over here.
38:15
All of those kinds of things, we, Black people, we’ve been
38:20
tossed around and messed around.
38:23
I guess what I’m saying is the difference between anything that I do or say has to
38:28
do with the fact that I come from a very seriously well-educated background and so,
38:36
you know, we’ve suffered some oppression but because we’ve known our rights
38:41
we’ve been able to navigate the course.
38:44
I went to college at University of the Pacific in Stockton.
38:50
I got some monies because I also was a very gifted signer, little kid.
38:58
And the priest at our church is the one who pushed my career.
39:05
He was from Hollywood.
39:06
He was not one of those priests who practiced any
39:10
kind of oppression or racism.
39:13
He was very well-educated himself.
39:17
He saw the talent, and so he started getting my, you might say, he
39:23
was my manager [laughs] , getting me little gigs here and there.
39:28
That’s why I say I’ve been a professional singer since I was 12,
39:32
because these were paid, because he realized my folks needed the money.
39:36
I would sing for the Irishmen’s Club, these monied Irish men,
39:44
they had a club.
39:45
The country club—I had a career when I was a kid, and that also boosted my
39:52
confidence, helped my mom and dad, because they’d been used to that in Houston.
39:58
That’s why Greg says, if you wanted me to wear a formal to this interview,
40:03
I have one in there [laughs] . I graduated from the University of
40:08
the Pacific, not in music, though, because that’s where the racism started
40:20
being apparent again.
40:21
I was one of 5 Black women on campus.
40:25
The other four were on scholarship.
40:28
I was not.
40:31
There were only Black men on campus, and they were all on the football team.
40:37
That’s when the racism, for me, was just—but, it just, it makes you tough.
40:49
Without that background that I had I wouldn’t have been tough enough
40:52
to stay there, because racism—
40:55
So, give me some concrete examples.
40:59
Of the racism on that campus?
41:01
What you actually experienced.
41:02
Well,
41:05
I didn’t have a roommate in the dorm.
41:08
Now, you know my dad and mom are paying the tuition.
41:11
It’s the same tuition as a White girl’s.
41:13
I didn’t have a roommate for weeks, and the claim was my mother—my
41:22
mother always suspected that people were lying about something.
41:28
So, she wondered why I didn’t have a roommate.
41:31
She felt that that was an important part of my college, is not being isolated.
41:37
She felt that it had something to do, a racial component to it.
41:40
Well, it did, when we finally got down to it.
41:44
The roommate [it backfired, though], the roommate that I got was a girl
41:49
from Hawaii [air quote gesture] . She was as White as the driven snow.
41:55
She was, what do you call it?
41:57
White.
41:58
From Hawaii.
41:59
Her folks had moved there to do some work or something [laughs] . She
42:04
never stayed in that room with me.
42:08
That kind of stuff existed in that dorm.
42:12
The house mother herself was intentionally off-handed to me.
42:20
I mean, I was, you know, 18 or 19.
42:23
I knew what kindness was and I didn’t see her behaving that way with other girls.
42:30
That kind of stuff.
42:32
That campus was Methodist-owned,
42:40
and yet there was that kind of racism on it.
42:45
I had my good friend, Mona, who tested the system.
42:50
She signed up to join a sorority.
42:54
She had the grades.
42:55
She had everything for it, and they—she couldn’t pass any of those
43:03
silly tests, like whatever it is: walk around the block 6 times.
43:08
We knew it was silliness.
43:10
That kind of racism was on that campus.
43:13
To this day, that is the one place that I cannot stand to think about.
43:20
I mean, it wasn’t horrible, you know?
43:24
But it was me.
43:27
The singer—I thought I was pretty hot stuff, and I was of value to that campus,
43:35
and racism was, well, it's a slap in the face of anybody’s face, but to me?
43:42
Who had been taught that, well, I hadn’t been taught that I was privileged,
43:49
but I hadn’t ever thought of them not giving me a roommate, you know?
43:56
That kind of stuff.
43:58
So, now let’s jump to the University of Oregon.
44:03
To Eugene.
44:04
To Eugene, and since we’re on the subject of education, let’s think
44:10
about, tell us about your educational experience at the University of Oregon.
44:17
Of Oregon?
44:19
Well, by the time
44:25
Ed got finished with those people over there, what I mean was he
44:30
was one of few professors, and the university is such that
44:40
it has a reputation that it’s an educational institution.
44:45
So, the racism that you would find on campus is so undercover and
44:54
so entrenched in intellectualism, that you’d have to have a
45:01
fine-toothed comb to really nail it.
45:04
What year did you?
45:06
We came here in 1966.
45:09
Okay, and what year did you go to the university?
45:12
In the ‘70s: 1972/’73, I went.
45:20
Ed was teaching there all that time.
45:23
My going there, I wasn’t living on campus, so I didn’t have that foolishness
45:28
to put up with, but I did suffer some, what I call, some deep kinds
45:37
of neglect because of my Blackness.
45:43
Give some examples.
45:45
Concrete examples.
45:46
I was admitted
45:50
as a returning student.
45:55
A house, no,
46:00
it had a title, but there were professors on the campus who did not
46:06
have any of that kind of attitudes.
46:09
So, Dick Schminke [?] , he was a good friend of ours, was teaching
46:13
in the education department.
46:16
He helped me write up an application, and I was granted a stipend
46:24
in the special ed department.
46:31
I faced deep, deep racism in that department.
46:40
So, I won’t say that it was departmental necessarily, but it was at the
46:46
university they played the game of
46:53
finding the person who they think is more deserving of the stipend based on
47:04
what university they came from, which one they’re trying to get to.
47:08
It’s all that university kind of elitism.
47:14
We don’t call it racism, but it’s there.
47:18
It’s still there.
47:19
It’s entrenched in there.
47:24
For example, the university has not mentioned for about a year now how much
47:33
time and effort Ed put into not just his field but into fields Upward Bound, all
47:41
of the programs that we’re serving, not third-world people but minority students.
47:48
Ed worked tirelessly on those committees.
47:52
Boy, the racism there was just deep and ugly.
47:56
The incident that I had was with the special ed department.
48:03
It was that they would always avoid my kind of query into any anything.
48:15
It was almost as if I was invisible.
48:18
I can’t remember what things I was asking about.
48:23
I entered with a stipulation that because I was a returning student,
48:31
had not been in undergrad work for 20, 30 years, some of the demands of a
48:42
graduate program may be such that I would require extra tutelage or extra time.
48:57
Now, that was in the contract that I signed.
49:00
Somehow, though, when it came to taking my test for that degree, the people who
49:12
were administering it, and I know this to be a fact, could have cared less.
49:19
It’s like, I got nothing special.
49:23
Not special, but for my needs, because I didn’t come through a program in high
49:29
school where they taught us how to write.
49:34
I didn’t.
49:35
Well, no.
49:37
Let’s put it this way: my premise to the university was I was my—the Black
49:44
students, see there’s no proof of it, Black students in that elitist high school
49:51
were kept out of those classes, those college preparatory classes, because they
49:58
had no hope that we were going to go on.
50:00
I do remember my mother going to the high school and having a very extended
50:06
conversation with the principal about the fact that the French teacher told her
50:13
that he wouldn’t teach my brother in the French class because we had thick lips
50:23
and we couldn’t speak a foreign language.
50:29
My mother went ballistic.
50:34
But, that kind—you see that kind of stuff.
50:36
What happened here at the university was, I get to the people who
50:42
were administering the test.
50:44
They did not look at that portion that said she needs this and she
50:52
needs this because her writing background, she was left out of it.
51:00
I know that Dick Schminke [?] , the one who helped me get that
51:06
stipend, he knew his business.
51:09
He wrote, on my behalf, because he was my advisor, on my behalf
51:16
this is not the agreement that she came into this department under.
51:23
She came in this department under the stipulation that the writing
51:29
of a comprehensive would be modified to a specific level of her
51:39
learning, or something like that.
51:41
[Shakes head] I failed it.
51:43
They failed it.
51:46
By then, I didn’t know whether they failed it because we made a fuss
51:49
about it, or that—well, it was clearly my writing that was not up to the
51:56
level of most of the other people.
52:00
I went to war with them.
52:05
It was—
52:10
Did you have, within the classes, then, it sounded like in the beginning
52:15
within that agreement that there were supposed to be some special tutoring, or?
52:22
Yes.
52:24
Some with my classes.
52:28
If I was having difficulty taking the notes or anything, I would go to Dick,
52:36
the man who helped me get—and he was my backup.
52:41
He would analyze what the problem was.
52:47
What was he saying in the lecture?
52:50
There were some lectures that I just—and of course, to add to it, I became
52:56
very, very, very emotionally upset.
53:03
From that point on, my reading, my studying, everything
53:08
was just in the toilet.
53:10
So,
53:13
I did not get it, that degree.
53:18
But Dick kept working on it, and got me readmitted to the special ed
53:24
department with that stipulation, that my
53:34
paper would be a verbal
53:40
paper with
53:44
him, and some of the special ed people, because she can articulate the information
53:51
back but her writing skills, you know.
53:55
So, I did go back and at that point, Judy Dunlop was head of special ed
54:01
department, and she took it from a woman’s point of view, where women have
54:09
suffered some of the same kinds of stuff.
54:13
She was right on it.
54:15
I did get the degree.
54:17
I got my little piece of paper.
54:20
Was it based on the oral?
54:22
Yes.
54:23
Oral test?
54:23
Yes.
54:24
I gave them the information, the answers to the question, orally, and passed
54:30
it, because my articulation—you know,
54:36
I can talk about a million things, but I did not have the kind of writing skills
54:42
that they were requiring that is...
54:48
how can I put this?
54:50
There are so many levels of deceit that go on in this country all over the place,
55:04
and Black people have been deceived.
55:07
We have been misled with that language.
55:13
Because you see, every department, every structure, every mechanic shop,
55:19
every McDonald’s has their language.
55:23
It’s an inside kind of thing, and it’s regional, too.
55:30
You can’t just come from Texas being Black, not educated, and get a job
55:36
at McDonald’s, probably, because you don’t know the McDonald’s language.
55:43
That’s how deep racism and prejudice really is, and it’s not just us
55:50
Black people but White people are prejudiced, segregated against, too.
55:54
So, then, you got your master’s degree.
55:57
At U of O.
55:58
At the U of O.
55:59
Special Ed.
55:59
In terms of your relation with the other students, was that?
56:08
What was it?
56:09
Did you have any social relations with students?
56:10
With students?
56:11
Also, you were older and you were the wife of a professor, so
56:17
you had another level of social.
56:18
Something to do, right.
56:21
We can talk about that separately, but in terms of your relation
56:24
to students, yourself, your own.
56:28
There were two students who I could go to, or who I could
56:35
talk to, about school stuff.
56:38
Two.
56:39
Pat Glassow [?] was, had been a teacher in the district, and I don’t
56:46
know what Pat’s background was but we got along really well and there was
56:50
nothing she wouldn’t help me with.
56:54
But, of course, she had her full load.
56:56
I remember Pat not knowing that what I was really suffering from was neglect
57:03
of the system that I had signed up with.
57:07
But, she was really, really, really helpful and then there was one
57:13
other student who I could talk to.
57:15
I’m saying this because other than that, any other students that
57:20
I tried to have a relationship with, to talk class [shakes head]
57:28
. White students would not share.
57:32
Now, I don’t know whether they treat each other that way, but I certainly saw it.
57:40
But the two friends you had, were they White or Black?
57:44
Well, Pat was—well, you know, like I said, I don’t know what your background
57:48
really was, but she’d been a teacher.
57:50
She probably understood some of the struggle I was having as a
57:54
returning student and all of that.
57:58
She was beyond any kind of racial necessity to not talk to me, because
58:04
she, you know, the other students were young and felt threatened
58:09
to give out information to me.
58:13
I don’t know what their fear—maybe their fear was that
58:15
I knew something or I was a spy.
58:17
I don’t know [laughs] , but they were not friendly.
58:21
My sons, my oldest son, had that same problem, because he’s big
58:28
and he said one of his professors referred to him as, well, you jocks.
58:35
He went to her and said, I’m not a football player.
58:37
I’m not on the team.
58:39
My dad and mom are paying my tuition.
58:42
You can’t treat me like this.
58:44
She pretended not to know what he was talking about.
58:48
That’s what happened to him.
58:50
No, the other students that I would, you know, sit next
58:55
to or talk to, not friendly.
58:57
Not friendly.
58:59
Very protective of whatever.
59:02
After you got your master’s degree, and that was in special ed.
59:08
Mm-hmm [nods]
59:10
. Then was it then that you went to look for work?
59:13
Well, Dick Schminke [?] , who is still living, he’s 88, 89.
59:19
We still talk on the phone.
59:21
I give him credit for being one of the best people I’ve ever
59:24
met in my life, except my dad and my grandpa and those men.
59:29
Dick
59:32
wrote letters to 4J on my behalf.
59:38
I had that as an advantage, and I had George Russell, who, at that point,
59:44
was human resources director, just the year that I was looking for a job.
59:50
Now, I’m not saying those two got me the job, but without those two
59:59
they would have been looking at me as just another woman that age, you
1:00:02
know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1:00:05
But because Dick wrote those letters about my competence as a teacher, and Dick was
1:00:13
even able to—Dick can sell honey to a bee.
1:00:20
I mean, and he knows his stuff.
1:00:22
He went to 4J and got me into the classroom as a, what do you call it,
1:00:31
when you’re doing your practice teaching?
1:00:35
Well, practice teaching.
1:00:37
He got me into the classroom.
1:00:38
Usually, you have to spend 2 years or so taking classes, because he knew that
1:00:45
I knew how to teach, that I was mature.
1:00:48
He got me in there before I took any of those classes.
1:00:51
That’s unheard of.
1:00:53
But he said here is a mature woman who has, comes from an education
1:00:58
background, blah, blah, blah.
1:01:00
I was student teaching at Washington School before I took any of those
1:01:06
elementary courses, which were pathetic.
1:01:10
I’m still on a committee that still fights with that education school
1:01:19
[shakes head] . It’s about color.
1:01:21
The students of color just know that they’re just not
1:01:26
getting what they deserve.
1:01:29
Are you talking about at the university?
1:01:33
[Nods] Right now.
1:01:34
Right as we speak.
1:01:36
I’m on an ongoing committee of educators who try to interface with the education
1:01:47
administ—you know, that level up there.
1:01:49
Because students will come to us and complain.
1:01:55
So, are you finding that students of color better going to the, graduating
1:02:03
from the high school in Eugene who come into the University of Oregon, are not
1:02:10
being well-prepared in the schools, or?
1:02:15
Well, no, but let me see if I can put this—I’ll try to put it, well,
1:02:24
I don’t have to be nice on here.
1:02:27
The university is an entity all in itself,
1:02:34
that’s where a lot of racism, discrimination, comes in.
1:02:41
I don’t know of any Asian students, especially Chinese students, who
1:02:46
don’t get in on first application, not speaking good English, blah, blah,
1:02:54
blah, but they do have the money.
1:03:00
Students of color are looked upon as being, you know, from backgrounds like
1:03:09
the one that I told you I wasn’t from.
1:03:13
That’s the discrimination and the racism that students of color face.
1:03:18
They’re looked at as their history, not the progress out of that history.
1:03:31
What am I saying?
1:03:32
I can tell you another example of that.
1:03:34
I have some friends, some people who I know, who are always, and I know they’re
1:03:41
trying to be nice, or complimentary.
1:03:44
For example, last night, I went to the ballet, and I wore a piece of
1:03:49
jewelry that I know is very precious.
1:03:52
I don’t wear it that much, because it’s a very good piece.
1:03:57
I have that stuff in my family.
1:04:02
They always wore nice jewelry and clothes.
1:04:06
Fortunately, these were not women that I knew, but individually these
1:04:13
women came up and go, oh, that jewelry is—now it is pretty, but I
1:04:22
take from that would you do that to
1:04:27
Carolyn Chambers?
1:04:28
Who used to be the wealthiest White woman in Eugene?
1:04:34
Are you doing it?
1:04:35
See, I have that Blackness in me.
1:04:37
It doesn’t go away, the mistreatment.
1:04:40
I’m thinking, well, yes it is a fabulous piece of jewelry, and you notice it,
1:04:47
but is there something else to this?
1:04:50
You didn’t expect me to ever have a piece of jewelry?
1:04:54
I mean, blah!
1:04:55
But you don’t do that.
1:04:57
I just said, oh, thank you, it’s a piece that my husband
1:05:00
gave me on a special—something.
1:05:03
But, they don’t know that I’m raging inside.
1:05:06
Don’t be telling me my jewelry is beautiful.
1:05:10
I know its beautiful [laughs] . My children, when I tell them
1:05:16
that story, they go, well, Mom, they’re just trying to be nice.
1:05:19
I said, yeah, I know, but I’ve got too much of the old Black woman in me and I’m
1:05:25
wondering if they’re thinking where did you get a piece of jewelry like that or
1:05:30
how did you have nerve to have a piece?
1:05:34
It’s not really rational, because I think they’re well-meaning,
1:05:38
but it’s like mm-hmm.
1:05:41
Those students of color still find that the university is negligent because
1:05:49
when there is something that they don’t have in that context, the university
1:05:57
context, they’re held to it, but they know that their White colleagues,
1:06:05
or whatever you call your student—
1:06:08
Colleagues, yeah.
1:06:11
Yeah.
1:06:12
They don’t have to go through that requirement.
1:06:15
Now, I can’t tell you what it is.
1:06:18
But I know that had I been a White woman, maybe, mmmm,
1:06:26
with the educational background that I had, I went to a private,
1:06:30
private Methodist school.
1:06:32
It was not a junior college.
1:06:35
It was a very, very upper-class—my dad probably still owes the tuition for me.
1:06:43
He probably died before he finished paying it.
1:06:46
[Cut in the recording]
1:06:47
... that I’m your friend.
1:06:49
We’ve always been friends.
1:06:50
We’ve raised our little boys here in this church.
1:06:52
I’ve loved you forever, but when you constantly compliment me on something
1:07:02
that is totally ordinary for me,
1:07:09
that means you don’t really know who I am, do you?
1:07:13
Well, what do you mean, Charmaine?
1:07:14
I said, all these years we’ve known each other, I don’t come from the street.
1:07:21
I come from a very wealthy Black family.
1:07:25
But I can’t celebrate it, because you people keep thinking
1:07:28
everything I have is accidental.
1:07:32
Yes, Ed and I spent our hard-earned money fixing this house, blah, blah, blah,
1:07:40
but had I not come form that kind of family I wouldn’t have had that kind
1:07:43
of background, to, blah, blah, blah,
1:07:49
to get a job at the university.
1:07:51
Ed would not have been educated had he not come from that White grandfather who
1:07:56
did see that his mother, his child by this Black woman, did get some education.
1:08:04
She lived on the, they lived on the place with them so they
1:08:07
picked up some of the privilege.
1:08:14
And Martha,
1:08:17
she was just looking at me like [mimics confused expression] . I
1:08:19
said, I don’t mean to sound rude, but really, I’m telling you, I’m
1:08:26
never surprised at anything that you have, because I know you deserve it.
1:08:34
You got it because you knew where it was, or you knew it because your great-great
1:08:38
grandmother came cover here on the Mayflower and left it for you [laughs]
1:08:45
. I don’t have that in my background, but that’s why I dress the way I dress.
1:08:53
I don’t dress this way to show off.
1:08:56
We’ve always dressed nice to go to church, that kind of thing.
1:09:02
This, in a sense, then leads us in various directions.
1:09:08
Since you started to talk about your personal relationships with people
1:09:15
that are friends or acquaintances, people that you associate with.
1:09:21
Right.
1:09:23
Tell us a little bit more about those relations, relations that
1:09:27
you have with your neighbors, with your fellow churchgoers.
1:09:33
Give us some more examples of the way those relations
1:09:42
pan out, and be as concrete as you can with examples.
1:09:47
Let’s think.
1:09:50
The neighbors who we have the best relationships with
1:09:57
in this neighborhood have been people who
1:10:04
had some commonalities with Ed and me in that they were educated,
1:10:13
they’d been teachers... in other words, they were not blue-collar.
1:10:20
They were a little higher up on the—and I know that I’m
1:10:27
using the word education a lot.
1:10:30
I do believe that that is really what is lacking with so many of
1:10:35
us, is really being educated in how people are, how the world works,
1:10:45
and I don’t mean presidential level,
1:10:49
but I mean the level of...let me just use this example: Obama never would
1:10:55
have become president had he not been—that man could run the world,
1:11:02
because of his brilliance and his knowing how to use it and his exposure.
1:11:11
Yes, his mother was white, but they were from a pretty well-educated family,
1:11:18
and I don’t mean college educated.
1:11:20
I just mean educated in their heads and hearts to know what’s
1:11:25
right and what is just totally not.
1:11:29
He was accepted by his grandparents.
1:11:32
He was loved.
1:11:34
He was given privileges that most little Black boys of his age, you
1:11:40
know, I see him roaming around Eugene, Obama’s age, and they don’t
1:11:46
look like they are headed anywhere.
1:11:49
He was totally the exception, and he never would have become president.
1:11:57
You see, there are White people who know the difference.
1:12:01
Let’s get on specifically to your neighbors and relations—
1:12:05
So, I’m saying the same thing.
1:12:09
Had Ed and I not been at the level that we are educationally, we would have moved out
1:12:20
of this neighborhood, because we’ve had neighbors who were less than educated in
1:12:28
terms of raising their children, educating them But for the most part, this street
1:12:36
in particular has contained people who
1:12:42
had a level—well, for example, one of our neighbors down the street
1:12:45
her husband, he was young, and he was already retired from the Navy.
1:12:52
He had a level of security and education that prevented him from
1:12:59
worrying about Ed and me being Black moving into this neighborhood.
1:13:03
Does that make sense to you?
1:13:06
That’s the kind of education I’m talking about.
1:13:09
Mary and I are still friends.
1:13:10
Mary doesn’t have much beyond high school, but she comes from a family
1:13:17
who always taught respect for other people, you know, education’s important,
1:13:24
you raise your children properly.
1:13:26
I’m considering all of that to be an educated person.
1:13:31
So, tell me more specifically are
1:13:37
you friends with any of the neighbors?
1:13:39
Do you have relationship?
1:13:42
I think it’s not—
1:13:45
In Eugene?
1:13:45
Yeah, here.
1:13:45
It’s not necessarily
1:13:49
the case, whatever race or ethnic background, that neighbors even
1:13:54
have anything to do with each other.
1:13:57
So—
1:13:58
It’s as matter with—
1:14:02
Have you ever become friends with the neighbors?
1:14:04
Have you experienced anything directly positive or directly negative?
1:14:11
With
1:14:14
[counts] one, two, three, four, five neighbors who have been here forever,
1:14:25
we have good, you know they, my children played with Paul.
1:14:30
But they are of that ilk.
1:14:32
They are of that,
1:14:35
you know, they had a stable family.
1:14:38
I don’t know which I’m emphasizing more: education with your family or just plain
1:14:44
getting to know things better and broader.
1:14:48
They have a broader outlook.
1:14:51
Our neighbors, Bill and Peggy, they were elderly when we moved
1:14:54
here, but Bill had worked meat marketing in New York or somewhere.
1:15:01
You know he had a broad sense of the world.
1:15:06
Peggy was a little,
1:15:09
little persnickety with us, but she was kind of that way with everybody: oh,
1:15:16
don’t let the boys step on my grass.
1:15:18
You know that kind of nonsense.
1:15:20
My children never stepped on her grass.
1:15:23
That kind of stuff.
1:15:24
I don’t know that it was so racially motivated, but it
1:15:27
was just the way Peggy was.
1:15:29
Bill was just the opposite.
1:15:33
Our neighbor, Muriel, who passed away, just not too long ago,
1:15:38
and her husband were friendly,
1:15:43
because Muriel worked some of the better clubs in Eugene.
1:15:47
She was a gourmet salad maker or something for Valley River or something.
1:15:53
She did not have that edge.
1:15:56
When you, I don’t see it so much these days.
1:16:01
I think a lot of these young people who have these jobs have a hip
1:16:05
rudeness about them, and their managers don’t tell them, oh no, not in here.
1:16:11
There are two places that I can go, and those people are trained.
1:16:16
They have no attitudes about any of that stupid stuff.
1:16:22
You see, I always know that if there’s an attitude up in this place it’s
1:16:27
going to rear its ugly head on me.
1:16:31
Okay, we had neighbors, we had one woman coming to look at this house
1:16:35
years ago and she came over here, knocked on the door, rang the bell,
1:16:43
or whatever, and I went to the door.
1:16:47
She said, um... you’re the neighbor?
1:16:52
I’m over... she just nearly fell apart.
1:16:57
She said, I was over looking at the house, and I was, I just wondered if
1:17:02
you have a tape measure we could use?
1:17:04
I said, sure.
1:17:05
Gave it to her.
1:17:07
She went on her way.
1:17:08
The realtor
1:17:11
came and told me she went up one side of him and down the other, why
1:17:17
didn’t you tell me we had, there were colored people living in that house?
1:17:22
[Cut in recording]
1:17:24
. So, continue with that thought.
1:17:25
Okay, well, over the years we’ve had... when we moved into this
1:17:30
neighborhood, there were like, probably 4 elderly couples.
1:17:34
We were never friendly with them, necessarily, either because they
1:17:40
didn’t feel comfortable with us.
1:17:43
I never knew, because we had no relationship.
1:17:48
But, for the most part, we’ve had, the neighbors that I have now who I
1:17:54
am friends with and I could contact if I needed anything, are here.
1:18:01
We have two or three who don’t, what do you call it?
1:18:08
Interact with anybody, and I think it’s because they’re renters, and I
1:18:14
think they have a renter’s mentality.
1:18:16
They just don’t want to get close.
1:18:18
I don’t know what it is.
1:18:19
I know, in particular, there’s one house down the street that isn’t a rental, but
1:18:25
he’s not friendly with anyone because his yard looks like the junkyard, and
1:18:29
I believe that’s a part of his—you see, it’s people’s own kinds of insecurities
1:18:38
and backwardness that will keep them on that track, because this person, this
1:18:47
young person I was told is a suspect in writing the graffiti, is a teenager,
1:18:55
and he’s been in trouble before.
1:18:58
So, troubled people.
1:19:06
What about when your children were growing up?
1:19:10
So, there were some neighbors with children of the same age.
1:19:13
Mm-hmm [nods]
1:19:14
. Did they all play together?
1:19:17
Well, I’ll tell you.
1:19:20
I have to say I chose, Ed and I selected out who our children associated with
1:19:30
because we’ve always known that our children were vulnerable to all of
1:19:38
these issues that I’m talking about.
1:19:40
My children were not of the ilk that some children were, but they didn’t know it.
1:19:48
They were privileged to the degree that we come from a very well-educated family.
1:19:54
We have these expectations.
1:19:56
Your dad is—so, what I have seen with my children is I’ve seen a
1:20:02
lot of under-educated children who wanted to be their friend.
1:20:14
I don’t know what that phenomena is, but maybe Greg knows it.
1:20:21
Somehow, their—
1:20:22
Under-educated...
1:20:23
White children.
1:20:25
White children that wanted to be their friend?
1:20:26
Yes.
1:20:29
Maybe because my children,
1:20:35
I would like to think that my children were nice children.
1:20:40
Maybe the other children would discriminate against those lower-income
1:20:45
children, and so they ran to my children.
1:20:49
I don’t know what that phenomena is, but I’ve seen it more than once.
1:20:54
I know that it is, it was kind of a phenomena that was happening.
1:20:59
Children who I didn’t really have faith in their parenting background, so I
1:21:06
didn’t want my children being around that.
1:21:08
I wanted them to be around children whose parents had supervision of
1:21:14
them and who they could have the same kinds of activities levels together
1:21:20
and the same kind of interest.
1:21:22
I knew that my children... I was the snob in that case.
1:21:29
I really did monitor carefully, not
1:21:35
ever telling them no you can’t play with that kid.
1:21:38
Somehow I would work it around where the schedule didn’t work or whatever.
1:21:44
Usually, it worked itself out, because usually these children were
1:21:47
free and available after school, which meant to me they didn’t
1:21:51
have supervision at home, somebody telling them they have to come home.
1:21:58
Now, did I answer the neighborhood thing?
1:22:01
This neighborhood, well, we decided, I’ll tell ya, we decided to buy
1:22:06
this house on the basis that it was in a school, Adam’s school was
1:22:12
a very stable school at that time.
1:22:15
They taught the basics.
1:22:17
The teachers were—now, there have been some issues with my children at school
1:22:22
with other little students that may have been racial or class, because
1:22:28
my children went to school dressed properly, not overdressed, but properly.
1:22:34
The neighbors up and down here have been tolerable.
1:22:37
Because,
1:22:39
for one thing, Ed and I had dispositions where you know we’re here.
1:22:48
We know that this is a good place for us.
1:22:51
This house is one that we chose on the basis of the school and the way
1:22:56
the house is set up and our budget.
1:22:59
Now, we also have a very keen sense of what is safe.
1:23:06
We would never buy a house in the River Road area at that time, even though
1:23:12
River Road has some upper pocket people,
1:23:19
but still it’s been a little risky in that area.
1:23:23
Even North Eugene still has some of that racial tension stuff because my son
1:23:31
counseled at north, and he said, Mom, you know—I don’t, he said, it’s amazing that
1:23:40
I run into these kids who have that racial edge thing to them, Black and White.
1:23:48
So, what about when you were—when did you buy this house?
1:23:52
In 19...let’s see, okay.
1:23:55
I have to count the children’s age
1:24:05
[counts to self]
1:24:08
. 1972.
1:24:08
Okay.
1:24:09
Mm-hmm.
1:24:11
How was your saga of looking for a house?
1:24:15
That, Ed and I really pre-programmed by going to
1:24:27
professors, his professors who he knew knew what we were talking
1:24:32
about, and one of them was Charlie.
1:24:36
Charlie was from back east.
1:24:38
He was really hip.
1:24:39
He was in the drama department, just, because Ed is a musician a lot
1:24:45
of around hip people, I mean aware.
1:24:47
Musicians tend to be, they don’t have time for that foolishness, you know.
1:24:54
So, we went to Charlie and said, Charlie we know that you know
1:24:58
Eugene very well, and we really feel comfortable—you know who you’re
1:25:02
comfortable with, and we trust you.
1:25:06
What can you tell us about looking for a house?
1:25:09
Charlie was right on it.
1:25:12
He said, okay, here are the realtors.
1:25:16
There weren’t that many in town like there are now.
1:25:20
He said, I know this guy is Canadian.
1:25:23
He won’t have any problem finding you a house in a neighborhood that is friendly.
1:25:29
He’s not going to just put you anywhere or he’s not even going to take you to those
1:25:35
places, because he knows the racial issue, not because Canadians, well, because
1:25:41
they don’t mess with a lot of that.
1:25:44
They didn’t in those days.
1:25:45
They were just Canadian and they were pretty friendly, whatever.
1:25:51
We got with a really fine person who really knew the scope.
1:26:00
Ed and I coming from Oakland and San Francisco have big antennas, and
1:26:06
so we always knew where we, oh no.
1:26:12
That’s how we screened out north of whatever and south of whatever.
1:26:19
We knew the hilly-hilly area was filled with whatever, and we didn’t
1:26:24
want to live on a hill anyway because I have a bad leg and blah, blah, blah.
1:26:29
The neighborhood had the schools that we thought would be good for our children.
1:26:36
They had a mixture of children.
1:26:38
Like, this school down here used to be the best school for that nice mixture.
1:26:46
Of course, everybody was so surprised that we didn’t send our
1:26:48
children to the Catholic school.
1:26:51
I know that Greg’s children went to the Catholic school, but it was way later.
1:26:56
When our children were little,
1:27:00
there was still some weirdness going on in the Catholic church when we got here.
1:27:07
That’s another institution that we’ve had to just blow through,
1:27:12
you know like we’re Catholic.
1:27:15
You deal with it.
1:27:17
That’s your problem.
1:27:18
We stayed on top of it, and that’s why we go to the Newman Center, the student
1:27:24
center, because we tried St. Mary’s and it was way like those churches
1:27:29
were in those other neighborhoods where we would have to go to church.
1:27:34
It was horrible.
1:27:34
The priests were, ew.
1:27:39
It was terrible.
1:27:40
Narrow, you know.
1:27:43
We still deal with some of that in our heads with the Catholic church.
1:27:47
That’s due to that there’s something that we pass around in this country.
1:27:55
Give us some of those concrete, really concrete examples, with the Catholic
1:28:00
church when you were at St. Mary’s.
1:28:05
You know, I can’t say that—see, we didn’t stay long enough to even interact with
1:28:09
the priest or anything, but just the way the priest, the tone, you know, the
1:28:15
sermon that they chose, just the order of everything was just way, way below,
1:28:24
or out of order for what people our age needed, and especially a Black couple.
1:28:32
It was just way old-fashioned.
1:28:36
Can you give us some examples?
1:28:38
Yeah, just plain narrow and boring and out—
1:28:46
What would they be talking about?
1:28:48
I
1:28:51
don’t even—they’d be giving the sermon, but you knew that
1:28:57
they were just scaring people.
1:29:01
It was kind of a scary... it wasn’t a pulling you in, teaching
1:29:08
you what Christianity is.
1:29:11
No, it was like—see, now, I was young.
1:29:16
For me it was like, oh, that’s scary.
1:29:22
We’d go home—that was when I was really young, but St. Mary’s had that same,
1:29:27
rigid, old-fashioned, Catholic nonsense.
1:29:32
They weren’t friendly with any of us, they weren’t friendly with the congregation.
1:29:39
These priests at Newman Center stand outside, I mean, blah, blah, blah.
1:29:45
One of the churches that, see Ed and I had a jazz trio, and we played
1:29:50
for very many fine, wealthy people who were giving house parties.
1:29:56
One of the Catholic churches, oh, Newman Center, decided that they wanted
1:30:01
us to be the music ministers for that year and play jazz: take the Christian
1:30:11
songs and put a jazz bass to it.
1:30:15
It wasn’t like we were in there singing about baby, baby,
1:30:17
baby, momma, momma, momma.
1:30:19
We weren’t doing that, but we were taking the Christian music
1:30:22
and singing and playing it.
1:30:25
The students loved it.
1:30:27
I mean, they just loved it, because it was up to date.
1:30:30
Well, another church invited us, I guess unbeknownst to the head priest.
1:30:36
I don’t know what, or they out-talked him.
1:30:40
St. Paul, I think it was St. Paul or St. Alice out there in that part of town.
1:30:45
We played our music, and then after church we were putting our stuff away
1:30:49
and the old priest—and I can say this, the old priest, came out and said,
1:30:54
well, I don’t know where you folks come from, but we don’t do that kind
1:30:59
of music up in the Catholic church.
1:31:02
Ed just let him talk, and so finally Ed said to him, well, you better go talk
1:31:07
to your people because they hired us.
1:31:09
We didn’t come up in here with our instruments.
1:31:13
Ed said, furthermore, Father, I don’t know what to think about
1:31:18
you, but my sister’s a nun.
1:31:21
My family’s Catholic.
1:31:24
Charmaine’s grandpa was raised by Catholic nuns.
1:31:28
So, it’s not like you could kick us out because we weren’t
1:31:32
Catholic and we were playing jazz.
1:31:33
He said,
1:31:36
talk to somebody else.
1:31:38
Don’t ever bug the musicians.
1:31:41
Ed gave him a little of manners: hey, you don’t mess with musicians, because
1:31:48
we are hired by somebody who wanted us.
1:31:52
We didn’t come up in here with our instruments and start playing
1:31:58
[laughs]
1:32:00
. There is something, actually, that came up in your other interview and
1:32:06
also I think we’ve been talking about with other people and that Greg has
1:32:11
been telling me teeny bits about—you’re Catholic, and many of the African
1:32:19
Americans here are Protestant, and there’s some kind of conflict that goes on.
1:32:29
Could you tell a little bit more about that?
1:32:32
Well, you know, should I say this off the record, Greg?
1:32:37
Let it roll.
1:32:39
You’ll.
1:32:40
It’s good to go.
1:32:42
I have
1:32:47
not had any Black women friends.
1:32:51
I have—there are Black women in this town who are nice.
1:32:56
They’ve been nice to me, but to be like friend, girlfriends or anything,
1:33:02
and it has to do with several things.
1:33:05
It has to do with mine and Ed’s level when we came here.
1:33:11
They put us into this stuck-up group: they’re university people,
1:33:17
therefore, which wasn’t true.
1:33:21
My family beat it into our heads that we are Black people.
1:33:28
We’re all in this together.
1:33:30
My grandpa would always say, I’m Black.
1:33:35
I might have had that White sailor made my mother pregnant, but I’m Black.
1:33:41
She was my mother.
1:33:43
She dragged me around, you know?
1:33:46
So, I’m Black.
1:33:49
So, we were never allowed to do that.
1:33:52
Never.
1:33:53
Never.
1:33:54
But they don’t know that.
1:33:56
That’s an issue with Black people.
1:33:58
We do that to each other.
1:34:01
We will put us in categories and then
1:34:07
we can’t make a relationship.
1:34:09
Now, what Ed and I have done, though, is whenever there was someone in
1:34:13
town who had something to offer someone who came to speak at the
1:34:17
university, that had something to offer that was of Black history,
1:34:23
Black something, we would invite them.
1:34:27
With the university, we would say, we would like to host these people
1:34:32
to our house for the Black community.
1:34:36
We’ve always had this house, this house has always been open.
1:34:39
They would come.
1:34:40
Some would, some wouldn’t.
1:34:42
Some would come and get into an argument because Charmaine and Ed had liquor in
1:34:47
their house, and you know we don’t drink.
1:34:51
It’s like—that kind of silly stuff.
1:34:56
Anything they could find.
1:34:57
You know Charmaine, she’s too proper.
1:35:00
She speaks proper.
1:35:02
Meaning, I speak my grammar correctly.
1:35:05
Now,
1:35:07
it’s never been told to me, but I know it.
1:35:13
Now in this age, it’s like when I see them, I’m just friendly to them.
1:35:21
Some of them have changed, but there’s still a little bit of, well, Charmaine...
1:35:29
whatever.
1:35:30
So, I really must tell you, I have never had a close Black friend
1:35:35
in this town, except two women who had a lot in common with me.
1:35:41
They were both teachers.
1:35:43
We’ve always been friends.
1:35:44
One of them had a son who Edwin, my son, played with.
1:35:48
They’re good, good friends.
1:35:50
But, even we, the two of us, we don’t even talk about our differences, because
1:35:57
she has a totally different attitude about how to practice her Blackness, and
1:36:04
on, I don’t let White people bother me.
1:36:07
I’ll say, oh, yeah, I don’t let them bother me, but, honey, if she
1:36:11
bothers me I’ll call it like it is.
1:36:16
I don’t pretend that, no, I’m not, no.
1:36:20
I see it.
1:36:21
I’ll call it.
1:36:22
We have that difference of opinion.
1:36:24
It’s like, oh please.
1:36:25
Stop that.
1:36:27
I accept people, but that woman is prejudiced, or she’s just not with it.
1:36:34
I don’t spend that much time.
1:36:36
Well, she just means well.
1:36:37
No.
1:36:38
No.
1:36:39
No.
1:36:39
No.
1:36:41
So, we differ on that.
1:36:43
We’re not close, close, close, close, close.
1:36:46
Like, she would let her son play with a wide range of children.
1:36:52
I didn’t.
1:36:53
I’d say to her, I don’t let Edwin play with those kids because they’ve
1:36:58
got some kind of an attitude that is not going to be good for him.
1:37:04
My children can’t grow up thinking they’re privileged beyond privilege,
1:37:08
or whatever that silly stuff is.
1:37:11
We have to protect our children from that.
1:37:14
Do you have any close friends here?
1:37:20
No.
1:37:22
I have one friend who came into mine and Ed’s life several years ago, and
1:37:31
I would say that she and I are the closest two Black women that we know,
1:37:40
because she has some of the same issues.
1:37:44
She tried attending the Black church out there, but she’s lighter-skin.
1:37:52
Her hair is straight.
1:37:53
She speaks good English.
1:37:56
She went to several Catholic colleges, and she’s a lesbian.
1:38:02
Oh, my Lord.
1:38:07
We are good friends.
1:38:08
Actually, we would be sisters, because our upbringing was very similar.
1:38:17
The things that people have criticized about us would be the same.
1:38:23
She says, I’ve never had a lot of Black women friends because right away they
1:38:27
just go right to my skin color, my hair.
1:38:30
Do you have any close White friends?
1:38:35
I have what you would call real friends.
1:38:40
I have a woman, Hope Pressman, and I’ll say her name because
1:38:44
she is a fabulous woman.
1:38:47
She and Ed and I became friends because they were marching to get their degree.
1:38:55
She was getting her MA, and Ed was getting his Ph.D. She had
1:38:59
known about Ed being on campus.
1:39:02
We’re friends because she is a totally, totally well-developed,
1:39:09
completely developed woman.
1:39:12
She is 97.
1:39:15
Collin saw her the other night at the museum, but she is what I would
1:39:23
call a fully developed human being.
1:39:27
You know what I mean?
1:39:30
She took us in, and, yes.
1:39:35
Anything I would ask for, I could get help from Hope.
1:39:41
We’ve been to their house.
1:39:43
They’ve been here.
1:39:44
I mean, just an open, open, open, intelligent woman.
1:39:48
Now, her husband was a little bit on the stand-offish side of stuff, not just
1:39:55
with us, but he was an insurance type.
1:39:59
So, you see, as long as I can understand where you’re coming from, I can tolerate
1:40:05
whatever this is you’re putting out.
1:40:07
He just wasn’t that friendly.
1:40:09
I mean, he wasn’t unfriendly to us, but he just wasn’t she,
1:40:13
not as open and welcoming.
1:40:15
But, you know what?
1:40:17
That’s what is getting me through.
1:40:20
Okay, I can tell you, that’s what has gotten me through living on this street
1:40:25
with friendly or unfriendly neighbors, attending that university, whatever.
1:40:30
I have to give myself credit for this: I have such a perception and
1:40:40
a depth of knowledge about people.
1:40:45
You know, I mean,
1:40:49
and based on that, that’s where I take them from.
1:40:53
I’m going to change the subject now a little bit.
1:40:57
But, you were here in the ‘70s at the time when the Civil Rights Movement when there
1:41:04
was a fairly good, active Civil Rights Movement here in Eugene and on the campus.
1:41:12
Can you tell us about what you experienced at that time here?
1:41:17
Give as much details as you can.
1:41:20
I can.
1:41:21
Okay.
1:41:21
And what you did.
1:41:26
What were your contributions?
1:41:26
Ed and I, Ed, my husband, was a very politically active
1:41:32
person in San Francisco.
1:41:34
COREs and all that stuff, because San Francisco, of all of those cities, had
1:41:42
some of the worst race problems, and
1:41:47
kind of hidden in all that tourist fun stuff.
1:41:52
Terrible.
1:41:53
Some of the worst property owners for Black people to try to deal with were the
1:42:01
Chinese, and it’s kind of interesting.
1:42:05
I can kind of see why, but it was—so, we move here with that kind of background.
1:42:11
I didn’t do a lot of picketing, but I’ll tell you my mother’s and dad’s
1:42:14
house in Berkeley was politic central, because my mother was so smart when it
1:42:24
came to politics and she was a spitfire.
1:42:28
I mean, she knew stuff.
1:42:30
That’s why I’m saying we got through those schools so well, because she knew
1:42:35
how to go up there and talk to those people with the political edge and stuff.
1:42:40
Well, when we came to Eugene we had that with us, that attitude.
1:42:44
So, Ed joined NAACP.
1:42:48
We joined on whatever needed to be joined onto.
1:42:51
What were the different places that you could join?
1:42:55
There’s always been a democratic headquarters somewhere.
1:42:59
It has moved to different places because of the property thing.
1:43:04
I don’t know what that is.
1:43:06
So, we’ve always been Democrats.
1:43:10
We’ve always gone to meetings, Democratic Party meetings.
1:43:13
Basically, that’s what we did in those days, which was Democratic Party stuff.
1:43:20
There was
1:43:22
no Calk, but we also joined it eventually.
1:43:27
What else have we joined?
1:43:31
Ed was at every political rally that there was.
1:43:35
Robert Kennedy came through on a train.
1:43:38
I mean, every—
1:43:39
Tell us about this, because we need the story of the history
1:43:45
of this, what was going on.
1:43:50
We don’t know anything.
1:43:51
Tell us as though we don’t know anything about it.
1:43:51
Okay, well, just as much involved as Ed was, there were White people
1:44:00
in this community who were the same.
1:44:04
There’s still a few whose names, Jerry Rust, ran for what?
1:44:11
Commissioner or something.
1:44:12
There’s still some of those people in this town, so there
1:44:16
was always a bunch of people.
1:44:21
Now, I can’t name names, because you know I had two kids.
1:44:25
I wasn’t on committees like Ed was, but there was always, always a large segment
1:44:35
of people who were politically active.
1:44:39
They knew what needed to happen, but then, what happened?
1:44:46
Something, Eugene just kind of became sort of, what do you say?
1:44:54
Incorporated with
1:44:58
what cities do.
1:45:01
They become larger, therefore the roots.
1:45:07
You know like the Democratic Party is not the one that, they’re not as active.
1:45:12
Maybe people were tired and stopped doing that.
1:45:16
But something happened.
1:45:18
It’s not anything like it was.
1:45:21
In those days, people were out marching on the campus.
1:45:26
They were marching against Nixon.
1:45:28
They were marching for so-and-so, very, very active people, and Ed
1:45:35
and I were included in the group.
1:45:38
There was no problem of race or anything.
1:45:42
We were always welcomed into that group.
1:45:48
What else can I, what other information?
1:45:52
That was just a wonderful, busy political activism going on in those days.
1:46:00
I don’t, I mean, there still are groups because I go to lunch with a
1:46:05
friend from church, and she went to the Trump rally just so she could see it.
1:46:13
There are still people, but as far as Black people are concerned,
1:46:19
we’ve only mostly, Black people in Eugene, except for a few of us,
1:46:25
have mostly, what would you say?
1:46:30
Been active with their church.
1:46:34
I think the Eugene pioneers, people who came here during those days,
1:46:43
I find that they were overwhelmed.
1:46:50
It has had an effect on them in their participation.
1:46:55
I still, and in their resources, because they didn’t come here with anything.
1:47:05
I would like to use the word overwhelmed, because, to me,
1:47:09
they still are under-represented.
1:47:13
They don’t show up at the Democratic Party meetings.
1:47:18
They don’t show up.
1:47:20
I know there aren’t that many, but we still need to get together
1:47:28
and have a group, like this group.
1:47:33
We need to respect.
1:47:34
I mean, they have a lot to offer to other Blacks.
1:47:40
Well, just because there aren’t very many of us here makes the difference.
1:47:44
It’s
1:47:46
easy to think, well, that doesn’t bother me because I have a
1:47:50
job now, and blah, blah, blah.
1:47:52
But I think they’re still a bit intimidated by the racial
1:47:56
issues and haven’t had time to really feel successful with it.
1:48:05
This isn’t going out to the public, is it?
1:48:09
This information?
1:48:11
Well, I just want to say, a lot of the Black people who were
1:48:17
here as pioneers had it rough.
1:48:22
They’re still kind of in that
1:48:27
condition, or position.
1:48:29
There aren’t too, too, too many of them still.
1:48:32
But they didn’t get a chance to grow beyond what they were trapped in.
1:48:40
So, I think some of them are still suffering from a kind
1:48:44
of a, what would you say?
1:48:45
a poverty mentality, even though some of them have gone on to college
1:48:52
and gotten jobs at the university.
1:48:56
I still think that, as a whole, Black people basically, I believe
1:49:03
we are, we are feeling the neglect.
1:49:12
I don’t know that we can ever overcome all that’s been destroyed about us.
1:49:18
That’s what I’m trying to say about Eugene.
1:49:20
I believe that the Black people in Eugene did not have resources.
1:49:25
They weren’t comfortable going to
1:49:29
Democratic Party meetings, because they were surrounded by people who
1:49:33
spoke better than they, or had more than they, and that’s intimidating.
1:49:41
I do believe that the difference between mine and Ed’s coming here was that
1:49:48
we never suffered, our families never suffered, that kind of neglect to
1:49:55
the point where it got to our souls.
1:49:58
It didn’t get to our souls.
1:50:02
Ed and I knew it was there.
1:50:04
We faced it.
1:50:05
Every day I walk out of this house, I know I’m a Black woman.
1:50:08
I don’t know what fool I’m going to run into in Eugene, but the
1:50:13
difference is I have the heart and the head that I know how to handle it.
1:50:22
I’m secure with it.
1:50:26
We don’t talk about that a lot, and I don’t know whether these Black
1:50:29
pioneers up there talk about it a lot, but I do believe in my heart
1:50:35
and soul that Black people are in a very depressed state still.
1:50:45
Did you participate, do you now and have you participated in the NAACP?
1:50:52
I do, and I always have, because of my respect for what the NAACP is formulated
1:51:03
under, the umbrella: helping Black people.
1:51:09
I say that because there’s been some confusion.
1:51:12
Just lately, I’ve talked to a couple of younger people and I
1:51:16
say, you know—well they say, well, White people were always in it.
1:51:19
Yes, they were always in it, but they were not the controllers of the
1:51:26
mindset that it was set up under.
1:51:30
It was strictly for Black people, to help them get a start and get ahead.
1:51:38
These were White people who had resources and wanted to do that.
1:51:43
We were talking about it because somebody had made a comment, I get, this was a
1:51:48
Black person said, I get sick of being in a group and the next thing I look up
1:51:53
and the white people are taking it over.
1:51:55
Somebody made that comment somewhere.
1:51:58
I’ve heard it a lot of times.
1:52:01
So, that’s what I’m talking about when I say we don’t
1:52:08
understand that we have power against that.
1:52:11
We can open our mouths and say to those people, even if they’re giving
1:52:14
lots of money to NAACP, calm down.
1:52:18
This is about us.
1:52:21
This is about us getting ahead.
1:52:24
It’s not about being lesbian.
1:52:26
It’s not about being any of that.
1:52:29
Yes, those groups have the same kind of background of oppression and everything.
1:52:35
This was formulated to help Black people and we still need that help, badly.
1:52:42
We cannot have it taken over by a privileged group thinking,
1:52:49
because the thinking is different.
1:52:53
Have you done any direct, participated in any direct way in the NAACP?
1:52:58
Yes.
1:52:59
I have.
1:53:00
What have you done?
1:53:01
Tell us about it.
1:53:02
I have donated every time I can, financially, because we’ve not always
1:53:12
been known to be organized, and I don’t operate with any group or
1:53:17
committee that isn’t organized, because I don’t have that kind of patience.
1:53:21
NAACP,
1:53:23
over the years has really not had the kind of maturity
1:53:29
that NAACPs in the city, Berkeley, that I experienced.
1:53:34
I don’t
1:53:37
fault them for that, but I have a hard time keeping my focus with them, because
1:53:44
they’ll get off, and I’m thinking, ugh.
1:53:47
We don’t have time for this.
1:53:48
We need to stick with
1:53:53
getting things better for us and thinking better.
1:53:57
I can’t even go into all the details but it’s frustrating for us, for me, and for
1:54:04
Ed, because we know the NAACP from our childhood and what it was set out to be.
1:54:16
We’ve never had the kind of leadership, well, we’ve had a couple of people,
1:54:20
young people, who have come from cities who ran it, who organized it.
1:54:25
But, I think it’s another kind of regional thing.
1:54:29
I don’t think the national NAACP or those that are formulated and have
1:54:37
an organizational plan, I don’t think we get the kind of attention that we
1:54:44
deserve, because I found this out, this is one problem I’ve had with Eugene,
1:54:50
I found it out because I am a shopper.
1:54:53
I love to shop.
1:54:56
I don’t buy everything I see, but I love looking at stuff.
1:55:00
It’s the kind of frustrated artist in me, you know?
1:55:04
I just love—so, when we were first here, I would take my son, who has very flat
1:55:13
feet—I had polio when I was a kid, so
1:55:19
I know feet.
1:55:20
My family, they were adamant about taking care of your feet.
1:55:25
It was kind of like, I mean, they were on a, I mean they, you don’t neglect
1:55:34
your feet because it’s what you walk on.
1:55:38
So,
1:55:40
I’m trying to buy nice shoes for Edwin, leather shoes.
1:55:46
Couldn’t find a shoe store.
1:55:48
Finally, Sister Margaret Graziano,
1:55:53
who was 99, or 199 when she died, was a nun.
1:55:59
One day I was walking downtown with Edwin, and she said, well hi, Dear.
1:56:04
She always called me dear.
1:56:07
Well, what are you two doing today?
1:56:10
I said, well, Sister, Sister Margaret, I’m looking for a shoe store.
1:56:17
I went to Penny’s but I don’t like the quality of their shoes.
1:56:21
She said, oh, Dear.
1:56:25
Oh, Dear, yes.
1:56:26
I know
1:56:28
what you mean.
1:56:29
Well, there is a shoe store.
1:56:32
She told me, oh it’s where what that—it's on, is that Polk, not Polk...
1:56:40
oh gosh, West Brothers used to have a barbeque place, and now that is closed and
1:56:48
now it has a casino, poker night place?
1:56:54
What street is that?
1:56:56
I was on it the other day.
1:56:58
It’s been one way.
1:57:00
Oh!
1:57:02
It’s on that, it’s where all those people hang out.
1:57:06
That street.
1:57:06
Do you mean on West 7th?
1:57:06
I mean 6th?
1:57:09
It’s not 7th, it’s going this way [makes hand motion] . It’s the name of a street.
1:57:13
Is it Polk?
1:57:15
No, it’s—uh.
1:57:17
Olive.
1:57:21
Okay.
1:57:22
Olive.
1:57:23
Okay, there was a shoe store there, but I didn’t know Eugene.
1:57:30
So, I’m sticking with what I know.
1:57:32
Penny’s used to be in that corner.
1:57:34
I went in there.
1:57:36
That was a Jewish couple, and I knew it because our neighborhood had Jewish
1:57:44
shop owners who lived at their shop.
1:57:48
I kind of knew what Jewishness was like.
1:57:51
They were so friendly and so good.
1:57:56
So, I said, well, why is there only one shoe store where I
1:58:02
can find good shoes for my son?
1:58:06
She looked at me and said,
1:58:09
Eugene is considered a level, I think she said, in the market, you know of business,
1:58:18
well, okay, I’ll get to the point.
1:58:21
Eugene is a level D town.
1:58:25
We’re never going to—like the Nordstrom that they brought here is a junk shop.
1:58:30
So, they still treat us that way.
1:58:33
NAACP, I believe, does not get the service from the well-organized branches.
1:58:41
So, I don’t think our president gets the advice or the kinds of
1:58:47
opportunities to develop himself.
1:58:53
I don’t really have a lot of patience, but I will participate.
1:58:57
I did go and speak at their women’s speaker format, but I believe
1:59:03
that’s because there’s some young Black women who are interns.
1:59:08
They work in there with Eric and
1:59:12
they’re moving.
1:59:14
It was for women of women and I spoke.
1:59:18
They gave me the open mic, and it was lovely.
1:59:21
I spoke about being Black, being Black as a person, being Black in Eugene.
1:59:25
I will forever, ever, honor NAACP.
1:59:29
In
1:59:33
my maturity, I wish I had time, and I need to take time.
1:59:39
I really want to interface with NAACP on a level where before I leave this place
1:59:46
it will have much more than it has now.
1:59:49
I don’t mean a building and a library and all that, but just be at the top
1:59:56
of its job, because I think we can pull in White people to help, but I
2:00:04
think some of the White people that I’ve seen who really want to give up
2:00:09
their time, some of them are misguided.
2:00:11
They don’t really, they give the wrong information of their experience.
2:00:18
They’ll come in and, the White experience and the Black
2:00:22
experience is totally different.
2:00:25
I don’t care what you’re doing.
2:00:27
Even Bill Cosby with all his money.
2:00:31
You see they nabbed him, don’t you?
2:00:34
Yet Trump is running around here.
2:00:38
That is a color thing.
2:00:40
It has to be.
2:00:43
I can’t fathom anything else.
2:00:45
No, it was horrible, if Bill Cosby did all that, but he has more money
2:00:53
and more popularity than Trump.
2:00:56
He didn’t get away with it.
2:00:57
You see that?
2:00:58
Because most of the women were White.
2:01:01
Because White male American is what runs this place, and they take
2:01:09
sides and they run it the way they see it and it’s to their advantage.
2:01:16
I’m never going to shut up.
2:01:17
A lady tried to say to me once, and she happened to be Jewish: well, now, you
2:01:23
can’t blame all White—I said, hey, don’t you ever tell me that I can’t believe that
2:01:30
what is a major part of the philosophy of this country is that White men run it.
2:01:42
Well, thank you very much.
2:01:44
[Laughs] On that note.
2:01:47
I think we can go on and on and it’s probably getting late and
2:01:51
you’re probably getting tired.
2:01:52
No, I’m fine.
2:01:53
I’m fine, but I just want to say this to you and Greg.
2:01:57
Have I fulfilled this position properly?
2:02:04
I mean, I don’t want to leave out anything,
2:02:10
but I don’t, you know.
2:02:13
I don’t talk about it a lot, so it’s hard to organize it in your head.
2:02:18
The answer is yes, because I think
2:02:26
we’re, you know when I told you we’re getting life histories.
2:02:31
We’re following, you can see certain themes.
2:02:35
I’ve got some other themes in here that, you know, we could get into.
2:02:40
Right.
2:02:43
I think one of the things that I’m particularly, would like to see, I think
2:02:49
we’ve all talked about, is in an interview rather than just always focusing...
2:02:58
On the negative?
2:02:59
[Laughs]
2:03:00
. No.
2:03:00
I mean, focusing on this subject or that, but there’s much that comes about
2:03:06
from a person when you’re just telling, just your life, your, this aspect.
2:03:14
A lot of times you find out a lot more new and different things or
2:03:20
unexpected things that you don’t find out when you’re pointing.
2:03:25
Well—
2:03:26
So, from your, all of what you’ve been telling us, at least
2:03:31
certainly from my perspective, we
2:03:36
have to get Greg in here.
2:03:40
It seems to me that,
2:03:43
I guess one of the questions that come to mind as, you know, how is it
2:03:50
that an African American gets to be where you are now, whether it is that
2:03:56
you’re where you are now or whether we expected to be interviewing people
2:04:02
of all status got to be in other situations that are not as desirable.
2:04:08
Okay.
2:04:09
So, that’s a wonderful—
2:04:11
So, you really gave us, to me, you know a good, a point of view there,
2:04:20
that I think is going to contribute.
2:04:22
Right, because—
2:04:23
To this kind of historical knowledge that we’re looking for.
2:04:25
Yeah, I’m hoping what my interview will say to people is that I’m speaking
2:04:32
from my Black woman experience, and we are not, we’re nothing all alike.
2:04:41
That’s the thing that I have really been thinking about in all of this
2:04:48
is—people, because a lot of our problem, it’s not our problem.
2:04:56
It’s a people’s problem, is that they take us all and lump us into
2:05:00
one kind of misunderstood category.
2:05:06
My fighting that university was from my point of view.
2:05:11
Another woman from another background probably would have given up.
2:05:18
I have known too many black students, too many Black people who came to
2:05:23
this town with good intentions who gave it up, probably because their
2:05:30
background did not have that strength.
2:05:35
See, our family was constantly fighting, because there were dark-skinned ones.
2:05:41
I mean, my great aunt, who was my grandmother’s sister,
2:05:45
the Choctaw, was Black.
2:05:48
But, she had that, they had that background of, well, they had the culture.
2:05:54
They were Indian, although they were mistreated, but they still
2:05:57
had had, you know they had a tribe.
2:05:59
They had something.
2:06:01
So many Black people who came here with nothing and still have nothing are
2:06:05
still totally left out of that loop.
2:06:10
At the same time, a lot of white people want to lump us into that,
2:06:16
oh, poor thing you came from slavery.
2:06:18
How did you and Ed do this?
2:06:20
Well, we did have a little advantage, and it’s not a braggadocios point,
2:06:25
but it’s to point out that I still have that fight in me, you know.
2:06:32
Fortunately, I had that little bit of advantage.
2:06:35
I’m going to—we’re coming to the end, but I did want to ask you another little
2:06:39
more specific question about the NAACP.
2:06:42
Have you ever participated in their education committee,
2:06:47
given I’m thinking is a role...
2:06:51
Well, I think, no, because really to tell you the truth,
2:07:00
the NAACP has just not had enough resource of background of what they’re
2:07:13
really about and they’ve not had the personnel who had that background.
2:07:21
NAACP is not just a thing where we have a library and we have—see, we
2:07:31
don’t have the structure down yet.
2:07:35
Does that make sense?
2:07:36
We don’t—and I don’t want to hammer or harp on the leadership,
2:07:47
but there’s something else we don’t get.
2:07:51
We don’t get people on board who know enough about what this group
2:07:58
really started out doing and what it still can continue to do.
2:08:03
We’re just, it’s kind of like, we’re just what?
2:08:06
An organization,
2:08:10
and some of the people who have been in the leadership don’t even know what an
2:08:15
organization is supposed to look like.
2:08:18
I mean, I would never volunteer or elect myself or what to be elected as
2:08:26
president of NAACP, because it’s not just, you don’t compare it to, what?
2:08:36
Going to church.
2:08:40
Somebody in that church, they have a structure.
2:08:45
Priests, we have catechism, we have—well, NAACP, they
2:08:51
don’t have those, in writing, where you hold onto those and
2:08:58
that’s what you pass down.
2:09:03
That’s the difference between what I’m talking about, I’m using
2:09:07
the Catholic church, because it is the one church that has
2:09:13
structure.
2:09:15
You are not a part of it unless you go through this, and you go through this, and
2:09:20
you go through this, you go through this.
2:09:22
You’re on all those committees.
2:09:25
Now, NAACP can’t break itself down like that.
2:09:28
But a group like NAACP and other churches need a structure, because we need to,
2:09:36
people need to know, okay have I fulfilled this part of this so I’m part of this?
2:09:42
You know, you go to NAACP meeting, and it’s like what is?
2:09:47
Where do I fit?
2:09:49
Whatever.
2:09:54
What is your opinion, what is your concept of NAACP?
2:10:02
We know it’s—
2:10:05
My concept for this NAACP is that we contact—
2:10:11
Should be, in other words.
2:10:13
We contact national, and I know they do have some, you know—we
2:10:22
get it down from the go-get.
2:10:24
When did this start?
2:10:26
Who started it?
2:10:27
What is the mission?
2:10:31
Where do we slot our branch into this?
2:10:35
We can’t do all of this, for one thing we don’t have that many people
2:10:39
here in town and blah, blah, blah.
2:10:42
But that’s what I think.
2:10:43
That’s what feels like it’s missing to me, is a lot of, well, let me put it in
2:10:48
this—and Greg will understand what I’m talking about, and you probably, too.
2:10:53
There are a lot of churches that Black people can belong to, but very
2:11:01
few of them have the foundation of a religion that stays on track, on base,
2:11:12
and doesn’t get off into—megachurches
2:11:18
don’t have that.
2:11:21
So, it’s not just the little Black churches.
2:11:24
For years, people like my family have talked in the house, not out, about
2:11:32
oh, Reverend so and so, he doesn’t know anything about how to run a
2:11:38
church, because people would think that we were putting the Catholic
2:11:44
church against theirs, but I’m telling you that’s what the Catholic
2:11:47
church has that keeps me bound to it.
2:11:52
It has a structure.
2:11:56
I’ve been to communion.
2:11:58
I made a vow of this.
2:12:00
My children were confirmed in the faith.
2:12:03
You don’t have to do that to be a part of the church.
2:12:06
You can go to church.
2:12:06
You can go to the schools.
2:12:08
But if you’re going to be a truly practicing Christian of Catholic
2:12:13
faith, I value those things.
2:12:17
We have, you know, the commandments, the Lord’s Prayer.
2:12:21
Those were put in that practice.
2:12:25
You’ve been active in Catholic church, mainly at the Newman Center, or other?
2:12:32
In town, yes, because you see even though the Catholic church has that structure,
2:12:40
it’s the personality of the place that I’m talking about.
2:12:44
I don’t care for the personality of these churches in Eugene.
2:12:47
I just find them to be in a different era.
2:12:52
Tell us what your participation has been like at the Newman Center.
2:12:59
Well, my participation—I have participated on everything at that church.
2:13:06
We’ve been music ministers.
2:13:08
I’ve been in on helping students, I mean we still do it.
2:13:12
I take food during finals for the students, because basically that’s
2:13:16
the community that they serve.
2:13:18
But I also, my children were first communion there, baptized there,
2:13:24
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2:13:26
I still participate with other parents and their children.
2:13:31
Every bit of that church I participate in.
2:13:37
I’m not on the committee.
2:13:39
I’m not the committee chair, but I do know when they mention it in
2:13:43
the bulletin, I know what it is.
2:13:46
Give us a couple of concrete examples.
2:13:50
Of?
2:13:51
Well, for example, there is an African mother who has two
2:13:55
children, and she’s Catholic.
2:13:58
There are a lot of Catholics over in those countries.
2:14:03
That’s, my grandmother came from somewhere.
2:14:06
Not Africa, but Caribbean, or somewhere.
2:14:10
Frida, Frida’s little girl, had her first communion the other day.
2:14:18
What Frida did, and what I did, was we invited other Black people who we know are
2:14:24
Catholic but don’t come to church and we all just sat in a section supporting her.
2:14:31
It’s the little things, you know, that we do.
2:14:35
The priest yesterday told a story about his family who was highly,
2:14:39
they were bright and brilliant.
2:14:41
His dad was a doctor, but some dysfunction that made people crazy,
2:14:45
about the Black lady who came to their house to help his mother clean up or
2:14:50
straighten up, shielding him from one of his dad’s beatings, because his dad
2:14:56
would, you know, let the discipline go.
2:14:59
Then, when it would just get too bad he’d just come home
2:15:01
and beat all the kids [laughs]
2:15:05
. Well, after church I went to Father and said, thank you for that story.
2:15:13
These people need to hear that.
2:15:17
So, I guess you might say something concrete that I have done for that
2:15:21
church is to bring my Black ethics and my Black knowledge to it.
2:15:30
Ed and I brought the jazz music to the church.
2:15:34
But we not only brought the music, we told them this is a legitimate music form.
2:15:39
This
2:15:41
was what Black people played.
2:15:45
We don’t just do spirituals.
2:15:47
I gave a talk on the difference between spirituals and what’s the other one?
2:15:53
Spirituals and, is this a spiritual or is this a gospel song?
2:15:57
Yeah.
2:15:58
The difference between the two, and there is a difference.
2:16:00
Those kinds of things.
2:16:01
I think concretely you would say Ed and I are the, kind of the Black voice
2:16:07
of the Catholic church [laughs] . I mean, I never let them forget.
2:16:13
I don’t throw it in their faces every day, but I remind them.
2:16:18
Okay.
2:16:19
Yeah, but you know, you’ve not been Black and Catholic, Honey.
2:16:22
I’m telling you this is not news.
2:16:26
Speak up.
2:16:28
That’s the one concrete that I could say that I’ve contributed to: my household,
2:16:34
my neighborhood, NAACP I will speak.
2:16:38
I’ll go Black on them.
2:16:41
Okay, well, maybe with that last word, we can thank you very, very much.
2:16:48
You’re very, very welcome.
2:16:49
And I hope this is helpful to everybody who hears it.
2:16:54
It’s coming from my heart.
2:16:58
Yeah.
2:16:58
I’m just trying to say it like I know it.
2:17:02
It’s in my maturity and knowing a lot that I’m peaceful.
2:17:07
I can be peaceful.
2:17:10
Thank you so, so much.
2:17:11
You’re very welcome.
2:17:12
You’re very welcome.
