00:00
Interview with Richard Hunter on November 11, 2019.
00:08
Well, we’ve already been chatting for a while, getting to know a
00:13
little bit about you, but let us start all over, like we said.
00:17
So, let’s start with where you were born and kind of bring us up
00:23
to, then, how you came to Oregon.
00:29
Well, I was born in Portland July 18, 1953.
00:37
My parents were Archie and Bernice Hunter.
00:41
At that time they were living at
00:45
1801 North Vancouver Avenue.
00:47
This was before the freeway, I-5, was built.
00:57
It’s interesting because it was in a house that I thought was an apartment.
01:01
I thought somebody lived upstairs.
01:03
I’m not sure.
01:04
I think it was just a house.
01:07
But, it had one bedroom.
01:15
Me, I think it was about 5 brothers that slept in that one bedroom.
01:25
All on one big bed.
01:27
All on one big bed.
01:28
Then, my sisters, they slept in the living room, all in one bed
01:34
that they put out every night.
01:37
Then, we just had this one little old stove that everybody would stand
01:43
around in the morning to get warm.
01:46
There was this little nook area that my parents used for a bedroom.
01:53
It was tight quarters, but it was my humble beginnings.
02:01
Until
02:03
they decided to build the Memorial Coliseum and the I-5 freeway.
02:11
Everybody who lived in the area lost their homes and had to relocate.
02:20
My parents aren’t originally from Portland, Oregon.
02:25
My father was born in
02:29
Nacogdoches, Texas.
02:30
He was raised in Kirbyville, but he was born in Nacogdoches, Texas, in
02:39
1915.
02:39
My mother lived, she was born in Kountze, Texas, like around by 1921.
02:48
But my father, he, they lived on a farm and they ended up, he left home
02:58
when he was 14 years old because the way he felt about his dad.
03:06
Then he moved away and then when his father passed away, he came
03:12
back home to help his mother.
03:15
Then he went to Baytown College with his younger brother, Benjamin Hunter,
03:23
enrolled in school there in Baytown.
03:25
Then they ended up answering the call to Kaiser during the war.
03:31
Kaiser wanted ship builders.
03:36
They had just both graduated from Baytown and they came out here together
03:41
to Portland to work in the shipyards.
03:43
In
03:46
Kirbyville he had built his first home, because he was a carpenter,
03:50
and he had built his home that he and my four oldest siblings was living
03:54
in before they came to Portland.
03:57
But he came out here by himself.
04:01
He brought his younger brother with him, but his younger
04:05
brother got drafted in the Army.
04:08
He ended up not living in Portland any longer, but he
04:13
came out here, got established.
04:17
When he got a home, he sent for my mom and my four oldest
04:20
siblings, brought them out here.
04:25
They lived in Vanport for a while, and two weeks before the flood
04:29
came they moved to Guys Lake.
04:32
Then after the flood, they ended up at 1801 North Vancouver
04:38
Avenue where I was born.
04:40
At the time of the flood, did they actually lose everything?
04:44
Yeah.
04:45
Everybody did.
04:48
All of their material goods?
04:48
Uh-huh.
04:48
How did they gather up their wits to start again and rebuild
04:56
their own possessions and stuff?
04:56
Well, see
04:59
it was easy for my father because my father was a carpenter and a mason.
05:04
My father, he built his first home.
05:09
He also, despite the efforts of Portland Development Commission to
05:16
keep Blacks from buying property.
05:19
My father ended up owning property.
05:22
He would buy a house, he will fix it up and rent it out.
05:28
They were business, they were entrepreneurs.
05:32
They’ve had a number of businesses that kept them afloat.
05:37
My father, he worked for the railroad, because a lot of times, you’re not
05:42
going to be recognized as a carpenter in a good old boy’s school, and so
05:50
he was a, what do you call, the red caps?
05:56
For the railroads?
05:58
Those were the only jobs that they would allow Blacks to have.
06:03
But he worked 2 or 3 jobs a day.
06:05
He did his skills and helped do homes and stuff like that, but he
06:12
had his medical and stuff like that coming from the railroad with family.
06:17
Given that Blacks weren’t really allowed to buy property, how did he maneuver it
06:26
so he could?
06:26
Well, that, that I don’t really know because I knew that my father knew how to
06:34
save money, and he knew how to make money.
06:41
He also knew how to make friends.
06:43
Because my father was also,
06:47
when he came out here, a Mason, a Fraternal Order Mason.
06:56
He already had 33 degrees in the Masonic Lodge.
07:03
He came out—I think being in that fraternity gives you some
07:07
kind of connections and clout.
07:11
But he, Sovereign Grant Commander S.C. Marshall of the jurisdictions in Texas
07:21
gave him credentialing to come out here and to establish Oregon Lodge.
07:27
He
07:30
helped set up the Evergreen 2001 and the St. Joseph Lodge.
07:36
Were those lodges racially mixed?
07:39
No.
07:39
They were African American lodges.
07:42
There was a little trouble because the Prince Hall Lodge
07:48
kind of rejected Scottish Rights.
07:51
You know, the Scottish Right didn’t want to recognize the Prince Hall.
07:59
Prince Hall believed they had more of a right to be a part of that because of
08:05
those fraternal organizations originated in Egypt, and I think
08:11
Prince Hall was of the order of Misraim, and Misraim was the father
08:15
of the Egyptians and blah, blah, blah.
08:17
Anyway, the Scottish Right kind of looked at them as a clandestine lodge.
08:26
They don’t recognize them.
08:30
But, Prince Hall felt that way of the Scottish Right, you know?
08:35
They didn’t accept people like my father when my father first came out
08:39
here because he was Scottish Right.
08:43
But my father got permission from the Scottish Right to establish a
08:48
Scottish Right Masonic Lodge here in Portland, mostly African Americans.
08:56
I imagine he was with the first, just about
09:01
1944.
09:01
So, he came out here in 1945, and I owe a lot of knowledge that I have
09:11
gained to a man named Raymond Burrell, who was a historian, African American
09:19
historian and a member of Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church who
09:25
recently passed away because of cancer.
09:27
He’s
09:31
given me a lot of information.
09:32
He interviewed me about my father and he did research and found out
09:35
a lot of things that I didn’t know.
09:38
But when my father started that lodge, I believe that because of that
09:45
fraternal order, that might answer a lot of questions about how he was able
09:51
to get property and stuff like that.
09:55
There’s a lot of people, a lot of White real estate men,
09:58
who lost their jobs because of selling property to Black people.
10:04
But, my father managed.
10:09
He was a landlord.
10:11
He owned homes.
10:12
He didn’t have to pay nobody else to come fix the house.
10:16
He’d fix it up himself.
10:19
Let’s get onto, then, finally you were born.
10:23
Yeah.
10:24
Then
10:27
what?
10:27
I remember this
10:32
man by, this fella by the name of Teddy Nickels, because I remember
10:38
I was hanging on the banister.
10:42
I was playing and then slide down to the ground.
10:47
Once I was down on the ground one time, I think Teddy, he was a pretty big
10:51
fella, he decided to sit on the banister and it broke and he fell on top of me
11:00
[laughs] . I had a bloody nose and everything, but it wasn’t that bad.
11:04
I think most people thought it was funny more than anything else, but
11:10
I had an excellent childhood growing up in there for my first few years.
11:15
But, as soon as they decided to build a freeway, I think I might have been about
11:24
3 or 4 years old when we had to move, and then we ended up getting a place.
11:31
I don’t know if you’re familiar with Unthank Park?
11:35
In Portland?
11:36
Okay, well Unthank Park is also the property where Self-Enhancement
11:42
Incorporated, SEI, sits on that property.
11:47
Before there was SEI or Unthank Park, there were all homes.
11:52
We lived at
11:56
3955 North Haight Street.
11:59
That’s where I continued to grow up at.
12:03
What was that house like?
12:05
It was interesting because I think it had 3 bedrooms, had 3 bedrooms.
12:13
That was interesting.
12:14
It was a tiny house, but I thought it was big.
12:17
It had 3 bedrooms, and then my two older brothers, I think they
12:22
lived upstairs in the attic.
12:23
That’s where they slept.
12:26
My sisters all had a bedroom to themselves.
12:28
My mother and father had their bedroom, and all the boys, like again,
12:35
put me, Michael, Donald, Charles, I think Carl did sleep, I think Lee was the only
12:43
one had his own bedroom up in the attic.
12:47
We all slept there and we was in one bedroom for a minute
12:51
and then we got this bunk bed.
12:55
Then I remember, as I grew up older, I got my own bunk.
12:59
I slept on the bottom.
13:03
It was interesting.
13:05
I went to Boise-Eliot.
13:11
It was just Boise Elementary School at the time I went.
13:15
I think it was from
13:19
1958.
13:20
Yeah, I was born in ’53, so
13:26
I think I started in first grade at Boise.
13:30
I went there all 8 years.
13:33
When you were saying it was interesting, tell us some stories
13:36
about what made it interesting.
13:38
What made Haight Street interesting?
13:41
What made your life interesting then?
13:44
Well, the fact is I was a preacher’s kid.
13:47
My father was also an ordained minister and pastor, so he had pastored several
13:53
churches, even before I was born.
13:57
I grew up as a pastor’s kid, and we had a huge family.
14:01
How many were you altogether?
14:03
Actually, by
14:06
the time we moved was living there, I think there was a total of 10 siblings.
14:10
We weren’t all living there.
14:12
All the same mother, same father?
14:13
Yeah.
14:15
Of course, my father had a son by his first marriage in Texas.
14:21
When my oldest stepbrother came out of the service he came to live with us.
14:27
A matter of fact, he came to live with us when we was on Vancouver, 1801.
14:33
Then he followed us on over there.
14:35
But then he had to eventually move to California and started a family.
14:43
Life was different, because we had great use of our imagination growing up.
14:52
Everybody in my community had anywhere from 6 to 11 kids.
14:58
So, there was all big families.
15:02
Everybody looked out for everyone.
15:04
You were
15:08
never alone.
15:09
There was always a lot to do, a lot of people to play.
15:13
Every parent knew each other, and every parent had a call.
15:18
When it was time for you to come in the home, your mother
15:22
had a special call for you.
15:24
What was your mother’s call?
15:26
Oh, she would say—All Richard.
15:29
Or All Charles.
15:33
The friends would say, man, your momma’s calling you better go home.
15:38
Some mother’s had a little square bell they’d ring.
15:43
Some would have a little yoo-hoo call or something like that, but everybody knew
15:49
each person’s mother’s special call.
15:52
They would nudge you and say, man you need to go home, man.
15:53
Because your mother’s calling.
15:54
You’re going to get in trouble.
15:56
You don’t see that today.
15:57
People ignore their parents.
15:59
They got cell phones now and won’t come home when they’re supposed to.
16:05
Then, you couldn’t do anything in the community without being watched
16:10
and helped raised by other parents.
16:13
If I was getting on the bus, if I was going to the store—I admit that,
16:21
you know, I don’t know why I would do it, but I admit trying to take
16:26
something out the store and put it in my pocket, and then the mailman that
16:31
lived down the street from us that delivers our mail, he was in the store.
16:37
He said, little Hunter, now you know better than that.
16:40
You know your parents raised you better than that, blah, blah, blah.
16:44
I remember, even when I went to high school, even as maybe a
16:51
sophomore, I would skip class, and
16:57
we would be on the corner of the building with my friends smoking a cigarette.
17:02
Then, I’d get home and my momma said, Richard.
17:05
I said, what?
17:05
She said, come on in the kitchen for a minute.
17:08
I want to talk to you.
17:10
I go in the kitchen and she’d say.
17:12
So, tell me something, when did you start smoking cigarettes?
17:16
Now, how did my momma know I was outside smoking a cigarette?
17:21
Because all the parents worked together in the community.
17:25
So, one parent saw you doing something, your mom would find out about it.
17:29
If they had to whup you for something, you’d get another whupping for having
17:33
to get a whupping for doing something you weren’t supposed to be doing.
17:38
Even when I was in elementary school, I didn’t want to, my daddy bought
17:46
me, we weren’t, I guess you’d say we might have been poor in a way.
17:53
That’s a big family to take care of, and so we had to get a lot
17:56
of hand-me-down shoes and stuff.
17:58
I had some sandals my father gave me.
18:01
I said, I’m not going to school with no sandals on.
18:04
Kids would laugh at me and make me cry.
18:06
So,
18:09
he said, you’re going to school with them sandals.
18:12
So, I go to school, but I don’t go to school.
18:16
I ended up playing hooky for the whole day.
18:19
I played in the little parking lot of the grocery store and everything, and just
18:24
about the time when it was time to go to school to get out, I decided to go home.
18:30
My mother said, well, how was school today?
18:34
[Laughs] Oh, I said, it was alright.
18:37
It was a little boring.
18:38
She’d say, yeah, okay.
18:39
That’s interesting, because somebody said they saw you sitting on the curb
18:45
in the parking lot of More For Less and that you were just sitting there
18:51
just playing with rocks and stuff.
18:56
But now, you know, parents will get angry if you knew anything about their children.
19:04
They don’t respect that no more.
19:07
It was a whole different era that you—
19:09
What you’re saying is, if it’s a parent of a different child that’s monitoring
19:17
a child that’s not their own, the parent of that child would get angry.
19:19
Right.
19:23
Today.
19:24
Today.
19:24
Today, yeah.
19:25
Mm-hmm.
19:26
You try to tell somebody something bad that your child had done, and they’ll
19:32
tell you it ain’t none of your business.
19:35
They might want to pick a fight with you.
19:41
I grew up in a real well-respected environment and community,
19:46
a sense of community.
19:48
Everybody was together.
19:49
We learned so much.
19:50
It was told that our communities were
19:57
full of drugs and prostitution and crime, but
20:04
that wasn’t the way I grew up.
20:08
I found out later that it was worse in southeast Portland than it was
20:14
in the area—because they’re trying to destroy the Black community.
20:19
The way to destroy it is to label it, you know?
20:24
Anywhere Black people go, the neighborhood goes down.
20:30
The code name for Black people was blight.
20:34
They got a lot of urban renewal dollars for calling our neighborhood blight.
20:41
Sometimes we couldn’t do things in our neighborhoods, even with
20:44
my own father trying to get money.
20:47
They not only redlined us so you couldn’t buy property, but they also
20:53
kept the banks from loaning you money.
20:57
How can you repair your home and fix things up if you won’t
21:01
give us any money to do it?
21:04
It’s not that we can’t pay you back.
21:07
It’s not that we’re not honest.
21:09
We’re Black.
21:11
We got to do everything we can from keeping Black people from building an
21:16
economic base and improving themselves.
21:20
We’re trying to get rid of them, not keep them.
21:24
But, my father, he managed.
21:27
There
21:29
was a lot of... in my neighborhood, we had a lot of pastors, government workers,
21:36
school teachers—when you have that kind of community, where’s all the drugs and the
21:45
prostitution that they’re talking about?
21:49
Everybody, I don’t care who you are, even if you went out partying
21:53
on Saturday night, everybody went to church on Sunday morning.
21:59
The churches were full.
22:00
People respected preachers.
22:01
People respected people who call themselves Christians or
22:06
saved, whatever the case may be.
22:07
There was respect for that, even though they did whatever they wanted
22:10
to do with their own lifestyles.
22:14
I imagine that some people’s lifestyle is pretty shaky, you know, hypocritical,
22:20
and it may be the reason why people don’t have respect for churches or
22:26
religious people today, because they have such raggedy lifestyles themselves.
22:32
You were the son of a pastor.
22:35
Tell us a little bit about what that was like and how it influenced you.
22:38
Well, we—you get tired of going to church, because you went to church all the time.
22:48
You had to go to Sunday school.
22:49
You had to go to morning worship.
22:51
You had to come back home, and you might have to go back to a youth meeting.
22:57
There was always some church in the community as having a program or
23:01
some sort of from either a pastor’s anniversary, church anniversary, mission
23:05
department, women’s group—everybody had something every Sunday all the time.
23:09
You was always going, going, going, going.
23:12
You’d get so mad as a kid, because you’re watching this TV show,
23:16
somebody: come on, let’s go.
23:18
It’s time to go.
23:19
I don’t want to go to church.
23:20
I want to watch Outer Limits, or I want to watch Star Trek or something like that.
23:25
But, no, you got to go to church.
23:28
As you grew up in the church, I grew up being actively involved, even as
23:33
a junior usher, as a youth leader,
23:41
singing in all the choirs, from the youth choir to adult.
23:44
I ended up directing the choir, playing the piano for the choir, and I guess
23:53
the influence comes from the fact that
23:57
people was always telling me you’re going to be a preacher just like your daddy.
24:01
I said, you must be crazy.
24:03
No, no.
24:06
An old woman told me that all the time.
24:07
She said, you’re going to be a preacher just like your father.
24:09
I said, no.
24:11
I think you got me mixed up with some of my other brothers or something.
24:14
So, I did become a preacher.
24:20
You were saying a youth leader.
24:21
What were some of the activities that you did as a youth leader?
24:25
As a youth leader, mostly catechism.
24:34
We had competition for learning Bible verses and memorizing books of the Bible
24:40
and certain types of scriptures that might be salvation scriptures, promise
24:46
scriptures, things of that nature.
24:50
Then, you know, just organizing and planning different kinds of activities
24:56
for the young people or whatever
24:59
it’d be.
25:00
What kind of activities?
25:00
Mostly fun activities, like picnics and parties and stuff like that.
25:06
This was outside of the regular Bible study and meetings that we would have.
25:12
Can you give us any stories about some of those activities, something
25:16
specific that you organized and how it worked and what happened and so on?
25:22
Well, I know
25:26
we used to play a game sometimes to teach people that sometimes
25:33
the way gossip can be detrimental, because sometimes when it’s first told it doesn’t
25:40
always come out the same way when it’s being told over and over and over again.
25:45
We’d have everybody line up in a line.
25:50
The first person would tell a person behind them something.
25:54
They were supposed to turn, in turn, turn and tell the person
25:57
behind them what they heard.
26:00
By the time it gets to the back of the line, that person is
26:03
told something totally different from what the first person said.
26:08
That was always a fun game that teaches us not always to listen to gossip,
26:14
that if you wanted to know something go to the first person and ask them.
26:21
What were some other games
26:27
or activities?
26:29
Just the Bible verses memorization and stuff.
26:35
I think we
26:38
gave a lot of music to the kids, because music was a big thing in our
26:44
church and we had so much talent.
26:49
But I think the only reason why I think I was really excited about being in
26:54
the youth department because I think the young lady that I was working with,
26:59
I think we kind of liked each other.
27:02
So, we was very committed to the youth program because we would
27:05
see each other all the time.
27:09
We’ve never, nothing ever became of that, but I think that’s one of the highlights
27:15
of working with the youth department.
27:16
So, that kind of the source of your first girlfriends?
27:20
Well, you might say that.
27:24
I guess you could say that.
27:25
We are great friends today.
27:30
We all have been married and have lots of kids and grandchildren, but we’re
27:37
still good friends even to this day.
27:41
What was your schooling like?
27:43
You
27:46
know, one thing I didn’t say about myself is I’ve always
27:52
spent a lot of time to myself.
27:54
My mother has always said I was like that, that I’m always playing by myself.
28:05
I was kind of like stand-offish a lot and watching other people.
28:13
People look at me today, you would never believe I was an introvert.
28:17
I tell people today that I’m still an introvert.
28:20
I’m an introvert that’s forced to be an extrovert.
28:26
I’d rather not be involved with a lot of people, but how can
28:32
you get away from a big family?
28:34
You have all these brothers and sisters.
28:37
I benefited from that because I was well-protected.
28:42
My family was well-known.
28:44
People knew my older brothers and siblings.
28:45
Nobody would never mess with me because I was Charles’s brother.
28:50
I was Lee or Carl’s brother.
28:52
Nobody messed with them.
28:56
I lived in the shadow of a lot of my older siblings.
28:59
I lived, my brother Charles, I
29:04
still live in his shadow.
29:06
People see me sometimes, and they’ll say Charles.
29:09
I’ll say, no.
29:10
No.
29:11
that’s my brother.
29:12
Charles is your brother?
29:13
Blah, blah, blah.
29:15
A lot of people, I talk to them today and we’ll be in conversation and
29:23
they may not be that excited about me when they’re talking to me until
29:25
they find out I’m Charles’s brother.
29:29
Oh, you’re Charles’s brother?
29:31
Blah, blah, blah.
29:32
Then the conversation gets more exciting and everything.
29:35
I’m like, oh, I’m special now, because I’m Charles’s brother.
29:38
How did that make you feel?
29:42
It was never a bad thing, because there was great benefit from that.
29:46
All through grade school he was the man that was in charge of our bedroom.
29:55
He always had these grand ideas about what was going to go here, what was
29:59
going to go there, as we were growing up.
30:02
We would play church sometimes.
30:03
He was always the preacher.
30:09
Even after elementary school into high school, I followed him.
30:13
He was a senior when I was a freshman.
30:17
Everybody, that’s little Hunter, Charles Hunter’s brother.
30:24
I did that into college, because he was at the college I went to
30:29
in Southern Oregon University.
30:33
People find out I was Charles’s brother.
30:36
I got all kinds of perks.
30:37
I enjoyed it,
30:42
because being Charles Hunter’s brother, that was the bomb
30:48
diggity.
30:48
You had a lot of clout as Charles Hunter’s brother.
30:53
In school, then, tell us about what
30:59
the school itself was like.
31:00
It was a predominantly Black
31:03
school.
31:06
Everybody that went to the school, we all lived in the same community.
31:14
The learning was great and everything.
31:19
I think I experienced how some teachers don’t always understand their students.
31:28
Sometimes you can think that maybe you’re not as smart as you should be.
31:36
You’re not excelling here.
31:37
You’re not excelling there, and maybe you’re getting Cs and Ds and a few Ss or
31:46
Us, for Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory.
31:49
Then, sixth grade I get this male teacher who’s Hispanic, Mr. Bonelia.
31:58
I got straight Es that year.
32:03
There was something about Mr. Bonelia that connected to me.
32:08
He made me excel.
32:10
He understood me.
32:12
I
32:14
was able to do great things under his tutelage.
32:20
The other teachers didn’t have what Mr. Bonelia had.
32:27
That’s what’s lost in teaching sometimes.
32:31
There’s a disconnect,
32:35
the lack of the ability to bring the best out of a student.
32:39
I think that if more teachers was like Mr. Bonelia, we’d have
32:44
a lot of successful students.
32:46
So, that was elementary
32:51
school.
32:51
That was elementary.
32:52
Tell us about junior high.
32:52
Well, that’s when I first started playing the trumpet.
32:54
When I got into the fifth grade, they asked who had an interest in music.
33:01
If you had an interest in music, what kind of instrument you think
33:04
you might like to try to play?
33:06
For some reason, I wanted to play the trumpet.
33:10
I started playing the trumpet.
33:11
I remember learning how to play and everything.
33:15
It was easy for me to learn how to read music.
33:18
The hard part was disciplining your lip.
33:21
I had a few busted lips from playing the trumpet until you build your
33:25
lip up nice and strong until you can [makes blowing noise] , you know.
33:31
We had concerts in our elementary school.
33:33
Our elementary school bands played.
33:36
Elementary or junior high?
33:38
Elementary.
33:38
Well, the thing about it there is they didn’t have junior high
33:41
when I was going to school.
33:42
They just had 1 through 8.
33:46
Now they have middle schools and junior high, but they didn’t have it then.
33:50
They just had straight K through
33:56
8.
33:56
It was, actually, the sixth, seventh, and eighth grade that
33:59
I actually was a trumpet player.
34:03
Now, the way that worked with all of the elementary schools during
34:06
that time had music programs.
34:09
Everybody was coming out of elementary schools already
34:13
knowing how to play an instrument.
34:15
So, they fed into the high schools.
34:18
Boise fed into Jefferson High School.
34:21
I didn’t have to go to Jefferson and learn how to play the trumpet.
34:25
I already knew how to play the trumpet, so I fit right into the band.
34:29
I played fourth chair my freshman year, third chair my sophomore
34:33
year, and then I graduated to first chair in my junior and senior year.
34:40
It was just, that’s music.
34:42
I remember playing as a little boy, playing at Christmas program
34:46
at church, playing the trumpet.
34:46
What kind of music did you play?
34:47
Well, we learned various pieces by... you know,
35:03
I can’t even remember.
35:08
I’m trying to figure out, remember what the genre was of playing, but
35:14
it wasn’t like we was learning how to play soul music or anything like that.
35:19
We were playing what people all across the country were playing
35:23
in these elementary school bands.
35:26
We was getting learning knowledge about Beethoven and a lot of different
35:37
brass instrument pieces, whatever the case would be.
35:42
We didn’t have orchestra, so we didn’t have stringed instruments
35:47
in elementary, not at our school.
35:51
It was more like a concert band type thing.
35:54
When I got to high school, then they had all the stringed instruments,
35:57
because I played in the orchestra, this concert band, the pep band
36:01
doing basketball games, and the marching band doing football games.
36:08
We began to learn a lot of different things and exposed to
36:11
all different kinds of music,
36:15
but I did have a little soul band that I played in.
36:18
I played the trumpet.
36:19
The few guys that were in the band we started our own little group, and
36:23
we were called The Soul Excursions.
36:25
I remember playing for a few gigs in the city.
36:30
I remember we played once for a high school dance.
36:34
How did you do in high school academically?
36:38
Academically, I did poor.
36:41
I graduated, and it was okay then, I graduated with 2.0
36:47
in high school.
36:48
I don’t think you can graduate with 2.0 now.
36:54
Probably not.
36:54
[Laughs] I went to Southern Oregon State College.
36:56
I did not pass my SAT test,
37:04
but Charles was at SOC, and my father said, I want Richard to go to
37:11
school down there where you’re going.
37:14
So, because I was Charles Hunter’s brother, I didn’t need an SAT test
37:23
[smiles]
37:23
. Were you interested in academically?
37:26
No.
37:26
I was just going because that’s what my father wanted me to do.
37:29
I was there for a whole year, and then
37:34
it was a party town.
37:36
Actually, I lived like a king when I went to school there.
37:41
I did everything.
37:43
We did all the partying.
37:45
It was just really nice.
37:46
Enjoyed myself.
37:47
Then, I remember starting the next year they wanted, I had to
37:51
go get my financial aid packet.
37:53
They told me I had to go see the registrar’s office.
37:58
The reason they wanted me to go see because they wanted me to go home.
38:03
They said they don’t think I’m serious about school.
38:05
I wasn’t.
38:08
You weren’t particularly interested in the academics, but I wanted ask you what were
38:14
your interests as a child, your childhood?
38:19
I always loved music.
38:24
I was kind of sad because I don’t think I was getting the help I
38:29
needed to be a better musician, but
38:35
I was always there.
38:36
I was just, that was the think that interested me most, was music,
38:43
music, music, and the trumpet.
38:45
I was so in love with all the trumpet players.
38:49
They were so fascinating to me: Dizzy Gillespie, Hugh Masekela,
38:53
and all those guys, just like I want to play the trumpet like that.
38:58
Then I started learning about all the different kinds of trumpet.
39:01
I found later that even playing the trumpet, sometimes I always
39:06
thought the trumpet was hard to play.
39:09
But if you had enough money and you bought the right brand, playing the trumpet
39:16
would have been easy, smooth, because you’re playing on them cheap instruments
39:24
and you have to work harder to play.
39:27
But, when you buy a Selmer or something like that, you got a quality trumpet.
39:38
If you keep it clean and well-oiled, that thing just plays so smooth.
39:45
I said, how come I didn’t get one of these growing up?
39:48
Like I said, I feel sorry for people that have to grow up playing instruments
39:51
and have to play on cheap instruments.
39:55
That is not the best way to learn how to play anything.
39:57
But
39:59
money gets you quality.
40:05
I do remember
40:10
that because music’s such a good to me, I like it so much, I think
40:16
because I’m in tune to my feelings.
40:18
People who are musicians can feel things better than most folks.
40:24
I remember when John F. Kennedy got shot.
40:30
I actually cried.
40:33
I don’t know how many people did.
40:34
I don’t know how many Black people did, but as a little boy sat there watching on
40:40
TV, watched his head almost falling off.
40:45
When I was a little boy, I used to come home from school and I
40:48
used to watch a program on TV that John F. Kennedy produced.
40:54
It was called Profiles In Courage.
40:58
Have you ever heard of that before?
40:59
Mm-hmm.
41:00
They would do this piece on famous Americans.
41:04
It wouldn’t just be about White people.
41:08
Sometimes it was about Black people or Native Americans, but
41:11
it’s called Profiles in Courage.
41:14
I found my—I said, I love that.
41:16
I was so passionate about stuff like that.
41:21
But I was, like I said, I was an introvert and quiet.
41:24
Everybody would be out playing sometimes; I’ll be sitting there on
41:29
the sidewalk with chalk by myself.
41:36
I’m that way today.
41:37
I love being by myself.
41:38
Today I’m ready to get out of this place so I can have this solitude that I need.
41:48
I don’t want to share things with people.
41:53
I think that’s probably why I feel, maybe I feel better being single [laughs]
42:02
. Martin Luther King—I grew up because my parents, my father was a pastor,
42:10
I grew up every Sunday morning after Martin Luther King got killed...
42:13
and I don’t know how many people had the opportunity to do that.
42:17
I think everybody, you don’t really know Martin Luther King unless
42:21
you know him for what he was.
42:22
He wasn’t a civil rights leader.
42:23
He was a preacher.
42:26
He was a pastor.
42:28
Every Sunday morning I listened to one of Martin Luther King’s sermons,
42:33
because my mother be cooking in the kitchen getting ready for Sunday and
42:36
she would always play his program.
42:40
That is something I wish every child could have done, was to hear
42:45
his sermons every Sunday morning.
42:47
Why is that?
42:49
I mean, I would go and listen to other people’s preaching.
42:52
I said, you know, I’ll come back here and preach like Martin Luther King.
42:56
Because Martin Luther King was a great preacher.
42:59
He’d break things down, make you understand it.
43:04
Then, that’s the reason why I feel so passionate about certain scriptures in
43:08
the Bible, because when I look at White churches and even Black churches and
43:13
people, you know, I’ll say, you know, if they, they say they read the Bible.
43:21
I’m sure they might have run across Isaiah 51?
43:25
Or
43:30
is that?
43:31
What
43:35
it is?
43:36
Or Isaiah 58.
43:37
Any church that knows the Bible, how can you have Isaiah 58 and still allow
43:45
slavery or racism or anything like that?
43:47
Repeat Isaiah 58 is.
43:49
Isaiah 58, oh I’m getting in trouble now.
43:54
Okay.
43:56
The gist of Isaiah 58 is that, you know, it was about the
44:00
fasting that the Jews were doing.
44:02
It became like a custom to put on sackcloth and ashes and to be sad and to
44:08
come before the lord and boom, boom, boom.
44:11
I guess the lord was kind of getting tired of it, because it’s almost like you’re
44:17
not really getting the picture here.
44:21
It’s not about fasting.
44:22
What
44:26
is the fasting God would be pleased with?
44:29
That’s what the prophet was saying.
44:30
Is this not the fast that I have chosen that you undue the heavy burdens?
44:36
That you set them who are captive free?
44:39
That you feed the hungry?
44:41
That you take care of the immigrant?
44:43
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
44:43
You know?
44:44
So, how can any Christian in any Christian church read Isaiah 58
44:52
and refuse to set the captive free?
44:56
Or even President Trump, you know?
45:00
People make him out to be like God put him there.
45:07
Even Trump, has he ever read Isaiah 58?
45:13
But, no.
45:14
The truth comes out that people who call themselves religious are
45:21
some of our greatest oppressors.
45:24
I’ve been always in tune to that.
45:27
Maybe that’s why I’ve
45:30
kept to myself.
45:31
I look at the world and see things going on.
45:33
I don’t understand why, because it seems like it’s a no-brainer.
45:37
It’s easy to do right.
45:40
Why do people spend so much time and energy doing wrong?
45:43
I don’t know.
45:46
You were saying more things about your childhood that you wanted to talk about.
45:51
Yeah.
45:55
I have a great imagination.
45:58
Maybe that’s the musician in me.
46:01
I don’t know.
46:02
But, they always say that an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.
46:08
Maybe it wasn’t good for me to keep to myself a lot, because then you know
46:13
I, there’s nobody help check my mind.
46:16
I
46:24
try to be popular.
46:27
I try to do what everybody else do.
46:30
Everybody’s smoking weed; I’ll smoke weed.
46:33
Boom, boom,
46:35
boom.
46:36
Because everybody had it.
46:38
It seemed like everybody was doing it.
46:41
I know everybody wasn’t doing it, but it seemed like that in the ‘60s and ‘70s.
46:48
I had a friend of mine that we hung out together.
46:50
We was best friends.
46:51
He lived right across the street from me.
46:54
We had this hippie friend that had drugs.
47:00
He always get new stuff in.
47:01
We would always try it out.
47:05
So,
47:09
we start experimenting with a lot of different stuff.
47:12
I experimented with stuff I wish I had never touched before.
47:17
I never got hooked on drugs like a lot of people do.
47:20
They used some of the stuff I’ve tried and they’re hooked
47:25
on it, and they go downhill.
47:27
I
47:31
had some bad experiences, you know?
47:34
But, like I said, I don’t want nothing to do with that no more.
47:40
My friend, on the other hand, he continued, continued, continued.
47:46
I remember when I got saved, because I had, I think using drugs made me
47:53
paranoid, or, anything like this.
47:56
I would just, I even had suicidal tendencies.
48:00
I couldn’t take my life, but I kind of didn’t want to life.
48:06
One day, I was in my apartment, and I prayed and I prayed, and I said, God help
48:15
me here.
48:17
Then something started, like I was dizzy, like I was going
48:22
around in circles to the left.
48:25
I was going around to the right at the same time, like centrifugal force.
48:31
Then I was kind of off the ground in mid-air, and then there was this peace.
48:42
I had never known any peace like that ever could exist.
48:44
It
48:49
was like, how do you express it?
48:51
I said, well, you remember Spock on Trek?
48:55
He does the Vulcan mind grip?
48:57
Everything that he knows you can know.
49:02
That was my only way I can describe my communication with God at that time.
49:10
It was like saying, well, if you go out and you preach for me, you,
49:13
boom, boom, boom, live for me, you could have this peace forever
49:21
when it comes time
49:25
for it.
49:25
But I couldn’t believe that I was up in the air.
49:28
So, I opened my eyes and I wasn’t up in the air.
49:30
I was on my knees on the floor.
49:32
I had my elbows in a pool of tears that I had done.
49:36
I got a butter-soft vinyl couch that made it look like that.
49:41
I said, oh, wait a minute, I’m in communication with God!
49:43
I tried to get the connection back again, and it wasn’t the same.
49:48
It was still there, but it was a little faint.
49:50
Called
49:53
my father, and I said, how do you know when you’ve been called to preach?
49:59
Well, my father, he dropped everything he was doing, came straight over to
50:02
my house, read a couple of scriptures to me, had prayer with me, and
50:07
scheduled me to preach the next Sunday.
50:12
He had one of his preacher friends that was there that was one
50:16
of his partners in the trades, because he was a master painter.
50:20
He don’t need tape to put on anything.
50:22
He can just paint a straight line just like nobody.
50:27
But he came there, but he was also a preacher.
50:30
He was very spiritual.
50:35
My father told him that I’m going to preach my first sermon.
50:39
I had a problem as a little boy of explaining myself, expressing myself.
50:44
How old were you then?
50:46
At the time that I got called to preach?
50:48
Yeah.
50:48
I was probably
50:53
21, 22?
50:55
Something like that.
50:59
But as a young boy, my family teased me because they say that
51:04
my speech, I didn’t know how to express myself, explain myself.
51:08
They’d act like they couldn’t understand what I was saying.
51:11
My older brother was in the congregation when I preached my first sermon.
51:17
Right in the middle of my message, Reverend Fury stood up:
51:22
God called Richard to preach!
51:24
God called Richard to preach!
51:26
God called Richard to preach!
51:29
I finished preaching and then after the service was over, my oldest
51:33
brother said, I know God called you to preach because I understood everything
51:43
you said.
51:43
Do you remember?
51:43
Hm?
51:47
Do you remember what you preached on that particular day?
51:48
Mm-hmm.
51:48
What kind of—
51:48
I preached on the 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians.
51:51
Tell us about that.
51:51
About love.
51:54
You know, if I have, if I give my body to be burned, give all my
51:59
goods to feed the poor, and I have not loved, it profits me nothing.
52:04
You know?
52:06
So, that’s the love chapter in the Bible, 1 Corinthians
52:12
13.
52:12
But, no, that, and I was committed.
52:15
I was dedicated.
52:17
I had thought that if you get saved that you couldn’t listen to jazz
52:22
anymore, soul music, anything like that.
52:24
I had a big collection of albums, of all the latest of Black groups: Bootsie,
52:34
Rubberband, The Stylistics, OJ, everybody, I had a big stack of
52:37
albums, the whole stack itself could have been worth about $500.
52:44
I thought I had to get rid of them, so I gave them to my father.
52:49
He had a secondhand store on 15th and Alberta.
52:53
I say, here.
52:54
Maybe you can sell these in your secondhand store.
52:56
For one day I went there to find out, how did you do on selling my records?
53:01
He said, oh, some guy came by here.
53:03
I told him give me $10 to take them off my hand.
53:07
I said, no you didn’t!
53:10
Later on, as I matured, I found out I didn’t have to give up my albums
53:17
[laughs] . You’re not unsaved because you have that music, whatever the case may be.
53:21
I said, man, I could have kept all of those albums.
53:26
Those albums would have been worth money today.
53:29
But, you know,
53:33
we learned.
53:34
Sometimes we get exposed to bad teaching.
53:37
I don’t think I really got, say I got bad teaching from my parents, but there’s a
53:43
lot of bad teaching in our communities about what Christianity is all about.
53:49
What are some of those?
53:52
Well, I always tell people this,
53:56
because Jesus had the same problem with the people in his day and
53:59
they always want to come and try to trick him and ask him questions.
54:03
Like, the disciples came and said, Master which is the greatest commandment?
54:07
They were arguing about, you know, this is the greatest commandment
54:09
over here, this is the greatest.
54:12
So, Jesus, which is the greatest commandment?
54:14
Jesus said, well, thou shall love the Lord with all thy heart, with
54:18
all thy soul, with all thy strength, and with all thy might, and the
54:22
second is like unto that—you should treat your neighbor like yourself.
54:25
On these two hang all the law and the prophets.
54:31
Then they want to try and trip him again.
54:33
Well, who is my neighbor.
54:35
So, he tells them about the road to Jericho and how when the priests, the
54:41
rabbis saw him he walked by on the side.
54:44
The priests walked by on the other side, but the Samaritan stopped and bandaged
54:53
the man up, gave him his clothes, and took him to a hotel and paid the man,
54:58
and said if there’s anything else over this let me know I’ll pay it.
55:04
So, he said, who was that man’s neighbor?
55:07
That’s what it’s all about.
55:08
Jesus said, by this shall all men know that you’re my disciples—if
55:11
you have love, one toward the other.
55:16
So, even Jesus in the sermon at the mount.
55:19
He was talking to the woman at the well.
55:24
They say on the mountain is where you worship God.
55:28
They say in Jerusalem you should worship God.
55:32
Jesus said, there will come a time, and now is, where you won’t go to
55:36
Jerusalem nor to the mountain to worship God, but true worshipers will
55:46
worship Him in spirit and in truth for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.
55:49
I always had that problem with all our churches in the community.
55:52
We’re building all these great cathedrals and empires and stuff like that, but
55:57
that’s not what God asked us to do.
56:00
What He asked us to do is to live together, love each other, and
56:04
work to make sure that we have a nice, workable, livable society to
56:09
live in honoring each other, but
56:13
sometimes our churches miss the mark on that.
56:16
Churches, synagogues, the Muslims, you know?
56:21
I think the only people that seem like they understand stuff is
56:24
Buddhists and the Unitarian churches
56:31
[laughs] . Everybody else, they’re rivalries—you’re not part of me,
56:33
you’re not part of the right group.
56:37
There is no right group.
56:38
There’s just right living.
56:40
Tell us a little bit about practically, then, so you went through high school.
56:46
Mm-hmm.
56:47
Then what did you do and how did you earn a living?
56:51
Well, I, like I said, I became
56:55
ordained at an early age.
56:58
I was in my early 20s.
57:01
You mentioned, I’ll interrupt you a minute, because you
57:02
mentioned that you were
57:07
in an apartment when you had your….
57:11
Yeah.
57:13
So, when did you, you lived in home.
57:15
It was my first apartment, though.
57:17
Tell us about how—so, the first place you lived with your...
57:21
Wait a minute.
57:21
It might have been my first apartment.
57:22
It might have been, yeah, it maybe was my first apartment.
57:24
So, let’s get the chronology.
57:28
You have the house that you lived in where—
57:32
Right.
57:33
When they built Unthank Park, because that was another thing that forced all
57:37
the families to move out of that area, my father bought the house across the street.
57:44
It was doing what they call the Urban Neighborhood Improvement Project in the
57:51
‘60s.
57:51
Some people were getting loans to repair the house.
57:56
My father was getting loans, but my father was one of the only ones
58:00
who was doing the work himself.
58:06
I finished growing up at 3960 North Haight Street.
58:12
We moved there just in my last few years of grade school.
58:17
I finished high school living there.
58:23
What was your question?
58:24
Now you finished high school?
58:26
I finished high school.
58:27
Now what did you do?
58:27
I went to college at Southern Oregon State College.
58:30
Still living at home with your parents?
58:33
Yeah.
58:34
When I came back my mother co-signed for a loan for school for me.
58:41
When I came back, I got me a job.
58:46
What job?
58:48
At...
58:53
I can’t remember that first job I had.
58:56
That
59:01
is very interesting.
59:03
I got a job.
59:05
After that, I got a job at the airport.
59:08
I was working at Sky Chef in the flight kitchen.
59:14
When I was in high school, they had training program through Oregon Department
59:19
of Transportation for civil engineering.
59:23
I was in that class, and they would take us out once a month
59:30
and show us different things.
59:32
They hadn’t even built the Fremont Bridge yet.
59:35
They just had the concrete pillars.
59:37
So, we was able to climb up on top of the pillar and take a
59:42
look over the city of Portland.
59:44
We were working with the civil engineers who were designing everything.
59:51
When I graduated from high school during the summer I worked with the survey crew.
59:57
We blue-topped I-217.
1:00:01
That was when there was nothing but dirt for miles and miles.
1:00:04
It wasn’t a freeway yet.
1:00:05
I don’t know if you know anything about blue-topping.
1:00:09
The survey crew goes and
1:00:14
measures everything and then you take these little wooden stakes,
1:00:19
and they say the people with the blue doors, or whatever, they
1:00:24
have to shave off the ground.
1:00:26
If we hammer that thing, if you go below the ground you have
1:00:30
the shave it down to the blue
1:00:34
spray paint to be put on top of the hub.
1:00:37
If it’s sticking up out of the ground, they have to fill it up to that point.
1:00:41
We did that all through the length of I-217 all summer long.
1:00:49
I had the suntan to prove it.
1:00:52
At that time, I had just before I started that job I was in
1:00:58
my kitchen cooking some food,
1:01:02
frying some French fries.
1:01:04
That was a big thing on Saturday morning—a cartoon was on.
1:01:08
I had the skillet heating up, and I, my mother had her buffet table there
1:01:13
with a little mirror over the wall.
1:01:16
You could see the kitchen.
1:01:18
I was watching cartoons, and I noticed in the mirror there was some
1:01:22
flames, and the skillet was on fire.
1:01:25
I took it and I put it in the sink and turn on the water.
1:01:31
You don’t do that and [makes whooshing sound and sweeps hands over and above
1:01:37
face] : singed my face, burned my mother’s curtains and everything.
1:01:41
I was peeled this way and all over here [sweeps fingers across forehead
1:01:45
and under eyes and cheeks] . I remember the driver’s license I had.
1:01:46
I had to get my first driver’s license had me with burns on my face.
1:01:53
I put cocoa butter on there for six months until my color came back.
1:02:00
I was out there blue topping.
1:02:02
I was dirtying up my momma’s bathtub.
1:02:06
Every time I came home from that job, I get in that tub and boy it
1:02:10
be just big dirty ring around the tub, all that dirt and everything.
1:02:15
That
1:02:18
really was the first job, because that was right out of high school.
1:02:27
What were the other people who worked on the job?
1:02:28
Was your relation with them?
1:02:29
With the, you’re talking about the survey crew?
1:02:30
Yes.
1:02:31
Just wondering, just describe?
1:02:32
Okay.
1:02:33
Well, this is their work.
1:02:35
They do this for a living.
1:02:36
They do this all the time.
1:02:37
I was just a student that was in the training program that got to
1:02:41
work with them for the summer.
1:02:44
They were really nice people.
1:02:46
I learned how to drive a stick with them.
1:02:49
They told me that if you don’t know how to drive a stick,
1:02:51
you don’t know how to drive.
1:02:54
I almost stripped the gears a couple of times, but they let me learn
1:03:00
how to drive that survey truck.
1:03:03
Wonderful people.
1:03:05
As a matter of fact,
1:03:09
one of the guys that trained me when I was working at the airport,
1:03:15
I ran into the guy, Mr. Butler, and he say, hey how you doing?
1:03:19
I said, I’m doing alright.
1:03:20
He said, are you looking for work?
1:03:21
I said, well, anything be better than what I got.
1:03:24
He said, well, you, we are trying to hire and you were one of our better students.
1:03:29
Come on down and I’ll get you a job.
1:03:31
So, I started working for the highway division again.
1:03:35
Not with the survey crew, but I worked in advertently for them,
1:03:39
because they were in, and one of the guys was one of the teachers, he
1:03:42
became my good friend and my mentor.
1:03:47
I worked for
1:03:50
them for about 6 years.
1:03:51
I was pastoring, too.
1:03:51
I had some kind of strange idea that a pastor shouldn’t be working a job,
1:03:59
he should be pastoring full-time.
1:04:03
That’s before, people think like that are not really thinking.
1:04:07
So, I quit my job after 6 years with the highway division and
1:04:12
moved full-time into the ministry.
1:04:16
Worst mistake I ever made.
1:04:18
I brought so much financial hardship on my family.
1:04:23
I ended up with an itch all over my entire body.
1:04:28
It was so bad, that I prayed that Lord, will you stop the itch
1:04:32
or take my life—one of the two.
1:04:34
I would go to see a dermatologist for like 3 months and they couldn’t find
1:04:38
no known physical cause for my itching.
1:04:41
I never told them I was a pastor.
1:04:44
I never told them what happened.
1:04:47
But when I did, they said, well that explains it.
1:04:50
Because they were attributing to a high level of stress.
1:04:54
Then, Coca Cola, I was involved with the employment department,
1:05:02
with a job search and training.
1:05:05
Then one lady thought I was ready, so she gave me a lead to Coca Cola.
1:05:12
She said, Coca Cola is hiring, boom, boom.
1:05:14
So, I always liked to do research, because I don’t care who you are I
1:05:19
want to know about you before I go.
1:05:22
I did some research on Coca Cola, and then I went down to Coca
1:05:25
Cola and I did an interview.
1:05:28
They asked me, well, tell me something, what do you know about Coca Cola?
1:05:33
Well, I know that Dr. Pemberton sold his headache tonic recipe to Asa Candler and
1:05:43
that the first glass of Coca Cola was sold for 5 cents a glass at Jacob’s Pharmacy
1:05:47
on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia.
1:05:50
He said, I didn’t even
1:05:54
know that.
1:05:54
So, I did my homework.
1:05:56
He said, well, we’ll get back to you.
1:05:59
I couldn’t get home.
1:05:59
My wife told me Coca Cola called and wanted me to come back up there.
1:06:03
I went back up there, and they asked me when can I start?
1:06:07
You had been, so
1:06:10
what made you understand that you should work while you’re being a pastor.
1:06:14
Well, you got to have money to feed your family.
1:06:17
You can’t just stop, you know.
1:06:18
The church had no financial way to fully support me as a full-time
1:06:23
pastor, so it was foolish to make that choice to do that.
1:06:29
It was foolish to make that choice without consulting your wife.
1:06:31
Tell us a little bit about that family, then, that you had with
1:06:37
your first wife and the children?
1:06:40
It’s interesting.
1:06:42
She’s the mother of all my kids.
1:06:49
I don’t think she...
1:06:53
I robbed the cradle.
1:06:57
I was 24 when I met her.
1:06:59
She was 16.
1:07:02
I was trying to start this youth
1:07:06
fellowship amongst the different churches with this other minister friend of mine.
1:07:13
She just like, when I was sitting in church, she stuck out like a sore thumb.
1:07:19
She just seemed like as a young person she was so dedicated and she loved the Lord.
1:07:23
Boom, boom, boom.
1:07:24
So, I wanted her to be a part of our group.
1:07:28
I’d meet with her mother, and the mother’s trying to get me
1:07:30
hooked up with her daughter.
1:07:31
The mother said, you know,
1:07:35
I made some freezer wine.
1:07:36
You want some?
1:07:39
I said, sure.
1:07:40
We were drinking freezer wine.
1:07:43
Did you say freezer wine?
1:07:44
Freezer wine, yeah.
1:07:45
What is that?
1:07:46
That’s a wine that you can make that you can put in the
1:07:49
freezer but it doesn’t freeze.
1:07:53
Does that make sense?
1:07:55
Well, alcohol, it just does...
1:07:56
It’s cold.
1:07:56
Well,
1:07:59
you put wine in the freezer, it’ll freeze.
1:08:01
It’ll get slushy.
1:08:02
It will get slushy.
1:08:02
Well, yeah, it was slushy, though.
1:08:05
It was slushy.
1:08:07
But it doesn’t freeze hard.
1:08:10
But it was good.
1:08:11
It
1:08:14
was really good.
1:08:14
Next thing I know, she was telling me, you know, well, you know you can take
1:08:17
my daughter out any time you want you.
1:08:19
I said, I’m not over here to take your daughter out.
1:08:22
You know?
1:08:24
But, her mom liked me.
1:08:28
I did like her, too.
1:08:29
We were getting together and everything,
1:08:33
and I think my father, he owned that secondhand store on
1:08:40
North East 15th and Alberta.
1:08:43
It’s called Bernie’s and Minnie’s Secondhand Store, named
1:08:45
after my mom and one of their
1:08:49
co-partners, Minnie Keys.
1:08:53
She
1:08:55
had a lot of stuff that was in the, antique stuff, stuff
1:08:57
like that, little consignment.
1:09:04
She rented an apartment to me next door to her house.
1:09:08
She had this big house, where it was an apartment, had the lower part
1:09:12
of it was one home for the one lady and the upstairs was an apartment.
1:09:17
It had one bedroom.
1:09:18
It had a kitchen, a living room.
1:09:20
It had a loft up there, a bathroom, everything.
1:09:25
Who was it that—?
1:09:25
$89 a month.
1:09:26
Who was it that rented the apartment?
1:09:29
My father’s business partner.
1:09:31
Yeah, okay.
1:09:32
I rented it from her.
1:09:35
For $89 a month, and that’s when I was dating Maxine.
1:09:43
Maxine came over to my house to visit, and during that time
1:09:49
Alberta, 15th and Alberta, that wasn’t a nice area back then.
1:09:54
Taxi cab drivers didn’t want to come in that neighborhood.
1:09:59
I called a cab for Maxine to get home.
1:10:04
The cab never came.
1:10:05
So I called again.
1:10:06
I said, hey, I called a cab.
1:10:07
He said, well, we’re sorry we’ve been really busy.
1:10:09
We’re going to be there shortly.
1:10:12
The cab never came.
1:10:13
They weren’t going to come.
1:10:16
It got too late for her to get, it was dark and it was too late.
1:10:21
So, we just said, you know, call her mom.
1:10:23
Said, you just have to spend the night and you’ll go home in the morning.
1:10:29
I let her sleep in my bed.
1:10:31
I slept on the couch.
1:10:35
Her mother was convinced that we’d done something, that we slept together.
1:10:39
We couldn’t convince her otherwise.
1:10:41
She got called all kinds of names and everything, but we didn’t do nothing.
1:10:47
The cab wouldn’t come, you know?
1:10:52
But I think to this day I think her mother really believed that something
1:10:57
did happen, but nothing happened.
1:11:04
When we got married, she moved into that apartment with me.
1:11:09
That’s the first time I had a rent increase.
1:11:12
It went from $89 to $119 [laughs]
1:11:18
. You can’t find rent like that no more.
1:11:20
I think, after that, when we moved into another apartment in southeast
1:11:23
Portland it went up to $350.
1:11:27
It started going up ever since then.
1:11:29
But, no, those were nice prices back then.
1:11:34
I did have a car.
1:11:36
One thing I didn’t say about going to college, there was an old man
1:11:39
that had this 1955 Buick Special.
1:11:42
He sold it to me for $99.
1:11:48
I was going to drive it home.
1:11:51
I was happy I got my own car and driving home and all of a sudden [makes thudding
1:11:55
noise] , the universal joint fell off.
1:11:59
My father had to drive down there and tow my car to Portland.
1:12:05
I got that fixed, but the car ran pretty good.
1:12:09
It was two-toned gray.
1:12:10
I put donuts on them, on the tires.
1:12:14
We was rolling down,
1:12:18
and that car could take scratches and nothing would happen to it.
1:12:20
When I had it at the college, I was driving and
1:12:26
I didn’t know anything about hydraulic brakes.
1:12:27
I didn’t know you had to pump them, anything like that.
1:12:31
I was parked on a hill, and I was facing toward an intersection
1:12:37
at the bottom of the hill.
1:12:39
I get in my car, and I’m driving down the hill, and I decide, I don’t wait like,
1:12:45
some people wait until they get to the corner and then they put on the brakes.
1:12:49
I start pumping my brakes when I’m halfway there, but nothing would happen.
1:12:54
I’m flooring it, and nothing is happening, so, I said, okay, ’m
1:12:58
not going into that intersection.
1:13:00
I pull over by these,
1:13:04
I don’t know if it was blackberry bushes or something like that.
1:13:08
I put much to that until the car kind of slowed down a little bit and then stopped.
1:13:14
That’s when I found out somebody said that you, it’s hydraulic brakes.
1:13:20
You have to pump
1:13:23
them.
1:13:29
I said, whew.
1:13:29
I had that car.
1:13:29
I was sure when I was driving around Portland with this nice two-tone,
1:13:34
green, ’55 Buick Special with donuts
1:13:42
[laughs]
1:13:42
. Now you’re in your apartment and you’re with your first wife.
1:13:46
Yes, we would have a glass of wine every night with dinner while we
1:13:52
listened to Barry White for six months.
1:13:55
Then, she got pregnant with my firstborn son.
1:14:01
Did she work at the time, or just—
1:14:04
No, she never.
1:14:06
Matter of fact, she was still in school.
1:14:08
Mm-hmm.
1:14:08
I dropped my wife off to school on my way to work.
1:14:11
So, in high school.
1:14:12
Yeah.
1:14:13
She was a senior in high school.
1:14:14
I took my wife to the prom [laughs]
1:14:19
. It was quite interesting.
1:14:22
We did everything, her father told us not to get married.
1:14:24
Her father told us to wait until we graduated from college to
1:14:29
think about getting married.
1:14:31
She said, well, I’ll be turning 18
1:14:36
on September the 18th.
1:14:37
We’re getting married on September 23rd.
1:14:41
When I’m grown, I will do what I want to do.
1:14:45
You were, at that time—
1:14:48
I was 26.
1:14:48
26. So, you were 8 years older.
1:14:49
It was 6 years.
1:14:49
She turned 18.
1:14:49
You were 26.
1:14:49
Was I 26?
1:14:49
Okay, then maybe I was 22 when she was 16.
1:14:49
Okay.
1:14:49
Because, there’s a 6-year difference.
1:14:49
Six years.
1:14:50
Mm-hmm.
1:15:10
But she was still 16 years old, you know.
1:15:13
That’s a big difference.
1:15:14
That’s robbing the cradle [laughs]
1:15:19
. Did you have a wedding?
1:15:20
We had our wedding in her father’s house.
1:15:23
Her father was married and had this nice home on 24th and,
1:15:28
that was just down the street here, not too far.
1:15:32
He had a swimming pool in the backyard.
1:15:34
I don’t know why we didn’t get married in the church.
1:15:38
Here I am getting a truck and hauling our church organ to her
1:15:42
father’s house for our wedding.
1:15:44
Why didn’t we just get married at the church?
1:15:46
I don’t know.
1:15:49
That was interesting.
1:15:50
I remember that I got the food for the catering, too.
1:15:57
My brother was working at Jefferson High School in the TJ room, and
1:16:02
he fixed all the food for us.
1:16:04
I had to pick it up and take it to my father-in-law’s house.
1:16:07
I had to get the organ, take it over there.
1:16:12
My wife didn’t, had a run in her stockings.
1:16:15
She needed a new pair of stockings, so I had to get her some stockings and
1:16:19
then after all of that, I told my best man, I said, you know we still have
1:16:24
to get showered and put our tuxes on.
1:16:28
I got to the point, said, well, I’m not rushing.
1:16:31
They cannot get married without me.
1:16:34
We just took our time and got dressed and everything and when
1:16:37
we got there, we got there.
1:16:40
They were wondering, what happened to Richard?
1:16:42
What happened to Richard?
1:16:44
Silly thing, her matron of honor was joking around and said, he
1:16:49
ran off with some other woman.
1:16:52
[Shakes head] that was a bad joke, bad joke.
1:16:58
I finally showed up, and we got married.
1:17:00
My father officiated my wedding.
1:17:07
She never wanted me to be a pastor.
1:17:10
She was there when the church had the meeting and my father
1:17:15
needed an assistant pastor.
1:17:18
My brother claimed that, well, he got up and he made a motion,
1:17:25
he said, I make a motion that we
1:17:29
close the nominations.
1:17:30
He said he did that because he didn’t want there to be a split-up between me and him.
1:17:36
I ended up being the assistant pastor.
1:17:39
My wife hated that.
1:17:40
She never wanted me to be the assistant pastor, and then when my father passed
1:17:45
away a year later, I became the pastor.
1:17:50
Why didn’t she want to be a pastor?
1:17:52
I don’t know why she didn’t, but she didn’t want to and everything she
1:17:58
seemed like she did from that point forward worked against... you know.
1:18:06
It was an interesting battle.
1:18:08
There was a lot of great things that happened at our church, a lot of growth.
1:18:14
I
1:18:17
got to the point where I was listening to other people,
1:18:21
especially people who thought maybe I was having marital problems and
1:18:24
say, well, you just need to resign.
1:18:25
Then,
1:18:29
I listened to other people and I did that and then I started to listening to God,
1:18:33
and God said I didn’t tell you to resign.
1:18:36
When I tried to go back, one of my deacons that came up under my
1:18:39
ministry said that I was wishy-washy.
1:18:44
First I said that I’m resigning and now I don’t want to resign.
1:18:49
That sounds wishy-washy.
1:18:52
What was the name of your church?
1:18:53
Neighborhood Church of God.
1:18:57
Neighborhood Church of God.
1:18:58
[Nods] Neighborhood Church of God.
1:18:58
My father founded it in 1961.
1:19:00
Mm-mm.
1:19:02
Yeah.
1:19:03
He was,
1:19:07
during the late ‘50s he had started a little congregation called Christian
1:19:16
Center in the old building where Mrs. Collins used to have her place, Grace
1:19:24
Collins of Memorial Christian Center.
1:19:27
She had a daycare and everything like that.
1:19:29
It’s now the Wonder Ballroom just around the corner over there on Russell Street.
1:19:38
So, he was having service there.
1:19:39
There was another Church of God congregation, because my
1:19:42
father had come over to the Church of God from the Baptist.
1:19:46
Reverend Victor Brown was having his congregation there and having service.
1:19:49
My father said, it doesn’t make sense for these two Church of God
1:19:53
congregations to be having services in the same building at different times.
1:19:57
He said, let’s come together and have one service.
1:20:01
As a matter of fact, I’m new to the Church of God.
1:20:04
So, why don’t you be the pastor?
1:20:07
I’ll be your assistant pastor for a couple years while I learn more about
1:20:11
the Church of God and then I’m going to go ahead and start my own church.
1:20:14
We did that.
1:20:16
For a while we were a part of Community Church of God.
1:20:19
Then in 1961 my father bought the property from Reverend Cheek, who was the
1:20:27
pastor of the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church.
1:20:30
Mt. Sinai Baptist Church had recently bought the church that we bought
1:20:35
from a Jewish congregation, called Congregation Tifereth Israel.
1:20:41
They had moved over to 15th and Wygant, in that building.
1:20:46
They sold that building to
1:20:49
Reverend Cheek, a Black congregation, that the White people in that area was upset
1:20:56
that they sold it to a Black congregation.
1:20:59
Anyway, they was telling what their Jewish charter says that they
1:21:03
don’t discriminate and everything.
1:21:07
My father was friends with Reverend Cheek, When Reverend Cheek bought
1:21:10
the place on 6th and Prescott, northeast 6th and Prescott, he
1:21:16
sold his old building to my father.
1:21:19
In 1961, we moved over there and started that church.
1:21:26
Going back then, so, how long were you married to your first wife?
1:21:30
We were married for 13 years.
1:21:32
How many children did you have?
1:21:34
We had 3 together.
1:21:37
We have a fourth one, but he was, you know, one of the reasons why we
1:21:47
got divorced was that my wife left me and she wanted to move on, you know?
1:22:00
Even though she said after she left, she said, you know, we never, by the
1:22:07
way we haven’t had sex in over a year.
1:22:11
So, a few days later she came to me and said, I want a divorce
1:22:17
so I can get on with my life.
1:22:18
I said, I just don’t believe that’s God’s will.
1:22:18
I don’t believe that’s God’s will.
1:22:18
Come back a couple months later, I need a divorce.
1:22:18
I got somebody loves me.
1:22:18
I love them.
1:22:18
We want to get married and get on.
1:22:19
I said, I just don’t believe that’s God’s will.
1:22:21
When
1:22:36
she started showing, she came back and said, I’m pregnant.
1:22:42
We want to get married.
1:22:44
I need a divorce.
1:22:44
I said, well, you can have one.
1:22:50
So, when the kids would come over, they would sometimes come over to visit me and
1:22:56
they wouldn’t bring their little brother.
1:22:58
So, who were your two?
1:22:59
Huh?
1:22:59
Three.
1:23:00
Three, two, three that you have
1:23:03
with your wife.
1:23:04
With her, yeah.
1:23:05
So, I have four children altogether.
1:23:08
Who’s the fourth?
1:23:10
He is.
1:23:12
The one that your wife gave birth to...
1:23:14
Right.
1:23:16
...that wasn’t your own child?
1:23:17
Right.
1:23:18
Yeah.
1:23:19
So I told the kids, I said, you know, that’s your brother.
1:23:22
He needs to come, too.
1:23:25
He would come over.
1:23:27
We’d all, every time the family got together, we all did things
1:23:30
together, because it is not his fault.
1:23:32
I
1:23:38
have such a beautiful relationship with all my children, including him.
1:23:43
He was going to Concordia College.
1:23:44
He said, Daddy Richard, he said, the kids keep asking me who my daddy is.
1:23:51
Can I tell them you are?
1:23:53
I said, yes.
1:23:54
I’d be honored.
1:23:56
Now, when I go around, even today when he introduces me to people,
1:24:00
he says this is my father, Richard.
1:24:04
Did your wife marry the man that...?
1:24:07
Huh-uh [shakes head side to side]
1:24:07
. So, he didn’t really have another male figure in his life.
1:24:11
Hmm-mm, no, no, no.
1:24:16
Then, at that time, so
1:24:21
for 13 years did you live in that same apartment?
1:24:23
Or move?
1:24:24
For 13 years we moved around all over the place.
1:24:29
We were living in a duplex.
1:24:32
We
1:24:34
lived in a place that her father owned.
1:24:39
We were renting from him.
1:24:40
We always had trouble financially and ended up having to move somewhere else.
1:24:46
We lived in several different places, but all—the farthest we ever lived
1:24:52
was out on Southeast Woodstock.
1:24:56
Mm-hmm.
1:24:57
That was a little ways away, but it was nice little ranch-style home.
1:25:03
For the 13 year period, we never lived by ourselves.
1:25:07
We always had somebody living with us.
1:25:10
It was either her friend that needed a place to stay, stay for 2, 3 years.
1:25:16
Some other young lady, some guy going to college.
1:25:19
We always helped somebody who was living with us.
1:25:25
It was a ministry.
1:25:26
We even had a guy who was Church of God pastor who lived in Klamath Falls.
1:25:31
His daughter was coming over to go to school and he wanted his daughter to
1:25:34
be safe, wanted to know if we could take her in while she was in school.
1:25:38
She came, and she lived with us.
1:25:40
We just had a history of people living with us.
1:25:42
I had a friend of mine that I let him live with us.
1:25:45
I remember being embarrassed because I was complaining, because I said, well, he
1:25:49
said he was only going to be here for a couple of months while he finds a place.
1:25:52
It’s been over 6 months and, you know.
1:25:56
I said, he’s eating up all the food.
1:25:59
Blah, blah, blah.
1:26:00
Then we heard something moved on the out porch.
1:26:04
I said, oh, man, he’s here.
1:26:10
He came out with his coat leaving, said, man I’ll be out of here
1:26:13
in a week, and he was gone.
1:26:18
I didn’t mean it that way, you know.
1:26:20
But, you know, I think at a certain point you say, why does
1:26:25
everybody want to live with us?
1:26:26
We’ve helped a lot of people.
1:26:26
What
1:26:32
were the different jobs
1:26:36
that you had?
1:26:38
I worked with a lot of service industries, like Sky Chef at the airport in the
1:26:48
flight kitchen preparing meals for the airlines, going on the airlines
1:26:55
stripping them out and coming back in.
1:26:58
I loved that job because I could take home unopened bottles of
1:27:03
champagne and boxes of peanuts.
1:27:06
That stuff is already paid for.
1:27:07
They can’t resell it again.
1:27:09
It’s either in the garbage can or employees take it home.
1:27:13
It was
1:27:16
fun.
1:27:17
Sometimes untouched first-class steak dinners, you know?
1:27:24
I opened it up, [makes biting gesture] take steak, put it in the
1:27:27
garbage disposal [laughs] . That
1:27:33
was a fun job.
1:27:34
I enjoyed that until I met my brother at the highway
1:27:37
division that offered me a job.
1:27:39
Then I went to work for them.
1:27:41
I worked for
1:27:46
Oroweat Foods out in Beaverton.
1:27:49
I really loved that job.
1:27:51
I got that job before me and my wife got divorced.
1:27:56
She went on a vacation with my two oldest kids with her family, and I kept
1:28:02
our newborn baby girl with me and I had an interview and I took her with me.
1:28:09
I think she’s the reason why I got the job, because they were impressed.
1:28:13
That
1:28:16
was a good job, too.
1:28:17
I really loved that.
1:28:18
I never bought bread as long as I worked with them, because I’d take home
1:28:23
bread for me and the rest of my family.
1:28:27
It was simple.
1:28:27
It was really neat.
1:28:29
Oroweat foods is good food.
1:28:31
They own Entenmann’s.
1:28:32
I don’t know if you’ve heard of that.
1:28:35
The pastries, the donuts and stuff like that, Entenmann’s out of Seattle.
1:28:39
They’re owned by Kraft General Foods, too.
1:28:42
Anyway, I enjoyed working with that.
1:28:44
But then I said, I really want to work with something ministry-related.
1:28:50
I want to get a job where I’m getting paid to do stuff that’s part of my collar.
1:28:56
So, Albina Ministerial Alliance had a community services program.
1:29:01
They were looking for a case manager with their housing,
1:29:08
transitional housing program.
1:29:11
I was one of the first case managers with that program.
1:29:14
That kind of rolled over into the community services, because Urban League
1:29:18
was getting rid of their community services program and they wanted to roll
1:29:21
it over into Albina Community Services, so a couple of Urban League staff
1:29:24
came over and started working with us.
1:29:26
Then we went to the little church on Dekum and 15th where AME had their offices.
1:29:32
We started working in there and started working with all kinds of programs.
1:29:37
I became the person that was handling the rent assistance.
1:29:40
Anybody that needed rent assistance, had to come to me to get rent assistance.
1:29:43
I also became, before I quit, I became a housing specialist.
1:29:52
It was
1:29:56
a pilot-type job, where we create the job.
1:30:02
I was doing new innovative things, and I was creating these housing
1:30:05
stabilization classes for families and people and working with transition
1:30:11
people that was going in hotels or in transitional housing and stuff like that.
1:30:16
It’s just really neat working with people trying to help them change
1:30:20
their lives and get established.
1:30:22
I think I left there because I got married again and moved to Wisconsin.
1:30:31
Then I got involved there.
1:30:32
I was with, Racine Weed and Seed as a community organizer.
1:30:37
I became a police officer at a juvenile detention center.
1:30:42
I didn’t like that because I ended up tearing my rotator cuff
1:30:45
completely trying to throw an unwilling juvenile in his cell.
1:30:49
That’s a—I’m not a jail officer, not me.
1:30:58
What was that like in Wisconsin?
1:30:59
Tell us a little bit more how that—?
1:31:02
How’d I get married to her?
1:31:04
Yeah.
1:31:05
The connection?
1:31:06
Why you did move to Wisconsin.
1:31:08
Well, my extra-curricular activity brought me to Wisconsin, because there
1:31:15
was a lady in about 1990 or something like that, she was part of the Sabin
1:31:20
Neighborhood Association, and she wanted to go house to house and find out who
1:31:25
was interested in affordable housing.
1:31:27
Well, I said, yeah I’m interested in affordable housing.
1:31:29
So, I started working with her, because Sabin Neighborhood Association wanted to,
1:31:38
they wanted to get involved in building affordable housing, but they can’t
1:31:43
do it as a neighborhood association.
1:31:45
They have to create a community development corporation
1:31:47
in order to do that.
1:31:49
They started one from the ground up.
1:31:52
I ended up serving on that committee.
1:31:57
I became their first board chairman.
1:32:00
I served there until I moved as a chairman of the board.
1:32:06
We got housing.
1:32:06
We went through training and
1:32:10
everything like this.
1:32:11
We bought—the training that I went through is now being offered as a 2-year
1:32:15
degree program at Portland Community College, but I did it in 6 months.
1:32:22
We acquired property.
1:32:23
We did a couple of programs.
1:32:25
We had this place called the House of Eugene?
1:32:30
Something like that.
1:32:31
Anyway, it was a transitional house for African American women
1:32:35
coming out of prison to get acclimated back into society.
1:32:38
They go to the transition housing and get case management and everything like this.
1:32:43
Then we started building another affordable housing in the city, and they
1:32:47
now got their own building on 15th and Alberta with apartments on top of it.
1:32:55
They’ve done lots of things, apartment complexes and things around the city.
1:33:01
Plus, I worked with Housing Our Families, which is another
1:33:04
community development organization.
1:33:08
I started getting involved in community development type stuff, grassroots
1:33:12
type stuff, and that’s the reason why I was working with Racine Weed and Seed.
1:33:18
I said, I kind of like this stuff.
1:33:20
I was involved with Racine Interfaith Coalition.
1:33:26
They don’t have nothing like that on the west coast, but in the
1:33:30
Midwest these churches came together and did some fantastic things.
1:33:36
They were made up of Baptist, Church of God, Pentecostal, Catholic, you know.
1:33:43
I think we had every kind of denominations, including
1:33:45
Unitarian, except for Jewish.
1:33:47
We hadn’t got them to be a part of us yet when I was there, but was able to get
1:33:56
teachers—we rallied together to get teachers a raise, and we got teachers
1:34:01
raises through our grassroots organizing.
1:34:06
We did a lot of things.
1:34:07
We’d see some good grassroots community training through them.
1:34:14
When you were here?
1:34:16
Mm-hmm.
1:34:17
Then there were opportunities for paid work within that whole...?
1:34:23
Yeah, because I had a good pastor.
1:34:26
It’s not what you know because I went there with impeccable credentials.
1:34:33
I did innovative work with the housing as a housing specialist.
1:34:37
I went there, and I saw them, they were hiring somebody for a job with
1:34:43
the county and I qualified for it.
1:34:49
I gave them my resume.
1:34:51
I didn’t get the job.
1:34:53
Next thing I know, they got a job, a new job, announcement.
1:34:59
It was a housing specialist.
1:35:02
They copied my resume for the job description.
1:35:08
What was the difference?
1:35:11
There was no difference.
1:35:16
With the person?
1:35:16
Racine is not a big, huge city.
1:35:19
It’s not a small, tiny city, but it’s small enough so it’s not
1:35:25
who you know, I mean it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.
1:35:28
So, I applied for this other job, Racine Family something, anyway, the guy who was
1:35:37
the director, he’s a friend of my pastor.
1:35:42
He comes to our services sometimes, and there was this other lady who
1:35:46
was applying for the same position.
1:35:48
She got the job.
1:35:49
I didn’t.
1:35:52
The guy who’s a friend of my pastor said that the reason why she got the
1:35:56
job and you didn’t get it, because everybody knows her and nobody knows you.
1:36:04
They’re not hiring prop—and then, less than a month, the job was opening again.
1:36:10
Why?
1:36:10
Because she went to the highest bidder.
1:36:13
She wasn’t even committed to stay with them.
1:36:17
She took the job from me and then she didn’t want it.
1:36:20
You know?
1:36:21
They asked me if I wanted it.
1:36:22
I said, no.
1:36:23
You guys had your chance the first time around.
1:36:28
You don’t get me just because the first thing didn’t work out for you.
1:36:32
You could have chosen me anyway, because I don’t play that.
1:36:38
I just started working with my church.
1:36:40
We had a childcare center.
1:36:42
I drove the bus to pick up kids, to bring them to the center, take them
1:36:47
to school when school started, pick them back up and bring them back
1:36:50
until their parents come back up.
1:36:51
I was the cook.
1:36:52
I fixed nutritional meals for all the kids and everything.
1:36:56
Did you get paid for that?
1:36:57
Yeah.
1:36:57
Yeah.
1:36:58
Yeah.
1:36:58
I got paid.
1:36:59
My pastor made sure I had a job.
1:37:01
Now, this is in Wisconsin?
1:37:03
Wisconsin.
1:37:06
With your second wife that you met in Portland?
1:37:10
I met her in Chicago.
1:37:12
I didn’t get into how we met.
1:37:14
Okay.
1:37:17
There’s an organization in the Church of God called L.I.V.E Ministries:
1:37:22
Laypeople In Vital Exchange.
1:37:27
It’s been mostly just a White group.
1:37:31
They didn’t have much African Americans in their group.
1:37:34
They didn’t do much outreach to African American churches,
1:37:37
and they wanted to do that.
1:37:39
One of the first churches was a church in Chicago.
1:37:43
When I went to that, I was working with Sabin Community Development Corporation.
1:37:45
I was on
1:37:50
the board.
1:37:51
There was a Dr. John Perkins, who’s the founder and director of the National
1:37:59
Association of Christian Community Development Corporations, sponsored
1:38:04
a conference, a community development conference that was going on in Chicago.
1:38:11
The U.S. Bank gave Sabin $1,000 to go to that conference.
1:38:18
While I was at that conference, I was killing two birds with one stone.
1:38:22
So, I went to that one and then I was going to go to
1:38:29
the Chicago L.I.V.E. Ministry thing and work on that.
1:38:35
I met her at the first year that we went to a L.I.V.E.
1:38:39
Ministries in Detroit, Michigan.
1:38:42
Then we went to Chicago.
1:38:46
I was trying to find somebody to stay with, because the hotel couldn’t
1:38:51
accommodate me for all 3 or 4 nights that I was going to be there.
1:38:55
There was just going to be
1:38:59
one night only, because the other nights were booked up.
1:39:03
I didn’t have no place to stay.
1:39:07
I was trying to find somebody, and she said, well, you can’t
1:39:09
find nobody just let me know.
1:39:11
I let her know, I said, I can’t find nobody.
1:39:16
She would drive all the way from Racine to Chicago.
1:39:20
She picked me up.
1:39:22
Then she arranged it where I’m not going to drive you all
1:39:24
the way to Chicago this time.
1:39:26
I’m going to take you to Kenosha.
1:39:29
Hop on the train and then you go to Chicago.
1:39:31
Well,
1:39:35
the way we met.
1:39:37
I kind of look at it this way.
1:39:40
She’s a pastor’s kid, too.
1:39:43
Her father used to pastor a church in Saginaw, Michigan.
1:39:47
He was one of the associate ministers at the church that
1:39:52
I was at after we got married.
1:39:56
She’s a pastor’s kid, a preacher’s kid.
1:39:57
I’m a preacher’s kid.
1:39:57
Two preacher’s
1:40:00
kids, the way we got together, that’s not the way you’re supposed to get
1:40:03
together, because you’re preacher’s kids.
1:40:05
You should have known better.
1:40:09
You know, you go out of town.
1:40:11
Don’t go stay with a woman,
1:40:17
and then the next thing I know
1:40:20
I’m getting asked a question, does this mean that we’re dating now?
1:40:29
[Laughs] . Okay, what did I get myself into here?
1:40:35
Then, we started corresponding back and forth, and she wants to get married.
1:40:42
I’m not really ready to get married.
1:40:46
She gets mad.
1:40:47
She hangs up.
1:40:50
If you don’t want to get married, I don’t see why we’re even dating.
1:40:56
Calls back later.
1:40:57
She apologized.
1:40:58
She
1:41:01
shouldn’t have said that.
1:41:02
About how old were you at that time?
1:41:06
I was in my early 40s.
1:41:11
She was similar aged?
1:41:13
Yeah.
1:41:14
Very nice lady, too.
1:41:19
I just didn’t feel like that I loved her enough to be married to her.
1:41:22
My son, my oldest son, was involved in gangs, The Bloods.
1:41:28
I
1:41:31
had already been going to
1:41:35
court and me and his mom is always there for him, and I just,
1:41:45
he ended up, I said, well, then when the pressure come on about
1:41:50
getting married and me moving there.
1:41:52
I’m just thinking, I said, well, maybe this is a good opportunity for me to
1:41:56
get my son out of here, get him in a new environment, boom, boom, boom.
1:42:03
Maybe the idea of getting married to Doris is not a bad idea.
1:42:08
But, I’m sitting there at the altar thinking I’m making a big mistake here.
1:42:16
But I go ahead and I get married.
1:42:19
Then we go on the honeymoon, and now I want to say I think we made a big mistake.
1:42:25
Of course, I sleep on the couch.
1:42:29
But we walked along the beach talking about it.
1:42:34
Bottom line was, well, maybe you’ll grow to love me, because
1:42:40
my take was, I don’t think I love you enough to be married to you.
1:42:48
So, we tried it out.
1:42:50
I talked to my pastor, and I told my pastor, my pastor said if I promise
1:42:54
to help you and work with you, would you promise to stick with it?
1:43:00
I said, okay.
1:43:01
So, after a year or two I told my pastor, I said, it’s not going to work.
1:43:08
It’s not going to work.
1:43:12
We’re the only couple I know of where I’m leaving, my kids came to stay
1:43:17
with me for the summer, but we’re all going back to Portland together.
1:43:25
Before that happened, here’s my son.
1:43:28
I’m thinking I’m getting him out of the gangs.
1:43:32
I didn’t know I was taking him in a worse environment.
1:43:36
Now, he’s hooked up with the Gangster Disciples.
1:43:41
He’s selling drugs—matter of fact,
1:43:46
after my son ended up back in Portland, when we moved back
1:43:48
to Portland, there’s a guy that came—my ex-wife gave me some money.
1:43:57
He said, this is for your son.
1:44:00
No, the guy, before I left, the guy gave me some money,
1:44:05
said, give this to your son.
1:44:07
He sold me some weed, and I didn’t have all the money.
1:44:11
I said, he sold you some weed?
1:44:12
I didn’t say that, but, you know I’m saying.
1:44:16
Man, I said, I thought I’m taking him away, and I’m really making a
1:44:20
big mistake because I’m making a big booboo, because I married this
1:44:23
woman that I really don’t love enough to respect her to be her husband.
1:44:31
I don’t think I was supposed to be married.
1:44:34
Even today, when we talk, she admits that she pressured me into getting
1:44:43
married.
1:44:44
You know, some people say, well, nobody can make you do something.
1:44:48
But, with all the factors that was in play,
1:44:53
figured I need to get my son out of there.
1:44:56
Come back to Portland.
1:44:57
He’s still getting in trouble.
1:45:01
I come back home.
1:45:02
I stay with my niece for a few months.
1:45:07
Anyway, before I get to that,
1:45:10
I’m leaving because I’m not going to be with her more.
1:45:13
She knows that I’m going to be getting a divorce.
1:45:18
We the only ones that know that: church don’t know that, family don’t know that.
1:45:23
But, we had this big old party, going away party.
1:45:27
We had so much food.
1:45:28
I mean, goo-gobs of food.
1:45:30
We had hot links and chicken, friend chicken, and barbeque
1:45:36
ribs and potato salad, greens, and cornbread and everything.
1:45:41
All kinds of food.
1:45:43
We made homemade ice cream and packed them into dozens of
1:45:47
quart containers and everything.
1:45:50
We had so much food that was good.
1:45:53
We invited the choir members, church members, and family over.
1:45:57
Next two Sundays, we was sharing leftovers with large groups of people.
1:46:04
Everybody thought I was going back there to get a job.
1:46:08
Nobody knew that I’m not coming back.
1:46:13
Her dad said, you and Richard are
1:46:18
not together anymore, are you?
1:46:22
When I met her dad, she wanted me to ask her dad for her hand in marriage.
1:46:28
Her dad thought that we should just be friends.
1:46:32
But we didn’t do that.
1:46:35
Nobody listened to the dad anymore.
1:46:39
First wife, dad said, no, wait until you graduate from college.
1:46:42
Second dad said, just be friends.
1:46:46
Didn’t
1:46:49
do that.
1:46:50
He was hurt, because now this was his baby girl.
1:46:54
All his other daughters got married and divorced.
1:46:57
He didn’t want that to happen to her, and it has.
1:47:00
Both
1:47:04
her parents are deceased now.
1:47:06
Right after her father passed away.
1:47:08
Her mother passed away shortly after that.
1:47:13
I’m back here in Portland now, you know?
1:47:16
I’m not married to her.
1:47:18
I’m in Portland still dealing with my son.
1:47:20
Here I’m at my niece’s house staying and it’s pouring down
1:47:27
raining.
1:47:27
I chuckled because my sister Linda, she smokes weed.
1:47:34
She was telling me, said, oh, I just seen your son.
1:47:36
He just sold me some
1:47:40
weed [laughs] . So, here I am at my niece’s house.
1:47:45
It’s pouring down raining.
1:47:46
There’s a knock at the door.
1:47:47
Open it up.
1:47:49
There’s my son in this see-through rain coat, blood everywhere:
1:47:54
face, body and everything.
1:47:57
I said, what’s?
1:47:58
He said, Dad, I need $100.
1:48:01
I said, $100 for what?
1:48:04
I short-changed a drug dealer.
1:48:07
He said, $100 or your life.
1:48:12
I didn’t have but $100 in my savings account.
1:48:16
So, I said, come on, let’s go.
1:48:17
No, Dad, don’t get involved.
1:48:21
I just need $100.
1:48:23
So, I go to the bank, I draw out my last little $100.
1:48:26
I give it to him.
1:48:27
I said, I want you to know that this night your life is only worth $100.
1:48:36
He goes back.
1:48:39
But my son is amazingly
1:48:46
a positive individual.
1:48:47
He’s doing great things.
1:48:49
He’s got 3 sons now and a great wife.
1:48:54
They live in a nice home in Vancouver, Washington.
1:48:58
He’s been doing his music career and
1:49:04
done some great CDs.
1:49:05
I don’t know why.
1:49:06
You got to pay people to rotate your CDs.
1:49:10
You have to pay people
1:49:13
to acknowledge good talent.
1:49:16
That’s kind of dumb.
1:49:18
He’s got all this great music talent and everything and all these great
1:49:22
CDs, and nobody doesn’t hear them.
1:49:27
But he’s good.
1:49:29
He’s good.
1:49:31
He’s a good father.
1:49:34
Now, he’s getting a job at POIC and Rosemary High School to work with
1:49:45
kids involved with the gangs.
1:49:47
That’s great.
1:49:50
So, tell us a little more about the different jobs you had.
1:49:55
Then, after that, I want to find out a little bit more about where
1:49:59
we are sitting and where you’ve been living and why and bring us up.
1:50:09
Okay.
1:50:18
Gosh, I think the first, you’ve heard about the jobs at Racine with the juvenile
1:50:25
detention facility and the Racine Weed and Seed as a community organizer.
1:50:31
One of the things I liked about that job was that you get to get out and
1:50:37
meet people in the community and talk to them about what they need
1:50:40
to see and everything like this.
1:50:42
They even had all the churches were like houses of faith, so that when, if
1:50:50
a police stopped somebody they may have an ounce of weed or something like that,
1:50:56
they don’t go to jail and get a record.
1:50:59
You take them to one of the houses of faith.
1:51:03
They have a commitment wot work with that person, help turn them around.
1:51:08
It avoided these people getting caught up in the system.
1:51:12
I liked that and then getting involved with the neighborhood association.
1:51:15
I never been involved with them before, but I got involved
1:51:18
with them through Racine.
1:51:20
Then I had a problem with my employer, because somehow she
1:51:24
didn’t think I was doing the work.
1:51:27
She thought I was just wasting time out there.
1:51:30
I’m not doing the work.
1:51:32
I don’t see the work you’re doing.
1:51:35
Then, we clashed heads and everything, and she says, well, maybe you
1:51:41
should get your things and leave.
1:51:43
I said, well, I don’t have to leave.
1:51:44
I’m quitting, because I don’t have to take this disrespect, you know,
1:51:49
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1:51:50
Then I think
1:51:54
the chairman of the board of directors wanted to talk to me on the phone.
1:51:57
I said, I ain’t talking to nobody.
1:51:58
I’m out of here.
1:52:01
Nobody’s going to change my mind.
1:52:02
Then
1:52:06
I went back in the community.
1:52:08
There was an African American woman that was doing my job.
1:52:10
She was going door to door.
1:52:12
I said, hello.
1:52:12
You’re the person that’s taken over my job.
1:52:14
She said, yes.
1:52:14
I said, well, are you having any success?
1:52:18
She said, not really, because everybody say you’ve already been there
1:52:25
[smiles] . He’s already been here and talked to us about this.
1:52:27
And my boss don’t think I’m out there doing
1:52:33
nothing.
1:52:33
I said, I don’t beg for work.
1:52:37
I don’t let nobody disrespect me, either, because I know my skills and
1:52:44
everything like that.
1:52:44
I’m playing no games with nobody, you know.
1:52:47
I always believe that when I’m looking for work,
1:52:51
it’s all about whether I want to work for you or not, not I need a job.
1:52:57
I don’t work for nobody just because I need a job, because I may not like
1:53:03
you and your morals might not be great, so why would I want to work for you?
1:53:10
I worked in employment,
1:53:13
right down the street there.
1:53:16
That’ll bring you to this place.
1:53:20
I started working for the Urban League in 1998, because this was right
1:53:28
after I came back from Wisconsin.
1:53:31
I got divorced in ’98.
1:53:33
Then this one lady that got pregnant, she recommended that they hire me to
1:53:41
take her place until she had her baby.
1:53:44
I was a community organizer for Housing Our Families, which was a
1:53:47
community development corporation.
1:53:50
After the lady came back to get her job back, I ended up getting a
1:53:57
job working for Albina Ministerial Alliance again, you know?
1:54:04
But it wasn’t the same.
1:54:05
It wasn’t the same.
1:54:06
I ended up getting a job working for Urban League as an employment specialist.
1:54:14
I worked for the northeast one stop career center.
1:54:19
That was during the days when Lawrence Dark was the
1:54:25
president of the Urban League.
1:54:28
That was also during the days when the Urban League was not kosher
1:54:33
what their financial dealings.
1:54:35
Multnomah County was pulling money out and they had fired an orange
1:54:42
dart and everybody else was getting their pink slips from the one stop.
1:54:50
I got my letter from Urban League saying, sorry, we have to let you go.
1:54:57
Work Systems Inc., who funds all the workforce development activity in the
1:55:03
state of Oregon, took over the one stop.
1:55:09
I think out of the Urban League people I was the only one that was rehired
1:55:15
by Work Systems Inc. Then, the lady that’s the reason why I went into
1:55:22
this place, she became our manager.
1:55:25
Then I worked with several other new people.
1:55:30
I was getting paid.
1:55:31
I was hired to get paid $24,000 a year from Urban League, but they were
1:55:37
actually paying me $26,000 a year.
1:55:40
They were doing stuff like that.
1:55:45
When Work Systems Inc. hired me, they started paying me
1:55:49
$30,000 a year, which is more.
1:55:54
And the benefits, whoo.
1:55:57
Boy, I got spelled with them benefits.
1:55:59
They had super benefits.
1:56:00
They even bought you an annual bus pass every year.
1:56:07
Then, in 6 months, they raised it to $35,000.
1:56:12
I said, I was getting paid $26,000, now I’m getting paid $35,000.
1:56:17
But they can’t micromanage, so after 2 years they had to open it up for RFP, for
1:56:23
fiscal management, and Portland Community College got the grant, got the contract.
1:56:29
One
1:56:32
of the ladies that I worked with, she went over—first, Maggie
1:56:36
wanted to start her own business.
1:56:38
So, she brought Mulou and everybody else over here, but we weren’t
1:56:43
going to make no money at first, because we just started business.
1:56:48
Mu said, no, I have to have some money.
1:56:50
So, Mulou went over here and took a job at the one stop at
1:56:53
the workforce training center at
1:56:58
PCC.
1:56:59
Then one of the ladies said that, that was working here, she said her husband
1:57:03
won’t allow her to work for nothing.
1:57:06
She left out of here.
1:57:07
Then there was only 3
1:57:10
of us left with Maggie.
1:57:15
Then, two: me and Alexis.
1:57:19
We work with Maggie, and it was touch and go for a minute.
1:57:24
Maggie
1:57:26
had to kind of let the business go, but the reason why I first came here—I
1:57:32
was living at the Yards at Union Station right down by Naito Parkway.
1:57:38
When I lost my job at the one stop,
1:57:43
I had no income, except for the unemployment.
1:57:47
Well, that wasn’t enough to keep that apartment over there.
1:57:50
I ended up losing that apartment.
1:57:51
I didn’t have nowhere to go.
1:57:54
Maggie let me, she had her office set up in here, an office upstairs,
1:57:59
and her main office up in the loft.
1:58:03
She even rented it out to some people.
1:58:08
Then,
1:58:12
she let me sleep on the floor upstairs, and that’s what I
1:58:18
did for about a couple years.
1:58:20
I slept on the floor.
1:58:22
Then, finally, nobody was using the upstairs anymore, so that
1:58:28
ended up becoming my apartment.
1:58:32
Then, because I was here, our congregation was in transition.
1:58:38
So, we needed a place to worship.
1:58:42
We couldn’t continue to do at the Hampton Inn at the airport no more.
1:58:49
When I told Maggie, I said, we can use—she wanted to get out of this,
1:58:55
up from under this, so when I told her the proposition of our church.
1:58:59
She said, yes!
1:59:02
Yes.
1:59:02
She was standing with her husband, he said, yes, yes, yes.
1:59:06
But what it is is that
1:59:10
Maggie became my landlord, because the place is leased to her.
1:59:15
She was beginning to sublet it: the apartment to me and
1:59:19
sublet this to the church.
1:59:23
Now explain a little more what is the business that Maggie had.
1:59:30
Brister & Associates, business and employment consultants.
1:59:34
What is that?
1:59:35
It’s an employment agency, but we specialize in not only providing
1:59:41
people for employers but also providing training, not only for the employees
1:59:49
but for the employers, because employers need training sometimes.
1:59:55
We were professionals, and we knew our business and we offered those services.
2:00:01
I’m not really a phone call person or anything like that.
2:00:05
I don’t like to do cold calling, but I don’t think I was that good at this.
2:00:11
It’s just not something that I wanted to do.
2:00:15
Explain a little more for just what the business was.
2:00:20
It was a business and employment services.
2:00:24
It was a, so you had a private business?
2:00:30
It’s not a non-profit.
2:00:31
Right, well, we... no, it wasn’t a non-profit.
2:00:33
We actually like a temp agency.
2:00:35
How would you
2:00:39
make the money?
2:00:40
The person who came to answer the job would
2:00:45
have to pay?
2:00:46
The employer would pay us.
2:00:48
The employer?
2:00:49
The employer.
2:00:50
Just like they pay temp agencies for people.
2:00:55
Then it would be our responsibility to write a check and take out
2:01:00
the taxes for the temp workers.
2:01:05
Sometimes, we would do recruitment for employers.
2:01:09
We had a construction company owner that did framing, and so he would
2:01:18
work for us to provide people to work with him to frame houses.
2:01:23
He would pay us to recruit.
2:01:31
Then we did resumes.
2:01:33
People paid us to do their resumes and their bios and portfolios, those
2:01:42
types of thing.
2:01:43
They had job fairs.
2:01:45
For instance, we had a
2:01:51
job fair one time where we invited Nike
2:01:57
to come and
2:02:00
then we would have food and some jazz music in the background, stuff like that.
2:02:05
Then we,
2:02:08
no commitment by the employer, then we had the prospects to dress up and had
2:02:15
their best resume that we put together for them and just come and just mingle.
2:02:19
Have some ours ’devoirs and listen to some nice music and just kind
2:02:23
of mingle with the employers, and people got hired that way.
2:02:30
It cost money to do that.
2:02:36
We weren’t going to be that successful to stay in business, so
2:02:44
Maggie still works in employment.
2:02:48
She works with employment with Goodwill Industries, so she’s
2:02:51
all over the place with people.
2:02:55
This place is also, those three signs that’s on the door, Maggie’s
2:03:01
also the president of the Jefferson Alumni Association.
2:03:06
She graduated in 1980.
2:03:07
I graduated in ’71.
2:03:07
I’m on
2:03:11
the board, an active member.
2:03:13
So, we have our board meetings here as Jefferson Alumni Association and
2:03:18
then Neighborhood Church of God.
2:03:22
When the landlord, when the top landlord,
2:03:31
when they send us mail, it’s always addressed to Maggie and all others.
2:03:39
So, how long did you participate in this business?
2:03:45
Or did it become a business?
2:03:46
For the first three years, first three or four years.
2:03:50
About how much were you able to make as a take-home salary?
2:03:56
Not much.
2:04:04
I think I got into trouble, because I think at one point I thought
2:04:12
she wasn’t taking out the taxes.
2:04:14
I think she was depending on me to pay my own taxes.
2:04:23
I got into trouble [laughs] , because I didn’t do that.
2:04:26
But it got cleared up.
2:04:30
That was three years, from
2:04:35
what year to what year?
2:04:35
So we probably started here
2:04:40
in 2000, 2000 to 2004, maybe.
2:04:47
She’s still actively involved with the employment consulting work, and she’s
2:04:55
the person that the place is leased to.
2:04:59
So, what she’s allowed to do is sublease.
2:05:05
She sublets it to me as a tenant in the residential part and the church as
2:05:10
a commercial, for the commercial part.
2:05:16
Since 2004, what have you done to be earning a living?
2:05:22
I was working with the Oregon Department of Transportation.
2:05:27
I didn’t want to work for them, but they was the only one that hired me.
2:05:31
There was a few other people that I wanted to work for.
2:05:32
They didn’t hire me.
2:05:33
In 2006, I started working for the Department of Motor Vehicles
2:05:39
as a transportation service representative, at DVM on Southeast 87th
2:05:48
and Powell.
2:05:49
I retired from them in 2015.
2:05:52
As a service representative, what did you do?
2:05:55
Everything.
2:05:55
When you go to the DMV, everything you go to the DMV to do, I’d do that.
2:06:02
You get your license renewed, you get your tags renewed, you put a new
2:06:07
title in your name—anything, you know?
2:06:10
You got to register your vehicle.
2:06:12
You got to register your camper or your semi or whatever the case may be.
2:06:16
Whatever you came to the DMV for, we do it.
2:06:17
Every
2:06:21
person does that.
2:06:22
You were behind the counter?
2:06:24
I was behind the counter.
2:06:25
I was out doing drive tests.
2:06:28
I’d go out
2:06:30
do inspections.
2:06:33
It was a very small office.
2:06:34
No.
2:06:34
it was a big office.
2:06:36
A big office?
2:06:37
It’s one of the biggest ones in Portland.
2:06:39
But you still had all the multi jobs?
2:06:42
Yeah.
2:06:42
Everybody does that.
2:06:44
One day I may be on counter 1 or 2, where I service more people, but my
2:06:52
main job is the set people up on the knowledge test on the computers and
2:06:59
check people in when they come back from a drive test and have passed.
2:07:05
Or, one day I may be down there by the camera area.
2:07:09
I’ll be doing my normal job, but my specialty down there is
2:07:14
people getting their license they got to get their picture taken.
2:07:17
I make sure to take people’s check or replace their license, or whatever.
2:07:21
I may be at a counter where, because we used to have a drive through window.
2:07:26
I might have been through that.
2:07:27
Whatever we do, we do it at different days of the week.
2:07:31
I see.
2:07:32
So, everybody is doing everything.
2:07:36
Whatever the DMV does, everybody who works there does it.
2:07:42
I see.
2:07:42
About what was your salary then, about?
2:07:46
Pathetic.
2:07:48
You know?
2:07:48
I made my big bucks at Coca Cola
2:07:56
[laughs] . It was halfway decent a few times.
2:07:58
I’m not good at saving money.
2:08:01
That’s the reason why I’m low-income today.
2:08:05
Retirement and Social Security—it’s a struggle, but I didn’t work long enough.
2:08:13
Because when I was working for them between ’74 and ’80, when I left, I didn’t
2:08:20
think I was ever going to come back again.
2:08:23
So, I took all my
2:08:28
PERS out.
2:08:28
IF I had of left them in here [laughs] , man.
2:08:34
I messed that one up.
2:08:37
I only worked for them for 9 years.
2:08:40
I retired because I was 62.
2:08:44
Actually, I’ve been working since I was 14 years old.
2:08:48
Social Security has that documentation that I’ve been paying
2:08:51
taxes since age 14, every year.
2:08:58
I said, well, I’m not working past 62.
2:09:03
So, at that time I could either,
2:09:11
I was at the tier where I could retire at 62 or retire with 25 years
2:09:18
of service, something like that.
2:09:20
I didn’t have but 9 years, but I had the 62.
2:09:24
After I quit, and I’m retired, that changed.
2:09:29
Because the person that’s coming behind me you can’t retire at
2:09:36
62.
2:09:36
You have to wait until you’re 64 or have 30 or 35 years in.
2:09:39
Now we
2:09:43
get up to now.
2:09:44
Your main activity is as a pastor?
2:09:48
Yeah.
2:09:49
I’ve been retired.
2:09:50
My main activity is being actively involved in the community.
2:09:52
I’m actively involved with the Eliot Neighborhood Association, the
2:09:56
Humboldt Neighborhood Association, the Jefferson High School Alumni
2:09:59
Association, the AARP, the
2:10:06
genealogical form of Oregon’s African American Special Interest Group, and
2:10:13
the church.
2:10:16
I decided, I told my brother, I said, next year I don’t want to be registered
2:10:22
as an associate pastor anymore.
2:10:28
I’ll be 67, and that’s not what I want to do.
2:10:32
I want to concentrate all my effort on my book.
2:10:36
Since I did that book, that book has literally increased in size by a third.
2:10:44
I met a new family.
2:10:46
I’m the only one doing this, so I need to concentrate on that.
2:10:51
That’s the legacy I need to leave behind.
2:10:56
That’s all I want to do, is just stuff I do in the community and
2:11:02
family historian and genealogy stuff.
2:11:08
Though, on Sundays does this turn into a church service?
2:11:12
Yep.
2:11:12
I set it up in
2:11:18
an auditorium format.
2:11:23
All these churches be sitting back over here.
2:11:27
I set it up.
2:11:27
We have game nights on the first Friday of every month.
2:11:31
I may set up tables with the felt cloth for dominoes and other games.
2:11:39
We had,
2:11:42
let other people use it.
2:11:43
We had a salsa band that was getting ready to perform Friday,
2:11:48
so there were three days prior to that that they had rehearsal here.
2:11:52
A couple of times they had it on a Saturday, from about 9:00 to 11:00.
2:12:00
This last week on Wednesday they had it from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
2:12:09
So, they’re paying in rent?
2:12:11
Well, I told—we have a thing here, when we let people use this we don’t tell
2:12:15
them you pay us this much to use it.
2:12:19
You can use it, just give us a donation.
2:12:23
That donation can be anything they want.
2:12:25
If they want to just give us $5, hey that’s cool.
2:12:28
Give
2:12:33
us $55 that’s cool, too.
2:12:34
For $200, he practiced here 3 times.
2:12:39
Nice salsa group.
2:12:40
You like salsa?
2:12:41
I like all kinds of music.
2:12:44
[Laughs] Then
2:12:48
people have meetings and then, like I said, there’s a friend of mine, she
2:12:51
has done a couple of pop-ups here.
2:12:53
She’s African
2:12:57
Essentials.
2:13:00
She’s got a lot of African soaps and stuff like that and different types of things.
2:13:07
She was having a party here.
2:13:09
She had a paint party.
2:13:11
So, you had the thing around here where they had all these ladies that
2:13:15
was in here, and they were all sipping wine and painting the same thing.
2:13:25
It was nice.
2:13:26
This place has been transformed in so many different things.
2:13:33
The original owner still owns it?
2:13:36
Yeah.
2:13:36
The people that own this whole complex.
2:13:38
It’s the whole complex, I see.
2:13:39
Yeah, this whole entire complex is owned by Billy Reeds and his son runs this,
2:13:48
they got property all over the place.
2:13:50
They got the complex that’s over off to the left, across the street,
2:13:54
behind us on Grant Street, other places within the city they own.
2:14:05
They allow Maggie to sublet this, and Maggie uses the place quite often and she
2:14:14
leases it to us for what we use it for.
2:14:15
Now tell us about this apartment that you’re hoping to get.
2:14:15
Well,
2:14:24
based on my income, I thought that I had to apply for federal preference when
2:14:31
they opened it up, meaning that you get
2:14:36
higher up on the waiting list if you have federal preference.
2:14:40
You get federal preference if you can prove that your housing,
2:14:45
you lost your housing because of urban renewal or eminent domain.
2:14:49
You
2:14:54
had to provide documentation.
2:14:56
I had to go through archive stuff.
2:15:00
I’ve got pictures of
2:15:04
my older brother when he was a little boy standing in front of
2:15:08
the house, 1901 North Vancouver.
2:15:11
I got pictures from, I guess a lady named Mary Hansen, who works for
2:15:16
the city auditors, she provided me with any kind of documentation
2:15:20
I need: old pictures, stuff like
2:15:25
that.
2:15:26
Then, I had copies of Oregonian newspapers, not copies of paper, but
2:15:34
microfilm, showing the apartment and I was born at that address to Archie and
2:15:45
Bernice Hunter, and then one that was actually verifying the residence of Archie
2:15:51
and Bernice Hunter and what he did for a living and all that kind of stuff.
2:15:54
I provided all the documentation they needed, then they sent that paperwork
2:16:00
over to Magnolia II Apartments.
2:16:05
They emailed and told me that I was at the top of the list.
2:16:11
Then when the lady called me from Magnolia, I was the first person called
2:16:16
because I was at the top of the list.
2:16:17
I ain’t never been at the top of nobody’s list before.
2:16:20
I’m on the waiting list for
2:16:24
PCRI, Portland Community Reinvestment Initiative, that
2:16:28
do a lot of affordable housing.
2:16:30
I got on their waiting list in 2015 when I retired.
2:16:35
Then in about 2017,
2:16:40
I came up to the top of the list and then they told me that,
2:16:47
well, you’re at the top of the list.
2:16:49
We do have this one studio.
2:16:52
Would you like to take a look at it?
2:16:53
Well, I said, I’ll take a look at it.
2:16:56
I took a look at it, and I didn’t want it.
2:17:01
Because I took a look at it, they put me back
2:17:06
at the bottom of the list.
2:17:06
I just got a letter a few weeks ago saying that I was at the top of the list again.
2:17:11
I had to come in and update my documentation.
2:17:20
On September 3, I applied for federal preference for them to get on the waiting
2:17:24
list, and I rose to the top already.
2:17:27
I’m going to be one of the first ones to move in there when it opens up in January.
2:17:32
I told the people at PCRI, I don’t know what’s wrong with you guys.
2:17:34
I’ve been with you guys for about 3 or 4 years, and you guys
2:17:37
have done nothing for me here.
2:17:42
They’re pretty pathetic.
2:17:43
I tried to apply for a job in one of the apartments they had built, called the
2:17:48
Beatrice Morrow as a resident coordinator.
2:17:52
I got background experience in that.
2:17:56
I didn’t get hired.
2:17:59
I understand that that position hadn’t even been filled yet.
2:18:04
I don’t know why people don’t hire the right people for the right jobs.
2:18:10
I don’t know that.
2:18:11
They could be a lot better off if they did.
2:18:15
But, no,
2:18:18
I’m here waiting for
2:18:21
them to finish building that, and I’m feeling good about being able
2:18:26
to move into a brand new apartment.
2:18:29
I’m getting tired of waiting 10, 15 minutes for my water to get hot
2:18:37
because it has to travel through all these little pipes and everything.
2:18:39
These pipes are
2:18:43
the same way all through every unit all over the place.
2:18:50
The walls are paper thin.
2:18:51
I
2:18:54
feel like I have no privacy, and I feel like I don’t need to be
2:18:57
hearing some of the things I hear
2:19:03
[laughs]
2:19:05
. Another subject—you were pretty young at the time of the Civil Rights
2:19:11
Movement, in the ‘60s and ‘70s.
2:19:15
Did you, were you aware of what was going on?
2:19:17
Did you participate?
2:19:22
You know, it’s kind of weird.
2:19:22
I never participated but I was always aware of what was going on.
2:19:25
I remember the riots that went on in my neighborhood.
2:19:28
I always wondered, why do we burn down our own stuff?
2:19:36
That didn’t make sense to me, but what made sense was that
2:19:39
we were tired and fed up.
2:19:42
You ain’t going to turn around and kill Martin Luther King.
2:19:45
You’re going too far now.
2:19:53
I know my father,
2:19:56
I don’t know if you know the history about the Egyptian theater in
2:20:03
Portland.
2:20:03
Can you tell us about it?
2:20:05
It was racist.
2:20:05
Blacks could only sit in the balcony, only.
2:20:08
They couldn’t sit in the main auditorium.
2:20:10
They couldn’t get one of them little special suites off to the side.
2:20:15
Just in the balcony.
2:20:20
My father, I had a picture, and I let a gentleman see it that
2:20:28
he never did get it back to me.
2:20:29
I kind of lost that picture, but it was a picture of my father standing in front
2:20:34
of the Egyptian Theater with flyers.
2:20:36
He had on a trench coat and a brim hat boycotting the Egyptian Theater.
2:20:45
I’m trying to find that picture again somewhere.
2:20:49
I’ll never let stuff like that out of my hand again.
2:20:52
I trust nobody.
2:20:55
Yep.
2:20:56
I see that all the time.
2:20:57
My father was always actively involved and doing a lot of things
2:21:01
in the community to help folk.
2:21:03
Because of his skills, he and another person who was a mason
2:21:11
worked with someone else that was trying to put together a trade school
2:21:15
where they would teach a trade to people that wanted to learn a trade.
2:21:22
I don’t know how many years that went on, but
2:21:27
they stopped doing that.
2:21:29
My father during the ‘60s and probably the early ‘70s, they owned a restaurant
2:21:43
called Bernice’s Kitchenette.
2:21:46
It was right on Vancouver, I mean Williams Avenue between Ivy and Cook.
2:21:53
Nice restaurant.
2:21:55
My mother can cook.
2:21:58
I always heard her beef stew was so good that one of the guys that’s the pastor of
2:22:04
the True Vine Missionary Baptist Church, pastor Raymond Edwards, a bus driver for
2:22:11
TriMet, and he will double park his bus right in front of our restaurant and then
2:22:19
come in and sit down and have a bowl of beef stew and a cornbread muffin [laughs]
2:22:25
. He never got in trouble for it.
2:22:28
Then we had ice cream parlor, too.
2:22:31
We had a big machine in the back where my father had fun making 5-gallon
2:22:36
containers of ice cream: black walnut, lemon custard, French vanilla,
2:22:42
strawberry, chocolate, all kinds of stuff.
2:22:49
We had a lot of people come by because that was good food.
2:22:53
Talking about food, so you’re a bachelor and you’re living here.
2:22:56
Do you cook your own food?
2:22:59
I
2:23:01
cook my own food.
2:23:03
My ex-girlfriend nicknamed me Mr. Persnickety, because I’m always—my
2:23:12
thing is that I’m a good cook.
2:23:14
If you can’t cook as good or better than me, why am I patronizing your business
2:23:24
[laughs]
2:23:24
? What do you cook?
2:23:25
Well, I’m not that great of a cook, but whatever I cook, I cook good.
2:23:31
I find it lately that it’s not so much about me is that people
2:23:35
have different types of tastebuds.
2:23:38
They might find something that I think is secondhand, they might
2:23:43
find it absolutely delicious.
2:23:45
I don’t know.
2:23:46
Their tastebuds are different than mine.
2:23:48
What kind of food do you like to eat that you cook?
2:23:52
That I cook?
2:23:52
I try to keep to simple things like boneless chicken breast.
2:23:58
I like African stew.
2:24:02
I’ll get my tomato sauce and my spicy seasonings and my
2:24:10
diced tomatoes and onions and bell pepper and carrots and peanut butter
2:24:19
all that kind of good stuff and make me some nice peanut butter
2:24:23
stew and put it over some rice.
2:24:27
Gumbo.
2:24:27
I think I make pretty good gumbo.
2:24:30
There’s so many different varieties of gumbo.
2:24:32
I think I make—I can’t do fried chicken but I can bake most any type of meat,
2:24:39
from beef to pork, or whatever the case it be, season it where it will be
2:24:43
nice and tender and melt in your mouth.
2:24:46
Cornbread, because they make it easy for you.
2:24:49
Mrs. Marie—just add water.
2:24:54
I don’t like Jiffy no more because I don’t feel like buying milk
2:24:57
and eggs just to make cornbread.
2:24:59
My momma used to make everything from scratch.
2:25:02
I make banana pudding.
2:25:04
I think I make the best banana pudding around.
2:25:05
There’s a lot of people think they can make good banana pudding.
2:25:09
I’ll say, who told you that?
2:25:11
How do you make banana pudding?
2:25:13
From scratch.
2:25:17
What’s the recipe?
2:25:19
I don’t do the double boiler, which is probably the way you should do it.
2:25:23
I get me a nice, smooth pan that you can cook, a pot you can put
2:25:29
over the stove and get you a nice
2:25:33
whisk.
2:25:34
I use my flour and my sugar and my vanilla extract, your eggs and your bananas
2:25:45
and your vanilla wafers, of course.
2:25:47
You get all your liquid and stuff together with your eggs and stuff like that,
2:25:51
you sit there and you just kinda slowly stir it as it cooks, as it thickens.
2:26:02
Then, do all your layering and just pour that pudding over there and everything.
2:26:08
It tastes pretty good.
2:26:11
I don’t do none of that pudding and pie filling thing, you know.
2:26:17
Peach cobbler, sweet potato pie—all my daughters outdo me
2:26:22
in the kitchen, but most of the men in my family are good cooks.
2:26:28
What are you going to do for Thanksgiving?
2:26:30
My daughter invited me to come up there.
2:26:32
They say all their families are trying to do something with their own families
2:26:35
on Thanksgiving, but she wanted us to come together on that Wednesday and
2:26:40
have something together since she’s, her and her husband is no longer together.
2:26:45
They’re divorced.
2:26:46
So, she has her kids on Wednesday.
2:26:51
He has the kids on Thanksgiving.
2:26:54
She wants me to come up there for Thanksgiving with them.
2:26:58
But, no, they—my son, he thinks he can cook a little good, a
2:27:06
little bit, but I know what I can do and I know what I can’t do.
2:27:11
I know what tastes good, what doesn’t taste good.
2:27:14
There was a guy at the store around the corner from the church on 20th and going,
2:27:22
they always sell fried chicken wings.
2:27:25
So, I stopped by there to get me some.
2:27:26
They look real good sitting up there in that warmer.
2:27:29
So, I said, get me 3 chicken wings.
2:27:32
This other guy had 3 chicken wings.
2:27:34
When he came out the store he was like [imitates eating
2:27:37
chicken wings] Man, this is good.
2:27:39
I took a bite of my chicken, and I said, it's not even done.
2:27:46
Then I was saying,
2:27:49
he just like think this chicken is the bomb diggity.
2:27:52
I’m thinking, I said, well, who told them they should be in business?
2:27:57
That doesn’t meant that the chicken wasn’t good, that just
2:27:59
mean that my taste is different from a lot of other people [laughs]
2:28:04
. Okay, well, I’ll just ask you another general question to tie up, because we
2:28:11
have a lot of interesting things that we can go on talking forever and forever.
2:28:17
Just, when you look back at your life
2:28:22
what were some of the best parts in it?
2:28:26
What were some of the not so
2:28:30
good parts?
2:28:31
Well, I think some of the best parts of it was the fun that I
2:28:35
had growing up in the community.
2:28:39
Everybody played.
2:28:40
You’d
2:28:42
look in these streets down here, you don’t see any kids playing in the street.
2:28:47
Nobody’s playing kickball or mother may I or red light-green
2:28:53
light, anything like that.
2:28:55
Nobody plays hide and go seek or hide and go get it.
2:29:01
There’s, man, there’s just so much fun.
2:29:05
We used to play parade.
2:29:07
Everybody get a stick or some shovel or something like that and pretend it
2:29:10
was an instrument and we would march down the street as a band playing.
2:29:14
Is that creativity?
2:29:17
You don’t find no kids going to do that today.
2:29:19
They see you walking down the street like that, they’ll
2:29:21
think you done lost your mind.
2:29:26
The thing that really I like best is the fact that I always like it
2:29:33
when my sisters’ friends come over.
2:29:39
They always had some good-looking female friends.
2:29:42
I would just love when they would come over to visit all the time.
2:29:46
I had a crush on a few of them.
2:29:50
Then the fact that while I was young the band, I think if it wasn’t for music,
2:29:56
I think my life would have probably been boring, because we
2:30:02
did everything in music, everything, from field trips to even going,
2:30:07
taking trips, we’d go down to the Shakespearean Festival and
2:30:13
performances, marching in the band.
2:30:16
I marched in the Rose Festival Parade 4 years in a row.
2:30:22
We played the same song: everything’s coming up roses.
2:30:26
You know
2:30:30
[imitates trumpet melody] . I even remember the fingering.
2:30:33
I
2:30:36
remember always being at the basketball games, the pep band playing, football
2:30:42
games, the marching band is playing.
2:30:46
But now, I’m involved with the Alumni Association, I go to the games.
2:30:50
We don’t have a band.
2:30:51
They don’t have no music department at all.
2:30:53
One of the things that I’m
2:30:57
now working on that I didn’t write down was that
2:31:04
Jefferson High School, Wilson High School, and Cleveland High School is
2:31:07
coming up for the next bond measure.
2:31:10
They just finished, they finished Roosevelt.
2:31:13
They finished Franklin.
2:31:14
They just got through a grant.
2:31:16
Madison is being done now.
2:31:19
Now, all these schools, each of the schools have what they call a conceptual
2:31:23
master planning committee, and I was selected to be on that committee.
2:31:28
So, we had our third meeting and we got one more meeting coming up,
2:31:33
and then they’re going to have a general thing for everybody else.
2:31:38
I get to help come up with a conception, because they want all these schools to be
2:31:47
comprehensive, at least 1,700 students.
2:31:55
I get to have input on what that’s going to look like and what Jeff should
2:32:02
look like in the next 50 to 100 years.
2:32:07
Hopefully, as an alumni association, we can help work to make sure that
2:32:12
some of those things are brought back.
2:32:15
I think—I look at other schools, like Central Catholic, and the
2:32:18
other schools they have bands.
2:32:20
They have a good, sound music program.
2:32:23
Just to see their band at the basketball games and they’re coming to our school
2:32:28
and we ain’t got nothing but cheerleaders.
2:32:31
It’s sort of a sad scenario, but I think school spirit has picked up.
2:32:37
I think people feel better about their school when they got a good music program.
2:32:43
Well, is there anything else that you want to add at this point?
2:32:51
No.
2:32:51
I think,
2:32:56
I remember, one of the things I used to get excited about—I don’t
2:33:00
know if ever heard of Mr. Softee?
2:33:04
It was an ice cream truck?
2:33:05
Ice cream, yeah.
2:33:06
Yeah, you’ve heard of them before?
2:33:08
Yeah, and the music was distinct, as different from any other music from
2:33:12
an ice cream truck you’ve ever heard.
2:33:15
When I used to live where Unthink Park is, we could get up on that
2:33:19
banister and we could see the top of the truck over the hill.
2:33:24
We’ll say, oh, Daddy can we have some money?
2:33:27
Mr. Softee’s coming.
2:33:29
That was exciting for us just as little kids.
2:33:32
Then there was a snow cone truck that used to go by.
2:33:35
I remember my older brother, Charles, he wanted to be the big shot.
2:33:40
When everybody was trying to run and jump on the back of
2:33:44
the truck, which was dangerous.
2:33:46
So, he was knocking everybody else off and he was jumping on them.
2:33:51
So, everybody went on in the house.
2:33:53
Charles came back crying and holding his head because he had fell off
2:34:00
the back of the truck and kind of gashed his head a little bit.
2:34:06
We were saying that’s what you get
2:34:09
[laughs] . There was a lot of fun things.
2:34:12
There was a lot of tragic things that happened, like I
2:34:17
remember my younger brother that
2:34:22
we had a glass, a mirror that was kind of cracked on the edge
2:34:27
and it had a sharp edge to it.
2:34:30
I think we kind of got into it and I remember pushing him back and he fell back
2:34:35
and gashed his head on that thing there.
2:34:39
I felt really bad about that.
2:34:41
So, what would you say was
2:34:45
the best thing in your adult life?
2:34:47
The best thing in my adult life?
2:34:53
Wow.
2:34:53
Retirement?
2:34:54
[Smiles and laughs] You just said senior life, you should say adult life.
2:35:05
I don’t know.
2:35:07
I think the best thing has been
2:35:12
community
2:35:15
involvement.
2:35:15
They had nothing like being involved with the community and helping people
2:35:19
to work together to accomplish goals.
2:35:21
I
2:35:23
live for that.
2:35:27
That’s the reason why I’m actively involved with it now.
2:35:31
I’m not working and I got time to give, and I give back generously.
2:35:39
Okay, well thank you very much.
2:35:40
Mm-hmm, yeah.
