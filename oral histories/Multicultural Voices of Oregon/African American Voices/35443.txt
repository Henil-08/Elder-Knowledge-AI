00:01
Could you tell us your name, the year you were born, and your age please?
00:09
My name is Aletha Christine Emanuel Chavis.
00:19
Now, you’re saying what else am I being asked?
00:21
Could you spell your name?
00:23
Okay, I can spell my name.
00:24
It’s Aletha: A-l-e-t-h-a.
00:30
Last name, maiden name was Emanuel: E-m-a-n-u-e-l, just like
00:37
the hospital here in Portland.
00:40
My last name now is Chavis: C-h-a-v-i-s.
00:46
Date of birth?
00:47
Date of birth was June 29,
00:52
2931.
00:52
Which makes you how old now?
00:54
I think that’s 88.
00:55
A big number [laughs]
01:02
. Where were you born?
01:04
I was born right here in Portland, Oregon.
01:09
What is today’s date?
01:11
Oh dear.
01:12
Today’s date is May 22,
01:17
2019.
01:18
Thank
01:21
you.
01:23
Okay, so, today,
01:27
you could start out with a very beginning of your life again, just
01:33
about where you were born and your childhood up to, I guess, a little
01:41
bit through elementary school.
01:44
Okay.
01:46
Well, as I say, I was born in the Emanuel Hospital, and I always like
01:51
to tell people that my last name, my dad’s name, was Norman Emanuel, and
01:58
it was spelled just like the hospital.
02:00
I don’t know about any significance, except I just like to tell people that.
02:07
That was in the Depression years, 1931.
02:13
I have a brother who was one year older.
02:15
Just a year and a month and a day older and also born at the Emanuel Hospital.
02:20
We grew up in an area of Portland, it really was near Kenton District.
02:29
So, we always, but my mother always said we lived in St. Johns.
02:32
Well, we weren’t really in St. Johns.
02:35
St. Johns was kind of a separate, little bit father west than where we were.
02:40
Anyway, we lived in a little house, a little shotgun house in Kenton area.
02:51
Then when I was 8, my brother 9, we moved to southeast Portland, way
03:00
away from where we were in Kenton.
03:02
The area was Lents neighborhood.
03:09
Interesting thing about living in the Kenton area, we were very young.
03:14
Started grade school at Peninsula School.
03:21
If I remember correctly Peninsula School burned down the year I was
03:25
starting to go to second grade, I think.
03:29
So, my brother and I had to be, they couldn’t use the school so all the
03:34
students from Peninsula had to be bussed.
03:36
We were going to be the first bussed students, which became a
03:41
big issue in Portland during the,
03:45
in 19—the
03:48
‘80s.
03:48
Anyway, we had a choice of being bussed to Woodlawn School, or we could walk
03:57
quite a distance to Peninsula School.
03:59
My mother said, no, you’ll take the bus and you’ll go to Woodlawn School.
04:03
We went to Woodlawn School one day and my brother missed the bus the
04:07
first day coming home, so we didn’t go back to Woodlawn School anymore.
04:11
That meant we walked quite a distance to Portsmouth School for about a year
04:17
before we moved out to Lents neighborhood.
04:21
Growing
04:24
up in Lents was kind of the same sort of neighborhood, just kind of
04:32
low income and everybody was poor.
04:37
I guess we were quite poor, but like all my friends in Lents, we always
04:42
said we were poor but we didn’t have any idea that we were poor.
04:45
We didn’t know, I mean we had enough food to eat and people had their own chickens
04:50
and they had their own cows and what not.
04:55
Everybody had a garden, and you grow your vegetables and get your
05:01
eggs from your chickens and two neighbors had cows a block away.
05:07
We had one neighbor we’d get the milk non-pasteurized from one family
05:13
one week and the next week we’d have to go to the neighbor across
05:16
the street and get their milk.
05:18
You had everything you thought you needed: clothing, my mother would sew.
05:25
All my dresses were made by either my mother or my grandmother.
05:29
My paternal grandmother was a seamstress.
05:32
So,
05:35
we just kind of went along with everything.
05:39
Started third grade at Lents School, which was a block and a half from our house.
05:46
We walked a block and a half every day together, my brother and I. Came home
05:52
for lunch—had to come home every day for lunch, because Mom would have lunch ready.
05:57
You’d eat your lunch and go back to school.
06:01
What would you eat for lunch?
06:05
You almost always had soup of some kind.
06:07
My mom would make a big pot of soup that probably last a week and sandwiches.
06:17
My mom was, well, she was from Barbados.
06:21
She came to the United States when she was 16, actually, but she put
06:26
her age up to 18 because she was in charge of her two younger siblings.
06:32
I think one was 12, her sister was 12, and I think her brother
06:36
was like 8 or something like that.
06:39
She wanted to get away from Barbados because her parents
06:42
were already here in Oregon.
06:45
I don’t know why they were here.
06:47
I found out later that they had worked on the Panama Canal.
06:51
They were recruited from Barbados, and her mom and dad
06:53
had worked on the Panama Canal.
06:56
When the canal was finished they came to Oregon, which seems real strange to
07:01
me, because most people from the islands just came right up the coast to New York
07:06
or Boston or somewhere in that area.
07:09
Anyway, they came to Oregon.
07:11
My mom, when she got to be a little older, she wanted to leave the islands.
07:16
I guess she wanted to be with her mom and dad.
07:19
So, she came and so she was very, shall we say, frugal.
07:27
My mom could stretch anything and unbelievably make the pot
07:33
of soup or whatever, can of tuna fish could go for 3 days.
07:40
I don’t know how she did it, but we always used to say Mom could feed
07:43
the multitude, because she could put on a spread and she loved to cook.
07:50
She could put on this spread of food and it would last.
07:55
Anyway, we always had enough to eat, plenty to eat.
08:01
Tell about your school, then, experience in the school.
08:05
Okay.
08:07
As I say, we moved to Lents area and I was in the third
08:11
grade, starting the third grade.
08:12
My brother was in the fourth grade.
08:17
School was very much like the Peninsula School where we had gone in Portsmouth.
08:24
At that time, the areas where we lived turned out there
08:27
were very few people of color.
08:30
Well, interesting thing, as I think about it,
08:36
I don’t know if my brother and I thought very much about what color
08:41
we were, unless someone found some way to point it out to us.
08:48
Some people did.
08:49
They were very, they’d use the word nigger.
08:53
We were like, what’s that?
08:57
So,
09:00
we were told to go, by our parents, both Mom and Dad, Mom finished high
09:05
school and Dad had had some college work, and their expectation of us in
09:10
school was you’re going to achieve.
09:13
That’s what you’re going to school for.
09:15
Don’t come home with any problems that you’ve had with the teacher,
09:18
because you’re going to be in deep trouble when you get home.
09:23
You pay attention in school.
09:24
You do what you’re told.
09:26
You follow the rules, and everything will be fine.
09:31
We enjoyed school, and we, I just thought learning was just wonderful and
09:39
wanted to participate in everything.
09:41
My brother wanted to participate in everything.
09:43
He was very artistic, had a wonderful voice, and starting singing,
09:52
because my dad was a singer, and the family sang all the time.
09:55
Everybody played the piano and we’d have just sing-alongs at home.
10:02
I mean, we just were having an enjoyable time.
10:08
As I say, expectation of what you do in school is you pay attention
10:13
to the teacher, you bring home good grades, you learn, and
10:21
everybody in the family read.
10:25
We read the Bible a lot and sang and my brother was an artist and
10:33
he would draw things all the time.
10:35
We enjoyed school.
10:36
We came home with all our work that we did in school and got our praises
10:43
from family and followed the law.
10:48
What about your friends?
10:50
Oh, friends.
10:51
We had,
10:54
I think if you’re a good student and you achieve in school and you contribute
11:00
to whatever the school is doing, like if they’re having softball or you
11:06
know football in grade school, and you participate in those things and
11:12
do a good job, you’re usually, people, all the other students value you.
11:22
My brother was really good at baseball.
11:24
I was pretty good at baseball.
11:26
Then we had, what did we play in the gym?
11:29
Because we had a lot of days we were not out on the playground.
11:32
We had to be in the gym.
11:34
But, you played prison ball.
11:38
There were two or three girls that we loved prison ball, and it was, you’d
11:43
have two teams and you’d try to throw the ball to get everybody on the other
11:49
team out, then they’d have to come over to your team, in your prison.
11:55
When you get all them out, of course your team had won.
11:58
How did you get them out?
12:00
You had to hit them with the ball.
12:02
It was a ball like, it wasn’t as large as a basketball.
12:06
It was a, I guess we called it a volleyball, I don’t know.
12:10
It was a little bit smaller than a basketball, but the two
12:14
or three of us girls, we could throw that ball and we loved it.
12:21
We always wanted to play prism ball, and we had gym nearly every day as I remember.
12:29
It wasn’t calisthenics or anything like that.
12:32
It was just game playing and that kind of thing.
12:39
If you contribute to your class, whether it’s in the classroom or in the gym,
12:51
people kind of value you.
12:53
I think both my brother and I were valued in school by most people.
12:58
As I’ve thought about it a little bit,
13:05
it was obvious that there were some kids that had hostilities.
13:10
I don’t know from whence they came, but they were the same
13:14
age as me and my brother.
13:16
We went from third, fourth grade up to eighth grade graduation
13:22
at the neighborhood school and then on into high school.
13:26
You knew that there were certain people in your classes that had attitudes about
13:30
you, but basically they knew better than to antagonize you, except one kid.
13:40
As I think about him, I know his name, but he always wanted to fight with my brother.
13:44
He always wanted to call him nigger.
13:47
My brother would, we’d ask, well, what is that?
13:50
What does that mean?
13:52
What’s that about, because it wasn’t something we used in our house.
13:57
My folks would explain to us, well, there’s some people that have
14:00
attitudes about your skin color.
14:04
They want to antagonize you, pick on you, make fun of you, but
14:08
there’s nothing to make fun of.
14:11
My folks were very religious and they believed God made everybody,
14:15
and He made some one color, some with another color, some with
14:19
straight hair, some with kinky hair.
14:23
If God made it, and everybody believes in God, that ought to be okay.
14:27
Everybody ought to be okay with that.
14:29
Turns out, everybody wasn’t okay with it and they sometimes would show it.
14:34
This one kid would pick on my brother all the time and want to fight.
14:38
My brother was not a fighter.
14:39
He was an artist and an intellect, but he
14:45
would fight if it came to it.
14:48
I remember one time on the way home from school he got in a fight.
14:53
He and I were together and I ran home instead of being there with him
14:57
and told my mom, Milton’s fighting!
14:59
My brother’s fighting!
15:00
She said, well, what are you doing here?
15:02
You go back and help him!
15:04
Okay.
15:04
Okay.
15:05
I don’t remember going back.
15:07
I don’t remember doing anything but probably standing there hollering and
15:10
screaming and maybe trying to kick somebody or something, but basically
15:15
we got along really well with most kid.
15:20
Because of our talent and our contributions, both being able
15:26
to play piano and sing and contribute to events at the school,
15:35
we would be okay.
15:40
That went on through high school.
15:42
My brother was, he sang in the choir.
15:46
He had a beautiful voice.
15:47
He was an artist.
15:51
He sang through four years in the choral group, and I played in the orchestra.
15:58
I played a string bass in high school.
16:02
Don’t know one string from the other now, but that’s what I did in high school.
16:08
I do remember one kid in high school,
16:12
he would always pass by my locker and if he saw me—I knew he was an older kid.
16:16
He was a senior, I think.
16:18
He’d pass by my locker.
16:21
If I was standing out there, he’d call me Buckwheat.
16:24
All I did was giggle, which is what I did most of the time.
16:28
A lot of the times they called me Giggles because I did a lot of that.
16:32
I was like, I wonder why he calls me Buckwheat, I had no clue.
16:36
Well, I had no clue because our family, being Adventist, we didn’t go to movies.
16:42
Everybody else in the school probably knew about Buckwheat and the little
16:49
kids, little gang, or what was it called?
16:53
And so he thought he was insulting me by calling me Buckwheat,
16:56
but he was wasting his breath.
16:58
Because I had no clue.
17:00
Okay, I think now we can jump to the time when you were an
17:07
adult coming back to Portland.
17:13
Okay.
17:15
You know, I was thinking of one incident that kind of, I guess, kind of brought
17:23
to mind some of the problems that I wasn’t aware how some people felt,
17:30
but when you have, I had an experience with my seventh grade teacher.
17:35
The only day I ever remember missing school in the seventh grade was when I
17:41
had to go get glasses, because I guess I wasn’t able to see the board well.
17:46
My mom took me downtown.
17:47
We went to get glasses.
17:49
So, I was out of school the whole day.
17:52
When my mom and I came home that afternoon, when he got to our
17:59
porch, there were about 4 or 5, 6 girls sitting on our porch.
18:03
They were very agitated.
18:06
They wanted to talk to my mom.
18:07
They said, Mrs. Emanuel, we are really upset, because today our teacher told
18:14
us a lot of things and she said, and so, well, what did the teacher say?
18:23
Then, the kids said well, she told us that
18:29
Negroes, I don’t know if she used the word Negroes, she must have said Negroes,
18:35
were dumb.
18:37
They can’t learn.
18:40
They come from monkeys, and you just need to not be associated
18:46
with them because they are no good.
18:48
They’re evil.
18:52
They listed a whole bunch of things, and those girls, 5 or
18:54
6 of them, were very upset.
18:57
They wanted my mom to know that that’s what the teacher had said.
19:01
The thing that I remember about that is how surprised I was that that teacher—my
19:09
seventh grade teacher, whom I thought was a very fine teacher and I never had a hint
19:16
that she had an animosity or disregard or any bad feelings about me as a student,
19:27
because those 7 or 8 girls and I were at the top of our class and we all, all of
19:34
us competed to always get As and have the highest grades in the class and be the
19:40
smartest and probably the smart-aleck-y at the same time, but how surprised I was at
19:48
the fact that that teacher would say those things, because I never noted anything
19:56
where her attitude to me seemed to be negative or ugly.
20:01
But I was really surprised that the girls, that they felt so strongly that
20:09
they would come home and tell my parents.
20:13
Those 5, 6 girls and I went all through high school together.
20:19
After we graduated from high school we still became friends, even
20:22
though some of them moved away.
20:24
They got married long before I did.
20:28
Every summer we would get together at least once or twice for a luncheon or
20:32
something and just go over old times and spend a lot of time giggling and laugh
20:38
about things that went on and things we did, kind of interesting thing.
20:42
What was the response of your parents to hearing about your teacher?
20:48
Well, as I remember, Mom was, she was not a very outspoken person.
20:58
I mean, she didn’t waste words.
21:00
When she spoke, she got right to the point.
21:04
As I remember, she thanked the girls for that information and
21:08
said she would take care of it.
21:11
I really don’t know what she did, except that I know she did go to the
21:14
school and spoke to the principal.
21:19
I did not know immediately what results there were.
21:22
Seems like I remember going through the rest of the school year with
21:26
that same teacher, and I probably sat and looked at her thinking
21:31
I wonder what she was thinking.
21:32
I wonder why she was acting that way.
21:34
I didn’t notice any difference in the way she treated me.
21:39
Truly, I was kind of oblivious to things like that, because it was, we
21:46
were taught not to bother about it.
21:48
It was somebody else’s problem.
21:50
It wasn’t your problem.
21:51
You do what you have to do and you take care of yourself properly and
21:56
don’t worry about other people.
21:59
That’s kind of how I got over that.
22:01
Okay, well, now let’s talk about the time when you were already an adult.
22:08
You come back to Portland.
22:10
Right.
22:12
You’ve divorced by then?
22:15
When I came back to Portland, I was divorced.
22:18
I had spent a number of years following my husband around, who was a Navy person.
22:24
I went to several different cities and—
22:26
So, now tell us about Portland.
22:29
Portland?
22:29
Coming back to Portland?
22:30
Yeah, the time from when you came back, about what you did, how you found a
22:36
place to live, what it was like then?
22:40
Then you had how many children, and being a single mother.
22:45
I came back with 3 young ladies, two of them were in school.
22:50
Let’s seen, Maureen was in first grade I believe and Jenny, the youngest one, was 2
22:59
years behind her, so she wasn’t in school.
23:05
Interesting thing about coming back,
23:10
I kind of kept my eye—every time we would come back to Portland when I
23:13
was traveling, when I was living in different places, we’d always come
23:17
back every summer to visit Mom and Dad in southeast Portland in their place.
23:25
They had a big yard and at the time after I left Portland my mom had started
23:34
adopting, she was a foster parent.
23:37
She and my dad were foster parents and they had adopted, not adopted, but
23:41
they had a number of foster children.
23:47
But we would always come back, and even though she had foster children,
23:50
we’d always squeeze in Mom’s house, which had 4 bedrooms and one bath and
23:56
that kind of thing, but we’d always stay there, me with the three kids.
24:03
When I left after my divorce and came back to stay,
24:09
there was a house next to my mom’s house, which formally had been their property.
24:18
It turned out that they had sold that property, which, when they
24:22
had it was our chicken yard.
24:25
Mom and Dad had this lot next door and they fenced it in and they had chickens.
24:33
The house that was built there had been sold, or, I guess the people moved away.
24:41
So, the house was empty and I bought that house.
24:46
Then we had Mom next door, built a path between the two houses, and the kids would
24:54
spend the night at home and spend, when they came home from school, Grandma’s
24:57
house, with Grandma’s foster kids.
25:03
Just a jolly time.
25:05
Mom didn’t seem to care how many kids around her.
25:08
At one time she had about 5 foster kids, and one of them she adopted as
25:13
an infant, it was an infant child.
25:16
That became my sister.
25:19
She couldn’t cook enough.
25:21
I mean, she loved cooking and so that’s where the kids spent their afternoons.
25:25
Now, you came back and you needed to get a job.
25:30
Tell us about that.
25:31
Right.
25:32
I think the first year I came back, I must have come back;
25:38
yeah I came back in the summer.
25:41
What year?
25:42
Do you remember?
25:44
It would have been,
25:49
let’s see—it would have been
25:54
’70-something.
25:55
I don’t know.
25:58
But, I came back in the summer, and started working, so the kids, you know,
26:07
had time to get organized about going to school and they went to the neighborhood
26:12
school, which was the same school I had gone to, except they had torn down the
26:17
old building, the old wooden building and built a new school, which was just
26:21
across the street from Mom’s house.
26:23
So, they went to Lents School.
26:28
I started working at a library over in north Portland.
26:35
It was near a school,
26:39
about 2 blocks from a school, elementary school named Boise.
26:44
The kids would come from Boise, a lot of times in the afternoon, into the library.
26:49
Some of the time teachers would come.
26:52
Someone said to me, you know we need a teacher at our school, at Boise School.
26:57
I said, oh, fine.
27:01
I did go to the school district and apply for a job.
27:06
They told me they weren’t hiring.
27:07
I
27:11
thought, hmm.
27:11
That’s interesting.
27:14
I know they need teachers somewhere.
27:16
Anyway, I did get a half-time job, 7th grade at a neighborhood school, Arleta
27:23
School, that’s where I started teaching.
27:25
Then I got hired at Boise Elementary School, and I was there for 2
27:30
or 3 years teaching fifth grade, took over a classroom there.
27:42
Were those schools in North Portland?
27:47
The school, first school I taught at was in southeast.
27:53
Then, Boise was school in north Portland.
27:57
It was predominantly a Black school, had very few White people.
28:04
Neighborhood had changed significant, and
28:08
was very crowded school.
28:10
That was the late ‘60s, I think, yeah, because it was a time when
28:16
a lot of the kids, especially the younger kids, and I had a fifth grade.
28:22
The kids would come to school, and
28:27
they had sort of attitudes about White people.
28:31
It wasn’t something I was used to, and so I found, I spent some time trying
28:37
to understand what was going on, but there was some overlap from—that was
28:44
the era of Black Power and the Panthers.
28:50
Our kids, some of our neighborhood kids, the kids that were going
28:53
to that school would come to school after going to a lunch or a
28:58
breakfast put on by the Panthers.
29:02
They were being indoctrinated with hostility.
29:06
An interesting that I found with that fifth grade class is the
29:09
first time I came in I said okay now everybody get out your books.
29:16
They said, we don’t have any books, because I was taking over
29:18
the class after Christmas break.
29:21
They said, we don’t have any books.
29:23
I said, you don’t have any books?
29:24
What do you mean you don’t have any books?
29:26
Everybody has books.
29:27
You’re at a school.
29:29
They said, no.
29:30
Our teacher took our books away.
29:31
I said, you’re teacher took your books away why?
29:35
They said, because we were drawing in them.
29:38
I said, what do you mean you’re drawing in your books?
29:40
You don’t draw in your textbook.
29:42
You draw on art paper.
29:44
So, I said, well what are you drawing?
29:48
It turned out, they were drawing afros on every figure that
29:54
was a person, male or female.
29:57
They were drawing afros of the heads of the people.
30:00
So, the teacher took away their language, their math, their reading whatever.
30:07
I said, well, no.
30:07
You’re going to have your books back and you’re not going to draw on them.
30:12
That’s out.
30:13
We’re not drawing in books.
30:15
They didn’t.
30:16
I think I was kind of a very strict teacher.
30:21
I had a facial expression that I guess told you I am not playing.
30:25
I am quite serious.
30:28
Anyway, that was an interesting thing.
30:30
I never experienced that before, and I don’t know if it happened universally but
30:36
it certainly happened at Boise school.
30:38
Anyway, they got their books back and we went on with our studies.
30:42
Were the other teachers in that school mainly White or Black?
30:47
That was kind of a mixture, mostly White, but about 5 or 6 Black
30:55
teachers, which I’d had experience with Black schools prior in Philadelphia
31:01
and, where else that I taught.
31:06
I didn’t have any problem with that, but it was kind of an angry.
31:14
The primary grades seemed to be fine.
31:16
They were almost all White teachers, and they just loved the little Black kids.
31:20
Sometimes I wondered did they teach them anything, but they loved them.
31:26
But the fifth and sixth grade—
31:27
What made you wonder if they were teaching?
31:30
Because the little kids were kind of out of control and I believed in control.
31:37
I believed in behavior that was, you know, calm.
31:47
When you’re in the playground that’s fine.
31:48
Let’s jump up and down and holler and scream and run and
31:51
shout as much as you want to.
31:53
In the classroom, you talk when you have permission.
31:59
You don’t run around the room like a bunch of, you know, banshees.
32:04
I didn’t have any of that in my classroom, and a new teacher, who was
32:08
a White teacher, across the hall from me was also a fifth grade teacher
32:13
and she had been trained to be a nun.
32:16
She was a young woman, but she was training to be a nun and then
32:19
decided to go into education.
32:21
She didn’t believe in upside down and running around.
32:25
She would get out of that classroom every evening and go talk to parents.
32:31
I did that, too.
32:32
Some of the younger, some of the other classrooms, I don’t think they
32:36
ever made any contact with parents.
32:38
I don’t think they, I think they just kind of, I was just
32:45
confused at what they were doing.
32:50
I think I was probably a little bit of a problem in terms of getting along
32:55
with everybody, because if you, you know, if you were treating kids like
32:59
it was a playground and they were in third grade that wasn’t working.
33:08
I would contact people and kind of confront them with
33:13
what are they learning?
33:15
You had a fourth grade class down the hall from me where the teacher was just sitting
33:22
on the, just you know, you’d walk by the classroom and he was not doing anything
33:28
with, kids running around the room, climbing on the desks, throwing things.
33:33
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
33:35
So, I made a few, not enemies but a little conflict from time to time.
33:43
After that school, what did you do?
33:47
Then, let’s see, I was there for I think about almost 3 years.
33:56
That school we had to work a lot with the parents to get, before I
34:04
left there, to get, they had a lot of retreats where parents would go and
34:09
they would talk about control in the classroom and what are kids learning and
34:16
how are we going to fix it?
34:18
What do we really want out of the school?
34:21
The district instituted a program, I think we were called advisory specialists.
34:30
They selected a group of Black teachers and
34:39
we were just a group to try to go into different classrooms throughout
34:44
the district and meet with teachers trying to help them understand
34:50
what they could do to improve the educational progress of Black students.
34:58
Because it turned out that a lot of the schools, especially the inner-city schools
35:03
where there were lots of numbers of Black kids, had the same problem of misbehavior
35:09
and not expecting educational outcomes.
35:12
This group called the advisory specialists, we would go as a team.
35:17
Usually it was one Black person with a White person who was a good, had been
35:24
a good teacher, and you would go into different schools, work with classrooms,
35:31
and you’d try to get the whole student body, not the student body, but the
35:34
teacher core of the teacher members in the school, and have meetings and
35:41
discuss what they were doing, how it was working, how it wasn’t working
35:45
and what they could do to improve.
35:48
Then we had training outside of the school year.
35:53
So, it’s your opinion that the reason, well, what is your opinion what, why do
36:01
you think these Black kids were having—
36:05
Misbehaving?
36:06
—particular misbehaving?
36:09
I think part of it was the era of the time that we were living in, the times
36:16
we were living in where there was
36:21
outspoken hostility.
36:25
You had neighborhoods in Portland where people will tell you when they were going
36:32
to school, and they’re my age, that you know they couldn’t walk down the street
36:36
without somebody calling them nigger.
36:40
That was offensive to a lot of people.
36:42
To me, it was just like whatever.
36:44
It’s your problem, not mine.
36:47
But if you have people
36:52
who recognize that they’re being picked on or they’ve been told by their
36:57
parents that White people don’t treat you right and everything like that.
37:04
You get an animosity and I think when you have more Black people coming into
37:10
the schools then there’s a clash between the White teachers who’d been there
37:19
and had been operating as thinking the little Black kids are so cute and so
37:25
darling and I don’t, you know, I’m not worrying about teaching them or anything.
37:29
They’re just cute little, I don’t know whatever you’re thinking.
37:35
I saw a lot of that.
37:41
I don’t know really how it developed, but if you listen to people who grew up
37:46
in Portland who were Black and you hear them talking about in their neighborhood
37:52
school they were always called nigger all the way home, you see, it bothered them.
37:59
It made you feel hostile toward White people, and I never experienced that.
38:05
I didn’t care what color you were.
38:08
My folks taught us we’re all the same.
38:13
But if you grew up with a different attitude, that’s I think how so much
38:19
separation happened in the school.
38:21
I never really analyzed it, but after I got into that
38:27
advisory program, and then I saw, you know there really are some problems, and
38:35
a lot of us, as we were called advisory specialists, White and Black, we’d
38:41
never analyzed it and we had a lot of
38:48
professional people come and present to us and teach us why teachers who
38:57
are White are having the problems they are about people who are not
39:02
White and why people who are Black have the problems that they’re having.
39:08
You had to find a way to come together or what value are you?
39:15
You’re teaching language arts.
39:17
You’re teaching math, but you’re really not getting it through to kids if they’re
39:24
burdened with this hostility and this misbehavior and this whatever, anger,
39:30
about I don’t like White teachers.
39:33
You’d hear kids saying things like that.
39:37
That’s not a good thing.
39:39
Did you feel that the advisory committees ended up being helpful?
39:45
I think it did a lot of good.
39:46
I think
39:55
the leaders in that could have done a better job, because this is something new.
40:01
Even professional people who came to us from wherever, Oakland or LA
40:06
or New York or Washington, D.C., we
40:11
needed a lot more of that and we needed people to—we needed people
40:17
who could overcome their own
40:22
anxieties, hostilities, whatever it was.
40:25
But if we hadn’t had that program, I think we would have gone deeply downhill.
40:34
It helped a lot.
40:36
I think it took a lot longer than you might have anticipated.
40:41
I was in the program for about 3 years and then I went into
40:48
high school as a vice principal.
40:51
Then I was just the mean lady, so [laughs]
40:55
. In the meantime, did you increase your education?
40:59
I
41:02
did.
41:02
Let’s see, I think while I was an advisory specialist, I had a master’s degree, and
41:12
then to go into administration you had to have completed a master’s degree and have
41:22
administrative training.
41:24
When did you get the master’s degree?
41:27
Let’s see, it was like I think ’74.
41:31
Was that before,
41:35
was that when you left Oregon, before you left Oregon?
41:38
No, no, no.
41:39
That was after—I got the master’s degree from the University of Portland.
41:44
Okay, tell us some about that experience.
41:48
Oh, you know.
41:49
That I don’t remember very much, except just going to class and writing papers
41:58
and it was at University of Portland.
42:05
I don’t remember much about the classroom,
42:11
just writing papers and doing the work required.
42:16
I don’t remember anything special.
42:19
I know the University of Portland,
42:24
it was in St. Johns area.
42:27
That was, I would say a very segregated area.
42:32
It had a reputation in St. Johns.
42:34
Where is the St. Johns area?
42:38
St. Johns is very far west Portland.
42:46
It, actually, was a separate town early in the 1800s when
42:51
Portland was just developing.
42:54
Then it was annexed.
42:59
It seemed to be St. Johns had a reputation of being unfriendly to minorities.
43:10
You
43:14
kind of think St. Johns being on, kind of on the north end, northwest
43:22
end of the Willamette River before you get to the Columbia River,
43:26
and then it was a separate town.
43:29
Then, as people moved down the river, they developed the town of Portland.
43:39
St. Johns was actually separate.
43:43
They’ve always had an attitude, we’re not Portland.
43:45
We don’t belong to Portland.
43:47
I don’t think it’s that way now, because it’s just been too long.
43:52
It’s always been kind of a part because of the way towns developed, and then
43:59
there was another community, north Portland, which was Albina District, and
44:06
Albina was a separate community, too.
44:10
Back then to St. Johns.
44:12
Then you were in school there.
44:14
At University of Portland.
44:14
At University of Portland, so...
44:18
But I didn’t do anything about the city.
44:21
I don’t remember ever going to a restaurant during the
44:26
time I went to school there.
44:28
Part of that probably was because I was teaching during the day.
44:34
I was either an advisory specialist or even maybe I was vice principal then.
44:40
I don’t know.
44:43
My memory is not so good there.
44:45
So,
44:47
the town of St. Johns, I never went to a grocery store or a restaurant or anything.
44:55
That was a
44:58
master’s in—?
45:00
Education.
45:01
In education.
45:02
Mm-hmm.
45:04
You got that so that you can continue to be teaching.
45:08
Right and become an administrator, a vice principal.
45:15
So, now your experience as a vice principal, what was that like?
45:21
[Laughs] It was very interesting.
45:24
I was at Grant High School, and Grant High School was an interesting
45:33
school.
45:34
Grant High School
45:39
had the reputation of being “the” school, the outstanding school. It was in an
45:45
area of the students came from Irvington, Alameda, very rich backgrounds, very rich
45:59
neighborhoods. You went to Grant, and you’re all of that and a bag of chips.
46:05
They were really, you know.
46:07
So, very few Black students had gone to Grant for a number of years.
46:15
If you talk to any students that I knew after, when they had grown up
46:21
and they had attended Grant when they were very minority, they will
46:28
tell you that Grant was bigoted.
46:33
They didn’t enjoy it.
46:35
They felt very isolated and very separated.
46:40
Yet, Grant had a reputation for being an outstanding school in terms of
46:44
what kids did and what they learned and what they grew up and how
46:49
professional, many professional people.
46:52
On the other hand, as a student I was at Franklin, and Franklin was just
46:57
one of those, you know, we weren’t looked upon as anything really.
47:03
But Grant was looked on as “the” school.
47:07
So, when I went there as vice principal,
47:16
first of all, there were very few Black administrators, let alone vice principals.
47:24
The student body had changed pretty significantly, because they changed the
47:28
boundaries of the neighborhoods, and one of the reasons that I went there, I went
47:35
there first as the advisory specialist.
47:38
I was working with kids who were Black who had wanted to attend Jefferson, which was
47:47
predominantly a Black school student body.
47:51
Because they had changed the boundaries, for whatever reason, some of those
47:55
Black kids had to go to Grant.
47:57
They
47:59
did not want them to be there.
48:02
There were a lot of conflicts, a lot of conflicts.
48:05
It
48:07
usually was, it would materialize after school and before school in terms of going
48:18
on the bus, because most of the Jefferson kids that had to go now to Grant had to
48:24
take a bus to get there, because they did not live close to Grant like many of the
48:29
other kids in the Grant neighborhood did.
48:34
It was fights and a lot of conflict, always having to get groups of kids
48:41
together to talk about how can we—you try to find a group of Black kids that had
48:48
good grades and sensible minds and parents who were supporting them, and then you
48:53
try to get a group of White kids that were trying to look at, okay, we understand
48:58
things are changing at our school.
49:00
We don’t have to be so isolated and think we’re all that and better than Black kids.
49:06
You try to put that group of kids together and expand it as you go
49:10
along and get more kids involved.
49:13
That took 3 or 4 years of constant working and it, people, grown people who
49:20
went, who have come out of Grant High School will tell you the experiences
49:26
they had, they did not like Grant
49:31
as a student, Black student going there.
49:34
They did not enjoy it.
49:35
They would not sing in the choir.
49:38
They would not get on the dance team, because it wasn’t cool.
49:45
It wasn’t cool for them, and it wasn’t really accepted for
49:50
the local neighborhood people.
49:53
You had to just constantly be bringing groups together and working
49:58
with people to try to make them understand, you know, come on.
50:02
Think about it.
50:04
You all put on your clothes the same way every day.
50:08
You all, you know?
50:09
Yeah, your hair is different.
50:10
Yeah, your skin is different.
50:13
Get over it.
50:14
In terms of the conflict, did they come—was it physical, too.
50:19
Did they fight with each other?
50:21
Oh yeah.
50:22
Kids get injured?
50:22
Yeah, they’d get in a fight.
50:25
I was talking to a group the other day about it, and somebody said,
50:30
when I said something about girls fighting, and they said when you
50:34
see them take those earrings off.
50:37
I said, oh I forgot about that!
50:39
That is something that I would always be outside walking around the campus and
50:44
trying to meet kids and say good morning and how’s it going, blah, blah, blah.
50:49
If I saw kids taking, girls taking those earrings out of their ears, I
50:55
knew I needed to be around that school, not in my office, because there was
51:00
going to be a fight somewhere that day.
51:03
So, bring that kid in with the earrings out, and let’s sit down
51:08
and figure out what’s your problem.
51:11
You’re not going to handle it by fighting, because fighting’s going
51:13
to send your little butt home.
51:16
So, let’s try to figure a way to work through whatever the issue is.
51:22
It was just a constant, constant get out there and figure out what the kids are
51:27
doing, figure out who’s mad at whom and why, whether they were Black or White.
51:34
You just had two separate—
51:37
What were some of the reasons that you found out that
51:41
they were mad at each other?
51:43
Well, I’ll tell you one thing, with Black girls, it was she
51:49
flung her—they’d say, well, that White girl flung her hair at me.
51:55
I said, and what did her hair do?
51:58
Well, I don’t know, she flung... I said, well, now, really, what did it do?
52:01
You’d just have to talk through it.
52:04
Then you’d have to go and find the White girl and say, now were you trying to be,
52:10
because you have long hair and it flies and my hair doesn’t, I’m Black and I have
52:15
kinky hair and it ain’t going nowhere.
52:18
Why are you
52:20
letting that bother you?
52:26
[Laughs] It was just a constant—first of all, trying to understand
52:31
what are you upset about?
52:33
Why does it upset you, and is it something that really—
52:39
What kind of response would the girls give?
52:42
What would they say?
52:43
Well, there would just be silliness, really, when you get down to it.
52:49
When you talked to them, were they receptive, hostile?
52:52
Often, mostly at first hostile, mostly not accepting.
52:58
Mostly, you don’t know what you’re talking about, well, you didn’t, you
53:02
always side with the White girls.
53:04
You this, you that.
53:05
You know?
53:06
I’m, it’s not about me.
53:08
You’re here to go, let’s try to figure out why you’re here and why everybody’s here.
53:15
We’re all here for the same thing.
53:18
What’s the best way, you know, for you to resolve the problem.
53:23
Think about it.
53:25
If you don’t like sitting near her because she flings her hair, then maybe you can
53:32
try to get the teacher to move your seat.
53:35
You don’t have to sit there.
53:37
It was just really basic things.
53:41
What about when you talked to the White girls?
53:44
The same thing.
53:45
How did that work and what was their response?
53:48
Usually, as I remember,
53:52
White girls at Grant who were good students and were there, you know, because
53:58
they were trying to get an education,
54:03
they had no understanding of what the problem or the anger
54:11
was of the Black student.
54:14
They had not experienced it before.
54:18
So, you’d have to try to explain to them, well,
54:25
it looks like you’re trying to, it looks like you, the White girl, are trying to
54:33
show somehow that you’re better or that you are more beautiful or
54:40
cuter or you’ve got better clothes.
54:46
When you do certain things, it’s like that’s, like you’re
54:51
throwing that in somebody’s face and do you need to do that?
54:57
It's just was just bringing sometimes them together where they could talk
55:02
it out and you sit here and you sit here and you’re not going to
55:05
fight because I’m in the middle.
55:09
It was not an easy thing.
55:10
It was not a quick thing, and you had to bring teachers into the awareness, too.
55:19
Most of the teachers are just into their subject: I’m the math teacher.
55:24
I don’t have time for blah, blah, blah.
55:28
PE is blah.
55:30
We’re here to do this and we aren’t going to... you know?
55:33
We don’t have time.
55:34
But, yes you do.
55:35
You have to have time, because here’s the problem that’s occurring and everybody
55:42
has to be a part of the solution.
55:46
Everybody has to work on it.
55:48
Then, after that how long were you the vice principal, then?
55:52
Let’s see, I think about 9 years?
55:56
8 or 9 years?
56:01
I really enjoyed it.
56:03
The only thing I can say I really got tired of [laughs] as vice principal, going
56:11
into the restroom and running the girls out for, you know, go back to class, and
56:19
I walk back to their class with them, or wherever, for smoking in the restroom.
56:28
Or, the thing I would have to work with Black girls a lot of times was
56:34
eating in the restroom at lunchtime.
56:38
Lunchtime could, you’d get your lunch and go and sit in the bathroom and eat it.
56:44
No.
56:45
Don’t do that.
56:46
Why are you doing that?
56:51
There was just such a disconnect between some of the kids and then
56:57
you had groups of Black kids and White kids that were just fine.
57:02
They had no problem with each other.
57:05
Even if they didn’t have interactions as elementary students, they could figure
57:12
it out as high school students in just being in their classroom together.
57:17
But you had a group that were just not there.
57:24
That’s the part where you had to work the most and keep at them.
57:30
The thing I really got tired of most was running the kids out of
57:34
the bathroom that were eating their food, their lunch, or smoking.
57:41
I was at the point of getting tired of that.
57:45
That’s when I got the invitation from the
57:49
superintendent.
57:51
They wanted me to come in the personnel office.
57:55
They always have an agenda, though.
57:57
You don’t know the agenda, because they don’t tell you.
58:01
They just tell you this is a wonderful experience and you could, you know,
58:09
more money and you don’t have to do this and you don’t have that.
58:13
That sounds good, but at the school you get summers off.
58:17
You don’t get summers off when you go into the central office.
58:21
Anyway, I did go in the central office in the personnel department.
58:28
I kind of found out that that was a place where they needed people of color, and
58:36
so I was the logical one, I guess, to go.
58:44
How was that?
58:45
What were some of your experiences?
58:47
I enjoyed it a lot.
58:49
It was a totally different viewpoint of the school, of school business,
58:55
because all of my other experiences had been in schools, either directly in
59:01
the classroom or in the central office.
59:04
It was totally separate from the school.
59:07
What was your-?
59:09
My role?
59:09
Your role, yes.
59:11
I went in as a, let’s see what was I called, I think I was
59:17
called a personnel specialist, and I was over the, what do you
59:25
call it, substitute department, substitute teacher department.
59:29
There were two, there was a team of I think 2 or 3 people that were the people
59:35
who called for substitutes every day.
59:41
So, I worked with them.
59:42
Then I also was interviewing people for job positions in the district,
59:51
and so that was very interesting.
59:56
Then we moved into, let’s see, well,
1:00:03
I found myself in conflict there a lot, quite a bit, too, because, here again,
1:00:08
I don’t, I tell it like I see it and sometimes I’m not too cool with that.
1:00:16
I was pretty direct.
1:00:18
For instance, I would have sometimes a principal who would say, well,
1:00:23
this substitute we want to hire her as a permanent teacher.
1:00:30
Is aid, a couple of times there were some people and they
1:00:33
happened to be Black teachers.
1:00:37
They were acting as substitutes, and they could do a fairly good
1:00:42
job of that with primary grades, like first and second grade.
1:00:48
But if you want to hire a teacher you want somebody who is intellectually
1:00:54
able to handle the subject matter of the second or the third grade
1:01:00
or first grade or whatever it is.
1:01:04
On a couple of occasions there were people they wanted to put a person of
1:01:09
color but that person wasn’t competent even though they were finishing
1:01:15
their degree at Portland State.
1:01:18
I had to ask who did their writing for them?
1:01:22
I would ask them to write something and they couldn’t do it.
1:01:29
I would say, I’m sorry, I don’t care what color she is.
1:01:32
I don’t care that you need, we need people of color.
1:01:35
Let’s find somebody.
1:01:37
There must be somebody who’s qualified, who’s competent if
1:01:42
they’re going to work with kids.
1:01:43
They have to be smarter than the kid.
1:01:48
I said, okay, to a couple, I said to the principal and one
1:01:51
of the area administrators.
1:01:54
Well, no, we’ll put her at X school, which was predominantly a Black school.
1:02:00
I said, oh, let’s put her up at Bridlemile, a predominantly White school.
1:02:04
Oh, no.
1:02:06
I said, well, if she’s not competent to go to Bridlemile,
1:02:10
she’s not competent to go to Boise.
1:02:14
We’re done.
1:02:14
I’m through talking, bye.
1:02:16
It
1:02:20
was reality, though.
1:02:22
See, you can’t be wishy-washy and do, you have ulterior motives, and
1:02:29
you saying we’re hiring Black people.
1:02:32
Yes, but let’s hire competent Black people.
1:02:36
I mean, she’s a very nice lady, but that’s not what she’s there for.
1:02:41
She’s there to teach the students.
1:02:45
That’s not fair.
1:02:48
They’ve got to have competent people who can teach.
1:02:53
Then, so, how long did you work there?
1:02:56
Then, I was there in that role for one year, and here’s another ulterior
1:03:02
motive that I finally figured out.
1:03:09
The superintendent and the assistant superintendent
1:03:14
said they wanted me to apply for the director of personnel, and I’d been
1:03:20
in personnel one year and I’m like all these people who are personnel
1:03:25
administrators they’ve been in here.
1:03:28
None of them were Black,
1:03:31
and they wanted to—and they did apply.
1:03:39
They didn’t get it.
1:03:40
I got it.
1:03:43
It took me a long time to figure out they wanted a Black woman, so that was me.
1:03:51
I enjoyed it.
1:03:52
I loved it, but it took a while for the rest of the people that I was, the rest
1:03:58
of the personnel administrators who had been there for years, but the same
1:04:05
administrator taught the administrators
1:04:11
who said they wanted me, but they didn’t tell me they wanted me except
1:04:16
to say well, you’re in personnel now.
1:04:19
You apply.
1:04:23
I thought, well, sure, okay.
1:04:25
I’ll apply.
1:04:26
I don’t see any reason why.
1:04:28
I
1:04:30
had no idea that they wanted a Black woman and you don’t think of things like that.
1:04:36
You just think, well, that would be interesting but I don’t know as much about
1:04:42
personnel stuff as some of these people who have been here for 5, 6, 10 years.
1:04:49
Then, they had to around and talk to all those long-term employees and
1:04:53
personnel and explain to them whatever, the reason why we need this person.
1:05:00
We’re having a lot of problems getting
1:05:06
professional Black people to apply for teaching positions in Portland, Oregon.
1:05:12
We did a lot of recruiting trips to go to southern states and other places like
1:05:21
Alabama and Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia.
1:05:27
When you think about it, as I went on one recruiting trip, if I could get
1:05:32
hired in Alabama, my home, where I’m going to talk to these people and they
1:05:38
are graduating from an Alabama school and they could get a job in their state,
1:05:42
why would they want to come to Oregon?
1:05:44
They don’t know anything about Oregon.
1:05:47
The only thing most of those people had heard about were the Trail Blazers
1:05:50
when they won in ’77, when they won.
1:05:54
They’re like, Oregon?
1:05:56
Where is it?
1:05:57
Don’t they have wooden sidewalks?
1:06:00
[Laughs] Stuff like it.
1:06:03
So, I ended up being in the personnel department.
1:06:06
Personnel, and then after that?
1:06:08
That was it.
1:06:09
That was it.
1:06:09
You retired.
1:06:10
I retired, after, I think 9 years as a personnel director.
1:06:15
Now, in your retired life, how are you spending your time?
1:06:20
Well, the minute I think I retired, my 3 daughters, especially two of them,
1:06:27
and one of my best friends who was a personnel administrator at that time,
1:06:33
said, well you’ve got to be busy.
1:06:35
You’ve got to find things to do.
1:06:37
They started
1:06:40
the Oregon Convention Center’s going to be built and they’re going to need volunteers
1:06:46
for their visitor information desk.
1:06:51
That’s the first thing I did.
1:06:55
Then I started singing in a barber shop choir.
1:07:04
I was doing, oh, I don’t know what all, just a whole lot of different
1:07:11
things, and a lot of fun things.
1:07:13
I became a tour guide for, I worked for that about 7 or 8 years, I guess.
1:07:21
For?
1:07:22
A tour guide for the city, giving tours of the city, giving tours
1:07:27
of, at that time, I think we were doing tours of Mount St. Helens.
1:07:32
That was very popular, and tours of the gorge.
1:07:37
That was my favorite one, the Columbia River Gorge.
1:07:41
You’d get a busload of people and they’d want to see the gorge and so you’d have
1:07:49
to learn a whole lot of facts about
1:07:54
technical things and fun things.
1:07:58
What year did you retire?
1:07:59
From Portland Schools?
1:08:01
Yeah, when you finished.
1:08:03
At the personnel department, I think that was ’89.
1:08:06
’89, and we’re now 2019.
1:08:09
’19, yeah.
1:08:10
So, you’ve got.
1:08:13
Yeah, quite a few years.
1:08:15
Quite a few years, 30 years.
1:08:16
Yeah.
1:08:19
I think I was a tour guide for, I was at
1:08:26
the personnel office, no, at the convention center for 20 years and that
1:08:34
took up a lot of time at the visitor information, something I enjoyed a
1:08:39
lot, until I got tired of telling people where they wanted to go to eat.
1:08:45
I don’t know where you want
1:08:49
to go eat [laughs] . Things like that.
1:08:51
Let’s see, then, volunteering there and being a tour guide, those were
1:08:57
my two most active activities.
1:09:02
Any special experiences there that you’d like to tell us?
1:09:08
Let me see if I’ve had any...
1:09:16
other than being, I can’t really think of anything
1:09:22
earth-shattering.
1:09:29
I can’t really think of anything that was fun, mostly fun things.
1:09:35
Okay.
1:09:37
Just a couple more questions, one is fill us in a little bit more, then, about you
1:09:45
and your family life as you were living in Portland and doing all the work.
1:09:49
All those
1:09:52
things?
1:09:52
Then as your children were growing up.
1:09:54
So, your mother participated a lot in childcare.
1:09:59
Tell us a little bit more, then, about the children and how you juggled everything.
1:10:08
Right.
1:10:08
I felt I was unbelievably fortunate to be living next door to Mom.
1:10:13
As I said, I think I said my mom had, she had 3 foster girls when
1:10:19
we first came back and they were about the same age as my girls.
1:10:28
So, Mom loved to cook.
1:10:32
That was just something she enjoyed.
1:10:37
She was cooking and the kids were eating and they’d go to school from Mom’s
1:10:43
house and come back to Mom’s house after school until I came home, especially
1:10:48
when I got in administration, sometimes I didn’t get home until very, very late.
1:10:56
Mom was in charge of the kids, but her kids were about the same age as mine,
1:11:02
so it was just 6 girls going crazy and Mom was very much in charge of them.
1:11:10
Like I said, she was a no nonsense person.
1:11:15
They knew what they had to do and I always said to my kids when I was vice principal,
1:11:23
one thing I don’t want to hear from any other vice principal or any
1:11:29
other principal that you’ve been in trouble at school, because I know all
1:11:35
the principals and vice principals.
1:11:38
I don’t want to hear it, so make sure I don’t.
1:11:41
Make sure you don’t get in any trouble at school.
1:11:46
That’s not going to work.
1:11:51
They were pretty good kids.
1:11:52
They were active in sports
1:11:58
and Rose Festival.
1:12:01
My oldest one became homecoming queen of Marshall High School her
1:12:06
senior year, very popular kids.
1:12:16
I can’t think of anything really earth-shattering,
1:12:22
except I did hear from one vice principal of my oldest daughter.
1:12:28
She really didn’t get in a fight, but she was the TA in a
1:12:38
PE gym class, where, middle daughter, who was the quiet one, the middle daughter
1:12:46
was a student in the class and my oldest daughter was the TA, teacher assistant,
1:12:50
and somehow one of the girls in the gym class threw something and hit little
1:12:59
sister in the eye, and older sister was going to take that little girl out.
1:13:09
She was the TA, she wasn’t supposed to be doing that, but she jumped on the
1:13:12
girl and really kind of beat her up before the teacher could get it settled.
1:13:20
Naturally she was sent to the office, and so I got a call from the vice principal.
1:13:26
He said, we sent your daughter home.
1:13:30
I thought, oh, no.
1:13:35
He said, she’s not suspended or anything, she just had to go home
1:13:39
because she got in a fight and that’s what we do, separate the kids.
1:13:44
When Mom went and got her home, she said, good.
1:13:50
You beat that girl up.
1:13:51
She said, because
1:13:56
whatever had happened hit second daughter, who was my mom’s favorite.
1:14:01
She said, you should have beat her—I thought, Mom!
1:14:05
Don’t tell the child to fight.
1:14:08
You know?
1:14:09
But that’s what she did.
1:14:13
It didn’t endanger any of her.
1:14:15
She was still popular and that year she was homecoming queen, so I
1:14:18
guess everything worked out alright.
1:14:21
Very popular girl.
1:14:23
Well, now, I just have kind of one last, couple of just very last questions.
1:14:31
When you look back at your life, what stands out most in your memory?
1:14:39
Oh, dear.
1:14:40
I haven’t really thought about
1:14:49
that.
1:14:49
I think when you look over things and overall when you think of all
1:14:55
the things that could have happened and did happen to other people that
1:15:00
you know, I’m just grateful that I never had any, you know, like serious,
1:15:14
you know, really bad things.
1:15:16
I guess I will think of one bad thing that happened when I
1:15:20
was 18 and learning to drive.
1:15:23
I had to spend 5 hours in jail because I was over-extending the speed limit
1:15:35
and I didn’t have a driver’s license at that time.
1:15:39
But over besides that I think I can’t think of anything that
1:15:44
was just, I mean, horrendous.
1:15:48
Five hours in jail waiting for my brother to come pick me up was
1:15:52
pretty bad, but generally speaking.
1:15:56
That, I overcame that and didn’t have any lasting record or anything about that.
1:16:06
I think my life was enjoyable.
1:16:09
I’m
1:16:12
thankful for the opportunities I had to learn and to extend my knowledge,
1:16:25
still trying to do that by reading everything I can get my hands on.
1:16:34
I just feel like I never let anything get me down, no matter how bad it
1:16:41
seemed, even, you know, like going through a divorce or moving around
1:16:47
quickly from place to place every 2 years could have been upsetting, but it was
1:16:57
kind of interesting because you learn new things and got
1:17:00
to see a lot of the country.
1:17:03
I think afterwards of retirement starting to travel, visit numerous places
1:17:12
throughout the world, that was something that I think a lot of people may not
1:17:17
have gotten, had the opportunity to do.
1:17:21
I’m really grateful I did have those opportunities.
1:17:28
Okay, well, thank you very much.
1:17:30
Very much welcome, and delightful talking with you.
1:17:34
Well, it’s delightful for me, for us, too.
1:17:39
I hope so.
1:17:40
Talking with you, and I actually know that there’d be lots, lots,
1:17:43
lots more that we could continue.
1:17:47
Well, it gets to be a lot when you really think of it, this many years.
1:17:52
You have an opportunity to do a lot of things.
1:17:57
Yeah.
1:17:58
Eighty-some years, wow.
1:18:01
I’m still dancing.
1:18:03
Oh, I, the dancing, I want this off-record, well, it can be on record.
1:18:11
I saw the Aletha movie, Aletha Franklin movie?
1:18:17
Oh, Aretha Franklin.
1:18:17
Uh-huh.
1:18:17
Did you see?
1:18:18
No.
1:18:19
I have not seen it.
1:18:20
Well, I think it was you that mentioned about doing the dancing.
1:18:26
I asked what kind of dancing?
1:18:30
Were you the person?
1:18:31
Or was somebody else, maybe, that we interviewed that was telling me
1:18:35
you go to the Cotton Club and part of, sometimes you do tap dancing.
1:18:40
Oh, I was going to take tap dancing one year, one summer, because my dad
1:18:48
could tap dance and I always wanted to, but I never took tap dancing lessons.
1:18:52
We would just do the popular dances, like, we’d call it the slow drag,
1:18:58
if you’re dancing with somebody.
1:19:01
What was another one?
1:19:03
The spin?
1:19:05
I can’t remember the names of the dances, but the swing.
1:19:08
Just,
1:19:11
you know, the popular dances of the time.
1:19:15
I loved dancing.
1:19:17
It was a lot of fun.
1:19:19
Do you still do any dancing?
1:19:20
Do you have energy for that?
1:19:24
There’s, sometimes I listen to KMHD almost all the time.
1:19:28
Any time they play something that’s moveable, I’m trying to move.
1:19:32
It gets me going.
1:19:35
My girls are good dancers, and my granddaughter, who’s
1:19:39
here, she’s a good dancer.
1:19:40
You got to keep moving, even if you don’t go out and dance.
1:19:46
You got to keep moving.
1:19:51
There was, that whole film was the film
1:19:56
of her doing a whole gospel concert, and so at a certain some people
1:20:03
stood up and there was this little group of women that were tap dancing.
1:20:08
Oh.
1:20:09
That were doing, and so someone else said something, told us
1:20:14
that she used to tap dance.
1:20:16
Not me.
1:20:17
So, I wanted to ask is that the tap dancing?
1:20:20
I was doing to take tap dancing, because my dad could tap dance.
1:20:24
I don’t know where he learned but he could tap dance.
1:20:30
But, you know, growing up as an Adventist, dancing was not something
1:20:35
that you did, but because my dad tap danced, I mean, I danced.
1:20:43
My folks
1:20:48
didn’t restrict us dancing.
1:20:50
I remember one time my brother and I when we were in grade, oh, we were in
1:20:54
high school, I guess, and we both, we would play the piano duets, marching
1:21:01
duets for the members of the church who were Seventh Day Adventist who would
1:21:09
march around the floor of this hall that they were having this activity in.
1:21:17
We were playing the piano, playing marches, as a duet.
1:21:23
I thought to myself, now they don’t want us dancing but here they are marching.
1:21:27
What’s the difference?
1:21:30
You’re on your feet and you’re moving.
1:21:32
What’s the?
1:21:34
I could never quite figure that out.
1:21:36
Well, was it maybe the difference between...
1:21:37
Moving your hips?
1:21:38
...marching or moving your hips?
1:21:39
Yeah, right, right, right.
1:21:42
Evidently, dancing was seen as a little too sin-uous or something.
1:21:48
Marching you just straight line around in a circle.
1:21:53
It wasn’t working with me.
1:21:54
I said, dancing’s
1:21:57
okay.
1:22:00
You don’t have to do pole dancing [laughs] . Move your feet and
1:22:04
move your body a little bit.
1:22:09
Well [recording skips] barber shop?
1:22:10
Oh, barber shop.
1:22:11
Yeah for years.
1:22:12
Tell us more about all that music, then.
1:22:15
Well, I think I started barber shop shortly after retiring.
1:22:24
Yeah, I was retired when I started.
1:22:25
My
1:22:28
girls got me into that, because I really, you know, barber shop has
1:22:33
always been, growing up you thought of, it was almost blackface kind of
1:22:40
a thing in the early days, because
1:22:45
barber shop was four-part harmony.
1:22:48
At first it was men, four men singing.
1:22:53
They were doing, was it kind of Stephen Foster type music?
1:22:58
Dixie?
1:23:00
Talking about the old folks, old Black Joe and all the folks at
1:23:04
home and all that kind of stuff.
1:23:06
So, it wasn’t something that you know you really were too interested in.
1:23:16
I loved the music.
1:23:17
I loved the harmony, but I didn’t know anything about it.
1:23:20
When you would see barber shop, you would see these four men and they
1:23:27
were singing “Old Black Joe” or
1:23:31
“Down by the Suwanee River” or something.
1:23:34
It just seemed very racist, almost.
1:23:40
When I started, you know, when I got interested in Barber
1:23:45
Shop was because my girls were
1:23:52
in a restaurant where a group of women who were in a barber shop chorus, which
1:24:00
I knew nothing about, and they had come there after their rehearsal to unwind and
1:24:06
have some beers and spaghetti or whatever.
1:24:09
My kids were in there, and they were singing.
1:24:13
My girls came home and they said, Mom, you should hear those ladies singing.
1:24:18
You would love it.
1:24:19
They have harmony and it’s beautiful, a four-part harmony.
1:24:23
You should get in that group.
1:24:26
I was like, oh, here’s something else they want me to do.
1:24:30
Well, I went to one of their, a barber shop chorus, and it was a
1:24:34
group of about 50 women at that time.
1:24:37
It was called Blue Lake Chorus.
1:24:40
Their harmony was awesome, four-part harmony.
1:24:45
I said, I’m going to get up there.
1:24:47
They didn’t have any Black people in it.
1:24:51
About 50 women, 50, 60 women.
1:24:53
I said, I’m going to start singing.
1:24:55
I don’t know that they liked me or not, but I got in it and I sang bass.
1:25:00
Did you have to try out?
1:25:02
You had to try out and so the director, she had a group of people at the time,
1:25:07
and she said, okay just sing this line.
1:25:10
So, then they would tell if you were high, had a high voice, or low voice.
1:25:15
I have a bass voice.
1:25:17
So, I got in it.
1:25:19
Well, you know what?
1:25:21
After I got in it, I know there were people who thought what’s she doing here?
1:25:28
They showed it.
1:25:31
If they were trying to get me out of it, they were wasting their
1:25:34
time, because I’m not paying attention to foolishness like that.
1:25:39
I’m just here to sing.
1:25:43
You know there were people that didn’t, you know, you’d get placed
1:25:48
on the chorus on the risers.
1:25:50
They have steps, you know, and they have the bass usually is in the middle of
1:25:54
the chorus and then they mix the rest of the voices, the tenors, they spread
1:26:00
some here, they spread some around.
1:26:02
But the bass is usually a wedge in the middle, because that’s the foundation of
1:26:09
the chord when you’re singing barber shop.
1:26:12
You got to have a strong bass foundation.
1:26:19
I’m right in the middle.
1:26:20
Well, there was one lady, she didn’t want to stand by me and it was obvious.
1:26:25
If she got placed by me, and once you got a position, that’s where
1:26:30
you went each night of rehearsal.
1:26:33
She had asked to be moved, and so, no problem.
1:26:38
Let somebody else will stand and she moved around.
1:26:41
Well, I didn’t know what the woman’s problem was.
1:26:46
She sang for a number of years and she’d always stand away from me, and
1:26:52
one day, actually we were in a contest and we were away from, we were like
1:27:00
in Idaho competing or something.
1:27:04
She said she wanted to take my picture.
1:27:08
I thought, you don’t even speak, I thought to myself, you don’t even speak to me.
1:27:12
What do you want to take my picture for?
1:27:14
I said, well, okay.
1:27:20
She said, okay, so she takes my picture.
1:27:23
I found out later, I asked her, I said, what are you
1:27:28
going to do with this picture.
1:27:30
She said, oh, I want to show it to my family.
1:27:33
We’re having a family reunion in, it was either Kentucky or Missouri, I
1:27:43
think it was Missouri, and I want to show my family who I stand next to.
1:27:49
I said, who you stand next to?
1:27:52
She said, yes, but she didn’t want to say that I’m standing next to a Black
1:27:56
person, because she probably wasn’t to say Black person to her family.
1:28:00
She was probably going to say, standing next to this nigger woman,
1:28:02
is probably what she was going to say.
1:28:04
But she didn’t say that to me.
1:28:07
You know, I thought, that’s very interesting.
1:28:11
I said, well, I hope your family enjoys seeing the picture.
1:28:17
I’m like, oh my God [laughs] . It’s just an interesting experience, but that
1:28:26
probably was my only... I knew there were other people in the chorus that didn’t,
1:28:31
you know, they didn’t take time with you.
1:28:33
You can’t take time with everybody, so who cares?
1:28:37
Did you ever become friendly with any of the people?
1:28:39
Oh yeah, real tight buddies.
1:28:41
In fact, I sang in 3
1:28:44
quartets, which means four of us come out and we competed and yeah, I sang,
1:28:50
I’m still singing with barber shop group.
1:28:53
The same group?
1:28:53
No.
1:28:54
No.
1:28:54
I’ve left the chorus, because that chorus got bigger and better and
1:29:01
got competitive to the extent that I couldn’t spend that much time.
1:29:06
After I got older, it was harder to stand on the risers for 2 hours.
1:29:11
Your knees give out and you’re not just standing and singing.
1:29:16
You’re doing movements, too.
1:29:20
You’re doing step movements as well as hand and shoulder movements.
1:29:25
It got to be a little too much.
1:29:28
Being competitive means you have to put in a lot more hours of practice,
1:29:33
and I just got so I couldn’t do that.
1:29:37
It went on for a long period of time.
1:29:41
Well, that’s interesting.
1:29:43
I think that we’ll terminate now, because otherwise I’ll keep asking you
1:29:48
more things and we’ll go on and on.
1:29:50
[Laughs] Okay.
1:29:50
Thank you so much.
1:29:53
Thank you!
1:29:55
It’s been wonderful talking to you.
