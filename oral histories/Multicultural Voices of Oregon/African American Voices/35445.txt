00:00
The interview with Judy Boyer, October 22, 2019,
00:09
starting at 3:00.
00:14
Well, Judy, you’ve kind of gone through an interview already
00:19
while listening to your husband.
00:21
This one won’t be very much different except for everything that you say.
00:25
Okay.
00:25
So, I understand you were born here.
00:28
So, tell us about starting from, I guess, when you were born and your early life
00:38
here in Portland and what that was like.
00:42
Okay, well, I was a first generation in my family born here.
00:46
My folks came out of Texas in the early ‘40s to come to work
00:52
in the shipyards when they
00:56
could earn the same amount of money as anyone in the White race, the same
01:01
hourly wage in the shipyards once the defense department had integrated
01:08
the armed services contracts.
01:12
So, my dad came out first from Texas and left my mom and two older
01:16
siblings in Texas and sent 6 months later he sent for the family.
01:24
When he came by himself he had one name and one phone number.
01:29
It was a distant cousin of my mom’s.
01:33
He found
01:37
the relative, Eddie Butler, who
01:45
helped him get situated in Portland.
01:49
He got housing in Vanport, and they lived in Vanport until a year before the flood.
01:57
So, that was 1947 that they moved out of Vanport and bought a
02:01
house on Northeast Rodney Street.
02:05
That first little Victorian house cost them about $1,500.
02:10
They probably paid cash for it because they were making money at the shipyards.
02:15
My dad said he couldn’t hardly make $50 a month in Texas, and he was putting
02:21
$50 a week in savings from working at the shipyard, so it just made a huge
02:27
difference in the life of our family.
02:31
I had a sister, Trudy, who was born in
02:38
1946 in Portland, and I was born in 1949 a year after the flood.
02:43
So, we actually had, were living on Rodney Street when I was born.
02:49
The flood happened in ’48.
02:52
As I understand from the family that they housed some of the survivors of the
02:58
flood, because everybody took somebody in.
03:01
It was just devastating when the flood happened.
03:06
My folks stayed there.
03:08
My dad was a union painter.
03:11
He, after working at the shipyards got a job at the veteran’s hospital up on
03:19
the hill, the U.S. veterans’ hospital.
03:24
He was a union painter up there.
03:27
My mom was more of a home maker, but she also did domestic work.
03:33
My earliest memories are waking up in somebody else’s house and listening for
03:40
the vacuum cleaner or listening where she might be washing dishes or something and
03:46
wandering around a big home looking for her, because she was a domestic worker.
03:53
She got about $15 a day plus carfare.
03:57
We didn’t have a car.
03:58
She rode the bus.
04:00
We rode the bus.
04:02
But I started school at the age of 4 because I had a late birthday in
04:05
November, so I started kindergarten.
04:08
By that time, in 1952, they moved out to Montavilla, which is like a
04:13
White working class neighborhood, on northeast 75th, and Burnside, close
04:20
to one of the larger churches are now.
04:24
Highland Community Church is out on northeast Glisan, on 76th.
04:28
Well, we lived right around the corner from there.
04:31
They had that house from 1952 until 1994, when they sold it.
04:40
My siblings and I, we went to school at Vestal.
04:46
My older siblings, they started in the inner northeast
04:49
schools and they hated to move.
04:52
They were in 7th and 8th grade when they had to move out of the neighborhood,
04:55
and my sister just above me, you know, we didn’t know too much else,
05:00
except the Montavilla neighborhood.
05:03
I understand from my parents that there was resistance for them to move out there.
05:10
I know my father said that a White broker had to show them the house.
05:17
We had a 4 bedroom, 1 and a half bath house that was on a double lot.
05:23
The neighbors were not really friendly, but their children were.
05:29
We had just such a huge play area and a wonderful patio in the back
05:34
and brick barbeque outside, and my loved, loved, loved to have us home
05:40
and invited our friends to come there.
05:43
So, we had talent shows and all kinds of things in the backyard.
05:47
You know, gradually over the years the neighbors started coming around,
05:51
even though they were all White.
05:52
There were probably maybe 5, 4 or 5 Black families out there at that time.
06:01
Interesting coming up,
06:06
my parents had belonged to a Lutheran church, an African American majority
06:11
Lutheran church on northeast Russell Street when they still lived on Rodney.
06:15
Well, that disbanded probably in the early ‘50s, and my dad said because now
06:23
we live in Montavilla we’re going to join the closest Lutheran church, and
06:28
it happened to be a church, Holy Cross Lutheran, that was on 87th and Burnside.
06:33
We’re the only Black family and, of course, the older sister and brother they
06:39
didn’t participate as much as my older sister and I did, mainly because they
06:46
were, you know, they were teens by then.
06:50
They really wanted to be more inclusive and more with their friends and they
06:54
didn’t appreciate the isolation of being so far away from the community
06:59
that they actually came up in.
07:05
My folks saw an opportunity for me as the youngest child for me to
07:09
go to a Lutheran parochial school.
07:12
So, when I was in the fourth, fifth grade, one of the members of our
07:20
church was the principal of the school.
07:22
Five churches got together and they came up with this school
07:25
and five churches supported it.
07:27
It was on 136th and Powell.
07:30
It was way far away from home, but they did have a school bus.
07:38
Myself and
07:41
my nephew, who was 5 years younger than me, we went out there.
07:45
He was in kindergarten.
07:47
I was in the fifth grade.
07:48
We were the only Black students in the White school, but the school
07:52
only had probably 150 students.
07:56
It was
07:59
very interesting, very interesting.
08:01
Being in that setting,
08:05
I have always been more of an extrovert.
08:08
My sister next to me, she wouldn’t go, because she didn’t even like the whole
08:11
idea of being isolated that much while the public school that we attended in
08:17
Montavilla maybe had 15 students of color.
08:24
She didn’t want to go somewhere where there was none, just us.
08:31
That takes us up to
08:34
my grade school years.
08:37
By the time high school came around, well, the older siblings had gone
08:41
to Washington Highschool, which was very, pretty much integrated.
08:45
My sister above me went to Madison Highschool, which probably had,
08:52
maybe just under a dozen
08:56
Black students.
08:58
I went to Girls’ Polytechnic, which probably had of 500, or
09:06
600 students, maybe close to 100.
09:10
That was just so eye-opening and wonderful for me.
09:14
I loved it, because there was diversity.
09:16
It wasn’t just me in that school.
09:20
I really thrived.
09:22
I enjoyed that opportunity.
09:26
When I got out of high school, my folks didn’t have money to send me to college.
09:33
I got encouragement from some of the teachers, because they thought that
09:36
I was college material, but you know not having had that in the family yet.
09:43
What I could afford was I could go to a business college and I could sign
09:48
a contract for $1,000 to send me one year to this business college for, I
09:54
was on the legal secretarial arena.
10:01
When I came out of there, I had good skills, good clerical skills
10:05
that you don’t learn so much now.
10:07
I was probably, you know, I knew a shorthand, and I could take
10:11
shorthand at 120 words a minute.
10:12
I could type about 80 words a minute.
10:15
I knew all the business machines at that time.
10:20
I went out looking for a job and got a job within a month,
10:27
starting working for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company that was
10:30
in Northwest Industrial Area.
10:33
The woman at the employment office, a Black woman at the employment office, she
10:38
said, Judy, she said, we have something.
10:40
I want to take you out on this job.
10:42
So, she said, but they’ve never had anybody of color in their office.
10:48
So, how do you feel about that?
10:49
I said, I grew up in Montavilla.
10:52
I went to school where I was the only one.
10:56
I said, it doesn’t bother me.
10:57
I know who I am.
10:59
She took me out there and I can remember the interview.
11:03
The office manager came out to me and he said, we have a position open
11:10
for a, I think at that time they called them girl Friday or something.
11:19
He said, so I’m not going to waste your time and you won’t waste my
11:22
time, let’s just get ride down to the testing that we’re going to do.
11:27
I said, okay.
11:29
So, he put me in a room and what he did, he dictated 3 paragraphs to me, totally
11:37
different subjects, and he said now what I want you to do is take this down.
11:43
He said, be able to transcribe it, type it up for me, and give
11:47
it back to me so I see how you do.
11:50
I’m saying, alright.
11:53
This was probably the easiest test I ever had in my life because I
11:56
just got out of business college.
11:58
I was doing things so many levels higher than this.
12:03
When I took it down.
12:06
He said, you need to know where one paragraph ends and a new paragraph starts.
12:11
You know, 3 different subjects, okay.
12:14
So, I did that and typed it up for him, gave it back to him.
12:21
He came in, he said, oh.
12:23
We’ve never had anybody do this well.
12:25
I said, this well?
12:26
He said, yeah, you didn’t have one mistake.
12:29
I said, okay.
12:31
He said, so, we would like to offer you the job.
12:38
He said, it pays $400 a month,
12:43
which was pretty good at that time.
12:45
I just interviewed with a lawyer’s office and they wanted to pay me $350 a
12:48
month and I thought that was pretty low.
12:51
So, I said okay.
12:53
He said, so you’ll be starting in, you know, a week and a half whatever it was.
13:01
I didn’t have a car at that time, so the woman from the employment
13:03
office, she was waiting for me.
13:05
I went out to the reception area and I told her, I said,
13:07
well, I guess I got the job.
13:09
She said, you did?
13:10
I said, yeah.
13:11
We got in the car and I told her everything about it.
13:13
She said, oh, I’m so proud.
13:15
Well, I was 19.
13:18
I said, okay.
13:20
You know?
13:20
That sounds pretty good to me.
13:24
I worked there 5 years.
13:30
It was probably the best training I’ve ever had in my life.
13:34
I had several people I worked for in that setting.
13:39
I went from the girl Friday position to working for the credit manager
13:44
to working for the person who was over all the Goodyear service
13:48
stores in the state of Oregon.
13:50
I worked for the chemical sales manager.
13:52
He taught me how to fill out the export papers, because we sent carloads of
14:00
paint resin and rubber up to Canada, just some of the best training in the world.
14:07
In five years, I was kind of ready for me to move on.
14:13
They hated to see me go, but I did.
14:15
I left.
14:21
I thought that I would have good opportunities other places.
14:28
I tried a couple of places.
14:29
I went to one of the utility companies, and they saw my background and they said,
14:34
you know, you have wonderful training.
14:37
You have a good record, but we cannot put you in a position that pays what
14:44
you want within the next 6 months because that’s just our policy.
14:50
You start at this level before you can have your first promotion.
14:54
I said, okay.
14:55
I said, well, I’ll start.
14:58
So, they said, oh, we’d hate for you to.
15:00
There was about 3 or 4 men sitting around me.
15:05
They said, we know that you’re going to get frustrated with this
15:12
little whatever type of clerk job that they had, because I wanted one
15:18
of the good secretarial positions and they just couldn’t put me in.
15:23
I said, that’s okay.
15:24
I still will start with you.
15:28
But they were right.
15:29
Within 3 months somebody came to me and said, hey, we heard about your
15:34
training, we’d like you to come.
15:36
It was TriMet, a person at TriMet that knew of my skills,
15:43
and said in 1974 they needed to integrate the offices of TriMet.
15:48
They had never had people of color in the office.
15:52
So, in April of 1974, I think there was 4 of us Black women that we integrated
15:58
the offices in various departments, and I was in the employment department.
16:03
I stayed there about 5 years.
16:11
That was my introduction into employment and understanding what that meant, that
16:18
when you go to the personnel office, or employment office, exactly what happens
16:23
there, specifically to Black folks.
16:26
I saw some things there that I didn’t quite understand that I questioned a lot.
16:33
I knew they had had lawsuits because of some of the practices that had happened.
16:41
So, I was there to help.
16:42
Give us some examples, concrete examples of those things.
16:46
Probably the testing.
16:48
They gave a test when you came in, especially if you were going to be a
16:51
driver, and the test consists of maybe about 25 questions and you had, I believe,
17:01
30 minutes, maybe, to fill out that test.
17:08
The manager or coordinator of that office that I worked for,
17:17
I would see that he would have people come in and maybe people had
17:21
recommended or his friends or whatever,
17:25
and he might have them fill out the test with a pencil.
17:31
Then, if they didn’t complete or get all of them correct
17:37
he might change and answer.
17:42
I watched that
17:46
practice, and I encouraged people when they came in to
17:56
take their time to see what they could do and not only that but to be sure and call
18:06
back for the results of their test to me.
18:09
They’d walk out the door and say ah, man.
18:11
You know, that just went so, I don’t know how.
18:13
I said, please call me back and let me know how you did.
18:16
I’ll let you know how you did on the test.
18:21
There were things that you couldn’t help a person with when they came in for
18:25
a test at TriMet—that’s their driving record and they had to pass drug tests.
18:32
Sometimes when you have a test and maybe a person, maybe they finished
18:37
20 questions in the timeframe, but those 20 questions, I mean 18 of them
18:44
were correct, but maybe they were just reading just a little bit slower.
18:49
I would talk to the associate there, I’d say, hey look at this, you know?
18:54
They said, oh yeah.
18:56
I think they would get the rest of these.
18:59
I think its part of interceding for people at the right time, at the right place.
19:06
A
19:11
lot of people
19:14
came onboard in ’74 and ’75 at TriMet, drivers, etc. They didn’t
19:21
have, before that, they didn’t have a lot of women drivers and
19:25
specifically Black women drivers.
19:28
One thing they said about women, they said, oh, you know, they’d
19:32
have female problems and stuff and they can’t drive a bus and that
19:36
kind of—I said, that’s baloney.
19:37
I said, women are out here doing everything.
19:39
They’re driving school busses every day, why can’t they drive a city bus?
19:43
So, there was a lot of interceding that had to go there.
19:46
I wasn’t that popular because, not only was I for fairness but I also
19:52
became a union activist there.
19:54
That’s the first time I belonged to a union, the Amalgamated Transit Union
19:59
Local 757 and try to change some things around in the policies and things.
20:06
After 5 years, the national AFL-CIO, they had a subregional office in
20:13
Portland and they came after me, they asked me to come for work them.
20:17
I went to work for them.
20:20
That started my political career.
20:24
One of my managers I worked for was, he was over the whole western
20:31
region for the Committee on Political Education, Walter Gray.
20:37
The other one was a field representative for the same region
20:41
and his name was Bill Fitzgerald.
20:43
I learned so much under those two men.
20:47
I was able to become a charter member of the A. Philip Randolph Institute
20:54
that was with just a handful of other Black union activists as
21:00
well as some White union activists.
21:03
They saw a need to have a chapter here in Portland.
21:08
As Mr. Boyer said, that’s where we met.
21:12
I had been on board and somebody invited him to come to one of our
21:15
meetings and it kind of went from there.
21:20
Lots of political, local, regional, and national politics, where I was able to—
21:28
Describe that.
21:28
Give us some content and all of that.
21:30
Well, you know
21:39
my father had always been very interested in politics and we would
21:46
talk politics at home and my brother.
21:49
We would talk politics.
21:55
My dad, once I got that job, he wanted to know so much about, he was so
22:00
interested and I was so excited to let him know some of the things that
22:05
I was going to be involved in, some of the local races that would happen.
22:11
You know, the mayoral race or the house seats or the senate seats,
22:16
that sort of thing, but when it came to some of the national races.
22:21
I mean, I remember when Ron Wyden,
22:26
he was challenging Bob Duncan, and Bob Duncan had been a long-time
22:35
supporter of union and good democrat and that sort of thing.
22:41
The guy I worked for, I said, hey, I said, you know this Ron Wyden he’s
22:46
coming up and he’s with the seniors and he’s been one of their supporters and
22:52
he’s coming to meetings and we’d have this A. Philip Randolph Institute and
22:56
we’d meet at night and he was coming over there on Union Avenue and coming
23:01
to the place where we were meeting at.
23:02
I’m saying, he’s fierce.
23:04
I’m said, you know, he’s really going to challenge Bob Duncan some of the things.
23:10
Bob had been in there for quite a while.
23:14
The same thing, another woman from the labor council, she and
23:17
I would sit and talk about this.
23:18
We think there’s going to be an upset in this race because we just,
23:22
you know, our ear was to the ground.
23:23
We were grassroots.
23:25
Sure enough, I mean Ron got in and you know had been there ever
23:30
since and now he’s a senator.
23:33
Presidential elections—I can remember when President Carter’s campaign,
23:43
because we were so active with voter education and voter registration
23:46
in the A. Philip Randolph here in the late ‘70s and into the ‘80s.
23:54
When he was going to run for his second, run for reelection, and I got
24:04
a call on a Saturday from his campaign office that they had here in Portland.
24:09
They said, you know the president’s going to come here on election eve and we
24:14
need some community folks and some Black folks to show up at the airport for him.
24:22
I says, okay.
24:25
So, we understand that your organization that you’ve been doing
24:29
some things and gathering people.
24:31
I said, okay.
24:34
So, this was on a Saturday morning, and he was going to be here because the
24:40
election was on Tuesday, he was going to be here on Monday evening, election eve.
24:45
He was going to fly into Portland.
24:47
They wanted a lot of people to be out to the Portland airport to support him.
24:54
They said we want to know what it would take for you to get
24:57
some people out to the airport.
25:01
I got off the phone,
25:05
I called one of the men I worked for, Walter Gray, who was the COPE, Committee
25:13
on Political Engagement, Director, and I said hey, I got this call.
25:18
Can a campaign give me money to put on an event?
25:22
He said, you make sure that they make it out whatever they give you
25:28
to the organization so that you guys, not you personally, doing the thing.
25:35
I said, okay.
25:36
He said, good luck [laughs]
25:41
. So, we started working on it and got a whole, we said,
25:45
well, okay, what can we do?
25:47
So, we said, okay, first of all in order to get people out to the airport and
25:52
get them at 5:00 in the evening and want their families to go out there, we have
25:57
to have a carrot—that’s going to be food.
25:59
Okay, what kind of food?
26:00
Well, one of Bob’s friends he had a barbeque thing.
26:05
So, we said, okay, so we called him and said, what would it take if we put up some
26:11
barbeque sandwiches and stuff, pop, and
26:17
how do you prepare that for Monday?
26:19
Can you do that if we wanted to do this for maybe about 300 people?
26:26
Yeah, I can do it.
26:27
You’re willing to pay me?
26:28
So, he gave us a good price and everything.
26:30
I said, because that’s the only thing we had to pay for was the food.
26:36
We had a place where we could print the flyers.
26:38
We said, now where should we go?
26:40
We went up to the King Facility, which was the neighborhood facility, and we
26:44
made sure that we distributed flyers around that whole area within a mile
26:49
circumference of that whole area.
26:51
Then we contacted transportation, somebody had a connection with the school buses.
26:59
I had worked at TriMet, so I had friends who were drivers.
27:02
They would drive the school buses, school buses they were
27:07
going to let us use those free.
27:11
So, we had an assembly line set up at King Facility.
27:15
We were packing the barbeque sandwiches and putting them in coolers as well
27:20
as a cooler of pop and then loading them on buses and as people came in
27:26
we told them a certain time to come in to be there at 5:00 or whatever.
27:31
We would load them on the school buses.
27:33
We filled up 7 school buses, and they had the food on the buses.
27:37
Took them to the airport, the kids and all could go out there and made sure that
27:42
every bus they had a count of who they had out there so they wouldn’t leave people.
27:47
They stayed out there for the flight to come in and then they
27:50
came all the way back and stuff.
27:53
A wonderful experience.
27:55
I hadn’t done one like that before, and so it kind of cut our teeth on that sort
28:01
of thing for national politics, and that was kind of the start of other campaigns.
28:07
How did you get the school buses organized to have them on that day?
28:11
Well, that’s another story, but it’s a friend who had a friend.
28:17
That old favor.
28:19
We got those 7 school buses and I had the contacts with the drivers
28:24
that the TriMet, these friends of mine would drive these school buses.
28:28
But,
28:30
no pay.
28:32
Those were favors.
28:35
There would have been like a technical thing to do with getting permission
28:41
in case for insurance and that.
28:43
Mm-hmm.
28:46
Some things in politics you just kind of let it go, at least then.
28:52
Now, it’s a little different, a lot different [laughs]
28:56
. How
28:59
you can?
28:59
We didn’t ask a lot of details back then when things were happening.
29:05
So, tell me then,
29:09
you met your husband, and so tell me a little bit more about your family life.
29:17
Well, we had each been in a previous marriage and I had one daughter.
29:25
He had 5 kids.
29:27
We have a blended family that came together, and
29:35
we were very concerned about the future for our children, what
29:40
this world was going to look like.
29:43
So, we worked very hard on all types of issues that involved equity and education
29:51
as well as other community issues to make sure that things are going to be right.
29:59
But, I guess we had the same
30:06
I don’t know, I guess we had the same attitude that you have to work on it,
30:14
you have to be part of the solution.
30:16
You can’t talk about the problem.
30:20
I saw that in him and what he had done so much more because him being
30:26
several years older than me and he had really done a lot in the community.
30:35
Mine was more geared toward what I was doing with my jobs and
30:40
what it had to do with the labor movement or that sort of thing.
30:45
Then it branched out, once it got into the political arena and you
30:48
see that encompasses everything.
30:50
It’s political how much you pay for a loaf of bread.
30:54
Everything’s political.
31:00
Explain that a little more.
31:02
Well, you know when people say that, oh, I’m just not political or I
31:08
don’t get involved in things, and it’s very interesting, it only takes
31:12
one issue to get a person involved.
31:15
I would hear Barbara Roberts talk all the time, the former governor, that she
31:20
wasn’t involved until she had a special needs child that she didn’t think was
31:23
being served by the school district.
31:25
A lot of people are one issue folks, and that’s when they start getting
31:30
involved and then you see there’s so much more involved in that.
31:34
I know my folks they each had 10 sisters and brothers and they were the
31:38
pioneers that came out here to Oregon.
31:41
They know things they couldn’t do in Texas that they could do out here while
31:45
Portland, while Oregon is challenging because it is such a White state,
31:53
and Portland’s such a White city.
31:55
They still knew there was an opportunity for them to do more than what they
32:01
did from where they came from.
32:03
They took advantage of those opportunities.
32:05
One thing they did not do for their four children and grandchildren, they
32:13
did not tell us the stories, those horrible stories that they came up with.
32:19
We didn’t know until we were much older the challenges that they had but I think
32:24
they were trying to keep us optimistic to know that things can always be better.
32:31
Living in Montavilla and I’d go to my dad and I’d say, hey, I was out here
32:35
and this boy called me a name and said aren’t you grateful for Abraham
32:40
Lincoln and that kind of thing.
32:42
My dad would say, it’s okay.
32:45
He said, he doesn’t understand.
32:48
He said, it’s okay.
32:50
We would sit down and he’d talk and he started explaining
32:52
some things to me, you know?
32:55
That’s what it took.
32:56
But they weren’t bitter.
32:57
They
33:01
gave us a different outlook and they stayed spiritual.
33:07
They stayed close to the church
33:12
as far as having faith that things get better.
33:16
My mother’s father’s a revival minister, probably, and he did that
33:22
until he was about 95 years old.
33:26
He was Baptist.
33:28
My dad, I don’t know that he was raised by his grandparents, I don’t know that he was
33:33
religious at all until he got with my mom.
33:36
When they got out here and joined the Black Lutheran church, they came
33:42
together on things and that kind of gelled and they said this needs
33:45
to be part of our life, and it was.
33:50
Not saying they were perfect.
33:51
My dad had worked hard all week and on Saturday nights he might have a good time
33:56
and have some beers and stuff, but Sunday morning we were all in church as a family.
34:01
We went to Sunday school.
34:05
He was one of the officers in the church.
34:07
We counted the money afterward and that’s even going to the White church,
34:12
that every Sunday afternoon counting that money and then rolling the coins
34:18
up and taking it to the bank and putting it in the night drop and stuff.
34:24
They believed that we should stay involved in what’s happening in our lives, that we
34:31
should be part of something, that we don’t just sit back and watch what’s being done.
34:39
I think we just, we followed that lead.
34:42
One important lesson they taught us very young is you need to own property.
34:49
When they bought the little house for $1,500 on Rodney they kept
34:56
that several years as a rental.
34:59
For 3 of us 4 kids, once we were up and bought our own houses
35:04
and stuff, we got into rentals.
35:06
They
35:09
said you work, but you got to have something else.
35:13
Have something else on the side.
35:16
When I met Bob, we came together and we each had a piece of property
35:22
and we said, oh, this is great.
35:25
We need to have a prenuptial agreement so that we know, because we’d been
35:29
married before, nobody should take anything away from anybody else.
35:33
So, we had this prenuptial agreement this attorney wrote up and said when you came
35:37
into it this was his and this was hers.
35:40
Then after 3 or 4 years you throw that stuff away and you
35:43
say, okay, everything’s ours.
35:46
We knew the kids were going to be gone someday, so what we did was every time we
35:52
had an opportunity we picked up something else, and we picked up something else.
35:56
Back then, you could do that because property was cheaper, so much cheaper.
36:00
You know, kids can’t do that these days.
36:02
It’s so hard for them and they have to come back home and that sort of thing.
36:08
We haven’t had that.
36:12
Our kids all, I think, in their 20s bought their own places.
36:20
Now, whether they kept them or whether they married and had something with
36:26
somebody else, maybe they divorced the person and they needed something.
36:33
The concept still flows that you need to have a piece of the rock.
36:37
That’s very important.
36:39
You need to have that to stabilize yourself.
36:43
We carried on that tradition and trying to carry on that philosophy
36:49
with the grandkids and maybe into the great grandkids have an
36:54
opportunity to talk with them.
36:59
Tell a little bit about, then, the neighborhood where you were living,
37:02
or neighborhoods, with your children as they grew up and what was going on
37:09
socially and politically and so on in those neighborhoods and your relations
37:15
to the people, to the neighbors.
37:17
Okay.
37:18
While I was raised in Montavilla, when it was time for me to buy a
37:23
house I came back to inner northeast Portland, mainly because I could get
37:29
more house for the money and I needed to be around people that look like me.
37:36
I didn’t want to be stuck out in neighborhoods.
37:39
So,
37:42
the kids went to the neighborhood schools.
37:50
Because it’s a blended family, kids might be with their other
37:56
parent that sort of thing.
37:58
But mostly everybody was right around pretty close in the same
38:02
area until a couple of children moved with their mom to California.
38:10
But even then, when they graduated from high school, they came
38:12
back and gravitated back here.
38:17
I think
38:21
I’ve always tried to live in a diverse neighborhood.
38:25
I think that’s strong.
38:27
I really like that.
38:28
I also
38:33
from the beginning - we like to know who are neighbors are.
38:36
My parents did that.
38:37
We knew who the neighbors were because the neighborhood kids would come to
38:43
our house and we would go to their houses, if my parents approved of it.
38:50
They wanted to know who they were and what was going on, and that sort of thing.
38:52
I think we kind of instilled that sort of thing.
38:53
It
38:58
wasn’t so much how kids maybe have sleepovers and that kind of thing.
39:03
We pretty much s tuck to home, and our kids did, too.
39:08
We didn’t encourage, because we weren’t in control of somebody else’s house,
39:13
and when you’re not in control of somebody else’s house, you don’t quite
39:16
know what’s going on with your child.
39:19
But, certainly, all the kids were welcome, come over to visit, that sort of thing.
39:26
But we love diverse neighborhoods.
39:31
So, when you say diverse, you mean that it has a good amount of African Americans?
39:38
Mm-hmm, African Americans, Asians, Latino, White, old, young, yeah.
39:50
Tell me a little bit, this is a different subject but you have a big family and
39:56
I know you probably celebrate holidays.
40:00
Tell us a little bit about how you celebrate holidays and which holidays.
40:06
Well, we celebrate birthdays but we have to do it in chunks.
40:10
We’re so big [laughs that we never get everybody together, so we just had a
40:20
celebration for our wedding anniversary.
40:23
At that point, we probably had a dozen of us together.
40:28
We had another celebration in the summer, and well, no, even before that
40:34
we went to a Moroccan restaurant and that was for son’s birthday, and there was
40:41
probably about 12, 12 or 15 people there.
40:48
Because it’s a blended family and because there’s different dynamics going on
40:54
with other parents and things, you see,
40:59
we love all the kids and we try to be very diplomatic in what we’re doing.
41:06
We’re thinking because we’re going to hit a milestone next month.
41:13
I’ll be 70 and he’ll be 80, trying to think, okay, now
41:18
what’s this going to look like?
41:19
My daughter was calling us last night saying, l think what we
41:23
should do and I says, okay.
41:26
Give us a few days to think about it first.
41:29
Because we have to figure out the dynamics of all this is going to work out okay.
41:33
But, it’s fun.
41:35
We try to get together always for Thanksgiving and for Christmas.
41:41
We just, we can’t hit everybody’s birthday.
41:44
We can’t hit everybody’s whatever celebration.
41:47
We had a grandson that graduated from Wilsonville High this summer.
41:53
We went down to, and so happy.
41:55
He’s in Clackamas Community College now and stuff.
42:00
The kids are growing, but the majority are in the Portland metro area, which is nice.
42:06
It’s really nice.
42:08
When you celebrate, say, for Christmas, kids, or whichever
42:14
parts of the family come here?
42:18
Have dinner?
42:18
What do you do?
42:19
We used to, but now a couple of the kids have bigger houses than we have.
42:25
We’ll go over to the bigger houses where more people can get in or
42:29
maybe they can float together on different levels of the house.
42:34
My husband has a museum in the basement.
42:38
He’s very particular about these 10,000 books and all these pictures
42:44
and that kind of thing that he doesn’t want necessarily the great grandkids
42:48
running through, that sort of thing.
42:51
Sometimes, it’s kind of a neutral place that we’ll go to.
42:56
But, we’ll cook and take things there.
42:58
What do you take?
42:59
What do you cook?
43:00
Well, let’s see.
43:04
You know I like to bake.
43:06
So, usually I’ll take my sweet potato pies or cobblers and that sort of thing.
43:14
Some of the other kids are good on the meats and the veggies and people
43:19
are trying to be healthy now, so we’ll trying all kind of vegan dishes.
43:23
We’re open for it.
43:25
We just want to be healthy.
43:27
We want to live as long as we can, live our best life.
43:36
We change traditions as times change.
43:41
Absolutely, and both my folks lived to be almost 90.
43:45
They went with the flow.
43:46
It was really good.
43:49
They were always lifelong learners so they could adapt and be flexible at
43:54
every age, and that’s what we try to do.
44:02
You were talking about a certain amount of your jobs, so I think we
44:07
got up to you working for the union.
44:12
Mm-hmm.
44:13
I worked for the union, and that lasted about 5 years.
44:19
One of our presidents, Reagan in fact, when he was elected that was a challenge
44:25
when it broke up one of the unions—PATCO, the air traffic controllers, and other
44:31
unions took a hit as well as the AFL-CIO.
44:35
Because I had worked for them, they had to close 5 or 6 offices
44:39
nationwide, and I got hit in that.
44:44
So, from there was the beginning of me really working for non-profits.
44:48
About half my career I worked in non-profits.
44:51
I also worked for a while, several years, for Gladys McCoy on her executive
44:58
staff when she was the county chair of Multnomah County, the only African
45:03
American county chair we’ve had.
45:06
She was a wonderful person to work
45:11
for.
45:11
From there, I’ve had other political jobs, but non-profits, non-profits, I—
45:17
Which non-profits?
45:18
Okay.
45:20
I worked for an organization called the Center for Urban Education.
45:24
What we focused on actually was probably giving one day or two day classes to
45:31
people who are working folks on grant writing and how to be a successful manager
45:37
and the basics of successful supervision, all kinds of things as well as they got
45:44
into some community and national issues.
45:50
I can remember one time that they had the, we had papers from the
45:57
federal government to take to Grand Ronde, because they were getting
46:03
reestablished as a tribe out there, and that’s before the casino or any of that.
46:08
They just had a little post office and different things.
46:11
But we did very interesting things.
46:13
I was with them for about 5 years and from there I went to work for Gladys McCoy.
46:19
I’ve worked for
46:24
probably employment and training in that arena wherever I’ve been.
46:30
I think the most fun job I’ve had, I used to, I would run
46:34
temporary employment agencies.
46:36
I was with NA Rail, which is a national agency, and I was with St. Vincent
46:42
de Paul that specializes in putting people with disability on jobs, you
46:47
know people that never had to come out of their house because they’re on
46:50
social security disability, but their integrity made them want to feel like
46:55
they wanted to come out and be useful.
47:00
Tell about that.
47:00
Give us some of your experiences.
47:03
Well, you know when you go into employment and training, you need to have the
47:12
understanding of who’s out there.
47:16
So, working for NA Rail, they trained us very well.
47:19
They’re national office was in Atlanta, and it’s sales, but it’s also getting
47:27
people hired and so would interview hundreds of people and you had to
47:34
have that gut feeling that you can put this person on a job and that
47:40
they would stay committed to that job whether it was a one-week, a
47:45
one-month, or a three-month assignment.
47:48
I helped a lot of people get started on jobs that way, especially women
47:52
coming back into the workforce whose kids had gone, they were in school now.
48:00
It’d give people the courage, oh I’m not into computers, I don’t know how to—oh
48:05
yeah, this is easier, if you ever had to go in and use the old typewriters,
48:11
this is going to be a piece of cake for you because these things do everything.
48:16
Anyway, that was, I loved those jobs because you can inspire people to
48:24
get started on a new path, a new track, give them the confidence
48:30
that they needed in themselves.
48:31
I had one woman who had been a server for 20 years.
48:35
She said, I just can’t do this anymore.
48:37
I need to do something else.
48:39
I said, well, come on in.
48:40
Let’s see.
48:42
So, I told her about a couple of opportunities when I saw she really
48:45
wanted to get into computers.
48:46
She took a class, a coupled classes at PCC and came back in.
48:51
By then, she knew the keyboard and she could do a few things.
48:57
But she’s so committed.
48:59
Being a server she was so committed on a job, and put her on a couple assignments
49:04
and everybody loved her because she had good interpersonal skills, she could
49:09
get along with folks, and she wasn’t a know-it-all, she would ask how to
49:17
do it and if she was doing it right.
49:20
Everybody that had her and she’d be on assignments for more than a
49:24
year, they didn’t want to let her go.
49:27
It changes your life.
49:27
What are some
49:33
of the other examples from some of the other NGOs that you worked for?
49:41
Actually, you know,
49:46
I had a life-changing even when my mom died.
49:50
My dad died in ’95, and we had my mom here in the house with us for 8 years.
49:56
When she passed, I’ll tell you it was like you know, I was kind of failing.
50:02
My husband went to the doctor, he said, my wife’s not doing good.
50:05
Because when you live with a person, you do everything for them.
50:09
You know, every time you get in the car you’re with them and that sort of thing.
50:15
So, between and my doctor and my daughter, specifically my daughter,
50:22
she said, hey mom why don’t you go back and finish the college you
50:25
said you never got a chance to do?
50:28
So, within a 2-week period I decided and signed up to go.
50:35
I started with PCC
50:38
and I went there for 2 years and then I transferred to Concordia University
50:43
and I completed my business degree.
50:46
It was one of the best things I ever did in my life.
50:49
So, how old were you at that time?
50:51
I was 55 when I started and I finished at, I was almost 59 when I graduated.
51:00
I graduated winter term.
51:02
The kids and the grandkids were there for the celebration and the Concordia
51:08
president, he had Bob come up on the stage and hand me my degree.
51:14
It was just absolutely wonderful.
51:17
I always wanted to do it and on every job you’re on they’ll give you training.
51:22
You’re sent to seminars.
51:24
You’re sent to training that sort of thing, but I never
51:26
had it tied all together.
51:29
This is an opportunity.
51:30
So, I went in the summer.
51:32
I never stopped.
51:33
I went every single term, because I knew if I stopped I wouldn’t
51:37
go back, so I had to keep going.
51:40
That was absolutely wonderful.
51:42
I have so many young friends.
51:44
I learned about, I had little study groups.
51:48
I learned a lot about the computer.
51:50
I can do research on the computer.
51:53
I just, there’s just so much, it just opened up a whole new world to me.
51:58
After I got through I signed up to be an AmeriCorps Volunteer.
52:02
I did that for a year at the Native American Center right
52:06
down here on Columbia Boulevard.
52:08
I helped their employment and training.
52:10
That was my background, anyway.
52:12
I helped their employment and training department when
52:14
I was down there for a year.
52:16
That kind of validated what I was doing.
52:22
That’s very, very, very interesting.
52:29
It validated what you were doing and did it give you more confidence?
52:33
Or that was never a problem?
52:35
It did.
52:36
Because I will tell you, especially in some of the jobs, like working for the
52:41
county or working for the city, I always worked with people that had these degrees.
52:47
I always felt like I had to work longer and harder to match up,
52:52
although people around me all thought that I had the degree.
52:57
When you work on jobs side by side, they don’t ask you, but they
53:00
took it for granted that I did.
53:02
I knew that I didn’t.
53:04
Once I got the degree, it did build the confidence level
53:11
that I’d always wanted to have.
53:16
I’m going to go back now to
53:22
another kind of subject, but tell us a little bit more about your social
53:26
life, what kind of friends you have, what you like to do for entertainment
53:31
or the kind of relationships you have with different people?
53:36
Okay.
53:38
Well, there’s 3 areas
53:44
that I focus on.
53:45
Of course, family but also
53:52
I was introduced to a senior group, the north northeast has an AARP chapter.
54:00
It’s mostly African American.
54:03
It
54:05
has a continuous charter for the last 20 years in this neighborhood.
54:13
My husband had been going while I was still working full-time.
54:17
When I stopped working, he said why don’t you come to a meeting with me?
54:24
So, I went to a meeting and they were having it in one of the senior
54:28
housing projects here, and about 35 people and they were there in the
54:36
middle of the day and I walked in and the president said, hey Bob, who’s
54:42
this young girl you brought in here?
54:44
[Laughs] And my head turned, I said, I haven’t been called that in a long time.
54:51
I said this is my kind of group.
54:55
I never stopped.
54:55
That’s been about 9 years that I’ve been part of this AARP.
55:01
I’m president of that chapter now, and just completing my second term,
55:08
second 2-year term as president.
55:13
What has happened, I’ve met a lot of people I didn’t know.
55:23
The chapter’s made up of a lot of movers and shakers that have done
55:28
wonderful things in this city.
55:30
That have integrated places.
55:32
They have been entrepreneurs.
55:35
They are retired educators.
55:37
They are retired health professionals from every walk of life.
55:42
But when you listen to them and the challenges they have had
55:46
in their life and they’ve been through a little bit of everything,
55:49
and they have still persevered.
55:51
Our most active group within our chapter is the ages of 75 to 85.
55:58
Our youngest member is 54, and we acknowledge 3 of our
56:03
oldest members at 90 this year.
56:07
You know, and people who still want to come out who still want to be
56:11
knowledgeable of things that are changing.
56:16
That group of seniors, I also teach Sunday school, middle school and high
56:21
school, but I also with little kids trying to tutor little kids over here at this
56:28
Faubion school for about 5 years, because I worked for an organization called
56:36
Reading Results and the statistics would show you if a child can read by the 3rd
56:45
grade, if they can really read by the 3rd grade, it’s very likely that they
56:53
are going to graduate from high school.
56:56
So, I worked over here for 5 years with Reading Results, where we
57:00
would design custom reading plans.
57:03
It was a nonprofit that paid us to do this, but so meaningful and they’re
57:11
in all kind of school districts now.
57:14
They have a lot of volunteers.
57:15
I stepped back a couple of years ago and I said, okay.
57:21
Okay.
57:23
But we like to, Bob and I like music.
57:26
We used to like to dance a lot.
57:28
We dance at home now with our Bose system [laughs]
57:34
. We have friends that we associate with.
57:37
We have a couple of groups that we’ll go down, probably
57:41
on the party bus to a casino.
57:44
We have a favorite New Year’s Eve party we go to each year.
57:48
You know, we try to stay as active as possible.
57:53
Give me some descriptions of some of your social outings.
58:01
Take some example of one or two.
58:03
Okay, yeah.
58:04
The historical society, we love to go through the exhibits
58:07
at the historical society.
58:09
They have a really good one right now on Blacks that were involved in World War II.
58:14
We like to go down there because history’s a thing for both of us.
58:17
We think that’s so important so that you can pass on to your kids.
58:21
When they had the Civil Rights exhibit down at the historical society, and
58:26
our kids went down there and saw our pictures up there, they said, really?
58:32
[Laughs] I said, we tried to tell you we did a few things, but you know people
58:37
get so busy with their lives and stuff.
58:41
We like to go to plays, musical concerts.
58:45
We just went to the O’Jays at Spirit Mountain Casino and jumped up and danced
58:51
to their music and stuff, you know.
58:53
We like all of that.
58:55
I’m trying to get into hearing some of the stuff that the kids are doing these days
59:01
if we can understand what they’re doing.
59:05
There’s still some artists, like India Arie, some of them that we really,
59:10
really like that are pretty thoughtful.
59:13
Who are your very favorites?
59:17
Oh, you know then, it would go back to the R&B days where we had Gladys
59:23
Knight, Marvin Gaye, when we had, you know, the Temptations, the Four
59:29
Tops, we had Diana Ross and Dionne Warwick and just Harold Melvin & the
59:40
Blue Notes, just so many, so many.
59:42
We still have vinyl.
59:44
Now, I have my selection of vinyl up here, okay?
59:47
But I can’t touch his selection downstairs, okay?
59:50
He’s got vinyl.
59:51
I’ve got vinyl, and then we have some DVDs and stuff that we play, but we like vinyl.
59:58
Yeah.
59:58
I understand that’s kind of making a comeback.
1:00:01
It is.
1:00:03
We’ll talk later.
1:00:07
[Laughs]
1:00:09
. Yeah, so you guys have a, maintain a nice, active life.
1:00:17
Let’s go int a little bit deeper about what you yourself actually
1:00:22
did during the Civil Rights.
1:00:26
Okay, well, okay, so the years.
1:00:31
Okay, so you want to talk about ‘60s?
1:00:35
‘70s?
1:00:36
Yep.
1:00:37
Okay.
1:00:39
I,
1:00:42
first let me say my folks from where they came from understood how
1:00:46
important it was to stay involved.
1:00:49
As a kid, what I can remember is coming to churches, even though we
1:00:53
lived in Montavilla, we came over here and I can remember going to
1:00:57
the basement meetings of churches.
1:00:59
It must have been like NAACP meetings or something like that, because I can just
1:01:04
remember us being in groups of people.
1:01:07
You would have been how old in the ‘60s?
1:01:10
I would have been... yeah, I graduated from high school in ’67, so this
1:01:16
would have been like ’61, you know?
1:01:17
’60, ’59.
1:01:17
Fourteen, something like
1:01:26
that.
1:01:27
I remember
1:01:31
when we had, well, yeah.
1:01:36
I got involved probably right after high school.
1:01:40
The Black Power movement was going on.
1:01:43
The Black Panthers.
1:01:44
Tell us about the Black Panthers.
1:01:48
I wasn’t so much involved here, but we did, and before I met Bob.
1:01:56
But I did visit the Panther headquarters in Seattle, and I had a couple of
1:02:03
friends that were involved up there
1:02:08
and went to the headquarters and I can just remember them saying, well,
1:02:12
you know you got your car out there.
1:02:14
You know, the FBI, the CIA, whatever they got your license plate number.
1:02:19
You’re on the rolls now.
1:02:20
I said, okay.
1:02:22
To go in and see the sandbags set up all around the windows and stuff.
1:02:29
Here, they had kids with library books and they had free lunch.
1:02:35
People forget that the Panthers started the free lunch.
1:02:40
Made all the sense.
1:02:41
Feed the body and the mind can learn.
1:02:47
I can remember
1:02:50
participating.
1:02:52
I can remember getting involved when Angela Davis, when all that happened,
1:03:01
and I was just so thirsty for all that knowledge and reading the books and
1:03:10
trying to work with other groups that were involved in that.
1:03:16
I was working full-time, and didn’t have my daughter then.
1:03:24
So, I had more freedom to do stuff, but, mostly, mine was just filling that void
1:03:32
that I didn’t know a lot that went on.
1:03:34
We didn’t have social media.
1:03:36
Had no idea like the kids now.
1:03:39
They’re smarter.
1:03:40
I
1:03:43
was just filling that void and getting myself knowledgeable as
1:03:47
possible with what was going on.
1:03:55
What did you think about the differences of the approach in NAACP,
1:04:01
Blank Panthers, Martin Luther King?
1:04:04
There were all those different approaches at the time.
1:04:10
[Takes deep breath] I was not a supporter of King because I felt he was too passive.
1:04:17
Malcom X, I listened to, and I listened to the smart, educated
1:04:26
people within the Panthers.
1:04:28
I grew up watching Huntley-Brinkley on TV.
1:04:33
As a family, we used to sit down after dinner and watch the news
1:04:39
and to see the hoses and the dogs set on people in the south.
1:04:44
It just went all through me.
1:04:48
I just thought that King was too passive, non-violence, you know.
1:04:56
But like I say, I mean I was of the age.
1:04:59
I was young.
1:05:01
I wanted more action.
1:05:04
I wanted to see that we were actually fighting back, really
1:05:08
resisting what was happening.
1:05:11
It took years for me to understand King.
1:05:16
Absolute years, but when I was in college I wrote a paper which
1:05:21
they published over in India
1:05:26
for one of my classes.
1:05:28
It was the history of India I was taking.
1:05:32
It was two comparisons between Gandhi and Ambedkar, who was who
1:05:39
a lot of the Indian people respect because he was an untouchable.
1:05:43
He wasn’t born in the higher class like Gandhi, and compare that to Martin Luther
1:05:49
King and Malcom X, Malcom X who had a very poor upcoming and King who was in
1:05:55
the echelon, upper echelon class, and just talking about how you raise leaders up
1:06:03
with what philosophies and if one has had the advantage and the other has had none.
1:06:12
Something about my instructor, over there at Concordia, he said, Judy,
1:06:17
I’ve never seen this done before.
1:06:19
Do you mind if I send this to my friend in India?
1:06:22
I said, no [laughs] . It was an article, it was a paper maybe,
1:06:28
I don’t know, probably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 pages long or something.
1:06:34
Well, his wife, the Indian man’s wife had died and he was trying to put together
1:06:40
some essays that were a tribute for his wife and things that she believed in.
1:06:46
He asked could he put this in the book.
1:06:48
I said, what a compliment.
1:06:51
Yeah.
1:06:52
Congratulations.
1:06:52
I know!
1:06:53
I know [laughs]
1:07:10
. Well, I think we’ve come kind of towards the end and I’ll ask you
1:07:15
some of these more ending questions.
1:07:23
What were some of the best parts and those that weren’t so good in your life?
1:07:32
Well, for sure the best part would have been the birth of my
1:07:38
daughter, because for a long time I contemplated whether I wanted to
1:07:41
bring a child into this world when I saw the problems and things going on.
1:07:49
She’s
1:07:51
really been just such a strong supporter, such a strong woman now.
1:08:00
How old is she now?
1:08:01
She’s 44.
1:08:04
We’re really very, very good friends.
1:08:08
She met Bob when she was 3.
1:08:12
That’s how long she’s been around with him.
1:08:16
For sure, Bob and I have made a good team.
1:08:19
I had a previous marriage, and not that anything bad happened
1:08:24
but sometimes when you get married so young, and I was 18 when I got
1:08:28
married, you just kind of grow apart.
1:08:31
You’re growing up in the midst of that.
1:08:39
Bob and I have been a good team and good support for all of the children.
1:08:45
I think that the,
1:08:50
I really miss my parents because they were so supportive.
1:08:55
I’m
1:08:59
the only one of the siblings left, so they’re gone.
1:09:07
I think that’s hard.
1:09:12
You don’t look at those things in life, you don’t appreciate
1:09:15
what you have when you have it.
1:09:19
But all in all, I think we push past, we persevere, and we
1:09:25
take advantage of what we can.
1:09:27
This life is just a blink of an eye.
1:09:32
We have faith
1:09:35
that this isn’t all there is, but you have to have comparisons and you
1:09:42
have to have, know the hard times to know the good times and vice versa.
1:09:53
I will say my life was full of a lot of people and specifically a lot of people
1:10:00
and now this older group that I’m in.
1:10:03
I’ve seen them go through sickness and death and tragedies and all kinds
1:10:09
of things, and you know they’re like my old boss, Gladys McCoy, the county
1:10:14
chair, she said, this too shall pass.
1:10:17
She had 7 children, and 2 had juvenile diabetes and you know,
1:10:25
you
1:10:28
learn to just take one day and enjoy that day, so that’s where I am.
1:10:39
What would you have done differently in your life if you were able to?
1:10:45
Probably start traveling a lot earlier.
1:10:49
I truly think that’d the education.
1:10:51
I would.
1:10:53
I would have just, you know, have just saved enough money just
1:10:58
to be able to go all the time.
1:11:00
I met a friend that that’s what he does.
1:11:04
He works for 6 to 9 months, make enough money, and then he’s off.
1:11:09
He travels, and then he writes about the travels and then he
1:11:12
writes about the travels and he sends it back to us so we can read.
1:11:14
I said, this is fantastic.
1:11:16
That is the only way that you have a true understanding and appreciation for other
1:11:26
folks, or, to appreciate what we have as opposed to what other people don’t have.
1:11:35
But, travel’s a key.
1:11:36
For the very last question, when
1:11:42
you look back at your life what stands out the most in your memory?
1:11:57
Hmm.
1:11:59
I guess the importance of family.
1:12:06
You know, I know people that have no one.
1:12:12
I’ve gone through a lot of hurtles and you could, family’s there to catch you.
1:12:19
I think the importance of family, and close friends.
1:12:24
They keep you out of insane asylums [laughs]
1:12:33
. Okay is there anything else you would like to add to let
1:12:36
us know more about your life?
1:12:40
No.
1:12:41
You
1:12:45
know, it’s very interesting to be born in Portland, Oregon, to have seen changes.
1:12:52
I
1:12:55
think one of my biggest disappointments right today is that we feel like we have
1:13:04
to go back out to the streets to fight the things that we fought so many years ago.
1:13:08
I am just so disappointed, so embarrassed, by this government and what’s happening
1:13:16
at the executive level that I’m ashamed to travel and say I’m American.
1:13:24
I mean, there is no need for what’s going on now and it takes a lot
1:13:31
of brave people to change things around, and we’re working so hard to
1:13:38
make that change happen next year.
1:13:40
We’re working so hard, but I didn’t think at almost 70 years old that I’d
1:13:48
be wanting to be back in the streets where I was when I was in my 20s.
1:13:53
Never would have conceived that anything would be threatened
1:13:57
like it was threatened before.
1:14:02
Yes.
1:14:07
Greg, did you have any questions?
1:14:08
No questions.
1:14:15
Well, thank you.
1:14:16
Thank you.
1:14:17
Very much.
1:14:17
Thank you.
