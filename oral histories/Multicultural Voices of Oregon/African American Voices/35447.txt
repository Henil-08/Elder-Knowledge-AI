00:01
Well, let’s start out with you telling us a little bit about the history of
00:06
your childhood, start out with, tell us a little bit about the history
00:12
of your family first, because I know you’ve got a long history in Portland.
00:18
I do.
00:19
Okay, well, I was born and raised here in Portland, Oregon.
00:24
My parents migrated up here from St. Louis, Missouri.
00:28
I wasn’t even born yet.
00:29
They came up here to work in the shipyards.
00:32
They
00:35
came up in 1943, so I was born 2 years later, 1945.
00:42
Growing up, we lived in St. John’s Woods, which is where they had, I guess
00:49
it was an old Army barracks out there.
00:52
So, I guess after the Army left they opened it up so people were
00:55
able to live in those houses.
00:58
I grew up there.
01:00
I had so much fun, all the Pier Park, all the trees.
01:04
It was just beautiful.
01:05
I went to Sitton Grade School.
01:09
I think I was in kindergarten, and I went there and one of the
01:13
most significant things that I can remember is we used to do the Maypole,
01:19
and I wish they still did that.
01:21
They don’t do it anymore, and it was so wonderful.
01:26
My mom bought me this beautiful white dress which had all of
01:30
these flurry things on it.
01:32
I had the white socks with the little ruffles around it, the
01:36
black patent leather shoes.
01:38
I thought that was so cute, and my hair was in Shirley Temple curls.
01:42
It was really a wonderful time in doing the Maypole dancing.
01:48
Just growing up and I had my first cousin and I, we both grew up together.
01:54
I was just like a year, 18 months older than her.
01:58
We grew up together.
01:59
Played a lot.
02:01
Had lots of fun.
02:02
Our parents, they would send us, I remember they would
02:07
send us to church on Sunday.
02:09
They would send us to church on the apostolic
02:14
faith bus.
02:16
It would come around in the neighborhood and pick up children
02:20
or parents, whoever wanted to go.
02:22
They would send us to church, and then they would go to Henry Winery.
02:29
The only reason why we knew that they had went to Henry Winery is
02:33
because when they came back they would have these big jugs of wine.
02:38
Henry Winery was somewhere,
02:42
I guess it was out quite a ways.
02:44
I’m not sure.
02:45
I don’t remember because I was young.
02:47
I just knew it was a fun time for them.
02:51
We always had a lot of fun.
02:52
There was always a lot of dancing,
02:58
wrestling with uncles, and just a fun time for all of us.
03:02
Growing up was, it was really a lot of fun for me and my family.
03:07
There were some other things that went on, but for the most part it was pretty good.
03:11
Tell us a little bit about the other things that went on.
03:12
Yeah [laughs] . That’s true.
03:12
Just paint a complete, realistic picture.
03:12
Yeah.
03:12
What were some of those things?
03:24
Well,
03:27
some things happened.
03:29
My grandmother,
03:33
granny, her name was Willa May, and that was my father’s mother.
03:38
So, I always wanted to stay with them because my grandmother’s
03:42
hair was like yours, but hers was all the way down to her bottom.
03:45
I was about 5, I remember this specifically because I would
03:50
love, I would ask her could I just brush her hair or either comb it.
03:54
She would just sit there and I would just comb it and brush it for
03:58
maybe, it seemed like a long time.
04:00
It probably was only 15, 20 minutes, if it was that long, but it seemed like a really
04:06
long time to me, but I really loved her.
04:08
She was really just a neat lady.
04:12
She had fruit trees in her yard, and she stayed right at, her home was right
04:18
across the street from Boise-Eliot School.
04:23
She lived on Borthwick and Fremont, and so she had, and she, her garden
04:30
was always so beautiful, all kinds of flowers and she would let me help.
04:36
I thought I was helping.
04:37
I probably was not helping that much, I was only 5.
04:41
I remember being out in the garden with her, and then going in the other side, the
04:47
front yard was where all the flowers were.
04:48
Then on the side of the house, that’s where her pear trees were.
04:52
She had the best pears.
04:55
I can just still remember them now.
04:57
They were so juicy and so sweet and I only, because she told me I could
05:03
only have one or two, no more than that because they were juicy and then
05:07
sometimes you eat too much sweet stuff like that it’d make your stomach hurt.
05:11
I would just—oh, my gosh, the memories I have of that.
05:15
She was a really, really cool lady.
05:19
Granny was sweet.
05:22
My other grandmother, my mom’s mom,
05:26
she was traumatized when she was a young girl.
05:31
She saw some devastating things that we didn’t find out until I was an adult.
05:37
All of us, we didn’t know that my grandmother, my mother’s mom, that she had
05:42
saw her dad, one of her brothers, and an uncle, they were hung where they were at.
05:51
We always thought that my grandmother, my mother’s mother, that she was from
05:55
St. Louis, Missouri, but she was not.
05:57
She was born in Mississippi, the really, I guess, Deep South.
06:02
So, she saw this, but then she probably had PTSD, but they didn’t
06:06
know anything about that back then.
06:11
My grandmother was really different, my mother’s mom, really different
06:17
and she had—we knew something was wrong because she was kind of mean.
06:23
I
06:26
really didn’t like her that much.
06:28
I had to stay with her when my mom had married again and she
06:36
lived up in Bridal Veil, Oregon.
06:37
My mother was a professional cook and a professional baker.
06:41
My brother and I, we lived with my grandmother.
06:46
There were some different things, like I said, that went on.
06:49
I don’t know exactly what it was, but it kind of shaped me as I became older
06:54
because my grandmother was, she was pretty tough, and like I said, pretty mean.
06:58
As we got older, though, she kind of mellowed out.
07:02
But basically, in the summer my brother and I we’d get to go to
07:07
Bridal Veil, Oregon, where my mother and my stepdad was at.
07:10
They worked on a mink farm.
07:13
It was just so cool because for the whole summer we got to stay up there
07:18
and we would get in the boat because where they lived at in that particular
07:25
place, the people had, I guess it was a man-made lake, so they had boats, the
07:31
little paddle boats, they had those on.
07:33
So, I remember this, I was 9 and my brother was 7, and we went out, the little
07:40
boy, his name was David, I remember him.
07:43
He was Caucasian.
07:45
So, we went, he took me out in the paddle boat and he said, that
07:48
was my first kiss from a boy.
07:52
He says, you give me a kiss.
07:54
I’m not going to take you back, because I couldn’t swim.
07:57
I’m not going to take you back, so I did.
07:59
We just did this little lip thing or whatever.
08:02
That was a lot of fun.
08:03
That was my, some of my favorite times was going up there in the summer and
08:08
just being with my mom and stepdad.
08:10
That
08:12
was really good.
08:13
Basically, I guess for some people, I mean some of the things did happen.
08:19
I guess it wasn’t all that good, but I think it really helped and shaped
08:22
me to become the person that I am now.
08:27
My childhood was, I guess, basically a mixture of everything, you know—some
08:31
things that were helpful, some things that were not, and basically good.
08:36
Can you tell us a little bit more about those things that were not so
08:42
helpful and things that happened that were—
08:42
There were some things that happened to me sexually that were not okay.
08:48
So, it gave me, because I was really young, so it just gave me a different
08:54
perspective about men and how they’re really supposed to treat you.
09:00
I didn’t feel, at that time, that anybody was there to protect
09:04
me, so I felt like I had been abandoned when this happened to me.
09:09
Something happened when I was about 5.
09:11
I was almost 6.
09:14
So, it just, like I said, it shaped who I was going to
09:18
become as a teenager, an adult.
09:22
In what ways?
09:26
Well, it changed my thinking about men.
09:31
For me, as I grew up as, you know, a young adult, got married really early, and I
09:38
chose the wrong kind of guys to be with.
09:42
So, I liked these bad boy type, and I really did.
09:47
I loved the bad boy type.
09:49
That kind of thing.
09:51
So, I ended up with my first husband, I ended up with somebody, he was violent.
09:59
I didn’t know this because we grew up together as kids
10:03
when we lived in St. John’s.
10:04
So, he was just a kid.
10:06
The next time, because we finally moved from out there.
10:09
When we moved, and then I’ll get back to the unhealthy thing, but when we
10:14
moved I didn’t see him for some years.
10:16
I didn’t see him—we moved when I was about 8 because I ended up going to
10:20
Immaculate Heart Catholic School there.
10:23
My mother wanted me in a parochial school, somewhere where she
10:26
thought I would learn better.
10:28
During that time, you had to take all these IQ tests before you could get into
10:34
the Catholic school, especially if you didn’t have the money available to pay.
10:38
I passed all of their tests that they put me through, so my mom
10:43
was able to get the scholarship for me to go to Immaculate Heart.
10:48
That was good because the nuns really helped me.
10:50
Back then, even though I must have been only about 8, I had a really bad mouth.
10:56
I mean, people say potty mouth.
10:57
My mouth was probably worse than potty, but that was because, I really
11:03
figured out later that it was because of things that had happened to me,
11:05
so I had a lot of anger inside that I really didn’t know how to deal with.
11:13
That shaped me, too.
11:14
But the nuns were, they were kind of mean.
11:18
They were, I shouldn’t say kind of—they were mean.
11:20
They would take you by your ear and take you in the bathroom and
11:26
put that, ugh, nasty, like boric soap was going to help me not cuss.
11:33
That wasn’t going to do anything, so I would spit it everywhere.
11:36
It was interesting at the Immaculate Heart School.
11:43
Then back, like I said, the thing that happened to me when I was a little
11:46
over 5 years old it really shaped the way I dealt with men, women.
11:55
I didn’t have a lot of women friends as I got older.
11:59
I didn’t because I really didn’t trust them, and I don’t know if it was because
12:05
I felt like I was untrustworthy or what.
12:07
I had all these different emotions, and I all stemmed it back to
12:11
what happened to me as a child, and it happened more than once.
12:16
It happened twice.
12:18
Once, with this person that when I was about 5—I can’t
12:22
remember the person’s face.
12:24
I just, for some reason, it just won’t come up in my brain.
12:27
I don’t know.
12:28
Maybe it’s a blessing that I don’t know.
12:31
The second time that it actually happened it was my mom’s boyfriend,
12:37
and it just almost ruined my insides.
12:40
The doctors told my mom that I would never be able to have children—ha!
12:44
Ha!
12:44
Would you like to see me now?
12:46
Eight pregnancies, but you know, all of those different things shaped me
12:51
and helped me to really start looking inside of myself and thinking about
12:58
what do you want to do with your life?
13:01
I started asking myself questions, because I had, after the first marriage, like I
13:06
said, it only lasted for about 10 years on paper but for 5 years we kind of
13:11
lived together but there was always this fighting and all this, because he, my
13:16
first husband, he went through a lot, too.
13:18
His dad had told him when we got married, just keep her barefoot and pregnant.
13:22
I just said, after 3 babies, I said I’m not having any more kids by this man
13:26
because I’m always fighting for my life.
13:29
It got to the point where he became a heroin addict.
13:33
That just started everything going downhill.
13:38
I mean, it wasn’t that good anyway, but it just, it went all downhill.
13:46
He was so smart.
13:47
He was such a smart young man.
13:49
He had so much potential.
13:53
He got caught up back in the, I guess it was a, what, late ‘60s,
13:58
early ‘70s Robitussin came in.
14:03
A lot of, I don’t know about, you know, Caucasian men, but a lot of Black
14:09
men, they started drinking that stuff.
14:11
They were selling it at the Rexall drug stores and I mean, they would be—I
14:16
have an uncle, God rest his soul, I had never seen—we called it coasting.
14:22
He would drink 2 or 3 bottles of that stuff.
14:25
I never knew that anybody’s body could bend in as many directions as his did.
14:31
I mean, because it was just fun to watch him, because I had no idea,
14:37
you know, that it was something that was actually hurting his body.
14:40
It was just funny to watch him coast, as we said.
14:45
That era—it was just really different.
14:50
My first husband, we just didn’t last very long.
14:52
Then I ended up,
14:57
I had a baby in between.
14:58
I had this relationship with this guy, ended up getting pregnant,
15:03
ended up having an abortion.
15:06
[Break in recording]
15:06
Okay, so, my ex-husband, really, we went through a lot of the
15:11
different trials and tribulations.
15:13
One of the worst experiences that I remember having with him is he had
15:19
been out I think most of the night.
15:22
He was doing, I think its coke and heroin, and they called it speedballing back then.
15:33
I was asleep.
15:34
The kids were asleep.
15:36
When I woke up I had a .38 pointing right in the middle of my forehead.
15:42
I’m like—oh, my God.
15:45
This man has lost his mind.
15:48
He wanted money.
15:49
I didn’t have any money.
15:51
So, I had this, on the right of me, on the nightstand was a blue, one of those,
15:59
the rotary dial phones, you know the old?
16:01
You know they were really heavy.
16:04
The only thing I could think of was to protect myself.
16:07
If you’re going to blow my brains out, he’s going to have a headache, too.
16:10
I just reached over and did it real quick.
16:12
I hit him so hard, I know I didn’t hit in the name of the Lord.
16:14
I hit him in the name of something else right then, but I hit him so hard.
16:19
It was enough for the gun to drop and then for me to be able to run.
16:24
He was on that, so I didn’t know exactly what all was going
16:29
on in his mind from the gun.
16:30
I just figured, okay, I don’t have any money so maybe he’s
16:34
going to try to kill me.
16:35
I need to get out of here.
16:37
I couldn’t take my kids.
16:38
I just kind of knew in my heart that he wasn’t going to really do
16:40
anything to the kids, because he, for some reason he wanted to hurt me.
16:44
So, I ran outside just with my bra and panties on.
16:48
Thank God that’s what I would sleep in, so I was able to get out of the house.
16:52
I went over to a neighbor’s and so they kept me in there.
16:57
We had a lot of different trials with guns and that kind of stuff.
17:02
I had to escape another time and I was staying with another
17:06
friend and he came out.
17:10
He was out there with a 16-gauge shotgun sitting under the tree.
17:14
How he found out I was at my friend’s house, I don’t know.
17:17
People talk and so that’s probably how he found out.
17:21
He waited for me.
17:22
I was there for about 3 days and he waited.
17:27
Finally, they did call the police.
17:29
Because they were really killing a lot of us, even back then in the
17:33
early ‘70s and that kind of thing.
17:35
So, it was really bad.
17:36
They didn’t want to call the police on him, but they finally
17:39
had to because he wasn’t going to leave and that was real scary.
17:44
All those different things, like I said, continued to shape me and the
17:48
way I thought and the way I reacted to men and to women and other people,
17:53
because basically I was so angry inside.
17:56
Another thing I found out about myself is I was real fearful because I
18:03
forgot as we were growing up my mother used to watch a lot of scary movies.
18:09
I don’t like scary movies at all, anything where there’s lots of blood
18:14
and gore and hurting people and tearing people apart—I just didn’t like that.
18:18
My mom, she could watch all that kind of stuff.
18:20
She watched the exorcist.
18:21
I went to see the exorcist, and they said it was a true story so I
18:25
don’t know, but I went to see it.
18:27
I wish I hadn’t went to see it because all I thought about was my bed raising
18:31
up and the devil being somewhere around there trying to kill—I mean, because I
18:35
just have this, that’s part of why I work well with children because I have this
18:38
real vivid imagination of everything.
18:41
I take it to levels that most people probably don’t, but then how do I know?
18:45
I don’t know what other people are thinking in
18:50
their heads.
18:50
It was different.
18:55
Another thing, after I went through all these different things and
18:58
I finally divorced him, my first husband, he went to the penitentiary.
19:03
I was able to divorce him for
19:07
$1.
19:07
This is what happened—a lot of the women, because he was really
19:10
a really nice-looking, very handsome young man, very handsome.
19:14
But, see, it’s more than just being beautiful or handsome on the outside,
19:20
if you don’t have the right kind of character and you don’t know how to
19:24
treat people, then no matter how you look on the outside doesn’t make any
19:27
difference if your heart is not right.
19:30
His heart just wasn’t because his heart had been damaged, too, by his dad.
19:36
Those are things that I didn’t know at that particular time.
19:42
Anyway, I divorced him and so there were some women, I mean
19:45
they never said anything to me.
19:47
I was also a fighter.
19:48
I would fight to the death, to the end.
19:51
Because I know now that it was because I was trying to protect myself and I
19:57
just wasn’t going to let anybody hurt me the way I had been hurt physically,
20:01
mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.
20:03
In
20:08
1973 is when I met my second husband, Arthur.
20:12
Because of my past, I wasn’t very nice to him in the beginning.
20:17
But he was persistent that I was going to be his girlfriend, and so I just
20:25
gave the poor guy the blues constantly.
20:29
But he hung in there and we eventually we did, after about 5 years, we
20:34
did get married and he was just who I was with until he passed away.
20:42
It was, there were struggles in our marriage.
20:45
But before that, let me back up a little bit.
20:49
In 1980, Mount St. Helens blew up May 18.
20:53
That same day, I had, well that night, I went to a birthday party.
20:58
My aunt and uncle, they were 7 years younger than me, they were twins, Tyree
21:03
and Terri, I went to their birthday party.
21:06
I had a little orange Pinto.
21:07
I was full of drugs and alcohol, and I lived out in north Portland off of
21:15
north Alaska Street in the Tamaracks.
21:17
I was on my way back home that morning, somewhere between
21:20
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.
21:20
It was really dark.
21:22
So, I’m trying to get home, but I’m really high.
21:26
I just looked up and I just said, God, if you are really there, just help me.
21:34
I will serve you for the rest of my life.
21:36
Now, I didn’t know that this was May 18th [laughs] , the same day
21:41
that Mount St. Helens blew up.
21:44
I can’t even tell you because I was so high.
21:46
I can’t even tell you how I got home.
21:48
I just figured that God, the angels, or somebody just brought me on home.
21:51
I parked my car.
21:52
I remember something bumping, because where I lived in the
21:56
Tamaracks I was on the lower level.
21:58
There was this great big cement circle where they planted the trees in there.
22:06
I remember the car hitting that and then the car kind of rolling
22:09
back a little bit but it stopped.
22:13
I went in the house.
22:15
[inaudible] , because we had just, before that we had just got married
22:18
in April, April 5, 1980, and then I gave my life to the Lord May 18, 1980.
22:27
After all, you know, after all this it just really changed my life, but I still
22:33
had so many different issues that I had to deal with because of, even though I
22:39
had given my life to the Lord it was just like, I was still kind of confused about
22:44
a lot of things and I would read my Bible and I remember one particular time, and
22:49
then I would drink every now and then but alcohol wasn’t my drink or drug of choice.
22:54
I liked drugs because it would take you out of yourself, so that’s what I did.
23:00
I remember I had walked up to Pay ‘n’ Take It, because we
23:03
lived out in north Portland.
23:05
I had walked up to Pay ‘n’ Take It I was reading my Bible, but I fit right,
23:08
I was thirsty, but I didn’t want water.
23:10
So, I remember I walked up to Pay ‘n’ Take It and I got me a Colt 45,
23:14
walked back home, I’m sitting there.
23:17
At this time, my husband, he’s at work, and I didn’t have to work that day.
23:21
I was sitting there.
23:22
I was reading the Bible and I had this 16 oz can of Colt 45,
23:29
so I’m pouring it in the glass.
23:30
I’m drinking and he walks in, and he’s like Veverly?
23:35
I thought you were a Christian.
23:37
Do Christians drink?
23:38
I said, I don’t know.
23:40
I really don’t.
23:41
I mean, I didn’t know.
23:45
I said, well, I don’t know.
23:46
I know it had to be the Lord, so I ended up going to the Book of Proverbs.
23:51
In Proverbs, I can’t even remember what chapter, but he was talking
23:54
about when you drink what happens when you drink and then you feel like?
23:59
I started laughing, because I said God really has a sense of
24:02
humor because this is funny.
24:04
I never even knew that this kind of language and how it was explained
24:09
that this was in the Bible.
24:13
I poured it out and I don’t think I ever drank anymore, except for yes I did.
24:19
I tried to drink some wine, tried to get my husband to drink some.
24:22
He just said, no.
24:24
He hadn’t given his life to the Lord.
24:25
He just, no.
24:27
I’m not drinking any wine.
24:29
I don’t want any of that.
24:30
So, after that I did got back a couple of times and I did get a couple of
24:37
pills, but I just felt so convicted until I just said, you know what?
24:40
This is not what I want to do, and so about that time I was almost 40 years old.
24:47
I met a really good friend at the church.
24:49
She was just a wonderful lady, Caucasian young woman.
24:53
I was about almost 13 years older than her.
24:58
She was working on getting her
25:02
degree.
25:02
She had gotten her degree.
25:03
She had gone to college up in Seattle.
25:05
She was working, she wanted to become a Christian psychologist.
25:09
I told her about some of the things that happened to me as a child, because I
25:12
still have a lot of these things that I really hadn’t dealt with, because I really
25:17
didn’t know how to deal with them, but I really credit it, part of my success
25:25
that I feel is successful for me of being healed was from my second husband because
25:32
he was real patient with me and he really loved and me and my best friend Carla.
25:38
She was working on becoming a Christian psychologist.
25:42
She just kept telling me Veverly the things that happened to
25:45
you, the things that were done to you, it wasn’t your fault.
25:48
You were a child.
25:49
You didn’t initiate anything because I kept: it’s my fault why
25:54
somebody would hurt me or touch me in some kind of way like that.
25:59
To me, it just felt like I didn’t really get a chance to be the kid
26:02
I wanted to be because somebody had interrupted my growth.
26:10
She worked with me for about 2 years and finally I started believing that it
26:16
wasn’t my fault and from there that’s when I was able to just start some of
26:21
that stuff to start breaking off, but I still have a lot of fear to deal with.
26:27
When we have all the different things that were going on here, you know,
26:30
in Portland with Black power, all the different organizations that were
26:39
popping up, NAACP—I forgot the name of them, the Black... Panthers, yeah,
26:45
the Black Panthers and a lot of that.
26:48
So, that was before I actually gave my life to the Lord.
26:50
So, a lot of that stuff I had been involved in, you know, just trying to find
26:54
out who I was, which really didn’t help.
26:56
But she did help me a tremendous amount.
26:59
I credit her and my second husband for being the people that really helped me to
27:07
grow and develop in a more healthier way.
27:11
So, let’s go back a little in terms of thinking about it as an African
27:16
American with that whole situation.
27:19
You did point out something about not wanting to call the
27:22
police because of the police—
27:26
Brutality, yeah.
27:27
It was awful.
27:28
Tell us a little more about the neighborhood of St. Johns and relations
27:33
with others and how being an African American entered into all that
27:41
picture in terms of relations with the whole racial environment around you.
27:47
Okay, because we were pretty young when I was in—like I
27:50
said, I went to kindergarten.
27:51
When we were there I went to Sitton Grade School.
27:53
I was about 5.
27:56
I really didn’t think too much, I didn’t know a lot about what was going on and I
28:02
kind of figured out that’s why my parents and my grandmother and I think they
28:08
wanted good things for us, and that’s why they would send us to Sunday school.
28:12
But I think that they knew a lot then, with my grandmother having like I said
28:19
PTSD, which they didn’t know anything about that then, but we really think
28:23
that that was the cause of all the anxiety and then all the hurts that
28:27
she and then seeing her dad and her uncle and stuff, seeing them killed.
28:32
I think that that really shaped her life.
28:35
I think a lot of my fears came not only from my mom but from my
28:40
grandmother because she was afraid of everything but she was mean.
28:47
It just caused a lot of problems and then she was really afraid of the police.
28:52
So, this is instilled in me too, because police we have to be careful
28:57
of them because they will hurt us because of the color of our skin
29:01
you know and that kind of thing, but
29:05
it’s just those things that you’re taught as a child.
29:07
Then, some of the things that are subliminal that you get as a child.
29:14
Tell us about those that you were taught and those things that were subliminal.
29:18
For the things that were subliminal were the things that my grandmother
29:23
would, I don’t even know how to describe this but maybe secrete out of her you
29:28
would feel her anxiousness sand then, or either her anxiety, because she—I
29:36
remember where, when we stayed with her the house, the address, I remember
29:40
it because it’s where the coliseum is at now, it was 1416 Northeast Ross
29:44
and she had this beautiful, her and my grandfather, he was our step grandfather.
29:51
They had this beautiful older home that had the wraparound porches.
29:55
I remember as kids that we could play outside.
29:57
We’d play in the neighborhood.
29:59
Everybody kind of knew everyone, so people would watch out for us, but if the police
30:05
came in the neighborhood, unless you knew them... it was a little bit better, I can
30:13
say that because some of the policemen used to walk, they used to call it
30:16
walking the beat, is what I think it is.
30:19
They knew a lot of the families, but then as it stated progressing you start
30:25
getting these younger police officers that didn’t know a lot of the families.
30:31
A majority of them were Caucasian, and they were very vicious
30:35
to a lot of our young men.
30:38
That started putting a lot of fear in us, too.
30:40
We cannot, we just cannot do a lot of the things that we felt we were saying
30:47
doing, even in our own neighborhoods.
30:50
What were some of those things?
30:52
We could play outside until about 8:00 or 9:00 at night, and we
30:56
could go to each other’s house.
30:58
My grandmother, they would leave their doors unlocked.
31:02
We used to sleep outside on the porch.
31:04
It was just
31:09
real different, really, really different.
31:15
Those were, even though there was turmoil sometimes within myself and even knowing
31:22
that my grandmother, we didn’t know that she had all these issues but we knew
31:26
something was going on inside of her.
31:28
But we were kids, so we didn’t know because she had—I’d like
31:32
to say personality changes.
31:34
So,
31:37
it affected me a lot maybe because I was the oldest grandchild.
31:41
I’m not sure, but anyway.
31:43
So, you’re saying that you could sleep out on the porch.
31:48
Yeah, we could sleep outside.
31:48
So, then, when the police, was it you would stop doing that when
31:52
those set of younger police came?
31:56
Yeah.
31:56
So, it wasn’t the same.
31:59
We were afraid of them because they were mean.
32:04
What were some
32:07
of the things that they actually did?
32:09
Yeah.
32:09
Some of the things—
32:09
Some stories.
32:10
Okay, some stories that I can remember, there was a young man, a young Black man.
32:17
He was killed when we were kids by the police.
32:22
So, that caused some uproar.
32:25
We still, I still really didn’t know, to this day, what he supposedly
32:29
had done, but from what they had said is that he was kind of like in
32:34
the wrong place at the wrong time.
32:36
How can you be in the wrong place at the wrong time and you’re not doing anything?
32:41
You’re just in your neighborhood and you’re playing or whatever.
32:46
Another thing, the policemen, you better not talk back to them.
32:52
Period.
32:52
You better not say anything.
32:54
Then sometimes even if you didn’t say anything you still were harassed
32:59
or called names or whatever.
33:03
Tell us some of the whatevers.
33:05
Whatever would be like
33:09
what are you doing out at this time of night?
33:11
Your parents or did your mom or do you—?
33:13
Even I think for some kids, do you even know where’s your dad
33:16
at or do you even have a dad?
33:18
It was like these subtle put-downs.
33:21
They would say them, but there was more meaning behind it.
33:26
Those kind of things just made you feel like you weren’t what you needed to
33:34
be or what they thought you should be.
33:35
I don’t know.
33:40
It was just a hard time.
33:42
There were still fun times because I think that my grandmother and then also my mom
33:47
they tried to make better for us as best they knew how, but it wasn’t always easy.
33:55
It really wasn’t.
33:56
I didn’t really find out a lot of things until I became a parent and
34:03
figured it out.
34:03
Gosh, I mean parents they go through a lot.
34:07
They have to do a lot to protect their children, to protect themselves because
34:13
we live in a society right now that still puts Blacks down and makes us, tries to
34:20
make us feel insignificant or less than.
34:25
It’s just not good.
34:27
I’m sorry, are my
34:30
[looks around behind camera]
34:30
. Can you give some examples, stories of actual things?
34:37
Happening?
34:37
Happening, yeah, the actual things happening that either you
34:41
witness or you were told about?
34:43
Yeah, I know.
34:46
When we lived in the Tamaracks there was a young man, he was
34:51
really good friends with my sons.
34:57
I didn’t even realize that I guess in north Portland that they
35:00
even had gangs and that’s when the gangs that kind of stuff.
35:03
I thought it was in the ‘90s, but I remember that William, I think that was
35:07
his name, he was killed by another kid.
35:10
There were some things that were going on even in the late ‘70s, early
35:15
‘80s, because, a matter of fact, I moved from the Tamaracks in 1980s.
35:21
All those three significant things: I married, I got saved [I came to
35:25
know the Lord], and then we moved.
35:29
We moved because I was trying to get my kids out of that area, especially
35:34
when William, when he got killed, because it really affected my boys.
35:37
Of course, the police were involved.
35:42
My kids, two of my sons, that would be, because they are
35:46
the oldest: Andre and Alander.
35:49
They were really good friends with him and so they were just really,
35:53
you know, just feeling bad because the police wouldn’t let them.
35:57
Of course, you know that’s a dangerous thing when there’s bullets flying and
36:01
somebody has been killed by another kid.
36:05
They have guns out.
36:06
They’re trying to find out who did what and they’re asking kids questions
36:10
very disrespectful of the kids.
36:13
I didn’t know this until the kids came back home and told me very
36:17
disrespectful of them and almost accusatory things that they—and derogatory
36:22
things that they would say to them.
36:24
Give us some more examples of things.
36:24
Saying things like,
36:29
I guess, about who they are.
36:32
Where are your parents?
36:33
Why are you out here?
36:34
You know?
36:35
Then kind of put-downs.
36:36
Don’t you think you’re too young to be out here?
36:39
How do you know this person?
36:41
I don’t remember all of it, but there was just a lot of different questions
36:44
because this was, like I said, end of, almost—end of about ’79, because
36:51
my one son was just born in ’79.
36:57
I don’t remember exactly what the words were, but I know that they felt really,
37:00
really bad about how they were treated during that time from the police and then
37:07
from some parents, because it was just horrible having a child kid back then.
37:15
I think he was only, he must have been about 13, 12 or 13 years old.
37:19
It was just really sad.
37:21
It really affected everyone, affected my life and my children’s lives.
37:26
That was one of the reasons I then wanted to move.
37:33
Moved out and found a house over on Skidmore and Albina
37:40
and lived there for a while, from 1980 to 1985.
37:49
That’s about 5 years later, 1990, that’s when the, I can’t think of the Crips
37:55
and the Bloods started coming up here.
37:57
Two of my sons were involved in the Crips.
38:04
They got caught up in that and just so many things happened.
38:09
Our house got shot in once.
38:13
Then my youngest son, he got in some trouble.
38:17
The police, they—and Margaret Carter is my husband’s, my
38:21
second husband’s, she’s his aunt.
38:22
She was a
38:27
Chief Moose back then, was part of it.
38:30
My youngest son had gotten into some trouble, and so the police, they, you know
38:35
those big lights that they use downtown?
38:37
Those sky lights that shine up in the sky?
38:40
Well, they put that on our front door just to intimidate us.
38:45
That was a direct thing for us and so my husband, he just
38:50
said, I’m calling Aunt Margaret.
38:52
So, he called her.
38:53
She called the chief of police, and that was Chief Moose at that time.
38:59
He made his, the police, he made them move that and then second time something
39:05
happened, they used a battering ram on our door, busted down the house,
39:10
they just ram shacked our house.
39:11
Yeah, so it wasn’t really, I’ve had some really nasty experiences with
39:18
police officers, especially with those two significant incidents.
39:24
Then my son, the one that I told you that’s 47, Amone, he went to jail because
39:33
they did, I think it was kind of a gang sweep in the mid ‘90s and it was a thing
39:44
that they used for people that are, organized crime is what you call it.
39:55
So, they did a sweep on the Bloods and the Crips.
39:59
A lot of them went to the penitentiary for several years.
40:04
My son, Amone, I think Amone, he got 8 years.
40:09
Yeah, so, and
40:13
then my younger son, after they went through with the big light and
40:17
then the tearing down our doors just damaging, I mean, just they tore, the
40:23
police they just tore up our house.
40:25
They did it.
40:25
They just did it on purpose just because they could.
40:28
It made me just—I had so many different feelings, so many different emotions, so
40:35
I just had no respect for them at all, because they didn’t have to do that.
40:40
I mean, my husband and I both worked.
40:42
We never dealt drugs or did any of that.
40:47
We attributed it is that they were mad because Aunt Margaret,
40:53
she had talked to Chief Moose.
40:54
I mean, this was my own hypothesis, so that’s the way I thought of it.
40:57
They were angry and so when they did get this warrant so that
41:03
they could come into the house.
41:04
But I had no idea that they were going to just ram shack our house the way they did.
41:10
It took us months to try to get everything back together.
41:14
I mean, they just—it was awful.
41:17
You
41:21
know, you have to give respect where respect is due, and a
41:25
lot of them, they don’t respect Black people as being anything.
41:30
Like I said, my husband and I, I’ve always worked all my
41:33
life, just I’ve always worked.
41:38
He had always worked.
41:40
We had gotten into some things.
41:42
I did, when I was about early 20s, I think, I ended up going to jail for
41:49
a minute because I used to shoplift.
41:51
I wasn’t, what do they call it, a kleptomaniac or a
41:56
whatever, a kleptomaniac.
41:57
I just, I would steal.
41:58
So, I got all these names, Mack Rogue, Black people we can hang names.
42:08
We give them all kinds of nicknames.
42:09
What are some of the nicknames?
42:10
Well, mine was Mack Rogue, because they said that I was a good shoplifter.
42:17
Those kinds of things like that.
42:20
When I went to jail, and the judge told me, he says, you’ve
42:24
been here in my courtroom before.
42:26
He says, this is it.
42:27
He says, you’re not, and I was working then.
42:30
I was working at Tektronix.
42:32
So, he says, you’re not, this isn’t going to happen again.
42:34
He says, I told you if you came back in my court that I
42:36
was going to send you to jail.
42:37
I had just a baby.
42:39
I
42:41
had just had Amone, so I went to jail for about 10 days.
42:44
His father and his father’s mom they took care of my son.
42:51
Then my mom took care of my other kids while I was incarcerated.
42:54
Then that was another significant moment in my life.
42:59
Do you want to continue on this route?
43:03
Or what are you going to do?
43:04
Because you have a job.
43:05
You need to take care of your kids.
43:09
So, that helped change my life.
43:13
But then, you have to remember I was still angry about a lot of stuff, so a
43:16
lot of things I was doing it was because I didn’t really realize all the stuff.
43:20
I knew something was going on inside of me, but a lot of times you don’t know
43:23
until you can get somebody, a professional or someone that knows a little bit
43:28
more about things and the different traumas that have happened in your life.
43:34
All those things have shaped me.
43:36
But, like I said, it shaped me to become the person that I am now.
43:40
I really love, respect people, even the police.
43:45
I mean, because they’re people, too.
43:46
Some of them are just misguided.
43:49
A lot of them have things that are going on inside of them that they don’t even
43:53
realize, that they haven’t even checked so they take it out on other people.
43:57
I think every once in a while we all do that, because it’s
44:01
part of the human nature.
44:04
That’s what we do.
44:05
When you’re around in Portland or wherever and you see police,
44:10
what’s your gut response?
44:12
Or
44:14
gut reaction?
44:18
That’s interesting that you ask me that.
44:21
I don’t really have a lot of fear, but I am cautious.
44:26
I can say that.
44:28
I am cautious.
44:29
I
44:31
do like to drive fast, so I worked on that.
44:36
I have a few speeding tickets.
44:39
I haven’t had any in quite a while, but yeah.
44:45
Just making sure that hopefully that I’m doing the right thing so that
44:49
I won’t get stopped by the police.
44:50
I really don’t want to get stopped by them at all.
44:55
I don’t want that.
44:56
I don’t want any kind of interaction with them unless it’s on a different level.
45:03
We do have police officers actually at our church, Marcy Jackson.
45:07
I’m actually, I taught her son when I was at, oh, and I forgot about that
45:11
job, Lutheran Inner City Ministries.
45:14
I was there for about 3 years.
45:20
I taught the kindergarten and the after school program and then I became
45:28
the director of the program until it ended.
45:31
So,
45:35
let’s—so, let’s just go through
45:42
your education and then we’ll go through your employment.
45:47
Okay.
45:52
As you were describing where your education up through your college,
46:01
talk a little, tell us about some of the challenges that you were faced
46:06
with being an African American, how you dealt with those or maybe
46:11
there weren’t so many challenges.
46:13
Give us a whole idea.
46:16
Let’s just, we’re going to quickly start with kindergarten
46:21
and kind of just get us through.
46:24
Okay, my kindergarten years?
46:25
Or just going to school to become a—
46:29
Well, starting, starting in your first schooling up until your—
46:34
Until I finally went to college?
46:36
Okay, so,
46:39
like I said I went to Sitton
46:43
when I was in kindergarten through first grade.
46:47
We moved from St. Johns when I was in second grade and that’s when I
46:54
was able to go to Immaculate Heart.
46:56
I was in second grade when we moved over here, almost 8.
47:01
So, was that—
47:02
From St. Johns.
47:04
I went to kindergarten at Sitton Grade School,
47:11
kindergarten, first grade and then second grade at Immaculate Heart.
47:16
We moved from St. Johns to the northeast side.
47:21
In those schools were they mainly African Americans or mixed or what?
47:28
I think it was mixed.
47:29
Being younger like that I really didn’t pay too much attention
47:32
to the color so much then.
47:36
I really don’t, I really can’t tell you why.
47:39
I don’t know.
47:40
But I really didn’t pay too much attention because I did have
47:43
friends that were Caucasian and that I played with continually.
47:48
I don’t really think from that aspect, I don’t really think
47:51
that we thought about color.
47:54
We knew, I mean, I didn’t know then, but the pigmentation we knew it was different
47:59
but that didn’t make a difference to us.
48:03
Then when I went to Immaculate Heart when we moved over here, then I did start
48:10
noticing something a little bit different.
48:13
They were subtle nuances, like
48:19
some of the White people—when you go to the grocery store, I remember
48:21
going to the store with my mom, you go to the grocery store and some of
48:24
the White people they would look at us a little bit differently like we
48:29
really weren’t supposed to be here.
48:31
That’s what I felt.
48:33
The reason probably why I’m thinking this is because I’m sure
48:36
that my mother said something
48:39
to her friends or whatever.
48:41
I’m sure she said something, so I picked up on that.
48:45
These are other subtle nuances.
48:47
I don’t remember the exact words, but I knew something was different.
48:51
Like I said, my mom, she used to watch all those scary movies and things.
48:55
All this different, these subtle nuances from people looking at us
48:59
a little bit differently when we go to the grocery store or walking
49:02
in certain neighborhoods that maybe you weren’t supposed to be here.
49:08
When you say looking at a little bit differently, can you describe—?
49:12
I don’t know if I—I’m trying to describe it, but it’s kind of, you know Ruth, it’s
49:17
kind of really hard to describe because it’s just something that you feel and
49:22
I remember one particular time, I think we were on Williams, either Williams
49:29
Avenue... on North Williams Avenue.
49:34
I was walking with my mom and this White guy was driving in his car
49:43
and he said, I don’t remember what he said, but there were some slurs,
49:47
some words that he said to my mom.
49:50
She kind of just like put me back this way, because whatever he was going
49:56
to do she was going to protect me.
49:59
I remember kind of like peeping around her.
50:02
He was saying something that was probably really derogatory, because
50:06
it made her, I felt her body tense up.
50:11
But, like I said, I knew that she put me over to the side because she was going to
50:14
protect me, whatever he was going to do.
50:16
Some of the things some people would say them out, they would say them out
50:21
loud and then other people you would get looks, a look or you know sometimes
50:31
women, White women would be driving in their cars.
50:33
They’d see a Black person and you would hear their doors.
50:36
They would lock, locking their doors.
50:39
So, you’re
50:42
like what?
50:43
You’re going to jump in their car?
50:44
Yeah, what in the world?
50:46
Nobody is thinking about you in that way.
50:50
These are all things that a lot of Blacks have had to put up with
50:54
for years and years and years and even now sometimes it’s even worse.
50:59
It’s
51:02
just hard to describe some of these nuances and little subtleties that happen.
51:07
I think those are really interesting.
51:09
They are, but—
51:11
But can you
51:15
think of more ways to describe them or remember?
51:22
I don’t know, sometimes it’s hard to really think about them because they’re
51:25
so far gone now, except for when you’re in certain situations then something
51:33
will pop up in your heart, your brain.
51:36
Oh, gosh, do we have to go through this again?
51:40
Haven’t we had enough of this?
51:45
When you see things on TV, when you see things, and you
51:48
hear things from your friends.
51:50
People getting killed.
51:53
Like the Ferguson thing.
51:55
All the different things that have went on that always revolved
51:59
around a Black and a White.
52:02
Why should it have to be like this?
52:04
It’s because of human nature.
52:06
We just don’t know how to love one another.
52:10
When you have it in your heart that you’re better than somebody
52:14
else, then there’s something wrong.
52:17
There really is something wrong.
52:19
It’s not the other person.
52:20
Usually, it’s you, and its things that you haven’t really dealt with
52:24
in your own heart, in your own mind.
52:26
I know that’s true because I had to do it for myself.
52:33
Back then to your education.
52:36
So, you went—so for your high school?
52:41
Yeah, I went to Jefferson.
52:43
I went to Jeff.
52:44
And Jefferson was mainly African American?
52:48
It was really African American back then.
52:50
Man, we had some good track runners.
52:52
Oh, man.
52:53
We had really a lot of cool people that were just, they put Jefferson on the map.
53:00
They really did.
53:02
I think it was Leon Lincoln, he was one of them as far as in track.
53:07
He really put Jefferson High School on, and then the Jefferson Dancers.
53:13
All, the, I mean so many significant things that went on at Jefferson
53:18
High School that had nothing to do with Jefferson the man that
53:24
they named the high school after, nothing to do with him whatsoever.
53:28
I mean, we knew that.
53:31
Even back then, we knew that, but he wasn’t the focal point for any of us.
53:36
It was the kids that made the school great.
53:39
It really was.
53:43
I really can’t stand it right now that so many people want to
53:46
change the name from Jefferson.
53:47
It’s historical.
53:49
But
53:51
Jeff is where I graduated from there, 1964.
53:56
My first husband, he graduated from there in 1963.
54:03
That was really good.
54:05
A little bit after, a few years after that, I ended up working at Tektronix.
54:11
I worked there, yeah I did, I worked there from
54:16
1978 to
54:20
1990.
54:20
Then that’s when I actually went back to school.
54:23
I started at PCC in 1992.
54:27
PTC is?
54:27
PCC—I’m sorry.
54:31
Sometimes, PCC.
54:32
What does it stand for?
54:34
Portland Community College.
54:35
I’m sorry, yeah.
54:38
I graduated, when I started in 1992 and graduated from there in
54:44
1995 and worked for a while at Lutheran Inner City Ministries.
54:50
I worked there from ’95, right after I had graduated.
54:53
They hired me.
54:54
I worked there from ’95 to ’98.
54:57
In between there, I went back to school.
55:01
I ended up going to Warner Pacific College.
55:04
I went there for like 2 months.
55:06
It just wasn’t a good fit for me.
55:08
So, I ended up going to, and I can’t even think of it.
55:12
They’ve changed the name of the college now.
55:14
It’s a college that’s in Salem.
55:16
I really liked it, because when I went back in ’98, was looking
55:21
around after I left Warner Pacific, I was looking for another Christian
55:25
College and found this one.
55:27
They had just started a pilot program on Hawthorne.
55:30
I think it was somewhere between 60th and 62nd in Hawthorne.
55:34
So, it was in a building.
55:36
They were renting it.
55:37
But the college, the actual college, was in Salem.
55:41
Once a month we had to go down on Saturdays and do our class down there.
55:48
That was really interesting and that was really good, and I did that
55:55
’98, my son, youngest son, like I mentioned earlier, he was, got mixed up
56:03
with the Crips with his other brother.
56:06
He ended up getting shot 6 times and he’s alive and well.
56:14
It was by another rival gang, the Bloods.
56:18
He was walking, he was on his way home and actually my son is a real fighter.
56:24
He likes to fight instead of using guns and that kind of thing.
56:29
He had beat up, 2 young men had jumped him and so he beat them,
56:34
beat the mess out of both of them.
56:37
To retaliate, they thought that he was at his home but he was actually, went over to
56:42
one of my neighbors that lived, we lived on Cook Street, Northeast Cook Street
56:47
between Cook and Williams and Rodney.
56:50
He was on his way home, but he decided he was going to go
56:53
up to the neighbor’s house.
56:55
They had hid behind this van, well, it was actually one of the guys.
56:59
He had hid behind the van.
57:00
As my son was going up the steps, I heard this pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
57:04
pop, pop, pop, pop, because it was in September but it was really warm.
57:08
Sometimes we have those warm summers.
57:10
We had the windows up and I was upstairs, and so I just started praying.
57:15
I said, oh, my God.
57:16
Whoever that is, please don’t let them die.
57:20
Because we were hearing gunshots almost every night in different neighborhoods.
57:27
Come to find out, that it was my son.
57:31
They thought that he was at home.
57:33
They didn’t know where he lived, but they thought he was going home.
57:36
They shot him in his back, lower pelvic area, bullets went
57:41
in and out, the police said.
57:42
That was one time police, they were really nice.
57:45
They were really helpful.
57:46
Because I was trying to, because we had Kaiser for our insurance and
57:50
so we were going to take him there.
57:52
They said, no he’s been shot.
57:53
He has to go to a trauma hospital.
57:55
He has to go.
57:57
They, I finally, rescinded and let them, okay.
58:00
Alright.
58:00
He’ll take him to Emanuel.
58:02
So they took him there.
58:04
He was in the hospital for a little bit, and he still has one bullet in him.
58:10
The other 5 went out.
58:11
One lodged in an area where they couldn’t operate to take it out.
58:15
He has to take iron and do orange juice, because he has lead in him.
58:23
Didn’t want to get that into his brain or anything.
58:29
That was a hard one.
58:30
I had a really, I had the police were really, really nice to us.
58:35
I can say that.
58:36
They were really helpful and just helped us a lot.
58:42
I’m thankful for that, because that was a real traumatizing
58:47
time in both of our lives for me and my husband and his siblings.
58:52
We
58:54
were—
58:55
In school.
58:56
In school.
58:57
Yeah, so I was in school then, so I had to, after he got
59:01
shot I couldn’t finish up.
59:05
I waited, this was ’99, so I didn’t go back to school until 2 years later,
59:14
2001.
59:14
Since I had so many credits from Portland Community College and
59:19
the 2 colleges, one at Pacific and from the other school, everything
59:24
transferred over because I enrolled.
59:26
I ended up enrolling at Portland State after I knew he was going
59:30
to be fine and everything.
59:32
I graduated from Portland State with my bachelor’s degree, Bachelor of Science.
59:39
What did you study?
59:40
Child and family studies.
59:42
I did that and I graduated in 2002.
59:48
So, when you were going to Portland State, or any of the other colleges,
59:54
were there any particular challenges you found as being an African American?
1:00:00
No, it wasn’t—I mean, because when I started at Warner Pacific I think it was
1:00:08
in ’98, I don’t know.
1:00:10
I had went through so many different challenges, so many different things that
1:00:13
happened until I just wanted to go to school because I wanted to get my degree.
1:00:17
Whatever of the challenges people had, I just, that wasn’t my stuff.
1:00:23
It was actually theirs.
1:00:25
I really didn’t pick up on a lot of different things.
1:00:27
It could have been happening, but I really didn’t see it or I wasn’t aware of it.
1:00:36
Like I said, it just wasn’t a good fit for me.
1:00:38
It wasn’t anything anyone had done.
1:00:41
I just decided after 2 months I didn’t want to stay there.
1:00:46
No one did anything to me specifically that I can think of.
1:00:50
I ended up going to the other college that was, like I said, the pilot
1:00:54
program from Salem, because their main school is in Salem, Oregon.
1:00:59
That was a really, I was with a cohort, a group of 15 people, and so
1:01:05
we were going to graduate together.
1:01:07
Like I said, after my son got shot, I had to leave.
1:01:10
So, I just couldn’t go back.
1:01:11
I just, and that’s why I ended up at Portland State, finishing there.
1:01:16
Was that a cohort of African Americans?
1:01:19
No.
1:01:20
It was, no.
1:01:22
It was only,
1:01:25
I was the only African American in that class.
1:01:27
Yeah, in that cohort.
1:01:29
It was 15 of us, and I was the only one.
1:01:33
Up until about 10 years ago, I was still in touch with a lot
1:01:37
of those, a few of the people.
1:01:39
Not all of them but a lot of them.
1:01:42
That was really good.
1:01:46
Then, Portland State.
1:01:48
How was that?
1:01:49
Portland State, because you have so many different people of color, every
1:01:54
nationality that you could think of.
1:01:57
I was there to get my degree.
1:02:00
That’s, I was just there to get my degree.
1:02:03
We discussed, at Portland State, you discuss a lot of things about
1:02:06
racism and all that kind of stuff.
1:02:11
I just wanted to get my papers done, get there and get out and that’s what I did.
1:02:17
I finished, yeah, went in 2001.
1:02:20
Like I said, all my credits transferred so it only took me less
1:02:23
than about a year to get finished.
1:02:25
I was in there and out and whatever else.
1:02:29
Then I did, I remember I took
1:02:33
an African American class, and I did learn some things from, oh what is his name?
1:02:38
He teaches there.
1:02:39
He’s probably retired by now.
1:02:43
I can’t think of his name, but he just, he showed us a lot of different things
1:02:48
and a lot of different movies and I know that they were all about racism and the
1:02:56
things that have happened to a lot of Blacks that were really hurtful for all
1:03:02
of us, and especially with the Jim Crow laws and things that have, you know, and I
1:03:08
just think that recently the Jim Crow laws went off, they just went off the books.
1:03:14
The thing is that the stuff that goes on, it comes out of
1:03:18
people’s hearts, so it’s in there.
1:03:21
A lot of the stuff—people are taught to hate.
1:03:26
Because kids, like is said, when we were growing up I had friends that were
1:03:29
white and it just, I mean we knew that the skin color probably was different,
1:03:35
but as kids and being that young we probably, we didn’t even think about that.
1:03:39
We would hug each other and play with each other.
1:03:42
We just did not have this.
1:03:45
One of the things I like to say is even though there were different things
1:03:49
that happened when I was younger, one of the things that I really appreciate
1:03:54
about my mom is that I remember this so significantly is that she said, because
1:03:59
you know, I don’t know if I asked her this when I was a teenager or whatever,
1:04:04
but she said, Veverly, you know what?
1:04:05
God made us all alike.
1:04:06
My mom was not religious or anything like that.
1:04:08
She said, God made us, we’re all alike.
1:04:10
She said, each person, we all have one brain.
1:04:12
We have two eyes.
1:04:14
We have one mouth.
1:04:16
She said, everybody has one nose, so even though the color of our skin might
1:04:21
be different, she said if you turn us inside out, we’re all the same color.
1:04:25
And we are.
1:04:29
That helped, too, a lot.
1:04:32
Because she didn’t, even though I know that my mother probably really dealt with
1:04:37
racism and that kind of thing, and she was a hard—she did teach us the work ethic,
1:04:42
my brother and I. No matter how bad and some of the crazy things that I did I
1:04:47
knew that nobody, no one owed me anything.
1:04:52
If I wanted stuff, I needed to work for it.
1:04:54
She taught us that.
1:04:55
She gave us a really good work ethic.
1:04:58
Now, let’s go through your jobs and let’s talk about what they
1:05:03
were and what you did in them.
1:05:05
Okay.
1:05:06
And what challenges that you faced
1:05:11
and what worked well.
1:05:12
Let me see.
1:05:12
So, I know from my earliest I had forgotten about this, my brother,
1:05:19
my mom used to, we used to work, we used to have to pick beans,
1:05:24
strawberries and that kind of thing.
1:05:27
That was our earliest job.
1:05:29
We worked for Alderman Farms.
1:05:31
They used to come, we used to have to get up at 4:00 in the morning, because
1:05:34
we had to be standing on the corner to catch the bus in the morning and they
1:05:38
would take us to these different farms.
1:05:40
We picked beans, strawberries, cherries, apples, anything that was
1:05:48
in bloom at that time, we picked.
1:05:50
We picked it and those were our earliest jobs for my brother and I. That’s
1:05:57
part of how my mom really taught us a work ethic, because we had to do that
1:06:01
in order to get our school clothes.
1:06:03
She
1:06:06
was a single parent, and she just—you know, she couldn’t do it all on her own.
1:06:10
We didn’t mind.
1:06:11
We were happy.
1:06:12
We didn’t like getting up that early, but that was the first
1:06:17
job that I can remember we had.
1:06:19
Then on from there, from I think from school, okay, high school, grade school,
1:06:26
high school, and I had other jobs.
1:06:30
I don’t remember a lot of them, because I had several jobs.
1:06:34
I was always getting different jobs.
1:06:35
I went to,
1:06:39
what is it?
1:06:41
POIC.
1:06:41
I went there for some training for a while and
1:06:48
that was a program.
1:06:49
They would pay you to go to school then, if you were just
1:06:55
trying to get credits or whatever.
1:06:57
That’s what I did.
1:06:58
I did that there.
1:06:59
Then
1:07:02
I worked for, oh I worked for CETA Comprehensive Employment Training Act.
1:07:07
I worked for them and I worked, I remember I worked for Traffic
1:07:12
Engineering in downtown Portland.
1:07:14
So, what did you do when you were working for—?
1:07:17
CETA?
1:07:18
Yeah.
1:07:19
What is Comprehensive...?
1:07:20
Comprehensive Employment Training Act, and that started in the late ‘70s, yeah.
1:07:29
I worked for them and I was a secretary.
1:07:32
Oh, and then I forgot about, I worked for the Public Defender’s Office.
1:07:38
I worked there.
1:07:39
I was a,
1:07:42
what do you call it?
1:07:42
Not a stenographer, but I would record all of the cases that
1:07:48
came through, so I would record.
1:07:49
I can’t believe—I used to type about 85 words per minute, no mistakes.
1:07:53
I could not believe that.
1:07:55
I was just proficient in it and typing.
1:07:58
Then I did go to,
1:08:04
back then you know they wanted you to go to typing school if you
1:08:07
wanted to become, you know, some kind of stenographer or you wanted
1:08:13
to type as a profession or whatever.
1:08:15
You’d have to go to school to get training for that, so I did that.
1:08:25
Yeah.
1:08:26
That was a 6
1:08:29
or 7-month program or something like that.
1:08:31
I know it was less than a year.
1:08:33
So, I did that.
1:08:36
Then a little while after that, then I started—after I went through all that
1:08:41
about ’78 is when I started, applied at Tektronix and worked for them from
1:08:51
1978 up to 1990.
1:08:56
I was able to, that’s how I was able to start going to school because I
1:08:59
really wanted to go back to school, and so it was myself—they were
1:09:03
going to lay off this other guy.
1:09:05
I
1:09:08
wanted to go back to school, so I went up to higher management and I
1:09:11
talked to them and asked them if they would be willing to switch and let
1:09:17
me be laid off with all the benefits.
1:09:20
They gave me the whole package that he was going to get.
1:09:23
So, I was able to get the package, so that’s how I was
1:09:26
able to go to school with them.
1:09:30
Describe to me what you did at Tektronix.
1:09:33
I built electronic circuit boards and didn’t do very well with those, so
1:09:40
they switched me over just kind of to see how I would do with building
1:09:44
oscilloscopes, and I did very well.
1:09:47
After everything, after all the electronic circuit boards, after they
1:09:51
were all done and everything, I would put these oscilloscopes together.
1:09:57
I would build them and add all of the circuit boards.
1:10:01
I did very well with that.
1:10:03
So, did they train you?
1:10:04
Yeah, they did.
1:10:06
They trained me how to build them, but I just caught on really fast
1:10:10
because, and it was something that was different and something I liked.
1:10:13
I don’t think that I really liked building the boards.
1:10:15
It was just too tedious.
1:10:17
When you applied for that job.
1:10:21
For the job?
1:10:21
What did they ask you?
1:10:22
What kind of skill did they ask you?
1:10:24
They didn’t.
1:10:25
They were training us because Tektronix was kind of new.
1:10:28
I mean, it was new.
1:10:30
They hired tons of people back then.
1:10:34
They tried to put you in a place where they felt that you
1:10:37
would be able to do well in.
1:10:39
They wanted you to do well because it was, that was part of the bonuses that you got.
1:10:43
A lot of times your bonuses were more than your paycheck.
1:10:47
They wanted you to do well, and so they did train you.
1:10:52
You had a trainer that trained you how to do the boards.
1:10:57
Like I said, I just, I really didn’t want to do that.
1:11:01
When I was offered to do, build the electronic, the scopes, when I was
1:11:07
offered, would I like to do this?
1:11:10
Then I had a trainer that trained me how to build them.
1:11:16
That worked out really well.
1:11:17
I did that until I left there in 1990.
1:11:20
That was my job.
1:11:21
Did you they pay you by the number?
1:11:25
By the units or whatever?
1:11:29
We got our certain pay, what we were going to be paid and then I think it
1:11:33
was every, maybe it was every 90 days they would see where you were at and
1:11:40
then if you were doing well I think you got a small increase on your pay.
1:11:46
But like I said, back then your bonuses were way more than your pay,
1:11:51
because I remember when I started if I remember correctly, I think we
1:11:55
were only making $1 and something an hour when we first started at Tek.
1:12:02
The bonus was based on?
1:12:04
How many, how much of the everything that we got out and it went through
1:12:11
well, and so they made good sales and so the sales were good and so it exceeded.
1:12:17
It had to exceed whatever it was.
1:12:20
Our bonuses were really good.
1:12:22
Sometimes, and even back then, $400 or $500 that was good money.
1:12:29
It really was.
1:12:32
I think that was part of my incentive, why I stayed so long, too.
1:12:38
It really helped a lot.
1:12:40
Especially I had 7 kids at that time, trying to raise kids and I also helped my
1:12:48
husband, Arthur, I knew some people that worked for Portland Housing Authority
1:12:55
and I helped him to get a job there.
1:12:57
I had a couple of friends that worked there.
1:13:00
They helped me.
1:13:01
What was his?
1:13:02
Portland Housing Authority—he, I
1:13:05
think he was working with the construction crew and that’s what he did there.
1:13:13
What did he do?
1:13:15
I don’t know.
1:13:16
They built things and I guess repaired things at the different apartment
1:13:21
complexes and that kind of thing.
1:13:25
That’s all I know.
1:13:26
Just in a variety of kinds of construction.
1:13:27
Yes.
1:13:33
While you were with Tektronix, did you have any challenges with
1:13:37
regards to being African American?
1:13:39
I
1:13:41
don’t think so.
1:13:42
I had so much fun at Tek.
1:13:44
I did.
1:13:45
They had really cool people there.
1:13:47
There were a lot of Caucasian people there, but they were pretty cool people.
1:13:52
We all got along, because were all, kind of like we were workers.
1:13:56
We all worked and we would have, I mean you had some people that had their
1:14:02
little stuff, but I knew how to put people in check, so I didn’t, too much,
1:14:09
especially women, men, if they were trying to get out of hand, or say anything
1:14:15
derogatory, you just say what you felt.
1:14:18
That’s what I would do.
1:14:20
A lot of times if you can be as honest as you possibly can with other people and
1:14:24
they see that you don’t, like you have some people that are up down, up down, up
1:14:31
down and constantly and not steady, so you never know how to perceive these people
1:14:37
because you don’t know what kind of action or reaction they’re going to display.
1:14:42
Basically, I’ve always, not always, but after I learned a few things,
1:14:47
a lot of things from the Lord, I was probably kind of even keeled.
1:14:51
Most of the time, I’m really, just kind of like upbeat and fun.
1:14:56
I like to have fun.
1:14:57
I like to laugh.
1:14:57
I like to make people feel comfortable.
1:15:00
I like to feed people and make sure that they, you know that they feel good.
1:15:06
I think part of the, and safe.
1:15:07
You’re going to be safe with me.
1:15:09
I’m not going to try to hurt you.
1:15:11
I’m not going to say things to try to make you feel bad or put
1:15:15
you down in that kind of way.
1:15:16
I want you to have fun.
1:15:18
I want when you leave from, when we depart from each other, I want
1:15:24
you to say, gosh that was fun.
1:15:25
I had fun.
1:15:26
We had a good time.
1:15:31
You mentioned a little bit about during the Civil Rights Movement.
1:15:36
During that time, did you participate?
1:15:41
What was your relation to all of the activities that were going on?
1:15:45
I didn’t really participate in a lot of those.
1:15:47
I had too many kids.
1:15:49
I would talk to friends and that kind of thing about different things, but
1:15:53
as far as marching and that kind of thing, I just, I really didn’t do that.
1:16:00
What was, and what is your opinion about all of it—there are all the
1:16:06
different groups, so you have the Blank Panthers, you have the NAACP.
1:16:09
You have others, different churches.
1:16:12
Can you tell us about what you knew about that or know about it
1:16:19
and what your opinion is about all of that that was going on?
1:16:25
I had my opinions, but you know a lot of times when you think about it,
1:16:31
your opinions don’t usually matter to certain people because if you
1:16:36
don’t line up with what they believe or whatever, it causes turmoil.
1:16:41
Even
1:16:43
though I said like I was a scrapper, I was a fighter, and I
1:16:46
did have some humungous opinions.
1:16:49
They probably weren’t all that good or great or whatever, but I
1:16:53
did have my thoughts about things.
1:16:55
I thought that a lot of things that went on that they were wrong and I try to
1:17:01
think are there any ways that we can help each other to be able to help every race?
1:17:08
Not just the Black race or the White race.
1:17:11
How can we just?
1:17:13
Are there ways that we can try to help one another.
1:17:16
It just didn’t seem like it was going to happen, even with all the stuff that I saw
1:17:22
what made me really sad is watching some of the stuff on TV of the peaceful walk
1:17:27
with Martin Luther King and other groups, the difference between Martin Luther King
1:17:31
and Malcom X and the different things.
1:17:35
Both of them had significant things that they were trying to do to help.
1:17:40
But there was such a diverse, diversity between the two men and
1:17:45
how they felt and how both of their lives were taken way too young.
1:17:51
They were trying to help.
1:17:56
You know, everybody, especially Martin Luther King, but I know that Malcom X
1:18:00
had his own, but I think from my own perspective I think that he really
1:18:06
wanted to, if he could get the police or whoever the people that were hurting us,
1:18:11
African American people, if he could get them to understand that we are people.
1:18:15
We bleed just like you do.
1:18:17
We bleed the same color blood.
1:18:20
Somebody needs to understand this.
1:18:21
It’s more than just the outward appearance, but there were so
1:18:26
many others that were just making it really hard for all of us.
1:18:30
It’s still going on, even today.
1:18:35
Back then I just, like I said, I really didn’t do any marching or
1:18:39
any of that because I was too busy trying to take care of my children.
1:18:43
Would you have done any of that...
1:18:45
I don’t know.
1:18:47
...if you didn’t have.
1:18:47
I really, I don’t know, because I didn’t do it.
1:18:53
I don’t know.
1:18:58
Tell us also,
1:19:02
okay, after Tek, we didn’t get into what your work was.
1:19:05
After Tektronix, I just realized, after you finished getting your degree.
1:19:10
Now get into that part.
1:19:11
Yes.
1:19:13
I went to Lutheran.
1:19:15
Right after I graduated from PCC in ’95, I applied for a job at
1:19:22
Lutheran Inner City Ministries.
1:19:24
I saw an advertisement.
1:19:25
I think it was either, I don’t think it was on TV.
1:19:29
I saw it someplace.
1:19:30
It was an advertisement.
1:19:31
They were looking for a kindergarten teacher, and an after school teacher.
1:19:37
I applied, and I got that.
1:19:40
I worked there, like I said, from ’95 until ’98.
1:19:45
They didn’t stay open very long.
1:19:47
There were just, you know, a lot of different things going on at that time, so
1:19:52
they didn’t have really good leadership.
1:19:53
That shut down.
1:19:56
Then, oh, and then I had another job.
1:19:59
Actually I forgot about these jobs, and they were significant in my life.
1:20:03
After I left Lutheran Inner City Ministries, I started
1:20:06
working for Chris Dickey.
1:20:10
She opened up a Montessori preschool in north, northeast Portland.
1:20:15
Actually, it was only a block and a half from Lutheran Inner City Ministry.
1:20:20
Before that, okay, so she had rented a room, a classroom from
1:20:25
Lutheran Inner City Ministries.
1:20:28
They had a, it was a house, and I think it was called the Rose House.
1:20:32
I could be wrong, but I think it was Rose something.
1:20:35
She rented that and started her Montessori preschool there.
1:20:39
I liked that, because I had learned a lot about Maria Montessori when I was
1:20:43
in school and how she taught children.
1:20:49
When I knew that Lutheran, that they would be shutting down in ’98, I just
1:20:52
transitioned over and started working for Mrs. Chris, because she moved out.
1:20:56
They closed, they shut it down, and so she bought a home on Skidmore and Mallory.
1:21:03
I started—my daughter, my youngest daughter worked for her first and
1:21:08
then I started working for her and I became like her right hand person.
1:21:16
I worked for her for about 5 years and it was really, really a good time.
1:21:20
I really, I just call her a really cool White lady.
1:21:24
I’m not lying.
1:21:25
She was really, really nice.
1:21:28
She understood the concept, but she wanted nothing but young, younger
1:21:32
3-year-olds in her Montessori preschool.
1:21:35
She wanted to teach them from 3, we taught them from 3 to 5 and
1:21:39
graduated them to kindergarten.
1:21:42
I worked for, like I said, I worked for her for about 5 years and best
1:21:46
time I had, and another good way of looking at people from their
1:21:52
hearts and not their skin color.
1:21:55
She was really—I mean she still is.
1:21:58
I haven’t talked to Mrs. Chris in a while.
1:22:00
I thought about her.
1:22:00
I really need to call her and see how she’s doing.
1:22:03
So, she made a really neat impact on my life.
1:22:08
She had 38 kids that graduated from her school and she set it up through
1:22:13
her sorority that each one of those kids would get a 2-year ride at any
1:22:17
community college that she chose.
1:22:20
One of my grandsons was a recipient.
1:22:22
Matter of fact, I
1:22:25
have 5 of my grandchildren went to her school.
1:22:28
Oh yeah?
1:22:29
Mm-mm [nods] . They’re really, really good.
1:22:32
Then, while I was working for her, I was also working for Piedmont
1:22:37
Peace Place afterschool program and I became the program director there.
1:22:43
Piedmont?
1:22:44
Piedmont Peace Place after school program.
1:22:47
I worked there from 2001—yeah, that was before I had finished up
1:22:55
at Portland State.
1:22:56
I was in the midst of, I was working, actually working 2 jobs, because I
1:23:00
was working with Mrs. Chris, because both of them were part-time jobs.
1:23:03
I was working for Mrs. Chris for 3 hours.
1:23:08
Then I would work for Piedmont Peace Place for another 3 hours,
1:23:12
and then I was still, I was in school working on getting my degree.
1:23:17
So, I was working and going to school, which a lot of people have done.
1:23:23
Then trying to raise my family.
1:23:31
And after that?
1:23:33
After those jobs?
1:23:36
I started working for Friends of—
1:23:38
Well, what year were those?
1:23:41
Those were—I worked for Mrs. Chris.
1:23:43
She shut her school down in
1:23:48
2005, but I began both of those in 1998.
1:23:52
Yeah, because I had just graduated in ’95 from PCC, and so I worked from
1:23:57
’95 to ’98 for Lutheran Inner City Ministries and then Mrs. Chris was
1:24:03
in there, so I worked for her from about the end of ’98 until 2005.
1:24:14
Then I started working at Piedmont Peace Place in 2001.
1:24:21
I worked there until 2007.
1:24:26
Then they shut down because of funding.
1:24:30
Both of then, Lutheran Inner city, both of them shut down because of
1:24:34
funding, but Mrs. Chris just closed her school because she was finished.
1:24:37
She wanted to get 38 kids to go through the school because that was the funding
1:24:41
that they had from the sorority to give to 38 kids the 2-year ride paid for.
1:24:50
Then in 2008, I started working for Friends of the
1:24:54
Children—8, 9, 10, 11, almost 12.
1:24:59
I was there going into my fourth year with Friends of the Children.
1:25:01
So, 2008 to two thousand—.
1:25:01
’11. Because I was going into, I started April 8, then 9, 10, 11, almost 4 years.
1:25:02
In between that, because then my husband was diagnosed in
1:25:02
2007 with the lung cancer.
1:25:02
Then, like I said, I started working for Friends of the
1:25:02
Children in 2008, from 2008 to ’11,
1:25:10
and
1:25:14
then right
1:25:42
after that is when, in ’11, when I left Friends of the Children because my husband
1:25:47
had passed away in 2009, September.
1:25:51
I
1:25:53
was just kind of, so I wasn’t, to be honest, I just wasn’t really
1:25:58
feeling the mentorship anymore.
1:26:00
It was because of all the emotional trauma from losing my husband and a lot of stuff.
1:26:05
I just needed something that wasn’t so intense because at Friends
1:26:08
of the Children you can work anywhere from 12 to 13 hours a day.
1:26:12
Of course, all my kids were grown, but I just, I was already
1:26:15
traumatized from losing my husband.
1:26:17
I just couldn’t do it anymore.
1:26:19
So, I ended up—that’s when I ended up, my niece asked me to come
1:26:26
and work for her, the SUN school program at Boise-Eliot/Humboldt.
1:26:30
I had just left Friends of the Children.
1:26:37
I left there August 18, 2011, and started working for SEI October, yeah,
1:26:51
2011.
1:26:52
And you’re still working there?
1:26:53
Mm-hmm [nods] . Yeah I’ve been there, like I said, this is the 9th year.
1:26:59
What’s SEI stand for?
1:26:59
It’s a Self Enhancement Incorporated.
1:27:01
Yeah, look it up.
1:27:02
It’s a really interesting program.
1:27:05
It’s for under-deserved children.
1:27:08
I know when they first started it they were saying underprivileged,
1:27:10
but that didn’t sound very good.
1:27:12
So, they changed it to under-deserved children, under-served.
1:27:17
Not under-deserved.
1:27:20
I’m sorry—under-served children.
1:27:22
Yeah in north and northeast Portland.
1:27:24
So,
1:27:34
in all this work what were some of your main challenges
1:27:43
would you say?
1:27:46
I think the significant things were,
1:27:53
I’ve had several surgeries.
1:27:55
I had, well, actually 4 knee replacement surgeries.
1:27:58
I’m just very thankful to even be walking.
1:28:01
I
1:28:03
exercise too much and I found out,
1:28:08
well, later after, I don’t know if you, you probably, I don’t know if
1:28:11
you exercise a lot, or if you walk, but I used to do Zumba, jazzercise,
1:28:17
high impact aerobics, all of the step.
1:28:20
I did all that, and so back in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s they didn’t know
1:28:26
that it was bad on your back and your knees and that especially the high
1:28:30
impact aerobics, so I ended up, which I didn’t know that my mom, she didn’t
1:28:38
tell my brother and I, I guess she had really bad knees and that kind of thing.
1:28:43
A lot of times they didn’t, when I was growing up, nobody really talked about
1:28:48
their health or what was wrong with them.
1:28:49
They just took a pill or whatever they did and just dealt with
1:28:53
whatever was going on with them.
1:28:56
So, I found out later that we had, and my brother has it, too.
1:29:02
We have what they call silent arthritis.
1:29:04
I had never heard of that.
1:29:05
I didn’t know what it was.
1:29:07
It’s hereditary in families.
1:29:09
A lot of people need to be checked for this, and especially—I don’t
1:29:14
know if it’s mainly more so in the African American community, but there
1:29:19
is, you can exercise, and I used to exercise at least 2 hours a day
1:29:26
almost every day until I found out you need to take a break at least
1:29:31
take 2 days off, only if you’re going to exercise 3, the 5 days.
1:29:34
Don’t do 6 days and don’t do 7 because your body has to repair itself.
1:29:41
When I finally went to the orthopedic surgeon and found out that this was
1:29:45
something hereditary that we had
1:29:50
the silent arthritis, it doesn’t start—because you can exercise and
1:29:55
then your knees they don’t hurt at all.
1:29:57
By the time—to make a long story short—by the time I was 40 years old I
1:30:00
had the knees of a 60-year-old woman.
1:30:03
I wore my knees out.
1:30:07
So, I ended up having the first two surgeries, oh yeah—because
1:30:11
my husband I we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in 2005,
1:30:18
so yeah, and that was the same year.
1:30:21
Because in December I turned 60.
1:30:24
So I had the surgery when I was 59, and so they, I had them do both of my knees.
1:30:30
They wouldn’t do them at the same time but they did them 6 weeks apart.
1:30:33
I had Kaiser for it, and they were too backed up.
1:30:38
They couldn’t do it, so they sent me up to OHSU.
1:30:40
I had both of my knees replaced.
1:30:42
I had the right one done in June of 2005, in June, and then the
1:30:48
left one was done in August.
1:30:50
They were 6 weeks apart that I had them done.
1:30:54
Then I ended up falling down my basement stairs in 2009, ruining this one.
1:31:01
I didn’t bust it up or anything but I messed it up, so I had to have
1:31:06
surgery done on this one again.
1:31:09
Then, I had a really bad fall at the Lloyd Center about almost 4 years ago.
1:31:14
I’m still trying to get through this.
1:31:16
But, broke the prosthesis in there in the left knee.
1:31:21
That was in 2016.
1:31:23
I’ve had this one done.
1:31:27
Both have had—I’ve had 4 knee replacements.
1:31:29
Those are some significant things in my life.
1:31:31
Then, with my husband’s cancer, that was a real significant thing
1:31:37
in my life and then losing my mom.
1:31:40
I lost my mom.
1:31:41
My husband was, I forgot this part—my mom passed away in 2007.
1:31:46
We don’t know when she was diagnosed, because, like I said, they didn’t talk
1:31:50
about anything that was wrong about them.
1:31:52
You found out after the fact when they can’t hardly move anymore.
1:31:57
They’re so sick and so, didn’t even know that she even had cancer.
1:32:03
Kind of like traumatized—my mom passes away.
1:32:07
My husband diagnosed in 2007, then one of my cousins, she had an aneurism.
1:32:14
Then I had another uncle that left.
1:32:17
Just significant things, losing and some of my, my uncle was younger than I was.
1:32:23
He had some kind of cancer.
1:32:26
I don’t even know what he had, what kind of cancer he had.
1:32:32
Then I lost one of my younger uncles, which was my grandmother’s.
1:32:35
My grandmother had an older set, which was my mother, my aunts, and
1:32:39
then she had a second set with her second husband and these were younger.
1:32:45
They’re younger than I am but they’re my aunts and my uncles.
1:32:50
Then I lost my mother’s other sister, Auntie LaLa.
1:32:55
She was the funny aunt in the family.
1:32:58
You know you have—I had two.
1:33:00
I had Auntie Sarah and Auntie LaLa.
1:33:02
Auntie LaLa, she was a character.
1:33:04
I mean, just feisty, fun, would talk to you about anything.
1:33:11
Anything you wanted to know about sex, men—anything you ask her.
1:33:16
She didn’t—she would just tell you.
1:33:18
Being younger, we just thought she was really cool.
1:33:21
And she was.
1:33:23
So, we lost her.
1:33:24
That was another great loss, because she was
1:33:29
the oldest matriarch left at that time.
1:33:31
We just lost her in 2015.
1:33:35
Then our uncle, the oldest uncle, Uncle Raymond, he’s the oldest patriarch now.
1:33:41
He’s, I think he just turned 87 and he’s dealing with cancer and
1:33:49
PAD, some other significant things.
1:33:51
I try to keep in touch with him.
1:33:53
I just called him out of the blue just to let him know that I love him and I’m
1:33:57
thinking about him, that kind of thing.
1:33:59
He’s really cool and he’s always really happy.
1:34:03
Then sometimes I’ll just text him just to see, because he’s older and
1:34:07
then sometimes he says he’ll forget to turn his phone on or turn it off.
1:34:12
He’ll turn it off and he’ll forget to turn it back on and that kind of thing.
1:34:16
I just, I’ll call him or either text him and just let him know that
1:34:20
I love him and that kind of thing.
1:34:22
We don’t talk a lot but I do try to keep in touch with him.
1:34:27
Those are some of the poignant, sad, and significant times in my life that
1:34:34
have just shaped me into who I am.
1:34:37
Right now I can say that I’m really happy with where I am in life.
1:34:41
I was in a relationship that I, for about, almost about 5 years,
1:34:46
and the person, I just figured out, okay, this isn’t going to work.
1:34:53
I’m 74 years old, I really don’t want to have to live this,
1:34:59
you know, be with this person if it’s not going to benefit both of us, because
1:35:05
sometimes you can get with someone and it makes you feel not really good
1:35:10
inside and causes you to react or do things that you’re working on hard not
1:35:17
to do anymore because this isn’t you.
1:35:20
You’re not there anymore.
1:35:21
You’re not like that.
1:35:24
It just didn’t work out.
1:35:25
I wish him well, and I do pray for him and that kind of thing, but I just
1:35:30
knew it wasn’t going to work for us.
1:35:31
I did try.
1:35:32
I did.
1:35:33
I did.
1:35:35
So, I’m happy.
1:35:37
Tell me what are the things that you do now for recreation?
1:35:41
I still exercise.
1:35:43
I have what you call, right over here, a whole-body vibration because I do have
1:35:48
knee replacement, so I just can’t do that.
1:35:52
I’m doing, right now I’m getting some chiropractic surgery, not
1:35:57
surgery, but chiropractic, she’s working on me with different
1:36:01
tools just in my back, lower back.
1:36:05
Then I have a physical therapist that I’m going to.
1:36:09
It’s really helped, because I love exercising, so I want to do it but
1:36:16
I want to learn how to do it in a way that’s going to be beneficial
1:36:20
for me so that I don’t hurt myself.
1:36:22
I still do exercise.
1:36:24
I go on trips and one of my younger cousins is getting married
1:36:32
in February.
1:36:32
Next month.
1:36:33
Right around the corner.
1:36:35
She’s getting married.
1:36:36
I already have my plane ticket.
1:36:37
I’m going to fly down to Los Vegas.
1:36:39
My brother is going to give her away.
1:36:43
We do a lot of different family things.
1:36:44
My oldest daughter, she has different things going on in her house.
1:36:48
One of my granddaughters just turned 26.
1:36:50
We just had a birthday party for her last Saturday.
1:36:53
That was a lot of fun.
1:36:54
Then, also, my cousin was having her bridal shower.
1:36:58
So, I had to go to that.
1:37:00
I went to both of those and it was just a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
1:37:04
I do things with my family, friends, and not just keep myself busy
1:37:11
but try to live life to the full.
1:37:14
So, what is it in your life?
1:37:17
What makes it full?
1:37:18
It makes it full, because one, number one, I have a relationship with the Lord.
1:37:22
He helps me spiritually, mentally, and emotionally and to know that
1:37:28
He’ll always be with me and that He’ll never leave me, nor forsake me.
1:37:32
That helps me to know that I have a foundation that I’m building on and I
1:37:37
can help others just to think about it.
1:37:41
Nobody’s, I’m not trying to do any religious stuff, because
1:37:44
for me, the relationship, I have a relationship with the Lord.
1:37:47
I don’t have a religious thing.
1:37:50
I have relationship.
1:37:51
It’s between me and Him.
1:37:56
Another one of the things that makes my life fullest, I don’t try to
1:37:59
change or make somebody into something that they’re not, or try to control.
1:38:03
I
1:38:05
know about control.
1:38:06
So, I just want people, just be you.
1:38:11
That’s who you need to be.
1:38:12
You don’t have to be like anyone else but you.
1:38:16
That’s it.
1:38:17
Don’t try to change because somebody’s trying to change you
1:38:19
because you’ll never be good enough if you let people try to control you.
1:38:23
You never will.
1:38:25
That’s one of the things that I don’t—my kids, they say, oh, momma, you so hard.
1:38:29
No, I’m not hard.
1:38:30
I just want you to be who you are and you have to let me be who I am,
1:38:35
because I’m not going to let you try to change me into what you think I should
1:38:39
be, because it’s not going to happen.
1:38:41
If that’s hard, then I’m hard.
1:38:44
Living life to the fullest just means loving people where they’re
1:38:48
at and not trying to change them and not letting them change you.
1:38:54
Be who you are and enjoy yourself.
1:38:55
I do.
1:38:57
I enjoy myself.
1:38:57
I enjoy other people, so for me that’s what it is, just knowing that
1:39:02
I’m loved and that I can love other people without wanting something
1:39:09
from them or trying to control them.
1:39:13
Tell us some things about your family traditions.
1:39:17
How do you celebrate Christmas and what holidays.
1:39:21
Well, you can tell us about the birthdays because I know you have a lot of those.
1:39:26
[Laughs] It’s a lot.
1:39:26
The birthdays are fun.
1:39:27
You know,
1:39:31
we do those.
1:39:32
I just had, my birthday, I was born December 7, 1945, so my kids are
1:39:37
always trying to do things for me.
1:39:39
My son, the youngest one, Alander, him and his girlfriend, they bought me a cake.
1:39:46
Since I’m really working on my health and that kind of thing, so I just, after they,
1:39:51
I made sure that I took the cake someplace else where other people could enjoy it.
1:39:55
That kind of thing.
1:39:59
Those are, just being with my family and thanking God that I have all
1:40:04
of my children with me and all of them, they’re all adults, and
1:40:09
just being able to see them and laugh with them and talk with them.
1:40:15
It’s just wonderful.
1:40:17
So, I’m just trying to live each day the best I can as if it might be my
1:40:22
last, because we don’t ever know.
1:40:24
I want to be able to leave a legacy of love.
1:40:28
I guess that’s what I’m saying, for myself and for my children, that they’ll
1:40:32
know that even though I might not have always agreed with my mom, she loved me.
1:40:38
And I loved her.
1:40:40
For me, love is really important and enjoying those holidays.
1:40:43
Holidays of Christmas, where my kids were growing up we always
1:40:48
opened a gift on Christmas Eve.
1:40:51
They got to open one gift.
1:40:52
I don’t know if that’s in most Black families or whatever.
1:40:56
I know a lot of African American, I know some Caucasian people do the same things:
1:41:00
you get to open one gift on Christmas Eve.
1:41:04
The kids always looked forward to that, and I did, too, my
1:41:06
husband I when he was alive.
1:41:09
Those are fun times.
1:41:10
The birthday parties, they’re really significant because
1:41:14
each one is a milestone.
1:41:14
We just, we do a lot of celebrating in my family.
1:41:14
Tell us,
1:41:21
you’re going to have all these birthday parties this weekend.
1:41:25
Yeah.
1:41:25
So, describe—you were telling me before we were recording, but describe for
1:41:33
each birthday party what is it going to be like and what are you doing for it?
1:41:39
I’m just showing up.
1:41:40
I don’t have to do anything, especially with my grandkids and my great
1:41:44
grandkids, they just want me there.
1:41:47
I don’t have to do anything, just be there and love on the kids and love on them
1:41:54
and they just say, Nana, you just come.
1:41:57
We don’t, they don’t ask for birthday presents.
1:42:02
They don’t ask for anything.
1:42:02
Usually, I give them money because usually you can always
1:42:06
get what you want with money.
1:42:07
I usually give them money and am just there.
1:42:10
What, how are they going to celebrate?
1:42:13
Usually, depending on
1:42:17
the kids.
1:42:18
Like, now the 4-year-old, Jordan, and their brother, they’re going
1:42:21
to have—I think they’re going to have the theme... they had a theme
1:42:25
last year, but I think the theme this year is, oh gosh, what is it?
1:42:29
She said it.
1:42:31
I think its Toy Story.
1:42:33
They want, if you can, you don’t have to, to dress up from the Toy Story characters.
1:42:41
That’s a significant thing.
1:42:44
Then,
1:42:46
my other, the other birthday party that I’m going to tonight.
1:42:49
This is my girlfriend, this is her granddaughter.
1:42:54
Her name is Fancy, and she is fancy.
1:42:59
She likes sparkly things, so my thing is I got to go, they say no birthday
1:43:05
presents, but you know, you have to, if you don’t do money you kind
1:43:10
of try to look at what they like.
1:43:12
So, I’m going to go and see if I can find her something sparkly, either a
1:43:16
sparkly hat, some sparkly shoes, or sparkly socks—whatever I can find, but
1:43:22
something with sparkles on it for her.
1:43:26
Her daughter is cooking dinner and so we don’t have to bring,
1:43:30
I don’t have to bring anything, like I said, because it’s all set.
1:43:34
They said no presents.
1:43:35
Daughter’s cooking, so just show up because we want to see you, because her
1:43:39
grandkids, they call me Auntie Veverly.
1:43:42
So, I’m their auntie.
1:43:47
Yeah, those two birthday parties.
1:43:48
Then the gumbo party is this Sunday.
1:43:52
I’m doing the gumbo.
1:43:54
Tell me more about the gumbo party.
1:43:55
Well, the gumbo is something I started doing some years back, and
1:44:00
so my mother had taught me how to do her gumbo originally, but she didn’t
1:44:07
give me all of the ingredients.
1:44:09
What she told me to do is to make the gumbo my own.
1:44:12
So, I have.
1:44:16
My friends just, they labeled me the gumbo queen.
1:44:19
That’s what I do.
1:44:22
I love doing the gumbo.
1:44:25
I’ve had to show them how to do it.
1:44:27
Tell us how.
1:44:30
Well, I can’t.
1:44:30
Some of my things are secret.
1:44:33
I mean, no, really, because my mom said make the thing your own.
1:44:36
Most people that do gumbo or whatever they’ll tell you.
1:44:38
They’re not going to give you all of their stuff.
1:44:41
They’re just not.
1:44:43
It’s a, you know, just like a sequence of events.
1:44:46
I’m here by myself.
1:44:48
I love being here and then I think that for me, my gumbo is just made with love.
1:44:55
I think that’s what really makes it really significant and different
1:44:59
because I love doing this for people and just look forward to serving them.
1:45:07
Everybody’s just having a good time.
1:45:10
I think my gumbo is made with love.
1:45:11
I’ll say that [laughs]
1:45:14
. Describe to me how you spent your last Christmas and how you celebrated.
1:45:21
Okay.
1:45:24
Last year we just—I had my Christmas tree.
1:45:29
My son, the one that’s 52, he is always getting me things that
1:45:35
I’ve asked him not to get me.
1:45:38
So, he bought me this, I don’t know, it’s an air fryer, a gigantic
1:45:44
air fryer, a gigantic juicer.
1:45:47
I mean, I live in a small apartment, so I ended up giving the fryer and
1:45:52
everything to my youngest daughter, because my oldest daughter had one.
1:45:58
I gave all of my kids, I gave them money.
1:46:01
I gave all of them money and then we celebrated.
1:46:05
They came, some of them,
1:46:09
my youngest son, his girlfriend and then my son that’s 52 and his
1:46:13
girlfriend they came over and they celebrated with me, because I had just
1:46:19
broken with the guy that I had been with off and on for 5 years in September.
1:46:26
I just called it quits.
1:46:29
They were thinking, and which I’m not lonely, because I’m not.
1:46:34
They just wanted to be with me.
1:46:35
So, I celebrated with my kids.
1:46:39
I had a really good Christmas.
1:46:41
They just came here.
1:46:43
It was just not a—
1:46:44
Yes.
1:46:44
Well, I had a couple of my...no,
1:46:49
that was my birthday.
1:46:50
I’m sorry.
1:46:50
No.
1:46:50
It was just the adults.
1:46:52
Just the adults.
1:46:53
What did you do to celebrate?
1:46:54
Well, we’d drink sparkling cider.
1:46:57
We’d sit around my table.
1:46:58
We’d giggle, we laughed, and they talked about some of the things
1:47:02
they did when they were younger, and we just had a good time just
1:47:06
enjoying one another, and eating.
1:47:09
I made, I did, no... that was for Thanksgiving.
1:47:13
I did a, I think I did a ham, Cornish game hens, dressing and
1:47:18
some other stuff for Christmas.
1:47:21
We had that.
1:47:22
It was just good.
1:47:24
We just enjoyed one another.
1:47:26
Describe more of that meal, if it’s not secret.
1:47:29
[Laughs] No, that’s not secret.
1:47:30
The meal was, I mean, I did the cooking and then
1:47:37
I do my giblet gravy, which they love.
1:47:40
I did that.
1:47:42
Then we had rolls and some other stuff.
1:47:46
Just good food and sometimes, you know, even if the food isn’t good, people
1:47:50
you know, you care about folks and so it just makes it just a wonderful
1:47:56
time to be with each other, because you’re building each other up and
1:48:00
helping each other hopefully to become better and to love one another better.
1:48:05
We just had a good time just being with one another.
1:48:07
I think that’s what made it a real special Christmas for me and for my family.
1:48:13
Was that on Christmas day?
1:48:15
That was Christmas day.
1:48:17
What about Christmas Eve?
1:48:18
What did you do?
1:48:19
I think.... what did I do?
1:48:21
Oh, I went over to my oldest daughter’s house because I had things for the kids.
1:48:27
I took, so on Christmas Eve because
1:48:31
they were brought up where we would do one gift on Christmas Eve.
1:48:35
I took all the gifts over that I had for my grandchildren, my great grandchildren.
1:48:40
I took all of their gifts.
1:48:42
I gave money to all of my children, but I bought gifts for the great grandchildren
1:48:47
that are there, and my granddaughter.
1:48:48
So, I did pajamas last year.
1:48:51
Pajamas are always good.
1:48:53
They’re good.
1:48:53
I did pajamas and gowns for everybody.
1:48:57
That
1:48:59
was really good.
1:48:59
Then
1:49:04
on Christmas Eve, do you have special food?
1:49:05
Usually they do.
1:49:05
Usually on Christmas Eve I don’t have to cook because, well, I was
1:49:07
cooking dinner for here, but my oldest daughter she usually does more like
1:49:13
Hors d’oeuvres and just, you know, light things and that kind of thing for
1:49:18
Christmas Eve, because they’re going to have the big dinner on Christmas day.
1:49:25
I went over to her house, like I said, took all the presents
1:49:27
there and then so we had food and stuff there that she had made.
1:49:30
It was like, she does a lot of chicken, fish, she does a really good fish fry.
1:49:38
Then I think we had salad, fruit bowls, and that kind of stuff.
1:49:45
It was really nice.
1:49:46
It wasn’t really heavy food, but it was nice.
1:49:49
And we dance a lot in our family [laughs] . I do.
1:49:54
I love dancing.
1:49:55
We dance a lot.
1:49:57
Yeah, we dance a lot.
1:49:59
What kind of music?
1:50:01
I really like jazz, because I’ve been to a lot of different jazz concerts.
1:50:05
Oh, and another thing, my baby sister lives up in Seattle.
1:50:08
Let me get this in first.
1:50:09
So, my baby sister lives up in Seattle.
1:50:13
I go up there quite often.
1:50:14
I take the train, and so that’s another, one of my outlets.
1:50:17
We visit one another.
1:50:19
She’s into, she’s not completely vegan because she eats shrimp and fish and
1:50:25
that kind of stuff, but she has gone doing the vegetarian type of stuff.
1:50:30
She eats veggies and fish and chicken and that kind of stuff, all the organic stuff.
1:50:34
So, I go up there and I visit her and we just have so much fun together.
1:50:40
She has a doggy named Cody.
1:50:42
I love Cody.
1:50:44
He is, that’s my nephew, little Cody.
1:50:46
He is a cute dog.
1:50:47
I do that.
1:50:51
Like I said, for, what is it?
1:50:54
For Christmas Eve with my daughter, oldest daughter and her son and daughter
1:51:01
and his girlfriend and their children.
1:51:05
We did that.
1:51:07
That was good.
1:51:08
Christmas day, just family, you know?
1:51:13
Talked with my, I have 2 best friends: Carla, the one I was telling you
1:51:16
about earlier, who’s Caucasian.
1:51:18
I’ve known her for over 30 years.
1:51:20
Then my other friend, Fran, I’ve known her for about 28 years.
1:51:24
We keep in touch.
1:51:24
We don’t talk every day, but we do speak to each other.
1:51:27
We giggle and laugh a lot, and we dance.
1:51:30
When I go to her house tonight, we’re going to be dancing.
1:51:34
I’m already, I’m waiting for that.
1:51:37
It’s going to be a lot of fun.
1:51:41
What about in your family when you have all your children and you were living
1:51:45
with your husband and had all the children, what did you do on Christmas?
1:51:51
We did kind of the same things.
1:51:53
We always—I always cooked and then during that time there was a span
1:51:59
of time when my oldest daughter and I, we were kind of estranged.
1:52:04
We really didn’t see each other that much.
1:52:07
There were some different things going on with her, I think.
1:52:09
I call it the change of life, because sometimes it can send
1:52:14
people off and different things.
1:52:15
I kind of had a breaking point with her during that time.
1:52:19
I just let her do her thing and she finally went to the doctor and got some
1:52:23
medicine, then we came back together.
1:52:27
We were good, but when my husband and I, when he was alive, we just
1:52:32
really went all out for our kids.
1:52:35
He has 2 other children that they lived in Texas.
1:52:39
We would always, when we would, whatever we bought for our kids that were here,
1:52:43
we made sure that the kids that were in Texas, his two kids that were in Texas,
1:52:46
they were well taken care of, too.
1:52:48
We sent them money, clothes, toys, whatever, because we both had good jobs.
1:52:53
So, yeah.
1:52:55
So, did Santa Clause come?
1:52:57
Yeah.
1:52:58
All, the whole thing.
1:53:01
The whole thing.
1:53:03
Okay.
1:53:07
Really, we just now have a closing question.
1:53:11
Sure, okay.
1:53:17
What, when you look back at your life, stands out most in your mind?
1:53:24
As far as, just anything?
1:53:27
Anything,
1:53:33
and maybe what would have—yeah, I’ll leave it at that.
1:53:39
Well, I think mostly I think what really stands out is there’s maybe,
1:53:46
like I said, 2 or 3 things, my mom, some of the different things
1:53:50
that she taught me, and my brother.
1:53:53
Those are real significant and helped shape me.
1:53:58
Also, my first husband.
1:54:03
He really shaped, because of the way he was brought up, it really
1:54:09
affected my life and then also
1:54:15
my second husband.
1:54:17
He was a real, he was an advocate for me.
1:54:20
He didn’t realize it then.
1:54:23
We got to talk about it.
1:54:26
A lot of different things before he passed away.
1:54:31
He really helped me a lot to see
1:54:36
death and dying in a different way—that you really don’t have to be afraid and
1:54:43
he, it was a joy, even though I was still working for Friends of the Children
1:54:48
when he was ill before he passed away, he made such an impact on my life.
1:54:54
I think I remember.
1:54:56
I know I did, I didn’t think.
1:54:57
I asked him a question and I had to get—I brought him home.
1:55:03
He died at home.
1:55:05
So, I was talking to him about it and he just, I said, I just don’t understand
1:55:13
why God let you, why did you get this?
1:55:15
Why did you have to have?
1:55:15
Why do you have to leave me?
1:55:21
I just, when I said why?
1:55:22
He said, why not?
1:55:23
Why not me?
1:55:26
It made me think about, even though I had been thinking about life, it just
1:55:31
made me think about life from a different perspective, that it’s all how you
1:55:36
perceive things, how you look at them.
1:55:40
How do you, are you leaving a good legacy for your children?
1:55:45
For your family?
1:55:46
For your friends?
1:55:49
What kind of impact are you making just where you’re at?
1:55:53
It can be significant or very small.
1:55:56
He made me think about those things.
1:55:59
My other two friends, Carla and Fran, they’ve been real instrumental in my
1:56:05
life, those two women, to help me, that you can tell people things and
1:56:11
they’ll keep your secrets and really they’re not secrets but they’ll keep
1:56:15
your confidence is what I should say.
1:56:17
When you tell them something, it stays with them and they can feel the same way
1:56:20
about me, that when they tell me something that is significant in their lives it’s
1:56:26
going to stay and not go anyplace else.
1:56:32
What would you say were the best parts
1:56:36
and the not so good parts?
1:56:39
Well those, that I just described, some of those were good and some of them were bad.
1:56:42
The not so good parts, I think was when I had to watch my
1:56:46
husband and then my mother, both of them, they both died at home.
1:56:53
So, those were hard.
1:56:54
Those were, they made some real deep, a real deep impact on my life.
1:57:03
Then, I also watched my aunt.
1:57:05
She died at home.
1:57:07
She made a real impact on my life.
1:57:09
I asked her did she know the Lord before she left.
1:57:13
She told me yes.
1:57:13
I know Jesus.
1:57:16
That was really important for me.
1:57:18
My mom also and my husband did.
1:57:24
Those were some really significant things in my life and
1:57:29
they’ve kept me going.
1:57:31
Just thinking about them as some of the, after I got over a lot of the grief, then
1:57:38
I was able to think about my aunt, some of the funny things she would say, some of
1:57:41
the funny things my mom would say, some of the funny things my husband said and did.
1:57:48
He had
1:57:51
a, it wasn’t weird, but he had a funny sense of humor.
1:57:55
He would just say things that were just so, I mean it was more so
1:58:00
for him and I, and then sometimes in public or with our friends.
1:58:04
I’d say not in public, but with our friends.
1:58:07
Just remembering some of those things
1:58:11
made me just think about that things are going to be okay.
1:58:16
They will be.
1:58:16
And they are.
1:58:18
They’re okay.
1:58:20
I’m just very thankful
1:58:25
that I’ve had a chance to share with you guys and thank you, you know, so
1:58:30
much for calling me and letting me know that this is something that I could do.
1:58:34
This is actually my second video that I’ve done.
1:58:39
I did one at Jefferson High School.
1:58:42
We talked about some of the things that happened when I was in high
1:58:46
school, and that was really good.
1:58:49
I got to pair with a student.
1:58:51
He got to interview me the way you’re doing.
1:58:57
I think I’m in their archives or whatever.
1:59:00
That was really good.
1:59:01
But it was just talking about the impact of when I was at Jefferson
1:59:07
High School and kind of like they were talking about racism also.
1:59:14
That was really good.
1:59:16
I’m just thankful that these things are coming into my life and so I
1:59:21
don’t know where exactly, I think you told me where it’s going to be,
1:59:24
but I don’t recall it right now, but I’m glad that I was able to do this.
1:59:30
I’m glad that you guys were able to come and hear my story.
