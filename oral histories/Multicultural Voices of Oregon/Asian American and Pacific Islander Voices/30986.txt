00:01
My name is Natalia Fernández; I am the Oregon Multicultural librarian,
00:05
a staff member with OSU’s Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:10
Today’s date is May 21, 2014, and I am interviewing Maiyee Yuan a staff
00:17
member of the Asian and Pacific Cultural Center at Oregon State University.
00:22
So if you can state your name and spell it out loud:
00:25
My name is Maiyee Yuan and its spelled M-A-I-Y-E-E Y-U-A-N
00:34
Okay, and can you state what your home town is?
00:38
Or where “home” is for you?
00:41
I was born in and raised in Salem, Oregon.
00:45
And what is your age, year in school, and major?
00:49
I am currently 20 and it’s my 3rd year at Oregon State,
00:55
with a major of microbiology.
00:58
And what are your self-identities in terms of race and ethnicity?
01:03
I identify myself as Chinese-American.
01:08
And so in terms of your work at the APCC: what is your position,
01:12
so what do you do and how many years have you worked for the APCC?
01:15
I have worked here at the APCC for two years now, my first year was
01:22
as a office assistant or office support, as it was called at the time.
01:28
And in that position I planned with a group of four people various events and
01:37
also various tasks around the center such has program database entry, managing
01:43
the list serve, and things like that to keep the center up and running.
01:48
And then this year I was working as the internal coordinator for the Asian
01:53
and Pacific Cultural Center where my tasks definitely increased a lot more.
01:58
I, overall, advised the current cultural center coordinators who
02:05
do something, who had similar tasks as me when I was in office support.
02:11
And in addition to attending the APA council meetings where 18 to 19 Pan-Asian,
02:22
Pacific Islander American, and Greek life organizations all met together to
02:29
plan various events throughout the term, and I also managed the center’s email.
02:36
Also like keeping track of various documentation that are needed for
02:42
events and various purchase requests.
02:44
So a lot of like in-center management.
02:49
Great, and what drew you to that position in particular?
02:53
Why did you apply to that one?
02:55
I have a really, I have a sense of home here at the APCC, and I wanted
03:05
to be able to be in a position to
03:11
spread awareness and create an environment where other people can also feel like
03:15
it is home and in my previous position I feel like I was still kind of working
03:23
within some boundaries; I was hoping that as internal coordinator I could work
03:29
at a high level with the administration with the students as well and kind of
03:35
pervade that connection between the two groups and to kind of bridge that
03:41
gap and form this new innovative and…
03:49
I don’t know where I was going with that [laughs]
03:49
That’s okay, so have you worked with any of the other cultural
03:53
centers or just the APCC?
03:55
I only worked for the APCC.
03:57
And why did you initially work with the APCC when you applied
04:01
to be an office support person.
04:05
I initially applied because I felt like at the APCC there was this unique sense
04:12
of warmth and of welcoming that was really nice that I wish I could be a
04:19
part of and then also there was so much opportunity in that position as well to
04:26
grow as a leader and grow as a person who could understand more about the
04:30
issues surrounding like the Asian and Pacific Islander community and it just,
04:35
really it attracted me because I feel like I have grown also as being a public
04:41
speaker and also a person that would interact with other people while doing
04:47
greetings, making speeches, giving tours.
04:51
So I am really glad that I took on the position because I feel
04:56
like I have gained a lot from it.
04:59
So you have talked about this a little bit, but what were your expectations,
05:02
your hopes for your work here and were they matched, surpassed, not matched?
05:09
I have to say that a lot of times my expectations were not, how do you say,
05:17
that were not completely fulfilled, but at the same time there were things
05:21
I weren’t expecting that I gained.
05:24
I was hoping that by working here I would be super insightful about all
05:30
the issues affecting like Asian and Pacific Islander communities but I soon
05:35
realized that it was very difficult and it wasn’t as easy as it seemed.
05:40
But at the same time it provided me a lot of opportunity to
05:44
find out about these issues.
05:47
So I think, for me, it was just creating that culture of wanting to
05:53
know, wanting to find out, and being able to attend conferences such as
05:58
the Oregon students, what is it OSOC?
06:03
Oregon Student Association of Color…Something along the
06:08
lines, sorry for the quote.
06:10
And
06:12
also we recently attended the Asian Pacific Desi Islander…wait, Asian
06:26
Desi Pacific Islander American Freedom School where we were able to learn
06:33
about the identities and the various issues surrounding the communities.
06:39
So I think it was really great being able to fulfil my expectations, but
06:46
I feel like at the same time I had to put in the effort as well to be
06:51
willing to learn about these things.
06:54
And were these conferences here in Oregon or were they national?
06:58
They were Oregon conferences, and I feel really grateful because through
07:03
my understanding of various processes around funding and the school system,
07:11
I was - I understood the department sponsored us to go to these conferences
07:17
so I am really grateful for the opportunities otherwise I probably
07:21
wouldn’t even know or even attend these.
07:24
And you attended these conferences with the other staff members here at the APCC?
07:27
Yeah, conferences are totally optional, so those who are interested are those who
07:33
do happen to have the time - you know with sign up, we would let the people know and
07:40
arrange rides and whatever else we need.
07:42
That’s wonderful.
07:43
So can you describe some of the projects, events, activities over
07:49
the past of the two years that were especially meaningful to you?
07:55
For me I feel like one of the first events that I would say that I planned
08:03
a major part of would be our open house
08:09
at the beginning of this year.
08:11
Because over the summer - well open house occurs literally the first week of
08:17
school and so over the summer I was the only one working at the Asian and Pacific
08:23
Cultural Center where I had to look through past records and I had to organize
08:30
program and I felt like that was a time where I really grew and I really grew to
08:37
appreciate all the records that were kept from past coordinators as well because
08:43
they really helped me in understanding that in the past it really helps us
08:47
plan for the future in that sense.
08:49
But also event planning isn’t easy and we can kind of get lost in it
08:55
sometimes as students to balance our work and our school work and
09:00
also our extracurricular as well.
09:04
And then another one I felt like, was really important to me was, I didn’t
09:14
personally plan this one but this was an event that occurred last term called
09:21
“Asian and Pacific Islanders in the Media” and this was an event that I
09:26
was working with the cultural center coordinators with. They wanted to do an
09:33
event where it wasn’t just socializing and having fun or serving food.
09:39
So we targeted the portrayal of certain stereotypes surrounding Asian
09:47
and Pacific Islanders communities and how prevalent in like Hollywood or
09:52
even on TV shows, things like that.
09:57
And I feel like at this moment I felt as a leader and as someone who
10:04
is supporting our new staff members I felt at that moment like there
10:11
was this evolution of leadership and being able to target certain issues
10:19
that aren’t quite talked about a lot that need to be in our line of work.
10:26
Great, anything else?
10:31
I would say pretty much all of our events, I want to highlight all of them
10:36
and bring out the giant binder right now but at the same time it’s really
10:43
hard to pinpoint all of the events that were like, significant to me because
10:51
everybody puts in so much hard work onto their events and its crazy how in
10:57
as little as an hour or two it’s over and then you move on to the next thing.
11:03
About how many events on average would you say you do per term?
11:08
Per term?
11:10
Or per month if that’s easier to count.
11:15
I would say, okay, so event coordinators have to plan two per coordinator
11:22
that makes four and then two for the outreaches as well that makes six,
11:31
and then one for the cultural center coordinators - so I would say we have
11:38
about seven to nine events per term.
11:42
But especially during spring term and our heritage month of
11:46
May we have as much as twelve.
11:50
So I know that a lot of times these events are collaborations ‘cause we
11:56
want to show community, we want to show solidarity to everybody at OSU,
12:03
and also communities outside as well.
12:05
So I am really amazed and proud of everybody who has like,
12:11
put in the work and who make
12:17
all these events such a success.
12:19
Great, so what have been some of your challenges working at the APCC
12:24
and how have you overcome them?
12:28
I have to say, even now, there’s a lot of, I don’t want to say disorganization,
12:36
but a lack of records perhaps?
12:39
Though we have archives it’s mostly stuff we do based on media such as
12:46
photography or flyers or crafts.
12:49
So a lot of that history of like the actual event planning and the contacts
12:57
or the semantics of you know, that come through experience such as when
13:04
is the best time to host an event what location to people pass by more.
13:09
It’s lost though every year because there is a hiring process that occurs and since
13:16
the staff have been traditionally all student based, a lot of the experiences
13:23
were not recorded in the past but thank goodness we have Reagan now who
13:29
is our professional staff at APCC.
13:32
So we hope that with that position will retain the records more and have
13:37
more consistency from year to year.
13:40
But also I have made a lot of changes this year on keeping track of forms, keeping
13:47
track of idea sheets, so that future maybe they can look back and see what went
13:55
well what didn’t go well and hopefully become more innovative as the years go on.
14:02
So in addition to the great projects and events that you have
14:06
done, what do you consider your successes working at the APCC?
14:12
I have to say a lot of times the successes are definitely not my own, it’s
14:18
definitely a group effort and for me I feel like just having more people who
14:25
are interested in working here at the APCC, more people who are visiting who
14:31
have never been to the center before.
14:33
So just gaining more exposure and also for our new building to be
14:37
moving to a more central location on campus - I feel like it’s really great
14:42
in getting our purpose out there and fulfilling our goals as a the Asian
14:48
and Pacific Cultural Center as well.
14:52
Can you describe some of your interactions with staff from
14:56
the other cultural centers?
14:59
Well here is several ways that we interact both on a professional and professional
15:08
colleague basis versus a friend basis.
15:12
So I am really glad we have separate cultural resource centers ‘cause
15:18
it helps highlight the issues and
15:23
I guess the struggles that each community faces.
15:27
But at the same time its hard building those connections between
15:32
these communities as well as if someone has overlapping identities
15:38
to be able to acom-, not accommodate but to cater to all the people
15:44
and their different backgrounds.
15:47
But for me, we have weekly
15:54
- we have monthly
15:57
coordinator meetings where all the internal and external coordinators
16:02
in addition to the graduate teaching assistants and the now professional
16:07
staff of all the cultural resource centers come together and we meet
16:12
about an hour or two and discuss about things that are going on throughout
16:17
our centers and about upcoming projects
16:23
that we might want to collaborate on.
16:26
And
16:29
for me I work at the APCC and I want people to come in and I want people to
16:34
visit so I try to do the same for the other cultural resource centers - to
16:40
drop in to say hi to see how things are going; I think a little goes a long way.
16:45
And Just to see somebody, I identify solely as Chinese American but to see
16:53
somebody who is, does not identify
17:00
with certain labels associated with the center to come in I feel is very,
17:08
I guess it’s just a very liberating feeling to have people know that
17:12
you don’t have to identify a certain way to come and visit.
17:19
And yeah, like if we see each other around campus its very causal relationship.
17:28
It doesn’t feel like it’s very restricted to like work or anything like that.
17:36
Great, so let’s talk about the new center.
17:40
So the APCC will be moving and you just had the groundbreaking earlier this term.
17:47
So can you talk about, if you were involved in any of the design process or
17:53
the groundbreaking ceremony or anything you had to do with the new center?
18:00
The design for the new center was actually determined probably throughout
18:06
a span of, I don’t know like five plus years so I unfortunately did not have
18:14
much of the plan in the blueprints.
18:17
However, after working here at the APCC, I have been working on a lot of
18:23
efforts in getting the new center up.
18:25
So I know we had a little run in with the historical district and the building
18:32
of about a year ago.
18:34
And so there was an appeal to
18:40
I guess pass the design of our center.
18:44
From what I understand there was an issue with building within a historical
18:47
district but not accommodating to the current buildings that are there.
18:55
So making the APCC, or making a new building that looks like, that is
19:01
cohesive to the rest of the buildings that are already present and one of the
19:05
exceptions we had to have a cultural that had to have cultural relevance.
19:14
And so I guess the issue with our design was that it was not as culturally
19:20
relevant as it could be, so our great architects like redesigned a little
19:29
bit drawing inspirations drawing from all, you know all the thousands and
19:34
hundreds of cultures and islands.
19:39
And we got that passed fortunately and as for the groundbreaking that happened,
19:46
I was actually the master of ceremonies, and I am really grateful for all the
19:51
speakers we invited and that were willing to speak at the groundbreaking.
19:59
And as for the grand opening unfortunately, I will not be part of
20:05
the planning committee for that however I am passing on as much knowledge as
20:11
I have for the groundbreaking to the next years liaisons or next year’s
20:17
coordinators in hopes that it will be as great as the one we just had.
20:23
So what does the new center mean to you?
20:28
That is a big question [laughs] , I guess first and foremost I feel like
20:35
the location and just the presence of the new center will attract a lot
20:40
of attention and will create a lot of awareness so I feel it would definitely
20:45
help us fulfill out goals a lot easier being in a more central location.
20:51
And the new center also means that the hopes and the work of all those before
21:00
me are finally coming true and often times these projects start off as an idea
21:07
between a couple people but it shows that if people rally together, if we create a
21:14
culture under which we support all these diverse communities that are present,
21:21
that a lot of great things can happen.
21:23
So I feel like this new center will provide
21:28
definitely a space for those who have been coming APCC and who use
21:33
APCC but also provide a horizon under which a new population can
21:42
become aware and utilize this space.
21:49
So in terms of your ideas for the future and the bigger picture.
21:53
What projects, events, activities would you have liked to have seen
21:58
or would recommend for the future?
22:03
I think that with our projects, events, and activities, we definitely
22:10
hold a lot throughout the year.
22:16
And
22:19
I just want to gain more publicity and at the same time I want to
22:24
see more events targeted around
22:29
current issues that are surrounding the Asian and Pacific Islander community
22:34
because though we hold a lot of fun events throughout the term, the
22:40
attendance of those who are, of those events that are less I guess food
22:47
centered, those have lower turn outs.
22:52
So I definitely want to see more of these events and more
22:58
participation of these events.
23:03
I also want similar events in which
23:07
the different organizations all around campus come together and not just for
23:15
tabling to hold an organization fair but just something that all the organizations
23:21
can come together and mingle and then show support and community with one another.
23:30
And so what advice would you give to future APCC staff or OSU
23:35
cultural center staff in general?
23:38
I think that I try to live by is to lead by example so, truthfully I think that
23:48
if you work at the APCC or any of the cultural resource centers, it is important
23:53
to be passionate about your work or passionate about the cultural resource
24:00
center because it really reflects through your programming and through your everyday
24:05
interactions with people who come.
24:08
And I want them to know that though Corvallis is a secluded town that they are
24:17
not alone in their efforts; there are many organizations out there who are working
24:21
towards the same goals as us and that
24:27
as time goes on, we can only grow stronger.
24:33
And based on working here at the APCC, what is the takeaway that you have gained
24:39
that you would like to share with others?
24:46
I would like to say that
24:49
working here has given me a lot of insight on the processes of the organization.
24:57
So a lot of times I remember being very
25:05
disgruntled maybe with some of the programming with the organization but
25:12
after being in the system you realize the regulations and you know all the
25:17
policies that are restricting you.
25:19
So I think that for me it was just that before I form a judgment, I will
25:27
always try to get more information on it first so I guess my takeaway
25:33
would be to understand before you act.
25:37
So yeah, definitely.
25:41
And what would you say is the biggest issues in terms of the purpose of
25:47
the APCC and why it is so important?
25:55
I feel like the biggest issue in terms of the purpose would be that it’s such
26:03
a wide community to cater to and to serve because just in Asia alone I don’t
26:13
even know how many cultures there are.
26:17
And then even more different dialects and so just building
26:22
that communication, building the
26:26
support and the network of all these different students and also all
26:32
the student groups at OSU that are formed around these communities.
26:44
It’s just so much to cover because we try to hold events and we try to inform those
26:51
who are less knowledgeable about Asian and Pacific Islander culture, but at the same
26:57
time we want to hold events for those who are more knowledgeable so that there can
27:03
be greater discussion or understanding in addition to reaching out to the
27:12
international communities and the older generations take - how is that called?
27:19
latter education of those who do not come to college straight out
27:25
of high school and also veterans.
27:28
So there is a lot of communities we try to outreach and serve, but at the same time
27:34
it’s hard to spread ourselves that thin.
27:39
I would say that that is one of the biggest issues of operation.
27:45
And how would you describe the impact of the APCC on Asian
27:49
and Pacific Islander students?
27:54
I think that the APCC provides a space where a lot of Asian and Pacific Islander
27:59
students can come and feel like they are a part of the larger community
28:06
because like I said before, there are a lot of Asian and Pacific Islander
28:10
groups on campus, but none of them have a designated space from the university.
28:16
So I feel like
28:20
the Asian and Pacific Cultural Center provides an area where people can come
28:28
and they can hold their group meetings or they can just come on their spare time
28:32
and hang out with people who would like to interact with them and I feel like it’s
28:40
just a safe space where people can come.
28:46
And how would you describe the impact of the APCC on OSU and local community?
28:56
I feel like the APCC, again, provides a more central location for people to
29:05
congregate but also as a face for those who are interested in reaching out as
29:11
well – so a kind of central exchange point for those who are interested
29:16
in acquiring about the API community here at OSU or vice versa of like
29:23
the OSU community trying to find out more about the community, so you kind
29:27
of act as a liaison between the two.
29:31
And I feel like it provides like a voice or presence within OSU and the
29:37
community to show that we are here, and that we are here to share, we are
29:45
here to have our voices heard, and that we are here to build relationships
29:51
with one another and to move forward.
29:56
And can you describe and suggestions that you may have for future collaboration
30:01
with the OSU and local community?
30:08
There is a lot that we could do considering all the different legislation
30:14
that is going through about the economy, about the environment, and
30:19
about this building community with one another, so I guess I would say
30:29
I am really open to all different ideas because I believe that all the
30:35
different communities even though they are labeled different things,
30:38
there are parallels between everyone so having an open mind really helps
30:47
us be innovated and build this greater support system for one another.
30:56
Can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories is
31:01
important to your identity, if it is?
31:05
Yeah definitely I feel that sharing my story I hope at
31:11
least, it will help somebody else
31:15
feel closer to the Asian and Pacific Cultural Center or if
31:19
not, finding it relatable so they can help with their own path.
31:25
Because even throughout history, like generations through generations, we are
31:30
not given textbooks by our parents about how they lived - it’s like stories and
31:35
oral histories about how they lived.
31:36
And So I feel like having that human voice and hearing that somebody else
31:41
experienced these things really helps
31:47
other people find it relatable and to have that passed on for I don’t
31:55
know how long, like a very long time.
32:00
And thinking about your experiences here at OSU, can you describe your general
32:06
experiences whether it be personal or what you have observed on campus pertaining
32:11
to your racial or ethnic identities?
32:19
I feel like at OSU it’s a majority white campus so having these cultural
32:25
resource centers is important to show, to give a voice to the minorities, and
32:35
to give us power here at our campus and a stake hold.
32:39
So for me I feel like a lot of times being, identifying as female and
32:46
Asian that a lot of times in the stereotypes and the power structures,
32:52
I am seen as not very intimating or not much of a leadership role, but
33:03
I feel through the different programming that we have and the different workshops
33:08
and just having the exposure to different types of people from different types of
33:13
backgrounds, it really helps to dispel these different stereotypes whether be
33:19
they conscious or subconscious so I am really glad that we are diversifying
33:25
but I feel like there is definitely a lot more work that can be done too.
33:30
So is there anything that we have not discussed that you would like to add or
33:34
any information that you would want to go back and talk about a little bit more?
33:40
No I think it was pretty compressive, thank you very much.
