00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández.
00:05
I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian, a staff member with OSU Special
00:09
Collections & Archives Research Center.
00:11
Today’s date is May 20, 2014, and I am interviewing Mandi Suzuki, a staff
00:18
member of the Asian & Pacific Cultural Center at Oregon State University.
00:23
So if you could state your name and spell it out loud to get us started?
00:28
My name Mandilyn Suzuki.
00:38
And what is your hometown or where is “home” for you?
00:42
My hometown is Waipahu, Hawai’i.
00:45
I actually grew up in Pearl City though, but I would call Hawai’i my home.
00:52
What is your age, year in school and major?
00:56
I am 22, I am a fifth year, so this is my victory lap.
01:02
My major is general science with an option in pre-physical therapy.
01:08
What are your self-identities in terms of race and ethnicity?
01:13
I identify as Asian American.
01:16
Ethnicity wise I would consider myself Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino.
01:21
What is your position at the APCC, what do you do and how
01:26
many years have you worked here?
01:29
My position is the external coordinator.
01:33
As an external, I outreach to the community, I provide guidance and
01:37
support to the support staff on site.
01:41
There is five support staff, we have various positions, we have activities,
01:47
we have the community outreach, we have publications, and now we
01:50
have an academic success position.
01:53
So I overlook the support staff, I provide guidance, I provide any type of
01:59
resources they may need to be successful in their events, and this actually
02:04
my third year working at the APCC.
02:08
What were some of your other positions when you first started?
02:12
My first year, my third year in school, was actually office assistant
02:19
and I moved up to be community outreach to fill the position.
02:24
Then last year I was community outreach one more time, I felt like I didn’t fully
02:29
get to do all the events I wanted to, so I came back filled that position again.
02:35
Is it typical to start off as an office assistant with a new center?
02:39
I think so; it helps up to kind of gain experience in the center,
02:46
along with what we are hoping to advocate for, to kind of gain that
02:51
sense of awareness and education.
02:56
Personally jumping into an activities position was a little difficult, I
03:00
had weave around the whole just how to plan the event in a timely schedule.
03:05
Initially that was really difficult, I would say being an office assistant
03:11
definitely helps because you get to see the other activities coordinate and plan
03:15
their events and you can kind of learn and move up as you go through school.
03:20
Have you worked for any of the other cultural centers or did you
03:25
choose the APCC and you’ve just worked here for the past few years?
03:28
I just chose the APCC; I’ve been here for the past three years.
03:32
Why did you decide to work here?
03:35
I wanted to be in student leadership, development kind of position, I wanted
03:39
to outreach to students, I wanted to be a type of support network.
03:44
I actually applied to career services that same year.
03:54
I think, now that I think that back, that I didn’t get the
03:56
position at career services, that was actually my first choices, but
03:59
because I didn’t, I ended up here.
04:03
I think a lot of the opportunities that I didn’t realize came from this position.
04:11
That’s why I chose to come here, I wanted to work with students, I wanted to
04:15
interact with students, I just wanted to kind of further develop my interpersonal
04:19
skills, along with my leadership skills.
04:23
What were your expectations, your hopes, and were those
04:27
matched, surpassed, not matched?
04:29
I think it was definitely surpassed.
04:32
I didn’t really know what I was getting into.
04:36
When I came to the center, I knew what the centers were for, as like a support
04:41
system, but not quite the extent of what each activities coordinator did, and so
04:50
when I came in, I didn’t have very many expectations, but working with a team,
04:55
developing those relationships definitely surpassed anything that I ever imagined.
05:02
When you decided to work here, the first few years you were
05:06
here, did you attend events at the APCC and other cultural centers?
05:10
Is that how you found out about them?
05:12
Yes.
05:14
My sophomore year I actually worked with Aunty Sandy, and she kind
05:18
of got me connected to the APCC.
05:21
I was an officer for a Hawai’i Club, so we had events at the APCC, so that’s
05:26
where I started to get my familiarity with the center, and I knew when they
05:32
were looking for positions, I figured it would be a good opportunity.
05:36
Can you describe the projects, events, activities that you’ve worked on over
05:43
this past year during fall term, winter term, and spring term, and ones that
05:47
were especially meaningful to you?
05:50
Definitely, I actually haven’t had any events this year as an external,
05:56
I was more of a guidance support network for my support staff.
06:02
As a community outreach we did, or we had a goal to have an all
06:08
center collaboration every term.
06:11
My first year I worked here we actually had a lantern making, all center collab.
06:18
for World AIDS Day and we actually got to hang those lanterns
06:22
in the Trysting Tree Lounge.
06:24
That was a lot of fun.
06:27
My first event was actually during Queer History Month
06:32
and we had a panel of faculty, staff, students that were of color and they
06:39
were also, they identified as homosexual.
06:43
To me that was a very interesting first event coming from a Catholic background,
06:52
I was very conservative coming into college so I wasn’t very exposed to those
06:57
types of discussions and conversations.
07:00
I think that was kind of the starting point to where I wanted my events to go.
07:06
In winter term we had an event, Expressions of Love, it was
07:10
another all center collab.
07:12
We did a lot of outreaching to students.
07:14
It was very passive, it was to let students know we were there to support,
07:19
but it was really nice being able to work with the other centers and to see
07:24
us come together and provide this type of support system for other students.
07:31
That sounds wonderful.
07:32
So as the external coordinator this year, do you mostly, you mentioned
07:40
that you support, so do you mostly assist if a communities person with
07:45
that position, or another activities coordinator’s assistants, do you
07:49
help them out with their projects?
07:51
Yes, and I also used to go to tabling events to outreach to different
07:58
resources on campus, whether that would be other organizations or just
08:02
different departments on campus.
08:04
It could be ASOSU, it could be academic departments, and then having those
08:10
networks to provide to my activities coordinators if they should have an event
08:17
where they need a certain professor, or
08:20
a certain academic department they are looking for as to collaborate
08:23
with, I could provide those networks.
08:26
So you act as a networking mechanism, as a liaison in a way?
08:30
Yes, definitely.
08:32
Wonderful.
08:34
What have been your challenges working at the APCC and how have you overcome them?
08:38
Since you’ve been here many years, you can talk about a specific year
08:43
or your experiences as a whole or how you had challenges and maybe
08:46
they’ve changed over the years?
08:49
I think one of the biggest challenges, and I think this goes for all the
08:53
cultural centers, is advertisement and getting students to come to
08:59
events, as well as their interest.
09:01
I know what we advocate for can be really touchy subjects, and I think
09:09
it’s important that we do what we can to educate students about what
09:15
we’re doing, but at the same time it’s very difficult to have students
09:18
engage if it’s not a conversation they’re either used to talking
09:22
about or they are just uncomfortable with those types of discussions.
09:28
One very big problem that we’ve always wanted to is having students coming
09:32
to events, so we’ve had very little turnout for events unless there’s
09:36
food offered or if it’s a fun event.
09:40
Many of our like past, fun events like Henna Night or Dead Week Feast where
09:45
there’s food, we have a lot of students, but when it comes to more meaningful
09:51
events such as we just had an event for Native Sands, Native Lands where we
09:56
kind of connected the histories between native Hawaiians and Native Americans,
10:01
the turnout of students was a lot lower.
10:04
So I think those are the type of events that are a lot more important
10:06
to getting out, social justice, social advocacy, but yet those are the
10:11
events that are not as well attended.
10:13
So I think that’s a very big problem.
10:17
Last year our external had this really great idea to outreach to professors,
10:23
so I’ve been trying to kind of push for that this year, where we let professors
10:29
know of our events, and these are mostly professors in Ethnic Studies.
10:34
So we created a listserv of professors that were interested
10:36
and they were willing, and a lot of these professors offered these
10:40
events that we hold as extra credit.
10:42
So we’ve seen a much higher turnout of community members and students when
10:49
we have these connections to academic departments because it actually provides
10:53
an incentive for students to come out.
10:55
So that’s helped a lot.
10:57
Have you also connected with other departments, like Women and Gender
11:01
Studies or any other departments?
11:03
Or are you looking forward to doing that in the future?
11:06
Yeah, we’ve actually have a very diverse array of professor on our listserv, so
11:13
we do have Ethnic Studies, we do have some from Women and Gender…and I’m
11:25
pretty sure we’ve had professors that teach about transgender type of classes.
11:33
A lot of the professors that are advocating for these different types
11:38
of underrepresented people of color, and a lot of their courses kind
11:43
of structure around these types of discussions, are the professors we
11:47
kind of look towards and that’s what their courses are, they are offering
11:51
and teaching, so it’s very relevant.
11:55
Have you worked on events where you’ve attempted to incorporate the fun and
12:02
a more serious discussion, or do you typically do those separately, have
12:06
you tried that or does that work?
12:09
Yeah, this year our activities coordinators are very, very creative.
12:14
They’ve thought of the most creative ways to engage their participants, as
12:18
well as provide educational background.
12:22
The actual first one that came to mind is the Native Sands, Native Lands.
12:26
She came up with this great activity where they had food as kind of
12:34
their resources and to kind of illustrate why there were disparities.
12:42
I remember her explaining to me, they had Goldfish, some people would get more
12:46
than others and to explain that this is kind of how resources are allocated and
12:51
why that’s not fair and so that actually gives into perspective students that have
12:55
either less Goldfish or less Goldfish, like the privilege and oppression
12:59
that kind of came with colonization.
13:02
They kind of a made a story line out of it using different kinds of
13:04
candy and all these different, you know, resources, and I thought it was
13:09
so clever to be engaging, yet fun.
13:13
We had snacks that you could eat afterwards, and
13:15
so it was very, very clever.
13:19
I think another event that they held this year was talking about Asian authors
13:27
because it’s not a very big population.
13:30
The activity for that, they actually made bookmarks, and so they’re just
13:35
very clever with all their events.
13:36
So they try to make it very engaging, as well as interactive and very educational.
13:43
Those sound great.
13:45
This next question, I think you’ve mentioned a few of these,
13:47
but what do you consider your successes working at the APCC?
13:52
I think one of the biggest successes is, as a staff, watching the staff kind of
13:58
develop and grow, not only to leaders, but to become a lot more culturally competent
14:04
and aware of the types of injustices that are happening and what we can do to
14:11
further advocate or further change that.
14:14
I think it’s really hard to measure success, but I think, for me personally,
14:22
it’s more on a personal level how they’ve grown, and I guess being
14:26
in a position that I am, it’s more watching my staff, rather than success
14:31
I feel that I’ve done or I feel like I have in regards to my position.
14:38
A big goal for me at the beginning of the year was to kind of help my staff to
14:44
figure out their place in the world, and how they want to move forward knowing
14:50
the injustices, and if they’re of underrepresented groups of people, how
14:56
you can approach those kind of situations.
14:58
I think from the year they’ve come a really long way, and I
15:02
think that’s a really big success.
15:04
In terms of events, I think success is defined in the people that you
15:13
reach out to, not necessarily how much, but how much they take away.
15:18
We’ve definitely had students come up to us and tell us, “Thank you for having
15:22
these events, you know I’ve learned a lot, I didn’t know that” and I think that’s
15:28
an aspect of success I would define, just to know someone’s life has
15:35
been changed a little and they have a little more knowledge to take
15:38
with them and share with others.
15:41
Great.
15:43
In terms of the new center, you’ve been working in this center for a while and the
15:49
APCC just had its groundbreaking recently.
15:52
So can you talk a little bit about your role in the design process,
15:57
if you were a part of that, your role in the groundbreaking?
16:01
For the groundbreaking we were definitely involved in the whole mechanics behind it.
16:06
So, planning process, I was really, really sad that I couldn’t speak, I was actually
16:12
supposed to MC with Maiyee; I had class.
16:17
We did the planning for the invitations of who we were going to invite, the
16:23
whole like determining what type of activities we were going to have, what
16:29
kind of food we were going to have—the
16:33
whole layout of the timeline of just what we were going to do
16:38
for the groundbreaking event.
16:42
That
16:46
was a big part of what we were doing for groundbreaking.
16:49
What does the new center mean to you?
16:52
I think it’s a new beginning.
16:56
I’m really excited because we are moving, we are the only culture
17:01
center that is moving, and we’re moving to smack, dab middle of campus.
17:07
It will be great.
17:08
Many students have asked and we’re so excited because we’re
17:11
so much closer to campus.
17:16
I think that just shows our movement towards social justice, social
17:23
equality on this campus, social advocacy, and how important all
17:28
those aspects are to student life.
17:33
I think the new center is a representation of our fight for
17:39
that change and I think overall it’s just a very nice, new beginning.
17:48
The new center, as you mentioned, moves you closer to campus it will
17:51
move you right across from the NAL.
17:55
Can you talk a little bit about your interactions with staff from the other
18:02
cultural centers, and if this move will help be more a part of that?
18:07
You mentioned that you like doing collaborations with the other
18:10
centers, at least once a term; can you talk a little bit about that?
18:15
So I think being close to the NAL is definitely going to be a plus.
18:20
It will benefit the staff knowing that we are closer to other staff.
18:24
I think that’s one, that kind of goes back to the challenges, there’s
18:30
been a disconnect with the cultural center staff because we’re so far
18:33
apart from each other that if we ever go through a cycle where we’re
18:37
rehiring new staff, our staff wouldn’t necessarily know new staff on the BCC.
18:44
Although we go through training in the beginning of the year, if there’s new
18:47
staff hired, we don’t necessarily get to meet them, interact with them, and
18:52
just build relationships with them.
18:54
I think that was a plus of the community outreach position, but I think it’s really
19:00
unfortunate, because a lot of our staff don’t really know the other external
19:05
and internals of the other centers.
19:07
I think that’s definitely important because if we are fighting for this for
19:13
all underrepresented people of color we need to stay connected, you know,
19:17
together as one, but if that’s difficult to do on just this campus, then how can
19:22
we kind of show and demonstrate to the campus as a whole that we’re together
19:28
as one and we’re fighting together.
19:33
But I think that was one thing that we tried to do, that we tried to do
19:37
this year, is that we tried to have interactions where our centers got to
19:42
interact with each other, just our staff.
19:44
It was really difficult, it’s really busy here, but we do have our new
19:50
liaisons next year and I will - we have been trying to teach them.
19:56
Unfortunately, they haven’t been able to take a class.
19:59
Me and Maiyee have been emphasizing the importance of interacting
20:02
with other cultural centers and keeping those connections together.
20:08
I’m curious with your position as external coordinator if you make
20:13
connection with another department on behalf of the APCC, do you share that
20:18
connection with other cultural centers?
20:20
Is that part of what you do if you have a great event with one particular
20:25
professor, do you let them know about the other centers, how does that
20:28
process work in terms of communication?
20:32
Not essentially.
20:34
What we do as internal/externals, we meet once a month with all the other
20:42
CRCs, Culture Resource Coordinators, but even then our meetings are only
20:46
an hour, not everyone is always there, there’s so much to catch up
20:51
on, but we only have that one hour.
20:54
Even then all our lives are so scattered in different directions that it’s really
20:58
hard to find the common ground to be…We want to meet with the Pride Center and
21:04
just have a meet and greet with our staff, and so…I think when we find these
21:11
different connections, they can come up during these meetings, but essentially, if
21:16
I should find an Asian American professor that I felt was beneficial to us, may
21:21
not be relevant so to say to the Native American Longhouse, so a lot of these
21:27
connections are usually kept within the center, which I feel could be a benefit
21:31
but could also be a downfall that we could work on those types of communications.
21:37
Especially if those professors are very supportive, they could be supportive
21:40
to other cultural centers as well.
21:45
In terms of your ideas for the future, sort of the bigger picture,
21:50
what projects, events, activities would you have liked to have seen, or
21:55
would you recommend for the future?
21:57
I think activities and programs I would like to see weekly events, just to provide
22:06
continuity to students, you know, students on campus to know that we’re here.
22:11
I feel like if there’s a continuity in the programs that we have, let’s say
22:16
maybe having like a weekly discussion of anything at all, then that could be
22:22
associated with the center, and that could definitely increase your retention
22:26
in the amount of students that come by to the center just knowing that there’s
22:30
a space, even if the weekly activity is a study space, it provides, I feel,
22:37
this continuity where students know that the center is providing this activity
22:43
once a week and you know where to go.
22:47
I think that’s something to look for in the future, especially with the
22:51
new centers, we have such large and beautiful spaces that it would definitely
22:58
be something that could even more so attract students to the centers.
23:04
What advice would you give future APCC staff, or other OSU cultural center staff?
23:10
And it sounds like as your role, that’s part of what you do, is prepare
23:16
the future leaders of the centers?
23:18
Yeah, I think my biggest advice would be to stay connected, stay
23:24
positive, and definitely remember what we’re working towards.
23:33
Having events that have low turnouts can be discouraging sometimes, I think it’s
23:38
easy to lose sight of what the bigger picture of what we’re fighting for because
23:44
of the smaller tasks that need to be done.
23:48
We need timelines, we need, you know, things to meet deadlines.
23:52
Caught up in all that, sometimes we forget we’re celebrating who we are
23:57
and our identities and how far we’ve come and how much more we have yet to
24:01
go and what we need to do to get there.
24:06
I can say that in terms of our heritage month, you know, we’re always like,
24:11
“Are you on your program plans?
24:12
Are you getting it done?” But the bigger picture is these events are
24:16
to show our advocacy for our history and what we’re trying to do to change
24:25
the inequalities and oppression that we face.
24:28
I think just keeping an open mind, and definitely staying true to your
24:33
values and enjoying what you do, I think that’s a very big thing, staying
24:37
passionate and always think positive.
24:43
Based on working at the APCC, what is the takeaway that you’ve gained that
24:48
you would like to share with others?
24:51
I think the biggest takeaway I’ve had working here is my level of
24:58
cultural competency and awareness.
25:02
I think that’s definitely something to be shared.
25:05
I think the only way we can break these oppressions and inequalities is
25:10
to face it and to kind of address the systems that are holding it into place.
25:17
I think the only way we can break those systems is to be educated and to advocate
25:23
and to just give others that information to know what we can do with what we have.
25:32
We actually just attended a conference this past Saturday in regards to
25:36
Asian Americans and Health Care, and just from that I feel that
25:44
we can see how this race discussion kind of overlaps into every aspect of
25:51
our life - not only health care, but education, the type of housing we live
25:56
in, the type of environments we live in, and I think that cultural competency is
26:04
key to what we need to move forward and to changing these different systems.
26:11
What is the biggest issue for you in terms of the purpose of the APCC?
26:16
Why is it important that it exists and continues to flourish?
26:22
I think that it’s essential that the APCC, as well as the other cultural resource
26:27
centers on campus, to provide students a source of comfort to know that they’re
26:34
supported, a safe space to know that they can come here and not feel they’re judged.
26:46
I was telling my staff earlier, every year we always have one student that
26:50
continually comes daily, and to know that we’re here to kind of support that, it
26:58
makes a difference if it’s one person because, I guess, in terms of other
27:04
ways of looking at it, if the center wasn’t available, where would they go?
27:09
Would they be in the position that they are?
27:11
Would they still feel supported?
27:13
I think that’s what’s important for these cultural resource centers is
27:17
that it provides students networks with other students that, you
27:22
know, may look like themselves, or may identify very similarly.
27:28
It’s not to say we’re exclusive, but to know that we have a center specifically
27:33
dedicated to Asian Pacific Islanders, we provide that comfort to know that
27:37
they can come here and know what we have resources to direct them to people that
27:43
identify with Asian and Pacific Islander.
27:46
So in a way you already answered this question, but how would you
27:50
describe the impact of the APCC on students, on API students?
28:00
I think it’s a big impact.
28:01
It’s a gathering ground.
28:05
Asian and Pacific Islanders are very keen on community, so I think
28:10
it provides that community space.
28:12
I
28:18
think what’s difficult with students, though, that identify as Asian, is
28:22
that a lot of these students are very wary of coming for help sometimes.
28:32
I think that’s what we’re here to provide is help and support, even if they come
28:37
to talk or just to chill or spend time with us, that’s great if it helps them,
28:43
but the students that don’t feel they can come because they’re either shy
28:48
or they’re hesitant, I think those are the students we need to outreach to.
28:56
The students that do come in and utilize the center, I think it has
29:00
a huge impact because it provides a space that they feel like they can
29:03
come, and it is a home away from home.
29:07
Do you have any suggestions of how you can potentially do that type of
29:11
outreach to the students that may need to come, that should come in
29:16
perhaps to get the extra help, but for whatever reason may not want to, do
29:20
you have ideas or strategies for that?
29:22
Yeah, I think, well we work closely with
29:29
CRFs and the UHGF’s, so Community Relation Facilitators, and with this new First
29:35
Year Experience where students are, its mandatory to be in the dorms and
29:41
residence halls, to utilize that and to utilize our relationships with the
29:45
CRFs to kind of outreach to first year students to let them know we are here.
29:51
A lot of students don’t know we are actually here until like their
29:54
third or fourth year, and it’s so sad because students have come and
29:58
been like, “Where has this been?
30:00
I didn’t know, this is my fourth year,” so you know kind of utilizing
30:04
those relationships and using it as a bridge to have students come
30:09
over and utilize the center and to see what resources we can provide.
30:15
Hopefully that strategy in addition to moving toward the center of
30:19
campus, hopefully that combined will make you much more visible.
30:25
Definitely, we’ll be right next to West.
30:27
So what suggestions do you have in terms of, let me go back to the other question.
30:37
How would you describe the impact of the APCC on the OSU and local community?
30:43
So on the community as a whole, I think, I think we have a very large impact that
30:52
Asian Pacific Islanders rely heavily on family and community and this is to say
30:58
that we are connected with a lot of Asian Pacific Islander student groups on campus.
31:04
And when they have their cultural shows we always see family, elders,
31:08
and community members and I think that goes to show that our outreach
31:13
to the community and our impact on it.
31:16
Even with other events that we have held we had an event recently on the
31:24
Palestine history and we actually had community member that came.
31:31
Luckily our staff that was hosting the event could speak Arabic so he
31:36
could actually speak to them, but that shows that a lot of the community
31:41
that associate with these identities feel that they can come which is great
31:46
and they feel that they can associate and be engaged in these kind of
31:49
conversations which I think is wonderful.
31:52
That is great.
31:55
What suggestions do you have or ideas for future collaboration with the OSU
32:00
and local community, so extending that.
32:03
Yeah, I think one big one would be community service.
32:09
I definitely want to see more community service from collaborations with the
32:16
staff to either the OSU campus or other networks out in the Corvallis
32:21
community, even as a bigger whole.
32:24
I know one year we did a Locks of Love type of event and I think
32:33
that’s what type of events I would like to see with the center.
32:40
So hopefully it can show that we are outreaching to community and
32:45
doing what we can to change and to further advocate for others that
32:50
may not feel like they have a voice.
32:52
And
32:54
can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories is
32:59
important to your identity, if it is?
33:02
I think sharing stories is essential to kind of holding on to what is going on
33:12
now, and being able to look back and see either the changes or just stories that
33:22
have to do with identity if identity, the definition of identity changes in years.
33:29
I think that telling stories also preserves cultural history, cultural
33:35
stories, cultural memories, either through family or personal experience I think
33:44
these stories are kind of a snapshot into the present day or later on into the past.
33:52
Great, so as one of our final questions, can you describe your
33:57
experiences here at OSU pertaining to your racial or ethnic identities?
34:03
How you have been shaped?
34:05
If your perception has changed, if it stayed the same, just your
34:09
overall experience here at OSU.
34:12
Yeah, I think it definitely has changed.
34:16
I’m a lot more liberal now.
34:22
I am taking an Anthro.
34:23
class on race in addition to my training here at the center, the way
34:29
to look at race is very different.
34:32
The way I evaluate my internal biases are very different, the way
34:38
I approach situations and kind of question situations are very different.
34:43
And I think, I think it’s in a good way, and I think it helps to be
34:49
a lot more critical when looking at other situations in general.
34:54
I think looking back from where we have come from, we have come a long way, but in
35:02
regards to the recent issues we’ve had on campus regarding the hate messages things
35:11
that came up in the Barometer with the ASOSU elections, we have a long way to go.
35:18
Seeing what has been done to kind of change those thoughts, seeing the
35:25
advocacy on campus, very proactive like the march I think it gives me a
35:31
lot of hope as to what we are reaching for and what we are trying to change.
35:36
Although, I know there is a long way to go but, I guess the way I
35:42
identify myself and the way I look at my own race is definitely changed
35:47
and the way I question situations and discussions has definitely changed.
35:53
And I would like to think that I am a lot more educated but, I know there is
36:00
a lot more to learn and I am eager to move forward and learn those things.
36:05
Great as a quick follow up, did you participate in the Solidarity march?
36:11
Either just as an individual or as a representative of the APCC, can
36:17
you talk a little bit about that?
36:18
I actually had class that whole day.
36:21
I did hear that when I was in class that I was very proud to
36:26
know what they were fighting for and I was a part of that picture
36:31
just being at the cultural centers.
36:34
But I personally wasn’t able to partake in that event but I was there in spirit.
36:40
And I think that march gives so much hope because there wasn’t just students in
36:48
that March, there was faculty there was staff and there was a lot of things that
36:53
was written down that gave me hope that we aren’t going to tolerate this type of
36:58
behavior and that it’s going to take a lot to get to where we want to go, but no one
37:05
has given up and we are still fighting.
37:08
It has definitely given me hope to see that March and to see it unfold.
37:14
And is there anything we have not discussed that you would
37:18
like to add or follow up on?
37:22
I think I’m ok, but thank you for holding this interview and doing this.
37:28
Great, thank you so much
37:30
Thank you.
