00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández, and I am Oregon State University’s
00:06
Oregon Multicultural librarian.
00:08
Today’s date is January 30th, 2015, and we are conducting an oral history
00:14
interview as part of the IRCO Asian Family Center oral history project.
00:19
So let’s get started.
00:21
If you could please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:25
Thank you, Natalia.
00:27
My name is Ronault Latang Sayang Catalani.
00:30
Last name is spelled C-A-T-A-L-A-N-I.
00:35
And my personal name is spelled R-O-N-A-U-L-T.
00:41
And then I have two middle initials, L and S.
00:46
And those middle initials…
00:47
They stand for Latang Sayang.
00:50
Okay, does that have any particular being translated to English?
00:53
Yes.
00:58
Not a good way to translate it directly, but it, it is—it would
01:02
be like heart song, heartbeat.
01:05
And it really means compassion and caring.
01:11
And what is your birthdate and your birthplace?
01:13
15 December
01:19
1953.
01:19
Our family was living in the Dutch East Indies at that time, but we
01:24
were on holiday in the Netherlands, so my birthplace--by accident, by
01:30
lucky accident--was Den Haag, the parliamentary capital of the Netherlands.
01:37
And with which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
01:42
Oh, lots.
01:43
You know, in our country, we have 700 living languages, right,
01:47
down from 1200 two decades ago.
01:51
But Indonesia is a kind of intersection of many, many cultures, so race
01:57
and ethnicity are complicated.
01:59
We are all mestizos, you know.
02:01
In our case we’re called Indos, so we are mixed blood.
02:05
But primarily, on my abuelo, on my father’s father’s side, on my grandpa’s
02:10
side, we are Catalán--Barcelona, Catalán.
02:15
And on my mother’s side, we are what was called [?] , you know,
02:19
or Earth People from Sulawesi.
02:23
So, they ethnic group there is Manado, from the island of Sulawesi, the
02:28
nationality would now be Indonesia, but there wasn’t a nation called
02:33
Indonesia at the time I was born.
02:37
Great.
02:38
And, when and where were your parents born?
02:42
My father, our father, 1927 in la casa in the island of Sulawesi--was
02:48
then called Celebes, also in what is now the nation of Indonesia.
02:53
And my mother in Manado,
03:00
same island, Sulawesi--the time she was born it was called Celebes; 1931
03:07
for our mother.
03:10
And where did you grow up?
03:13
Eh, that’s complicated.
03:14
In
03:16
Indonesia, of course.
03:20
We went through, and when I was young at the time of real political
03:28
instability, like every nation like you see in Arab countries now.
03:34
So, it was a time of severe civil strife, murderous civil strife.
03:39
And so, first in Indonesia we left,
03:45
we were expelled, and lived in the Netherlands for six more
03:49
years, where I started school.
03:52
And then we moved to the United States in 1966.
03:57
And then
04:01
1972, six years later, I won the lottery to be drafted into the American army.
04:09
It is the first time our family’s every won anything, we are
04:13
old-school, long-time losers.
04:16
My parents, our father, thought that it would be a very bad idea to go
04:20
back to the chaos we had just left in southeast Asia, so I went to live with
04:27
my grandpa, my mother’s mother--my mother’s father in the Netherlands
04:32
again until Mr. Nixon became president.
04:35
He called off the draft, called off this—he defunded the selective service
04:40
administration and they just forgot about me, which made it safe for me
04:45
to come back to the United States.
04:47
And, I went to university then.
04:50
And when your family moved here in 1966, where did you move?
04:55
Here to Oregon?
04:56
To Salem, Oregon, yes.
04:57
How did you and your family choose Salem?
05:00
Good question.
05:03
Yeah, Salem is not a pretty place to be, you know, in the
05:09
1960s.
05:09
Here’s how it worked in those days under different immigration law regime: In those
05:16
days, the policy of the United States was to move people all over the place, that
05:22
is, not to create pockets of ethnicities
05:27
or ethno-cultural groups or races.
05:28
So,
05:33
immigrants, refugees--we were refugees--were sponsored by churches.
05:38
So, through the Catholic, Catholic system, or through the Lutheran system
05:44
or Presbyterian institutions, sponsor churches were found for families.
05:51
And so, there was a Presbyterian church in Salem, Oregon--very, very
05:56
kind uncles and aunties who took care of us and settled us there, got us
06:03
an apartment, got my father a lovely 1953 Chevy Bellaire, two-tone, and
06:13
got him a job at a woolen mill.
06:15
So we were very grateful to these folks.
06:18
They loved my parents and mother like a grandma would, you know, a daughter, and
06:24
taught us everything we needed to know.
06:27
So the support system was the church community?
06:30
The church, yes.
06:30
You didn’t seek out other organizations?
06:33
It sounded like you didn’t need other organizations, the church
06:35
community took care of your needs?
06:38
Well, we did need more, of course.
06:40
And I don’t want to minimize in any way or show any lack of respect for
06:44
these folks because we thought of them as our grandparents, and I love
06:49
them still to this day and cried like a baby when they passed away.
06:54
But, you know, folks in Salem don’t know a lot about the world
07:02
outside of Salem, and we are from quite a cosmopolitan background.
07:08
In Indonesia, you have to be fluent in several languages to get by—you have
07:13
to be able to work with Muslims, and Buddhists, and Hindus, and Christians, and
07:17
Communists, and for us, it’s just normal.
07:20
So we’re used to a higher level, you know, I guess, of language and
07:26
ethno-cultural complexity than Salem.
07:29
So, for many reasons it was not quite enough for us to be in that community.
07:34
And, we sought out other refugees from our parts of the world.
07:41
And, our father then sponsored my mother’s sisters to come join us.
07:48
So then we had, my mom had her sisters, and as you know, this is really important
07:53
to traditional people for women to have their sisters and their moms around.
07:57
And so, it created a safe and more secure community for our
08:01
mom to raise her children.
08:02
We had our cousins, thirteen in all.
08:05
So, we had our own tribe soon enough.
08:10
Also, we made friends real rapidly with Mexican kids up
08:15
the street and down the street.
08:16
And, I don’t want to make it sound like there was a lot of us, there wasn’t.
08:21
There was always six, eight, ten brown boys and girls in the school,
08:26
and it was our family or the Mexican families we became familia with.
08:34
And how old were you when you moved to Salem?
08:37
Twelve.
08:38
You were twelve, and so you went middle school and high school in Salem?
08:40
Yeah.
08:40
It was called junior high in those days and then senior high.
08:48
So then, you were drafted and you moved and then when you came back,
08:52
your family was still in Salem, Oregon, so you moved back to Salem?
08:56
Yes, yes.
08:57
And then you mentioned you went to college.
08:59
Yes.
09:00
So how did you choose your college?
09:01
You wanted to stay in Oregon?
09:03
Oh, I didn’t choose.
09:04
You know, my older brother’s the first ever, in history,
09:11
to graduate from high school.
09:13
You know, in the Dutch Colony apartheid system of South
09:16
Africa or Indonesia--Indonesia was a Dutch colony too.
09:20
In the apartheid regime, you get to go to different levels of
09:26
education depending on your race.
09:30
So, if you are [?] , if you are native, third grade, fifth grade, roughly,
09:36
in equivalence to American education.
09:38
If you are mixed blood like we are, maybe you would get to go to eighth grade or,
09:43
yeah, eighth grade, end of middle school unless you were really an excellent
09:47
student, then you could go farther.
09:49
So, my older brother was the first and I was the second ever to
09:53
finish regular, public high school.
09:56
You know, public high school means you all start off at the same place
10:00
with a diploma, and you get set free in the mainstream and you compete for
10:04
work--we were the first to do this.
10:06
And so, I was the first to go to university ever, anywhere.
10:11
And so, I knew nothing about universities, and I wouldn’t have
10:14
known and wouldn’t have known how to begin even, but I was an athlete in
10:20
middle school or junior high and high school, international competition.
10:24
And so, I was picked up on an athletic scholarship by University of Oregon.
10:27
Actually, also offered one by OSU, but the U of O one had some money attached as well
10:34
as books and tuition, so I went there.
10:40
And it was wonderful, but, you know, I did not graduate from
10:43
high school, I didn’t finish.
10:45
I didn’t have enough math credits, I didn’t have enough health credits,
10:49
and interestingly I didn’t have enough physical education credits, although,
10:54
my life was around being a jock.
10:58
We didn’t get P.E. credits for being in sports junior high, or
11:02
junior or senior or varsity sports.
11:05
So had it not been for athletics, I would not have gone further.
11:10
In fact, our high school counsellor--and this really underscores a lot of the
11:15
reason why I’m involved at IRCO or Asian Family Center or Africa House.
11:21
Without a kind of a broader context for us to relate to in the mainstream or for
11:27
the mainstream to relate to us, my high school counsellor thought I was Mexican.
11:33
And, I was too polite to correct her, and she’s a nice woman, and
11:36
it’s an elderly woman, and, you know, we have great respect for aunties,
11:39
and so I would never contradict her, I would just smile and nod.
11:43
But, whenever I met her, which is once a year, she would greet me in Spanish
11:48
and start talking about her vacations in Acapulco, which is very popular at
11:52
the time, resort destination in Mexico.
11:55
And, you know, I would smile and nod.
11:59
But she sent me to what was then called Salem Tech to prepare for the next
12:04
school year to learn how to repair cars.
12:08
And you know, I’m not angry about this or anything, she recognized in me that
12:12
I’m able to concentrate, I’m disciplined, polite, so maybe a life under a hood of
12:18
a Chevy or a Ford would be good for me.
12:22
And, you know, and maybe she’s right when I look back on it, I mean, I probably
12:26
should have done that, it would have been an easier, simpler life to come
12:31
home from work after being at the garage.
12:35
But I didn’t go to Salem Tech, you know.
12:38
I hid out in the Netherlands until the draft was dismantled
12:42
and then came back to university.
12:46
And were your parents very supportive, they wanted you
12:49
to continue your education?
12:50
Was that something that they hoped for you?
12:52
Oh yes, our father’s a learned man and so is my mother’s oldest brother.
12:58
That’s what we call them traditionally, they’re not school
13:01
trained, but they are intellectuals.
13:03
And they are both what, in our communities are called Hakim, which means justice.
13:08
That is, if you have a family fight or a business fight, a neighborhood brawl,
13:13
you get Hakim from both sides of the dispute to seek out the elders from
13:18
both sides of the dispute to figure out what’s fair so we can live together.
13:25
It’s not an adversarial problem solving thing where you sue each
13:27
other like in America, but it’s a conciliatory problem solving platform
13:34
in most traditional cultures.
13:36
So, our father always read, and the first, one of the first things
13:40
he did was bought encyclopedias from a guy knocking on the door.
13:44
And, we had a 36 set of Encyclopedia Americana and a 36
13:48
volume set of Our Wonderful World.
13:51
And I made it a goal of mine to read each, all of our wonderful
13:55
world’s 18 volumes--they weighed about six pounds each--and I did.
14:00
So I know a lot about a lot of things, useless factoids.
14:05
But, we come from a family of smart people.
14:09
But we just don’t know anything about mainstream institutions,
14:13
education being one of them.
14:15
So what was your experience like at the University of Oregon,
14:19
and what did you want to study?
14:21
I didn’t know.
14:23
Different from our children now or our grandchildren where we’re asking
14:28
them all the time, “what do you like?” Ah, if you like this, then you
14:31
have a math brain, let’s go do that.
14:33
Or if you like this, you have a writing brain, let’s go read
14:37
books, let’s go draw pictures.
14:40
So, our parents, of course, traditional parents, probably same as yours,
14:43
never asked kids, “what do you want to do, you know, what do you like?”
14:48
That just wasn’t in the parenting.
14:50
So I went to university, I didn’t even know why I’m there.
14:52
I do know I have practice in the morning and in the evening, we have
14:55
training table at five, we have trips to all over the country, and you know,
15:00
I was an international competitor.
15:02
Also, that’s I was thinking about, but I had no idea what you do at university.
15:07
Luckily, there were some uncles, some professors, right--we call them
15:12
uncles--who then take care of you and say, “hey, come here, you look like
15:16
you’re smart, you look like you’re lost.” And, I have a great debt, humble debt of
15:24
gratitude to two professors who saw in me something and I became their protégé.
15:33
And I stress this because that’s our work, really, at Immigrant Refugee Communities
15:40
of Oregon, at IRCO--both Africa House and Asian Family Center--it’s to be
15:43
those uncles that look at kids at say and connect them--you know, “I recognize your
15:48
intelligence or I recognize your kindness or I recognize your creativity, let me
15:53
hook you up.” Otherwise, we’re never going to find our way into the mainstream.
15:59
Like, my parents wouldn’t know how.
16:02
When we grow up, when the phone rang, we dashed to it—my older brother and me.
16:07
Not only because it might be school and we’re in trouble, but because we
16:12
are the mediators between our parents who work really hard, really long and
16:18
with really bad people, our parents who come home exhausted and anxious.
16:24
So we mediate that world for them in every way we can by answering phones, by not
16:30
embarrassing the person on the other end of the phone with their difficult accents.
16:35
You know, when you pull up to the gasoline station one of us kids will
16:38
order it, you know, to show respect to our dad, you know, but also because we
16:43
don’t want the gas station guy to make fun of our father’s speaking because to
16:49
us, he’s this heroic gentlemen, right, that generation of men, like your father
16:56
or your grandpa, got your family out of some really deep shit, you know.
17:02
And, kept everybody together and kept everyone moving and worked 20 hours
17:06
a day to make money so moms could be relaxed and be able to properly
17:13
love and nurture their children.
17:15
You know, so we love them a lot.
17:20
So then, at the U of O, these professors, what were they, um, professors of?
17:28
Yeah, one is Professor Goswami, he’s Indian, of course,
17:32
Gujarati, and he is a physicist.
17:36
And this—I’m a guy who didn’t have enough math credits to finish high
17:39
school, but this man made sense to me.
17:42
And he is recently in a Hollywood feature, feature movie called
17:47
What the Blank Blank Blank.
17:49
And,
17:51
physicists are a lot like shamans, you know, they’re a lot like priests.
17:56
It’s a very close place--quantum mechanics and mystical religions
18:01
are actually the same thing.
18:03
So, he captured my attention.
18:04
I would still pay money to go listen to his lectures today, he was just brilliant.
18:10
That’s on the science-y side.
18:11
On the other side, I met a professor named James Chowning Davies who’s
18:17
an international scholar on human migrations and political revolution.
18:22
And Professor Davies, who then became my next younger brother’s mentor,
18:27
six years younger than me, right, because otherwise how would know
18:31
if we don’t have family members to show you how to sort things out.
18:36
He was my mentor.
18:37
He—a beautiful gentlemen, but he only knew walking from his house in Skinners butte,
18:47
Spencers Butte, in Eugene to his office and from his office to the lecture hall.
18:52
He was encyclopedic brain, a very kind uncle, but he didn’t really leave Eugene.
18:59
So, I did his field work for him in the Netherlands and Greece and
19:04
Turkey when I was undergraduate—and, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia.
19:11
When I was a graduate student in Iran, India, and Thailand.
19:17
Good for him, good for me.
19:19
So…
19:19
These were fellowships and grants?
19:21
Yeah.
19:22
Yeah.
19:22
So I did most of my work outside of the country, and I’m good at this, right.
19:26
I know how to maneuver.
19:29
I’m ethnically ambiguous, you know.
19:31
Where we grew up, you learn languages really quickly because that’s how
19:33
you show respect and stay alive.
19:36
And so, I did his work, and he took care of me, and it worked out just very well.
19:43
So what did you, what did you major in?
19:46
Well I had to major in more than one because I just love this.
19:49
There’s this universe of things to learn, and I didn’t start learning until later.
19:57
And, this again gets into my work at present, both as a community
20:00
lawyer and as a board member and counsel for IRCO and alike.
20:05
And I work for the city.
20:06
Is that, our children are developmentally delayed.
20:09
You can’t go through traumatic dislocation, traumatic discontinuities,
20:15
and just pick up where you left off.
20:17
Our children are behind, and it takes three, four, eight year to catch up and
20:24
get over all of that, especially refugees who leave under murderous circumstances.
20:34
So, it wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I started to be able to think clearly,
20:41
articulate well, and study and be—I never spoke up in class ever in Salem.
20:50
I mean, I think I was invisible, I think, you know, if you look at the
20:53
yearbook, I probably wouldn’t be there.
20:55
You know, I had no place.
20:57
Now, of course as an athlete, I was.
20:59
But that’s physical and you’d say nothing, and it’s very clear as an athlete what you
21:03
need to do, especially in a combat sport.
21:06
There’s you and your adversary, that’s it, and whoever is the last to
21:11
quit, the last to become exhausted, wins, period--that’s how that works.
21:17
We are raised on combat sports where we grow up, so shifting from Jujutsu or
21:22
boxing to Greco-Roman or international freestyle wrestling was easy for me.
21:29
But, in university, I started to, you know, kind of wake up and blossom.
21:35
That went well.
21:36
So, suddenly everything—to answer your question about
21:38
majors—was so interesting to me.
21:40
So I did a major in political science.
21:43
Psychology was so interesting to me and I was going to become a
21:46
therapist, so I have a major there.
21:49
But, philosophy is so interesting to me because it’s words, it’s concepts,
21:54
it’s underlying reasons for reasons.
21:57
So, I finished those three majors, as well as a kajillion air miles.
22:06
And then, right after your bachelor’s degree, did you do your graduate work…
22:11
Yes.
22:11
NF: …or was there time between?
22:11
No, I stuck with Dr. Davies.
22:13
Wonderful.
22:13
And so, what was your graduate work in?
22:15
Human Migrations.
22:17
Yeah.
22:18
And what year did you finish graduate school?
22:22
Um, well, I didn’t finish because I made pregnant the mother of our children.
22:30
It was
22:33
1979.
22:35
Yes.
22:36
Did you meet your wife in Eugene?
22:40
Yes, I met her in Eugene.
22:42
I was, in fact, I was working on my psychology degree.
22:46
So we had to do practicum, and I loved children, so I was a
22:49
teacher in University of Oregon Child Care and Development Center.
22:54
And, it was important because they have a lot of international students
22:57
there, and I was the only non-Anglo there, so I could explain to teachers.
23:02
They had a box where it would be a sand box, but they put rice in it.
23:08
And you know, everywhere rice is sacred beside it being food.
23:13
You know, rice is a staple, I mean, it’s as close to God as you can come, you know.
23:18
And, and they had rice for kids to play in.
23:22
And so, for international students, whether they’re Arabs or Persians
23:26
or Africans or Latinos or Asians, playing in rice was not right, right.
23:32
So, things like that as well other matters of how children are raised and disciplined
23:38
and expected was something I could I add to the curriculum, add to the score, the
23:46
competence of the teaching crew there.
23:51
Yeah, so, and yeah, so I did those things.
23:55
And then, when I was teacher then the, a mother, with—a single mother—with
24:01
a four year old boy was one of my students, and I fell in love with her.
24:06
And, I was working for Dr. Davies in India at the time, and she came over.
24:11
And so, we conceived our daughter,
24:15
[?] , in Delhi, when I was at Delhi University.
24:19
And she, interestingly, has women and children’s HIV
24:24
clinics and stuff in India too.
24:26
So we’ve made a complete loop from where she’s conceived,
24:29
you know, to her work in India.
24:33
We are a very lucky family.
24:35
Wonderful.
24:36
So then, you, as a family, you were in Eugene, how did you
24:40
decide where to go to next?
24:42
Was it very clear that you wanted to remain in Oregon?
24:46
Yes.
24:46
Or, did you move up to Portland?
24:48
What happened after that?
24:48
No, I have
24:51
a wife now, pregnant with a baby on the way, so finishing school was,
24:57
sort of, went to the back burner.
24:59
And, you know, every university town there really is no work.
25:03
And I couldn’t make sandwiches or, you know, that kind of
25:08
money is not enough for family.
25:09
And she was bringing a four year old, so we’d immediately be a family of four.
25:14
So, I found a friend of mine working in the children services division,
25:21
and this was then Oregon Department of Human Resources, and she’s the
25:28
affirmative action director there.
25:32
And I said, “Oh my god, Vicky, I need work.” And, again, it’s by connections
25:38
to people close to your ethnic or racial groups that we know each other
25:43
from school or from social situations.
25:46
She got me a job as a social worker in Coos Bay, Oregon, and I immediately became
25:52
the brown boy in the office, which meant all the Mexicanos and the Native Americans
25:56
and Fijians and Japanese families were sent to see me to solve their problems.
26:04
And, it was very interesting because my take on how to do this work
26:08
was very scary, too mainstream,
26:13
protocol…
26:15
Could you give an example of that?
26:17
Sure.
26:17
Yeah.
26:18
And it’s still my work today.
26:20
We believe that we folks, especially traditional people, really
26:24
already know how to do things, we know already how to do things.
26:28
And you do it just like your mom did it, like your grandma
26:30
did, and like her grandma did.
26:32
And, community has a part in solving problems.
26:36
So, what’s now called “strengths based counselling” or “strengths
26:40
based therapy or parenting,” is what I started doing there.
26:45
So, for example, there’re lots of Fiji Island people there.
26:50
When the Fiji mom lost her temper and clobbered her kid, I suggested we don’t
26:58
take the child into foster care away from the family, no, but we bring the
27:02
entire family in, and all those aunties and grandmas put pressure on that mom
27:08
because we know we’re not cruel to our children, that is not allowed.
27:13
She was feeling lonely, she, her husband was not good to her, it was his family
27:18
not her family, so she didn’t have a support system of ladies to support her
27:24
politically as well socially and help her with way too many kids, and she lost it.
27:29
So, we expect the family to fix this problem, I’m expecting you all, you know,
27:36
care for her so she can care for them.
27:38
You don’t want the state involved with your kids, you don’t want a judge
27:42
deciding what’s best, you don’t want your baby boy and girl in a white household
27:48
across town, and it’s gonna take you six months to get your two kids back,
27:53
at best, if you get a great lawyer.
27:56
That system is not healthy, it’s not happy, it harms everyone, so you all need
28:01
to be responsible for solving the problem.
28:03
What’s more, if you put that, those two children in grandma’s
28:07
house, it costs nothing.
28:09
If you put those children in foster care, it costs a lot.
28:12
And, in the end, the research is already there how badly children are harmed by
28:17
the instability, insecurity being cared for in foster care, it’s not right.
28:23
So, we were doing this with Native American families, with Japanese, with
28:27
Mexicanos because mostly--there are a few psychos out there who hurt kids and
28:32
they need to go to prison—but mostly, you’re having a social problem, you’re
28:36
having a familial problem, not a personal guilt problem, not a criminal problem.
28:42
So the systems that are set up to criminalize people from this behavior
28:46
were completely inappropriate, ineffective, and way too expensive.
28:51
So, when I was doing this, people from the district offices and from the
28:55
state offices would come and watch, in part, to do risk management with
28:59
me because they’re afraid, you know, about this, but also because the
29:04
better educated folks are recognizing the efficiency of what we’re doing.
29:08
So your coworkers, administration, they were supportive and they saw
29:13
the results, the good results?
29:14
Yeah, our branch manager was, right.
29:17
And that was very, very lucky for me because it isn’t always so.
29:21
These are risk-adverse agencies.
29:26
But, Pat [?] --Pat [?] , later, we lived in the same neighborhood
29:30
in Salem again when our kids were going to elementary school.
29:34
His daughter, my daughter later became best friends in high school, but he
29:38
supported my thinking in how to do this.
29:42
And since he had no skills in these communities—access, trust--but I did,
29:48
he simply had to take my word for it, I could have been making this stuff up.
29:52
But, I think, to the credit of institutions like this one, child care
29:57
institutions, they’re culturally curious, and they’re also getting that the
30:02
system’s not really working, the system’s expensive and it hurts people forever.
30:08
So he was willing to trust me, but he had to bring in his regional and state
30:15
administrators, you know, to cover him.
30:18
So, we became a little laboratory.
30:24
And this works out later in the history of work with communities
30:29
because that’s what we’ve been doing.
30:30
Now, it’s not fully developed into culturally specific services, right, this
30:36
is a service delivery model that allows, that allows the county—Multnomah County
30:42
or Marion County, state of Oregon—to give these huge grants, multiyear grants, to
30:47
Asian family Center or to Africa House or to Latino Network Programa Hispano
30:53
and alike, and to say to them, okay we trust you know how to do this, we
30:57
already know we can’t, we can’t even do it with white folks, it’s a mess.
31:02
You seem to be able to do this much cheaper, much more efficiently,
31:06
and with great compassion and for long-term outcomes, you just take
31:11
the money and go take care of it.
31:13
So, I was a part of that and the development of the, of the policies
31:19
and practice in Oregon history.
31:23
So then after Coos, it sounded like you moved, you and your
31:26
family moved to Salem for a time.
31:29
And then, this was in the early 80s, correct?
31:32
Yes, this job, I couldn’t continue being a case worker.
31:37
You know, the distance between what I wanted to do with families in crisis and
31:44
my power to do it was too great, right.
31:48
It’s a very difficult job being a case worker—many, many young people coming
31:53
out of universities wanting to be helpers are just destroyed by this, are just
31:57
crushed by this, are made bitter by this, and I could see that right away.
32:02
And, so I went to law school
32:06
in Salem again so that our parents and my brothers and their wives or
32:12
girlfriends could help care for our children ‘cuz then I had more kids.
32:18
So we used the traditional family style, you know.
32:21
Where our generation can work hard, it’s what we do, but our elder
32:24
generation is really good at parenting, so why don’t they stay home, love
32:28
these kids properly and when we would go to work and make money.
32:31
So I did, I had to go to law school.
32:33
I had three part time jobs, and, you know, just like my pop, you know.
32:40
If I could cut my work, I sleep down to four hours, that’s how
32:44
we model what men do, right.
32:46
Men are heavy lifters, it’s what we do.
32:50
And if we can get our wives’ respect for that, you know, and our children’s love
32:54
then we’re done, we go back and do it again tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
32:59
So that’s what we did, it took me three more years to get a doctorate in law.
33:04
And then another couple more years to get a postdoc in community lawyering, which is
33:09
basically the model I’ve just explained.
33:12
People know how to solve their own problems, they really do,
33:15
especially traditional people.
33:16
We’ve always been solving our own problems, we never had government’s
33:20
help, we never had Asian Family Center or Africa House, you know.
33:26
We took care of it within our family systems, and we’ve done a pretty good job.
33:30
So, community lawyering is the same concept where we
33:33
really know how to do this.
33:34
And, in a community, you have all the skills you need.
33:39
On a Sunday dinner table, you have someone who can work on your Toyota, someone who
33:43
can working on your teeth, someone who can talk to God for you, someone who can talk
33:48
to your enemy, someone who can grow crops, someone who can cook like a wizard, right.
33:53
And we all have these skills, and some people get paid more or paid less,
33:58
are educated more or less, but each of those skills are really essential to
34:03
a healthy, happy community or family.
34:06
That’s the model we have then undertaken for community development.
34:12
And your postdoc was in Salem, that community lawyering?
34:14
No, at Howard University in D.C., a historic African American institution with
34:22
some of the grandest statesmen and jurists in American were schooled at Howard.
34:27
It’s wonderful.
34:29
Yeah.
34:30
So then after your postdoc, you came back to Oregon and you and your family remained
34:36
in Salem for a bit or did you move?
34:38
Yeah.
34:40
During the postdoc time, I was given a stipend for practicum to start
34:44
developing community law practice.
34:47
And so, we did that in Salem, quickly organized Cambodians,
34:51
Vietnamese, Hmong, Yumen communities.
34:54
And then we took the model to Portland because, at the time,
34:57
Portland was overwhelmed, at least Portlanders felt they were overwhelmed.
35:03
Nowadays folks are overwhelmed by Spanish speakers, back then they were overwhelmed
35:07
by southeast Asians—it was only 25,000.
35:11
It’s only 25,000 southeast Asians showed up here from four sending countries.
35:16
And so, these are folks, then, in the same situation we were in.
35:22
Complete communities,
35:26
including everything from priests, politicians, poets, prostitutes, moved,
35:33
like your family from Cuba, over here.
35:35
So, everything’s there already, they’re just missing the real estate that
35:39
used to be underneath their feet.
35:42
We know that America is very erosive of all those skills and values
35:49
and talents and abilities—in fact, destructive of traditional cultures.
35:56
So the caring community systems we have set up with IRCO, among
36:00
others, is ways of, sort of, easing that transition, giving folks lots
36:08
of time and lots of support for settling--getting them confident again
36:12
as parents, reassuring them that you really know what to do, you really do.
36:19
Just take a deep breath, you know, we’re gonna go through this
36:21
together, you’re gonna go through it together with all these other folks.
36:24
Some will be Africans and some will be Arabs and some will Latinos and
36:28
so, but, you know, we’re all in this together, and we’re gonna have fun.
36:33
And so, that was my work then coming up here.
36:36
Things needed to be changed in Oregon statutes; we took care of that right away.
36:41
Things need to be changed in administrative rules; we took
36:44
care of those things right away.
36:45
And,
36:50
communities were given—I provide technical expertise as a lawyer.
36:56
I’m not a leader, you already know what to do, you tell me what your folks need,
37:00
and I’ll find a way to fashion it and find a process that will get us through this.
37:05
And that process is democracy, and you’re really gonna dig this, you know.
37:10
You can actually make safe forever the health and wealth of your children
37:18
by managing that school, that’s your school--you need to be down there,
37:22
telling teachers what you expect, that you’re there to help them, you know,
37:27
that you’re kids are disciplined.
37:28
You know, for us, it’s yes teacher, no teacher, we’re there to get educated.
37:33
That’s your police precinct--you need to help those police
37:36
officers, they don’t know.
37:37
They don’t know about Islam, they don’t know about Asians, they don’t
37:41
know about Latinos, we need to help them be better police officers.
37:45
You need to own it.
37:46
That’s democracy, we love this stuff.
37:49
We’re there to help them; they’re here to help us.
37:52
So that’s the model of self-sufficiency and integration that we represent at
37:59
IRCO, at Asian Family Center, Africa House, and that’s the model of immigrant
38:05
integration that I manage at city hall.
38:09
So when you moved to Portland, how did you connect with IRCO and Africa
38:15
House and Asian Family Center?
38:16
Did they invite you?
38:17
Did you reach out to the organization?
38:19
Can you talk a little bit about how that relationship began?
38:22
Yes.
38:23
Well, they weren’t here; that is, those brick and mortar institutions.
38:27
IRCO now is at 15 million dollars a year.
38:30
I mean, we are a big flag ship, and we’re a national model in all the ways I’ve
38:35
just described of actually empowering, engaging, and educating our communities.
38:41
Not to look needy, not to be pitiful, but, you know, we all come from dignified,
38:48
ancient, and elegant cultures that needs to be a part of the American blend-- not
38:53
us as miserable minorities, not at all.
38:56
So these institutions weren’t there then.
39:01
We worked--our firm, Northwest Communities Council, works with
39:06
mutual assistance associations.
39:08
A mutual assistance association can be a Catholic church, you know, it
39:13
can be Oregon Bhutanese Community Organization, it can be Somalia
39:18
American Community of Oregon; these are elder aunties and big uncles in
39:22
our communities who just take charge.
39:24
They don’t get paid for this, it’s their duty—they may be educated,
39:28
they just may be dutiful families, right, they’re responsible people,
39:32
they take charge and they create an organization and off they go.
39:36
They’re the ones who take folks to the emergency room on weekends and
39:41
mediate the problems with police, with teachers, with doctors, and so on.
39:47
So, that’s our law firm connected up with mutual assistance associations,
39:56
mostly from refugee communities—Cubanos, southeast Asians, of course,
40:04
back in those days Romanians, people from former Soviet Union.
40:08
And we hooked up with the elder uncles and big aunties and civic
40:13
activists, and they told me what they needed, and we put that together.
40:17
And, if it’s important enough to you all, you will raise the money to pay
40:21
me, and we’re gonna do this together.
40:23
These are all community cases, we call them impact cases.
40:29
Every immigrant community, whether is Gujaratis who work at Intel and are
40:35
making half a million dollars a year or Mexicanos who have a third or fifth
40:39
grade country education, they have the same cultural conflicts—teenagers and
40:45
parents, parents and schools, families and cops, government rubs of all kinds.
40:53
So,
40:55
MAA’s, on a sliding scale of course of what they could afford,
41:00
would pay me to fashion a remedy for this family’s problem.
41:04
But, actually this family’s problem represents a thousand families’
41:07
problems—we all have this problem, let’s throw in together a chunk of
41:12
change, and we’re gonna take on whoever, we’re gonna go out to the court of
41:15
appeals, we go to the supreme court.
41:17
We’re going to set the mainstream straight about what the rules of
41:22
engagement and what the wealth that we’re gonna blend will be from here forward.
41:28
We’re not going to become, you know, politically submissive.
41:32
That African American-white model, or the white folks and
41:36
the American Indian model, no.
41:38
We tried it already, didn’t work well; we’re not going to do that.
41:43
So that’s the law practice I did.
41:45
And, in that law practice, a number of mutual assistance associations
41:50
got together and created and umbrella group called Southeast
41:54
Asian Refugee Federation—SURF.
41:57
And SURF said, “Oh, well of us together need to create an organization that
42:05
will integrate our folks through jobs, through civic engagement, through
42:11
education, through sports, and all that into the life of the mainstream,”
42:16
and that’s how IRCO was started.
42:18
At the time, there was a publicly funded, sort of, welfare agency
42:22
called Indo-Chinese Cultural and Service Center, got some state
42:29
funds to do employment training and alike.
42:32
So we joined together that state agency with SURF and we created IRCO.
42:40
And IRCO has grown every year about two million dollars a year in the last decade.
42:47
So you were a part of that initial development?
42:49
Yeah, I was the attorney then for the SURF side not for the state side but for the
42:54
SURF side, and put together a board of directors then that was the MAAs directing
43:02
the service delivering—developing it, designing it, and then helping to
43:07
deliver an effective and efficient model.
43:10
And so what years were these?
43:12
How long did this process take?
43:14
Um it was 1980,
43:18
86, I believe, when IRCO really started.
43:22
Now, IRCO will say they started in ’75 or ’78, but that may be SURF or
43:27
it may be Indo-Chinese Cultural and Service Center, you know, the sort
43:31
of parent organizations that combined formally into this brand new 501c3 IRCO.
43:40
And, back then was called Immigrant and Refugee Center of Oregon—International
43:44
Refugee Center of Oregon, same acronym.
43:48
International Refugee Center of Oregon then changed into Immigrant
43:50
and Refugee Community of Oregon.
43:55
But yeah, so I was,
43:59
I’ve been amazingly luckily.
44:00
You know, sometimes when I think back about revolution and expulsion
44:05
and how badly we were treated in the Netherlands ‘cuz we were not welcome,
44:10
you know; 500,000 colored people suddenly showed up in the Netherlands, and they
44:15
were not so happy about this, right.
44:18
After 400 years of imperialism and looking down on us, suddenly, here we are.
44:24
And so, they didn’t want us to stay, and they treated us very badly and
44:27
moved us out without properly giving us all the benefits of citizenship.
44:34
And then we came to Salem, Oregon, for heaven’s sake, which was really
44:38
unready for anything, so bad.
44:44
So, it seems like misfortune, but it’s not.
44:48
You know, I’ve been able to be at just the right places at just the right times,
44:53
which allows me to serve in this very efficient, and I hope effective way,
45:01
the families we really, really care for.
45:04
So then, you started out as the attorney for one of the organizations
45:09
that then combined to become IRCO.
45:11
And, what other roles within the organization have you held?
45:16
Just about every, you know.
45:18
So, I’ve done contract work to do the, sort of, original—back then,
45:24
we called it public participation, but—civic engagement work,
45:29
establishing a sense of place for newcomers that this is your place.
45:34
You know, we now need to secure this neighborhood; we now
45:38
need to calm down landlords.
45:41
Because if, you know in traditional feelings, if the mom is anxious
45:45
about raising her kids, you will not have peace in that home, you
45:48
have to settle the ladies down.
45:51
So landlords have been a problem.
45:55
So that would become an important focus place for IRCO or Asian Family Center to
46:00
try to find some way to make landlords less brutal than they would be if you
46:07
didn’t have a lawyer glaring at them, reminding them what the rules of the
46:11
game are, and then educating our tenants about what Oregon landlord tenant law is.
46:17
I mean, you can’t treat me this way.
46:20
You can’t have wind blowing underneath the door in the winter
46:22
time, you can’t have mold climbing across the carpet and up the wall.
46:27
You know, our folks don’t know this.
46:30
So, I’ve had a board position, I’ve had contract positions where I’m doing legal
46:36
education, I’m doing civic engagement.
46:39
I’m back on the board again now.
46:44
I use IRCO programs to partner with city service providers like cops,
46:51
parks and rec, housing, transportation, you know, sidewalks, streetlamps.
46:56
So we partner IRCO programs, mutual assistance association elders
47:04
and activists and city staff.
47:06
And then, together--like the early stuff I described--together we’re
47:11
going to figure out what the problem is, what you bring to the solution.
47:16
In our communities we have social culture, social capital, cultural capital.
47:20
In the mainstreams we have material capital, we have political capital, we
47:24
have very valuable city services that aren’t getting to our communities.
47:28
When we combine these things and we, together, design, develop,
47:34
and then deliver a very effective city service, everybody’s happy.
47:38
City workers have never worked with Latinos before, never worked Somalis or
47:43
Bhutanese or Burmese or [?] , you name it.
47:46
And you know how it is with us folks—we take you home, we feed you, we put
47:50
the baby on your lap, you know, we tend to be more emotional, more fun.
47:55
And that’s different from white residents who are quite used
48:00
to taking services for granted.
48:02
We get a sidewalk, we have a party.
48:05
We get police protection in these god-awful, grim apartment complex
48:10
blocks, we love those cops—ah, come in, I’ve made you some soup - you know.
48:16
And we want to introduce you to these uncles, to these aunties, right.
48:19
Together, then, we deliver a very valuable city service—recreation
48:25
services, parks we’re building together because we love that stuff.
48:30
On the city side, they’re, now they’re learning how to work
48:33
with us and enjoying our company.
48:36
And on our side, we are committing to the city of Portland, to this neighborhood,
48:41
this block, these politicians, these cops, right, these transportation workers.
48:46
And then, people are getting a sense of place, their place.
48:50
And they want to own it and make it theirs, and they’re not gonna be
48:53
renters, they’re not gonna be refugees, no, they’re gonna be Portlanders.
48:59
So you’re currently a board a member of the Asian Family Center, do you hold other
49:04
roles currently within the organization?
49:06
What are the other ones?
49:07
Yes.
49:08
Yeah, I’m also a board member at the parent organization, IRCO, right.
49:13
So, I can bring those concerns in for our—Asian Family Center
49:18
doesn’t just serve Asians.
49:20
It serves Russian speakers, Islanders, and Africans--mostly east Africans--and
49:25
Asians of course, too, and,
49:32
not that many Latinos, but yeah, certainly some.
49:35
So I--because I’m kind of a street-level problem solver, I
49:42
bring those things to the board.
49:44
Asian Family Center is a service provider; the IRCO board is about board governance,
49:50
about direction of the agency, about fundraising, and what kind of funds to
49:54
raise, or what kind of political future, future coalitions and connections we need
49:59
with other communities with governments.
50:02
So, I’m able to bring that, sort of, street-level
50:07
urgency to policy and political people.
50:12
So, that’s sort of, that’s my role.
50:15
And, since I have a 30-year stake in IRCO, I take it really kind of seriously.
50:22
So, at present, I’m on the board, yeah.
50:24
But also, I’m the partnership builder between IRCO programs and
50:32
city service bureaus.
50:37
So you’re the liaison between the community and the organization
50:41
to make sure that the community’s needs are heard and acted upon?
50:46
Yes.
50:47
And, I facilitate the partnerships, right.
50:49
Get people together, we have huge dinners, we laugh too much, we eat too much, and
50:53
then when we talk together about what’s up in our in our neighborhoods, and what have
50:57
you got that can help us alleviate this.
51:00
Many neighborhoods, for example, are in east, east, east Portland;
51:03
there are no grocery stores.
51:06
You want to go to a grocery store it takes you half a day to bus there.
51:10
And you gotta take all your kids because you have to carry those stupid
51:12
plastic bags to drag back groceries.
51:15
And grandma can do that on the weekends, right, because we don’t like it when
51:18
they do it at night because there’s no streetlamps, there’s no sidewalks.
51:22
So, the city of Portland has a Bureau of Environmental Services, they have
51:26
small garden grants--$10,000 grants.
51:29
We will go find a plot of grass somewhere, and then our elders can go
51:33
out and grow healthy, happy vegetables.
51:36
We will teach them how to grow it organically, and our ridiculously
51:40
entrepreneurial women will go sell them to downtown restaurants,
51:44
to farmers’ markets as organic vegetables and exotic vegetables.
51:49
So, we’re getting all kinds of things as well as environmental stewardship.
51:57
It’s not just that we’re tearing up a church parking lot to do a garden so
52:01
that the water gets filtered when it gets down to the water shed, but we’re also
52:04
getting these elders out of their blues.
52:07
They need to be out of their apartments, they need to be
52:09
together, laughing, growing things; they’re really good at this.
52:13
We need to get our women making money because there’s, they
52:17
don’t have skills to compete.
52:21
And, we need food—healthy, happy food that people are familiar
52:25
with and know how to cook.
52:27
So we’re taking care of all kinds of things, the city gets
52:29
to take credit for all that.
52:31
Good ‘cuz [?] , God loves you, and we get the goodies here, we get the clean water.
52:36
So, these are partnerships where we sit together, you tell me what you need
52:40
out of this, I’ll tell you what I need out of this, and we’re going to do.
52:45
So, thinking about your experiences—you and your family’s experiences when you
52:51
first moved here, and now, several decades later, the experiences that current
52:58
immigrants and refugees are facing, do you see that the needs are the same?
53:02
Have they changed?
53:04
Can you talk a little bit about that?
53:07
The needs are the same.
53:09
Yeah, the needs are the same.
53:12
In fact, in our work, in our community work here, we have been
53:18
through, maybe, four waves now of refugees from different continents.
53:24
And, of course, they’re very different, and each group is profoundly
53:28
beautiful in their own way, but the collision of traditional cultures
53:34
in a highly urbanized, abbreviated, accelerated American mass culture
53:42
is the same, and it is a collision.
53:46
So, the needs are about the same.
53:50
The sorrow of people who’ve left their homelands is the same.
53:56
Many, if not most, of our refugees are deeply wounded people like our
54:03
family, my brother and I, our parents.
54:06
They, you know, you can’t just zip into America and go to work.
54:14
They’re—actually, you can, and you do, and we will, right.
54:18
Our parents just did.
54:20
They didn’t take a breath, they didn’t cry a tear, they just stayed, you know,
54:24
first gear, first gear forward, and ground their way through until their
54:28
kids were dressed nice and educated well.
54:32
And then, our parents crash, you know, a lot younger than they
54:36
should because they are exhausted.
54:39
So that, this is much the same—the grind, the hostility, often times,
54:44
in the neighborhoods where we settle.
54:47
That is, neglected white people are seeing us show up--these are neglected
54:53
white folks, neglected by their political leadership, neglected by their country,
54:57
left behind, and now we show up and our kids go to school dressed really well,
55:03
cuz it’s really important to us, right.
55:05
And our teachers go to school sharpening teachers’ pencils,
55:07
bringing apples, you know.
55:09
And, we do really good in school because our kids are gonna do homework.
55:13
From the first grade on, that’s what you do because we need for you to be
55:17
successful and healthy and wealthy.
55:20
That’s our modus operandi.
55:22
So, we have neighbors mad at us for how resilient we are and
55:28
how, and how ambitious we are.
55:31
This is hard, was hard then, in the 1960s, in the 70s, 80s,
55:37
90s, 2000s, that’s the same.
55:38
So the challenges are about the same.
55:41
We are just so much better armed now because of the Asian Family Center.
55:47
And that’s just one of seven very important community-based
55:50
organizations in Portland
55:56
that create a mediative Chinatown.
55:59
You know, Chinatown is not a location, it’s where you just go and take a deep
56:04
breath and be around people who nurture you until you’re ready, and then you go.
56:10
Right, so we have ethnic enclaves.
56:12
And, these centers, like Asian Family Center, is that place.
56:17
You’re gonna be understood, and you can calm me down, we’re gonna
56:21
reassure you, and reassure you, and reassure you, and reassure you,
56:25
and get you all the things you need
56:29
to be successful.
56:31
So, it sounds like in some specific neighborhoods, the hostility and
56:36
the racism is still very prevalent.
56:40
But, overall, has Portland and Oregon become more welcoming or do you find
56:46
that when your family first came over it wasn’t very welcoming and it still isn’t?
56:52
Yeah, I think it varies from neighborhood to neighborhood.
56:57
We can say with great confidence that in the - in the David
57:01
Douglass school district, which has 70 languages, 60/70 languages,
57:06
it’s like an international school.
57:08
It’s not—in less-diverse neighborhoods, kid culture in
57:14
American is really cruel, you know.
57:17
And, we had to go through this—our brothers and cousins—where we
57:22
had things done to us that would be measure 11 sex crimes now.
57:26
I mean, the perpetrator would go to prison and be a sex offender
57:30
for the rest of your life, right.
57:33
And, I’m certain that this still continues to happen—the bullying,
57:38
the racism as you call it.
57:39
And I don’t even know if it’s racism so much as, you know, in all groups, there’s
57:46
an in group and out group--whether they’re chimpanzees or humans or bonobos, or
57:50
whatever ethnicity, it doesn’t matter.
57:52
And then, there are socially sanctioned target groups for your hostility.
57:58
And, in the past, that’s been race, it’s been black.
58:02
And, it may be Latino, it may be Asian, it may be Arab, it
58:05
may be racial ethnic or not.
58:07
It may just be because you’re different because you got curry for lunch in
58:12
little tins instead of sandwiches, right.
58:14
Kids are that way—they, there’s in group and out group.
58:18
And then, you know, you can be miserably out with no way in.
58:23
So, there’s a whole range of, what we call, receiving
58:27
community environments from very super-duper, like David Douglass.
58:32
We’re so proud of David Douglass school district.
58:34
They do so great work with so little money, you know.
58:39
And our parents love the school, they spend time there, they
58:43
think of the school as their community center, as their school.
58:46
Teachers treat families with real respect, not just kids, but families.
58:52
They talk to parents even though the parents speak no English, you know.
58:56
You can’t talk to a kid, it’s undignified, right.
58:59
You can’t talk to my kid instead of me when I come for a parent meeting and ask
59:03
my kid to tell me what you just said.
59:06
I’ve been one of those kids, I will lie, you know.
59:09
I mean, that’s really wrong, you need to have professional translator there;
59:13
explain, you know, that the parent is the authority figure, not the child.
59:18
So, David Douglass is creating a much more welcoming, international
59:23
cosmopolitan community for their children to learn in, all children.
59:29
Some schools not.
59:31
But I would imagine that the level of violence, the level of bullying is a
59:36
lot the same where the circumstances are the same as when we first came to Salem.
59:44
And the, the communities that, that move here—and, perhaps, you can
59:48
only speak to your own personal experience—but, you and your family,
59:54
did you ever think of moving elsewhere?
59:57
Or, when communities come here, when family members come here, do they
1:00:01
find that they want to stay or does it just, maybe it depends on the
1:00:06
individual group, but as a whole, do the communities like to stay in Oregon?
1:00:08
This is—this is an excellent question, this is actually a—this is a big question,
1:00:14
issue in human migrations, which is an international discipline, right.
1:00:19
And the patterns are much the same everywhere.
1:00:22
The answer yes, folks want to move, if they can, to where others like them are.
1:00:28
So, that model of immigrant or refugee resettlement that we came
1:00:33
under, that is, disperse these people around so they Americanize really
1:00:36
rapidly is really not best practices.
1:00:41
That’s how you create poverty, that’s how you create forever marginality
1:00:45
of the kind we experienced when we first arrived as teenagers.
1:00:48
You were forever in the rut over there.
1:00:51
The better model is the Chinatown model where people come and all be together
1:00:57
because together we raise children, together we keep community standards
1:01:01
this high, we don’t get into street culture, we don’t get into drugs, or we
1:01:05
get—you know, we brow beat each other constantly about how much money you’re
1:01:09
making and how what level of Toyota or Honda or Acura, you’re now at, right.
1:01:14
This is so central to traditional people, this competing and comparing.
1:01:20
So, we—people do move, and my mom’s sisters moved to California where
1:01:27
there were a lot more Indos and grocery stores and entertainment
1:01:32
and alike, and some stayed here.
1:01:36
And you will see all over the United States, once families come, they will
1:01:40
move to where there’s other folks from their region, from their village,
1:01:45
from their state, from their country.
1:01:46
Now, about Portland, Portland is 11th largest refugee resettlement
1:01:53
city in the United States.
1:01:54
We’re the 50th largest city, but we are the 11th highest population.
1:01:58
So there’s—Portland, because of things like IRCO, because of the MAAs
1:02:04
that feed IRCO, has become, has an international reputation for compassion.
1:02:11
And, that’s combination of Catholic Charities of Oregon, Lutheran Community
1:02:16
Services Northwest, Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon, sort of faith
1:02:20
community that sponsors people.
1:02:23
It’s a combination of MAAs taking care of people, dutiful big uncles and
1:02:27
aunties in communities, it’s the CBOs that grow out of that, and then it’s
1:02:31
the partnerships between the CBOs and local government--Multnomah County
1:02:36
and City of Portland--so that they trust us to serve our people well.
1:02:42
And we enter into partnerships or you just give us the money, we’ll take care of it.
1:02:45
And the county’s had that position, right; “Oh god, we don’t know about Africans,
1:02:50
let’s just give the money to Africa house.” Cuz, you’re gonna be wasting
1:02:53
money if you’re not from that ethnic group and you have no idea of that person’s
1:02:58
experience. To say nothing if you don’t have language skills, you know, in the 18
1:03:05
African languages we speak in Portland.
1:03:07
So that perception of Portland, do you think that really good reputation
1:03:15
began to really emerge in the late 80s, 90s when IRCO really was established?
1:03:23
Yes, that’s right.
1:03:23
Yes.
1:03:23
Because it sounds like when you first, you and your family first came,
1:03:27
Oregon did not have that reputation.
1:03:29
No.
1:03:29
Yeah, we didn’t have the infrastructure.
1:03:31
The informal infrastructure of MAAs is always there, right, because people
1:03:36
just—if you go to any east Oregon city, and you find yourself a Mexican café,
1:03:42
and you will find them, and you ask them, “who’s the abuela, you know, who’s the
1:03:44
grandma around here? “Oh yeah,” you know, “Senora Sanchez, she lives right over
1:03:48
there.” You know, she will know everybody in town and everyone will respect her as
1:03:51
a sort of community leader. So there’s informal systems have been everywhere.
1:03:55
We took that next step of formalizing those little mini organizations
1:04:02
under one umbrella, SURF.
1:04:04
Umbrella connected up then with a brick and mortar, state
1:04:07
public-funded organization, now we’re bringing in tons of money.
1:04:13
So the—we have really developed an immigrant and refugee resettlement
1:04:19
model that’s very successful, and that’s what draws so many people to Portland.
1:04:24
So, folks who come here usually don’t really leave.
1:04:27
IRCO does a really good job in many ways--in many ways it doesn’t, but--
1:04:33
of getting people to work right away.
1:04:35
Refugees have eight months to get self-sufficient, eight
1:04:39
months, eight months, you know.
1:04:43
It’s unbelievable because when I started this work, they got 36 months.
1:04:48
So then you have a chance to learn English and you don’t take the first
1:04:52
job at the window factory or the coffin factory, at the rag factory,
1:04:57
at the metal coating factory, you know, because people tend to get stuck
1:05:01
at those jobs and not treated well.
1:05:04
But, we have eight months to get people to work, and we get them to work.
1:05:07
And, somehow or other, this combination of MAAs and CBOs and
1:05:13
governments working together has been a really, pretty successful draw.
1:05:19
Portland’s this way.
1:05:20
We draw homeless from all over the country, right, because of a
1:05:24
reputation for compassion and for caring for people, and the same is
1:05:28
true for refugees and immigrants.
1:05:31
So, over the years it sounds like you’ve been able to change policies,
1:05:37
change laws that the county, the governments trust these organizations
1:05:42
to do what they need to do.
1:05:44
Have there been challenges over the years or has, at some point, are there
1:05:49
examples of things that you’ve wanted to change, but there’s been resistance?
1:05:55
Um, there’s always resistance to change, and we’re not [?] by it, and we are
1:06:00
actually quite good at getting over it.
1:06:05
We’re now in a new round of getting government to be, to commit even better.
1:06:13
Right, Portland, if we just take this city, is 500,000 people,
1:06:18
100,000 are foreign born—100,000.
1:06:21
Half of the kids go home to ethnic minority families, half.
1:06:26
So you can see where this is going.
1:06:29
And yet, government’s response to that is not, is not, is not
1:06:36
parity, it’s not equitable.
1:06:39
We have it in the literature of immigrant integration, you have it 8--6, 8, 10 years
1:06:45
to integrate people into the mainstream or else they will disintegrate into poverty.
1:06:51
And if you want to do that, just say so right up front, and we will
1:06:54
start suing each other like crazy.
1:06:56
We will force government to take care of our families, or we can do it the
1:07:01
way we do it, which is by forming partnerships, urging, urging, urging
1:07:07
government to get closer to us.
1:07:09
Letting them experience what a joy it is to work with immigrants.
1:07:12
God, we’re so fun, we’re so funny, we eat too much, you know, and
1:07:17
everything, work is like play to us, you know, we’re so enthusiastic about
1:07:20
democracy and government caring about us, you didn’t have that back home.
1:07:25
So, we’re now in another phase of having, asking government to get even more serious
1:07:30
and more committed to what we’re doing.
1:07:32
It can’t be our work all the time, we now have to share it up more
1:07:37
evenly because the demographics have shifted so dramatically
1:07:41
that government’s not keeping up.
1:07:43
We’re not getting people engaged within that ten year time frame.
1:07:47
And after, if you don’t do that, after that, families start to disintegrate—men
1:07:52
start to feel humiliated, they lose their hope, their dreaming becomes a
1:07:56
nightmare, they drink, and they punch somebody, either at work, at the bar,
1:08:01
or their wife, or their teenage boy.
1:08:03
And, from there on out, it’s gonna get much more expensive.
1:08:06
So, we can integrate by design, as I’ve explained it, or we can integrate
1:08:11
by default, which is public welfare, child welfare systems, juvenile
1:08:17
justice, adult criminal systems.
1:08:19
Those are very expensive, much more expensive than our partnership work.
1:08:24
So, now we’re in a new phase of, kind of, yes, resistance from institutions
1:08:32
because now we’re asking more, and now our numbers are profoundly more.
1:08:38
For that reason, the Coalition of Communities of Color has got together with
1:08:42
PSU, and we’ve built up this huge database
1:08:48
of what’s up with us, how our numbers have changed, how the city of Seattle
1:08:53
and the city of San Francisco have got…
1:09:00
[interruption] …We now have the data that shows extraordinary disparities
1:09:05
between all our ethnic streams and the mainstream, not just black and white but
1:09:12
all of us compared to the mainstream.
1:09:14
And then when you compare that to King county and the city of Seattle, when you
1:09:19
compare that to the county and city of San Francisco, we’re doing much, much worse in
1:09:25
outcomes in Portland—educational outcomes, health outcomes, wealth, and so on.
1:09:31
So, someone needs to explain this to us.
1:09:33
Why is it they’re doing better than we are when you compare the data?
1:09:38
And now, we have the data, we’re not just saying it’s bad,
1:09:41
we’re now showing it to you.
1:09:42
So, this opens up a whole new dialogue about what’s Seattle
1:09:46
doing—same demographics, 500,000 people, 20% percent foreign-born.
1:09:51
Their foreign born is about
1:09:55
18, they are older than we are, our foreign-borns are younger, so we
1:10:00
have actually more urgency here.
1:10:02
So how come they’re doing so well there compared to us?
1:10:05
Let’s have a look at that, and let’s start working on that together.
1:10:08
Our communities are in there with you.
1:10:10
You know, you lead, we follow.
1:10:12
We love this democracy stuff.
1:10:14
So, yes, we’re at a time now of more resistance than usual, but it’s because
1:10:20
the demographics have shifted dramatically and we are actually asking more of local
1:10:26
government than we’ve ever asked before.
1:10:28
We always have an attitude, all the A groups—Africans, Asians,
1:10:33
Arabs, and our kind of Latinos, we just take care of it, you know.
1:10:40
Problem, I’ll just take care of it.
1:10:41
We don’t think that government should be taking care of us; we
1:10:45
just take care of our own problem.
1:10:46
So, we’re starting to say, “oh no, we can’t take care of it in our MAA levels;
1:10:51
we’re exhausting our elder aunties and uncles.” Our CBOs are working three
1:10:55
times harder than any other employee, but we need help from the mainstream
1:11:02
because these are public issues, not just our issues, these are public issues.
1:11:07
So over the years, the needs have remained the same, it’s just
1:11:11
greater numbers at this point.
1:11:14
Yes.
1:11:14
And you see those numbers growing even more in the coming years?
1:11:17
Oh gosh.
1:11:18
Oh yeah, of course.
1:11:19
This is a Spasian coast, right, Spanish-speaking, Asian coast, or Latino
1:11:24
coast—just a mix of Latinos and Asians.
1:11:27
And we’re very vigorous communities; we’re a little impatient, you know.
1:11:31
We are boundlessly optimistic, right.
1:11:34
And we love this America stuff; it’s so great compared to back home.
1:11:39
You can work here, three shifts if you want to.
1:11:42
Where I come from, or my Mexican, or my cousins’ Mexican wives
1:11:46
come from, there’s no jobs.
1:11:49
Even if you wanted to work, there’s no money to be made.
1:11:52
But here, you can work like crazy.
1:11:53
Now, they’re really awful jobs, right.
1:11:56
But, that’s okay because you’re gonna hand that money to your wife, and
1:12:00
she’s gonna dress up your kids, and they’re gonna go to school, and they’re
1:12:02
gonna be great—no doubt about it.
1:12:05
What’s more, you’re kid’s American born, phew, no problem—no
1:12:09
papers, no problem, right.
1:12:12
I have all kinds documentation problems, but my kids are cool.
1:12:17
So, yeah, it’s harder now
1:12:23
because the numbers are more difficult and our demands are
1:12:26
greater now than ever before.
1:12:28
And, we’re much more sophisticated and savvy about participating in
1:12:33
the mainstream than we were before.
1:12:35
We’re no longer happy just to have the, the manual labor jobs like our fathers
1:12:40
did, you know, and the humiliation of it.
1:12:43
It’s impossible for me, I’m a smart-alicky lawyer, you know.
1:12:48
I can’t go there anymore.
1:12:50
I’m really impatient with the way the gas station worker treats me, you know.
1:12:53
I mean, I’m gonna step out of the car and punch you.
1:12:56
I’m expecting the policeman to treat me with respect and dignity.
1:13:00
Now, in my parents’ generation, that was okay.
1:13:05
So this is a two-part question.
1:13:07
Um, thinking back to 20, 30 years and what your hopes were, your expectations,
1:13:13
your vision for the future, if you could talk a little bit about that and if those
1:13:19
expectations have been exceeded or not.
1:13:21
And then, after that, thinking about your vision for the next 20 or so
1:13:27
years and what your hopes are for that.
1:13:28
So, first, looking back, if you can think back to what you were hoping
1:13:33
for, you know, when you first moved to Portland, when you were first
1:13:36
helping establish IRCO, all of that.
1:13:39
Yes.
1:13:41
Well, you know,
1:13:45
I have to say I never had a vision.
1:13:50
I really have not been burdened by expectations a lot.
1:13:55
And, some of it is ethno-cultural because we tend to be more present-oriented and
1:14:01
we tend to be more social-orientated than whatever the other thing is.
1:14:07
So, if I’m in your company and we are happy, you know,
1:14:13
I’m happy as can be, you know.
1:14:16
In our culture, we don’t really have careers.
1:14:19
I never thought of, you know, I’m down there, I’m going to be a lawyer 20 years
1:14:25
from now, 15; it never occurred to me.
1:14:28
So the journey looks a little zig-zagy because it is, because it was.
1:14:33
But I wasn’t harmed by it.
1:14:35
In fact, it was very good for me, and it happens to have turned out very good for
1:14:41
the people I serve, given the skills I have collected over that wiggly journey.
1:14:48
So, I can’t say that it’s less than I expected or more than I expected.
1:14:55
I’m just really happy to be living and to be educated and to have educated
1:15:00
children and lovely grandchildren.
1:15:03
I don’t know what to say.
1:15:04
Our mother’s really, really cared for by all of our brothers, you know.
1:15:08
And, our father’s passed away, and we’ll never stop loving him.
1:15:13
So, I’m fine with the last 10, 20 years.
1:15:18
Looking forward, because now I’m an educated wise guy, you know, and
1:15:25
Americanized in some unattractive ways, I do have expectations.
1:15:30
And, again, this is contrary to our cultures because expectations lead to
1:15:34
heartbreak, right, and we don’t do that.
1:15:37
And we, you know, in our country we’re [?] , it’s
1:15:46
a kind of Islam, so we trust that God would love us.
1:15:51
And we just do the best we can, and your love in this universe is grand and a
1:15:56
beautiful production, and it will be fine.
1:15:59
But, I do worry some about that 10-year window within which our families have
1:16:09
to engage economically and civically in the life of wherever they’re living.
1:16:16
And that I do worry that America is so preoccupied with things other
1:16:21
than that, and that this is going to cause a great amount of grief,
1:16:28
conflict in fact.
1:16:30
I worry a lot about the racism in America and the stuck family fight between
1:16:37
African America and white America, and how much creativity, how much love that
1:16:43
squanders, how much money that just takes away from our national pride.
1:16:52
That is a very stuck family fight, and white America can’t turn their attention
1:16:58
to brown America because of the paralysis of this cruelty, of this brutality,
1:17:05
and the rage of the victims of it.
1:17:08
So, we squander so much creativity and just plain love and time
1:17:14
on that unresolved wound.
1:17:18
And, it’s a family fight, and family members know how to hurt each other,
1:17:22
you know, and stay stuck in it.
1:17:24
For us newcomers here, looking at
1:17:29
it, we’re going, “Oh, wow, wow that’s bitter.” You know, we are so sorry for
1:17:30
you all. But really, it’s not our fight.
1:17:34
We will never say no to any of you, we will take you with us, but you guys need
1:17:38
to, you know, make right with each other because its killing the rest of us.
1:17:45
The institutionalized racialized ruts in the legal system, for example, that
1:17:50
I’m a part of are deep and impossible.
1:17:54
Oh my gosh, Ferguson is just code, right.
1:17:57
Ferguson is code for Watts, Watts 2, Rodney King, you know, and all
1:18:01
the other murders and awfulness of that regime that keeps in check
1:18:06
that awful black-white family fight.
1:18:10
Terrible, it’s so ugly.
1:18:13
So, I worry about that and America’s ability to deal both with that black-white
1:18:21
problem and then the brown issue because we really don’t want to be in that.
1:18:26
But, we will be taken down by it, for sure—the racism.
1:18:34
So that’s my biggest worry, that I can’t get political leaders to be proud of us.
1:18:40
They can’t use the “I” word—immigrant—whether they are
1:18:42
national, state, or local leaders.
1:18:44
They can’t say immigrant because the voters won’t dig it, you know.
1:18:49
And then, we’ll get into a shoving match about who needs
1:18:53
that white money more, black or white, as if it’s a zero sum game.
1:18:59
This really, really, concerns me, and so, the next step of American
1:19:04
development--what is America going to be?
1:19:07
And we, kind of, have to insist as Asians and Latinos that we have to create a new
1:19:13
ethos that we bring, you know, with our generosity, with our open heartedness,
1:19:18
with our familia, right, with our faith.
1:19:22
That is so stuck.
1:19:23
And
1:19:26
America’s, just, America’s creativity is enormous, right, it’s just awesome.
1:19:32
But, that creativity, when it comes to this problem, it is just paralyzed,
1:19:37
just paralyzed because of the guilt and the rage between those two people.
1:19:42
So, that’s my concern, and I don’t know, I’m 60 now, if that can be something I
1:19:51
can contribute to resolving so we can move on and be a great nation again.
1:19:57
Right, the rest of the world kind of looks down on us, they think, “Oh shit,
1:20:01
these Americans, man. Their racism is so barbaric.” You know, you can’t get
1:20:07
off that level until you solve this.
1:20:13
So that’s my expectation for the future—to find us a way for black and
1:20:18
brown and white to move forward together.
1:20:20
I believe we’re the answer, we’ve got the energy for that, we’re not stuck by it.
1:20:26
So, you have hope?
1:20:27
Oh yes.
1:20:29
Yeah.
1:20:30
Yeah, of course, yeah.
1:20:32
Alhamdulillah, thanks to God.
1:20:39
So, is there anything that we have not discussed that you would
1:20:43
like to share or anything that you’d like to talk more about?
1:20:48
No, that was a pretty--that was a pretty global, wide-ranging spin.
1:20:59
Maybe just one other thing about that: And, I think the only difference in
1:21:04
the way I express myself and the story I tell, or the journey we’ve talked
1:21:08
about or you’ve asked about here, is that I’m able to articulate it.
1:21:13
I think this is pretty much
1:21:17
the truth for all 100,000 of those foreign-born Portlanders.
1:21:24
You know, whatever percent of the population nationally or state-wide
1:21:28
is foreign-born, it’s the same story.
1:21:31
You know, we are not sad, dirty people who come on a big boat to America and,
1:21:38
you know, and didn’t have anything before they came as they say on that narrative
1:21:42
- you know, give me your unwashed, your humble, your stinky, your uncool, and
1:21:46
yearning to be free, that’s nonsense.
1:21:48
That’s never been true, never.
1:21:51
Whether the people came from Italia or Ireland or España or Indonesia
1:21:56
or China or India, we come from 4,000 year old civilizations.
1:21:59
We are very sophisticated, very civil, very humble people with deep love for each
1:22:06
other, for God, for our Earth, you know.
1:22:11
And so, what I’ve just explained to you has been the unraveling of
1:22:15
my awareness that that’s how I am.
1:22:23
And that’s how everybody is.
1:22:24
Had I followed the mainstream narrative about who I’m supposed to be, working
1:22:29
under the hood of a Chevy, you know.
1:22:32
I’m always the guy that gets stopped by the cops, it’s always
1:22:34
me and somebody else at the airport sitting in a special line, you know.
1:22:38
If that had been the narrative I followed, I would be reduced to being,
1:22:42
you know, an oppressed, angry, somebody.
1:22:45
I’d probably be in prison because I have lost my temper a few
1:22:48
times, and, luckily, I know how to maneuver and not end up in prison.
1:22:55
But,
1:22:58
the journey I’ve just explained to you about our families back home, you know,
1:23:03
the values we bring with us, and how we now move around from here and home
1:23:08
all the time, that’s the new America, and that’s actually the old immigrant
1:23:14
story of all of us if we were just given the chance to take pride in ourselves.
1:23:20
You know, and being amongst ourselves and talk this through, if we were educated
1:23:24
in the same way I have been, and can conceptualize now, the whole thing,
1:23:29
the whole journey, the back and forths, the “oh, gotta leave the country, don’t
1:23:32
want to be in the army,” “oh, gotta get out of this country, they’re going
1:23:35
to kill me,” you know, “oh, gotta move out of here because they don’t want us
1:23:37
here.” That whole thing is our story, and the resilience behind it, the love
1:23:42
behind it, the commitment to each other.
1:23:45
So, I think, I’m no different, I’m just lucky, you know, that I got into
1:23:49
university and then got into law school.
1:23:53
It wasn’t because I’m particularly smart, you know, or I score well at
1:23:58
admission exams, because I don’t.
1:24:00
You know, I’m the funky guy they let in if you can prove to us
1:24:04
during your probationary years that you’re, that you should be here.
1:24:11
Yeah.
1:24:11
So I think that’s the sort of thing I would draw from all this, that we all have
1:24:14
exactly the same story, and I’m only able to articulate because I’ve been lucky.
1:24:21
But, and I sit around dinner tables with Mexican gentlemen with third grade
1:24:24
educations, and they are so civil.
1:24:28
They are so proper and courteous, and I love those gentlemen.
1:24:32
And they’re 10, 20 years older than me; their hands are broken
1:24:35
from having worked so hard.
1:24:37
They’re skin is all cracked.
1:24:39
My best friend’s dad had his arm smashed in an iron machine on purpose because he
1:24:48
couldn’t work anymore, and he got a huge payout because he’s permanently disabled.
1:24:54
He did this on purpose, right, so that he could give money to his kids so they
1:24:59
could buy these houses in 1980s, houses that are now worth half a million dollars.
1:25:05
Wow.
1:25:07
Right, so,
1:25:10
well, I don’t think I’m up to putting my hand into a metal stamper at work, but I
1:25:16
think it goes to show how grand we are.
1:25:21
And then, we want to make America this grand.
1:25:26
So, any other closing thoughts that you’d like the share?
1:25:30
No, I wouldn’t know what it would be.
1:25:33
But thank you for your confidence in our work,
1:25:37
you know, [?] a voice for us.
1:25:40
Well, thank you for sharing your story and for, for your voice.
1:25:45
It’s wonderful.
