00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández, and I am the Oregon Multicultural librarian
00:07
for the Oregon Multicultural Archives at Oregon State University’s Special
00:11
Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:13
Today’s date is January 14th, 2015, and we are conducting an oral history
00:20
interview as part of the IRCO Asian Family Center oral history project.
00:26
So let’s get started.
00:27
If you could please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:31
My name is Sivai: S-I-V-A-I.
00:36
Middle name is Folausaua: F-O-L-A-U-S-A-U-A.
00:43
Last name is Bennett: B-E-N-N-E-T-T.
00:48
And what is your birthdate and birthplace?
00:52
I was born in American Samoa in 1960.
01:00
And, with which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
01:05
I am Samoan.
01:07
And when and where were your parents born?
01:10
My mother was born on the island of Upolu in Independent Samoa.
01:16
And my father was born on the island of Aunu’u, which is part of American Samoa.
01:23
My mother was born in June 10th, 1927, and my father was born on March 19th, 1920.
01:36
And where was it that you grew up?
01:38
I grew up in American Samoa, which is a U.S. territory.
01:43
However, my mother was born and raised in the western islands of Upolu.
01:52
And so, how long were you there?
01:55
I was born and raised in Samoa.
01:58
I left when I was 18 years old to come to college here in Oregon.
02:05
I spent two years at Eastern Oregon University and then later transferred
02:12
to the University of Oregon.
02:17
And did you come here by yourself?
02:19
Did you have relatives here?
02:20
Why did you choose Oregon?
02:22
I came to Oregon by myself because when I was in the seventh grade, I had
02:28
a pen pal, her name was Vicky Pierce.
02:32
She was a student in Beaverton, and she and I, we corresponded with each other.
02:41
We were pen pals from when I was seventh grade until I was in, uh,
02:47
I was a senior in high school.
02:49
And, she and I—I became interested in coming to school in Oregon
02:56
because of my friend, Vicky.
03:00
And so, did you always know that you wanted to come to the continental
03:05
United States, and specifically Oregon, based on that relationship?
03:09
Yes.
03:11
In 1971,
03:15
my eldest brother and, uh, left our country to come to the United States
03:23
down in Los Angeles as a college student.
03:26
And so, we were told by our parents that all of us would have the opportunity
03:31
to come to the United States for college after we completed high school.
03:36
So I knew at age 11 that I would be coming to the United States to
03:41
go to college after high school.
03:44
And then, in 1978 after I graduated from high school, I left my
03:51
island, and my eldest sister traveled to Los Angeles with me.
03:58
And I spent about two weeks in Los Angeles, and then I
04:03
flew to Portland by myself.
04:06
And from Portland I took another airplane to Pendleton, and then a professor
04:13
and his wife from the University of Eastern Oregon University came to
04:20
Pendleton to pick me up from the airport.
04:23
I was a student at the University of Oregon [Eastern Oregon University]
04:26
from 1978 to 1980, and then, from there, I transferred to the
04:33
University of Oregon and completed my undergraduate studies there.
04:38
And what was it that you studied?
04:40
I studied political science.
04:44
And did you know that going in when you first started college or
04:47
did you switch majors a few times?
04:50
Uh, hm.
04:53
That’s a very good question because when I was in high school
04:58
I wanted to become a teacher.
05:03
But my parents—my father was, when my father first started working, he
05:09
was a teacher and the principle for,
05:14
in American
05:17
Samoa.
05:18
But he told his children, and me included, that teachers do not earn enough.
05:28
There’s a lot of work that goes into being a teacher, and so, because I
05:34
was a student leader in high school, my parents told me that I should come
05:42
to college and study to be a lawyer.
05:45
My father was a legal practitioner.
05:49
He was like a lawyer.
05:51
He was, he was licensed to
05:56
represent clients in court for land and title cases.
06:03
And
06:06
so, my parents wanted me to come to college and study to become a
06:12
lawyer, but my heart was in teaching.
06:16
So, I became a school teacher at age 25, and my first job was teaching
06:26
high school back in American Samoa where I was born and raised.
06:32
And, currently, I’m teaching fifth and sixth graders at Harold Oliver
06:39
Elementary School in the Centennial School District here in Portland.
06:45
So let’s a talk a little bit more about your time in Oregon.
06:48
Was it what you imagined when you came here and studied here?
06:52
Was it what you expected or was it very different?
06:55
What was it like?
06:58
It was very—I was very homesick when I arrived in La Grande.
07:06
I was the only student from—I was the only Samoan student.
07:11
There were many students from the Micronesian Islands,
07:18
so I felt very lonely.
07:20
I was not fluent in English, and it was very difficult because of the language.
07:31
And also, I remember, I can remember going to my classes, and there
07:37
were some professors who were,
07:42
they were,
07:46
they knew that it was difficult for foreign students to
07:50
keep up with the English.
07:53
So, I had one professor, her name is Sister Alberta Dieker --she’s still
07:59
living, I think she’s in her 90s,--and she would have a study groups to
08:07
go over the materials before exams.
08:10
But I—there were classes that I took that there were things that
08:14
I didn’t understand, English words that I didn’t understand.
08:18
So, it was very difficult.
08:21
The first two years was very difficult because of the language barrier.
08:28
And then, why did you decide to transfer to the University of Oregon?
08:31
Was it for the program, or?
08:33
Uh.
08:33
Yes, the program.
08:34
Because when I left home, I was, even though I interested in becoming a
08:43
teacher, but I was following my parents’ wishes for me to go to law school.
08:50
And so, I shared that with my academic advisor at Eastern Oregon State
08:59
College, and I told him that I was, that I needed to take classes that
09:09
would help me get into law school.
09:11
And so, my advisor, Dr. Harvey Bennett, told me that it would be
09:19
good for me to at least spend two years taking prerequisite classes at
09:24
Eastern Oregon State College and then transfer to the University of Oregon.
09:29
And, Dr. Bennett also told me that there are three law schools
09:36
in the state of Oregon—University of Oregon, Lewis and Clark Law
09:41
School, and Willamette Law School.
09:45
And, he said that Lewis and Clark Law Schools, their tuition was
09:51
higher than the University of Oregon.
09:55
And so, his recommendation for me was to transfer to the University
10:00
of Oregon, and that was what I did.
10:03
I transferred to U of O. I took political science courses, history, and I also took
10:12
a class to prepare me for the L-S-A-T.
10:19
But, I met my husband there; he was a law student at the University of Oregon.
10:26
And so, we got married, and then we moved back to La Grande, where he was from.
10:38
And he was working there, and I went back to college and start taking classes for,
10:48
to become an elementary school teacher.
10:52
And, where was this, what college did you go to for that?
10:54
Eastern Oregon University College.
10:57
Wait, Eastern Oregon State College is now Eastern Oregon University in La Grande.
11:06
So you received your Masters there?
11:08
Uh no.
11:09
I received my Master’s degree from the University of Portland in 2003.
11:16
And,
11:20
I also received my—I am a certified teacher, so I received my degree
11:29
and became a certified teacher.
11:33
So I can teach K through 8 self-contained classrooms.
11:40
And, right now, I’m teaching fifth grade at Harold Oliver Elementary School
11:45
in the Centennial School District.
11:48
Well, let’s talk a little bit about the journey that you took
11:52
from college up until this point.
11:54
So, you mentioned that around age 25 you moved back home?
11:58
Yes.
11:58
And you were married, so you moved back home with your
12:01
husband, and he met your family?
12:03
And, how long did you live there, and what was it like going back?
12:06
Yes.
12:06
Yes.
12:06
Um, we went back—I went back to Samoa, and my husband, and, of course, my
12:14
husband came with me and our four month year, four month old daughter.
12:22
Her name is Sineva, she’s 30 years old now, she’s a lawyer.
12:26
And so, it
12:30
was a wonderful experience for me--I was very happy to go back home, and
12:39
my mom helped raise my daughter while I was working full time.
12:44
And, we were there from 1984 to
12:52
1988.
12:53
My husband was the chief prosecutor in the Attorney General’s Office,
12:59
and I was a high school teacher.
13:01
I taught English, Samoan history, U.S. history, world
13:06
history, and U.S. government.
13:09
And then, from there, our family moved to Southern California, and I became
13:17
an elementary school teacher in the Catholic schools in El Centro, California,
13:22
about 120 miles East of San Diego.
13:27
And how long did you and your family live there?
13:29
We were in El Centro for ten years.
13:32
And then, from there, we moved back to Oregon and we’ve been
13:37
living here in Oregon since 1998.
13:42
And here in Portland?
13:44
In Portland.
13:45
So, about 16 years, 1998.
13:49
My son started—well, my son was in third grade when we first moved to Portland,
13:57
and our daughter was in, started high school at Central Catholic High School.
14:06
And Christopher, our son, attended Holy Family Catholic elementary school.
14:13
And Christopher Michael Fa’afetai is 25 years old, and our
14:20
daughter, Sineva Marie, is 30
14:25
years old.
14:25
Great.
14:26
Can you talk a little bit about your mentors that you’ve had along the way,
14:32
whether personal or professional or both?
14:34
You mentioned a few advisors that assisted you and anyone that comes
14:39
to mind in terms of mentorship and guiding you along your path?
14:42
Yes.
14:45
My parents are my foremost mentors.
14:51
Can
15:02
we take a…
15:07
So, in terms of your mentors, let’s talk a little bit about your personal
15:12
and professional mentors that you’ve had over the course of your life.
15:17
My very first mentors are my parents.
15:22
My late father was Folausaua Teofilo and my mother, who’s
15:28
still living in Samoa, is Sineva.
15:32
And, to me, they are my first mentors—they raised me, they taught me all that
15:41
I needed to know, and still continue to learn from my mother--especially
15:46
the history, the oral history.
15:50
My culture is based on oral history, and so, stories, history is always passed
15:56
down from generation to generation.
16:04
My other mentors growing up in Samoa are my aunts and uncles
16:09
and my teachers and the minister.
16:14
I was raised in a Protestant family household.
16:18
My mother, although—although my mother was raised in a Catholic
16:23
family, when she married my father, who was a son of a minister, she
16:29
became a Protestant and raised her children in the Protestant church.
16:40
My high school teachers played a major role in my education.
16:48
And, I wanted to become a teacher because of my high school teachers,
16:54
they were wonderful teachers.
16:56
Some of my teachers—a couple of teachers that I really appreciated
17:02
their help were a couple from
17:09
Connecticut, Richard and Sandy Behan.
17:14
They were my science teachers in high school.
17:17
My Samoan teachers also became my mentors, and they were the ones that
17:24
encouraged me to come to America and to get my education in America.
17:31
They too also came to America.
17:35
They were educated in the United States, and then they returned
17:38
home to teach in high school.
17:41
And, I had a few—I also had some American teachers that taught me in English.
17:54
And so, when I came to Eastern Oregon University, my very first
18:00
mentor was Dr. Harvey Bennett, who later became my father-in-law.
18:06
And he was one of several mentors I had in college.
18:12
My other mentors included Sister Alberta Dieker, that I mentioned
18:16
earlier, she was my history professor, and also had another professor
18:23
who was, who taught anthropology, and he became my mentor as well.
18:31
When I went to the University of Oregon, I had a couple professors
18:36
there that were my mentors.
18:38
I was admitted to the University of Portland in 2001, and, I would say, I
18:47
had three very close mentors there—Dr.
18:55
Ellen Arwood, Dr. Lee Golden, and Dr. Juan Flores, who
19:05
is from Guam.
19:07
Those three people were the main professors that helped me decide
19:13
what’s going—attending, while I was attending the University of
19:17
Portland, and working towards my M-A-T, Master of Arts in Teaching.
19:27
I graduated—I finished the program in 2003.
19:33
And can you share a little bit about what happened, your parents’ reaction,
19:38
support when you decided that you wanted to pursue becoming a teacher
19:43
rather than what they had originally hoped, which was you becoming a lawyer?
19:48
Can you talk a little bit about that?
19:49
Yes.
19:49
Well, they were, my parents were very pleased that I married a lawyer, and
19:56
they also were pleased with my choice.
19:59
When I moved to—when my husband, our daughter, and I moved back
20:04
to Samoa, they were very proud of us—proud of me as a teacher and of
20:11
Michael, my husband, as a lawyer.
20:14
And they were just thankful and proud that we were willing to come home and
20:21
work and help with the family obligations.
20:26
So.
20:27
So
20:34
then, in terms of your process of becoming a citizen of the United States, can you
20:39
share a little bit about that story?
20:41
Yes.
20:42
So, I’m from American Samoa, which a U.S. citizen [territory]
20:46
—I was born and raised there.
20:49
And, people who were born in American Samoa, like myself, we are U.S. nationals.
20:58
In other words,
21:01
we’re not U.S. citizens.
21:04
And U.S. nationals can travel to the United States, and U.S.
21:09
nationals can also join the military.
21:13
And so, the big difference between a U.S. national and a U.S. citizen is that
21:22
U.S. citizens can vote in the United States, but not U.S. nationals.
21:28
And so, I became a, um, naturalized citizen.
21:35
I applied for naturalization while I was living in El Centro,
21:40
California, in the early ‘90s.
21:45
And, when I applied to become a U.S. citizen, to be naturalized citizen,
21:52
I didn’t have to take the test.
21:54
The test that is normally given to immigrants when they’re applying
22:01
for citizenship was waived.
22:04
And so, that test
22:10
was never, I mean, I was not required to take a test.
22:16
So the whole process was relatively simple, didn’t take too much time
22:20
by the time, between the time you applied and when you actually became
22:23
naturalized, that process was…?
22:25
Yes, correct.
22:25
I only had to fill out the application, pay the fee, and it was very quick.
22:32
It didn’t take a long time because we were in El Centro, and so, I was able to
22:39
submit my application and the fee to the immigration office there in El Centro.
22:46
So,
22:49
in terms of
22:52
your experiences as an immigrant coming to the United States, being here--you
22:59
had mentioned earlier about the language barrier when you first started college,
23:04
but were there any other experiences within your, the context of being an
23:09
immigrant that you’d like to share?
23:10
Any difficulties or challenges?
23:14
I think,
23:20
I think one of my very first unfortunate challenge was when I
23:26
was at the University of Portland.
23:29
I began the program, the Masters of Arts in Teaching in the summer of 2001.
23:36
I was in—I took five classes, and I got all A’s.
23:45
And it was so much easier for me because I had, my English was better,
23:54
and I also knew and understood all the contents in the courses that I took
24:02
because of my experience as a teacher.
24:05
I taught high school in American Samoa for about four years while we were living
24:11
there with my husband and our daughter.
24:15
And then I taught in elementary school at Catholic, at two Catholic elementary
24:22
schools in El Centro, and I also taught Mexican adults, Mexican and
24:31
Mexican-American adults at Imperial Valley College--I taught them English.
24:37
And so, all of that experience helped me to become a successful graduate student.
24:47
And so, my very first unfortunate experience was, took place at the
24:53
University of Portland where, even though I was doing very well in terms
25:01
of getting good grades in my classes, I was forced out of the program after two
25:12
semesters because I was not able to pass
25:19
the multiple subject assessment exam.
25:23
I was able to pass the multiple choice section, but I was not able
25:31
to pass the short answer section.
25:35
And, later I found I understood what was happening to me during that time.
25:42
And, when I’m under a lot of stress--and I understand this for my students
25:47
also--when a student, like myself, is under stress and pressure to
25:54
pass, it makes it very difficult.
25:57
And, I later understood my challenge was that I, and I think it’s called “test
26:08
anxiety.” And then, some of the other challenges that I had with that test was
26:15
that the material that was on the test, for instance in science, math, and social
26:23
studies were things that fifth and sixth graders were taught here in America. And
26:30
so, there was a gap in my learning; I didn’t learn the subject area when I was
26:37
in elementary school in American Samoa.
26:40
And
26:42
so, because I didn’t have the passing score for the M-A-T
26:47
program, the University of Portland
26:51
told me that I needed to leave the program until I was able to pass the second
26:59
part of the multiple subject assessment.
27:05
I still find it difficult at times to, in my work currently
27:14
as a teacher--I think sometimes,
27:19
as an immigrant here in Oregon, I have found, I’ve had experiences where
27:27
people, to me, they judge me for the way I speak, for the way I act, for
27:34
the way that I process information because sometimes it takes time for
27:40
me to process information in English.
27:44
I mean, I can understand it when something--when I hear something,
27:48
I can understand it in my native tongue, but sometimes it takes me
27:55
like a second or two to process that information in my brain and then respond.
28:03
And, I’ve found that, sometimes, when I’m quiet and listening and not
28:08
responding to, like, conversation or, or a presentation, um, I sometimes,
28:18
it’s taken, some people take it as me not having an opinion to share.
28:28
And so,
28:31
it hasn’t been easy for me all the time.
28:34
I feel misunderstood sometimes.
28:40
I feel, even with the current job, I feel that sometimes I’m at the disadvantage.
28:48
In my school right now, there are only three people of color who are
28:54
teachers—a young woman from Oakland who is Latina, the counsellor in
29:03
my school is part Native-American, part white, part African-American,
29:08
and so, and then myself, Samoa.
29:12
In some of our schools, there are no teachers of color, and we
29:16
have seven elementary schools at the Centennial School District.
29:20
And, in some of those schools, there are no people of color,
29:24
and so, it has been a struggle.
29:28
And I wish that people that I work with, like the administrators
29:32
and other teachers, I wish that they are more understanding, and,
29:40
I think, some of them
29:44
have some empathy towards me, but I think others don’t.
29:51
They don’t have empathy because—and, in fact,
29:58
the Latina teacher, and she’s my friend from Oakland, she’s fluent in Spanish.
30:06
And so, she and--she’s the only other teacher that is
30:13
fluent in Spanish in my school.
30:17
But I’m the only—I am one of two teachers who are immigrants.
30:25
My other, the other teacher is my friend Koty García, who is an immigrant from
30:33
Guadalajara, Mexico, and she teaches at another school in our school district.
30:42
In your school district, it sounds, there are very few teachers of color.
30:46
Are there are a lot of students of color?
30:48
Yes.
30:48
Oh, absolutely.
30:50
Absolutely.
30:50
In fact, in my own school, we have the highest number of students of
30:56
color and children of immigrants.
31:00
We have a large population of immigrants from the Slavic
31:06
countries--from Russia, Ukraine, um,
31:13
you know, those countries.
31:14
And then, we have a large population of African Americans in my school.
31:21
In all of our elementary school, we have African Americans, we have immigrants from
31:29
the Latin American countries, we have immigrants from Africa, from—I have
31:40
a student from Vietnam, and then I have, we have Samoan students, Tongan
31:48
students, and Micronesian students.
31:50
And so, in my school, the population of students of immigrants or of families
31:59
of immigrants from around the world and also African American students,
32:07
that population is, like, 60 or 70%.
32:14
And yet, in my building, only three teachers of color.
32:19
And, this last summer, our school district
32:27
hired very first person of color to be the assistant superintendent, Dr.
32:33
Paul Coakley is African American.
32:37
And, he’s the very first assistant superintendent and HR director.
32:43
And so, our current superintendent, who is Sam Breyer, in his three years
32:51
of tenure as a superintendent, I have seen an increase of people of
32:56
color being hired as principles and as teachers in my school district.
33:03
But again, in some of the elementary schools, there are no teachers of color.
33:09
So, the demographic of my school district has changed tremendously in
33:17
the last 20 years or so; the demographic went from predominantly white to,
33:24
now, predominantly people of color and immigrants from around the world.
33:33
Well that leads well into talking about your work with IRCO and
33:38
with the Asian Family Center.
33:41
So, can you share what your current connection is to the Asian Family Center?
33:47
Yes.
33:47
I serve as a volunteer on the advisory board for the Asian Family Center.
33:57
And, I became a board member about—I think this is the fifth
34:04
year that I’ve been a board member.
34:08
And how I became a board member was that I have been a member of
34:17
the board of directors for Samoa Pacific Development Corporation.
34:25
This non-profit was started by a group of
34:31
Samoans, both from American Samoan, from Independent Samoa.
34:35
And so, I went to IRCO because I needed to get their help
34:43
and to help me and my Samoan
34:48
Pacific Development Corporation.
34:51
And so, through that conversation with Mr. Sokhom Tauch, I believe he’s the
34:57
CEO of the IRCO organization, he advised me to go to the Family Center, the
35:06
Asian Family Center to meet Mr. Lee.
35:09
And Mr. Sokhom Tauch said that Mr. Lee
35:17
and the Asian Family Center also serve Pacific Islanders.
35:24
So, I went to the Asian Family Center, and I met Mr. Lee, and then Mr.
35:30
Lee invited me to come and join the advisory board for the Family Center.
35:38
And so, I’ve been on the board for about five years now.
35:43
So you contacted IRCO around 2009, 2010?
35:46
Yes, I think it was around 2009 when I made the connection
35:52
with the folks at IRCO.
35:55
And did you know about IRCO’s work before then?
35:58
Yes, yes I did.
36:00
I heard about them, I heard about the work that they were doing to
36:06
serve the needs of immigrants and refugees from around the world.
36:10
And I also knew that they were also serving the needs of
36:14
people from the Pacific Islands.
36:17
So I became interested in learning more about the work that they
36:23
were doing, and also I wanted to be able to, like, connect my own
36:32
organization for Pacific Islanders with
36:38
IRCO because IRCO has been helping in this area, I believe,
36:43
for the last 30-some years.
36:45
And so, so I tapped IRCO as a way to network with my
36:53
organization for Pacific Islanders.
36:57
So I’m curious, when you first moved here to Oregon, did you
37:04
know about IRCO at that time?
37:06
Did you look for any organizations that provided services to immigrants,
37:10
or that you didn’t need those services, or you didn’t know about
37:13
them, in terms of your role as…?
37:16
Oh when I moved in here from California?
37:21
Actually, when you first moved here.
37:24
When you were really young, did you reach out to any organizations
37:27
at that time, or did you just have support from the universities that
37:31
you attended, and that was enough?
37:33
Uh yes.
37:34
So when I came from, when I came from, when I came in 1978, I was a student in
37:43
La Grande at Eastern Oregon State College.
37:46
Um, I, the—I didn’t go out of the university because I had all of what
37:56
I needed--you know, the professors, and the Eastern Oregon University
38:04
had a program for foreign students.
38:07
So, we had an advisor that also helped us with, you know, whatever
38:11
needs that we might have at the time.
38:14
And then again when I went down to the University of Oregon I was a student and
38:20
so my, so there was no need for me to be looking for assistance outside of campus.
38:29
And also, what I didn’t share with you was that I came on a scholarship,
38:36
a full-ride scholarship from the government of American Samoa.
38:42
And, that scholarship paid for my room and board, and my parents
38:49
didn’t have to pay for anything.
38:52
And so, my tuition, room and board was covered with my scholarship.
38:59
And so, but--currently, I know that IRCO Family Center is serving
39:05
the needs of people from the Pacific—Samoan people, Tongan people,
39:11
folks from the Micronesian Islands.
39:15
I know that IRCO
39:18
is providing services not only to students, but also to adults.
39:27
So, what do you see as your role, excuse me, as the board’s role within the
39:34
Asian Family Center and within IRCO?
39:36
So, as a whole, what do you foresee for the board in terms of what you’ve been
39:41
doing for the past five years and what you hope for them to continue to do?
39:45
Well, one of the--I think one of the two things that I see about
39:50
myself as a member of the board.
39:53
First, we’re an advisory board; we
39:58
advise and we give our ideas to Mr. Lee, who is the CEO of the Family Center.
40:06
We meet quarterly, and so there are
40:12
matters that Mr. Lee asks the board for input.
40:17
And
40:20
also, when we have fundraisers, the board members help by soliciting funds.
40:28
And also, we had a bake fundraiser about two years ago, and we were able to raise
40:37
a large amount of money because the board members not only solicited donations
40:43
from businesses in the community, but we also helped sell tickets.
40:50
And the tickets were $100 per person, and I was able to sell
40:57
tickets for the fundraiser.
41:00
And so, those are the two things that I know of that the board, the advisory
41:07
board in which I serve, help with the,
41:13
you know, Mr. Lee and the folks at the Family Center, the Asian Family Center.
41:21
So do you see yourself as a liaison between the organization
41:27
and community members?
41:28
Uh, yes.
41:29
Yes.
41:30
I, you know, I’m very busy as a school teacher, but I see myself as
41:37
a liaison, yes correct, between IRCO and the community, and especially
41:45
the Pacific Islander community.
41:48
I let my community know that there are resources through
41:53
IRCO for students because IRCO
42:01
runs the SUN Program in some of the schools in Portland.
42:06
And so, students are getting the benefit of after school program through SUN.
42:13
And I also know that IRCO has—IRCO and the Asian Family Center—have
42:22
hired Pacific Islanders.
42:25
And I also know that they have also helped provide assistance to adults,
42:32
and I know that they, that some of the IRCO employees visit people at home
42:44
and provide services for those folks.
42:46
And I’ve heard that they’ve gone to homes of Pacific Islanders, and um, to provide
42:54
services for, you know, little, small children, adults, and students alike.
43:02
Wonderful.
43:03
So you’ve mentioned a variety of services that the Asian Family Center provides.
43:10
What do you see as some of the most important services that the Asian
43:16
Family Center provides within the immigrant and refugee community?
43:20
You’ve mentioned working with small children, you’ve mentioned some of
43:23
the adult programs and employment opportunities, so can you share a little
43:28
bit about that in terms of what you’ve done with the board, and, you know, ideas
43:33
that you’ve come up with, programs that you’ve developed, or ideas that you have
43:38
to, for them to work with the community?
43:40
Yes.
43:41
Well, IRCO has full time staff that work with adults and
43:49
families and also with students.
43:53
And so, my role as a board member is to advise the Mr. Lee and his staff.
44:01
So, we’re, I have not had to be the organizer of, you know, what goes on
44:07
with the programs because they have staff members that take care of those things.
44:13
And so, my role is to advise Mr. Lee in areas that they need our expert advice.
44:24
And also, I have helped with fundraisers.
44:28
But I do know from going to the meetings and hearing Mr. Lee presentation and
44:35
also the staff presentations of all of the work that goes behind the scene.
44:40
And so, and so, I envision that they will continue to do these, I mean,
44:49
provide these services for our immigrants and refugees from around the world.
44:55
So are there any examples that you’d like to share that you can think of
44:59
where members within your community have said that they needed certain
45:05
services or would like certain services, and you’ve taken that to the board
45:09
and then Mr. Lee has applied them?
45:12
Can you talk a little bit about that process?
45:13
And you can think of anything from, you know, community need to the board to
45:18
then actually applying that in the AFC.
45:21
Yes.
45:21
Um, so as a board member for Pacific, for Samoa Pacific Development Corporation,
45:30
I have advised the ministers because they’re the ones that, that, I
45:38
mean—the Pacific Island community,
45:45
especially those that go to the Pacific Island churches, um, my role between
45:54
the IRCO and my Pacific Island is for me to provide the information to the
45:59
ministers, and that information is then shared with parishioners—that
46:05
there are services at IRCO that will benefit the population, especially the
46:12
population from the Pacific Islands.
46:13
And so, I get the word out to our Pacific Island
46:22
community to take advantage of the services through IRCO.
46:29
But I also know from talking to the staff at IRCO that they do go out to
46:35
the families of Pacific Islanders, and they also go to the schools -–to
46:41
elementary school, middle school, and high school—and provide assistance
46:48
to students of Pacific Island, you know, from Pacific Island families.
46:54
And so, that has been--those are some of the examples of how I have connected
47:01
IRCO with my Pacific Island community.
47:05
Wonderful.
47:07
So what do you see as your personal and professional role within the
47:15
immigrant and refugee communities?
47:16
So you’ve mentioned that you act as a liaison, you make connections,
47:21
your experiences as an immigrant yourself, and how that has shaped you.
47:28
So is there both the personal and professional connection to why
47:31
you are an advisory board member?
47:34
Yes, absolutely.
47:37
You know, so as a teacher,
47:41
especially as teacher in a school or a school district where there is a large
47:48
population of immigrants and refugees.
47:51
Um,
47:55
so professionally, I
48:01
have learned that there’s so much that I can provide to not only my students
48:09
in term of academic preparation for high school, for middle school, high school,
48:14
and college, I also provide information to the parents regarding services
48:22
that are available in the community.
48:25
And I have also advised the parents about services that IRCO provides.
48:31
And then, when I have, you know--during conferences when parents come, especially
48:40
parents of, immigrants’ parents,
48:46
I not only talk about their children’s academic progress, I
48:51
also share with them during that time, services that IRCO provides.
48:57
And IRCO also provides
49:02
interpreters for us, and I have met several interpreters that
49:12
are from IRCO during conferences.
49:17
So, what are some of the biggest needs within the Pacific Islander community?
49:25
Is it, you know, needs for the children, for adults, language
49:29
barrier, employment opportunities?
49:33
What do you see as some of the needs within the community?
49:35
Yes.
49:38
What I have learned in my 16 years here and my eighth, this is my
49:46
eighth year working for Centennial School District--prior to working,
49:52
becoming a teacher in public school, I was a Catholic school teacher
49:56
for the Archdiocese of Portland.
49:57
And
50:00
so, I have learned that
50:04
students
50:07
of Pacific Islanders who came to America as adults and also
50:17
children of Pacific Islanders
50:21
who are not fluent in English,
50:25
those children have the hardest time in school because, although they’re
50:31
learning English in school, the language spoken at home is still Samoan.
50:40
And so, I know that some of our Pacific Island students struggle.
50:46
They struggle in school because of language barrier.
50:49
They also struggle in school when the teachers don’t understand
50:53
what it’s like to come to school.
50:56
And,
51:00
some teachers, not all teachers, but some teachers do not realize how difficult
51:06
it is for some of these students to come to school where the language is
51:12
English and then go home where the language is their mother language of
51:19
people from Samoa, Tonga, and other islands in the Pacific.
51:25
And one of the biggest problems that I see for some of these students is that
51:32
sometimes they have homework, and they have homework where there’s no adults at
51:39
home that can understand the homework.
51:42
So these students have nobody at home that can help them because the parents
51:50
don’t have the background knowledge and the parents are not fluent in English.
51:57
And so, those students will always be at the disadvantage.
52:01
And,
52:03
I have seen that.
52:05
I have seen students drop out from middle school and high school because they get
52:12
so frustrated with, again, with the lack of knowledge or lack of understanding
52:20
of the subject matters, and they get frustrated because of the lack of support
52:29
from people and from the faculty or from folks in middle and high school.
52:35
And some of my own students or students that I know of, Samoan
52:40
students and Tongan students, drop out middle school and high school.
52:49
And, so that’s sad.
52:50
It’s very sad for me when I know, you know, when I come across a
52:55
family and they tell me their story.
52:58
And then I hear the child’s story, you know, something happens at school, there
53:03
was a misunderstanding, and then they were expelled or the student just gave up.
53:14
So for those students, that’s part of the reason why the SUN program exists.
53:18
Is that—are there SUN schools within your school district?
53:22
Yes.
53:22
Yes.
53:22
In fact, there’s a SUN, there’s SUN school in my school at Harold Oliver Elementary.
53:29
I believe there are—so we have seven elementary schools in Centennial, and,
53:37
I believe, there are probably three or four SUN programs, three or four
53:44
or five schools have the SUN program.
53:49
So then, you definitely, I would assume, you encourage your students who need that
53:53
extra support to attend the SUN school.
53:55
Oh absolutely, yes.
53:56
And so, my—three years ago was my first year at Oliver Elementary.
54:06
I volunteered to be the chess coach because they wanted a certified
54:15
staff, a teacher to be the
54:20
chess coach—Chess for Success.
54:23
And so, I did that for a couple of months, but it was difficult because I
54:28
was brand new at Oliver Elementary, and I was trying to, you know, take care
54:34
of not only my responsibility as the fifth grade teacher, but I was trying
54:40
to juggle the afterschool program.
54:43
So, I helped out for about a month, and then I just told the SUN coordinator
54:49
that it was, it was too difficult, too much, the obligation to my
54:57
teaching job was, just, overwhelming, becoming very overwhelming.
55:03
But yes, I always encourage my students, especially the ones that could benefit
55:12
from, you know, the SUN teachers helping them with homework, and also the students
55:20
learning, I mean, doing activities that they normally don’t do when they go home.
55:27
Like, you know, they have sports, they have sports, they have chess, they have
55:33
cooking classes, they have, I mean all the programs that students don’t get from
55:42
the teachers or from the school, those programs they get from the SUN program.
55:49
And plus, the SUN staff also help our students with their homework because
55:56
some of our students have parents that don’t speak English or parents that,
56:01
yeah, that don’t speak English and can’t help them with their homework.
56:04
So the SUN program, through IRCO and through the other SUN, help
56:10
our immigrant students to become successful in their subjects.
56:17
And that’s at your elementary school, so when they go to middle school and
56:20
high school do they continue getting assistance or, at that point, they
56:27
don’t have the SUN program anymore?
56:28
SUN program only exist, I believe, in elementary.
56:33
And so, I don’t know what extra support, like, after school support
56:40
that the students get when they’re in middle school and high school.
56:46
I’m not, I don’t know.
56:50
But you find that the SUN program, especially at that early age, is
56:54
very helpful to help build all their skills and the basics, and then it
56:58
prepares them for middle school?
57:01
Well, the SUN program after school, I mean, the teachers take care of all
57:12
the basics in the academics, but the SUN program also provides the support
57:20
that the students need for example, for instance, in their homework.
57:25
You know, if a child has homework, they are able to complete the homework with
57:32
the assistance from the SUN teachers.
57:36
And so, they get that help, they are provided that help that they
57:43
may not get when they get home.
57:46
And, but, in addition to the help for homework, they also are
57:55
able to take other courses, such as cooking and arts and crafts,
58:05
music.
58:05
I believe, in some of the SUN programs they have music, they have dance
58:10
teachers that come after school, and then they have sports—they have
58:14
basketball and I believe soccer.
58:17
And so, some of the—so like, for instance, the basketball and soccer, there are
58:25
after school programs in the community where children, parents pay for their
58:33
children to play football, soccer, or basketball, but the children get
58:41
that from SUN, you know, from, so they learn the skills, you know, to become
58:50
a soccer player or a basketball player.
58:53
So they learn those skills from the coaches.
58:57
But in terms of skills, I don’t think they learn--the SUN teachers
59:03
are not certified teachers,
59:09
so they don’t teach skills, you know, like in math, writing, and,
59:15
but they get help in providing help for the homework to the students.
59:24
And the SUN program, are there events that incorporate the parents
59:28
and the families, and does that happen sometimes, incorporating the
59:34
parents into that learning process or that support, or not so much?
59:39
No, not so much.
59:40
It’s more just support for the students.
59:42
Yes, yes, support for the students.
59:44
But I also know that
59:48
IRCO provides supports to parents.
59:53
And I believe, IRCO also provides, like, English, English classes.
1:00:00
IRCO also help adults who are, who are studying to become U.S. citizens, yes.
1:00:10
They help them, you know, with the test materials.
1:00:17
So there are classes for adults who are studying the history and who are preparing
1:00:24
to take the test to become U.S. citizens.
1:00:30
And, one of the things that I hope I can do is to visit the SUN school, you
1:00:37
know, the SUN program that IRCO runs.
1:00:41
I know that there’s some SUN—IRCO has a SUN program in Portland Public
1:00:49
and, I believe, David Douglass,
1:00:55
but not at Centennial, IRCO doesn’t run those SUN programs.
1:01:01
So, it’s Portland Public, Southeast Portland, Southeast area
1:01:05
schools—I think three, four, or five in Portland public schools.
1:01:13
Wonderful.
1:01:15
And, can you talk a little bit about your role within the other organization
1:01:23
that you mentioned and how you became involved with that organization?
1:01:30
And you’re an advisory board member for the Samoa
1:01:35
Pacific Development Corporation, is that correct?
1:01:38
Yes.
1:01:38
So, you’re role with that organization.
1:01:40
I know you’ve mentioned it a little bit, but how that got started,
1:01:43
a little bit about that history.
1:01:45
Oh, okay.
1:01:46
So, Samoa, Samoa Dev.—uh, excuse me—Samoa Pacific Development
1:01:53
Corporation was started in
1:01:58
2002 by a group of Samoan people.
1:02:01
And, one of the main organizer, in fact, he is the person who started
1:02:09
it is a relative of mine, but, and his name is Dr. Toeutu Fa’aleava.
1:02:18
He is the director of the McNair Scholars program at Portland State University.
1:02:26
And so, he was the one that started the organization when he and his
1:02:33
family moved to Portland from, I believe, from San Francisco.
1:02:38
And while he was studying to become a lawyer, while he was in law school
1:02:44
and the PhD program at UC Berkley, he also helped with the Samoan
1:02:53
community nonprofit organization down there.
1:02:57
And so, when he moved, when he got the job as the McNair Scholars director at
1:03:06
PSU, he and some of our Samoan people decided to start the nonprofit.
1:03:14
And so, it was started in 2002, and I joined the board in 2000… I think 2005.
1:03:24
And
1:03:27
so, I’m currently, I’m serving as the secretary for the board of directors.
1:03:35
And,
1:03:40
in the past I was president, I was president of the organization
1:03:46
for, I think, two, three years.
1:03:50
And, I was a vice-president, and I was also the treasurer.
1:03:57
So, I’ve held president, vice-president, treasurer, and
1:04:00
now I’m the current secretary.
1:04:03
And so, I have—one of the things that I’ve, I’ve done with my, with
1:04:11
IRCO is to try to merge, I mean not merge, but network with IRCO
1:04:22
for services that would benefit our Pacific Island community.
1:04:27
And so,
1:04:31
our Pacific Island nonprofit is still developing.
1:04:35
We have
1:04:38
nine board members, and every year we select, you know, the president, vice
1:04:46
president, secretary, and treasurer.
1:04:51
And so, it’s still in very--how do you say--beginning stage.
1:05:00
And
1:05:02
so, I think we’re in the,
1:05:07
we’re moving towards—one of the things that we, we
1:05:15
are working on is to be able to write grants, get grants from private
1:05:24
and also from the governments--the federal, state, and local government.
1:05:31
And so, we’re in that process writing grants.
1:05:36
Right now, as we speak, we have a bank account, and I think we have less than
1:05:43
2,000 dollars in our bank account.
1:05:46
And so, we’re, we’re very, I mean, at the very beginning
1:05:50
stage of building our nonprofit.
1:05:54
And so, our main goal is to be able to write some grants, and then be
1:06:01
able to provide services similar to IRCO, that’s our plan, is to be able
1:06:08
to provide services to our students.
1:06:10
So our organization is targeting--we want to target children from K
1:06:18
through 12, that’s our main goal.
1:06:22
And so, if we can get grants to provide after school programs,
1:06:31
that would be wonderful.
1:06:32
And also, the other goal that we have is to be able to provide services
1:06:39
to our young people and adults, similar to what IRCO is doing.
1:06:45
So, IRCO, for me, is a very good.
1:06:50
IRCO will provide the resources for our, for my Pacific Island community nonprofit.
1:06:59
And so, that is the reason, one of the reasons, why I became involved
1:07:05
with IRCO because I wanted to learn from what folks are doing for IRCO.
1:07:11
And I was told that, you know, they started it--you know, just a small
1:07:19
group of people was how IRCO started, and now they’re very successful.
1:07:28
It’s going on—IRCO has been in existence for over 30 years now.
1:07:35
And so, I envision taking my Samoa Pacific—I envision in 20 years from now,
1:07:47
we will be close to where IRCO is now.
1:07:51
So that’s our goal, is to be able to find grants that will enable us to
1:07:59
provide services similar to what IRCO is currently providing to families
1:08:10
and to adults, students and adults.
1:08:14
And that service is within the Portland area?
1:08:17
Uh, within Multnomah County and we have a large population of Islanders
1:08:25
in Washington County and also across the river in Clark County, yeah.
1:08:32
And so, that’s our big picture, is to eventually have a building with—and that
1:08:47
we would be able to hire our Pacific Islanders, adults, and young adults,
1:08:54
and adults to run these programs.
1:08:57
And so, that’s where I would be able to use my background as an educator
1:09:05
to help students with their, you know, whatever need that they have,
1:09:12
whether it’s academics, computer, you know, literacy for adults,
1:09:22
classes, you know, for adults, and
1:09:28
help our adults from the Pacific Islands study to get their
1:09:34
citizenship, their U.S. citizenship, and just to be able to provide
1:09:40
employment to our adults in addition.
1:09:45
But our main goal is to have programs and have resources to help our students
1:09:53
from K through 12 and also have some resource, some funding to help our
1:10:02
college students with their tuition.
1:10:04
So do you foresee using the same model as IRCO but specific to the
1:10:11
Samoan Pacific Islander community?
1:10:12
Yes.
1:10:12
Yes, yes, exactly.
1:10:14
Wonderful.
1:10:15
And do you foresee yourself remaining on the board as long as you can continuing…?
1:10:20
Yes, for IRCO?
1:10:20
Yes.
1:10:21
For IRCO and for the Samoa, for both?
1:10:23
Samoa, yes.
1:10:24
Yes, I do.
1:10:25
I do because, you know it’s, we meet quarterly, so it’s not, you know,
1:10:32
demanding, and it’s a great way for me to connect with my friends at
1:10:39
IRCO and to stay in touch with my Pacific Island brothers and sisters.
1:10:45
And, over your many years serving the community, have you seen the needs
1:10:51
change over time, or do you find that as people move to the United
1:10:55
States, that it’s the same needs, it’s just more people are coming?
1:11:01
Anything to share about that, your thoughts on the needs, what the
1:11:06
needs are and how’ve they’ve changed?
1:11:06
Yes.
1:11:06
I think the needs of the people,
1:11:11
it’s the same, you know.
1:11:13
Immigrants--from immigrants, especially young adults and adults
1:11:23
who are not fluent in English,
1:11:27
they struggle to get employment.
1:11:31
And, students who come to the United States from other
1:11:36
countries struggle with language.
1:11:40
And if you can just imagine, let’s say a 15 year old, okay,
1:11:45
from Burma or from Africa.
1:11:51
Fifteen year olds here in America are in high school, and a fifteen year old that
1:11:58
comes from foreign countries, they’re put in high school, and they’re expected
1:12:05
to be able to learn the same materials that Americans fifteen, I mean fifteen
1:12:11
year olds that grew up in America.
1:12:14
And so, those students, I have learned from my friends at IRCO, many of
1:12:19
those students drop out because, you know, you can’t take the students
1:12:25
from a foreign country, put them in high school, and expect them to
1:12:31
learn English, you know, overnight.
1:12:34
And so, so I know of students and I’ve heard stories of high, you know
1:12:43
high, especially middle school and high school students who drop out.
1:12:48
And,
1:12:53
what was the other question?
1:12:55
Well, I think you answered it in terms of the needs are similar as immigrants come.
1:13:00
It’s one of the main needs, especially for young adults, is the language
1:13:03
barrier, which you yourself faced personally when you moved here.
1:13:07
You knew a little bit of English, but it was in college that then you really
1:13:12
learned more English, is that correct?
1:13:13
Yes, I learned more English, and I became fluent while as a college student.
1:13:20
And, one of the advantages that I had was that because there were no other
1:13:25
Samoan students, either at Eastern Oregon State College in Le Grande or
1:13:31
at the University of Oregon, I was able to speak English all the time.
1:13:38
And that was an advantage for me.
1:13:42
One of the struggles that I know of, that I’m aware of is the struggle
1:13:50
for families, especially families either Pacific Island families or immigrants
1:13:59
and refugees from other parts of the world, so when they come to America,
1:14:04
their children start going to school.
1:14:07
And their children start learning from their friends or from being in American
1:14:13
school, the culture--the culture outside of these families’ culture.
1:14:19
And
1:14:22
one of the things that I have learned is that the culture of the parents
1:14:27
and the culture here in the United States, those two cultures clash.
1:14:33
And so, new things or things that immigrant students learn sometimes
1:14:43
clash with the culture of their home environment, and that causes a
1:14:49
lot of hardship, I believe, for not only, especially teenagers, young
1:14:57
adults, and their immigrant parents.
1:15:01
And so, I have learned that through my own work as a teacher and also through
1:15:07
my work as a community leader because it happens with our Pacific Island
1:15:13
community, and I also know through my own work as a teacher, it happens in
1:15:20
our immigrant and refugee community.
1:15:26
So the clash of two cultures creates a lot of conflict and hardship in our
1:15:33
immigrants and refugee family household.
1:15:38
So, in your experience, do you find that the, the adults that move here
1:15:43
want to retain that culture and keep the connection back home, whereas
1:15:49
the young adults, perhaps, want to, want to assimilate a little more to
1:15:56
the culture of the United States?
1:15:56
Yes, yes.
1:15:57
Yes, yes, yes.
1:15:58
I have seen that.
1:15:59
And I have heard of the—and it happens when the children are, are in middle
1:16:07
school and especially in high school and beyond high school when children
1:16:12
of immigrants want to be, like, “Americans”--have all the, you know,
1:16:19
the things that young adults or young
1:16:24
high school and middle school students want to be just like their American
1:16:29
friends or just like… You know, ‘cuz we have students who parents
1:16:37
are immigrants but they themselves were born here in the United States.
1:16:44
So I have, I know of conflicts between the parents, parents who are immigrants
1:16:53
and their children because parents who are immigrants, they want to keep
1:16:57
their culture, and, but then their children are learning the so-called
1:17:04
“American culture.” And I know that sometimes it causes conflict. Not all
1:17:13
the families, but I know of families where the two were, I mean, like you
1:17:21
said, the children want to assimilate whereas the parents are trying to keep
1:17:27
them, you know, away from the American culture. And, we’re all Americans.
1:17:36
And, with you, personally, was it as important to you to retain your
1:17:42
first language, your native tongue?
1:17:43
Yes.
1:17:43
And, do you still speak it?
1:17:45
Yes.
1:17:45
Did your children learn it?
1:17:46
Um.
1:17:47
My daughter, uh, spoke the language.
1:17:51
She was fluent in both Samoan and English when she was growing up in Samoa, but
1:17:58
when we moved to southern California, I became a teacher, and I had to work on
1:18:05
my English because when I was back in Samoa, I used both English and Samoan.
1:18:13
I explain, like, when I would be teaching history or government
1:18:18
or even English, I would explain things in Samoan to my Samoan
1:18:23
students ‘cuz they were all Samoans.
1:18:26
And, when I was teaching history or U.S. government, I found myself explaining
1:18:32
some of the concepts in Samoan to my students who were not fluent in English.
1:18:41
But when we moved to southern California,
1:18:47
I spoke English both at home and at school, and I had to work on my English
1:18:55
because I had a heavy accent when I moved back to the United States.
1:19:01
And so, if my children were growing up in Samoa, they would be fluent in both.
1:19:09
They would be bilingual.
1:19:14
Unfortunately, they—my son doesn’t speak.
1:19:18
He understands a little bit, but my daughter—even though Niva doesn’t
1:19:26
speak Samoan, but she understands, she has retained the knowledge.
1:19:33
And, I’m sure, once she moves to Samoa--because she’s planning to get
1:19:40
a job and go work there as a lawyer and spend time with grandma--I’m
1:19:46
sure once she is emerged into the culture, I’m sure it will come back.
1:19:52
But I speak Samoan, Samoan is my native tongue.
1:19:58
So, when I call my mom on the phone, of course I speak Samoan to her.
1:20:02
She’s not, she doesn’t speak English.
1:20:05
She understands more than she can speak.
1:20:08
Do you feel that, um, it’s a problem in the United States that the
1:20:14
culture of this country isn’t as supportive of bilingualism and it
1:20:21
tends to be more English-centric?
1:20:24
Do you find that that’s a problem or not so much?
1:20:27
Um, I think
1:20:34
people are more accepting of students to speak their mother tongue now
1:20:41
than, maybe like, 40 years ago, okay.
1:20:45
40 years ago, the idea was to assimilate students, but I think now, the
1:20:54
culture that we have now in the schools is to, for students to
1:21:01
learn English but also for students to retain their native language.
1:21:08
Because, you know, studies shows, but also my own experience as a
1:21:15
profession, if a child, let’s say the child is from Samoa, if the child is
1:21:21
fluent, can read and write and speak in Samoan, that child will have a more
1:21:29
successful experience learning English.
1:21:33
So, if a child is fluent in writing, speaking, and reading in
1:21:39
their mother tongue, they are more successful in learning English.
1:21:46
And so, we don’t discourage children from speaking their mother tongue, and
1:21:53
we don’t, and we—myself and I know many of the teachers—we encourage the parents
1:22:03
to speak their native tongue at home.
1:22:07
So I think, I think now we’re, we’re more accepting, I think, of your
1:22:17
immigrant children or children of immigrants using their native tongue.
1:22:23
And, of course, I encourage my students in my class to teach each other.
1:22:29
So if, like, a child doesn’t, only speaks English, I encourage those
1:22:35
children to learn either Spanish or Russian or Vietnamese from their
1:22:41
friends but, especially español,
1:22:44
because I tell my students, 20, 30 years from now,
1:22:51
people who speak Spanish will outnumber people who speak only English.
1:22:59
That I’ve heard from studies, right.
1:23:02
That’s the prediction, like, 30 years from now.
1:23:05
And so, I have encouraged my non-Spanish speaking students to learn Spanish from
1:23:13
their friends and to take Spanish when they go to middle school and high school.
1:23:20
And, a couple, just, closing questions at this point.
1:23:24
You retained your connection to American Samoa because your parents
1:23:29
lived there and your mother still lives there and you return periodically.
1:23:34
Do you find that immigrants that have been coming in the last 10 or so years and
1:23:40
continue to come to the United States, do they retain the same connection as well?
1:23:45
Is that common?
1:23:46
Yes.
1:23:47
Yes, and I know that from,
1:23:51
from my own students.
1:23:52
Like, last year, some of my students went to Mexico, and it was either their
1:24:00
first time to Mexico or it’s like their second trip to Mexico, my sixth grade.
1:24:05
I had two sixth grade students who made a trip to Mexico with their parents.
1:24:13
And then, I had one student who went to Ukraine with her mother, and
1:24:19
she was away for about three weeks.
1:24:23
And then, another student’s parents went to Ukraine right before all
1:24:29
the trouble, uh, you know, with the Russian and the Ukrainian, you
1:24:38
know, the problem in Ukraine.
1:24:41
And then, I had my Vietnamese students have back with their parents to Vietnam.
1:24:48
And so—and then, of course, I go to visit my family.
1:24:53
And, I think, because nowadays immigrants are able to work and they’re able to
1:25:02
save up their money to take--either the parents go back home to visit their
1:25:10
parents, the parents of my students, and my own students have made the
1:25:15
trip back to their native country to visit grandparents and family.
1:25:25
And so, it’s, I think it’s probably more common now for our immigrants to return
1:25:33
for visits than it was 30 or 40 years ago.
1:25:39
So, in terms of recommendations that you have for the Asian Family Center,
1:25:46
do you have any in particular or is it mostly to continue doing what they’re
1:25:50
doing, anything that you can add to that?
1:25:55
No, I don’t think there’s—I think what IRCO is doing right now, especially the
1:26:03
Asian Family Center, I think they’re doing everything that—the services that
1:26:10
we’re providing through Family Center is
1:26:15
meeting the needs of our immigrants and refugees from around the world.
1:26:20
And, I haven’t seen my friends for about a year now, I’ve been very
1:26:27
busy with my work as a teacher.
1:26:31
And we have a board meeting, I think at the last week of the month, and this,
1:26:42
actually tomorrow, we’re meeting with a group of immigrants and one
1:26:49
of our board members, Polo-- and I think you’re gonna interview Polo
1:26:55
or I’m gonna send Polo an email.
1:26:57
So, Polo works for the city of Portland, and he and his colleagues
1:27:03
are going to meet with the, me and some of the immigrants tomorrow.
1:27:08
And they’re going to train us to fill out the grant application for our community
1:27:16
to apply for grants from the city, and that will help us with, you know,
1:27:23
you’ve heard of the community gardens?
1:27:27
And so, I’m going to write to, fill out an application for my Pacific
1:27:35
Island community to be able to get funding from the city of Portland to
1:27:40
start a community garden where we can grow food in the spring and summer.
1:27:49
Um, so that meeting is tomorrow, and I know my immigrant friends
1:27:57
will be attending the meeting.
1:27:59
And, Polo who is one of the members of the advisory board is, and his
1:28:05
friends from the city of Portland, are going to train us as to how
1:28:10
to fill out the grant application.
1:28:14
Wonderful.
1:28:16
So, is there anything that we have not discussed that you would like
1:28:21
to share--anything personal or professional or anything that you’d
1:28:25
like to return and expand upon?
1:28:28
You know, I think one thing that I want to share is what I have learned to do.
1:28:39
Some of my friends, especially my Samoan and Tongan friends,
1:28:47
these are people that I know,
1:28:51
they have not learned to--like me, they have not learned to become involved in
1:29:02
organizations other than church community.
1:29:07
And so, some of my friends who are my age, I am 55 now, their connection is,
1:29:17
it’s very, in a very—like my Samoan friends, you know, they go to church
1:29:23
and that’s really their, like, their
1:29:29
life, okay.
1:29:30
And, what I wish that more people would do, like people from the Pacific
1:29:36
Islands, is to be able to connect, network with other folks--like, network
1:29:44
with IRCO or network with the Latin American organizations and to get,
1:29:52
and to learn about assistance and programs that are available out there.
1:29:58
And so, I have learned through IRCO that there are a lot of resources,
1:30:04
I mean, there are—if you know how to write the grant--in which I
1:30:07
don’t know, I wish I know--but if you know how to write a grant for,
1:30:16
for your community, you can get the money, right.
1:30:20
And so, that’s what I have learned from IRCO, that they have people that is their
1:30:27
job, their only job is to write grants.
1:30:29
And my hope is, my organization, the Pacific Island peoples’ organization
1:30:37
will be able to hire somebody to write grants for our nonprofit.
1:30:45
And I also, one of the things that I want to be able to do is to encourage
1:30:51
people from my Pacific Island community to make friends with people outside of
1:31:00
our, their own small church community.
1:31:03
And I think that through my own work as a teacher and through my
1:31:08
connection with IRCO, I have learned that there are, that there a lot
1:31:13
of resources available for everyone and anyone if they know where to go.
1:31:25
Well, any closing thoughts that you’d like to share at this point?
1:31:30
Thank you.
1:31:31
Thank you, Natalia for doing this because, you know, this is very important.
1:31:38
It’s important for other people and for people in the community to know the
1:31:44
work that IRCO is doing through Asian Family Center, and it’s also important
1:31:49
for people in the community to know that it’s not easy for immigrants
1:31:55
and refugees to come to America.
1:31:59
And, without programs like IRCO, I can just imagine how lost.
1:32:08
I can remember stories of my own, of, you know, my own family--people that left
1:32:17
Samoa for Hawaii and also for the mainland--how difficult it
1:32:22
was for them, and they found help through their churches.
1:32:28
And, I think one of the things that I would like to be able to do is to be able
1:32:34
to visit the churches--the Samoan, the Tongans, and Micronesian churches--and
1:32:40
bring to them the resources, you know, list the resources that are available,
1:32:47
including IRCO and the Asian Family Center and also resources that, and resources
1:32:54
and people that they can contact for any assistance that they might need.
1:33:03
So, I, again, I’d like to thank you for your work and for driving all the
1:33:07
way from Corvallis to interview me.
1:33:11
So, it’s a privilege and an honor to be interviewed, thank you.
1:33:15
Well, thank you so much for sharing your story, it was wonderful to hear.
1:33:19
Thank you.
1:33:20
And, in Samoan, like Marcus Mariota said when he received his
1:33:28
Heisman trophy, at the end of his acceptance speech, he said,
1:33:32
“Fa’afetai tele lava,” which means “thank you very much.”
