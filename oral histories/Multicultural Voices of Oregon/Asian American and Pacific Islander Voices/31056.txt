00:07
My name is Natalia Fernández; I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian
00:12
for OSU’s Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:15
Today’s date is October 7th, 2014, and we are at the Asian Family Center
00:21
to conduct an oral history interview.
00:23
So, if we could get started by stating your name and spelling it out loud.
00:28
My name is Lyn Tan.
00:30
L-Y-N, T-A-N.
00:33
And, what is your birthdate and your birthplace?
00:36
Birthdate is October 1st, 1964, and I was born in Singapore.
00:42
And what cultural or ethnic backgrounds do you identify yourself with?
00:48
I am from Singapore, so I identify myself as Singaporean, that’s one.
00:54
So, you know, in terms of nationality, I’m Singaporean.
00:57
This is despite living here for almost three decades, but, yeah,
01:03
I still see myself as Singaporean.
01:06
In terms of ethnic culture, I am Peranakan.
01:10
So, Peranakan is a distinct cultural group that you find in Singapore,
01:20
some parts of Malaysia, and Indonesia.
01:22
And so, that’s one main cultural group that I identify with.
01:27
In Singapore, Peranakans have been integrated very
01:31
well into the more-mainstream and larger Chinese culture.
01:36
And, Peranakans have been seen as almost a subgroup of Chinese
01:39
Culture, so I am comfortable in Chinese-based cultures also.
01:46
And, when and where were your parents born?
01:50
Both my parents were born in Singapore.
01:53
My mom is deceased; she’s been deceased eight years—the exact dates, you know, the
01:59
year escapes me, but she was 65 when she passed, and it’s been eight years since.
02:05
So I guess we can do the math there.
02:08
And my dad will be 83 in a week or so, you know, and he was also born in Singapore.
02:17
And so, is that where you grew up, in Singapore?
02:19
Mm-hm.
02:20
And, for how long were you there and when did you come over to the United States, or
02:24
did you live elsewhere before coming here?
02:27
So, I was born and I grew up in Singapore and had done my primary and
02:34
secondary education in Singapore and
02:40
came when I was 19.
02:42
So, when I came, it was specifically to go to the U of O
02:46
for college, this was at the end of
02:51
1983 - yeah.
02:53
And, I’ve pretty much been in the U.S. ever since, save for maybe about almost
03:01
two years after I graduated from the U of O—had gone back for close to two years and
03:11
then came back again, this was 1991 when I came back and have been here ever since.
03:18
So what made you choose the U of O, and what made you choose Oregon?
03:24
It wasn’t my first choice—Oregon wasn’t my first choice.
03:29
I had applied to several places.
03:33
So, I had applied to NYU and Columbia, UCLA, USC,
03:40
and were accepted into all of them, but—in addition to the U of O—but,
03:47
for my parents, I think at that time, the thought of my running wild in New
03:53
York—I wanted to go to New York to go to a big city—the thought of my
03:59
running wild in New York, my parents were not very comfortable with that.
04:04
Neither were they very comfortable with me being in L.A.—same reason for me to want
04:09
to go to L.A., it’s like, “oh, okay it’s a big, fun city, many things to do.” And
04:16
so, the reason why I had initially even applied for Oregon was I just figured that
04:22
that would be an easy sell for my parents.
04:28
I had a cousin who was attending college at Lewis and Clark at that time.
04:33
My brother had started college a semester, a quarter before me, so he was
04:42
going to school in Salem at Willamette.
04:44
So for me, it’s like, “look it, mom and dad, I have a cousin in Lewis and Clark,
04:50
I’ve got a brother in Salem, so how could this go wrong?” You know, yeah.
04:59
And that’s how I ended up at the U of O. At that time, there were also quite
05:06
a number of Singaporean students who were attending school at the U of O.
05:12
So it’s something that gave my parents comfort to know that I was away, but
05:20
there were relatives close by and also a small Singaporean community.
05:27
So, they knew—my parents were acquainted with some of these students because
05:35
they knew the parents, you know, who had their kids at the U of O, so yeah.
05:40
Is there a reason, or a few reasons, in particular why the Singaporean
05:44
community was in that Eugene area or why the students were
05:49
choosing to go to school there?
05:50
Yeah.
05:53
Several.
05:54
You know, one was—this was in the ‘80s, and I believe, I’m not quite
06:01
sure exactly right now, but back then
06:06
when individuals wanted to go abroad, Singaporeans wanted to go abroad for
06:12
study, they definitely wanted to go to an institution that was recognized
06:19
by the local government, right.
06:21
Because, you don’t want to go to some place that was not
06:24
recognized and then come back and not have your degree recognized.
06:28
So that was one reason.
06:30
And, the U of O, the fact that it was a state school,
06:35
was a recognized institution.
06:39
Tuition and fees for an international student, Eugene compared to other
06:45
state schools, I mean, you know, i.e. UCLA—much cheaper at that time, so
06:52
that was another big, big factor.
06:56
And, at that time, I know the U of O has since changed its admissions
07:01
policy, but at that time, the U of O did a rolling admissions, you know,
07:07
had a rolling admissions policy.
07:09
So,
07:12
a student could apply to be admitted, you know, and enrolled from winter terms,
07:18
you know, as opposed to—there were other universities where you only start school
07:21
in the fall, and the U of O wasn’t one of those - you could come in the
07:26
spring, you know, or in fall or winter.
07:30
And so, that made it convenient.
07:33
And
07:37
the final sort of like big reason was that
07:45
the Singapore education system--at that time, students were only
07:52
doing the British-based, the Cambridge-based GCE or A levels exam.
07:59
And, we got our exam results typically in January or, you know, you took the
08:08
exams September through, you know—or October through December, sometime
08:14
around then during that window.
08:16
And by the time the exams are graded, so a lot of it was graded in Cambridge,
08:22
and so by the time it came back, so we’d only know the results maybe in
08:29
January, February.
08:31
And so if you didn’t do well, right, you know, and you had blown your chances
08:37
of being admitted in the university in Singapore at that time, that means,
08:45
you had to go elsewhere, right.
08:48
The whole application procedure, right, I mean, you know, it was
08:52
favorable at the U of O. You know, it’s like, by the time—if you found
08:55
out in March, like darn, you know, I can’t go to the National University
09:00
of Singapore, I have to start this application process to apply for school.
09:05
Possibly, you had missed the deadlines for fall, but you’d not missed the
09:10
deadlines for winter yet; so it’s like, here’s a school that would
09:18
possibly admit me in the winter, you know.
09:21
So a lot of Singaporeans did that, including myself.
09:26
I happened to stay on all four years; others, you know, used that as a
09:30
stepping stone because they knew that that was the ticket to start as soon
09:35
as possible and that after the first year, transferred elsewhere, you know,
09:41
to the school that they actually wanted to go to but had not applied yet because
09:45
they had missed deadlines, you know.
09:47
So you mentioned that your brother and your cousin had also come to the
09:51
United States to study, did you have other siblings that also came, or…?
09:56
I have a younger sister, and she didn’t come to the U.S., but she went to—she did
10:02
her post-secondary education in Australia.
10:05
Oh, nice.
10:06
And so, was your intention to come study here and return to Singapore,
10:10
or were you thinking that you wanted to stay in the United States, or would
10:14
you decide maybe after living here?
10:16
Did you have a plan?
10:19
I think,
10:22
you know, I didn’t have a firm plan.
10:25
There wasn’t anything specific, you know.
10:29
I’ve heard, like, after I’ve been here and made friends at U of O, where definitely
10:36
there were friends—not necessarily from Singapore, just from other places—where
10:42
their intent was to stay here by crook.
10:44
For me, I was open to staying here if there were opportunities.
10:51
I was not averse to going back either, depending on whatever opportunities.
10:58
So, I didn’t have a plan, a firm plan per se; it was just you know, let’s just see
11:03
how things go, you know, and what unfolds.
11:07
Plus, I was, I don’t know, 21, 22, I mean I don’t think I thought much ahead.
11:14
When I think back now to opportunities that I missed at the U of O that I
11:23
should have, could have—I wouldn’t say “should” because I just didn’t
11:27
understand the process—but, could have taken more advantage of had I known.
11:34
You know, these days I think like, “wow, I mean, I never do that.”
11:37
Internships for instance, because I didn’t understand that concept, right.
11:41
So even something basic where it’s like I said I wanted a job but I didn’t do
11:45
these internships or things like this, jeez, how was I supposed to get the jobs?
11:49
And, you know, it’s like go figure, look at these friends that did it and
11:54
then found the jobs, found offers and opportunities to stay—I didn’t do that.
12:01
It’s part of like, my, I think, ignorance and naiveté, you know.
12:05
Just like, I just didn’t plan.
12:06
Right.
12:07
So what was it that you studied?
12:09
I studied, well I mean, I did a double in film; so film, but more film
12:16
theory and aesthetics and journalism in public relations and advertising.
12:23
Wonderful.
12:24
So you mentioned that you did go back to Singapore for a couple years
12:28
and then you decided to come back.
12:30
Did you come back to Portland then, or elsewhere in Oregon?
12:33
I came back to Portland, yeah, so in ’91.
12:35
And what was the reason for coming back to Portland?
12:39
Was there an opportunity in Portland that you were going after?
12:41
No, it wasn’t my first choice to want to come back to Portland,
12:44
Oregon, for that matter.
12:46
No, I mean, I met my husband, so we met while we were at the U of O
12:53
in Eugene; and so, we were dating.
12:56
And so, I went back after I graduated so I—I was on an international
13:02
visa so I stayed a year after and, you know, tried to find a job
13:07
but was actually very clueless.
13:08
When I think about it these days, it’s comical.
13:11
He was in Eugene, he was still going to school in Eugene; and so I was
13:15
limiting my job search, internship searches to just Eugene and never
13:23
even thought about Portland.
13:26
So of course I didn’t really find anything.
13:29
And
13:32
I didn’t know any better to seek counselling or to work with the
13:38
career center, you know, at the school so I didn’t find an internship.
13:44
You know, since I was on a student visa, so I returned to
13:50
Singapore after my visa was up.
13:56
But we-- my husband, you know, my boyfriend at that time--we were still
14:02
in this long distance relationship.
14:04
This was before the internet and Skype and whatnot so we would spend
14:10
incredible amounts of money on our long-distance bills—were just
14:16
horrendous from just the contact that we attempted to maintain with each other.
14:24
And so, and I had also strategically when I went back, found, you know—so my
14:32
plan was to find a job with an airline, an international airline, or maybe a
14:37
hotel chain knowing that these are jobs and these types of places would give
14:46
me employee perks, you know, in terms of like free ticket, annual ticket
14:51
to travel anywhere I want, you know.
14:53
And/or, have subsidized or free accommodation if I
14:58
were to come back to visit.
15:00
So, that’s how I went back and found a job, you know, with an airline and then
15:08
had commuted back a couple times too.
15:12
At the end of, close to, two years—it was just ridiculous, I spent more
15:16
money that I could have bought myself several tickets back and forth—so
15:24
it just wasn’t a sustainable plan.
15:30
The last trip that I had come back, previous to this decision to move back,
15:36
I was—I had come back, I don’t remember, I came back once for a work conference.
15:44
I was working with Northwest Airlines at the time doing marketing and
15:48
public relations and whatnot; and so, either it was that trip or one
15:53
other trip that I came back—I was having just a hard time navigating the
15:59
whole customs and immigrations check right after I got off of the plane.
16:06
This was, I think, in an era where a lot of Chinese nationals from mainland
16:11
China, especially women, were coming.
16:13
And there was this whole thing of Chinese women coming here specifically to,
16:20
wanting to stay for finding husbands or something, you know, and I don’t know.
16:24
So I had these questions at immigration like, “why are you here again? I’ve
16:31
noticed you’ve come so many times in the past year, plus. Why are
16:36
you here?” One of those times I was actually held at the airport for a
16:40
while with my passport taken away.
16:44
I wasn’t told, so I was just put in a room—I wasn’t strip-searched or
16:49
anything like that—but, I was just put in a room with no reason provided
16:52
to me as to why I was being held and why my passport was taken away.
16:59
And after, like, two or three hours just says, “okay, you’re clear to
17:04
go,” with, again, no explanation. I
17:09
made up mind,
17:12
in that very moment, I’m not going to go through this again.
17:16
You know, it’s like this is ridiculous, I have done nothing wrong; but this
17:21
is the way it is, you know, with U.S. immigrations and customs and whatnot.
17:29
I’m not going to bring—you know, I was convinced that, you know, I was not
17:33
going to win that fight and neither did I want to devote energies to complaining
17:38
or questioning what was this all about.
17:42
You know, instead for me it’s like, “I’m either staying here
17:45
or I’m not.” And so, I came back,
17:53
I think, summer-ish, you know it’s like 1990 or so just to visit my
17:59
boyfriend. And we talked through—it’s like, so are we staying or are we not?
18:04
And, you know, I stayed for that, you know, I think about the six
18:08
months, you know, I was allowed to on the visitor visa at that time.
18:15
At the end of that then, we figured, so okay we’ll get married, you know.
18:20
So we did.
18:23
So it’s like the whole process of then
18:28
staying together, green card, and you know.
18:31
So you went through that whole process and got through it?
18:35
Yeah.
18:35
Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
18:35
Great.
18:35
And yeah, you know, just because I just knew, I mean, I’m not coming back here
18:39
again if this is going to be, you know, there’s no guarantees that I wouldn’t
18:44
have been stopped at immigration again.
18:50
Again, it wasn’t like, you know, it was traumatic and whatnot, but I just thought
18:56
that was just not anything I wanted to put up with or I needed to put up with.
19:03
Plus, it wasn’t like I was struggling in Singapore.
19:05
I mean, I had a job, I had opportunities, so it was not like I needed to be here,
19:13
you know, to find a job or for a livelihood.
19:16
I had one, you know, where I came from and could build from
19:22
that if I desired, you know.
19:25
And so, did you parents end up staying in Singapore, or did they eventually
19:30
move to the United States, or?
19:32
So my parents have never been here, I mean, you know, as in residence.
19:35
They’ve come to visit.
19:38
But, they’re from Singapore, and, you know, and it’s never been
19:45
their intention to want to migrate or want to live elsewhere, yeah.
19:53
So then you moved to Portland in the early ‘90s, and how did you become involved
19:59
with IRCO, and specifically with the AFC?
20:01
So the AFC was established in the mid-90s, but how did you become
20:06
involved with the organization?
20:09
Um.
20:10
I moved back, and so, I mean, here is this—I was on a career path, and there
20:17
was nothing like that I could do here.
20:21
I mean, you know, Portland isn’t the hub for major international airlines, or
20:26
commerce, or banks, or anything like that.
20:33
You know, at that point--if I had not come back here, I
20:37
would have actually pursued an
20:43
undergraduate program in China.
20:45
I had already—my visa was accepted and I had a place waiting for me in Beijing
20:51
University, right, to do an immersion.
20:53
For me, it’s like, that was where I wanted to just brush up and focus on Mandarin.
21:00
And to, you know, possibly study—so after sort of like the, you’ve done an intensive
21:07
Mandarin immersion program, then to be able to transfer into just a university
21:15
system and to be studying Chinese history.
21:19
So I had my plans, other plans.
21:21
It was never this intention that, you know, I move back here for love.
21:23
That was about it.
21:32
But, I moved back here, and, again, it wasn’t like I chose Portland
21:38
because it’s like this place of my dreams, unlike my husband.
21:42
I mean, you know, he grew up in Wisconsin and he made that conscious effort to move
21:47
out to Oregon and the West coast because
21:53
he climbed and he skied, and this was one of those places that he wanted to be at—to
21:59
be near the mountains and the outdoors.
22:02
For me, it’s like, I didn’t have any desire to be in the outdoors—I’m a
22:06
city girl which is why I chose like a New York or a L.A. to go to when
22:14
I wanted to come to the U.S. So I came back here and I struggled as
22:21
to what I wanted to make of my life.
22:25
And,
22:29
since I was going back to—I wanted to go back to school and to do this thing
22:36
in Beijing, so I figured, it’s like, “well, I’m here.” And, you know my
22:41
husband was going to PSU at that time, had started his graduate program at PSU.
22:45
So for me, it’s like, I don’t know what I want to do, might as well go back
22:48
to school and figure that out here.
22:50
So, I started taking post-bacc classes.
22:57
I would have done—if I were to go back to school in the U.S., I would
23:01
have gone back and done film—there was no film program at PSU.
23:07
So as a post-bacc, you know, I just searched around basically; I did
23:11
classes in the history department knowing that I wanted to do Chinese
23:17
history, you know, in the mainlands.
23:19
So it was just things here tried, you know; I just got to know what
23:22
was being offered here, and getting to know faculty, and then found my
23:29
way into the graduate program in the speech-communication department.
23:35
It was true there, and my husband and a friend of his—who actually we knew
23:44
even from Eugene days—she was then, at that time, going to a grad program in
23:51
the same department as my husband and, I think, just about finished; and she
23:59
was applying for jobs, and then she had applied for a job at IRCO at that time.
24:07
That was how I got to know about IRCO.
24:10
I didn’t necessarily know before that that there was a refugee community in Portland.
24:18
But, this friend of ours, Linda, had applied and gotten
24:22
this job at IRCO, right.
24:26
That was just then as this, “hmm, interesting,” you know, there’s this
24:28
organization. I didn’t necessarily know anything about AFC, I mean, at
24:33
that time, I think I was just more-busy trying to settle in and find my own
24:39
life and find a pace for my own life.
24:42
But I remembered that, and one time I remember, I think, giving her a lift to
24:51
IRCO—this was, I think it was at Burnside.
24:55
You know, not even at the current building.
24:56
I was just like, “oh, this is kind of interesting,” and just forgot about
25:04
that.
25:05
During my own graduate school time, there was someone else in my
25:10
department, you know, who started the program a year after me,
25:16
then started volunteering at IRCO,
25:20
you know, right from her first year of graduate school.
25:22
So, to me that was like, “oh here’s another person and here’s
25:25
that IRCO name again.” And,
25:32
a little later--also true, you know, it’s like grad school connections—I
25:38
was teaching, I was a graduate teaching assistant, but I also adjunct, after
25:46
I’d finish and also adjunct instructor teaching in a cultural communication
25:52
classes there and at Mt. Hood.
25:55
But, one of my grad school pals, who I think was working with IRCO in one
26:03
of the AFC-based programs, had said something like, “hey, you know I’m
26:07
involved in this project now, and it’s this intercultural thing since,
26:11
you know, you teach so much of this intercultural and you’ve got this unique
26:15
perspective, you know, of intercultural and you’re doing things quite differently.
26:21
You know, we’re looking for people to participate in one of these,
26:25
this project that we’re working and would you like to come?” And, you
26:29
know, I was like, “sure, why not.
26:31
I mean, what’s involved?” And so, she told me a little bit more that there would be
26:35
some trainings offered, you know, from these guests--people from D.C. or whatever
26:41
talking about, just, community organizing, or getting non-English speaking
26:48
populations to be able to organize and mobilize themselves better, and
26:54
navigating this cultural landscape here.
26:57
So, I thought that was all interesting, so I attended a few of
27:06
those trainings.
27:06
During one of the breaks I was speaking to this person, Rebecca, my friend,
27:11
and we were just lamenting about budget cuts within higher education
27:16
system, and whether we would have our jobs at PSU for much longer—you
27:23
know with all these budget cuts.
27:25
And, Mr. Lee from AFC happened to actually had listened-in and heard some of this;
27:33
and, at that time, I mean, had just said something like, “you know, would you
27:37
be interested to work for AFC or for IRCO?” And I was like, “hmm, you know,
27:45
that’s an interesting thought.” You know, I didn’t really think about it.
27:48
On the one hand, I was worried about whether I would have a job at PSU,
27:52
but I wasn’t necessarily thinking about IRCO, working for IRCO.
27:57
So, you know, I definitely made that contact with Lee.
28:07
And things sort of, like, settled themselves and solved themselves at PSU,
28:12
and I had my job, you know, so I went on doing that—so, I had forgotten about IRCO
28:18
or the possibility of working for a job.
28:21
But, at the same time, I was intrigued.
28:24
So, after a little while, with
28:31
the budgets and whatnot at PSU, and for me, knowing that oh my gosh, you know,
28:36
it’s like, as an adjunct masters level instructor, I’m always going to be at
28:42
the lowest of the totem pole within academia in an institution like PSU.
28:48
You know, especially with budget cuts and the PhD now coming to teach
28:52
some of the, just, even basic 100 and 200-level classes that were usually
28:57
assigned or funneled out to instructors.
29:00
At
29:02
a certain point I just felt that, you know, it was time to explore other things.
29:08
So rather than just applying to IRCO, because I just didn’t know
29:11
enough still, I thought, for IRCO, I started volunteering at IRCO.
29:16
So I volunteered in a couple programs, went to, you know, the website or whatever
29:21
and just looked and then was hooked into a couple of the adult workforce
29:26
programs run out of the main building.
29:30
One
29:32
was a home-volunteer
29:37
assignment to teach English, so I worked for this Vietnamese
29:42
couple for over a year.
29:44
And then, one was a once or twice a week assignment in one
29:51
of the IRCO classrooms assisting.
29:54
What
29:57
was interesting was that true, that process when I was volunteering, both the
30:02
volunteer coordinator and the classroom instructor were saying like, “hey, you
30:06
know you’ll be so good working here. Have you ever thought about applying?”
30:12
So, I think, finally when I was ready to just quit working at a Mt. Hood
30:18
or a PSU, it was about the time when I saw all these jobs posted at IRCO.
30:26
I applied and, you know, sort of like, that was, you know, and I got
30:30
the interview and I got, you know.
30:32
And around what year was this that you started volunteering?
30:35
Was this the last ‘90s, early 2000s, or?
30:36
No, this was in the 2000s.
30:39
So this was, maybe, 2001-ish or so was when I first started volunteering—2001,
30:53
2002, something like, you know, yeah.
30:55
Around there because I was hired in at the end of 2003 or 4, or 2004.
31:01
Yeah, so if I just count back, you know, a couple years, yeah.
31:04
So what was the position that you were hired for?
31:07
Or was it where you initially started?
31:09
So I started as a SUN site manager for, it was [?] Middle School at that
31:16
time, the school has since become, has morphed into Harrison Park K-8.
31:24
It was, yeah—so I came in as a SUN site manager, and the ironic
31:30
thing was that wasn’t even the job that I applied for when I
31:35
applied.
31:36
I had looked at all the jobs that were open, and I thought, well this SUN
31:41
site running after-school programing and whatnot, you know it’s like,
31:46
I think I can do it but I don’t really have that direct experience.
31:50
So, I was looking at the job announcements, you know, I think, and
31:54
just going through each thing and, you know, being literal and thinking things
31:59
like, “I can do it, but you know, don’t know.” So, actually never applied,
32:04
had applied for a program coordinator position to do academic sort of like
32:13
programing and coordination, especially directly coming out from my experience
32:18
at PSU and Mt. Hood, just thinking things like, “Well, I mean I can do this.”
32:25
I’d applied for one other position, I think it was some youth
32:30
advocate or case manager position.
32:34
But when I got the call back, you know I mean, I got the call back and I was kind
32:39
of excited and the person says, “Would you like to come for this interview?” I
32:43
remember it’s like in and of the moment, making a note of the time and the day.
32:49
It wasn’t until I’d put down the phone, you know, and hung up that I
32:53
realized, “hey, I thought she said SUN site something or other,” I
32:56
says, “I didn’t apply for that one.”
33:00
You know.
33:02
You know, and having worked in HR before in Singapore--you know, my mother used
33:07
to do that - and just knowing how the whole interview process, so I says,
33:11
“They must be calling a lot of people, maybe they confused me or, you know,
33:15
interview schedules or whatnot.” So I called back right away and said, “hey,
33:20
you know, let me clarify the interview appointment that you just gave me.
33:28
I think you said SUN site, is that correct?” And she said, “Yes.” And I
33:33
said, “But, you know, I just want to make sure you’re aware that I didn’t
33:36
apply for this position, is this a mistake?” And the person on the other
33:42
line says, “Oh no, I mean you know, but we think that, you know, you may
33:47
be a good candidate to apply for this.
33:49
Are you interested?” And I was like, “Sure, why not,” you know.
33:56
So was that explained to you in the interview process?
33:58
Did someone who was reviewing your application see the potential and they
34:02
thought that you would be a good fit?
34:05
It never, you know—I don’t recall that it was ever explained to me, but
34:12
I mean, I just remember that after that phone conversation, I did—I mean,
34:17
coming from a research background, you know, after I hung up the phone,
34:22
I did my darndest to find out what is the SUN program and look through the
34:30
job description and make sure that I could—I had already in my mind, sort of
34:37
like, going through like every bullet point, you know, as the expected duties.
34:43
Just doing my own inventory of what have I done; if not direct experience, you
34:48
know, a transferrable, sort of like, core skillsets or experience that I could say
34:54
that in lieu of, you know, this, I’ve done this, that’s a closely matching.
34:58
So I had prepared and gone through,
35:02
drove past the school just to have a sense of what is the school population
35:09
like, where is the school located in relation to what kind of neighborhood.
35:13
So, had done all that work and had possibly—I mean, I don’t
35:20
remember exactly—I possibly had prepared, knowing I mean, again,
35:29
having worked in PR and advertising and marketing and
35:37
working with clients--I mean, I was a copyrighter as working kinds of questions.
35:43
So I knew that somewhere along the line--you know, having to make
35:46
pitches for advertising, you know, to be the lead advertising agency,
35:51
for instance, to win accounts--all these questions related to “why me?
35:57
why our agency?” You know, it’s like, “why do I stand out?” So
35:59
already having anticipated this probably a question on “why
36:06
are you interested in this position or what can you offer?” -- so I don’t
36:13
recall exactly in the interview if it was explained to me why I was
36:22
given a chance to interview, but, you know it’s like, I was prepared
36:30
to answer any of those questions.
36:32
So after you did the research then you were interested in the position and then
36:35
it was offered to you and you accepted?
36:39
I was interested in a position, period.
36:42
I didn’t need—I didn’t know, despite my volunteering for IRCO previously, I
36:48
didn’t know the, sort of like, overall scope of what IRCO did, you know.
36:58
I knew that they’ve got these job
37:01
positions that worked with these new refugees, so I knew that was covered in my
37:07
volunteer stint, in terms of orientation.
37:11
But I didn’t know about, say, the youth department or, you know, it’s, like,
37:17
seniors or all these other programs.
37:19
So, I knew I wanted to work for IRCO, or I’ve gone this far, you know.
37:28
The school that I was interviewing for happened to be located
37:33
quite close to my house.
37:35
So that was a plus for me on a personal level, nothing
37:39
to do with the professional.
37:41
I was like, “wow, this would be a good commute,” you
37:46
know.
37:47
And, just the type of students that I had worked with at PSU and Mt. Hood,
37:55
and having encountered many former refugees who then are in, what I
38:03
call, like this 0.5 or 1.5 generation.
38:07
They may have been refugees and then come here, you know, and then are
38:12
trying to fit in, or they may have come when they’re very, very young
38:17
and so are somewhat a little bit more Americanized and acculturated
38:23
but are still questioning, “I’m not Vietnamese and I’m not, like you know,
38:26
whatever this mainstream American whatever is,” and, seeing the struggles in school.
38:32
So I knew that—and then with my background both teaching and studying
38:39
intercultural communication—I knew I wanted to work with populations
38:45
to, you know, regarding identity and
38:52
acculturation.
38:53
And so, IRCO seemed like, you know, a good fit of an organization to work for.
39:02
Since most of my experience, work wise, had come out from an academic-type
39:07
institution, I looked at these programs, you know, or these jobs that I was
39:12
applying for with IRCO like, you know, well, you know, it’s working with
39:17
college-level students and I always felt like, you know, it was a little too
39:21
late--I wish I had the chance to work with them when they were in high school.
39:24
So I came in with this mindset that that’s probably like the age
39:28
group that I can relate to best.
39:30
Well, the school that, you know—and then the offer, you know, for the
39:34
SUN site place was a middle school which I was a lot more clueless about.
39:39
You know, I knew the high school programing; I’ve also done stuff
39:43
with elementary school, volunteering to teach dance with my dance
39:48
group, you know, it’s my PSU dance group doing just extracurricular.
39:52
So I knew how to relate there - but there was this middle school
39:56
group, I was like, “hmm,” you know.
39:59
This is an odd one, working with these six and seven and eight graders.
40:06
But,
40:09
I made it work, you know, and I was like—got to learn the school,
40:14
got to learn the kids, and truly got to love that age group.
40:19
You know, it’s like, when I look at school age groups--and to this day, that
40:25
middle school group is, I think, probably my favorite group to work with, yeah.
40:30
So can you talk a little bit about the
40:40
SUN school program?
40:41
So what the purpose is, the services, and the specifically what you do?
40:42
Yeah so.
40:42
The Sun school program, this is an initiative that we have in Multnomah
40:47
County—so it’s a county-wide initiative.
40:50
SUN stands for, it’s an acronym for Schools Uniting Neighborhoods.
40:55
So the concept is to have, to use the schools and in the extended day hours; or
41:03
extended day meaning before school, during the summer, after school, to use or to,
41:14
I guess, facilitate and have these schools become like community
41:20
centers - so, using the school as a center to unite the neighborhood.
41:27
So the school as a venue, a physical venue where programing and support services
41:35
and such could be created so that in the extended day there would a safe place
41:41
for students to engage, and students primarily from that particular school.
41:49
I mean, it may—there is flexibility to enroll students
41:54
from other schools, for instance.
41:56
But, the fact that the plan is to have, to make every school a SUN school, so,
42:02
you know, to each school to be linked more closely with its immediate school
42:06
populations, right—so, the school like a community center so that there are
42:12
these student-based programs, be it academic enrichment, leadership and
42:19
such, for the students.
42:24
Adult education-based events, so maybe it could be an ESL class, it could
42:28
be a fitness class, it could be a financial literacy class, or parenting
42:34
class to have the opportunity to offer adult education, right, that maybe
42:41
the parents, the relatives of the students would like to come attend.
42:47
And to work with the school, to organize school-wide events, so to be
42:53
involved with back to school nights, conferences, maybe spring celebrations,
42:59
multicultural events so that the school becomes more inviting for the various
43:08
parents and individuals who have some connection, maybe to a student to want
43:14
to come into the school, to step foot.
43:16
So that’s the, in a nut shell, the concept of a SUN school.
43:25
A lot of the work is the ability to leverage resources, to secure partnerships
43:35
with other organizations, to be able to bring their programing into the school.
43:43
For example,
43:47
let’s say, a YMCA or Caldera, and arts program, right, you know: so at the SUN
43:55
school, it’s maybe, like, them working a partnership with the Y or Caldera
44:01
since they’ve got an arts curriculum, an arts program, for them to able
44:07
to offer the program on-site for the particular population at the schools.
44:14
So, leveraging partnerships and then the recruitment, you know, all the
44:19
things that I think every community center would have to do: so, promotion
44:23
and registration, recruiting kids,
44:29
in the day-to-day making sure that its safe and that kids and instructors are
44:37
where they should be, monitoring just the functioning of the program, and working
44:45
with businesses maybe for donations, supplies, food, whatnot, raising awareness
44:51
of the school, the school community, the needs, everything almost and anything
44:58
to unite neighbors and resources.
45:04
So how do you go about addressing the needs of the community?
45:09
So, what the students are interested in or do you pick things and offer and
45:16
see if there’s interest, or do you ask first to see if there’s interest
45:19
in arts program or it’ll depend?
45:19
Both.
45:19
Both, yeah.
45:20
So, there’s a fair amount of surveying that gets done ahead of time--to
45:31
survey the various populations, right, a student population, their parents,
45:37
the teachers, neighbors, you know.
45:40
It’s like, “if I were to start a yoga class, would you be
45:43
interested to attend?” for instance.
45:47
And so, there’s a fair amount of surveying that takes place.
45:52
In addition to that, there could be partners that were already waiting, or
46:00
had been wanting to start programing--a community garden for instance, but had
46:09
been waiting for somebody or some entity to provide this oversight coordination.
46:18
Because they may have the resources, the raw materials, the dirt, the tools,
46:23
and whatnot to do a community garden project, but to be hooked in with the
46:27
school, you know, and the populations, and to coordinate days, space, time,
46:34
who’s going to be where, could not be something that some other partner
46:39
organization has capacity to do.
46:41
So sometimes there’s already some of these programing pieces, that’s like,
46:45
wow, I mean, you know, could go right away if we had these other pieces.
46:50
So programing, it’s a little bit of listening to both, it’s a little bit
46:54
of here are already opportunities that are willing to come in tomorrow,
47:00
would have liked it yesterday.
47:02
But you know, it’s difficult, yeah.
47:04
And then a live and learn; letting programs—doing the programing and
47:08
figuring, like, well, we thought this but,
47:13
you know, it’s just like, it wasn’t a good fit.
47:15
And then, being willing to improve, and to be flexible, and to be able
47:21
to revise programing if needed, yeah.
47:24
And so you started out as the site manager for a specific school, but
47:28
now you are the program manager overseeing the entire program?
47:33
When did that happen?
47:34
So you started in the 2003, 2004, and then you were site manager
47:38
for a certain number of years and then you became program manager?
47:41
Or, what was that transition?
47:42
Um.
47:43
It was—I don’t think my experience at IRCO was typical, you know, of many others.
47:50
So I started and, actually within that first year.
47:54
So, we had three SUN schools at that point, you know, we we’re
47:57
just starting these three SUN schools; mine was one of them.
48:00
And within that first year, IRCO had already written these grants, you
48:06
know, knowing that they wanted to support these three SUN schools with,
48:11
just, a different layer of programing.
48:15
So, the SUN--the three SUN managers at that time was
48:22
asked to gather data from each school site and to offer input on needs and gaps.
48:33
So I was working with my supervisor on that, not thinking like, you know,
48:36
just stuff like, “oh, I mean you know, you ask for this—oh here.” And then I
48:45
found out, you know, maybe within five months, you know, into my tenure as a
48:51
SUN person that IRCO had been awarded this other grant through the city of
48:56
Portland, right. It was meant to support our SUN program, and they needed a
49:02
coordinator there and so it, you know, again, I was asked but not really, and
49:10
it all was good opportunity that I think
49:15
all lined up. It’s like, you know, “hey would you consider
49:18
coordinating this program?
49:22
It’s going to do the work specifically in the three SUN sites.” And I was like,
49:26
“oh, okay.” You know, I didn’t know what that meant, I didn’t necessarily
49:31
understand, I think, that doing the coordination for that meant not being
49:38
a SUN coordinator. It wasn’t clear to me; I was new to this kind of work.
49:46
You know, I just thought like, you know, like, “oh, this is going to be in our
49:49
schools anyway, and I already gave you all this data and we got this grant,
49:53
you know, and these people are meant to help our three sites. What’s there to
49:57
it?“ I mean, you know, it’s like, “Oh sure,” you know. And then I find out,
50:02
you know, that oh no, it meant that now I’m going to be a full-time coordinator.
50:08
Running this program and, you know, which would also then be the lead and
50:12
oversee the SUN, our three SUN schools.
50:16
And for me,
50:20
it was like, I accepted, you know, like both the position
50:25
and the challenge, you know.
50:26
It didn’t seem like anything that I couldn’t do.
50:35
You know, for me it was like, well I lived through graduate school, I’ve lived
50:38
through multiple research projects, what the heck, and doing thesis and gathering
50:43
data from so many pools; this is a walk in the park, I mean, compared to like
50:51
the level, all those, you know—and to do research assistances and whatnot.
50:58
So within that first year, literally, I mean you know, I was doing this and,
51:05
like, being the lead, you know, in shaping our SUN programs and, you know.
51:12
And then from there—so learning, just, then that coronation piece which, again,
51:21
I mean you know, I didn’t have necessarily this non-profit work—I didn’t do this
51:26
non-profit work like that previously.
51:28
But, to manage budgets, to talk to funders, you know, it’s all
51:33
those things—talk to funders like talking to a perspective client, you
51:37
know, in my corporate experience.
51:41
To sit in front—to recruit staff to work in, you know, these programs,
51:47
it’s like, well how is that different from in advertising and PR?
51:52
You know, looking for—or working in Northwest and sales.
51:56
It’s like, well I needed to work with others and being a part of that,
52:01
kind of, interview panel to select, you know like, my specific team,
52:05
support team—it’s not any different.
52:08
Writing reports, I mean, it’s like how is that different from writing
52:11
thesis or marketing reports?
52:15
And budgets, it’s like well, yeah, project manager, you know, to do those things like
52:19
an advertising plan, it costs this much.
52:21
So, I just plotted along and did that and then very slowly, yeah, from there,
52:31
leading into more just grant writing.
52:35
Before I actually—I
52:40
think this is about the time when I was volunteering at IRCO—I had
52:44
taken a continuing ad, you know, to Portland Community College.
52:48
So I had signed up for a grant writing class.
52:52
My husband, I think, during his graduate school days was—there was one term when I
52:59
think he was doing a grant writing class.
53:01
And I thought, well that’s kind of interesting, you know, it’s like, I’d like
53:05
to have or to learn more about that, but I didn’t necessarily want to take a graduate
53:11
class or seminar in grant writing.
53:13
So when this weekend-type, you know, class format came about through PCC, I took it.
53:19
So I understood it; then at IRCO when all these other grants came up, my
53:24
supervisor was saying like, “oh I need your input on this.” And I looked at her
53:27
and said like, “oh, I can write this, you know, this is easy.” It’s like.
53:30
And I translated that back to—it’s like, how is this any
53:34
different from writing a thesis?
53:35
I mean, thesis, of course, you phrase it in statement of the problem and
53:40
your theoretical framework and your, you know, methods framework and
53:44
whatnot, and where else this was.
53:46
It’s like, here’s the gaps that you’re addressing, you know, it’s like
53:49
coming from, you know, and here’s the timeline on the logic model, you know.
53:53
So it’s same thing, different words.
53:56
And they’re all—you know, it’s an exercise in argumentation, you know.
54:00
It’s like convincing, you
54:04
know, why, you know, you need to fund this because of these gaps or whatnot.
54:08
It’s like I am based on hypothesis, this is what I’m proving, or
54:12
based on these research questions, this is what I discovered.
54:19
This is the process; so got into the whole, sort of like, grant
54:23
writing exercise with my supervisor.
54:27
So from there, you know, from there then we wrote one grant and then
54:30
another one came about and we wrote that and we got this and we got that one.
54:35
And so, in that three, you know, so—about the first four years at IRCO—so within
54:43
that span of time, we had co-authored or, I mean, I was on this grant, you
54:50
know, development team, you know, and we had successfully co-authored
54:54
and written, let’s see, you know, it
54:59
was like five or six.
55:00
And I mean, you know, and they were all from different funding sources,
55:05
there was foundations through United Way, there was the State, there was
55:09
the Federal-type grants, you know, and then other county, city, smaller-type
55:15
things, you know, and then there were like subcontracts with others, you know.
55:19
So it’s just written, and I was like oh, you know, because I was like
55:22
going through this process and from there, incrementally it’s like, guess
55:26
what, you know, you wrote this grant, now you’re going to manage it too.
55:31
It’s this process where it became a routine, almost.
55:36
I mean, you know, that by default, it became this thing where from one
55:42
project, now it’s this other one.
55:43
And by the second or third grant, I just became a bit smarter, I think, about
55:50
this where I made sure that whatever was writing to, I linked back to some of these
55:55
other grants so I could build and layer.
55:57
So there was this other vision that I was building towards, and it just
56:03
kind of start spinning off that way.
56:05
And then—at the end of, I think, my first four years,
56:11
it’s about ’08, ‘07/’08, I actually left IRCO.
56:15
Then, it was a lot, I was managing some ten programs at that time.
56:20
You know, it’s like if I counted just the
56:25
budget, you know, it’s like portfolio you know of like all these—it just
56:27
was something like one and a half, one point seven five million.
56:31
You know, like, across all the programs.
56:36
It was a little too much, and I wanted specific things in my life,
56:42
professionally and personally then.
56:45
And I didn’t think IRCO was just that conducive environment for me to get there.
56:50
It was—by that time, it was all work, a lot of work all the time, long,
56:56
long hours, including my weekends taken up, and something had to give.
57:04
For me, it was I needed my personal space,
57:11
and I needed to
57:16
reprioritize my time with my family, you know, which had been
57:19
sort of like lost in the shuffle.
57:22
And then on a professional front, I wanted to learn a little bit more
57:26
about high school-based programming and do that, you know, to be able
57:30
to do it and learn how to do it.
57:33
And IRCO didn’t necessarily have the programs then, at that time.
57:38
So, I left IRCO and I went to take a position at Portland public schools
57:44
where one of the districts, to manage one of the federal grants.
57:48
That was lovely; I learned what I set out to do, to want to learn, right—high
57:56
school programing, learning how these kinds of things, academics support
57:59
programs work on a district level.
58:03
When that grant ended, or a year before the grant ended, I knew that, you know, I
58:10
did not want to stay within the district
58:15
for various reasons.
58:16
I mean it was just this bureaucracy—more
58:21
about the bureaucracy than actually getting some of these direct services
58:26
work done at the end of the day.
58:29
And, that was not how I wanted to focus my energy either, you know.
58:35
To be doing that, to be always, like you know, like there’s this game
58:39
that you played with principles or teachers or people in the district
58:46
office that I wasn’t interested in.
58:51
So, I started looking at where else I wanted to go, and IRCO was the top of,
58:59
you know, one of the top places that I knew that if I were to still continue
59:03
to do this kind of work, if there were an opportunity to come back to
59:10
IRCO, I would seriously consider it.
59:12
And to just again, I mean you know, it’s just like, through timing and whatnot, I
59:17
got connected with Lee again, you know.
59:22
We had lunch and talk and I says, “You know is there anything?” And he says,
59:25
“As a matter of fact, yes!” You know.
59:29
And we had a couple lunches just to talk about, like, what it would
59:33
look like if I came back, and so mid-year 2011, I came back, yeah.
59:41
And you came back to the managing the SUN programs, again?
59:46
[making “no” sounds]
59:46
Okay, it was something else?
59:48
Yeah, so I came back—everything comes full circle—I came back and there was the
59:55
program coordinator position open at that time for one of the SUN support programs.
1:00:03
So it’s a program within the larger SUN cluster, right.
1:00:07
So, it was a case management-based program.
1:00:10
The ironic thing was actually this was the position I had applied for way back then,
1:00:16
2003 or whatever, when I applied to IRCO.
1:00:18
It wasn’t what I interviewed for.
1:00:25
So that position opened up.
1:00:33
You know, Lee was saying “this is what’s open, are you interested?”
1:00:37
So I was like, “well, if it’s just this one program, yes” because I
1:00:41
want to scale back and scale down.
1:00:44
You know, I’ve done the many grants, I’ve done the fancy, glamorous school district
1:00:50
job, you know, with the big grant and the many trips to D.C. and wherever,
1:00:55
you know, it’s like, not interested, you know, in that immediate and coming
1:01:01
back to IRCO, knowing this is IRCO.
1:01:05
I mean, you know it’s a non-profit, you do a lot
1:01:09
with very little.
1:01:10
And I’ve done that before, that first stint.
1:01:14
And so he said, “Oh, this is just for this one project.” You know,
1:01:18
so I was like, “Good, exactly, that’s even better,” you know.
1:01:25
So I came back and, you know, it was just the--this is what we call the
1:01:30
SSSES program, S-S-S-E-S, Student and Support Services for Education Success.
1:01:35
So it’s just to be the coordinator for the SSSES program.
1:01:39
I was happy because it’s like, I don’t have to worry about anything
1:01:43
else, I just worry about this one program—it’s plenty good enough for me.
1:01:47
Well, of course, within six months, it’s like, “oh Lyn, how about you
1:01:51
do this other program now too?” You know, so from one grew to two.
1:01:55
And the SSSES is a big program in and of itself, and
1:01:58
there’s—it’s two programs in one.
1:02:01
So we have the contract for the African immigrant communities and then
1:02:07
one for the Asian Pacific Islanders, so it was two really, you know.
1:02:10
It’s like, and then within six months, it’s like, here’s a youth gang
1:02:14
prevention program, can you do that too?
1:02:17
It’s case managed-based too, and you know it’s like,--and from there,
1:02:24
then the process to like, let’s, you know, like get, be included
1:02:28
and put on to writing the grants.
1:02:33
So it’s just like getting involved in that process all over again which
1:02:37
was, I mean, you know, it’s fun—I
1:02:41
had not written grants during that time I was in PPS—the small mini-grants,
1:02:47
but not these multi-million dollar amounts, you know, and things with
1:02:52
many zeros at the end, you know.
1:02:55
And so, it was fun, good fun, you know, and invigorating to get back some of that.
1:03:04
From there, like you know--and we’re in 2014—so in this past year and a
1:03:10
half there have been many other grants,
1:03:16
and big grant competitions that have come up, so being more involved in that.
1:03:23
With the grant competitions, whether, you know, it’s like our
1:03:26
own grants or partnering with school districts, so people from the outside.
1:03:32
We’ve done that and then had also then successfully been awarded for these
1:03:37
grants, so the cycle sort of starts again.
1:03:41
So now, okay, so there’s these ones and then managing this and involved
1:03:45
in the start-up of several other ones.
1:03:51
When I left we had three SUN schools.
1:03:54
Then, in that period immediately after I left, there was the
1:03:59
county RFP competitions and IRCO
1:04:05
was awarded three more SUN schools, so there was six.
1:04:09
Just within this last year, within the last six to eight months,
1:04:14
you know, following these most recent grant competition cycles,
1:04:20
we were awarded four more—so now we have ten SUN schools at IRCO.
1:04:28
So, we’re just at the point, I think you know, where we’re figuring out where do we
1:04:33
want to go with Youth Department here at IRCO with these other grants and pulling
1:04:38
things a little bit more tight together.
1:04:47
The decision was made that, you know, it’s like, “hey we would like
1:04:50
you back to do the SUN programing, you know, there’ve been a few gaps,
1:04:54
can you help, you know, look?” You know, just from my just personal
1:04:57
experience of having run a SUN school,
1:05:02
the experience working with the county on SUN service system
1:05:06
programs, and my experience being able to link programs at IRCO.
1:05:12
So coming back and, yeah.
1:05:15
Well so, you talked a little earlier about vision.
1:05:18
So do you have a vision moving forward for these ten SUN schools, for the program?
1:05:24
Can you share a little bit about that?
1:05:25
Sure.
1:05:26
Um.
1:05:27
I bring a personal vision but, at the same time, it’s also something that then
1:05:36
has to be aligned with the agency’s vision, right--so
1:05:40
the overall agency’s vision.
1:05:43
And then also since IRCO Youth Department is somewhat at a crossroads
1:05:49
with these many new programs and
1:05:54
so there’s the opportunity to explore what the department’s vision is.
1:06:00
So, the—let me start with the big and then filter down, right.
1:06:06
So from the IRCO standpoint, right, to support IRCO’s mission—first of
1:06:12
all, IRCO’s mission is interested to work with the refugees, the newcomers,
1:06:20
immigrants, and populations at large to grow toward self-sufficiency, to
1:06:27
grow to a place where both sides, so mainstreams and new populations can
1:06:32
come together and can become stronger,
1:06:37
adopting the strengths of both, right.
1:06:40
And using the strengths of both to then grow a better space and place that‘s
1:06:50
integrated, that’s based on strengths.
1:06:54
So from there, then looking at the Youth Department and knowing that a
1:07:04
gap that exists in Portland in the schools, our services for newcomers,
1:07:15
services for English language-learners, and for many populations who do not
1:07:21
speak English as a first language.
1:07:24
So, as a department we are committed to serving these populations that I have
1:07:31
just mentioned, right, through a network of academic services-- so it could be
1:07:41
academic supports like helping them with tutoring, helping them to actually
1:07:48
eventually meet benchmarks in schools, right, and helping them if they’re in
1:07:53
newcomer English programs to able to navigate out of that so that they can
1:07:58
be in mainstream classes--helping the parents understand what this U.S. school
1:08:05
system is, how this school system is different from theirs, and how they need
1:08:14
to, you know, giving them the means, the tools to be able to participate
1:08:18
within the system - showing them the connections between school systems to
1:08:24
the larger society, how it’s connected, and what their role is in the immediate
1:08:33
school and then the outside system.
1:08:36
So, creating the bridges, facilitating the process where
1:08:39
they can get from here to there.
1:08:42
So, as a department, supporting this mission through all our individual
1:08:47
grants, and all its complexities, and funder requirements, right, but
1:08:52
that’s that overriding mission and
1:08:57
vision—to support.
1:09:00
My role coming in as manager of the SUN schools and still having my hand
1:09:07
in the SSSES program and the Youth Gang Prevention, these case management-based
1:09:13
programs, and working with the other fellow youth coordinators,
1:09:19
right, to come to a common platform regardless of program or funder.
1:09:24
You know, all our staff will receive this training, all our
1:09:27
staff will come to this place.
1:09:30
So what I inject there is a support of a department and IRCO vision and mission
1:09:40
is then also to create a layer in terms of training in terms of programing of
1:09:51
acculturation, right.
1:09:52
So, you know, it’s like, even if I start there, what does
1:09:55
acculturation in action look like?
1:09:59
Theory of change here would include then, you know--it’s like some awareness
1:10:03
of acculturation in practice--what does that look like and how is that going to
1:10:12
come down to a staff level so that they understand that and then work and do their
1:10:19
work best when you work with the kids, work with the school, with the teachers
1:10:23
to talk about positive acculturation.
1:10:26
Right, so that’s one layer.
1:10:28
Beyond that, to make sure that as IRCO-- and knowing that one of
1:10:35
IRCO’s strengths is to be able to
1:10:41
create this awareness and never negate culture, right, and identity.
1:10:49
It’s not about replacing my culture to become American, right, so it’s
1:10:54
like, how can they co-exist, and how can programing and support services
1:11:00
embrace both and celebrate both?
1:11:05
You know, maybe a new space is created with both.
1:11:08
But, to create this, you know, to create, bring, I think, you know,
1:11:13
on a theoretical, philosophical level these, sort of just like,
1:11:17
ideas into something more concrete that can then be seen in programing
1:11:24
across all our SUN school sites.
1:11:27
Our contracts, culturally-specific contracts in the SSSES are
1:11:31
for Asian Pacific Islander populations and for Africans.
1:11:36
These populations may or may not exist at certain of our SUN
1:11:40
schools, you know, that’s just not the kind populations they have.
1:11:43
Regardless, it’s not about, if I don’t have this population at my school,
1:11:47
I don’t do this kind of programing; it’s the fundamental belief that,
1:11:54
you know, we all are interested to support positive acculturation,
1:12:00
and we all can do this regardless of one kind of population or not.
1:12:04
How can we do it so that my SUN school programing, whether I have this population
1:12:10
or not, has some cultural programing,
1:12:15
yeah, that stresses this.
1:12:18
You know, my culturally specific program within the API SSSES, you
1:12:24
know, has some kind of cultural programing that stresses this.
1:12:29
Maybe focus on that, the API cultures directly but also outside.
1:12:33
If I look outside, cultural competency is not about just knowing your own
1:12:37
group, it’s about the group, but then it’s about then looking at the other
1:12:41
unknowns and striving towards awareness and, therefore, competency when you’re
1:12:48
able to look outside and explore beyond your own little comfort zone and group.
1:12:53
So, bringing that level of programing into all our programs
1:12:59
and our department to support, you know, the larger mission, yeah.
1:13:05
And so, do you envision more SUN schools opening, is that part of
1:13:10
the goal, to continue the program, to grow the program overall?
1:13:14
Well, the county does say that their aim is to make every school a SUN
1:13:19
school within Multnomah County.
1:13:25
In turn, at IRCO, right, I would think that we would like to be at the table,
1:13:36
at this table and to participate.
1:13:39
Continue, you know, so to continue our participation; we’ve got 10 SUN sites.
1:13:44
There are maybe close, coming up to about 70 Sun sites right
1:13:47
now, we’ve got 10 of them.
1:13:49
So we have a significant seat at the table.
1:13:54
I would like, you know, to support IRCO’s mission to continue to have
1:14:01
this seat, number one, at the table.
1:14:03
And if the opportunity arises and a fit is correct for us to, you
1:14:10
know, be in that position to be able to manage the SUN schools, sure,
1:14:16
yeah.
1:14:18
Great.
1:14:19
Well, in closing, would you like to share any of your--what you think are
1:14:25
your achievements, your success stories, anything that… You’ve done so much,
1:14:30
is there anything that stands out that you want to, that you want to share?
1:14:35
Um.
1:14:37
I don’t think it’s any specific program achievement, you know, it’s
1:14:41
just because it’s just been this broad landscape—a little bit of this and that.
1:14:48
You know, if nothing else, I think I just celebrate the opportunity I’ve been
1:14:53
given to be able to dabble in this and that, you know, and to make it work.
1:15:03
There’re some
1:15:06
programs or some things that I think, you know, have been more
1:15:11
successfully executed, right, sure.
1:15:15
But, in the big scheme, like you know, is that then what I would want
1:15:19
to highlight as a success, right.
1:15:22
Like you know, for instance, in this school, oh yeah, you know, like I worked
1:15:25
for two years or three years to get to this point where, you know, like we have
1:15:28
this final multi-cultural celebration that incorporated all these groups.
1:15:34
That was lovely, but, you know, does that then stand out as a bigger achievement
1:15:40
than, like you know what, imagine we had three SUN schools and now we have ten.
1:15:43
Is that a bigger achievement?
1:15:45
You know, not necessarily.
1:15:50
So I just, I think, celebrate that I’ve been given this opportunity here to
1:15:55
IRCO to learn a lot of this programing.
1:15:59
That I don’t know when I interviewed, you know, the original interview did I think
1:16:04
that I’d get from this SUN site position which I didn’t really know what it was
1:16:11
to where I am today?
1:16:14
To be able to leave and then come back in, you know, when IRCO was in a
1:16:20
different iteration, you know, youth programing was in a different iteration,
1:16:25
you know, was it better before I left?
1:16:28
Like I know it’s like, gee, I mean you know, it’s like, what happened to my
1:16:31
original vision then, like you know.
1:16:35
I don’t think I’m necessarily attached to any of that.
1:16:41
I—it’s exciting to be in immediate challenges, it’s tiring, I mean you know.
1:16:48
I am better these days at
1:16:54
exercising self-care.
1:16:55
I celebrate that.
1:16:59
But, I think you know, to be able—when I reflect, to be able to
1:17:04
think that, let’s say the last ten years to people doing - to do this.
1:17:11
My sister was an investment banker and, you know, at a certain point,
1:17:19
she was in a position where it’s like, okay so if you don’t have ten million
1:17:25
dollars, she’s not the banker for you.
1:17:28
That’s the kind of like, you know, portfolio she holds.
1:17:32
Well, I’m not that investment banker; neither do I aspire to want to be that.
1:17:38
But, when I think of like—you know it’s the amount of money,
1:17:46
all these tax payer dollars and grants and whatnot that I am managing.
1:17:53
I look at our SUN schools just in and of itself; each SUN school has
1:17:57
a general, basic budget of $100,000.
1:18:01
We’ve got 10, that’s a million dollars in and of itself there.
1:18:05
I add on these other programs, I mean that’s a lot of money, and so,
1:18:10
I am very grateful—I am, you know, humbled that I’m in this place and
1:18:16
space where there’s enough trust that has been granted me to be able to
1:18:24
manage to coordinate these programs.
1:18:29
Because that’s—and I take it seriously and with responsibility from a financial,
1:18:35
I mean, you know, if I just think about the money, I think about the many, many
1:18:40
staff that I supervise, and it’s also their livelihood, my being able to come
1:18:47
up with a vision to be able to get their buy-in to do this work, to sustain all
1:18:53
our salaries on a very practical level
1:18:59
is a responsibility that I take seriously, you know.
1:19:02
And that I’m actually in this position to be able to do this.
1:19:09
When I went to school to study film, film theory, you know, which is a lot
1:19:15
of philosophy you know, and the many, many minors that I got out of that, you
1:19:21
know, to do the international studies or the Asian studies or the political
1:19:24
science or the religious—did I think I was going to do this, you know, no.
1:19:32
Yeah so, it’s—I celebrate all that as a success, yeah.
1:19:37
Yeah.
1:19:37
Wonderful.
1:19:38
Well is there anything else that you’d like to share that we haven’t discussed
1:19:42
or anything you want to talk about a little bit more that we already
1:19:46
discussed or any closing thoughts?
1:19:50
Um.
1:19:51
No, you know, I think yeah, I think I’ve covered, yeah.
1:19:56
Yeah.
1:19:57
Okay.
1:19:57
Well, thank you so much.
1:19:58
I really appreciate your interview, it was wonderful.
1:19:58
You’re welcome.
