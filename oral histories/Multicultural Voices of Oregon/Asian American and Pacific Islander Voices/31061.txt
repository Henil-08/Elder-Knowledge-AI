00:06
My name is Natalia Fernandez, and I am the Oregon Multicultural librarian
00:10
at Oregon State University’s Oregon Multicultural Archives, and today’s
00:14
date is September 18th, 2014.
00:18
We are here at the Asian Family Center to conduct an oral
00:21
history interview with Mr. Lee.
00:24
To get started, if you could state your name and spell it out-loud.
00:28
Sure.
00:29
My name is Lee Cha.
00:31
Could
00:34
you please tell us your birthdate and your birthplace.
00:38
I was born in Laos on July 11th, 1963.
00:45
And, do you identify yourself as Lao-American?
00:48
Or how would you identify yourself?
00:50
Certainly.
00:51
I identify myself as Laotian American Hmong American.
00:56
Ethnically Hmong, and nationality-wise, I’m Laotian.
00:59
Okay.
01:00
Yes.
01:01
Could you talk to us a little bit about when and where your parents were born?
01:06
Well.
01:07
They were both also born in Laos.
01:13
Let’s see, they were born in the [?] province which is the
01:22
town or the state where there used to be the royal Lao family residency.
01:32
And,
01:35
we have been moving around but I actually was not born in that province.
01:42
I, let’s see, I was born in a tiny little province called Xayaburi, Laos.
01:50
And is that where you grew up?
01:51
Or did you move after you were born?
01:53
Well, actually, I
01:59
did, a little bit, grow up there.
02:01
I left—my family left Laos
02:07
in 1975—late ’75, early ’76.
02:12
I was probably about, maybe I’ll say, around 14 years old at that time.
02:18
So, I can say that I grew up in that part of the world a little bit.
02:23
And where did you move to?
02:25
And then we migrated to Thailand.
02:30
My family stayed there for about three years and then we came
02:33
to Oregon in, let’s see, 1978.
02:41
Exactly.
02:42
Just specifically to Portland or to somewhere else in Oregon?
02:45
Exactly, to Portland, yes.
02:48
Could you talk to us a little bit about why you chose Portland, Oregon,--why
02:51
your family decided to move here?
02:51
Well, I didn’t have a choice; but, you know, rather by design, it’s by default.
02:59
So,
03:01
during those days, it just depends on where your family would be sponsored.
03:11
And it depends on, you know, who will sponsor you and what state they reside in.
03:18
And so we’re very fortunate to be sponsored by
03:22
the metropolitan Baptist church here; it’s in
03:28
Portland, Oregon, here, so we were very fortunate to be resettled in Portland.
03:33
We like the weather here, so we stayed the whole time.
03:37
And was that connection with the church made in Thailand?
03:42
That is, I believe that is not made in Thailand.
03:48
This is part of the resettlement process that
04:20
just depends on who the sponsor agency for us--it’s Catholic charity.
04:23
I think they’re probably just going through a, basically, we probably have
04:23
gone through a lottery, you know, pick.
04:23
So there’s no real—I think the process there is, it just depends
04:23
on who sponsors your family and what organization—the, you know, State
04:29
Department as well as the United Nations High Commission and Refugee, all those
04:36
department agencies found who will be your sponsor agency and that’s
04:40
how you got picked and resettled.
04:42
So how about how old were you when you moved here?
04:47
Well, I was about to go to high school, right.
04:50
So that was good.
04:55
Then I went on to college here.
04:56
At Portland State University?
04:59
Yes, Portland State and, also, I’ve gone to
05:02
[?] . And what did you study?
05:04
Business Administration, yeah.
05:07
When you were younger studying business administration, did you have an idea of
05:11
what you wanted to pursue in your career?
05:14
Well,
05:18
to say the very least, you know, when you were in a foreign land, not necessarily by
05:26
choice or by economic desire, and when you were a refugee, survival and safety is all
05:36
you have in mind.
05:37
And so, to be very frank, I hadn’t thought much about it.
05:41
But just, be grateful for whatever opportunity that’s in front of you.
05:50
I think for the most part, the most important thing is how to survive and
05:55
how to be safe—safety and survival are the top during those times.
06:03
So, it was good that we were
06:07
able to resettle in the United States partly because my parents
06:12
were involved, you know, in the U.S. government during the Vietnam conflict.
06:19
So that’s part of the process where we got picked and selected to be
06:25
resettled in the United States.
06:28
In terms of career opportunities, I
06:34
had not thought much about it, but, rather, just pick up on whatever
06:40
opportunity there is right in front of me.
06:42
I knew that I have a very—I have a passion for human services, and also
06:50
very passionate about humanitarian issues around the globe—probably
06:58
because of my own , you know, personal experience as a refugee and the struggle
07:05
that our family has gone through.
07:10
Right.
07:11
So when you and your family moved here, did your family feel that there were
07:16
adequate services to assist them in the transition process and settling here?
07:24
Well, I think we were very grateful for whatever resources we had.
07:29
Indeed, for the first
07:32
couple of years we had gone through some public assistance to begin with, right,
07:40
because at that time you have nothing.
07:42
I mean, you came to this country with, basically, just nothing, right.
07:49
I remember my dad talked about having 20 dollars in his pocket and so
07:55
that was it.
07:57
But, we had no fears, you know.
08:00
And again, it’s all about safety and trying to survive.
08:11
We, I think, were here
08:17
and then my dad had to work immediately after that, as well as my mom,
08:23
to make ends meet.
08:26
The other thing about me is that even though I was a young man, I believe that
08:31
I didn’t have much time to be a teenager, you know, enjoying social life and
08:41
being a kid
08:45
because of the language and the culture barriers; I had
08:51
to take the responsibility of being the translator and interpreter
08:57
of my family so, that way, we could get around, so, that way, I
09:00
could help them with adaptations to, you know, the new life and to
09:09
our new life in America.
09:14
Because of that,
09:16
you know, I remember that our phone which was ringing off the hook—evenings
09:25
or early morning--when they know that I’m still home, when they know that
09:29
it was at a time that they could catch me; the phone was just ringing off the
09:35
hook.
09:35
That’s how I remember my young days or teenage years.
09:42
Did they, your parents, continue working for the United States’
09:45
government once they moved here?
09:47
No, unfortunately, because of the language barrier.
09:52
They both had to work in a factory—manufacturing
09:58
jobs, production jobs.
10:01
Even though my dad used to serve in
10:05
the, you know, CIA effort of rescuing
10:12
the downed U.S. pilot during the Vietnam War, or stopping the
10:15
rapid growth of the Ho Chi Minh Trail during the conflicts, and
10:22
having to gather intelligence information for
10:28
that operation.
10:31
But over here, because of the English language, that made it hard for him
10:37
to work for the government that way.
10:42
So, no, he no longer worked for the government, but rather
10:46
worked in just production lines as a, you know, private citizen.
10:52
Did you have siblings?
10:55
I do have siblings.
10:56
I do have a brother and three sisters.
10:59
Were you the oldest?
11:00
No, I’m not the oldest.
11:01
I am the
11:04
third child, so I have an older brother and an older sister.
11:08
Yes, and then two younger sisters.
11:11
Did they stay in the state as well or did they end up moving to
11:14
different parts of the country?
11:17
One of my sisters lives in Montana and the rest are in the state.
11:20
So, we’re very fortunate.
11:25
How did you become involved with IRCO and with AFC specifically?
11:32
I, let’s see, I began working for IRCO way back in ’81; that is when I first started,
11:40
you know, my college, you know, here.
11:48
I am part of the, you know, founding members of the Asian Family Center
11:53
and that is way back in 1994, is when we started the Asian Family Center.
12:02
So what did you start doing when you started working for IRCO in 1981?
12:07
Wow.
12:08
That was a long time ago, right.
12:09
I started—my very first job with IRCO--at that time, IRCO was not called IRCO, it’s
12:19
called Indo-Chinese Cultural and Service Center, and then later it become the
12:24
International Refugee Center of Oregon.
12:26
And not until the recent year that it got changed to the Immigrants
12:29
and Refugee Community Organization, though the acronym is still IRCO.
12:36
My first job with them is a youth counselor, right.
12:40
And then, later on, I became an employment specialist and
12:46
then--gosh, I’ve been all over.
12:51
You know, I’ve probably been through most of the IRCO programs except the
12:58
economic development program that I have not been working in there.
13:01
So, over the years, I’ve been working in different programs, whether or
13:07
not they’re a youth program, family services, employment and training,
13:16
interpretation, translation, our, you know, youth programing or the more, you
13:24
know, homeless, I mean, anti-poverty program which basically is a program
13:31
that helps to prevent homelessness at the early stage, and/or people
13:41
who are losing, you know, their homes or at risk of losing their home and
13:50
having to need rent assistance or mortgage assistance, or those kind of
14:00
things.
14:00
Even domestic violence programs, right.
14:02
So I’ve been in all of those different programs.
14:06
And, let’s see, I became the Asian Family Center director shortly after
14:17
it was found, and then also I became the associate director of IRCO
14:22
since, I’ll say, 2006—yeah, beginning 2006, yeah, yeah about that time.
14:32
And were you initially recruited to work for the organization or did you
14:36
seek it out because you were interested in the services that it provided?
14:40
This was back in 1981 when you first began.
14:43
Well, actually both.
14:46
You know, I was seeked out, and then at the same—well, during those
14:50
days we--during the large influx of the Indo-Chinese refugees after
14:56
the Vietnam War, you know, during those days, we had very few people
15:02
that had the proficiency in the English language among our community.
15:09
I can remember, you know, a community of, you know, six or seven thousand
15:14
and there were only four or five of us.
15:16
So, you know, it’s a—I could say that during those times, you
15:21
know, let alone those who have,
15:25
you know, a college education, but just the people who can master the English
15:30
language, it was, you know, difficult enough and very limited during those
15:39
times.
15:39
So, what was the process of founding the AFC?
15:43
So, what were the conversations that were happening in terms of the
15:47
need for the Asian Family Center?
15:48
And, how did that come about and your involvement in that?
15:53
Well, I can say that during those times it has--I think, two strategies
16:03
has been emerged at that time.
16:06
One, is in totally IRCO at that point; there’s a team of us that have
16:14
been thinking about being on refugee resettlement because the need of
16:20
our community is beyond resettlement services because, mainly, resettlement
16:27
services during those times were just, you know, case management, support
16:31
services, employment and training.
16:33
So,
16:35
you know, we realized that the need for our community, it’s gone beyond that.
16:41
So, the other effort is that a community effort that was also
16:51
established, or came together.
16:54
First it began with
16:58
a problem among our children, refugee children, that at that time, the
17:05
youth gang phenomenon - it’s really begun with the Asian population
17:11
in the city of Portland at that time.
17:14
And so, not only that, but we also had a disproportionate Asian youth
17:23
who are in the correction system.
17:27
So at that time, when we talk about, you know, minority overrepresentation
17:33
in the correction system, we’re talking about Asian and African-American.
17:40
But today, we’re talking about that then we’re talking about our
17:45
African-American and our Latino community.
17:48
So during the late, or you know, the ‘80s and the ‘90s, the youth gang problem
17:56
for Asian communities is really bad.
18:01
Not only that our young people are getting into this behavior, you know,
18:06
organized crime, but, you know, violence among our community in regard to
18:16
youth gangs, it’s really really bad.
18:19
I remember we have to deal with extortion, business extortion,
18:22
home-invasion, robbery, and gun violence—my god, it was bad.
18:31
Not only that, but, you know, most of our kids…I mean, later on, many of our kids
18:37
were committed to a major life in crime.
18:40
And so, because of that, a community effort also came together at that point.
18:45
So, interestingly enough, it was led by Congressman Ron Wyden then.
18:52
You know, he actually designated one of his staff to work with us trying to,
18:59
you know, organize our community to plan and think about, you know, the different,
19:05
you know, strategies of how we could address to this, you know, social problem.
19:11
And
19:14
then, you know, later on came
19:21
[?] , who became Multnomah County Chair.
19:23
And so, she took on, you know,
19:31
this initiative and really then helping us to put the Asian Family Center
19:39
concept forward as part of the county Youth and Family Center system then.
19:45
The Asian Family Center become the very first culturally-specific center
19:51
in Multnomah County Youth and Family Center’s system.
19:55
So, you know, to begin with, we have
20:01
our, at that point we called it the level seven which is, you know, a
20:07
program that also had the relationship to the state and protective services.
20:14
Level seven is basically kids who may not be…who are high-risk but
20:19
have not been adjudicated yet.
20:21
The emphasis there is to prevent them from further going into, you know, the state
20:27
or, you know, juvenile justice system.
20:31
So, that is one of the programs that we begun to implement along with the
20:37
youth gang prevention and intervention program, and then later on expand
20:42
to the early childhood programs as well as the, you know, homeless
20:49
prevention or anti-poverty programs.
20:53
And then, our program just grew from then on to domestic violence services to
21:01
much more so into youth and family and health education and
21:07
community development programs.
21:09
Later
21:09
on, when this system became the SUN Service System, we are also
21:17
part of that new initiative.
21:21
That’s how, you know, it, the Asian Family Center, become a reality for
21:28
the Asian Pacific Islander community.
21:30
Wonderful.
21:33
What did—what were some of your duties as the director of the Asian Family Center?
21:39
What were some of the things that you did and what was your mission, your vision
21:43
for the AFC when you first started?
21:45
Well,
21:48
originally—I think, as a director, there are multiple roles that I
21:56
have to play, not only providing the leadership necessary to continue
22:03
to develop programs and trying to respond to the needs of the community.
22:13
You know, as a director, I’ve been providing the leadership
22:15
necessary to continue to develop and grow the organization as one.
22:24
The other piece is the management role where you need to oversee a
22:33
lot of the day-to-day operation.
22:35
That means that you have to have a very good,
22:40
you know, management team with you, a very good business team with you.
22:46
And so, that means that I need to be able to function effectively at all
22:54
those different levels because, I mean, being a director you need to provide
23:02
the vision, you need to also make sure that there is a, you know, strong
23:07
infrastructure to manage your programs and manage your resources and manage
23:13
your, you know, personnel—you name it.
23:15
I mean, it’s just
23:20
very
23:22
complex when it comes to managing a, you know, full-bloom non-profit organization.
23:34
I think one good thing is that having the background of business administration,
23:41
you know, it’s really helped to prepare me, not only to provide good vision for
23:50
the organization but, you know, also for the implementations and management
23:57
and administrative side of things too.
24:00
That has been a very rewarding experience for me.
24:07
So….
24:09
And, as a director, how do you work with the board for AFC?
24:12
What’s your relationship with the board in how you interact with them, in what you
24:16
need from them, what they need from you?
24:18
Can you talk a little bit about that relationship?
24:20
Yeah.
24:21
You know, the relationship there is a little bit different from
24:27
your—because the Asian Family Center is technically a program of IRCO.
24:32
So even though we look so independent, but, you know,
24:39
they’re our parent-organization.
24:42
Originally—going back a little bit, originally when
24:47
the Asian Family Center was
24:55
founded, we have three agencies that are, you know, coming together to
25:00
implement the Asian Family Center.
25:04
So IRCO was the lead agency, and then we also have Catholic Charity
25:08
as well as Lutheran Family Services.
25:12
Originally when the Asian Family Center was founded, because we wanted
25:19
to be able to draw the different service expertise and/or program
25:25
expertise to the table so that way we could begin implementing
25:31
this program right away.
25:32
IRCO
25:35
has unique experience in different kinds of programing, and also Catholic
25:42
also has different kinds of programs, and our Lutheran Family Services.
25:52
I think for example, I think, Catholic Charity may have much more
25:56
experience in terms of, maybe, the more
26:04
counselling services, more therapeutic experience, rather than you know IRCO’s.
26:12
Or, you know, at that time, I would probably say that Lutheran Family Services
26:18
probably had much more experience in children programs – things like that.
26:26
That’s how that first
26:32
stage of formation of the Asian Family Center had begun.
26:38
Later on, on our second phase of development, I think that is where,
26:47
you know, Asian Family Center then just became a program of IRCO at that point.
26:53
The other two partner agencies have dropped out.
26:57
Then, we continue to develop the different, you know, programs after that.
27:07
So, what do you see as the AFC’s main role within Oregon’s immigrant
27:14
and refugee community in terms of the services you provide?
27:17
And you provide a lot of services, so there’s a breadth of services
27:23
there, so can you talk about how you see the AFC assisting the community?
27:27
And, based on needs assessments, what are the main issues facing the community?
27:34
Well.
27:39
As a strategy, our agency continues to--in every two to three years,
27:47
we will conduct a community needs-assessment to make sure that
27:55
our agency reflects the needs of the community and/or addressing to
27:55
the trends of the environment of our
27:58
community.
28:07
That is one way for us to make sure that we reflect, you know, all API communities.
28:13
You know, the Asian Pacific Islander community is very
28:16
diverse, so do our needs.
28:19
Even though we have a lot of common challenges and concern,
28:25
but still, we have our needs vary from community to community.
28:32
Example: Economically some of our communities are doing much better than the
28:39
others.
28:39
Or, you know, academically some of our communities are doing
28:43
much, much better than the others.
28:46
So, it just depends on what community we’re talking about.
28:53
Things like that is where we want to make sure we reflect our community well in
28:58
terms of continuations of development or, you know, having programs that are able to
29:07
address to the challenge of our community.
29:11
Whether or not, it’s development or whether or not it’s operation,
29:18
we wanted to make sure that it reflects all of our communities.
29:22
To come back to how is our board work; the Asian Family Center board
29:30
are not your typical governing board.
29:33
So, because we are a program of IRCO structurally, the governing boards
29:41
are the IRCO governing boards.
29:42
But the Asian Family Center, we have an advisory board.
29:46
So basically, the advisory board are the board leadership that work
29:53
with me and our senior manager as well as Sokhom who is the current
30:01
director, executive director, of
30:03
IRCO to make sure that we lead the organization legally and properly as
30:16
well as providing, you know, advice
30:23
and recommendations of leadership to make sure that we’re accountable, make
30:27
sure that we are responsible and conduct the business the way that it should be.
30:38
Their function is a little bit different than the governing board; so even though
30:45
we’re meeting regularly and they provide a lot of leadership--whether or not its
30:51
fundraising, whether or not it’s how to promote organizations, how to make
31:01
sure that management and operation are running well and running legally and
31:12
properly—that is how we operate and how we work with the advisory board.
31:22
Basically, technically legally, they are the advisory board even
31:28
though they provide a lot of sound, you know, leadership and support to
31:34
make sure that their organization is running successfully, but their
31:40
role has been limited to advising and making recommendations.
31:49
One way that they also work is that we do make sure that we have a certain
31:53
number of advisory boards that [are] also sitting on the IRCO governing
31:58
board, so that way, it’s a much more stronger link in terms of how Asian
32:05
Family Center should be represented and should be marketed and should be run.
32:11
Can you talk a little bit about your role, your current role, as an
32:15
associate director of IRCO and how that’s different from being the director
32:21
at the AFC, how it’s the same, what that means in terms of your position?
32:26
Sure.
32:29
Some of my main roles and responsibilities as an associate director of IRCO
32:35
is—I have two critical functions.
32:38
One is to assist the executive director on government relations.
32:43
That means I would be the key person to represent the agency
32:52
on a lot of those governmental relationships and initiatives.
33:00
The other critical role that I play is to make sure that all program operations
33:09
are, you know, running smoothly.
33:13
So, one is, you know, taking on programs and ensuring that all those
33:21
programs are, you know, operating it properly, operating it successfully.
33:28
And then the other piece is, like I mentioned, the government relations.
33:36
With that, I mean, you know, I would work with our, you know, fiscal office,
33:42
I would work with our HR office.
33:45
And, you know, quite often, with all of the business that needed
33:50
to be done--whether its contract, whether or not it’s reporting
33:59
and make sure that we’re staying compliant, make sure that we are
34:06
operating all of our programs accordingly to contracts, and
34:09
goals and objectives are met.
34:13
Those are the two functions that I play as, you know, associate
34:17
director, you know, for IRCO.
34:22
And your government relations, does that tend to be just Multnomah County or do
34:26
you work on the state-level as well?
34:29
The state-level as well.
34:30
That state-level as well.
34:31
But, for us, the majority of our, you know, relationships with the
34:37
state--one core area there, is the refugee resettlement programs in which
34:44
we have to work very closely with the state refugee resettlement, you know,
34:51
office and/or DHS, for that matter.
34:55
Yeah.
34:59
So, some of the programs that you do with AFC in terms of fundraising, can you talk
35:07
a little bit about your role in that and how that works with community outreach?
35:12
It can be very complex; I’m interested to hear your thoughts on that.
35:14
Yes.
35:16
The one thing about fundraising is that the Asian Family Center, we’re not--the
35:23
way that I describe it—we’re not a very high-constituency-driven organization.
35:31
In other words, you know, fundraising, it does not work like you have a good
35:39
constituency or memberships, or, you know, like hospitals or college institutions
35:46
where you have much, much stronger institutions, I mean, constituency.
35:55
So, I would say that we very much live and breathe on grant.
35:59
So when you live and breathe on grant, it’s much harder, it’s much more intense
36:07
when it comes to your development.
36:11
We have done some non-grant
36:18
fundraising with our community, with, you know, just people that we work with
36:29
who have established relationships and those who are compassionate and passionate
36:34
about, you know, our cause and what we do.
36:38
So I’ll say that our organization at this point, we may not have
36:45
been that much of a success in terms of individual fundraising outside of grants.
36:56
At this point, I’ll say that that would be one of the areas that in the future our
37:01
organization has to be much more stronger and enhanced at, areas of fundraising.
37:10
But at the moment, most of our funds are coming through grants--either
37:15
governmental funding or, you know, private foundations, and/or corporate support.
37:25
That is, in general, what we are now doing.
37:31
Through grants, does that also mean a lot of partnerships with other
37:35
organizations or not necessarily?
37:38
It varies a lot, it depends.
37:41
Some granters or some RFPs, they encourage collaboration and partnerships
37:47
which we are also very good at that.
37:52
So, locally we work with many,
37:57
you know, collaborative partners or non-profit organizations.
38:01
We also work with other institutions like the school districts or, you
38:08
know, like, other research and,
38:13
you know, I mean, institutions like Portland State
38:20
or [?] , and that kind of thing.
38:24
Indeed, we partner with many organizations over the years.
38:30
I think, my gosh, I think if I go back to the list of agencies that we work
38:35
with, must be in the hundreds because we have very long lists of people who
38:41
we have worked with and partnered with.
38:44
Can you talk a little bit about the Coalition of Communities of
38:49
Color report, that report that came out that had many partners and it
38:54
had a lot of great information?
38:56
Can you talk a little bit about how that began in terms of doing that
39:01
research and then the data that came out of it, what you learned from it?
39:08
Yes.
39:08
A little bit on the history on the Coalition: Again, I’m part of the
39:14
founding members of the Coalition and was one of the original co-chairs of
39:22
the Coalition.
39:24
Interestingly enough,
39:28
collectively our community have struggled in a very similar way.
39:34
I think in the past we used to, wanted to, do it for our
39:40
self, speak for ourselves, and
39:44
hoping that we’ll be able to just represent ourselves.
39:47
But, over the years, I think, collectively we have learned that if you wanted to
39:53
overcome and if you wanted to promote bigger policies and deal with the bigger
39:58
picture, then we need to come together.
40:02
That’s really where the ideas of forming the Coalition, it really came about.
40:08
So, specifically about the research, after
40:19
a few years of
40:22
operating and coming together, we also have learned that in order for us to
40:27
be effective, we need to be able to
40:32
speak from a different way.
40:36
That means that we—you know, if I was to be able to be more effective
40:40
in asking for policy-change and for, you know, our elected leaders
40:48
and policy-makers out there
40:53
to do something much more tangible, then we need to have data to back
41:00
our, you know, our asks.
41:02
So that’s really where we started to, you know, working with Multnomah
41:06
County to ask them to start funding this research project in
41:10
partnership with Portland State.
41:14
So, you know, the whole idea there is that we wanted to really—how do we bring the
41:23
issue that faces our community to the forefront?
41:26
You know, we are very good at knocking on doors and telling stories, but
41:32
those stories need to go beyond just story-telling; there has to be some
41:37
way to tie it to scientific-method of, you know, bring it out.
41:43
That way, we’re truly not just talking from an anecdote position
41:48
but, rather, true facts, scientific facts about how well our communities
41:54
are doing in different areas.
41:57
That’s really where, you know, the thinking behind the research
42:03
really, you know, came about.
42:09
When the research came out,
42:12
many of the findings and recommendations was not surprising to many of
42:20
us, but some others surprising.
42:23
I think, in particular, in the API community,
42:29
we thought that certain communities would do very well in comparison
42:33
to, you know, others, but we find out that that’s not the case.
42:40
I think internally, we thought that, for example, like, our Asian-Indian
42:48
would do really well, right, but when the research came out, that isn’t so.
42:59
The other piece is that, if you were to lump all API students together, my god,
43:08
our k-12 achievement should be very—I mean, that number alone, that percentage
43:14
should be, I mean, should look so good and that we should be so proud.
43:19
But,
43:23
if you look at how only an individual community separately, then, my
43:28
god, that would then really show which community is so behind,
43:35
you know, in such a way that you never thought about.
43:39
So, things like that are some of the surprising things that
43:42
come out from the research.
43:44
The other piece is, it’s a bit surprise when it comes to how well
43:50
we’re doing and how prosper we are economically compared to, you know,
44:01
the other community or the mainstream community—well, not so; so that’s one
44:09
of the surprising things for us also.
44:10
So then,
44:15
what’s really telling is--there is truly and in some--whether or not it’s a
44:24
political climate, whether or not it’s a
44:26
social climate, or whether or not it’s just the way we are in Oregon or in
44:34
Portland, Oregon that, you know, people of color just [do] not fare well.
44:40
When this research came out, we see that how we compare to, you know,
44:48
like, King County or, you know, our neighboring state, we thought that we
44:53
are such a progressive city and town, but, well no, not quite—not quite.
45:01
There’s a lot that we have learned through that research.
45:06
And, based on that information, did the AFC begin to shift its services, shift its
45:13
resources to start addressing those needs?
45:16
Is that something that you’re now working on?
45:20
We, certainly, strategically have shaped our development, you know, plan and are
45:28
thinking about what community and how we may have to modify and tailor our
45:41
service-model in the future to address to those most-vulnerable communities.
45:47
I think, certainly we have done a lot of work in the areas of youth
45:55
academic and also family engagement of how—because whether you’re looking
46:02
at scientifically or practically, education is really going to be the
46:07
key indicator for economic prosperity
46:14
in such
46:19
a developed world, country, like America.
46:22
So, a lot of the emphasis has been truly looking at communities that
46:29
are most vulnerable; and if you don’t help those communities, then, in the
46:34
long term, it’s going to be much more harder to address to this population.
46:40
So, we have intentionally, in terms of our own development and our own--whether
46:48
or not you’re looking at actual service delivery, you’re looking at
46:52
advocacy policies, or you’re looking at
46:58
how you work with systems, school institutions, and every level from
47:07
service to delivery to, you know, decision-making and leadership-level,
47:13
how do we help to change the thinking, how do we help to change the how;
47:22
you know, because we may have the right “what,” but we may not have the right
47:26
“how.” That way, how do we begin to
47:33
change those methodologies or strategies so, that way, we can, you know, also
47:37
be much more effective in serving the most vulnerable population?
47:41
So indeed, you know, youth academic programs, family engagement
47:47
programs, and even in our
47:54
homeless-prevention programs, you know, we have really intentionally shifting a
48:00
lot of thinking in terms of, who we may be much more intentionally-targeted so
48:08
that way we can help to make the change.
48:12
So, those are some of the things we are now thinking in terms of how to
48:17
best address to our community forward.
48:20
And how important was the report and the data, not just the anecdotal story-telling
48:29
data but the hard-data that you gathered?
48:32
How important is that in your role in terms of government
48:36
relations and policy change?
48:38
How has that been received by the government?
48:43
Well, very important.
48:45
I think we have seen some progress; some areas might be right on, but some
48:52
areas might be very slowly coming.
48:55
I think
49:00
to the positive side, once this research and recommendations and data
49:06
had been done and presented to local governments and decision-makers,
49:12
certainly I think--like, school districts have adopted and have created equity
49:19
policies and, you know, creating their own equity lens and things like that.
49:26
So, those are some of the positive movements.
49:29
Also, you know, to our local government - city, county - have adopted similar
49:36
policies in creating, you know, a special effort to really use equity
49:43
as a way to, you know, really be
49:51
the center of all of their planning.
49:53
So that way, whether or not it’s service-delivery, whether or not
49:58
it’s resource-allocation, whether or not it’s policy-driven conversation,
50:03
that equity should be, you know, a very essential element of all of this
50:10
conversation if you’re going to be able to make some change to address the
50:16
disparity that exists in this region.
50:22
So, you know, to say the very least, I think the research and data findings
50:31
has been very useful, not only for our community but also to, you know,
50:36
local policy and decision-makers.
50:43
And you mentioned that some of the struggles and challenges are similar
50:49
beyond the API community; can you talk a little bit about how you see
50:55
those similarities and differences?
50:57
In terms of making policy change, is that something that you really have
51:02
to try and explain--that there are similarities but there are distinct
51:08
differences that need to be addressed?
51:09
Can you talk a little bit about how you balance those needs?
51:12
Sure.
51:13
Well I would probably say that, certainly—example like in the
51:19
education arena, sure, I mean it’s so uniquely, I mean commonly, you
51:26
know, across many of our community of, I mean, community of color.
51:36
Same thing, economic prosperity—very similar.
51:41
And/or opportunity.
51:48
Those are some of the similarities that we see that exist among
51:54
all of our communities.
51:58
I think that some of the things that may be varied, it could be, for example, like,
52:10
kids who end up in foster care,
52:18
or minority kids that are, you know, overrepresented in the
52:23
correction system, or people of color represented in the correction
52:29
system, period—adults or children.
52:32
So these are some of the
52:38
areas that may have differences, you know,
52:44
in some of our communities.
52:46
So I could say that, you know, like I mentioned earlier, in the ‘80s is
52:50
where Asians and African-Americans are the two target populations but
52:56
now it’s Latino and African-American.
53:04
You know, if you’re looking at income, my god, it’s so similar
53:09
among all of our community.
53:13
Living wage jobs, owning homes,
53:19
and, you know, what is the average incomes, I mean, if you’re
53:23
looking at those charts, it’s so similar facing people of color.
53:31
That’s why one of the strong indicators that would probably—I mean, even
53:40
though it’s easily said, it’s very hard to have a conversation that we are
53:47
the city and county and state, are we truly
53:49
having
53:52
an institutional racism that’s still in place or that still exists?
53:57
So, how do we overcome that, how do we continue to create policies where
54:06
[it] would help those behaviors, would help to change those structures.
54:13
And
54:15
so, I think, those are some of the, you know, common issues that are
54:23
facing our folks; even though, if you break down into different areas, some
54:29
communities may be harder hit than
54:33
the other.
54:35
You know, like, areas of law-enforcement,--and
54:43
that may be an example like racial profiling--it may phase
54:49
certain communities more.
54:53
It just depends on what topic and what are we’re looking into.
55:00
But, the one thing that become so similar to each other is the
55:05
economic prosperity; it’s just
55:09
not much different.
55:10
I mean, it’s just so similar that we’re not making it.
55:19
So what do you foresee as the next big steps for the AFC and for IRCO,
55:26
if you’d like to speak on behalf of IRCO as well, in terms of the next
55:30
five years, the next ten years?
55:32
As part of being an associate director, as part of your vision
55:37
for that, what do you see?
55:38
Well, I think that, you know, the Asian Family Center, I envision
55:44
that the Asian Family Center is still going to be a focal point,
55:53
one of the center that would be a home for and a resource for all of the
56:01
Asian Pacific Islander communities.
56:03
I’m
56:06
hoping that we will be able to continue to be the resource and the
56:12
provider for our community that way.
56:17
I think, certainly, you know,
56:22
as long as
56:27
the Center continues to look at the needs of the community and really
56:34
then work with our community to, you know, develop programs and resources
56:41
to address those issues, then we will continue to be the center for all.
56:52
The other piece that I like to say, that even though right now we’re able
56:57
to have staff that address to more than 28 different languages here on
57:03
a daily basis, I like to see that that should be growing in capacity.
57:10
I know that—the other piece that we also know is that the demographic of
57:17
the API population, you know, in the tri-county is going to continue to grow.
57:29
Not only that--not only that our birthrate or our migration of API population to
57:37
this tri-county, but also refugees and immigrants continue to, you know, arrive.
57:43
On that piece, as long as our, you know, national interests do not get changed
57:50
globally, we may continue to, you know, see more refugees coming to our state.
58:05
Again, forward, in the future, I am hoping that we don’t have to outgrow
58:12
this building again because we just moved to this building during 2011.
58:20
At this point, we’re pretty maxed-out in terms of space, but we’re hoping that
58:28
we will continue to grow in some way that, you know, we can steadily
58:36
develop a program to respond to our community needs.
58:40
Certainly in the next five to ten years, I could still see that Asian
58:43
Family Center is still going to be a very strong focal-point for
58:48
the Asian community in the state.
58:50
And as you continue to do needs-assessments within the API
58:54
community, do you foresee doing another joint communities of color research report
59:05
or something like that?
59:07
I think
59:09
we will probably go on to continue in two, I think, in two ways that I see right now.
59:16
One is how do we continue to deepen the research that has already been done?
59:22
Because, I think there are much more-detailed studies that needed to be
59:27
done or, you know, different communities or different, you know, topic areas.
59:37
So, to answer your question, yes; I see that, you know, the research
59:42
will continue to be a critical, integral part of our needs-assessments
59:49
and our research needs for
59:53
not only the API community but for all people of color.
59:57
Yeah.
59:58
And in terms of the immigrant and refugee population continuing to grow and people
1:00:02
moving to this area, can you talk a little bit about how that’s changed or,
1:00:09
perhaps, stayed the same from the time when you and your family moved here?
1:00:13
Now is this a place where people see that there are services and
1:00:17
programs that will assist them so they think about moving here?
1:00:20
Does that influence their choice in being here, or are there other ways, other
1:00:25
reasons why they might come to this area?
1:00:28
Well, I think, for sure, different factors.
1:00:31
I
1:00:33
know that for some whether or not it’s because of the resources that they can
1:00:43
seek out here, or just extended family, or just the existing community that there
1:00:54
is here, outside of economic opportunity.
1:01:00
You know, I think, our Asian community are very unique when
1:01:03
it comes to, you know, their own relationship with their own community.
1:01:09
You know, who they belong, and how they—I mean, simply put, we’re such
1:01:15
a community-orientated people, right; so, it’s still very true to many
1:01:21
of our, you know, API community.
1:01:30
I would probably say that the API population, when it comes to newcomers,
1:01:40
refugees as you stated, it will change.
1:01:43
If you could see in the late ‘70s, the early ‘80s to the ‘90s,
1:01:51
it’s all Indo-Chinese population, that means: Laotian, Hmong, Mien,
1:01:56
Cambodian, Vietnamese, right.
1:01:58
These are the large-influx right after the Vietnam War.
1:02:05
Between then and now, we saw so many different flow of nationalities
1:02:13
and different races or ethnic groups, they’re coming to our state.
1:02:18
To which I’m going to say that that’s going to change; for example, like
1:02:22
right now, we have the Burmese, the Nepalese, and the Koreans.
1:02:27
All of these are the newcomers now for the API.
1:02:32
And certainly, we anticipate to continue to have more African newcomers
1:02:40
and, you know, Asian—probably, you know, East-Asian or Middle-Eastern
1:02:54
because of the current conflict now.
1:02:58
We probably are going to have a continue to slow down on the Russian,
1:03:02
you know, speaking community.
1:03:09
That flow of refugees will definitely be slowing down to some degree.
1:03:15
The majority of them will go—I would probably say that, currently, right now
1:03:20
the majority of the newcomers are African.
1:03:24
So indeed, the population will be changing.
1:03:29
So looking back
1:03:31
for over 30, 35 years in terms of your career, in terms of closing remarks,
1:03:37
can you talk a little bit about your mentors and your community experience in
1:03:44
terms of all of your many jobs, your many positions here with IRCO and AFC and how
1:03:52
that played into your influence?
1:03:55
I’m assuming this--you wanted to stay, so this was a great organization; you felt
1:03:59
that this was, as you said, your home, so can you talk a little bit about that?
1:03:59
This is my home.
1:03:59
Well, you
1:04:06
know, as a former refugee, in general, I think Americans are very generous.
1:04:12
I know that sometimes, you know, the political climate and our global
1:04:21
issues may have influenced some of our behavior; but, in general, I will
1:04:25
say that Americans are very generous.
1:04:28
You know, my only experience—you know, I think that, to the most part, I think
1:04:35
that Americans are very welcoming; they are very hospitable towards newcomers.
1:04:45
Even though we were in such a foreign land and
1:04:55
that we may not know how to navigate a system or their system or understanding
1:05:03
their language and their culture, but I think to the most part, most Americans
1:05:08
are very generous, friendly, and helpful.
1:05:13
I’ll
1:05:16
probably say that,
1:05:20
you know, some of the very influential people—I’ll say that whether or not
1:05:28
its teachers, friends, or just church members, they’re very encouraging, so
1:05:38
the one good thing over here is that
1:05:43
a lot of people are having these positive encouragements.
1:05:49
So, whether or
1:05:52
not they’ll be able to do much for you, but at least, the sign of hope is there.
1:05:56
A lot of times, those of us who are—you know, whether or not
1:06:03
you’re into an unfortunate situation, or to most refugees, as long as you
1:06:09
continue to have hope, that is one very good dream, that is one very positive
1:06:16
thing that you have in life, and a lot of times people without hope is really where
1:06:26
you are getting to the bottom; so as long as you continue to have hope, and let
1:06:31
people give you hope, and let them give you encouragement, you know, for tomorrow,
1:06:39
sometimes that is what you want.
1:06:41
That’s all that you need.
1:06:44
You know, when you continue to have hope, then you will work toward it,
1:06:49
and then you’ll be at a better place.
1:06:53
Certainly, you know, its—this journey is not, what shall I say—you will not get the
1:07:03
answer you wanted immediately, but as long as you continue to have hope, then you
1:07:08
will continue to work toward your dreams.
1:07:11
And, day by day, year by year, you will see the difference.
1:07:18
One of the most rewarding, you know, of my 33 years in this organization is that
1:07:24
a lot of times when I see struggling families and struggling individuals
1:07:30
become somebody, not only become somebody but become very successful
1:07:37
professionally or very successful in business, very successful in life.
1:07:43
And that you may serve them today but five or ten years later when
1:07:46
you meet them, they become somebody.
1:07:49
I think that’s worth more than a million dollars.
1:07:51
I mean,
1:07:54
I used to say that it’s more than a million dollars, you know, for me.
1:07:58
And so, that’s one of the rewarding that I continue to love, you know, doing
1:08:07
social services and human services.
1:08:11
In closing, I’d just like to say that
1:08:17
everybody will need a helping hand sometimes.
1:08:21
And so, to have a resource where vulnerable people and
1:08:28
people who just need the little help to make a difference in their life
1:08:37
that is one thing that I’m hoping that, you know, we as society should
1:08:45
be very thoughtful about because we, as human beings, we all were born
1:08:52
equal but we’re not raised equal.
1:08:57
Regardless what race, what nationality, whether or not you’re male or female, we
1:09:03
were born equal but we do not raise equal.
1:09:08
So, you know, if we could provide them with the opportunity, my god,
1:09:15
it would make a big difference in those people’s life and that’s
1:09:19
what I’m so passionate about.
1:09:24
Wonderful.
1:09:25
Well is there anything else that you would like to add, anything that
1:09:33
we’ve talked about that you want to talk about a little bit more, or…?
1:09:33
No, I think that’s good for now, right.
1:09:35
But, if there’s anything else that I forgot, certainly,
1:09:38
feel free to ask me later.
1:09:39
Good.
1:09:39
Okay, wonderful.
1:09:41
Well, thank you so much.
1:09:43
Alright, thank you.
1:09:43
Good.
