00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández, and I am here at the Asian Family
00:06
Center in Portland, Oregon, to conduct an oral history interview.
00:11
Today’s today is September 18th, 2014.
00:15
So we’ll go ahead and get started.
00:16
If you could say your name and spell it out-loud.
00:20
My name is Danita Huynh.
00:28
Great.
00:28
And, could you please state your birthdate and your birthplace.
00:32
My birthday is September 6th, and I was born in Newport, Oregon.
00:37
And, how do you identify yourself in terms of your cultural or ethnic background?
00:43
I’m Caucasian, but my background is Norwegian.
00:48
And your parents, when and where were they born?
00:53
My father was born in Canada, approximately 1932; and my mother was
01:00
born in Arkansas, approximately 1940.
01:10
And you were born here in Oregon, so where did you grow up?
01:14
I grew up mostly on the coast in Lincoln City, Oregon, but
01:19
all over Oregon—Southern Oregon.
01:23
And I lived in Georgia for about five years and then back
01:27
to Oregon, mostly in Portland.
01:30
And so what brought you to Portland?
01:34
Back to Portland, or originally when I was younger?
01:39
Mostly just being by myself in Georgia, and I missed my family, and the heat.
01:47
I missed the roots of Oregon; Oregon’s just a beautiful place to be.
01:50
You have the four seasons, and Georgia is just pretty much spring and summer.
01:57
So, basically, that’s why I came back.
01:59
And how long have you been in Portland since you moved back?
02:03
So that was about, probably, 21 years ago.
02:10
Great.
02:12
So what is your current connection with the Asian Family Center?
02:17
So, currently I am the manager of our children’s programing, and I’ve been
02:25
here for about 17 years doing the same type of work, same programing.
02:33
And have you had any other positions with the AFC, you said “same type of work,”
02:38
has that meant different positions?
02:41
I started out as a parent educator for a couple years, doing direct services
02:46
through the Asian Pacific Islander Parent-Child Development Program
02:54
back in 1997.
02:55
I stayed with that program for a few years and then got promoted to
02:59
lead parent educator, and then to coordinator, and then to manager.
03:05
So,
03:08
the supervisor position started about two years after I started
03:12
doing the direct-service work.
03:16
Great.
03:16
What are your job duties, on a daily basis and overall?
03:20
What do you do in your position?
03:23
On a daily basis, my job is to support and supervise approximately 25 home-visitors
03:34
[we have four program coordinators that also oversee those home-visitors]
03:43
--collaboration with other programs; presentations to other community
03:49
agencies, other communities;
03:56
monitoring budgets and programing goals and outcomes.
04:03
It’s kind of—a manager is kind of—I also do some direct-service,
04:08
about a couple times a year.
04:09
I do home-visits myself.
04:16
It sounds like you have a lot of programs and a lot of services and a lot of people
04:19
to manage, so can you describe some of the programs, the services that AFC offers?
04:25
Sure.
04:27
So the programs in our children’s services here at Asian Family
04:31
Center--the two primary ones are Asian Pacific Islander Parent-Child
04:37
Development service which is funded through Multnomah County SUN Programs.
04:43
That program serves families with children living in Multnomah
04:47
County ages zero to five.
04:50
That particular program has been with Asian Family Center since 1995.
04:56
So, Hongsa Chanthavong
04:59
was the former
05:00
coordinator for the first years, and he helped to get it started off the ground.
05:04
Then when he was ready to move on and retire a little bit, that’s when they
05:11
promoted me to be the coordinator.
05:16
The other program is funded through the city, so it’s the
05:18
Children’s Levy Programing, Children and Parenting Success.
05:22
And, also, that program serves children zero to five and parent’s
05:28
living in the city-limits of Portland.
05:30
They serve Vietnamese, Somali, Russian, and some Chinese and Burmese families.
05:40
With the work that you do in terms of working with these children and working
05:45
with these families, do you seek them out?
05:48
Do they seek you out?
05:50
How does that relationship begin?
05:52
It’s kind of both.
05:53
Referrals come from a variety of sources.
05:58
The primary source is, probably, word-of-mouth, and, also, through
06:02
other IRCO programs and IRCO employees.
06:08
We get referrals sometimes from WIC, from
06:13
community health nurses, from community health workers, from doctors, sometimes
06:21
from DHS child welfare, and sometimes just people walk in and they hear
06:27
about our service or they read the flyers, they see things on the internet
06:31
and so they call wanting services.
06:35
Over the 17 years that you’ve worked here, how have you seen the needs in
06:41
the community change or stay the same?
06:44
How have you adapted to those changes?
06:48
The needs in the community have always, pretty much, been the same around needing
06:55
help for learning how to prepare the kids for school and for kindergarten readiness.
07:01
That’s really, for both of our programs here at Asian Family Center, the focus.
07:07
So bringing activities and parenting information from parents as teachers,
07:15
our evidence-based curriculum that we use -- bringing that information to the
07:21
families to share with them so they know
07:26
what they need to know in order to help their own kids be prepared for school.
07:32
The biggest need is just knowing what subject, what developmental domains, what
07:38
kind of things do their kids need to know for school here in the United States.
07:47
Once the kids grow up, do you refer them to other programs within
07:54
AFC, do you keep track of them, do you keep that relationship going?
07:59
How does that work in terms of as they age and as the families age?
08:04
As the children age into kindergarten, we try to refer them to youth programs
08:09
or academic assistance programs within Asian Family Center and IRCO.
08:16
For the parents, we try to refer them also to the anti-poverty
08:19
programs, as needed, sometimes to Care
08:23
Oregon—Cover Oregon, when we had the grant,
08:30
to the leadership program.
08:32
So there are a lot of other programs that we collaborate with, and we
08:35
do definitely refer the families to those programs as needed.
08:40
You mentioned collaboration outside of the AFC: can you talk a little bit
08:44
about your partnerships with the county, with schools, with other organizations?
08:49
Sure.
08:50
We partner with—formerly we partner with Walla Walla College of Nursing
08:57
and sometimes we get student interns, nursing interns that will come and
09:02
help on home-visits with medical or health-related information.
09:10
More informal partnerships would include: Oregon Food Bank, other
09:18
agencies such as SAI,
09:26
Impact Northwest, and Human Solutions for other anti-poverty
09:31
programs that they may have.
09:33
We also partner with the different SUN Schools, for both space and programing
09:42
that they may offer for the families that are enrolled in our programs but also for
09:47
families that might be on a waiting list.
09:49
We try to help refer them out to the schools as well.
09:53
We partner with Mt. Hood
09:57
and Portland Head Start and Albina Head Start and helping families
10:02
get either on the waiting list or enrolled in Head Start programing.
10:08
And does a lot of your programing involve grant funding, or how
10:12
are these programs financed?
10:14
Is it part of AFC’s budget?
10:16
Do you have your own grants that you seek out?
10:18
How does that work?
10:21
Primarily, with the two programs that we have here--in IRCO’s children’s
10:27
programing we have about actually 13 programs--two of them are sited here,
10:32
specifically the API PCDS program and that is funded through Multnomah County.
10:41
We don’t really seek out other grants for that particular program.
10:46
We get private donations, like from Danner during Christmas-time; they
10:51
adopt families and buy needed items for the families during the holidays.
10:59
We also partner with Les Schwab; they have a “Toy and Joy” drive every year,
11:07
we partner with them to receive donations for those families.
11:12
CAPS, our other program that serves the more-diverse populations, is
11:18
funded through the children’s levy which is the city tax-based funding.
11:26
More we just--we don’t really look for other grants so to say, but
11:29
we look for donations so to say.
11:33
Social Venture Partners have worked with us in the past trying to help
11:37
where the gaps are in services and needs that our programs have.
11:41
We haven’t quite yet developed some kind of in-kind or grant-funding through Social
11:50
Ventures but they know what the needs are so they’re helping us to do that.
11:56
Can you talk a little bit about the home-visits?
11:59
What is it that you’re looking for?
12:02
Is that both for you and the family in terms of building a
12:07
relationship, building trust?
12:09
Can you talk a little bit about those specific home-visits?
12:13
So the home-visits are typically an hour to two hours in length, one time a month.
12:20
Some families who need a little bit more support can have up
12:24
to two home-visits a month.
12:27
We always meet the family in the home if that’s where they prefer.
12:32
We bring child developmental activities to do with them and their child.
12:38
We try to bring a literacy activity at every home-visit to promote
12:43
literacy skill development.
12:46
Sometimes, we bring donations from food banks, sometimes we bring food,
12:49
or we bring gently-used clothing to the home, school supplies that might have
12:55
been donated, as well as bringing the developmental curriculum from Parents
13:01
as Teachers based on the child’s age or maybe something the parent is concerned
13:06
about - we try to bring some research data with us from PAT to bring to the parents.
13:11
We sit down and talk to them, explain to them how they can—we have some ideas
13:18
that we try to give them and just really working on a strength-based approach;
13:25
recognizing that the parents are the child’s best teacher, not us, not the
13:30
home-visitors or the staff, but just trying to empower them as parents to
13:35
use some of the tools that we have to just build on what they already know.
13:41
We also do an ASQ [ages and stages questionnaire], it’s
13:45
a developmental screening.
13:48
It is really a parent-based assessment tool.
13:51
It’s created so the parent can do it themselves, but with the families
13:56
that we have, the ASQ is only translated into Spanish and English.
14:01
And also recognizing even some of the families that can read
14:06
English, their literacy level is under a sixth-grade reading level.
14:12
Almost always we do that with the parent and the child.
14:17
We do this about twice a year in both programs, and just
14:22
monitoring the child’s development.
14:24
If we see some delays, we’ll discuss it with the parent and kind of work
14:28
on some of the skills that need to increase those delays, but if they are
14:31
significant delays, either development, social, or if there’s a speech delay,
14:36
then we refer them to early intervention for ongoing more-intensive services.
14:41
The API
14:45
community is very diverse, so how do you asses the needs of
14:51
the different community members?
14:53
Or is it very much on an individual basis?
14:55
Or do you see that with children that age that there are mostly similarities amongst
15:02
all of them in terms of what they need?
15:06
Probably the biggest--just across the board in all the API
15:11
communities, just from experience in working with the families in
15:16
these past years, it seems like the
15:22
biggest concerns that we have are probably social, emotional
15:26
development because families tend to just keep their children at home.
15:33
Learning their native language, they haven’t been emerged into
15:37
any English-social activities.
15:42
They go to church probably, or to a mosque, or to a temple, and they
15:46
hear their own language, so we really try to promote getting the child out
15:53
into the community, to playgroups, to a community center even, a
15:57
playground, to kind of develop those social skills.
16:03
Children also, we have found, have—they don’t learn a lot of the literacy skills,
16:14
so sometimes someone from the outside, for example, an EI or preschool teacher
16:19
might assess that child as being delayed, but it’s not that they’re delayed
16:24
because they will eventually, we have found, eventually they will catch up.
16:27
By the time they are three of four years old, they learn how to speak
16:30
English; all of a sudden it just happens.
16:34
As soon as they’re immersed in a social environment where they can
16:38
pick up on the language, they develop the language, they develop the social
16:42
skills, I mean, it’s just like it happens just like a shining star--instantly.
16:47
The
16:54
parents just, kind of--we just talked about this today in a staff meeting--if
17:01
parents were to choose between home-visits, which early-intervention
17:05
also provides, versus a playgroup or a preschool-like program where
17:12
they’re in a social, school-type setting, the parents would prefer that.
17:17
Almost 90% of the time the parents would prefer the social setting because
17:21
they really worry about--those are skills that children are going to learn
17:27
about by being around other children.
17:29
It’s not necessarily something that the parents can teach
17:31
them one-on-one in a home.
17:34
So, the academics, the word, the letter identification, everything
17:40
that they need to know, there’s around 80 skills that they need to know
17:44
before they hit kindergarten—to be kindergarten ready—most of those happen
17:48
between the ages of three and five.
17:50
They may not necessarily learn them before age three if they’re not immersed into a
17:57
social aspect of learning those things.
18:00
So our families are very, very isolated, lots of waiting lists
18:05
to get into preschool programs.
18:08
If they do get into a
18:11
program other than Head Start, they have to pay and they can’t afford to pay,
18:15
so you see a lot of the Asian Pacific Islander families staying home because
18:22
they just kind of, they don’t get into the loop or they don’t know about the
18:27
Head Starts or they don’t understand the American school-system is free
18:32
for everybody; they don’t understand that, they don’t know how to access it.
18:37
So that’s something we’ve been working on is figuring out how to break those
18:41
barriers of access so that all those Asian families can have equal opportunity
18:46
for the children to get into school.
18:51
Since young children are able to more-easily learn multiple languages,
18:59
while they’re still young as opposed to adults, do you and your programs
19:03
encourage that dual-language—so you encourage them to learn English but do
19:08
you also encourage them to maintain, perhaps, their first language as well?
19:12
Yes, yes, and we encourage them, first of all, to maintain their native
19:15
language because, you know, it’s the cultural aspect; and if they, the
19:21
children, forget their language or forget their culture, they may never
19:25
get another opportunity when they get older and they become immersed into
19:30
American culture they may forget that and then it’s really hard, I think,
19:34
to teach kids once they’ve forgotten it, how to come back to it again.
19:39
So we really stress on that.
19:40
And so many parents, they want their kids to learn English, and so we just
19:44
say, your kids will learn eventually once they go to school--not to really
19:49
stress on it too much at an early age.
19:53
But, they want to fit in, they want to be
19:56
like everybody else and they don’t want to be singled out, and they don’t want
19:59
their kids to, you know, be confused when they get to school because
20:04
they don’t understand their teacher, they don’t understand their peers.
20:07
But, they figure it out.
20:09
By the end of kindergarten, they’re ready.
20:14
So, in terms of the need in the community, do you see that over the years [it] has
20:21
continued to grow, has the population continued to increase, and have you
20:25
continued to expand your programs?
20:27
The population has continued to increase.
20:30
I mean, the specific ethnicity of what Asian or Asian Pacific Islander community
20:36
has greatly, like, changed over the years.
20:39
Many years ago, primary used to be Vietnamese, Mon, Lao, Mien,
20:44
and Cambodian—so the Southeast Asian--and some, some Chinese.
20:48
And in the last few years, a lot of the Nepalese, Bhutanese, and
20:54
Burmese communities have migrated to Portland, and, therefore, we
21:01
don’t necessarily have the staffing or the funding for interpreters.
21:06
So that’s really where we
21:10
try to use our resources from within, using other staff from
21:13
other programs, helping each other, both they help us and we help them.
21:22
It’s really sad because there’s not enough funding to hire, you
21:25
know, even a half-time person for each of the needed groups.
21:29
So it’s something that we voice our opinions to, to the funders, and
21:35
we, you know, need more funding.
21:37
But it’s just,
21:40
it’s sad, but we focus on the biggest population to try
21:45
to help the most families.
21:48
But then the families, the populations that are smaller get neglected even
21:53
though their need is just as strong.
21:56
Do you try and match someone who speaks a family’s native language
22:00
to that family when you can?
22:02
Yes, when we can.
22:04
And if not,
22:07
we don’t say “no” to the family, but just let them realize that, you know,
22:10
if you’re gonna join our program then we have to either speak English or we
22:16
have to have someone from the family help us interpret on home-visits.
22:21
And, for the most part, is that also--those language services, is
22:26
that something that you provide, or you refer them to other programs, or
22:31
how does that work in terms of the language barrier, if that’s the case?
22:37
So,
22:41
if there’s a language barrier, like I was saying, we try to get other programs to
22:47
help us, but there’s not really anywhere else in [the] Portland-metro area to refer
22:55
those families with young children to.
22:58
No other agency employs, like, Burmese or Nepalese home-visitors
23:04
with an early-childhood background.
23:08
So, it’s a huge need.
23:11
Definitely.
23:11
Yep.
23:14
So you’ve been involved with the Asian Family Center for 17 years, how did
23:20
you become involved with the AFC?
23:21
Were you recruited, did you seek it out as an organization,
23:24
did you like what they did?
23:25
I sought it out, yeah, I sought it out.
23:28
I just happened to be at the unemployment office looking for
23:31
a job back in the late 90s and
23:37
got a referral, went through the interview, and I was hired.
23:45
The story, so this is funny about the history, is that my last name back then,
23:49
when I got hired, was Kang [sp?] . And, as an Asian last name, most of the time,
23:55
you know, when you’re getting hired, you look at the application, and, if someone
23:59
doesn’t speak the language—they’re not bilingual, well, why are they applying?
24:03
So, I got the interview, I’m suspecting from my last name, but also because I
24:09
had that early childhood background.
24:12
And then through the interview process, just many of the questions were
24:16
related directly to both my cultural experience with the Asian community
24:23
and, also, just my educational background focusing on early childhood.
24:29
Really,
24:31
like I said, I sought it out and I got lucky.
24:34
I really wanted, though, to work at an agency that was working
24:39
with somewhat of what I had the experience and knowledge [of] that
24:43
I could give back to the community.
24:45
So that was really my passion.
24:47
I used to teach school, and I wanted to be still in that
24:50
realm of the teaching-aspect.
24:53
But I wanted to be more hands-on and see more direct-effects of people’s
24:59
lives and how they could change.
25:03
You mentioned you had some previous experience with the Asian Pacific
25:07
Islander Community specifically; can you talk a little bit about that?
25:09
Right, well, I was married before to a Cambodian.
25:13
Just being immersed into that culture, you know, with my personal experience,
25:19
it really helped me to understand how to approach families, and the “dos” and
25:24
the don’ts,” but, also, how to work with other staff from different cultures.
25:29
It helped me to understand a
25:33
lot about respect and the cultural traditions, the dress, the
25:39
clothing, the lifestyle, and how to approach and build good, positive
25:45
relationships with the staff as well.
25:47
So, it helped me a lot.
25:50
Wonderful.
25:51
So you’ve been here for over 15 years, so can you talk a little
25:56
bit about your feelings of AFC?
25:58
Obviously, you are passionate about the mission of AFC and
26:03
the work that you’re doing.
26:05
Can you talk a little bit about the overall organization and how you
26:08
see it in service of the community?
26:12
Okay, good question.
26:13
Um.
26:16
So working here for 17 years, I have seen a tremendous
26:21
growth at Asian Family Center.
26:24
And what I really value is that,
26:29
in almost everything
26:30
that we do, we try to seek community input about the gaps, the need,
26:38
what the services should look like, where should the services be.
26:44
So again, I see that we really try to focus on the strength-based kind of - an
26:50
American approach, but we still tie in the cultural aspect of what we do in getting
26:58
community leader input, getting people from the community to have a voice in
27:04
how we, kind of, develop our programing.
27:10
I think that has a lot to do with our expansion and how we’ve done.
27:14
Having the community support in what we do, and we’ve never really, I
27:20
don’t think we’ve ever lost that.
27:21
In fact, it’s just kind of grown.
27:23
That’s how I see the leadership programs - we have staff who were former clients who
27:29
became staff, and then became supervisors.
27:32
And so, they have their own little stories and history behind it, too,
27:35
and I think having all that and hiring from the community just embraces
27:41
that family aspect of what we do.
27:51
There’s always gonna be gaps in services because there’s never gonna be enough
27:54
money to meet the needs of the community.
27:57
But, I think that
28:02
working together with the community is what really makes, especially
28:07
a non-profit organization that is serving the community, work better.
28:14
Can you describe a little bit about that strength-based approach, that model?
28:18
Can you describe that, how that works, and perhaps give some examples?
28:24
Okay so, working from a strength-based approach is just looking at what is it
28:31
that’s already happening in the community, what can you do in your agency to build
28:38
on that so it becomes stronger; and so
28:45
you have more arms to wrap around and to, kind of, support what’s already happening.
28:52
That’s what I spoke about before--example: In our home-visiting programs where we
28:58
don’t go in and tell the family, “you’re doing this wrong; I think that you need
29:02
to do it this way.” We go in and we try to look at something that’s going well.
29:08
I’m a strong believer that if you look at what’s going well and you build on what’s
29:11
going well, you’re going to see more good, positive things. The negative things that
29:17
aren’t going so well kind of go away.
29:21
It’s kind of like when you’re talking to—I use this example with staff all
29:26
the time—if you’re--it’s a parallel process--if you’re talking about the
29:32
children who are having temper-tantrums and they’re just always acting up,
29:37
always acting up, if a parent is always saying, “don’t do this Johnny, don’t
29:42
do that, don’t do that,” slapping their hand, just ignoring them, but every
29:47
time they do something bad just keep on. But, if you go to a child and you
29:51
see a child picking up and putting their shoes away and you compliment them, “oh
29:55
nice job,” that child is going to want to do that more and more to get that
29:59
positive, I call, strength-based approach.
30:03
So that’s a strength-based approach to parenting.
30:06
If we can continue, and keep that example in mind, as home-visitors, I tell them to
30:13
look at what the parents are doing well.
30:15
Compliment the parent on what they’re doing well so that they continue
30:19
to do those things as a parent well so that that parent will be less
30:24
stressed and will be a better parent in taking care of their child.
30:29
I do that with my staff, so that’s the parallel process.
30:34
I compliment them on what they’re doing well; I try not to focus on
30:38
the negative things though sometimes you have to give constructive
30:41
criticism in everything that we do.
30:44
But if you’re looking at what they do well, focus on that, build on that.
30:49
So an example is: A staff comes to work on-time every day; maybe you
30:53
take them to coffee for appreciation for having such good attendance.
30:57
Or maybe their files are always organized; you, you know, let them
31:02
know that they’re doing a good job.
31:04
They’re going to keep doing that.
31:05
So that’s the parallel process in strength-based approach.
31:09
I do it to my staff, the staff does it to the parent, the parent does it to the
31:12
child; so it’s kind of a ripple-effect.
31:14
And, I tell staff this all the time.
31:17
So you can take that example, I think in everything that we do, in
31:22
every program at Asian Family Center.
31:24
If you focus on the positives, and you build on the positives, that
31:28
is the strength-based approach.
31:31
Wonderful.
31:33
So for your community assessment, and when you’re working with the many groups that
31:39
you work with, do you take part from the data and in the programs like the IRCO
31:45
needs assessment every few years, or do you have smaller, more-focused groups
31:51
specifically for families with children?
31:53
How does that work?
31:54
How does that play into the larger organization?
31:57
Good question.
31:59
So, really like every program, every one of our children’s programs has
32:05
outcomes, goals, and objectives that we need to meet--not always tied
32:11
directly to IRCO’s overall goals or Asian Family Center’s overall goals.
32:20
Example:
32:23
80% of the children will be on-target for development, and any child that’s not
32:29
on-target we refer to early-intervention.
32:31
Well, that doesn’t have anything really to do with the overall goals of IRCO,
32:37
but if you’re talking about a parent has shown increased knowledge, now that’s a
32:42
goal that I can see as directly related.
32:45
If a parent has increased knowledge of effective parenting skills by the time
32:51
they exit our program--almost 99.9% of the parents are going to say yes--so
32:59
really, we’re creating self-sufficiency which is IRCO’s overall goal.
33:03
Asian Family Center is to create identity in the community
33:10
and help to promote leaders.
33:14
I think that kind of thing is all related, but—can you say your
33:18
question one more time because I’m not sure I totally understand.
33:22
In terms of needs-assessment--so I know that IRCO as an organization has, every
33:28
few years, a really large, community needs-assessment where they’re working
33:32
with all the communities that they serve, not just the API community.
33:36
So, do you take part in that?
33:38
Do you take away from that research and data gathered or do you have your
33:43
own needs-assessment that you do?
33:44
I don’t specifically participate in the needs-assessment, its—for this last
33:50
year, we had the leaders in the community participate in the needs-assessment.
33:54
Some of IRCO’s
33:55
staff were a part of that by volunteering during the event.
33:59
But, I haven’t seen the write-up or the results of that needs-assessment yet.
34:06
If there is something directly related to, I think, a specific program that
34:10
comes up during that needs-assessment, then the manager is informed about that
34:16
and then brought into that conversation or that planning of how can our program
34:24
be [cognizant] of what that need was that was spoken in the need-assessment,
34:28
and how can we interweave that into what we do in our programs.
34:32
Definitely.
34:33
But, I haven’t really seen that
34:38
as it’s related to our programing in the parenting programs.
34:41
Right.
34:41
So that’s more of a big-picture, and then what you’re doing is more-specific
34:47
with these families, with API community.
34:49
Right.
34:49
I think that ours is just, like, the base, the stepping stone because we’re working
34:54
with the real little ones and the parents.
34:56
But I think that what we do does directly affect—because eventually
35:00
those parents will probably be, or some of them are, leaders in the community.
35:06
They will learn through our positive reinforcement, our
35:12
strength-based approach.
35:13
We’re working on building up the parents’ self-esteem, being proud
35:17
of who they are, what they’re doing as a parent, being a great parent,
35:21
and they’ll feel more empowered to participate in the other things in the
35:25
community such as going to the community needs-assessment or participating in
35:30
other Asian Family Center programing.
35:33
Then, it’s kind of like, you do that and then you create this ripple-effect and
35:36
they’re going to talk to their friends, or their family members, or their
35:39
community members to have more supports within the agency and the community.
35:46
That’s wonderful that you see yourself as the base in terms of early
35:50
development and education that then leads to leadership in the community
35:56
which is what you’re aiming for.
36:00
And so, what are some of your recommendations?
36:04
Perhaps not only for your program, but for AFC as a whole in terms of the needs.
36:10
Obviously, more funding and more staff would be great, and more people that
36:15
know more languages, so in addition to that, what role do you see playing—what
36:20
do you think your recommendations are?
36:24
Well there’s always a need for more-diverse staff.
36:27
But I think, like, I’ve talked about this before, the way that you’re
36:30
going to make that happen is to make that need known at the college level.
36:37
So many people at all these different colleges, whether a technical school,
36:41
or whether it’s, you know, a community college or university--letting them
36:49
know that there is such a huge need for social work-type positions within
36:57
the ethnic-specific communities.
37:00
If we can promote that somehow to get more people--even volunteer or,
37:08
you know, do an internship within our agencies--they can see that need.
37:13
And then, maybe finding a more-diverse workforce is definitely, I think,
37:18
the huge need that I see that there needs to be a change.
37:23
You’re background is in education, early childhood education and teaching,
37:28
are those the types of backgrounds and studies that you’re looking for?
37:33
What types of other skills do you think are needed in this type of work?
37:38
So definitely
37:41
there are more, how can I say—there are definitely more therapeutic
37:47
counsellors needed for children.
37:50
There’s not enough culture-specific counsellors out there that can
37:55
work with the diverse cultures that are coming to Portland.
38:00
So, there’s definitely a need for therapeutic counsellors, a need for
38:07
home-visitors, parent educators to be more diverse from the
38:11
different ethnic backgrounds.
38:15
Typically, they, I would say, they go to school for business—most API communities,
38:21
they go to school for business; they don’t look into the social service
38:25
field or working with young children.
38:29
So, they have the experience, the life experience, but they don’t have the
38:35
technical background or the education about child development, parenting
38:40
education, what to teach, how to teach it, the theory behind all that.
38:47
So I think that we could do more outreach or more…just like at PSU or different
38:57
schools within Portland, at least.
39:01
Can you talk a little bit about your personal and professional
39:06
achievements in terms of what you have felt have been your successes
39:11
here at AFC, I’m sure you have many.
39:13
So what do you think are some of
39:16
your proudest achievements in terms of programs or how you’ve helped staff or if
39:20
there are specific stories from families you’ve assisted that you’d like to share?
39:26
Hm.
39:27
That’s a good question.
39:31
Probably just my biggest achievement, I think, is how long I’ve been here.
39:36
Most people are just truly amazed to see a non-bilingual
39:41
person stay at IRCO this long.
39:44
You know, it’s just, most of the supervisors or managers of IRCO
39:52
are from the ethnic-specific communities; you don’t see many
39:55
Caucasian mainstream supervisors.
39:59
They come and they go, but not too many stay more than five years.
40:05
The pay--but it’s just it’s the passion, it’s not about the pay, it’s about what
40:10
you do and what you believe in, and, you know, that you can make a change.
40:16
I think my hugest,
40:21
I guess, success is teaching people what I know--just like the theories
40:27
and examples I’ve given you, passing that on to them and teaching them how
40:35
to be effective communicators both verbally and written and to teach
40:43
people how to be non-judgmental.
40:47
I think those are my hugest successes.
40:50
And just helping other people within IRCO; mentoring them around not so
41:00
much the business piece of what we do as supervisors or managers, but
41:05
about the human relationships and how that is way more important than how
41:12
you fill out a form or, you know, how you do your time-sheet, or whatever.
41:16
It’s really about those human relationships and how
41:18
you interact with people.
41:23
Teaching people how to be good listeners; everybody wants to tell their story,
41:27
but in order to be a good storyteller, I think, first,
41:30
you need to be a good listener.
41:33
So, I think, that’s kind of my motto and my way behind what I do; I try to
41:40
really listen to people first before I speak, and sometimes people get upset
41:45
with me because I’m so laid back and I take a long time to get my thoughts
41:49
out or I don’t respond right away, and it’s just because I want to really
41:56
think things through before I act.
41:58
Think before you speak.
42:03
As you described that you’re not bilingual and being a Caucasian woman
42:10
in an environment where most of the people that work here, as you mentioned,
42:15
are from the ethnic communities they’re representing, has that ever been an issue?
42:20
Or because AFC is very welcoming, they just value your
42:24
expertise and your knowledge and that’s what’s most important?
42:28
Yes, yes.
42:30
That’s it.
42:30
Wonderful.
42:31
Yeah.
42:34
In terms of the work here that you do and in your experience, can you talk a
42:40
little bit about your mentors or who has inspired you in the work that you do?
42:48
That can be outside of AFC or it can be your supervisors or
42:52
colleagues here that you work with.
42:55
So, my first inspiration was probably--everyone calls him Mr.
43:00
Hongsa, I can’t say his last name, but he was probably my first inspiration.
43:06
He took the time, he was a really good listener; he took the time to train me how
43:11
to do the role of a lead parent educator.
43:16
[He’s] very, very detail-orientated, and that’s how I became just like that.
43:22
[He’s] very organized and very compassionate.
43:27
He taught me all that in a very little time, but he took the time to teach me
43:31
and I think that’s what was important.
43:33
I knew that he’s a big, big leader in the Lao community; and from
43:40
Laos, he’s also a former king.
43:44
I really respected and I know how important that is
43:47
even though he’s not there.
43:49
People take that understanding of who he used to be, and they never forget that.
43:56
I think that’s, kind of--when I know about somebody’s history, if
44:01
it’s a good history, I try to never take those things for granted.
44:07
I was just truly amazed, like: here’s this Caucasian woman coming
44:10
to Asian Family Center and this big leader in the community took time
44:14
to teach me how to do this job.
44:17
Something maybe he saw in me that, you know, I could do this job,
44:21
or that I had the passion for it, or whatever it might’ve been.
44:26
He was my inspiration to, just, take one step at a time and anything can be
44:35
accomplished; it doesn’t matter who you are or where you came from or what you’re
44:39
doing right now, you can do anything.
44:43
Probably I would say my other inspirations, I would honestly say, is
44:47
just all of the supervisors that are under me: Pam Richardson, Chow Lance, Svetlana
44:52
Svachedah, and May Chow [sp?] . They have all been supervisors for more
44:59
than five years, each of them.
45:01
In our department, we’ve all been together, so they’re almost
45:04
like sisters, but they are the supervisors and I’m their manager.
45:11
But, they respect me, but I respect them.
45:15
They’ve really been my inspiration and my support system while I’ve been at IRCO.
45:21
We set professional boundaries, but, yet, we can all still be
45:25
sister-like to each other and I’ve really, really appreciated that.
45:28
I guess that’s why I’m still here; I would say it’s just because of that
45:34
support I’ve got from all of them.
45:37
And you mentioned that you took over Mr. Hongsa’s position, is that correct?
45:41
That he mentored you and trained you into the position?
45:45
Mm-hmm.
45:46
In your transitions and moving from being more of the worker that did most of the
45:56
home-visits and then moving up to manager and now you manage the supervisors, how
46:02
has that worked in terms of—basically, the changes that have happened, and over
46:09
yours of experience, have you moved up?
46:12
Do you apply?
46:13
I’m curious how that works and just the internal workings of IRCO.
46:16
Like how did that happen?
46:17
How did I go from direct-service to manager?
46:21
Mm-hmm.
46:22
Was that that the programs were expanding and then with your
46:24
expertise, you were moving up?
46:26
Yes.
46:26
It’s just, I think, keeping the Asian Pacific Islander PCDS program over
46:32
all these years—you know, it’s been up for a grant renewal and other agencies
46:38
could apply for the same funding
46:42
and the same programing.
46:45
I don’t know if others did, but we still applied for it every
46:47
time it came up for refunding.
46:48
But we were always the one granted back the API PCDS;
46:52
nobody else has ever had that.
46:55
Only us.
46:56
There’s a Slavic PCDS, there’s an African immigrant PCDS, and there
47:00
are regional PCDSs, and there Native American, African American also.
47:07
So we’ve always kept the API; the other ones have kind of come and gone.
47:13
I think building on the success of that specific program, I think,
47:17
has helped us to expand on the other programs that we have.
47:22
That’s wonderful.
47:23
And you mentioned that really AFC is the only agency that provides
47:31
the services in the way that you provide them, is that correct?
47:35
Well, I’m not sure the details of what the other culture-specific
47:39
agencies…how they adapt their program so that they are culture specific.
47:46
I can only speak for what I know
47:47
at AFC.
47:49
My sense is that every ethnic community-based organization
47:53
does things in their own way.
47:58
I would say we have the staff from those communities for which
48:02
the communities we serve, and I think that’s what makes us unique.
48:07
Even though, like we mentioned before, the funding, there’s a gap in funding
48:12
for the newer Asians that are coming to the United States; but, you can’t
48:18
always meet the needs of everybody.
48:20
You
48:23
know, we have a Mien and a Vietnamese-speaking home-visitor
48:28
in our Asian Pacific Islander PCDS.
48:31
Although there’s a need for many, many others, those are the ones that we have
48:35
that are trained in the curriculum who have the knowledge and the know-how
48:40
to help do the program effectively.
48:43
You can’t just change staffing because there’s another entity; what we need
48:50
to change is our funding sources.
48:52
So we still need more funding so we can hire additional people.
49:00
And that training, is that something that you and your staff provide?
49:06
When someone new comes in, they may come in with that early education
49:12
background and they may have that degree, but in terms of that
49:15
culturally-specific training, then do you provide that or is that something
49:18
that you have to learn as part of the process of working with families?
49:21
A lot of it is learning as you’re going.
49:24
Wow.
49:24
Yep.
49:24
And learning from other staff.
49:27
We have them—I have every new staff at least observe at least three different
49:32
home-visits from three different cultures.
49:35
They may never, you know, serve this specific culture over here, but I
49:41
want them to learn that they may run into that sometime down the road
49:45
while they’re in this department.
49:47
They may work another program, they may diversify the programing that
49:51
they’re working in; so it’s always good just to see another approach of
49:55
how things are done, and then you can adapt it, as you need it, for your
50:00
particular family that you’re serving.
50:02
So we do that.
50:05
And we also—we share stories among each other in our staff meetings.
50:11
We share food, we do—two times a year, we do annual get-togethers.
50:18
During December and then in June, we do a whole department get-together where we
50:24
share time, we do teambuilding activities.
50:26
So a lot of that also is from peer to peer learning.
50:31
Wonderful.
50:32
Do you find that that coupled with
50:37
the in-class academic experience is a really good way of enabling staff
50:43
members to serve their communities?
50:44
Right, I don’t think that you can just go to a training and listen to somebody talk
50:48
about a specific culture and say, “oh, now, I’ve gotten diversity training,”- no.
50:53
I really
50:54
think the diversity training happens from life experience and being immersed
50:59
into a particular situation at a time, and learning how to maneuver
51:04
your situation or figure it out.
51:05
And we learn from our mistakes, and you adapt.
51:10
And, I think that our staff also go to each other on how to deal with a
51:15
certain thing; whether it is, you know, you have a child with a temper-tantrum
51:21
who is a Pacific Islander child, or you have a child who’s Chinese and
51:26
they have a different type of way of dealing with that temper-tantrum.
51:29
Well, maybe, you know, I might be Chinese and I don’t know how to deal with my
51:35
family over here because I don’t know anything, even though I’m Asian, I don’t
51:38
know how, if it’s the same as my culture.
51:41
So I always tell them: “don’t ever assume that you know how to deal with
51:44
a situation; it’s better to go talk with another staff or someone from the
51:48
community that--maybe, try to figure out how you’re gonna resolve that situation
51:52
before you make a wrong judgment.”
51:56
Excellent.
51:57
How do you feel--you may not feel comfortable speaking for your
52:00
staff, but how do you feel that
52:04
your staff have been able to adapt and work with the different communities?
52:09
Is that something that you, as a manager, have seen their growth?
52:13
Is that something that you look for as one of your goals as manager?
52:18
I don’t know.
52:18
I think I’m just very, very fortunate.
52:20
The staff that we have had,
52:24
none of them have ever said, or came to me to say, “I feel uncomfortable
52:29
working with this culture-specific community.” They’re all just very
52:33
passionate about what they do.
52:38
Nobody has ever left our programing because of, you know, they felt
52:42
uncomfortable working with a specific culture. I can’t say that there are any
52:53
negative things to say about the staff and their relationships
52:56
with different cultures.
52:59
That’s wonderful that you have such great staff and that you’re able
53:03
to have that peer to peer exchange of knowledge and experiences.
53:09
That’s great.
53:11
So is there anything else that we haven’t discussed?
53:13
Any programs that we’ve missed that you’d like to share more about?
53:17
Or any topics that come to mind?
53:26
You know, in our department we probably have 13 different programs.
53:31
Some are sited here, some at Africa House, some at IRCO.
53:32
Some of the staff that are
53:34
in the API
53:37
PCDS program though, they also work in some of our DHS foster care prevention
53:42
programing so they kind of do both so they get some experiences in
53:48
working with high-risk families also.
53:50
They kind of—they’ve learned to be adaptable and flexible, and, like I
53:57
said, not only in the ethnic cultures that they serve, but in the needs
54:03
of those cultures; they’ve been able to be flexible in working with both
54:08
low-risk and high-risk families.
54:14
That’s great.
54:14
And so, do you see the program just continue to expand?
54:19
Do you see potentially more programs?
54:25
If there are funds available, then yes.
54:27
If there are funds, I see definitely like building upon the ability to
54:30
serve more communities, definitely.
54:34
I wouldn’t change the way that we’re doing things or the approach that we
54:39
take in working with families; I just say we need to be able to provide
54:44
more families with more services.
54:47
Yeah.
54:49
Wonderful.
54:50
And then you can continue to be that base, that foundation for the rest of
54:56
AFC, for the rest of the organization.
54:57
Absolutely, absolutely.
54:58
We see our families, kind of, trickle through other programs and get ongoing
55:03
support services as their children grow.
55:07
That’s wonderful.
55:09
Alright, anything else for closing, any closing remarks?
55:13
No, thank you very much.
55:15
Alright, thank you.
55:16
Okay.
55:16
Interview paused and restarted.
55:20
Okay, as a quick success story, could you share one if you have one?
55:23
Sure.
55:24
So I was working in our DHS IHSRS program, it’s called In-Home Safety
55:29
Reunification Service, and it is a program funded through DHS child welfare
55:34
in district two in Multnomah County.
55:37
I got a referral for a Filipino, single mom with two children, one was
55:44
two years old and one was newborn.
55:47
She was living in a shelter about 45 miles from Portland and no other agency
55:54
wanted to travel to provide the services.
55:56
So, she needed a non-offending parenting curriculum delivered to her.
56:06
And so I piloted a curriculum through modification--every home-visit modified
56:13
it based on what was going on with her.
56:16
I travelled past Woodburn once a week for three hours for 12
56:22
weeks and provided supports to her, delivering this curriculum.
56:31
She finally realized, you know, over time,
56:38
the reason that child welfare opened her case was that her former husband
56:45
of her kid was a sex-offender and he was charged with that.
56:52
He went through his treatment but he never finished.
56:56
So, when she had her baby in the hospital here in Portland, of course,
57:02
due to his actions in the hospital,—he was a little violent, yelling at the
57:06
nurses and the doctors, “why this? why that?”—DHS got involved in that case.
57:14
Then they found out that he had never finished his treatment, so it was a
57:17
safety risk now for mom and the kids.
57:23
They made a safety plan with her; put her in a shelter.
57:28
So I had to go to the shelter to visit her every week.
57:33
It was very successful at the end; she really, kind of,
57:35
finally took the information in.
57:40
In the beginning she was a little resistant, “my husband would
57:44
never do this; this was in his past.” But, he never had finished.
57:48
What she couldn’t understand is he never finished his
57:50
treatment, so he was never fully
57:56
finished with his therapy which meant he probably could reoffend again, and that
58:02
was DHS’ concern--he could reoffend to the children that they now have together.
58:08
She finally got the concept that maybe that could happen.
58:12
So now, she had a set of tools, she had many handouts that she could refer back
58:17
to in case something happened, she could say, “yes, this is what Danita taught,
58:22
I remember this, I gotta be strong, I gotta protect my kids.” So she had
58:27
a plan in place, she had a curriculum in place, she had the information to
58:32
build on her strengths and to let her make decisions around choices that she
58:39
needed to make to keep her kids safe.
58:41
In the end, she wanted to move back to California, so the shelter bought her a
58:46
ticket—a one-way ticket to California.
58:49
And I went and got her at 3 o’clock in the morning and picked her up from the
58:52
shelter, took her to the airport, got her in the airport, got her checked
58:57
in, and then she was on her way.
58:59
She called back about 3 weeks later from a blocked number, but
59:03
just, you know, “Danita, I’m fine.
59:04
I want to let you know, I appreciate everything that you did, and me and
59:09
my kids are gonna be fine now.” So it was just really, really, like, even
59:13
talking about it gives me goose-bumps because I know that she may have been
59:18
okay later in life, but now I know she is going to be okay later in life.
59:21
If he ever comes back to her life, she’ll have the tools of knowing how to deal
59:26
with the situation, and knowing that yeah, maybe she will take him back, but
59:31
maybe she can also say, “you know what, I want you to finish your treatment, so
59:35
that I really, really know that me and my kids are gonna be safe around you.”
59:40
Wow, that’s a wonderful success story.
59:42
Thank you so much for sharing.
59:43
Yeah.
59:43
You’re welcome.
59:44
Alright, thanks.
