00:05
My name is Natalia Fernández and I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian
00:10
at Oregon State University’s Special Collections and Archives Research Center,
00:14
the Oregon Multicultural Archives.
00:16
Today’s date is September 11, 2014 and we are at the Asian Family Center,
00:22
and we’ll go ahead and get started.
00:24
So, if you could please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:27
My name is
00:30
Sophorn Cheang.
00:34
It’s spelled S-O-P-H-O-R-N and my last name C-H-E-A-N-G.
00:42
Great.
00:42
And what is your birthdate and your birthplace?
00:46
I was born in Cambodia in the capital city on October 16, 1980.
00:55
And do you consider yourself Cambodian when someone asks you
00:58
your ethnic or racial background?
00:59
Is that what you respond?
01:01
Cambodian?
01:01
Yes.
01:01
Yes, Cambodian-American.
01:03
Cambodian-American.
01:05
And when and where were your parents born?
01:08
Both of my parents were born in Cambodia, too.
01:11
My mom came from the capital city and my dad came from the countryside.
01:17
But they both were born—came from Cambodia.
01:20
And so, you grew up in Cambodia when you were little and through
01:24
junior high and high school?
01:26
Yes, I actually grew up in Cambodia until I was nineteen.
01:31
I moved here to Oregon when I was nineteen.
01:34
And why did you decide to move to Oregon?
01:37
I first came here, actually came for school.
01:39
I came for college.
01:40
I have family here; my aunt and uncle who are here were here during that time.
01:46
They just came—moved from Chicago, so they stayed at Oregon, they
01:51
wanted to move to the west coast, and my dad wanted me to come to
01:57
the state to continue my education.
02:02
During that time I already received my associate degree in banking.
02:07
I graduated when I was sixteen from high school, so my dad said maybe you look
02:12
into opportunities to go and pursue your education and live with your uncle here.
02:19
So, my uncle and my aunt sponsor me and help me get into school
02:23
here, so that’s when I moved here.
02:27
So, to Portland, your uncle and aunt lived in Portland?
02:29
Yeah, they live in Gresham, in particular.
02:32
So, I went to Mount Hood first, Mount Hood Community College and transferred
02:37
to Portland State University afterward.
02:39
And what did you study?
02:41
Finance, business.
02:44
So, when you came here to study that, did you have anything in mind in terms
02:48
of what career you were interested in?
02:50
I wanted to be a CPA.
02:52
So, I wanted to be in accounting.
02:54
My dad thought that it would even though I had a degree in banking and
03:00
I was selected to work at the National Bank of Cambodia before I came here.
03:06
I already passed the exam.
03:08
It was a three-round exam.
03:10
There was like three, four hundred people and they only selected ten,
03:14
and I was the second one on the list.
03:17
So, I was so happy.
03:19
I thought that banking was kind of my career, but when my dad asked me what
03:25
did I want to do in banking, I said like maybe I want to be an accountant
03:31
because it’s easy to find a job anywhere, always is looking for accounting degree,
03:38
and eventually wanted to become a CPA.
03:42
But then, when I went to Portland State, in my junior year I
03:47
decided it’s not really my thing.
03:51
I wanted to know more of like—I wanted to become a financial analyst.
03:56
I wanted to do more of like in depth analyzing things and the stock,
04:03
like the market, so I decided to switch and graduated in finance.
04:10
So, accounting is my, kind of always my base.
04:15
And so you decided to stay here in Portland?
04:18
Yes.
04:18
I decided to stay here in Portland at—just right before I graduated.
04:24
And then I met my husband, we were together for a while and
04:28
then we decided to get married just right before I graduated.
04:36
Great.
04:37
And so, how did you get involved with the Asian Family Center?
04:42
So, I got involved with the Asian Family Center through the
04:48
Cambodian-American Community of Oregon.
04:51
When I went to Portland State, getting closer to my graduation, then they
04:59
say that let’s get more with the Cambodian-American Community of Oregon
05:03
through the Cambodian- American Community of Oregon, they are so involved with IRCO.
05:10
Actually, I know IRCO first before Asian Family Center.
05:14
So, because the executive director, he’s also Cambodian and
05:20
he’s very actively involved with the Cambodian community here.
05:23
There’s everybody known him and he’s just really respectable, you know,
05:30
being respected in the community.
05:33
So, I say well I wanted to learn more about the—kind of what the
05:37
immigrants and refugees here.
05:40
I volunteered here and there on any kind of activities that IRCO had,
05:48
and through the involvement with the Cambodian-American Community of
05:51
Oregon I started to get to know some of the programs here within IRCO
05:56
and also the Asian Family Center.
06:00
Then one of the programmers,
06:05
the civic engagement, which is the leadership; the diversity and civic
06:08
leadership engagement activity - so I
06:14
was a part of the class or the ENGAGE class back in 2010 and 2011,
06:25
so I learned, I kind of getting myself to learn more.
06:30
Then, after that my—a good friend, he’s kind of one of my mentors
06:36
too, in the community, he was a board member, an advisory board
06:41
member for the Asian Family Center.
06:45
Then he said that he didn’t really want to do it anymore because of his time.
06:50
He wanted to spend more time with the family.
06:54
They’re looking for someone who’s from the Cambodian community
06:59
to come and join the board.
07:01
It took me a while, then I decided to apply and joined the
07:06
advisory board in around, I think, the end of 2010, early 2011.
07:13
And then you’ve been on the board ever since?
07:16
I’ve been on the board—yes, and then around two-thousand—so, I
07:23
joined around 2010, the end of 2010, I believe, and when it’s around
07:23
two-thousand—the end of two-thousand or middle of 2012, I was selected to
07:38
be the chair of the advisory board.
07:42
Then I resigned at the end of last year, kind of early this year, because of
07:50
my interest to do more in a non-profit and there was an opportunity during
07:57
that time to come to do more on the operating side, so I wanted to join the
08:04
Asian Family Center, so that’s where I’m on IRCO on the operation side.
08:09
Okay.
08:11
So, let’s talk a little about your involvement with
08:15
ENGAGE, with that program.
08:17
Can you explain a little about how you applied and what you did for
08:20
that and what you learned from that?
08:22
Okay.
08:23
So,
08:25
I think in a way, right now that’s easy because now I’m turning to be like
08:31
managing that program, but when I really first heard about that it was in 2008.
08:38
That’s really when we—just a year or two after IRCO/Asian Family Center,
08:45
became one of the partners with the Office of Neighborhood Involvement.
08:50
And so, the goal of this Diversity and Civic Leadership involvement here,
08:58
for within the city of Portland, they work with the organizations like IRCO,
09:03
they actually have five partners.
09:05
IRCO is one of them.
09:07
They want to getting people to do more of like the civic engagement - to
09:13
be informed, to get awards, to be part of the—being the voice
09:18
from their prospective community.
09:21
So, the recruitment is every year and when I first heard that, it was
09:27
early in 2008, because my husband, back then my husband was the board
09:34
chair for the Cambodian-American Community of Oregon, so he was really
09:39
actively involved with the community.
09:43
Then he joined it, kind of like the first graduate from 2008.
09:50
So, through many years then I applied.
09:55
So, what happened is they said “okay, this is the classes.”
09:59
They have all the workshops.
10:01
I think—I believe in 2011, this is all the workshops that you come to attend.
10:07
They’re advocacy workshops, community organizing and the—I don’t remember
10:17
all of the things—but there’s classes and all the workshops back then.
10:23
So,
10:25
not just me, then there’s going through their selection, I believe during
10:30
that time it’s only thirty people coming from the African immigrant
10:34
community, from the Slavic community and also the Asians Pacific Islander.
10:39
I
10:42
remember my class and during that time in the Engage 2011 there were
10:48
a couple people were newcomers too, from the Zomi, from Burma.
10:54
So, it’s a, the involvement is to empower our community leaders to take
11:02
more on of the leadership role as well as becoming like, again like becoming
11:11
the part of the decision makers.
11:14
So, one thing that I recently learned is they call the river model, so
11:20
there’s the upstream, the middle stream and the downstream, and often
11:26
times, especially the immigrants and refugees who come here, languages
11:32
is one of the challenges for them.
11:35
They always, from time to time, just having the language barrier
11:38
and depends a lot to their own community or their children.
11:43
So,
11:46
to kind of preserve the culture and also empower them to speak up on their—on the
11:52
behalf of their own community, we would like to see more of the community leaders
11:57
be more into the upstream, so sitting at a table or talking to the decision maker
12:05
and say, “this is what’s going on, this is the need in my community.” And also it
12:10
is very important, like just for example for us as a community based organization,
12:15
we feel that just to sit down and listen to them, to hear like what their needs
12:21
are, it really helps us to make sure we provide the culturally specific services
12:30
to the right ethnic group; to the right community—see where they’re coming from.
12:37
So, they see they can preserve the cultures that they have.
12:43
Wonderful.
12:44
Do you keep in touch with the members of your cohort, the ones
12:48
that went to the program with you?
12:49
Is that common, to remain that rela—to retain that relationship with them?
12:55
We didn’t really have, for our ENGAGE we didn’t really have the alumni or the
13:00
senior cohort kind of system set up yet.
13:06
But it’s kind of part of the wish and the plans for the next upcoming like
13:10
two or three years, to see how we can get them to come back together anymore.
13:16
However, from time to time, this is just the same, kind of like you know,
13:20
many of them coming the same people as a community leader, so we tend to
13:24
run into each other at various events, community events, things like that.
13:31
Great.
13:31
Well, let’s talk a little about your time as a board member.
13:36
Can you share maybe some of your achievements as a board member?
13:42
The things that you did that you’re especially proud of during your tenure
13:46
as a board member and as a chair?
13:48
Ten years?
13:49
Did I say ten years?
13:50
No, your time that you served.
13:52
Oh, okay, thank you.
13:55
I feel that one of them is working with all the other boards, the experience
14:02
that they have sitting at the table with all the boards, all the advisory
14:05
board members, who is the leaders from their own community, who’s been the
14:13
advisors to their agency and supporting the programs that Asian Family Center
14:21
is working on in specific, and I recall that they experience is remarkable.
14:29
And during two-thousand,
14:33
I would say like 2013, was it last year, that when we had, together
14:40
with the board and staff, we put together a fundraising event.
14:44
Normally the Asian Family Center,
14:49
we had the Asian Cultural Night, and—but for the last couple years we didn’t.
14:56
We skipped a couple years because of the moving.
15:00
Because they just moved here several—a few years ago, actually,
15:04
from the old building to here.
15:06
So, part of having the capital campaign—and we worked together, the
15:12
advisory board worked together with staff, putting together that event.
15:18
And I don’t recall exactly how much, the numbers that we raised, but compared
15:22
to other years that normally it’s a celebration, this year I believe that we,
15:28
during that year, in 2013, we raised over ten thousand dollars, to contribute to the
15:37
capital campaign to have this building.
15:42
Wonderful.
15:43
Were you a part of the process of the move and the decision
15:47
to come to a new building?
15:51
Part of the advisory board role, it
15:55
is to help guide, so it’s not—I think the decision is more of like
16:02
the governing board.
16:03
Our IRCO governing board is the one who decides that, and most
16:06
importantly is our executive director.
16:10
Under his leadership I feel that I trust and strongly support his
16:16
leadership, and he’s the one who’s also recommend and suggest to us to invest
16:22
into the building rather than rent.
16:27
That request a suggestions being brought up by our Asian Family Center director,
16:34
and he’s also the associate director, Mr. Lee Po Cha, so he brought it up to
16:41
the advisory board, the Asian Family advisory board, to share that to.
16:46
We talk about it and so some of us came to check out the building to
16:50
see during that time, and in a way that make a recommendation that is a
16:58
good decision, to able to invest in something like this for the agency.
17:06
So, what is your current role with the Asian Family Center?
17:10
Your current title and your position?
17:12
Okay, so my current role right now is the community health and
17:17
leadership development manager.
17:19
I mean particularly, for the community health department that so many other
17:25
programs are kind of falling under - the community health, including the leadership
17:30
development and community development.
17:32
Even though the community development right now, the structure actually
17:37
changed a little bit from the kind of IRCO organizational structure,
17:42
that community health have come under the community development.
17:47
So, however, we kind of shared that leadership through the
17:52
main IRCO and Africa House.
17:56
You’ve heard about our other place, Africa House, right?
17:59
Yes.
17:59
Okay.
18:00
So, what are your job duties?
18:01
What are the types of things that you do?
18:04
There’s so many meetings.
18:08
That’s one thing.
18:09
But, my kind of role, I think, is set to oversee all the programs
18:16
and to work closely with our health programs coordinators, our with
18:26
leaders, our leadership development coordinator to make sure that we deliver
18:31
and we meet the goals and objectives for each program that we’re working on.
18:38
And one other thing too, and is most important, to manage the budget
18:44
within all of the programs; make sure that all of our activities and
18:49
programs stay within the budget.
18:51
So, in terms of community health programs and services, can you talk
18:55
a little bit about the types of services and types of programs that
18:59
you oversee, that AFC provides?
19:01
One of the big kind of, I would say that the health programs that we—we’re
19:08
very fortunate to receive the grant from the Cover Oregon and also from the OHA,
19:14
Oregon Health Authority, through the Cover Oregon outreach and involvement.
19:20
So, from seeing last year and then this year to help the population,
19:26
especially for the immigrants and refugee community, to educate them about the
19:34
coverage, to have insurance and why it’s so important to have coverage,
19:40
and also to improve the understanding of the preventive care and wellness,
19:49
compared to going to the emergency.
19:52
On top of that, we have our staff, our team here, help those communities,
20:00
like the community we serve, to help them and grow into the program,
20:04
receive the health insurance.
20:06
From counting last year, we have over seven hundred families and
20:12
we’re very fortunate to receive to continue
20:17
that program until early next year, to continue for the next enrollment.
20:23
On top of that, we go after—we send five of staff who are from here, Asian
20:33
Family—from actually not just in the Asian Family Center but also from IRCO to be
20:38
a certified community health worker, and right now two of them are on the program.
20:45
So, the part of the community health worker is to have—to work closely with
20:51
the community member, to help them to navigate too, because I mean, you know
20:57
through all of this, especially when it comes to the health topic, people
21:03
feel that they only want to talk to
21:08
someone who they can trust, so this part of kind of what we’re asking for
21:13
role as a community health worker.
21:16
And just we’re doing a little bit of, more of like the community
21:22
education and outreach, like this month we’re putting together three
21:28
Hepatitis B screenings, working together with the Providence Centers.
21:34
So, at Providence we’re working with the team there to see the [?] cancer
21:40
center, to kind of help how to educate, to put a workshop together and invite
21:49
the community from different communities.
21:52
We’re going to have from this African community and also the Burmese community,
21:57
to educate them and see why it’s so important for them to get screening.
22:04
So, that’s just kind of briefly from some of the health programs that we have.
22:09
Yes.
22:10
And so you mentioned partnerships and grants.
22:12
Does most of your work, especially the health programs, is that through
22:17
partnerships and grants through Multnomah County or on the state level, or both?
22:22
Does it just depend?
22:24
I would say that it depends.
22:27
Like if—for the Cover Oregon in particular, it’s the state
22:32
level is where we receive from.
22:35
But most, like most of the time we depend on the grants and the partnership.
22:38
Great.
22:42
So, how about talking a little about the programs and services
22:46
in terms of the leadership role?
22:48
So, you mentioned that you took part in the engage program
22:52
and now you‘re managing it.
22:55
So, how was that transition?
22:56
Was it helpful, do you think, that you took part in the program
23:00
and now you’re managing it?
23:01
You’ll get to see it from both sides?
23:03
I think it’s very, very interesting and it’s always good.
23:09
The managers, Dr. Pei-ru Wang, who during that time was the manager
23:14
for the program, I—that’s how I got to know her, through that too.
23:21
I learned so much from her.
23:23
She’s—she’s just amazing and very valuable to the agency and she - just
23:30
her knowledge.
23:31
You know, when it comes to the training and workshops.
23:36
I can see that we’re getting into like over the seven years, within the
23:41
diversity and civic leadership program, so we’ve been working together with
23:47
the Office of Neighborhood Involvement, with also the DCL, the Diversity and
23:52
Civic Leadership, our partner, to look into what’s our vision and in the next
23:58
two years, four years, and seven years.
24:01
I do enjoy the opportunity to be on the board to learn from the
24:08
management side, kind of like be the one who’s thinking ahead.
24:12
Mr. Lee Po Cha has been a great mentor.
24:16
He’s one of the persons who kind of started be part of—and see—had
24:22
that programs in the beginning.
24:25
So, he’s very knowledgeable when it comes to the programs and
24:29
the design and the work scope.
24:31
So, our vision here is taking on to see how can we—we work together to
24:39
get our community leaders to be more
24:44
engaged, to take on the leadership role within the city of Portland,
24:50
to grab any kind of opportunity to come to be more active at the council
24:59
meeting, to be at the budget hearing, to start talking more about what
25:04
the needs are within the community.
25:07
So, I feel that this is a great timing, that now; you know we just
25:13
recently, over a week ago, went to the retreat with the other partners.
25:20
We received a grant from the Office of Neighborhood Involvement to
25:25
have this conversations; what’s our vision for the next years.
25:31
And so, is that the main leadership training program, or do you have
25:36
other programs that you provide?
25:37
We do have other programs on top of that.
25:40
So, one of the other programs is the Asian Pacific Islander leadership
25:42
program, but I think the name of it we call the Asian Pacific Islanders
25:55
Community Leadership Institute.
25:59
So, that’s the whole title of the name.
26:02
The program is one of the six leadership programs under the CCC.
26:08
CCC is the Coalition of Communities of Color.
26:12
We received the funding from the Meyer Memorial Trust.
26:18
So, through this programs, what we focus on is two big components; is building
26:24
a pipeline and connecting the pipeline.
26:26
So, for the API Leadership Program, building the pipeline, what’s unique
26:34
about it that I found out, that’s how the program has been designed, and this is
26:39
our third year; it’s to provide more of like the culturally specific, but when it
26:45
comes to the API Leadership Program, we feel that it’s more of like a multi—you
26:52
know, because it’s not really just one culture, because there are so many like
27:00
from the API community, I believe there’s around forty languages, and so for
27:07
the last two years, we all did graduate two leadership fellows.
27:12
Two years of leadership, you know, of the program here.
27:17
So, the first year there were twenty-two graduates, the
27:19
second year fifteen graduates.
27:23
They shared like sixteen—they came from sixteen different ethnic
27:28
backgrounds, from the API group.
27:32
So, our program, what we do as a program model, as building the
27:39
pipeline, is resuming the training, through the popular education.
27:45
So, which means that they will have—they had opportunity to take, to have a
27:52
hands-on experience, to co-design or design and facilitate their own
28:00
workshop; to pick the topic, research, analyze, and then put together the
28:06
workshop, facilitate it and share it in
28:10
their cohort.
28:11
It is a cohort kind of activity program, and it was a very
28:16
intense six-month program.
28:18
So, it’s only for six months.
28:20
On top of coming to the workshop and learn for the popular education, they also
28:28
took on the community—we call community action projects—and mentorship program.
28:36
So, those two we, the IRCO Asian Family Center, is in partnership
28:42
with the APANO, the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon.
28:51
So, they put together, they do one leader community action projects that
28:58
is time that our leadership fellows had an opportunity to work on some of the
29:06
activities, some of the projects that involve taking on some leadership role
29:12
like doing more, connecting with the two-on-one info, how to do data research,
29:20
work at the Jade District, being a part of the council, be a part of the committee,
29:27
and one of the successful, kind of area, one of the cohort, she is an attorney.
29:38
So, she worked together with Oregon Law Center and put together a free legal
29:42
clinic to the underserved community.
29:46
It’s been going on for over a year already.
29:49
It’s every month for two hours.
29:52
She worked to find a
29:59
pro-bono attorney to help give the free legal consultant to the clients, and
30:03
we’ve been hosting that every month here.
30:07
Before it used to be rotated between the main IRCO, Africa House and
30:13
Asian Family Center, but now we try to keep it just within the Asian
30:18
Family Center, so to make it easy for
30:25
the attorney to kind of just come for one place.
30:27
Mentorship programs, we match with APANO, IRCO, and Asian Family Center and
30:37
with our cohort, identify what kind of area of interest that our cohorts have.
30:45
So
30:48
they, each one of them, was matched with a mentor, to work together
30:53
through that six months of the program, who they can talk to about
30:59
whatever is their career interest.
31:01
But, there are so many of them who didn’t really have that opportunity
31:07
to have someone who they can look up to, or had opportunity to have
31:09
someone who they can look up to, or have the opportunity to seek one on
31:15
one with someone who’s sitting at a state level or sitting at an office
31:18
with the governor or sitting at the big advisory board, or the board.
31:23
So, they can have the opportunity to ask those kind of questions.
31:28
For the next coming year, we just went through the selection for the
31:32
third year, so the next, the third
31:36
year cohort is going, they are starting next month, by the kick-off,
31:41
is going to be on October fourth and fifth, and we selected twenty-two.
31:46
It was very hard, because over—a couple months ago, we received forty-four
31:53
applications, and we were able to select twenty two, because of the capacity
31:57
that we have because of the funding.
31:57
So, it was
32:04
really hard for the steering committee.
32:06
The program has a steering committee who helps guide the project, who
32:13
advise and help support the program.
32:17
So, it seemed to be a lot, because there’s a lot of commitment
32:22
we ask from the fellows.
32:24
The bottom line is, like I mentioned earlier, is to connect to the pipeline.
32:28
We want to see; now again from the API community here, to be a part of like—this
32:38
is a state-wide program, by the way, so we had many people coming from Eugene too.
32:44
So, every year there’s one or two coming from Eugene, from Salem, from Springfield,
32:50
like this year there’s going to be
32:54
two from Eugene, one Springfield and from Salem.
32:59
So, we have everyone coming all over, trying to recruit to have
33:03
involvement from all over the state.
33:06
So then, is the goal that the work that comes out of the institute will then
33:13
continue in their local communities?
33:16
Like the attorney that is now providing that service every month, that’s the
33:20
idea, that they’ll develop something and then take it back to their community
33:23
and continue providing the service?
33:25
That is one thing.
33:27
That is one thing of, like, building the pipeline, for them to go back
33:30
and either they decide to continue to utilize the model of the program
33:36
through the popular education; another thing, that to help empower
33:43
and strengthen their own community.
33:46
Another thing is we like to see them taking on more of, again,
33:51
like, the civic engagement that is a higher level in a state wide.
33:56
One of our graduates whose—actually
34:02
she’s Pacific Islander—she just recently graduated in 2014 here.
34:10
She teaches at a public school--will be moving to public
34:14
school in Keizer near Salem.
34:18
And she was just recently appointed to be on the board for the Oregon,
34:24
you know, the Asian Pacific Islander’s affair, appointed by the governor
34:31
to serve for the next few years.
34:33
This is just one of the examples that we wanted to see as a part
34:36
of connecting the pipeline.
34:39
Through the process, in the next year here, we hope to continue to connect
34:47
the fellows, the community leaders with the board and the commission.
34:53
So, they, perhaps, can start by shadowing someone whose already
34:57
sat at a board and commission.
34:58
Believe it or not, just for the last couple years--and I meet with our
35:04
community leaders, recently, our last graduate here—there was 15 of them,
35:10
not all the 15 came to graduate.
35:13
I believe it was 12 came to the graduate.
35:18
More than half say that they’ve never been to the city hall.
35:23
So, that’s just a part of like, how, for them to kind of come out to take on, say
35:32
that, you know, the--not trying to get them to involve in politics, but in a
35:37
way of like they kind of know which areas that they need to share their voice, they
35:44
need to share their concerns, the issue that they have within their own community.
35:51
So, we, here, hope
35:52
that, ultimately, we’ll connect them to be a part of, again,
35:59
sitting at the big table.
36:02
Be the one who is able to let
36:05
the decision-makers know to be aware of the data, of the
36:10
populations, and their culture.
36:14
Make sure that we continue to provide a culturally-specific
36:18
program to the community.
36:21
Especially, what are the needs, again, the needs and the
36:25
services—we wouldn’t really know.
36:28
I’m sure that many of our decision-makers will not even know what really,
36:33
exactly, that community needs.
36:37
So, we make sure to provide the right service to them.
36:43
Wonderful.
36:44
Are there any other programs that you’d like to talk about?
36:46
Well, I talked a lot—I think so far, I’ve talked about, also, about the
36:51
API community leadership program.
36:53
Under my department--the Slavic leadership program is also under, you know, the
36:59
community health department as well.
37:02
Similar to the leadership, the API leadership program, they also
37:06
went through the cohorts program.
37:09
There are some similar routines, but they don’t use the popular education.
37:13
Just to make sure—because they want to make sure they
37:18
provide the right, kind of, culturally specific services
37:23
or program.
37:24
So, the program design more for what fits into the Slavic community.
37:31
One of the unique parts about that program is they conduct most of their
37:36
workshop in Russian, in their language.
37:40
Wonderful.
37:41
Yeah.
37:41
And, it is to also keeping their culture; and also many of their community
37:48
leaders they can do an outreach.
37:51
Because of the language barrier, sometimes it stops them from taking
37:57
on, you know, any kind of action.
38:00
One thing about the Slavic community too, when it comes to the
38:05
government side and community side, there is a big wall and barriers.
38:08
So, you know, it is very important for us to be a part of, like,
38:13
helping to lower that wall down; see how they can come together and
38:17
not to shy away from the government.
38:20
There are so many things that they could be a part with
38:31
and share with, share with the government.
38:32
So, that is kind of, so far, kind of, most of the main programs that
38:34
we have under the community health.
38:36
We do have, you know, a couple of other small civic engagement
38:41
and, kind of, working with the DHS on the child welfare issues.
38:46
So those are just the small grants.
38:51
Some
38:53
of our grants to our programs, sometimes it goes across departments; so, often
39:00
times, we are reaching out to the youth department, we are reaching out
39:05
to the parenting department to get their advice, to connect with them
39:09
and see how we can work together.
39:11
Can you talk a little bit about how you connect to communities?
39:18
Do you go out to local association meetings?
39:24
Do you set up opportunities for gatherings?
39:28
How do you connect with the community, because that can seem so simple but
39:32
be quite difficult and challenging.
39:35
So, can you talk a little bit about how that works?
39:38
That’s a good question, Natalia, because outreach alone, it
39:43
sounds easy, but it’s not.
39:45
The people--that’s why I always encourage and admire our staffs, my team, for that
39:56
skill that they have when it comes to the outreach and community organizers.
40:00
There’s people that—people might think that, “oh, it, maybe people will come.”
40:07
No, it didn’t really, you know, do that way. There’s a lot of things, and I would
40:12
say that one thing is coming from trust.
40:17
Our team here, we—our community organizers, the most of them are actually
40:22
coming from the community, including myself, who’s very strongly, actively
40:28
involved with their own community.
40:30
And I could say that almost everybody in my team within
40:39
the community health department--like Mr. Lee Po Cha, he’s our director, but he’s
40:41
really rooted and very strong connected with the Hmong and Lao community; like
40:46
Mr. Hongsa, he’s very well-connected, not just near the Lao community but
40:50
from the Burmese community and some of the Thai, Thai community and some
40:56
of the Bhutanese and the Nepalese.
41:02
So there are so many communities in there.
41:05
We—what we do is through
41:10
our programs that work together through the civic engagement and the leadership
41:16
programs; we already have the database of who’s the community leaders.
41:21
It—often times, it doesn’t really happen that I can walk into the event and
41:28
say that “let me share with you what’s happening.” It’s really hard, and I,
41:35
several years, through the—I work as
41:39
a partnerships assistant through
41:43
the Census program in 2010.
41:46
So, it was my job—so like, community outreach and also
41:50
work within the community.
41:51
Through their community
41:55
leaders, that’s where we start because they already have the trust; their
42:00
community already selected a leader within their community, and they believe
42:05
more than any of us who’s coming.
42:09
It is kind of one of the reasons why we want to help strengthen their
42:14
skill and their leadership skills.
42:17
To go back to your question, there’s—let’s say if you need to have any of an event,
42:23
the first person we pick up the phone call, or—let’s say, this information needs
42:28
to go to the Cambodian, maybe that’s too easy, picking the Cambodian community,
42:34
but, let’s say it is an event that needs to go to a Vietnamese community.
42:38
So, the Vietnamese community is very big.
42:42
One person will not reach to the whole community.
42:45
The whole population would not just only whole, not just need to make
42:52
sure not only one person, one person cannot do; the same as a Cambodian
42:56
community even though the size of a Cambodian community is not the same.
43:00
But, so many ethnic communities here, they always have a, you know, different group.
43:07
So, that’s why it’s very important for us to empower more than
43:11
just the community leaders.
43:13
So what we would do is to connect to these leaders who we know, “okay this
43:21
leader’s at a temple, this leader’s at a church, this leader’s at an education
43:27
area.” So we try to connect and say, this information, that’s how we want
43:31
to pass to your community; how can we get that information to your community?
43:39
That’s one of the ways how we work as a community outreach because, again,
43:47
building trust is hard, but, and, also that’s why it has to take time
43:52
to earn the trust and be strongly respected and believed that the
43:58
trust that they have in their own
43:59
community already.
44:02
Here at the Asian Family Center, other centers that we want to have promoting
44:08
the culturally specific programs, and to help connecting the people to the
44:15
right resource and the right service, we want to be the place and agency
44:24
to help them, mobilize them, to help them, to empower them, to—how can we
44:28
do to support on things that they need to do, like, within their own community
44:35
through technical assistance, through whatever, like, the civic engagement,
44:39
through anything so we can help.
44:42
So any, kind of, information that we receive or we know that will be very
44:49
beneficial to any kind of community, we try to pass it on to those communities.
44:56
I hope I answered your question.
44:58
Yes, that was wonderful.
44:58
Thank you.
44:58
Okay.
45:01
So, what do you see, in your opinion, as some of the recommendations for
45:07
the future, if you have future plans or ideas of what you would like
45:11
to see the Asian Family Center do?
45:14
What you would like to do with your role, with your current position?
45:17
Can you talk a little bit about your hopes and your plans?
45:23
Of course I want to have a lot more money.
45:27
You know, it’s not just need the money part, but it’s also, because
45:31
of the funding, we can do a lot more.
45:35
But, in particular, the reason why, too, is because we want to – I see more of the
45:41
education and community development as
45:45
they really need within, especially, the Asian Pacific Islanders.
45:51
Here in particular, for the Asian Family Center, like I mentioned earlier, we serve
45:55
a culturally specific center, so we want—I want to, kind of, see the future that
46:02
my vision is to see how can we continue to help promoting each ethnic community.
46:14
I want to do more of the leadership development program.
46:18
I do want to see that we do more of the improving of the youth
46:25
development; improving the wellness from the parenting and in from the
46:32
birth to all the way to, you know, through there—from the birth-time
46:36
to all the way to the high school.
46:38
Oh, and then take on what will be helping to support, you know, through the
46:47
college, through wherever is going to become the family.
46:50
So it is whatever is in every corner that we can help providing any kind
46:57
of service to be a support to that.
47:02
And, to be a part of—connect them to take on and be stronger, kind of like, they
47:10
can speak louder for their own community.
47:13
Right now, they only probably whisper, or they only say things to us; but,
47:19
if you want to change--we want to do social change and often times,
47:25
especially when it comes to our society, we’ve been talking about equity.
47:30
So, we want to see things different.
47:32
And, I strongly believe that when it comes to the people of color
47:37
here, the number is going up.
47:40
So, the population is more; how do we make that become, you know, awareness?
47:46
There’s a big, you know—see that the data is shifting.
47:50
So they need to speak louder to, kind of, see, “okay this is what our
47:55
community wants—what our community—what works and what not.” You know, I think
47:59
that community development is one
48:03
of the biggest parts.
48:08
Most importantly, we definitely want to continue helping them to
48:14
fill the gap with the social disparity and economic disparity--to help anything
48:20
that we can improve their lives, to make their resettlement here, as they
48:27
come as immigrants and refugees, to help them feel that they’re home.
48:32
I mean, many of them have gone through so much trauma already, it is—you know, we
48:38
don’t want them to face that poverty line.
48:42
I feel that that’s kind of a big wish.
48:46
And, if because it’s also have to, you know, connect with
48:51
the system change as well.
48:53
So that’s the reason why I mentioned community development;
48:57
it is very important to help being part of the system change.
49:02
Right.
49:02
And in terms of addressing the needs and doing a needs assessment
49:08
with the community, do you also work through the community leaders?
49:13
Do you host events where community members are able to tell you what their needs are?
49:19
How does that work in terms of asking people what their needs are?
49:23
And then, are people willing to share what they need, or can
49:27
that be challenging sometimes for people to express their desires?
49:32
Yes, very good questions.
49:35
In fact, IRCO is one of, I would say, one of the only organizations
49:40
that put together, it’s called, a community needs assessment.
49:44
So, every three years, we’ve been putting together the community assessment.
49:51
Recently here--the last one that we had was just in June this year,
49:57
I’m sure you heard about that.
50:00
So, we invited all the community leaders.
50:04
The recruitment was challenging, like, you know, you know getting their
50:09
participation and the commitment.
50:11
And we value their time; we respect that because it means so much,
50:17
especially when we ask for a day long.
50:21
It was a day-long event, so us and IRCO,--you know the IRCO agency,
50:28
not just only the Asian Family Center--we put together the community
50:34
assessment by inviting all the communities from ethnic groups.
50:40
I’m more than happy to share a little bit of how the process works.
50:44
For this year--I’m going to talk about this year because that’s where I
50:49
experienced the most and was part of one of the organizers in putting the event
50:53
together—we were reaching our through staff, through the community leaders.
51:00
We were trying to reach out to all their community members, community leaders to
51:05
come and participate at a conference.
51:08
And, as a result, we had just over 40 people who signed up, we had their names.
51:17
We had 142
51:20
community members who came.
51:23
We believe that we had more because there were so many people who
51:26
came, they don’t really sign-up.
51:29
The structure or the process here: We divided, separated them into eight
51:36
groups based on their ethnic groups.
51:39
One of them is—so we even separated the Asian Pacific Islanders.
51:44
Like I mentioned earlier, Asian Pacific Islanders is so big.
51:46
So we separated the Asian Pacific Islanders’ established
51:47
communities—like the Cambodian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Hmong, Lao.
51:47
These are the communities who have really been here for a long time and are
51:49
already settled and established their own family; so, their need is totally
51:49
different from the newcomers who’s the Pacific Islanders from Turkey and from,
51:49
like the Burmese, the Bhutanese, who’s the Asian community from Southeast Asia.
51:50
So, Asian Pacific Islander established,
52:03
the Pacific Islander, they have their own
52:15
group.
52:15
Burmese alone, it
52:37
was challenging; and, do you know why?
52:40
Why?
52:41
Because they speak different languages.
52:44
So, they are—they can say they are from Burma, but there was Karen,
52:51
Zomi , Kachin, and then Burmese.
52:55
So, they have their own really small tribes, their own—it’s a
52:58
different group which is the Burmese; however, we still put them together.
53:03
They were a really big group.
53:05
Bhutanese and Nepalese group, they kind of sharing the same—they’re similar;
53:11
so they were in the same group.
53:13
Slavic community, they were in one group; Middle East, the people coming from Iraq.
53:21
And what is the other one, Africans.
53:24
So, we had the African group also, you know, within their own group
53:32
as well, so that way they can speak their own language.
53:36
Slavic, again, they conduct the meeting in their own language.
53:43
So, the first session that we asked them to share with us: What really
53:48
the needs are, so it’s a discussion.
53:51
The needs around—we, kind of, gave them some eight topics—the transportation,
53:59
the education, community development, economic, health, and…so, kind
54:06
of mentioned, their discussion in housing, parenting, domestic
54:11
violence, surrounding those topics.
54:13
And I let them share more [about] what really they see
54:16
within their own community.
54:19
After that, we asked them to prioritize.
54:23
If they want to see the change, what’s really the most
54:26
need within their community?
54:26
Many of them
54:31
pick education as the topic—kind of one of the top.
54:35
Community development, and, also, it depends on each community; so some
54:41
communities like—I forgot to mention that we did have Latino too, so there were
54:49
eight—so like Latino, transportation is one of the things that they mentioned
54:54
as one of the needs as a part of the top priority besides education.
55:02
They did address about the driver’s license issue as well.
55:07
So, it was just an example that how we conduct and, kind of, assess.
55:12
We just, kind of, are almost wrapping up and finalizing the
55:17
report of how we seen through the needs that we have in the community.
55:22
But, they are sitting in a really small group, even though we want
55:27
it small, but then the group is arranged around, like, ten people
55:31
to, like, thirty people for some.
55:33
It depends on some ethnic groups.
55:35
Ask them to be there from nine o’clock until four thirty, so
55:40
that’s really an all-day-long.
55:43
But you can tell that these people are the people who really committed, who really
55:48
want to be a part of their community, and they represented their own community.
55:53
They care so much about their
55:56
community that
55:59
they are aware what’s going on, and they want to pass it on to us.
56:05
It’s very important for us, as a community-based organization, to hear that
56:10
and see how we can be here to help them.
56:14
So, we want to make sure that we continue to provide the service
56:19
that they need in the community.
56:22
So then you’re able to use that information to apply for grants, to
56:27
develop programs, to build partnerships?
56:30
You use that data, that evidence, as showcasing what your community needs?
56:34
Yes.
56:34
What this data is really helping our agency, in particular, for our
56:40
development team, so that the development team can use this data to help us
56:47
look into what’s available grants out there, [and] how we can work to
56:53
design or work to find a resource for the needs within the community.
57:01
And, when it comes to the , our strategic plan, we want to make sure
57:06
that we have our strategy planned around the needs from the community
57:19
who we serve.
57:19
Wonderful.
57:20
So, those are most of my questions for the Asian Family Center.
57:23
I would like to talk to you a little bit about the other work that you do.
57:27
But, do you have anything else that you’d like to share in terms of the Asian
57:31
Family Center before we switch topics?
57:33
Um.
57:35
I think some—I’m good.
57:37
I think that I shared a lot already.
57:39
Okay.
57:39
Okay, well if something comes back to you, then we can talk about that again.
57:43
Okay, yeah, definitely.
57:44
So, I’m interested in your work with
58:00
the Golden Leaf Education Foundation.
58:03
Can you talk a little bit about that organization and your role with it and
58:03
the mission and what you do with that?
58:03
So the Golden Leaf Education Foundation is, really, a volunteer
58:05
work, a volunteer organization.
58:08
I can share a little bit of how it started.
58:12
When it first started, one of the survivors,—he’s a Cambodian American
58:18
to have born here - Kilong Ung.
58:21
He decided to put together a memoir, like, a book through his life, through Khmer
58:29
Rouge.
58:29
By publishing that book called Golden Leaf--he published that in 2009.
58:35
He worked together with the Royal Rosarians, and he’s wrote, he’s a
58:38
fellow Rotarian through the rotary clubs [?] . He said that one of giving
58:45
back to Cambodia - he wants to help building schools through education.
58:53
So, we feel that the Cambodian community--of course, he used to be
58:59
the president within the community and he’s very active with the Cambodian
59:02
community—there’s many of us, including the Cambodian-American community, during
59:09
that time say that “are you going to build in Cambodia?” So, the Cambodian
59:14
community really has been a strong support and they say that they want to build
59:19
one school, so, let’s put a fundraising event. Let’s do potluck to build one
59:25
school, or do a fundraising event.
59:30
Then we formed, kind of, around 2010.
59:32
So in 2010,
59:36
the organization was under the Cambodian-American community
59:40
in Oregon called CACO.
59:44
They were just, kind of, the fiscal agent that operated--but the mission for the
59:50
Golden Leaf Education Foundation is to enhance the educational opportunity for
59:55
the children in-need internationally.
59:58
Cambodia has been our pilot country.
1:00:02
So we put together the fundraising.
1:00:06
It was very successful.
1:00:08
I believe, if I remember correctly, we raised over 30,000.
1:00:12
And, we say, “well, of course it’s not enough to build a school
1:00:16
yet,” but we’re really excited.
1:00:18
We already had the first school, and the support, we will see
1:00:22
it continue, its keep coming.
1:00:25
So, just empower—you know, inspired by the story of survivors and want
1:00:31
to see that through the education.
1:00:33
And many of us, including myself, I—my dad was the professor.
1:00:39
So even when I grew up I didn’t really want to be a professor or a teacher
1:00:46
like him, but I feel that education is what Cambodia really needs because I see
1:00:53
that area still needs a lot of help in school; and just, you know, if you don’t
1:00:59
have the school building, and people don’t have enough place—don’t have the
1:01:04
building for the kid to go to school, the kid cannot go to school because of
1:01:09
travelling, the family really is not going to send their kid to go to school
1:01:14
because the population in Cambodia,
1:01:21
they’re still very poor.
1:01:22
In 2011, they recruited me to take on the leadership role as the executive
1:01:27
director of the organization without pay, so…it took me a while to decide that.
1:01:37
During that time I think I was about to start with the corporate work
1:01:43
before I move to Asian Family Center, but I have been very passionate
1:01:49
about giving back to Cambodia.
1:01:52
Humanitarian work is something that my husband and I are very,
1:01:57
you know, passionate about.
1:02:00
So, I decided to take on the role to, kind of, lead the organization.
1:02:08
This was in the 2000’s when I first started in 2011.
1:02:12
And now, we’re about to finish our third school.
1:02:16
Wonderful.
1:02:16
So, the roof, they just put up the roof for the
1:02:22
third school last week.
1:02:22
And, we expect that it’s gonna finish it before the end of this year.
1:02:28
And, next year, in January, we plan to build the fourth one.
1:02:34
So, um, over there.
1:02:36
So, we’re very excited.
1:02:38
We’ve been putting together most of the funding.
1:02:40
It’s coming—so everybody—the organization is 100% volunteer-based.
1:02:48
Many of them just volunteer and dedicated their time to the organization.
1:02:54
So, most of the time, it’s really not interfering with any of my work.
1:03:00
When I joined the AFC,
1:03:03
I shared that with our associate director and also the executive
1:03:08
director, I will not use, you know, I will make sure to divide my time.
1:03:15
Most of that
1:03:15
happened during, my volunteer work, during either the weekend or the evening
1:03:21
even though the weekend I also work for AFC through all the leadership programs.
1:03:27
So, it’s been very challenging, as well, to be able to do the two
1:03:32
non-profits for pay and non-pay.
1:03:37
But, um, for the Golden Leaf Education Foundation, we receive a great support
1:03:43
from the community and also through the board to put together our income.
1:03:50
I would say, like, all of them is coming from donations, individual donors, and
1:03:57
supporters, and through our fundraising event that we have once a year.
1:04:03
This year’s, like, just two months—last month actually, in
1:04:07
August, that our fifth annual fundraising event, we raised 55,000.
1:04:15
It’s been very successful, so far, based on, just, you
1:04:20
know, only volunteer efforts.
1:04:23
So, have you travelled to Cambodia to see the schools built?
1:04:27
Is that part of what you do?
1:04:30
So to travel—so, it’s not--the organization will not pay
1:04:36
for any of my travelling.
1:04:39
We do not compensate for that.
1:04:42
And also, it’s not something that—it’s not my expectation
1:04:46
for the organization to hire me.
1:04:48
I feel that not just give free volunteer time, it’d also be donating
1:04:54
some of their time too because of, just, the compassion that we have
1:04:59
for the work that organizations do.
1:05:02
We went back to Cambodia through some—just to visit.
1:05:08
When it was, we went to visit the school.
1:05:11
The first one—the Cambodian-American community in Oregon and Golden Leaf
1:05:16
Education Foundation put together a humanitarian trip in 2009,
1:05:24
I think it was the very first one.
1:05:27
But it was really small during that time; we hadn’t really built any schools yet.
1:05:34
So starting after that, in 2011, the end of 2011,
1:05:40
we had a big one; there was about 31 or 32 people.
1:05:45
So we did the trip for two weeks.
1:05:48
Besides just go around the country and site-seeing, we went to visit all
1:05:53
the orphanages and all the schools.
1:05:55
That—in 2011, that’s when we went to the first Golden Leaf
1:06:01
inauguration for the first school.
1:06:05
Then, early this year, we went back because the family even [went] too,
1:06:12
so we were able to do some of the grand opening—to do the grand opening
1:06:15
for the second school and the ground breaking for the third school.
1:06:19
Next year, there’s going to be another humanitarian trip
1:06:22
that we’re putting together.
1:06:24
And, so far, we had about 21 or 22 people.
1:06:29
My husband and I and another couple, who’re from the Cambodian community,
1:06:36
coordinate helping part of the tour and work with the tour agency in Cambodia.
1:06:42
But, we pay the same, we donated the same, we donate our airfare,
1:06:49
we pay for the fee-package.
1:06:52
But it’s just part of involving—kind of the fee, in a
1:06:57
way, to involve the organization.
1:06:59
So, for the next one, we will have an opening for the third
1:07:03
school and do a groundbreaking for
1:07:11
the number four.
1:07:11
Wonderful.
1:07:11
You mentioned your work with that organization, with the
1:07:15
Cambodian-American Community of Oregon.
1:07:18
Are there any other community organizations that you work with
1:07:22
that you’d like to talk about?
1:07:23
Or are those the main ones?
1:07:26
That sounds like a lot already.
1:07:28
Those are the main ones.
1:07:29
I think that before I accepted the Golden Leaf Education Foundation as
1:07:36
the role of the executive director, or volunteer executive director, I limited
1:07:43
myself only to the Asian Family Center
1:07:49
advisory board during that time because my, just, my passion
1:07:54
about the work that the agency, IRCO’s Asian Family Center, does.
1:08:01
I didn’t really--during that time, I’d already done my term
1:08:04
as a vice-president of the Cambodian-American Community of Oregon.
1:08:09
So, I limited myself, only those.
1:08:12
One of the reasons, too, I think, is that because I just had my first son as
1:08:19
well, and we wanted to have another one.
1:08:22
So now, we have two.
1:08:24
So there’s kind of a family growing and changing, so it
1:08:27
limited the volunteer work.
1:08:30
But, before that—before the Golden Leaf Education Foundation—I was very
1:08:37
actively involved with the Asian Pacific-American Chamber of Commerce.
1:08:44
I was one of the founding board-members when it first started.
1:08:49
So I involved with them for a while; and I’m still supporting the organization
1:08:56
even though I’m not a part of it anymore.
1:08:58
But, I’m still involved with that.
1:09:01
There’s so many other organizations, but right now, just trying to
1:09:06
limit myself to the work that we do; and, especially, the work that
1:09:12
I do here at the Asian Family Center is also helping me to give back
1:09:18
to, not just native communities with Cambodia, but is also local.
1:09:24
So, I still can continue to involve with other organizations that I used
1:09:30
to involve with but, just, through the work that I do here at AFC.
1:09:37
Wonderful.
1:09:40
Well, in closing, throughout your answers and your discussions, you mentioned
1:09:48
several people who mentored you.
1:09:51
And you, yourself, with everything that you’ve accomplished, what advice would
1:09:56
you give to youth, to young people who perhaps would like to follow in your
1:10:02
footsteps and would see you as a mentor?
1:10:04
What would you tell them in terms of advice in the work that you
1:10:09
do in community engagement and in working with these organizations
1:10:12
and giving back to the community?
1:10:15
That’s a very good question.
1:10:18
You know, even though I have been through many—I’ve seen many people
1:10:22
as a role-models and as mentors, I haven’t been playing as a mentor myself.
1:10:29
What comes to my mind first, I would say, like, do not give up.
1:10:34
It’s—you’re not going to be successful at just a one-time try, so if
1:10:41
you’ve won, just keep doing that.
1:10:43
Just keep going.
1:10:47
So, don’t give up, and it’s not the end of the world.
1:10:50
So, I feel that that’s, kind of, what comes up right now, and that’s the
1:10:56
message that I got from my dad too.
1:11:00
So, my father told me, just, you know, say that you have to keep trying.
1:11:07
It doesn’t mean that it’s not
1:11:11
going work this time—because it didn’t work this time, doesn’t mean that
1:11:14
it’s not gonna work the next one.
1:11:17
Wonderful.
1:11:18
Well, is there anything else that you’d like to share?
1:11:20
Anything that we didn’t cover?
1:11:22
Anything that you’d like to expand upon?
1:11:25
I think that we covered a lot already.
1:11:27
I’d be more than happy to do any kind of follow-up, to give
1:11:30
you additional info later, or if there’s anything else you need.
1:11:36
But um, I appreciate the time—that you’re taking time and working with
1:11:40
us through this project; it’s taking a lot of your time and a commitment
1:11:46
to come all the way up here.
1:11:48
So, we greatly appreciate all the work you do
1:12:00
with us.
