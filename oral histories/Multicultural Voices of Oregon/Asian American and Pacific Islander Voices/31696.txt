00:03
My name is Natalia Fernández and I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian
00:08
at Oregon State University Special Collections and Archives Research Center,
00:12
the Oregon Multicultural Archives.
00:14
Today’s date is February 16, 2016 and we are at the Asian Family Center.
00:22
About a year and a half ago, in September of 2014, we conducted
00:26
an oral history interview and this is a follow up to that interview.
00:29
So we’ll go ahead and get started.
00:31
If you could please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:35
My name is Sophorn Cheang and its spelled S-O-P-H-O-R-N, last name C-H-E-A-N-G.
00:43
Okay.
00:44
So let’s get started with some of the changes that have occurred within
00:49
the Asian Family Center in this past year and a half, specifically
00:54
the administrative changes.
00:56
There have been changes so welcome back [laughs] . So as you know that in 2014
01:03
when we first started the project, Mr. Lee Po Cha was the director of the IRCO
01:08
Asian Family Center and last year in April of 2015, Mr. Lee Po Cha got promoted
01:18
from the associate director and also the Asian Family Center director - he
01:23
became our executive director of IRCO.
01:27
Our former executive director Mr. Sokhom Tauch retired last year.
01:32
So during the transi, it was the transition have happening quickly,
01:38
but it’s not in a way of this year going through some process.
01:44
The board and the IRCO board and the IRCO Asian Family Center advisory
01:49
board and Mr. Lee decide to, promoted me as their interim manager for
01:57
IRCO Asian Family Center in the meantime, during the transition.
02:04
So were you excited to become the interim manager?
02:08
I am excited, but there is so much to learn.
02:13
Mr. Lee left a, left a big shoe because he had done so much and his
02:18
involvement for like about three decades with an organization along with the
02:25
Asian Family Center, and the Asian Family Center was founded in 1994.
02:31
He has been the director of the Asian Family Center for a very long time so
02:37
there’s still a lot to learn, but I’m excited for the new opportunity and
02:43
also to learn new things from him.
02:46
So with your role as the interim manager does that mean that you
02:52
still kept your old role as well?
02:55
Yes, of course [laughs] . I love what I do and especially with the, with the capacity
03:02
as well, and since this is the interim position, I still acting, I’m still doing
03:09
the job as the manager of the community development, community health department.
03:14
So what does that mean in terms of your work that you’re,
03:17
you’re doing both positions?
03:20
Just need to know how to prioritize things a little bit more.
03:23
So
03:25
I, I’m just very lucky that I have a really supporting staff and a team
03:30
here, not just in here in the Asian Family Center, but IRCO our admin team
03:35
and our team at Africa House as well.
03:37
They’ve been very helpful during the transition and especially I want
03:43
to give the credit to, to my team for the community development team.
03:48
They been able to step up and are also really helping me taking on a little
03:54
bit more roles and responsibility, as my times have been very demanding, to
04:00
represent the IRCO Asian Family Center on top of doing the programming for
04:06
the community development programs.
04:09
So was the interim manager position what you thought it was going to be or are
04:16
things a little bit different being in that position from, from what you thought?
04:22
So I thought that Mr. Lee had so much to do and never really been
04:27
able to know exactly what he has done and he’s been very diplomatic and
04:34
he has so much knowledge about the community and as much as I knowledge
04:38
about the programming and operations.
04:41
I,
04:44
there’s a certain stuff that I didn’t really, you know if it’s not the way that
04:49
I thought it would be, but there’s certain things that I’m excited and enjoy doing
04:56
that you know with the board or to be able to fully represent our community and
05:03
also a part of one of the representatives of the organization, the immigrant
05:08
and refugee community organization and especially to continue promoting that
05:12
culturally relevant services for the API communities here in the state of Oregon.
05:19
So can you share a little bit more about what your duties are as the
05:23
interim manager, what your role is?
05:26
So we stay working on our job description [laughs] as we never really got to, to
05:34
as Mr. Lee has been really director for the Asian Family Center for a long time
05:40
and since we are on that topic there is going to be and internal process
05:44
here at the IRCO, at IRCO to conduct an interview and to kind of internal,
05:50
internally promotion so there’s going to be a process happening within a couple,
05:56
within a month here to select who’s going to be our permanent position for this.
06:02
But my main goal is to really oversee all the operations, and administration
06:08
here or here at the IRCO Asian Family Center on top of center the, the
06:15
community development department housed here at Asian Family Center is easier
06:21
for me because that’s my department.
06:24
But on top of that I have to be a closer relationship with our program
06:30
managers like the children department that some of the programs here and also
06:36
our youth academic services programs.
06:40
And we have two managers right now for that’s kind of a part of the transition
06:45
because you know, not Mr. Lee actually oversee, oversaw that department directly
06:51
on top of his job as the associate director and of Asian Family Center.
06:58
He directly managed the youth department with many support from our program
07:05
coordinators in the youth department so it’s just that building that collaboration
07:11
and also our anti-poverty department here as well at the Asian Family Center.
07:19
One of the kind of main roles is to continue to allocate and also promote the
07:27
API culture and services and really building strong connections with the
07:32
funders and our ethnic community leaders to continue looking for funding, develop
07:39
programming, and at the same time
07:45
all the admin and operations here in this center.
07:53
So you have worked and been connected to the AFC for many years now, but with this
08:00
role where you are managing all of the different departments and you’re getting
08:06
to know the different departments a little more deeply has anything surprised
08:10
you, have you learned new things about the Asian Family Center that the interim
08:15
position has enabled you to learn?
08:17
I have learned so much, you’re not going
08:23
to believe it [laughs] that its always, you know, when you and I continue to
08:28
represent the programs all the programs at a higher level, but it’s actually has
08:34
been a great opportunity for me to be in, to be able to work directly with not just
08:39
the program manager, but also our program coordinators on the programming level.
08:45
So I get to see that what is the program look like; I get to
08:54
see their events, their programming’s, their workshop,
08:55
so it’s some of their work.
08:58
Some of them it doesn’t really surprise me it’s more of like, you know, that they
09:04
have done, our staff have worked, has been working so hard and it’s actually showed
09:09
that they have put a lot of effort and it’s in a way this really impressed me.
09:15
And I already know that they, they already been working hard, but
09:18
it’s good to really be able to connect it in a different level.
09:23
In terms of learning, still learning, that’s never going to be ending so
09:30
that’s some part that I enjoy doing that as well as working with them to,
09:36
to be able to advocate for additional funding or continue the program.
09:41
Has your role as interim manager influenced your other role in terms
09:46
of the community development program, have you learned new things and
09:50
then applied it to that position?
09:53
Yes and, and at the same time it, it this could be the other way, its, its leading
10:00
to a little bit of the confusing from some of our community partners so it’s
10:05
like, “are you the interim manager for Asian Family Center, are you managing
10:10
this program?”- but it’s just the nature of the community based organizations.
10:15
Many of us have to wear multiple hats within the organization, so many of
10:21
our funders have been able to, to adapt and understand that very well.
10:25
I have learned so much from Mr. Lee and also from other senior managers to
10:33
be able to apply that and continue to develop, but at the same time of course
10:39
that is where, when the challenges and the barriers coming in with my time
10:45
to fully support the team, but like I mentioned earlier, our staff is really
10:52
stepping up and fully take role as I am, as a program coordinators and being able
10:58
to, to have taken on some of the, the responsibility and task for the programs.
11:09
And you’ve already talked a little bit about this, but can you share a
11:14
little bit more about the community reaction and especially with the
11:19
retirement of the executive director and then Mr. Lee Po Cha taking that
11:22
role and then you taking on this role?
11:25
Sometimes those types of transitions can be difficult for
11:28
the community or sometimes they can recognize the, the positive.
11:32
Can you talk a little bit about that?
11:34
Yeah sure, so one of the good things.
11:37
IRCO has been well known to the community for many years and this year we are
11:42
celebrating our forty years anniversary.
11:46
Mr. Lee has been around for the community for many, many years, for
11:51
the three decades so with how long he’s been working here, so with his
11:56
new role it’s not a surprise because he has done so much and his connection,
12:02
his credibility, and his hard work.
12:05
We are very excited to have, to be under his leadership and take on the position.
12:12
Mr. Sokhom left us a good like, at the organization at a really good
12:20
level and a very high, but this year we, we continue to grow that.
12:26
The organization was, when Mr. Sokhom around 14, around 14 million, quickly this
12:34
year we are about to become a 15 million dollars operation for the organization.
12:40
So I would say that it was not a surprise for the community because the funders,
12:46
the local govern, the local government agencies and other community partners,
12:51
community leaders they were very aware that, and they, many of them are I can
12:58
say that most of them are very excited as far as I know for the transition
13:04
that Mr. Lee leading the organization.
13:07
In terms of my position, I have been building a good relationship
13:11
with our advisory board and many of our work governing IRCO,
13:17
governing board members as well.
13:19
I have been working very closely with many of the ethnic community leaders
13:26
and as my role managing the department, the community development department.
13:33
I also been working closely with the funders, local government agency,
13:40
and other community partners so they, I’m not new to the community as
13:47
far as we know there’s no reaction.
13:50
Everything has been going smoothly, we have received great support, not
13:56
just only from the community members, but especially staff here internally
14:02
because we are here for a reason and we are here to help the community to
14:07
benefit the community so we know our role and what we’re supposed to be doing.
14:13
So you mentioned that the interim position will, is that an interim
14:19
position and within the next few weeks or month that there will be an internal
14:24
search for the permanent position.
14:26
Does that involve the community input or because it’s an internal search
14:30
it’ll be internal to the AFC, and does the advisory board have a role
14:35
and they represent the community and that would be the community voice?
14:39
Yes.
14:40
So our, our organization not just IRCO alone, but IRCO Asian Family
14:46
Center as well, we have been community driven so our programs and services
14:51
have been something that we have heard and hear from the community.
14:56
Of course with this type of position it, we also rely on our advisory
15:03
board members who right now we have ten advisory board members.
15:08
I have been informed them during transition of Mr. Lee also
15:13
doing a great job of informing them about this transition.
15:17
I also, I also know that there’s going to be an input and a collaboration
15:23
from our advisory board members especially our co-chairs and as well
15:29
as the involvement from the governing board, IRCO governing board as well.
15:34
And you are right, in terms of the community input that they are they
15:40
community leaders, they are here for you know to, to represent.
15:44
They are here, a part of the agency to represent and bring
15:48
the voice of the community.
15:50
So it is very important to have them involved in the process.
15:54
The same thing as about last year, ten, eleven months ago this transition
16:02
also has been approved and supported by both, not just the board, but
16:09
especially the advisory board co-chairs and our board presidents as well
16:15
before Mr. Lee was able to promoted me as just an interim position.
16:21
So of course they will be a part of the process until the end.
16:27
And speaking of the advisory board, you recently had a board retreat.
16:33
Could you share a little bit about how that went, the purpose of board retreats
16:38
and what came out of that meeting?
16:41
What the goals are and the outcomes and the vision for the year?
16:45
So we have done the advisory board and the staff retreat like every year.
16:50
We didn’t really get a chance to do that the last year because of the
16:54
timing with our community leadership programs happening around the same time.
16:59
So we pushed it to early this year.
17:02
The really main goal is really giving others - there’s a couple
17:06
of main goals, first of all its to make sure that our board continues
17:10
to be informed, our advisory board members continue to be informed to
17:15
what’s going on within the agency.
17:18
The works that we do and at the same time, the really, the second goal is
17:23
really building a strong co-relationship with our staff, especially our program
17:29
managers and program coordinators who’s really leading some of the programs and
17:35
this type of retreat is really, give us the time to strategize and focus on
17:43
what’s really important to the community as receiving the inputs from them - as
17:49
I mentioned earlier that the ten people who are in our AFC advisory board they
17:56
are representing various communities from the pacific islander communities
18:02
so they are bringing all those ethnic, you know, community perspectives
18:08
and the voice from the community.
18:11
In particular, was the feedback of what should we be looking at, what are we
18:15
missing, why has been the challenges and the barriers to us, but at the
18:22
same time they are also acting as the, as the representative and help
18:28
promoting the agency as well to, to the funders, to the other community members.
18:34
So the, the retreat this year it went very well because it was our sort of transition
18:40
that happening late last year that both Lyn and Ellen, I believe you already
18:48
met with Lyn and interviewed Lyn as
18:52
well as in her previous role.
18:53
Now she’s the co-manager for the youth department with Ellen Parker.
18:59
So with those types of transitions it’s you know, there’s changes, but at the
19:04
same time this type of restructuring it helps us to be stronger as we continue to
19:12
grow like the whole agency and especially here at the Asian Family Center.
19:18
So we will be able to, we were able to collaborate and be a stronger
19:25
relationship not just only among the staff, but especially within the board
19:32
members as well so they get to know each other and find a way of how can
19:38
they support each other on the higher level that we’re still respecting their
19:43
time because as advisory board members they volunteer their time so we want to
19:48
make sure that we are being respectful.
19:52
Great.
19:53
And so you talk about strengthening a relationship
19:57
within the Asian Family Center.
20:00
What about the relationships between the other, the other bigger programs like
20:06
Africa House and the other programs within IRCO; in your role as interim manager
20:11
have those relationships strengthened?
20:13
Have you got a sense of the bigger picture that is IRCO because of your interim role?
20:18
So it gives before more of like what I, I had been doing before as the manager of
20:26
the department really looking into, still looking into the big picture, but at the
20:31
same time really focused on my department.
20:36
Now it’s been it’s a great opportunity to, to partner with the Africa
20:41
House and also the Senior Services; especially I would say Africa House.
20:47
So Jimmy Dogo [?] who’s the manager of the Africa House and I, we’ve
20:53
been able to collaborate like doing a presentation together to the schools,
20:59
to the other funders, to the community partners, and also the local government
21:03
agency, really work as a team.
21:07
At the same time because of not the community development or some part of our
21:13
programs housed at the Africa House, the same thing as our youth academic services
21:19
program also housed at Africa House.
21:22
So we’ve been able to regularly do a check in and see that, what to fine,
21:28
can I fine tune and strategize what would be the best way to continue a
21:33
stronger collaboration either through the programing, but at the same time it’s
21:39
really continue to promote both of the agencies as culturally specific agencies.
21:46
So those have been changing a little bit that as I am taking more responsibility
21:54
and becoming interim manager.
21:57
It allowed me to, to kind of see a bigger picture and I always wanted
22:04
to, to do more so this is actually a great time and it helped me to kind of
22:13
implementing some of the visions that I have envisioned that what I would
22:17
like to see within the, the agency.
22:22
Could you share a little bit about what that has been - what your vision has been?
22:27
A year and a half ago when we had our interview you had talked about your
22:32
recommendations and what you were hoping for with the Asian Family Center and
22:36
in your new role have you been able to put into practice some of the things
22:39
you had been thinking about previously?
22:42
Yes and no, and I’m going to be honest because I mean we have so many, we
22:47
have so many programs that are in IRCO.
22:50
Right now we operate like within 128 programs at IRCO, let alone there’s so
22:56
many programs here, you know probably I could say like one third or so is
23:02
like here at the Asian Family Center and outside at the school-base level.
23:07
So in terms of some changes there’s a certain limitation.
23:12
I want to be respectful of like what’s coming in as a changing because we
23:18
are not changing and only here at the Asian Family Center, but the whole
23:24
entire organization also changed too because our leadership has changed.
23:32
So, so there’s certain stuff that I was able to implement, like working closely
23:39
with the program managers, set up the time to really do a check in and then improving
23:45
our all staff meeting to a better structure, we are still trying to fine
23:52
tune that, just like more interacting, more engaging and at the same time it’s
23:57
really being productive and effective and it doesn’t mean that before it didn’t,
24:04
but because of things moving so quickly sometimes it becomes a routine so we just
24:10
want to bring in that new energy but at the same time doing a little bit more
24:17
of that interaction within and among the staff and really break down the silo.
24:23
So that’s kind of one of, kind of the main goal as IRCO’s strategic plans, but really
24:31
part of my vision as well to, to make sure the collaboration is really happening
24:37
and really focus on you know being or consider on that staff development.
24:45
That there is an opportunity for them to grow within the organization, giving and
24:51
kind of cultivate some of the leadership as we are providing the leadership
24:56
development to the community base we don’t want to forget about our internal staff.
25:05
So we want to make sure that we are kind of capturing that and we want to really
25:11
cultivate our staff to develop like professionally so wherever they want to
25:17
see they grow within the organization.
25:21
That’s wonderful.
25:22
Do you think that it was your role as a staff member that helped informed then
25:29
that you wanted to help your fellow staff members now that you have the power
25:35
within the interim manager position?
25:37
I
25:39
wouldn’t say that the, the power, but it’s more like the…
25:43
The opportunity?
25:44
The opportunity, thank you.
25:46
I, you know, I appreciate that opportunity to be able to help them,
25:53
to be aboard, to coach them in a way of like, in a different hat and
26:02
there’s certain things that of course they might feel confused and I’ve been
26:06
able to work with some of the staff and say that you know I’m open to
26:11
any type of conversation be able to wear multiple hats, either as just a
26:18
program manager on a certain program or as the department manager or the
26:24
interim manager for Asian Family Center.
26:28
So I want them to look into the way of light that you know, that conversation
26:34
or the collaboration working together internally is really allowed me to bring
26:41
in some of the different perspectives as a role, as my role here at the Asian Family
26:48
Center and really connecting, you know we not here, we are Asian Family Center is,
26:54
we don’t really operate independently, it’s under the operation of IRCO, the
27:00
Immigrant Refugee Community Organization.
27:02
We are just a division, a program of IRCO.
27:07
So it’s very important for our staff that to, to, to kind of think in a
27:12
big picture of say not working solo and connecting with our main office
27:18
and other programs at Africa House.
27:20
So I would like to see me as more of like at least being that bridge to
27:27
those centers and then also the admin as well and as my role representing
27:36
the agency has allowed me to connect and get a closer relationship with our
27:40
ethnics community based organization and I’m sure you said through some of
27:44
your conversation, we called them the MAA, the Mutual Assistance Association.
27:51
So those ethnic based community
27:56
organizations we’ve been able to kind of work with the other community
27:58
leaders through various programs as community partners and really
28:04
helping them to, to build their capacity within their own programs.
28:10
We cannot really help, I mean their own agency, their own organization.
28:14
It’s not much, but we are really focused and really looking into
28:20
that culturally relevant services.
28:23
Make sure that they, that we are connecting and be able to work to
28:29
be sensitive and respond to their culture and their language as well.
28:37
Have you experienced, this might be a little bit of a difficult question, but
28:41
any, any barriers or any frustrations or anything that you wish that you could do,
28:49
but what are the limitations in terms of, is it time or resources or, what is it
28:56
that you wish that you could do if you had the, the perfect opportunities what would
29:00
that look like to be able to be able to do all your wonderful ideas that you have?
29:05
That’s probably too much.
29:07
What I wanted to do is probably too much to
29:11
ask.
29:11
The time for today that, there’s always about like and I’m going to speak that
29:19
as someone who’s really, as my role to representing the agency that really
29:24
hoping to, to have like the funders and the local government focus more that
29:32
our communities of color especially our immigrant refugees community our
29:37
growing here in the city of Portland.
29:39
So in terms of whatever is allocating, funding, any available
29:46
funding need to be really sensitive to the community as we grow.
29:50
The kids like at the school, kids right now, a majority of them are from
29:53
people of color, students of color.
29:53
So they
29:59
really play a big role and really how can we provide that cultural development
30:05
to them and know that what type of program.
30:09
So to, to sum that up its more like
30:14
funding and time so that way if it’s, if it’s really perfect important
30:19
that we have to worry about being able to, to have enough capacity.
30:27
We feel that, I’m just going to say that like for example, like health enrollment.
30:32
We know there’s an issue, we know that there’s too many people who want, who
30:36
still need to be enrolled into the system and probably most of them, not
30:42
probably, but most of them, the community of color, because of the barrier, the
30:46
language barrier, the system, access to the system, navigate through the system.
30:52
So those are the barriers and even those that have the, that
30:54
have insurance still don’t
30:56
know how to link to care, they still don’t know how to navigate through the system.
31:01
So we know there’s a problem, but do we have enough, you know available funding or
31:08
the considerations that how can we solve this problem, how can we make this better?
31:16
So in a perfect world we, I wanted to see like all the, the immigrants and
31:21
refugees they come here, they have a place to stay, don’t have to worry about
31:26
like housing, don’t have to worry that after they are here for eight months they
31:30
don’t really receive any more funding, they want you know they are afraid that
31:35
they are going to get kicked out and they never have to worry about it, they
31:39
didn’t have to worry about it before, where they came from because they came
31:42
straight from the camp, but now they just, they here, they don’t really know.
31:48
Housing has become really a big issue.
31:52
And that’s kind of, and if that’s really happen then that will solve my second
31:57
you know, kind of the problems what I want is the time because of right now
32:02
many of us are to where to do many roles and it’s like we limit the capacity
32:09
because of the limited resource help.
32:14
Well in this past year and a half many things have occurred on the national level
32:20
in terms of the politics of immigration and some politicians and some communities
32:31
not being accepting, not wanting to be accepting of immigrant populations.
32:37
Have, have you seen that affect your work here in Portland, has
32:41
that, have you seen the negative effects of that, of those types of
32:46
attitudes or have, has the Portland community continued to be welcoming?
32:54
The Portland community, thank goodness, of the 39 states that accept
32:57
the refugees because you know the,
33:03
there’s only 39 out of the 50 here in the states, here in the United
33:08
States that are willing to accept the refugees, which means that they are
33:11
willing to provide the food stamps, they are providing the, the funding, the
33:17
social services to the newly arrived.
33:21
Oregon has been one of the best states in term of like welcoming
33:26
the refugees and also the immigrant.
33:31
We have a great mayor in the city of Portland who is very welcoming, opened the
33:38
doors to the refugees, to the newcomers, the same as our governors as well.
33:44
So I, I think that there’s, you know, the negative perspective is always
33:50
going to happen, but thanks to our community members here in the, the
33:56
state of Oregon especially in Portland, they really opened the door to the
34:00
communities and to the new members.
34:03
So like the governor, like early this month she just met with,
34:09
with some of our community members, organized a group
34:12
to meet with the governor.
34:14
They represented 23 countries as refugees and immigrants and the governor met
34:22
the, the second Syrians family the first time and also our mayors, the
34:30
city of Portland mayor went to do a welcoming for a Syrian refugees as well.
34:37
That’s as far as I know so it’s been publicly announced that they, they
34:43
really opened the door, but at the same time with my role here I’m able to,
34:48
to witness that in person and I really appreciate to be here in the state of
34:54
Oregon, here in the city of Portland.
34:57
Working here and seated our local government, our community
35:01
really opened their arms, opened their doors to the newcomers.
35:06
So you know and especially for us as an organization, the agency, it is our job
35:13
so we continue to do our job, whoever is coming through the door we welcome them.
35:20
Wonderful.
35:20
And you mentioned a few issues that are, are still really significant
35:25
within the community, navigating the health system, the housing issue,
35:31
any other issues in the past year and a half since our last interview?
35:36
Anything changed with that or, or are they mainly the same issues?
35:41
Things have changed in terms, things have, one of the things that changed is the
35:45
housing because of the affordable housing and speaking that kind of specifically
35:50
not just in the state of Oregon, but more really in the city of Portland.
35:54
So affordable housing has been a really big issue.
35:58
The price increased, you know almost one and a half or double the rent so
36:06
those have been making a significant impact to, to our community especially
36:12
for the low income community members.
36:16
The healthcare system, we are not able to, there are still some of the policy
36:22
they are trying to, to ask that to lower the five year bar [?] which means that
36:28
whoever is the legal permanent who’s only been here less than five years
36:33
they cannot become, they cannot go into the Oregon health plan, so unless
36:39
they pass five years or are citizen.
36:41
So if they are the low income, they still have to pay for some
36:47
like premium or certain things like to navigate into the system.
36:52
There’s also the English learning language portion that also we, we continue to
37:00
work on just to make sure that there’s available, really a consideration and
37:05
insight, enough resources to really help those students to be successful
37:10
especially as I mentioned earlier, the students of color continue to grow in
37:16
our school systems here and let’s see, during right now there is the legislative
37:23
session of 2016, but I know many of the organizations prepare more for 2017 in
37:31
term of some of the legislative planning.
37:36
So do you have any hopes for this next year and it doesn’t necessarily have to
37:43
be connected with the interim manager position and, but just in general
37:47
for the AFC, especially reflecting back that it’s the forty years of,
37:53
of IRCO and just thinking towards the future, towards the next few decades?
38:00
I’m, I’m, I’m ready, I’m ready to, to tell, to have like, to hear Mr.
38:06
Lee saying that we’re going to grow, we’re going to double or whatever.
38:11
We will be doing right now as an agency.
38:16
I’m very positive that there’s going to be a big grow as we continue to, to
38:25
build that strong leadership development within the organization in a way that
38:31
how Mr. Lee structures the organization is going to bring in the fresh ideas,
38:37
bring new energy, but at the same time it’s really strengthened and enhanced,
38:42
our programming and develop, developing.
38:45
So as we are celebrating our forty years and continue to think in a big
38:52
forty years and continue to think in a big picture and what’s really
38:55
benefitting the community, continue to listen to our community members.
39:00
What they need, what the needs are, and what types of services that really
39:04
benefit to them and very optimistic and I feel that you know we will continue
39:11
to grow and the one that is going to benefit will be our community members.
39:17
So I’m excited to be a part of this change and part of the journey and
39:23
that’s, that’s kind of what I want to see either my role continue to be, the,
39:29
still be a manager of the community development or interim manager or
39:35
whatever the role is that I will be.
39:37
I’m going to be always here in the community.
39:42
Wonderful.
39:44
Well is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to
39:48
talk about or anything that we have discussed that you want to expand upon?
39:53
No, I think that we have covered so much.
39:55
I just wanted to, to take this time actually to thank you personally.
40:00
The effort to making the time and being really patient with us.
40:05
I hope that this is not the end yet and
40:09
I kind of thought that it was the end long time ago, why it’s so fast, but time
40:14
flies and you know I really appreciate on behalf of the agency for your patience and
40:21
your collaboration and all your hard work.
40:25
This is going to be very exciting for us to present it to our AFC advisory board,
40:31
but also to be able to share, we also want to share that with our IRCO board and Mr.
40:38
Lee as well, as well as Mr. Lee transition and he’s already aware of this project.
40:44
So this will be a good way of capturing what AFC, AFC has done for the last
40:53
over two decades, a part of, be a part of the agency and one of the very
40:59
first Asian Pacific Islander agency who provide the services to the community.
41:05
So thank you to the Oregon State University and especially you personally,
41:11
that’s already been making, always making the time to be available and
41:16
truly understanding our schedule.
41:18
Of course, well thank you so much.
41:21
Thank you.
