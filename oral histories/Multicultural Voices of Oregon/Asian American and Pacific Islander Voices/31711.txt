00:05
Today’s date is July 9, 2015.
00:10
We’re at the IRCO Asian Family Center.
00:12
My name is Natalia Fernandez, I am the curator of the Oregon Multicultural
00:17
Archives and this interview is part of an oral history project with the AFC
00:22
and so we will go ahead and get started.
00:24
Please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:27
I am Simeon [?] Mamaril.
00:32
And can you spell that please?
00:35
February, I was born February 12 of 1925 in
00:41
[?] , Philippines.
00:44
And do you identify as Filipino?
00:47
Yes, I am a Filipino.
00:48
Okay.
00:49
One hundred percent [laughs].
00:50
So your parents were also born there?
00:54
Your parents, where were they born?
00:56
In the Philippines too.
00:58
In the Philippines too.
00:58
Around what year, what years were they born?
01:02
My father was born June 11, 1899 and my mother April 7, 1904.
01:13
And so you grew up there, in the Philippines?
01:15
In the Philippines, yes.
01:17
And what was your life like there?
01:20
Pardon
01:20
Your life, did you live there all throughout your childhood?
01:24
Well you know for two years after I was born my father came here.
01:30
He was one of the first English taught teachers, he taught in the Philippines and
01:35
then a mere year after my mother followed.
01:39
So I was left behind there, I have an elder sister who was with my
01:45
maternal grandparents and I was with my paternal grandparents.
01:51
So I grew up with
01:54
my paternal grandparents and they were farmers.
01:57
My sister, well my grandparents, maternal grandparents were clerks
02:04
so we are different lifestyles.
02:06
So
02:08
I grew up in a farm.
02:09
In a farm.
02:10
And when your parents went to the United States where did they go to, what state?
02:16
Here in Oregon.
02:18
May I ask why they chose Oregon?
02:21
Because my big brother of my mother was ahead, he was here so he followed suit.
02:31
So there was work available here?
02:33
Yes, they, they, they work here in Oregon.
02:37
And so how long did you live with your grandparents?
02:41
Well, up to, well before I came here I was with them.
02:46
That was in 1950,
02:51
1948, something like that.
02:54
Okay and then was the plan that your parents would bring you and
02:58
your sister to the United States, that was the original plan?
03:01
It was the plan, you know what, after the war, well I applied because during,
03:06
at the end of the war or at the start of the war I was fourth year of high
03:12
school and I should be going to college.
03:16
So
03:19
after the war, that was in 1942 I think, 43, I applied, but I was denied because
03:25
high school I should be going to college.
03:28
It was our plan that I will, that I was accepted by the University of
03:32
Portland and the several colleges here, but I was denied because they
03:38
said that the immigration always said in Manila said that the, “no you are
03:43
not coming back to the Philippines” - in spite of the fact that my parents, my
03:48
father and mother and I have a younger brother born here; I was denied.
03:53
So I started in the Philippines instead of coming here.
03:56
I took my college in the Philippines.
03:59
Okay, and what was that like?
04:01
Can you describe your experience?
04:04
Well, well I really enjoyed staying there in a way because
04:11
denied coming here, I was forced to start in Manila in the Philippines and
04:17
Manila then was devastated by the war.
04:21
It was, so many houses were destroyed and I stayed there for
04:27
four years, but I was so lucky that before graduation I landed a job.
04:33
I applied
04:36
for a job at the Philippine National Bank, so before I graduated, I
04:43
was to graduate April, and I was taken in by the bank - that was
04:50
January for about four months ahead.
04:55
So I found work there and I was so lucky to have work at the Philippine
05:00
National Bank because I was offered so many, scholarships, training, and even
05:06
I started to take my master’s degree program in economics at the UO, you know
05:13
when I was with the bank and I had a training with the First National Bank,
05:17
the predecessor of the Wells Fargo now.
05:20
That was in 1963, but 1952 I was here to attend the funeral of my brother.
05:31
Because my brother he was a scholar or a head of the in the Oregon State
05:37
College at the university, yet in Engineering, but he was called to
05:42
service and he joined the First Marine Division that served duty in the,
05:51
during the
05:54
Korean War.
05:54
And he wrote me, “Well, after the war I’ll be passing by to see you.”
05:59
I haven’t seen him, but then I heard that there was a report that he was
06:06
wounded and then he said oh I’m tired of staying in the hospital, I have to
06:10
go back with my comrades in the front.
06:13
He went there to the front during the Chinese offensive, so he was killed there.
06:18
And during his funeral here in Tillamook, well I had to come to attend and
06:24
that was the time when I was allowed to come to the, the first time.
06:32
Okay.
06:32
First time to come to the United States and first time to, and
06:34
it was an experience, you know.
06:37
First time to come here, well in the Philippines, you know you can’t really
06:38
wear a suit, I was in a light suit with
06:46
the combination shoes and then when
06:49
we were landing, we couldn’t land in Portland because it was snowy
06:55
and the plane cannot land here so we land, we landed at the Boeing
07:00
Airfield in Seattle [laughs].
07:02
So when I landed
07:04
from the plane on the tarmac, a couple, old couple said, “Oh young man, fresh
07:11
from the Philippines?” I noticed that my attire should somewhat black or dark
07:17
and my shoes was combination [laughs].
07:20
So, “Oh yes sir” I said, that was my first experience here and then
07:25
also I stayed with my uncle here in Portland on Corbett Ave. and you know
07:31
what in the Philippines we usually in the early in the morning you wear
07:36
pajamas you are looking for a [?] over
07:46
there in the states in pajamas [laughs]. And morning we have to have
07:46
breakfast so I went down from bed, I
07:52
was in the attic, I’m still in the attic went down and Corbett Ave is there, I
07:55
was in pajamas and I saw my uncle out
08:00
there [laughs] you know.
08:02
It was so strict before and
08:08
then unlike the, unlike now that you can wear anything, go in the street, you can
08:14
drive with your, not in full clothes, very strict before, very formal before.
08:21
So for your brother’s funeral was the first time that you came to Oregon?
08:26
What was the experience like here?
08:28
Then were you able to stay or did you go back to the Philippines?
08:31
Oh I had to go back, I just attended the funeral and service of my
08:35
brother and then one, and then the funeral was done in Tillamook.
08:42
That
08:44
was very cold, it was
08:51
January I think, January and it was so cold.
08:53
We stayed in the attic in Tillamook, oh
09:03
my gosh [laughs].
09:03
I then I was to get married, January I was to get married in May.
09:07
In the Philippines?
09:08
In the Philippines and my two aunties that is the wife of my wife’s of my
09:16
uncles, we went shopping for a gown, wedding gown and then, you know what
09:23
they sold me - and then my aunty said, “Simeon don’t pick your nose in public
09:35
[laughs]. But it
09:37
was so formal before, very strict. And then one time also I said,
09:43
“Oh Simeon you buy dancing shoes” [laughs] yeah, experiences.
09:51
So you returned to the Philippines?
09:53
I returned to finish with my job.
09:55
Your job, with the bank?
09:56
With the bank and then well
10:01
1963, that was 1952 when I first came; here in 1963, 64 I got another
10:07
leave from the Philippines National Bank where I had a study leave.

11:08
So how long were you here, a year or two years?
11:10
A year, yeah.
11:11

11:15
I went back and then I had several seminars and I, they sent me again
11:21

13:16
My, my eldest was a girl, she’s a nurse, she’s now a head nurse at the American
13:24
Hospital in [?] , but he was also, he came here to train in the United States
13:31

14:23
Then my third is in the Philippines, no, my fourth is in the Philippines,
14:26

So every time I go home to the Philippines I have,
14:39
I have two houses there: duplex, the other one is vacant, the original house
14:45
is vacant, it’s full of [?] boxes, you know [?] boxes, twenty boxes.

So you came here to study, to the United States, did you want to
15:48
move your family here to the United States permanently, is that something
15:52
that you and your family wanted?
15:54
Well, you know it’s sort of a good thing to come to the United States for the kids,
16:03
you know, because well for better life.
16:07
I think its worth, so many people want to come here anyway so.
16:16
So did you eventually move your family here?
16:20
Yeah, yeah.
16:20
To Oregon, when was that?
16:22

16:24
Oh, that was several years ago, I cannot remember.
16:27
My, well it will be three of them, two sons and my daughter, who came here
16:35
and the two are in Saudi Arabia and they are in Qatar and the third of the
16:42
six one is in the Philippines taking care of my, my, my properties there
16:47

16:52
So your children they came here to study, to, to receive an education?
16:57
Is that why they came?
16:58
No, no they came here for a living.
17:01
For a living, okay.
17:02
So the whole family came?
17:03
Yeah.
17:03
Okay.
17:04
Well my two sons, they are
17:08
single, not married.
17:09
My daughter who is, who is married.
17:12
So was that in the 1970s, the 1980s, around what time period
17:18
was it that the family came?
17:21
Well my daughter came here, 80, 90s.
17:25
In the 90s, 1990s?
17:28
Yeah, so my son 90s, yes because I came here 1984.
17:36
I petitioned them in the early 90s they were here.
17:39
Okay, so you came in 1984?
17:42
Pardon.
17:43
You came in 1984?
17:45
1984.
17:45
Okay.
17:45
It’s so, I’m so lucky really because I had retired in the Philippines, in
17:49
the Philippines National Bank in April,
17:54
oh no, March.
17:55
April I am here already.
17:57
Oh okay.
17:57
Here, just within a month.
18:00
It’s so timely.
18:02
And then you know what, my experience here when I
18:09
arrive, I went to banks, Bank of America, First National Bank and they
18:10
said, “No, you are over qualified.” Yeah, I was, I didn’t work in a bank
18:16
or in any clerical job so I applied.
18:22
I went
18:27
to [?] here in Delta Park.
18:27
Okay.
18:29
No vacancy, but then there were Filipinas, oh no Filipina,
18:34
Filipino girls working there.
18:37
“Oh mano,” they said, “there’s a job here.” I went, oh you start now and so
18:44
you, you did collection too [laughs].
18:47
And then the vice president of the bank, the First National Bank where
18:54
I attend here has a cousin who has a plant in, somewhere in, in Marine Drive.
19:03
So I went there, I worked there.
19:05
I was the secretary, I was the telephone operator, I was the book keeper, and
19:13
everything in the office.
19:14
And then I found out,
19:17
you know, I found out that, I saw the books.
19:20
There were purchases that were ghosts something so I reported.
19:22
Now I said
19:32
this is overpriced, there is no check or there was no editing.
19:37
I reported so, but then fearing that I might be harmed, I left the, the job.
19:45
And again, I went to
19:51
parking Amco, parking at the airport.
19:54
So I could not find any job
19:58
whatsoever so I come in or I can’t live here.
19:59
So I was assigned in there and then they was assigned as park checker
20:06
and then finally I was assigned as the auditor, you know what?
20:13
At the long parking, I found out that two girls, ladies, tailors
20:25
there, businessmen one month they stay, they have to pay one hundred dollars, two
20:30
hundred dollars and then I saw they are staying to eat and then it invalidates,
20:32
they invalidated after that payment.
20:32
There were several so I noticed, oh my gosh they must have, if you pay
20:34
me cash now, you leave I get the cash and I don’t report it there and then
20:35
I invalidate the payment, the whole payment, there were several of this.
20:35
So, so I, those two girls were dismissed, but no charges because
20:35
the money has been said that if we don’t charge, I think that it said
20:35
that they can no longer find a job.
20:40
So they, they are so kind to us, so considerate too.
20:49
So in
21:18
1984 when you came did you come by yourself?
21:20
Yeah.
21:21
You came by yourself and how many years were you here by yourself?
21:27
Oh
21:31
about, no I was, I was with my, was
21:37
I with
21:41
my wife, I came, I could not remember.
21:42
I was with my wife and then we went to, yeah I was with my wife.
21:44
Okay.
21:45
And then we went home for the marriage of my, one
21:53
of my children, my girls.
21:56
And then I left my wife there because my wife has some heart problem.
22:02
That was October, I left October 15, my wife there, but then she show me at the
22:12
airport with her brother and from the airport I learned that, that she went
22:17
to the hospital because of a weak heart.
22:22
And then while there, she died so I
22:31
have to go back end of October, but it probably began October it’s
22:32
All Saints Day so it’s difficult to take a flight because everybody
22:37
is going home in the Philippines.
22:39
That’s the, because All Saints Day that stay in the Philippines is
22:42
November 1st, so people have to go home
22:48
to visit their, their family, family members.
22:48
So yeah,
22:52
my, my wife, my first wife died, the mother of my six children.
23:00
And then that was 86, 87 because [?] was in the high school in the
23:06
Philippines, in the high school.
23:08
There is only one high school, its 25 kilometers away from my town.
23:14
I have to go to that high school there, public high school.
23:18
And I boarded, I had to board in house across the high school.
23:24
It’s the, that house is owned by my wife now.
23:29
Well we had some, you know relationship or friendship and then
23:36
I had to, the sister wrote her, oh Julita, that’s my first wife, died.
23:41
So we communicated, she’s a PhD in Chemistry,
23:48
she worked, she have money.
23:50
So she learned about that and said, “Oh do you want to come to Europe?” So I
23:58
went to Europe, she brought me around.
24:02
Went to Luxemburg, all around, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Germany.
24:04
She worked in, in Germany with one
24:13
of the biggest pharmaceutical firms there and then I
24:21
came back here, she followed suit and we got married [laughs].
24:24
Okay, so you were married here and was this in the late 80s or early 1990s?
24:28
87, 87.
24:29
87, okay.
24:30
It was 87.
24:31
And then, you two, have you lived here ever since?
24:34
Yeah.
24:34
Okay.
24:36
That’s, she’s with me and we are old.
24:40
We,
24:44
and it so happens, you know when I was here in early 19,
24:48
when I came here, 84, 85, yeah.
24:52
I was boarding somewhere here near Lloyd Center, I was paying around,
24:59
how much was it, two hundred plus or four hundred and then I learned that
25:05
the house was vacant or for sale in Corbett Ave. just across the house where
25:12
I stayed my first time coming here.
25:15
So I went to that old couple and said, “Oh how much, you know house is” $25,000 and
25:26
then they said, the old couple said, “Oh can you pay, can you put a down payment
25:26
of $5,000?””Yeah I will try” I said.
25:26
I don’t, “How much can you pay monthly?” “Well it’s up to you,
25:26
you’re the one selling” I said.
25:27
“Oh can you offer two hundred?” [laughs] – Okay.
25:27
So I had that small house, it’s the old, the first settlement in Portland, but
25:27
that was in Corbett Ave. It’s a very how small houses with verandas so and then
25:27
after that both couple, they are old,
25:30
these
25:38
are old people across, across a neighborhood, then they died and
25:39
the one who inherited was a, an adoptive daughter from Washington.
25:39
Oh I said I don’t want to deal with
25:45
individuals so
26:25
I had the house mortgaged with a
26:30
bank.
26:31
The bank paid the one who inherited so I’m dealing with the bank not
26:36
really a person, so, so that’s it, that’s how I purchased my house.
26:42
Okay, so let’s talk a little bit about your connection
26:46
to the Asian Family Center?
26:48
Oh yeah.
26:49
So were you connected with the AFC since the beginning in the 1990s?
26:57
Were you connected with the?
26:58
You, you, you know what at the time there were so many organizations:
27:02
APANO, Filipino organizations, I was all involved with them.
27:08
Okay, well can you talk a little bit about that?
27:10
So when you moved here, you became really involved with the community
27:13
and you wanted to help the community?
27:16
Almost all organizations during the Philippine American Chamber
27:20
of Commerce, I was in there.
27:22
The senior’s coalition, I
27:27
was there.
27:28
AFC, I was there, almost all organizations I got involved in the organizational part
27:36
during the time when they were organized.
27:40
So I got involved and then you know before AFC was independent,
27:46
we are not part of IRCO.
27:49
So, well it’s good because AFC being part of IRCO now is
27:56
an arm of IRCO.
27:57
Well can you talk a little bit about that “before” time period?
28:03
Yeah, before that well we had to, we had several meetings and then we supported
28:10
that the schools for, is that Sunday school, that they have extensions
28:15
for younger kids, but I was, I just questioned that because I said well
28:23
the kids that we are talking to now have been here for ten years or so.
28:27
They have undergone all the steps toward higher education and all those
28:34
born here, they have done their goal, the regular educational system I said.
28:40
We do have to do this, but still AFC supported that.
28:47
Yeah there was so many changes here at the AFC.
28:53
Old faces, they are gone, I am the only one perhaps who is left behind,
28:56
with Hongsa, Lee Po Cha [laughs].
29:00
So what did you do with the Asian Family Center, how, were you a board
29:04
member at the beginning and were you?
29:06
Yeah, board member since the very beginning.
29:08
Since the very beginning?
29:09
Yeah.
29:09
So that was in the, the early 90s.
29:16
Yeah.
29:16
So 1992, 93, 94?
29:17
Yeah, I remember now what ages it was organized.
29:20
So since, since the early 90s you’ve been a board member, so what have you done as
29:24
a board member, what, what’s your role?
29:26
Well, you know as a board member you are a, the board is the policy
29:30
meeting office for any organization.
29:35
We develop a programs, we see to it that these programs are being done and that’s
29:47
how we as a board member, we, we just put up the plans and then the stuff we’ll have
29:54
to take over.
29:58
So far everything is okay and then we had at one time we had fundraising, we had a
30:10
celebration to, well we gave certificates to, award certificates to members,
30:15
to community, supporters, yeah it’s,
30:24
and then it’s good because it was taken over by a partner
30:30
of IRCO, it’s better off.
30:31
With
30:33
IRCO and then the Asian Family Center as an arm in putting up
30:40
its programs, it’s very good.
30:45
What do you consider your successes?
30:48
So what are you proud of that, that the Asian Family Center has accomplished?
30:52
Well, well you know I am very proud because I am part of the Asian
30:57
organization and the good thing for this is, as part of one organization from
31:07
the government or whatever the governor says we have to convey to our people.
31:12
And through the Asian Family Center, whatever policies we making, we
31:16
have to convey to our followers, our members in the community.
31:20
We are the go between, sort of, that, that’s the rule that we have.
31:22
Whatever problems or
31:24
whatever good
31:28
things for the
31:30
community, we get it from the government down to Asian Family Center, Asian
31:39
Family to our constituents and whatever problems our constituents have,
31:43
we are the people to convey to the government, it’s sort of like that.
31:49
So what are some of the problems, what are some of the needs of
31:53
the Asian community in Oregon?
31:57
I, I, I don’t have any
32:03
so far, so far.
32:05
So when you first began, what were some of the services that the community
32:09
needed, did they need job placement, did they need English language training?
32:15
Yeah, yeah English language training.
32:18
So that was one of the things you offered?
32:20
Because you know, we are new here especially, so well
32:24
Filipinos not so much no
32:28
problem about English because English is our sort of second national language.
32:36
All schools in the Philippines have no problem, but for those
32:40
newcomers from other countries
32:45
well they, they have a problem about well English so there is that
32:52
program then about teaching English,
32:57
extra class in English and then we also have a neighborhood.
33:07
Well we were also involved with Hongsa, Lee Po Cha in that Asian Law Enforcement
33:14
Council before, with the police.
33:18
We were part of that, there was an organization, but it,
33:24
it’s no longer operational so what we did before because gang, gangster issue
33:29
before was so rampant, especially so with the other communities, so what.
33:38
So there was a gang problem with the youth, with the, with the young people?
33:43
Yeah, yeah before yeah.
33:43
So what did the Asian Family Center do to try and address that?
33:47
Well we as a Asian Family Center we have to convey, we have to inform
33:52
our people the right things to do.
33:55
If we note our, we see people doing this and this we have to report it
34:01
right away to forestall or stop any
34:07
further damage or crime to be done, yeah.
34:10
That’s, if I remember right,
34:15
there was several killings before, you know.
34:20
People could not adjust so that’s how
34:28
it all, whatever the government says or any problem that the
34:32
government has to do, convey to
34:38
us, we convey to our people.
34:39
We are a neighborhood, sort of a neighborhood gatherings or consultations.
34:41
We have to impart to our people during our meetings if I am a member with
34:45
another, I am a member the Philippine Organization, during our meeting I
34:46
have to tell them, this is the problem.
34:46
So that’s, we are the
34:54
go between or information dissemination, that’s what we do, so it’s very effective.
35:01
So what other programs have you or services have you been involved
35:07
with especially with the youth other than the gang prevention
35:11
services, what else have you done?
35:13
Well we, I am also a part of the Seniors Coalition.
35:17
Seniors Coalition?
35:18
Seniors Coalition, we have that, vaccinations and then
35:22
we all of our old people.
35:22
Whatever problem they have, we try to help them, I remember, I remember the board
35:42
also, since it began, we organized too that the Asian Pacific
35:48
American Seniors Coalition.
35:51
I remember the vote and we have a meeting now that with [?] we are
35:58
coordinating with the [?] where we fit the old people [laughs].
36:03
So and then about
36:28
health, vaccinations, we contact this vaccination people.
36:29
So that’s all, [?] - before oh my
36:34
gosh it was rampant the gangster issue, the young people.
36:36
It’s good because.
36:38
Can you talk a little bit about why, why that was occurring, why
36:42
there was such an increase in?
36:44
Yeah, yeah I don’t know why, I don’t know why,
36:49
before I don’t know.
36:52
So that’s why the Asian Law Enforcement Council was created.
36:54
It was of this, now if what
36:58
we
37:01
do if I notice something or I heard something or got information
37:07
telling about our community, I report it right away and you know
37:12
especially for the Philippine people.
37:15
If you talk about a family, something bad about a family it’s a disgrace so as
37:23
much as, as much as possible we families in the Filipino community, we try our
37:29
best to show off, no, no nothing, but once anything bad about your family your
37:35
whole community knows you’re, oh you’re
37:42
down, so we try our best to be good, to protect ourselves the right way, so.
37:52
Is it, the Filipino community here, is it unified?
37:56
Do people help one another?
37:58
Oh yes, yes.
37:58
Yeah, you know our Filipino community here, I started, I am almost part we
38:06
have you know there was one Filipino community only – we have a building here,
38:11
have you, have you been there before?
38:12
No.
38:13
At the start and the 89th we have cultural building there so and then
38:23
well there was one Filipino community, now we have regional if you come from another
38:45
region
38:51
because you speak another language there, well there we have 14
38:55
Filipino organizations here.
38:55
14?
38:55
In Oregon, in Oregon, but in here we have around 5 I think.
38:57
This is regional, from one island to another because one island in
38:58
the Philippines you speak another language, another vernacular [laughs].
38:58
Although universal it’s English, we understood, but
39:04
some communities they have their own, their own language or yeah.
39:12
So that’s how we had, we just had our
39:20
picnic last July 4th at Blue Lake.
39:23
Almost all Filipino organizations are there and I’m very much
39:28
involved because I have lots of display boards, binders, [laughs]
39:37
yeah.
39:38
So we are, we are enjoying and what else more?
39:47
So how have you seen the community change?
39:50
You’ve lived here for many, many years.
39:53
Oh, many, many years.
39:53
Thirty years, how have you seen the changes or have things
39:58
stayed the same in terms of
40:02
what people need?
40:02
You know the changes they are so many faces are not in public anymore [laughs].
40:07
So, so many in organizations, I think there are I am an avid photographer.
40:15
My house is full of photographs, of pictures so much so that I find
40:20
myself that I have to review, review I find it I say look at the TV I am
40:25
growing my pictures and so many faces I can no longer, I no longer
40:26
with us during parties, you know.
40:26
I don’t know, I’m not, not myself because myself would name
40:26
every party I am there [laughs].
40:26
So I don’t know, we, we are doing fine because as I see that
40:26
somebody dies, we are all there.
40:26
During parties we are all there, we help, especially myself every party that I
40:26
am there so I know what’s happening in
41:09
the community, so.
41:11
So you mentioned that you returned to the Philippines, you have two houses in
41:15
the Philippines and you return often.
41:18
In the Filipino community is that common, do other families also go back
41:24
and forth between the United States
41:28
and the Philippines?
41:28
Oh, yes, yes, yes, as much as possible, as, as long as they can afford, you know.
41:31
That they have to go home, yeah.
41:34
It’s, it’s nice to be in there,
41:45
to be with your old ties and in the Philippines everything is very
41:46
cheap, you know, that’s why I’m going
41:52
home again in September [laughs], you know.
41:54
Last, last year I have this year I went to we are, we are
41:59
talking about $52,200 dollars.
42:02
Oh my god, I haven’t seen that money [laughs] so I went home
42:07
and then they just, it was in in a hurry, so it cost around $800.
42:14
So healthcare is much less expensive in the Philippines?
42:20
I am, I am to go back this September to have this fixed again [laughs].
42:24
I know I, I’m still, I still gain in my fare.
42:30
So let’s talk a little bit more about the Asian Family Center, you mentioned
42:36
the, the vaccination, so the health services that the AFC provides,
42:40
senior services, youth services, what else have you done with the board?
42:46
What other things have you worked on?
42:48
Well, as I said, whatever problems we have with our communities, we have to
42:56
inform them during all of our meetings.
42:58
So what I would, if I informed them on what I would solutions or
43:05
whatever measures of what
43:09
could be done to alleviate or whatever in a situation.
43:11
That’s what
43:16
we do, we are the go between as I said.
43:19
That’s good for this Asian Family Center since its very beginning, so.
43:25
So what, can you give an example of what’s happening right now, so the
43:29
needs of the community right now, so at the board meetings what have you
43:33
talked about that the community needs?
43:36
I, I cannot remember what was the last meeting that we
43:41
had; about…I could not recall [laughs].
43:50
In general, this past, this past year what types of things have you discussed?
43:56
Well, during past year we have all this education for the children.
44:01
Oh, education for the children, okay.
44:03
Education for the children that’s what we, that’s what we talk about.
44:07
So connecting with the local schools?
44:09
Yeah, that’s through the local schools, yeah.
44:14
And what
44:19
else - more about
44:29
health, about education, about community, leadership, about, about our
44:32
relationship with the city hall who is
44:35
helping us, yeah.
44:39
Can you talk a little bit about that, the relationship with, with city hall,
44:43
the relationship with the government?
44:45
Can you talk a little bit about that?
44:45
Yeah, because our funding well, you know it comes from them [laughs] and that’s
44:51
very important to support that program, whatever programs the government has they
44:56
give it to us, we, we implement them we help them more and that’s how it, the
45:05
relationship that we maintained.
45:09
Good relationship with the city government so, this is APANO now,
45:18
we were there last week about deciding about the education, learning
45:26
and we had our picture taken with Governor Brown, we were there.
45:29
So yeah it
45:36
was there, we represent the community in the whole set up that’s
45:43
so we are visible – that’s very important, the Asian community.
45:49
People know that we are active, that we are there always in any event.
45:55
I think that’s a big role that we play.
45:57
So you would describe it as a good relationship, a good working relationship,
46:02
that the government listens to you?
46:03
Yes, of course, of course yeah.
46:06
And I was also,
46:08
last year, or yeah more than one year, I was a member of the
46:12
Commission of Asian Affairs.
46:15
I was a commissioner too, like Hongsa, I was a commissioner,
46:20
the first commissioner.
46:21
What did that do, the Commission for Asian Affairs, what was the role of that?
46:25
Okay, well the same thing, whatever problems we have, we have to inform
46:31
the government, the governor, because that is under the office
46:34
of the governor, the Commission of
46:37
Asian Affairs.
46:39
And we are approved as a member; our appointments are approved by the
46:49
legislative branch so what problems we have in our communities we convey
46:55
to the government, the governor, yeah.
46:55
So there are
47:02
a lot of organizations that assist Asian and Pacific Islanders do
47:07
they all work together do you find, those different organizations?
47:12
I, yeah because under IRCO we have the African House and then they send families
47:21
in there and then here came also people from Europe: Hungary most of Eastern
47:23
Europe, yeah they are here, Africans are
47:32
here, Asians are here, so we are all over represented by various
47:40
areas: African, Asian, Mexican.
47:41
So we are
47:52
well represented in the government.
47:55
So what do you most enjoy about being a board member for the Asian Family Center?
48:01
Well first of all, individual, personal,
48:09
it’s so nice to look people not in your own community, just imagine,
48:14
knowing people from various countries, then we have to visit.
48:21
Well I’ve been going around all over, the only thing that I haven’t
48:26
done, I haven’t gone to Vietnam, but that’s my plan; I want to go there.
48:31
Vietnam, Cambodia, also Burma, but I’ve been all over, so
48:38
it’s so nice to be with people.
48:41
So the board is very diverse, it’s very representative.
48:45
Oh yeah.
48:45
Of the type of people in the community?
48:47
Oh yes, yes.
48:49
Yeah, we
48:53
have Vietnamese,
48:59
Thailander, I’m the only Filipino there.
49:00
You are the only Filipino representative?
49:02
I am the only Filipino, yeah.
49:04
Has that changed over the years?
49:06
You’ve been a board member for 20 years or so, has that always been the case or?
49:11
[laughs] Yeah, I have been always.
49:14
I don’t know why, in every organization I am the only one left.
49:20
I don’t know if the, the Chamber of Commerce, the same thing.
49:24
So many people,
49:27
I don’t know, I stick around [laughs].
49:31
Has the Filipino population increased or decreased?
49:35
Oh, yes, yes.
49:35
It’s increased in these last few years.
49:36
You know what,
49:39
before we have our own eleven thousand here in Oregon and Southwest Washington
49:49
and there were only two counties with no Filipino residents, but right now there
49:54
are so many and you know they love Oregon.
49:59
You know there are so many coming from the East, they migrated here and
50:05
so with California they come here.
50:07
I perhaps, yeah I
50:12
think the state of Oregon is a very ideal place, not so, not so
50:18
many hurricanes, not so many storms [laughs], not so hot, no fires, you
50:31
know what I say.
50:32
California storms, hurricanes, tornado, but here,
50:37
it’s so nice, beautiful Oregon, yeah.
50:39
It’s an ideal place, so many, many Filipinos have come here so all over,
50:50
like Filipinos they are all over the
50:55
world, you can see Filipinos all over the world [laughs].
50:58
So can you talk a little bit about your ideas and your recommendations for the
51:03
Asian Family Center, what would you like for the Asian Family Center to do?
51:07
Well as I said, well the Asian Family Center should stay as an organization well
51:13
to support, to promote, and well to see to it that our livelihood here as Asians or
51:27
other communities will cooperate, will be together, enjoy life, and I think get
51:35
the most out of it, of our stay here, and to work hard for the government,
51:44
for all of us, for the community.
51:47
It’s for the community, its welfare that is our aim, for
51:55
the betterment of the community, better relationships.
51:59
That’s one thing more, at least my stay here with the Asian Family Center
52:02
I know we are friends with Hongsa, with Lee Po Cha, with everybody.
52:05
So it’s so nice, you enlarge your knowledge or
52:13
your
52:19
connection with other people, that’s very important.
52:24
If you have problems, we inform,
52:29
perhaps they
52:32
help me, it’s helping one another, cooperating with one and another
52:35
for a better community of course.
52:39
That’s the main aim, for a better community isn’t it?
52:43
Livable community.
52:46
That’s the main aim for these organizations
52:52
anyway, better community, better understanding, better cooperation for
52:56
a better result, better life for all of us.
53:00
I think that’s the main aim of being a community member, I think, you contribute
53:07
with the best interest of everybody,
53:11
that’s how we live, do the best you can.
53:15
So you mentioned that, you mentioned the Asian Pacific
53:19
American Network of Oregon, APANO?
53:21
Yeah.
53:21
You mentioned the Filipino American Chamber of Commerce.
53:28
You mentioned the Commission of Asian Affairs, what other, you mentioned that
53:34
you are involved in a lot, what other organizations are you involved in?
53:39
I have the list - I am a national, this is national.
53:41
I am
53:47
a member of the Federation of Filipino American Chamber of Commerce, I am the
53:57
secretary.
53:57
This is throughout the United States, last year we had a mission, a trip and
54:03
investment mission in the Philippines.
54:06
Its, we promote the trade between
54:27
the US, us and the Philippines.
54:29
We went there to several, several provinces and we, we there were
54:30
memorandums of agreements that about, about trade between the
54:31
US, us and the Philippines.
54:31
And then I’m a member of the NFFAO that is a national organization also that
54:38
is the National Federation of Filipino American Associations or Organizations.
54:44
I, I am the chair for the state of Oregon, there are,
54:49
we are in region
54:53
7: Washington,
54:55
Alaska and here in Oregon, but that’s the NFFAO, we are the convention
55:00
in the Philippines they are
55:06
[?] and then I’m member of the Philippine National Historical Society.
55:12
The Filipino American National, I was the president for seven
55:16
years and I’m still a member.
55:18
My wife is a member, a member of the board of trustees.
55:23
So this is the historical society?
55:25
So all the culture, the history?
55:28
Oh history.
55:30
Is that?
55:30
You, you know what?
55:32
The, the Philippines
55:35
it was Manila and then, then here came the United States because the
55:43
American ship in Maine, they named Maine, that’s a warship was bumped by
55:52
Spaniards in Cuba that’s why the Fili, the Americans came
55:57
to the United, to the Philippines and they took over the Philippines.
56:02
We were under the United States there so that’s how I, we speak English in there.
56:09
That’s our relationship with the, with the United States.
56:14
So in that historic – and then we have the early Filipinos who came
56:20
here, it was so long, long time ago.
56:24
First Filipinos arriving, they were the ones who they build the ships
56:28
in California, oh early, early Filipinos, many, many Filipinos.
56:35
So who came here, even before the 1500s, then I am a member also of the NFFAO.
56:39
Oh I cannot remember now, there’s so many organizations.
56:40
I am a board member of the Chamber of Commerce; I am member,
56:53
formerly board member of
56:57
the Filipino Association here.
56:58
We have a senior’s coalition as
57:01
I
57:03
said for the, the Asian, Asian Family
57:07
Center.
57:07
Oh, lots of organizations that I am a member.
57:14
So in the, in the Philippines when you lived there before coming here, before
57:19
the 1980s, were you also involved a lot in community organizations?
57:24
Oh yes.
57:25
Yes.
57:25
So you’ve been involved all, most of your life, you’ve always wanted to be
57:29
involved with community organizations?
57:30
Yeah, we have one organization there in the Philippines and during town
57:37
fiestas we have our own show just to inform the people that we are active
57:53
coming so we do well in the Philippines, you know.
57:57
Almost every month there is a town fiesta, town celebration in honor of
58:04
our saint because during the Spanish time, Catholicism was introduced there
58:10
so almost always you are all Catholics except in middle where the Muslims
58:14
are, in Luzon, Visayas, we are well 90% are Catholic, Roman Catholic or
58:25
Christian in the Philippines.
58:26
So every month we have a town fiesta celebration, where we honor
58:34
our saint because every town has its own saint, one saint, like
58:41
that.
58:42
So December 10 in our towns, so we have programs, we sponsor one
58:49
night for that celebration, lots of food, every house decorated, and
58:57
in the Philippines especially so.
59:00
During Christmas time, it’s very colorful, all over the state
59:04
you can see lanterns, all over.
59:08
It’s so beautiful, so I like to
59:12
go to the Philippines every December, very colorful, people
59:14
shouting there [laughs] so.
59:20
APANO that’s a, I remember of NFFAO, that’s the National Federation Filipino
59:24
American Organization in the national and then the historical society.
59:24
And in Asia
59:34
well you have the Asian Pacific American Seniors Coalition and I am,
59:40
I am one of the organizers there too.
59:43
APANO and I am one, I am one of the organizers.
59:47
Well local, the chamber of commerce - and so I was also a member of that
59:53
in Salem, the association in Salem.
59:58
I’m a member, I’m a member I was a member, board member too and then
1:00:02
we have that seniors in Vancouver, I was a board member there too.
1:00:11
I don’t know I, I have so many organizations, I have time.
1:00:15
Do you, do you think that these organizations are enough, do you
1:00:19
think that there perhaps is a need that hasn’t been met, is there, is
1:00:24
there more to be done in your opinion?
1:00:27
Well at least in one way or another they, they serve the community and
1:00:36
right now I was a, I am also a member and all they collect are permanent
1:00:47
estates of the council of Filipino organizations throughout Oregon.
1:00:52
We have a, there are 14 Filipino organizations in Oregon and I was
1:00:58
one of the founders, I was one of the first signers [laughs].
1:01:02
I am [?] old timer [laughs] so we’ll have a convention here this September,
1:01:12
September 5, but then it coincides, you know I am the secretary of the
1:01:13
Federation of Chamber of Commerce and we have the convention in Las
1:01:13
Vegas, 4, 5, 6 September 4, 5, 6
1:01:16
. Oh.
1:01:16
And then the council will have Saturday and I talked with IRCO because
1:01:24
well
1:01:37
I went to IRCO, we are
1:01:41
renting that place at IRCO, that center, that community center, that building.
1:01:48
We’ll be using that on the 5th of September, I don’t know where
1:01:54
to go if I have to go to Las Vegas or I stay here [laughs].
1:01:58
I don’t know, there’s so many, so that’s the problem, my problem.
1:02:06
You’re involved so much.
1:02:08
So how do you prioritize, how do you decide what organization
1:02:11
to support at what time?
1:02:12
Yeah,
1:02:15
yeah it’s so difficult because I have to speak too, about something,
1:02:18
about this immigration of 1985,
1:02:23
where before it’s so restrictive, Filipinos coming here, but with that new
1:02:31
law, immigration law of 1985, it allows next of kin or military connections
1:02:37
or something like that, but before.
1:02:40
This is, this is a federal?
1:02:42
An influx of Filipinos coming.
1:02:43
Oh okay.
1:02:44
This was a federal law, national law?
1:02:46
Yeah.
1:02:47
1984, 1985, around the time that you came?
1:02:51
So I was requested to as a,
1:02:58
since I came here I am a part of that program, of that law, so they
1:03:05
ask me to speak, but then I am also some investment in Las Vegas, I don’t know.
1:03:13
And then the following, that’s 4, 5, 6, on the 9th I’ll be leaving
1:03:18
for the Philippines [laughs].
1:03:20
Oh, that’s right.
1:03:21
So I don’t know, so.
1:03:25
So you returned to the Philippines, you mentioned at the beginning
1:03:29
of the interview that you give necessary goods to the children,
1:03:36
especially and, and families there.
1:03:39
You mentioned that you have a house full of boxes with.
1:03:42
Oh, yeah.
1:03:43
Can you talk a little bit about that?
1:03:44
You know, almost one every two years, but lately last year,
1:03:52
twice we are on a medical mission.
1:03:52
I, I, I’m the honorary advisor to the president of the [?] that is
1:04:02
a, a organization of a region in the Philippines.
1:04:07
They are something that every year, and I was one of the founders too,
1:04:10
and I am the advisor to the president.
1:04:13
I am always involved, I hope, I have lots of pictures every time, I
1:04:19
have those banners, every time I go home I prepare banners, pictures.
1:04:25
I show them so we have to in these medical missions, I have to go there.
1:04:32
And then aside from that, aside from the medical point, there is a program
1:04:38
from, there are so many children in the Philippines who are, I don’t
1:04:45
know, health wise they are aust, is it autistic, seem to be blind,
1:04:53
hearing and so I give them backpacks.
1:04:57
If they are still here, pencils, pens, old clothes, some friends they give me
1:05:03
old clothes, or new clothes or whatever.
1:05:06
I, there is a program where this year, children with deformities – while people
1:05:13
are waiting to be served medically there
1:05:20
is a program where
1:05:20
these kids in the Philippines, they are around 30 or 50 of them
1:05:20
are like semi blind, autistic, so
1:05:26
many.
1:05:27
So my niece, who is the
1:05:34
head, uncle is head, “can you bring us some soccer balls?” - so I, I last
1:05:40
time I went there I have, I have some pictures where I give backpacks, pens.
1:05:47
I give these kids happy program, they do dancing, singing, guitar so just
1:05:55
to give a little help. So that’s what I do, while the medical mission is
1:06:01
being performed all around there is a program and then sometimes oh yes
1:06:07
its closed, all the old people run for
1:06:12
[laughs].
1:06:12
It’s very interesting
1:06:15
and then you give people, they’re old, they hug you, you just
1:06:19
give them 100 pesos, 100 pesos just to let us, or just 50.
1:06:25
You just give them a little bit of money, oh they hug you.
1:06:29
And then during the trade mission that’s what I did in, in one of the provinces
1:06:35
in the Philippines lately, last year.
1:06:38
There was a, a group of people from the mountains, in
1:06:47
the mountain,
1:06:50
it’s so difficult to go there so they came down, they had a group
1:06:55
singing for us during the mission.
1:06:58
So I have lots of dollar bills, well I give it to the overhead, but
1:07:05
then they said that he, she will give it to the head of that group.
1:07:10
Oh no, I said he will just give them a little cup of
1:07:14
coffee, give me back the money.
1:07:17
So what I do, I got the money, dollar, dollar and I gave each
1:07:22
child, there was 20 of them, each child one dollar each to spend this.
1:07:27
I said you,
1:07:30
you save this to show that we were here, that you
1:07:34
were here singing, that’s the significance of this, not to spend this.
1:07:38
So this time
1:07:41
I’m going to have lots of dollars to give to the children, yes something
1:07:44
even more, something to think about.
1:07:49
That’s what I do, well yeah I gave, oh, I have several boxes there.
1:07:56
When I left because what happened, we went to the mountain and to
1:08:00
the mountain areas in our place.
1:08:00
They
1:08:03
invited me, and
1:08:07
then I went to see the [?] here.
1:08:08
I have a friend there, I bought some, those medical gowns, oh they give me
1:08:16
around 50, I might put them because this is good I said because some,
1:08:22
some children in the Philippines.
1:08:24
It’s called gowns or whatever, so they can this gown could be their own blanket.
1:08:34
So I gave these gowns there.
1:08:37
I gave, I have a friend who prepares, who makes these rosaries, its Catholic
1:08:44
rosary, I give to these people,
1:08:50
pens and pencils and then I said oh my barrio - my barrio that’s a, barrio in the
1:08:55
Philippines is a village - I think they might be angry at me I said, because I am
1:09:04
giving things to other people, other barrios, why not my own?
1:09:08
So I, I concentrated there in my own, I have, I have some pictures of those.
1:09:14
So I give these children and I gave those,
1:09:20
you go to
1:09:23
Home Depot, you know those flashlights, those big ones, it’s just $5, $4.99.
1:09:28
I give to the head teacher, I give to the police [laughs].
1:09:29
I give for the schools, I have lots of, I brought, I bought
1:09:31
another one, that’s what I give to
1:09:47
people there.
1:09:47
All the old people, oh my gosh, oh what’s this, oh so many [laughs].
1:09:51
All
1:09:58
the children, oh they love it,
1:10:06
backpack, pens, pencils, notebooks and we give medicine, so, well a little help.
1:10:09
So
1:10:14
is there anything about the Asian Family Center that we haven’t talked
1:10:19
about that you’d like to talk about?
1:10:21
Well I,
1:10:27
I think we have done much, although I think lately we haven’t had any
1:10:37
community activities, sort of a gathering or
1:10:42
some celebration just to inform directly or indirectly to the people that we exist.
1:10:48
You see it’s something, anniversary or
1:10:55
Asian Family Center or something to celebrate.
1:10:57
And then people all over the communities will be there and then
1:11:02
we can give awards like what we did before, but lately we haven’t done.
1:11:06
So in the beginning there use to be more celebrations?
1:11:09
Yeah, yeah we had that before.
1:11:10
We had that
1:11:15
all during our supporters because before we got grants from that shoe
1:11:23
manufacturing, that shoe manufacturing, Adidas was it, was it Adidas.
1:11:24
It was the shoe manufacturing, yeah in Oregon.
1:11:24
Or Nike?
1:11:31
Nike, yeah.
1:11:33
We, we get grants before and then we.
1:11:38
So you, you’d like to.
1:11:38
All of them, just to show our appreciation and
1:11:44
that sort of.
1:11:45
Lately we haven’t had, I think we should have one.
1:11:47
A celebration?
1:11:47
Once a year, the people will know.
1:11:51
So the celebrations that you mentioned you use to have?
1:11:54
Were those the Asian Cultural Nights?
1:11:56
Were those the ones that you remember?
1:11:58
Yeah,
1:12:00
I think we should have one, lately we for the past many years.
1:12:05
That was ten years ago [laughs].
1:12:08
When we had it in, in the hotel there near the airport,
1:12:18
yeah Monarch, no, no, no not Monarch, I think that’s what, so the people will
1:12:27
go and know that we are still around.
1:12:30
Yeah, we have not had any for the past years, especially so with the
1:12:39
I don’t know I was, I was telling because Lee Po will be going out, I
1:12:49
think.
1:12:49
Because I know IRCO, I was thinking why don’t we give him a go out or a sort
1:12:56
of a despedida party and then we can inform well and then I think during
1:13:02
that occasion they will know that he is going out and then we have to
1:13:06
honor him at the same time the public will know who is taking over, isn’t
1:13:18
it?
1:13:18
The change of management, so people, the public will know.
1:13:20
I think that’s what we, what we need now is for
1:13:27
people knowing that we are still around because lately we don’t, I don’t know.
1:13:35
We haven’t had any celebrations or any, any activities, we’re in the community
1:13:43
dis-involved or no one knows about it.
1:13:46
Yeah, yeah that’s my only comment I think, but we are doing ok,
1:13:54
so.
1:13:55
Anything else that you will like to talk about?
1:13:58
Yeah, it’s so nice for me to get involved not only in my community,
1:14:04
but with the Asian community.
1:14:06
Yes.
1:14:07
So.
1:14:08
Do you plan to continue to be involved for many more years?
1:14:12
Yeah as long as I am, I am 90 years old and
1:14:18
I, I have to spend the best part of it or
1:14:27
I am getting old
1:14:31
with poor sight, with poor ear hearing [laughs] - everything.
1:14:37
So I have to make the best out of what’s left in me
1:14:43
[laughs].
1:14:43
So, I guess so many people in our community, oh my gosh, say who is this and
1:14:50
they are still young and I say oh how can you do that, I often say, just imagine the
1:14:58
president, president, generals, actors, seventy, sixty, they are dying, why?
1:15:05
So it’s only in
1:15:12
there that knows when [laughs] it’s not under our control.
1:15:12
If it’s your time, it’s your time because I say you see young people they
1:15:19
are in cane seventy, sixty year old, they are using, so I am lucky somewhat.
1:15:28
You just don’t know when the time comes, your end, so.
1:15:31
So is there anything else about your personal life that you’d like to
1:15:37
share that we haven’t talked about?
1:15:39
Well as much as possible whatever I can afford I will do to help people
1:15:44
especially so in the Philippines or
1:15:49
wherever.
1:15:51
So every time I go home, every time I go out I say my house is full of
1:16:00
something.
1:16:01
Every time I go home I pass by I am, I don’t know why.
1:16:09
Yesterday I, I went around and then I, I bring really, I think of people
1:16:19
in our, in our, in the Philippines.
1:16:24
I don’t know – what’s it mean?
1:16:25
So you’ve always wanted to help people?
1:16:25
They say, “why do you have to, why
1:16:27
do
1:16:33
you buy in the Philippines?” they said. There are things there, but you
1:16:38
know the mentality of people there, I say because I give my uncle a shirt
1:16:46
arrow, arrow shirt oh he, he came back to me, “Oh Simeon this made in Korea”
1:16:58
[laughs].
1:16:59
You keep shoes then?
1:17:01
If it’s the Nike, Adidas, oh they don’t like because I told them you know what
1:17:08
I am wearing in the, in the America?
1:17:12
Only when there is a sale I say [laughs].
1:17:15
I don’t buy
1:17:22
or whatsoever or go to a big store, when there is a sale that’s when I buy things.
1:17:27
And in
1:17:30
here you are also selective, oh my gosh.
1:17:33
So for your legacy, for your life, you’d like people to think
1:17:38
of you as someone who, who was of service who helped the community?
1:17:43
Is that what you’d like?
1:17:44
Yeah I, I don’t know.
1:17:47
I wish I could really, one thing more.
1:17:49
I think
1:17:56
the economy say oh the economy is improving since its good, so you have
1:18:01
to help the economy, you have to buy because they say it’s an indicator that,
1:18:03
economic indicator; oh, the economy
1:18:15
is going down, people are not buying.
1:18:19
So you have to help the economy,
1:18:24
well that’s life I guess.
1:18:29
I don’t know.
1:18:30
Well, I wish, I wish I could help the people.
1:18:35
I think you definitely have, your entire life, you’ve, you’ve been
1:18:39
of service to your community.
1:18:40
I, I wish I, I, I wish I, I win in the sweepstakes so I [laughs].
1:18:46
So you would give all the money to, to help people?
1:18:50
Help more people, I have more money to buy for
1:18:54
the people.
1:18:55
And you know, every time a cardboard freight there is that sale of
1:19:05
the [?] , shelter, I bought so many because in, in my place.
1:19:11
In the place where I work before it’s in the middle of the city and people
1:19:15
just fence, cement fence, they are
1:19:20
there and they are sleeping on carts and
1:19:30
the shelter only is blanket and it rains right
1:19:39
outside, typhoon, typhoon, every, every Friday in Manila right now.
1:19:41
Every week, typhoon, typhoon, rain, rain, rain and people I don’t know so many
1:19:50
poor people, oh my gosh.
1:19:54
Shelter,
1:19:56
food, I don’t know I wish and then here comes the flood.
1:20:05
People get sick; the children get sick, because of the flood.
1:20:15
The water is, so many getting sick, oh my gosh, it is too much pressure
1:20:22
on the government to help, yeah.
1:20:28
So we have to help people.
1:20:34
Well,
1:20:36
that’s life.
1:20:39
Well that’s wonderful that you’re a part of so many organizations that
1:20:44
help people.
1:20:45
Yeah, I don’t know that’s.
1:20:47
So many organizations and
1:20:51
national [laughs].
1:20:51
[Laughs] you just need more time.
1:20:53
[Laughs] Yeah.
1:20:54
[Laughs] Right.
1:20:56
Wonderful.
1:20:57
But I’m getting old, its, its.
1:21:01
I want to get out [laughs].
1:21:05
Well in closing, do you have any closing thoughts or anything you’d like to share
1:21:11
at this time for the end of the interview?
1:21:15
Pardon?
1:21:15
Anything else you’d like to share, before we conclude the interview?
1:21:19
Well I think,
1:21:23
we have to get connected, you know, with people.
1:21:26
So we know how we
1:21:31
stand, if because it’s only the way by which we know what’s going around.
1:21:36
If you seclude yourself, how do you
1:21:43
know what’s going around?
1:21:46
So if you know what’s going around, you get involved or not get involved and
1:21:47
that’s the way, that’s the best situation that, that myself, my personal self.
1:21:56
There is something here, there is something good, if there’s something
1:21:58
to be done, that’s the only way.
1:22:00
Otherwise, you don’t know what’s happening, isn’t?
1:22:04
So I have to be involved.
1:22:07
In my community they said, “Oh you, you are a member of both organizations?”
1:22:13
“Oh yes so I know what’s going on in the community.” If you are
1:22:18
there not getting involved how do you know what’s going on isn’t?
1:22:24
Right.
1:22:24
So if you [?] if you’re not.
1:22:28
I, I am always there.
1:22:28
Funeral, wedding, birthday, I am always there, so what
1:22:37
is there,
1:22:41
that’s how I spend my time.
1:22:43
Connected to the community.
1:22:44
And early in the morning, I but I am not computer wise.
1:22:50
I am good only for email, email I have to know the news; I have
1:23:00
to go to Facebook [laughs] - that’s how I spend my time.
1:23:06
Get around, shopping for things,
1:23:13
