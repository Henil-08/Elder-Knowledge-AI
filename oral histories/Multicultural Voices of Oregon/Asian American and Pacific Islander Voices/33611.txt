00:00
OK.
00:01
My name is Sravya Tadepalli and I’m here with Bella Bose.
00:04
And today is September 12th, 2016, and we are in his office
00:10
at Kelley Engineering at OSU.
00:13
So to start with, can you say your name and when and where you were born?
00:17
You can just say the year.
00:18
OK.
00:20
My name is Bella Bose.
00:22
I was born in India, 1950,
00:27
December 13th.
00:29
OK.
00:33
And can you tell me what your parents’ names are and when and
00:37
where were your parents born?
00:40
My dad—dad’s name is…Bella Gauder.
00:45
J. Bella Gauder.
00:46
And mom—my mom’s name is Keppiammal.
00:52
And they both were born in India, in a small place called...in a district.
00:57
Nilgiri districts and small village.
01:00
My dad was born in Yedekadu, a small village, and my mom
01:05
was born in another village.
01:07
It’s called Ornaldi.
01:09
OK.
01:10
And do you know when they were born?
01:12
I think my dad was born in 1920.
01:16
My mom might have born in 1925.
01:20
They don’t have...any...any...they don’t have the...history, there.
01:25
They don’t keep track of birth certificates.
01:29
OK.
01:31
So can you tell me a little bit about your family, growing up in India?
01:35
OK.
01:38
We have...my dad and mom and my mom had four children,
01:45
myself and three other sisters.
01:47
I’m second in the...second kid.
01:51
And my mom died when she was...when I was...five years old.
01:56
And then my dad married my mom’s cousin.
02:00
And now we have twelve children.
02:03
Six boys and six
02:07
girls.
02:07
And...what else you want?
02:09
Anything you want to tell about?
02:11
Stories about your family or anything?
02:13
They’re a very close-knit family.
02:16
And it was...this is after independence and we...my dad
02:23
and mom never went to school.
02:24
My dad went to school up to eighth grade.
02:27
And my mom...I don’t think she went to school at all.
02:30
Whereas all my siblings...they had college degrees.
02:36
Oh, OK.
02:37
So education is very important in our life.
02:41
And I think after inde—1950s...OK, before...during the...British rule,
02:52
we didn’t have school in my village.
02:54
We have school only up to fifth grade.
02:56
My dad had to walk almost ten miles...five miles each way to go
03:02
from sixth grade to eighth grade.
03:06
The school is about five miles far away.
03:09
I think after independence each and every village had some schools, so
03:17
that’s why we all could go to high school, graduate from high
03:19
school in my village, and then we went to college, different cities.
03:24
So education was very important for my parents.
03:27
So they wanted to make sure all of their children got good education.
03:32
Then that’s how I got my degree.
03:35
I think all my sisters...at least some college degree.
03:41
Many have post-graduate degree also.
03:43
Three of my sisters are teachers, and three of them got degree and then they
03:49
didn’t do any job, they are housewives.
03:52
My brothers...two of my brothers have Master’s degree.
03:56
They are in the United States.
03:59
And my other brother is a lawyer in India.
04:02
Other two are taking care of the family business.
04:05
We have a…growing tea, and they are taking the...taking care of the tea business.
04:12
OK.
04:12
So do you want to tell me a little bit about the family that you
04:12
made here in Oregon that you have?
04:12
Before that, can I tell you about my growing up in India?
04:12
Oh, yeah.
04:12
We can do that first.
04:12
Because...so my school, has about two hundred students, the whole...from
04:15
first grade to...12th grade, or
04:18
11th grade—and
04:21
in a high school graduate class, I have thirteen students,
04:25
three girls and ten boys.
04:29
It’s a very small...small school and I think most of them did
04:38
very well.
04:39
Do you want to finish talking about India then, and then we can maybe transition?
04:44
Do you want to talk a little bit more about what your life in India was like
04:46
or any memories you want to share?
04:50
Yeah, it was very....my village is about
04:56
three hundred houses and I think...two brothers, they were
05:02
settled down about four hundred years ago, so we are all cousins.
05:09
So they are all...the cousins.
05:10
Anything happens, the whole village does it.
05:13
Marriage, wedding, and everything, they do it.
05:17
Especially, it is...some death ceremony, the whole village supports, you know.
05:23
People coming here, there, they provide food for all the people.
05:27
And so...wedding they do on their own, you know, so they invite all
05:33
the village people and they...they provide food and other things.
05:40
And any festival and function, the whole village...and we have
05:45
a temple there near...one or two temples, they do the puja there.
05:50
The whole village does the puja.
05:55
Diwali and other functions, you know, they do it.
05:59
So it’s kind of close-knit family, everybody knows everybody else.
06:02
And...something like that, you know, four-hundred villagers in that area.
06:09
Three-hundred...I think three-hundred fifty...each village is about
06:13
a hundred people or something.
06:15
You cannot marry within the same village.
06:18
So they divide it into four groups, a different four groups, so you can
06:22
marry from one group of villagers to the other group of villagers.
06:26
That’s how it happens.
06:28
And now the girls, when they get married too, they go to the other village and
06:33
then they live with their husbands and the boys stay in the same village.
06:37
OK.
06:42
So do you want to talk a little bit about your education—you talked a
06:45
little bit about your education in India—but do you want to talk about
06:49
for example, high school or after?
06:52
So as I said, high school I have thirteen students in my
06:55
class, ten boys and three girls.
06:57
Then afterwards, I went to pre-university, a one-year
07:01
program, before going to college.
07:04
That’s about...oh, from my village...about seventy miles.
07:10
I went there, studied one year.
07:13
And then I didn’t know what to do, whether to go for physics
07:16
major or go to engineering.
07:20
I didn’t have any clue, no...no way to help me, so one of my friends said
07:25
“oh, go to engineering, you can see—” during that time...there’s a dam coming
07:31
up near my village that a lot of—quite a few engineers there—and he said he
07:36
will look at the engineers, they are all doing good jobs, you know. He
07:39
said it’s nice to go for an engineer.
07:42
So that’s how I decided to go to engineering college.
07:45
So I went to five years of program there.
07:48
I didn’t know which major to take.
07:49
First two years were common, then I liked
07:55
electrical engineering, and that’s why I decided to go to electrical engineering.
07:57
Then I changed to electronics and computer…and computer
08:00
was new at that time.
08:01
Mostly computer engineering, that’s what I did.
08:05
And then during the final year, my friend said, “oh, there’s a good
08:09
institute in India called Institute of Science that’s very prestigious.
08:13
Why don’t you apply?” So then I decided to go do my Master’s Degree.
08:18
So I did two years of Master’s in Institute of Science, that’s
08:21
one of the top schools in India.
08:24
Then during the second year, OK, I was just studying...then one
08:29
of my friends said, “oh, you can apply to U.S.A. You can do PhD
08:36
in the U.S.A.” So I thought it was very nice to know you can go to U.S.A. So
08:43
then I applied. I applied to—a little bit late, so I got admission but I
08:50
didn’t get any financial support.
08:52
That’s why I decided to teach one year, one-and-a-half years
08:57
at BITS Pilani...technology...I taught there one-and-a-half years.
09:01
Then I came to this country in 1977 to do PhD.
09:07
OK.
09:09
So, that’s I guess, why did you move to the United States–
09:11
Yeah, that’s why.
09:12
Yeah, I thought...you know...oh, traveling is nice, to go and
09:16
live in a different country.
09:18
And U.S.A. was one of the top...you know, education-wise and economy-wise
09:24
is one of the top countries.
09:26
So I thought it was nice to come here.
09:30
And moved here.
09:33
And where did you come to the United States when you moved here?
09:35
First I went to Dallas, Texas.
09:36
I did my PhD there at Southern Methodist University.
09:42
So on the way I got my Master’s also.
09:44
I changed to computer science, then I did my Master’s and PhD in computer science.
09:49
OK.
09:53
So, what was it like to move to the United States for you?
09:57
What were some of the either cultural differences you had to
09:59
get used to or differences in maybe school or anything like that?
10:03
Yeah.
10:04
Here...one thing I noticed, as soon as I came here, people are very nice to me.
10:12
And anything, if you go to any office, immediately they do it.
10:16
Everything’s punctual...on time, everything.
10:20
It was not there in India.
10:21
Even when I tried to get my passport, it took me lot of time.
10:26
And here when I come to college, you know, so once you go to SMU, people
10:33
there from secretary to professor to everyone, they were extremely nice.
10:38
But it is little hard in the beginning, struggling here, food and other things,
10:42
you know, so I have to manage myself.
10:44
I didn’t know how to cook, but somehow...you know, getting
10:48
Indian food and eating outside is very expensive at that time.
10:51
I was getting only three hundred dollars.
10:54
So I have to start cooking myself.
10:57
Luckily, those days, there are one or two Indian grocery stores in Dallas.
11:04
So I tried to learn.I cooked and learned from my friends
11:08
how to cook and other things.
11:10
So it was
11:13
nice.
11:15
The challenges are mainly my challenges doing PhD. It was not easy when I came in.
11:20
Up to Master’s, you can just...you
11:24
take courses and get a degree and move on.
11:28
But PhD was very hard for me I thought in the beginning.
11:31
I had to find a new research result.
11:35
It was very stressful period.
11:38
Luckily, I survived.
11:41
I think that was the most difficult.
11:42
When I came here, very stressful doing research, getting
11:48
publications, other things.
11:50
And finding a new topic...research topics.
11:53
My professor was there, a little bit helping, but still
11:56
I have to do all by myself.
11:59
And that was very stressful.
12:04
OK.
12:05
And not being with your family.
12:07
I know...those days I’m not able to call India.
12:11
Also it is very expensive.
12:13
Not able to talk to them, only...we have to write letters.
12:17
Things are different now, you know, after thirty, thirty-five years, now we can
12:20
just call and talk to people in India.
12:23
Every day we can talk.
12:24
It was not like that before, so even if you want to make
12:27
a call, it cost five dollars.
12:30
One per minute.
12:33
Five dollars per minute...then you make three hundred dollars, you know,
12:37
total income...it was very difficult.
12:41
So normally I write letters, it takes fifteen days to go there,
12:44
fifteen days to come here.
12:48
I don’t think I never talked....only once I talked to my parents first three years.
12:57
Yeah, mainly by...there’s no email or nothing at that time.
13:02
That was the most difficult part.
13:05
Living by
13:11
yourself.
13:11
So what sort of things were going on in the U.S. either politically
13:15
or culturally when you moved here?
13:18
When I came in…seventy….so I was so busy with my work.
13:24
I was not following all the political things.
13:28
I think that was the Jimmy Carter period.
13:30
He was the president.
13:32
Now I can see...you know...there were lot of problems.
13:37
Iranian Revolution took place during that time.
13:40
So some of my friends were Iranians.
13:43
They went back immediately during the revolution time.
13:48
And I think interest rate was very high, economy was not doing well
13:57
at that time.
13:58
So that’s the time I still remember.
14:00
More than that one, I was not involved in all these things, but
14:03
I was busy with my own studies.
14:05
I was concentrating on these things.
14:11
So what were some of the things you liked about the United States
14:15
when you moved here and what were some of the things you didn’t like?
14:19
The best thing I liked is people are very honest people.
14:23
They treat people very well.
14:26
And if you do well, you are recognized very well...extremely well.
14:33
People are extremely nice.
14:35
You do your work and you’re treated very well.
14:38
And most of the people here—you know, people are very honest and very nice too.
14:44
That part is the very nice part.
14:47
Not liking U.S.A. is only thing I miss...not able to
14:52
visit India quite often.
14:55
I think that part is the...little difficult part, yes.
15:09
So when you came here, you talked a little about those challenges, did you
15:13
ever face any prejudice from Americans based on the fact that you were
15:16
Indian or that you were an immigrant?
15:18
I don’t think so.
15:19
No.
15:19
I
15:22
never felt any discrimination at all.
15:23
I mean, luckily.
15:25
Maybe...I
15:28
never felt any discrimination at all.
15:33
Is there anything you want to talk about
15:37
regarding the transition?
15:38
You
15:43
know, then slowly I noticed that people were nice and I worked...you
15:48
know, the three years was very challenging but I somehow survived
15:52
and I studied well and got my degree.
15:57
And then...I mean three years, I could finish.
16:00
I wish I could have stayed in the school.
16:02
Now when I think back, I could have stayed one more year, taken
16:05
some more classes and other things.
16:08
I mean anyway, I graduated and I got...OSU is the first job I got and then I
16:14
entered to three other places and OSU gave me job and I think...in hindsight,
16:21
I think that was the best thing I did.
16:23
I took the job here.
16:27
Corvallis...when I first came here, I thought, you know, living in Dallas,
16:31
I thought, it very small place.
16:33
I thought, “oh, maybe I’ll work for one or two years and move to a bigger city.
16:37
But afterwards I felt like...you know, this is a very nice city.
16:42
And also, the place where I come from also, I get lot of rain.
16:47
Green, and it is 6,000 feet—7,000 feet above sea level.
16:51
And very nice climate.
16:54
Climate-wise, it is similar to where I came from.
16:57
So I liked the place.
16:59
OK.
17:03
So what was Corvallis like when you first moved here?
17:06
You know, to be honest...the...HP was there when I came here.
17:12
And...population was 42,000.
17:15
And Winco, and
17:19
all those were not there.
17:21
Mainly Fred Meyer was there.
17:24
It has changed quite a bit.
17:26
I don’t know...I don’t think it has changed so much drastically
17:30
compared to when I first came here.
17:32
There was few more houses, some development and other things.
17:36
Other than that one, I don’t...HP was there, and it has expanded, and it
17:42
has...now it has came down, shrunk...the number of employees has gone down.
17:50
I think other than that one...yeah, new houses, new development came,
17:55
some new industries came here.
17:57
Other than that, not much changed I think.
18:01
OK.
18:04
What was the Indian community like at the time you moved
18:06
here and how has that changed?
18:09
Indian community also, at that time also, we had about...when I first
18:15
came here, about fifty family members or...fifty fac—family members per year.
18:22
Maybe now it has gone up to two hundred I guess.
18:25
Hundred to two hundred.
18:27
It was a nice community.
18:31
It was...I mean, they support each other very well during that time.
18:35
When I first came here, people...they were very nice to me,
18:39
finding an apartment and some invite me to have dinner to their place.
18:40
And how was maybe...OSU or
18:51
the computer science department or either of those changed?
18:55
Oh,
18:57
computer science changed quite a lot.
18:59
So much in the last thirty-five years.
19:02
Whatever I studied, everything is...every year it changes quite drastically.
19:08
So when I first came here, I was assigned to give computer account to students.
19:13
I was in charge of giving twenty-five dollars account to each and every student.
19:17
They can use computer for half an hour, forty-five minute, or one
19:20
hour, and then they have to give to somebody else, next in the queue.
19:25
People there standing for computer, they need to do programming, means
19:28
one hour, afterwards, they have to come and wait in the queue.
19:32
So it has changed.
19:34
There’s no PC, nothing...personal computer was not there, no cell phone, nothing.
19:40
And there’s a big computer.
19:42
Milne Center there’s a computer.
19:43
Everybody has to use that one.
19:47
I think things have changed so much.
19:50
There’s no email, no internet, nothing.
19:53
All these happened in the last twenty, twenty-five years.
19:58
That way, it is...so much drastic changes took place in terms of computer science.
20:04
So when I first came here, computer science was in the College of Science.
20:08
Then it moved to College of Engineering— I came here in 1980.
20:10
Then 1992, it moved to College of Engineering.
20:13
Then
20:17
1992, we are separate—so we are computer science in the College of Engineering.
20:23
And 2003, computer science and electrical engineering, and
20:28
then become the School of EECS.
20:37
Can you tell me a little bit about what you maybe liked
20:43
about Corvallis or what were the challenges of living in Corvallis?
20:48
Corvallis is a very nice place, you know, very simple place.
20:55
Very nice one.
20:56
You know, small community, university town.
20:59
You get almost everything here.
21:02
Only thing is travelling.
21:03
You know, if you want to go, you have to go to Portland and fly
21:07
from Portland or from Eugene.
21:10
Not many flights are available from Eugene.
21:15
So only thing is driving all the way to Portland, flying there, outside.
21:20
The last five, ten years, it becomes very...you know, even if
21:23
you want to go to Portland, it takes almost three, four hours.
21:27
So much traffic congestion in Portland area.
21:31
So that’s the only inconvenient here, living in Corvallis.
21:36
Other than that, it’s a small community, nice place to live here, bring up
21:44
children, very nice community here.
21:48
So with that, can you tell me a little bit about the family that you
21:52
made here in Oregon that you have?
21:54
Yeah.
21:55
I got married in 1981 and we have two children, Sonia and Varun.
22:04
And Sonia and Varun, they moved to...and Rashada also....they
22:10
moved to Bay Area in 1985.
22:13
You know, since then I have been commuting there.
22:15
You know, so...now they are grown, they are doing well and it’s...you
22:23
know...nice in a sense...you know, Bay Area, lot of Indian community
22:31
there, they...Sonia loves to dance and so she has lot of opportunity there.
22:38
So that’s one good...about living there.
22:43
But I miss them.
22:45
I have to travel there quite often.
22:47
Almost every week I was
22:50
travelling.
22:51
And what do they do now?
22:52
Well, my daughter got a degree in business and she was working for a bank.
22:58
And recently she has...she got married last year and...you came to the reception.
23:05
And she has a baby, a four-months old baby.
23:08
And she’s taking time off.
23:11
Varun is working...he wanted to become a schoolteacher.
23:15
He got his B.S. in
23:19
psychology and Spanish, and then he wanted to become a teacher.
23:24
He did his education...Master’s in Education.
23:28
He taught for one year and decided not to teach.
23:31
Now he works for Bleacher Report.
23:34
He likes sports and other things, so he works for Bleacher Report.
23:37
He’s a content programmer.
23:41
He’s in San Francisco and Sonia is in the Bay Area, in the San Jose area.
23:47
Now I visit them quite often.
23:51
Because now I have grandson, I visit them quite often, more than before.
24:01
So how do you think it was for your kids, growing up in the U.S.—because
24:06
they were Indian-American?
24:07
So how do you think it was like for them growing up?
24:11
I
24:14
think they got both culture, you know.
24:14
So they were visiting India also quite often.
24:18
Still, they have good connections with their...all their relatives, and
24:21
they know everybody there, you know.
24:24
We make sure they visit there quite—at least once a year.
24:28
And...I think...here growing up is...they become independent.
24:35
Thinking is like any American here.
24:40
Even though they look...Indians, just like you, they are independent
24:47
thinkers and they decide...most of the decisions they make their own.
24:52
They ask our advice, but you know, finding a partner especially, they do their own.
24:59
In India we all got married through...my parents arranged
25:02
the wedding and other things.
25:04
I don’t think they will do that one.
25:07
Sonia found her own partner.
25:08
They were together...they know each other almost six years, they got married.
25:13
And Varun has...I think he will also do the same thing.
25:18
So that is the big change I could see.
25:22
So
25:28
what major change or impacts do you think you’ve had in terms of either
25:33
your work or on the community?
25:35
Or something you would like to talk about, things that you’re proud of?
25:39
So the main thing is the...proud of...this one is...we become...OK, I
25:46
have been here for thirty-six years...you know, I have been here thirty-six
25:49
years and I, you know...teaching so many students, especially
25:55
Master’s student and PH student.
25:57
I am very proud of guiding about twenty-eight PHD student.
26:02
They are all doing very well.
26:05
And that’s one nice thing about them.
26:06
And I still keep many of my former...formers keep in touch with me.
26:11
They’re very thankful I helped them to, you know...their career.
26:17
When they first came here, they don’t know...want to do research, and most
26:21
of the students have problem finding the...what type of research they need
26:24
to do In the beginning, one or two years, I help them, and then they become
26:29
independent, they do their research.
26:31
So that’s why I’m very proud of it.
26:33
And then I have been associate director for the last twelve years.
26:38
So we have tremendously improved our school, School of EECS.
26:43
Right now—when we looked at top twenty-five–when Dean Ron Adams
26:49
was there, he wanted to become top twenty-five—I think Terri
26:56
and I looked at all the things.
26:57
We improved the number of PHD student.
27:00
And right now, the school has close to 225 phD student.
27:07
The whole university has only 800 PHD students and more than
27:11
twenty, twenty-five percent of the students are in our program.
27:16
So I think that we hired very good faculty members and we did very well.
27:21
I am so very proud of that one.
27:24
And helped all the junior people...when they are...we have good people and helped
27:28
the junior people to improve their career.
27:31
I think...I’m very thankful...you know, I’m very...I mean, very
27:36
humble and I’m very happy about it.
27:42
OK.
27:45
So how do you think that you were changed by living in
27:49
Corvallis or the United States?
27:52
You know, OK, more than that one, I will tell you.
27:54
This faculty position helped me quite a bit.
28:00
When I was in India, I don’t think...even till twenty, twenty-two years, I
28:03
never travelled more than fifty miles away from my hometown or my village.
28:09
So coming to U.S.A. opened up my mind so I could see so many new people
28:16
in the last...you know, I mean, faculty members, I travelled...almost
28:21
fifty, fifty-five countries.
28:23
Each and every place, when I go there, I try to meet the local people.
28:28
What I found was, what I found is, almost everybody is same.
28:34
This is what I tell everybody.
28:37
Almost all human beings are same, and everybody wants to have a
28:41
peaceful, conflict-free life.
28:43
So...and also...they want...each, now, when I look at it here, everybody wants to
28:48
have a good education for their children.
28:50
Whether you are in Asia, Africa, or
28:54
Europe, or you know, Africa, and South, North America, Australia.
28:59
I had a chance to visit those—so many countries.
29:02
Everybody is same.
29:04
They want to have good education for their children.
29:07
Good life for their...themselves and their children.
29:10
That’s what they’re looking.
29:11
I think that opened up my mind.
29:14
I think I’m very thankful for that one.
29:17
This...this job has given me the opportunity.
29:22
OK.
29:23
And what are some of the best memories that you’ve had in Corvallis, living
29:29
in Corvallis that you want to share?
29:31
The best memories?
29:32
Oh, my children.
29:34
I had two children born here and that was most amazing thing happen to me.
29:40
And...I think that’s...I should say, they gave me so much happiness in my life.
29:52
Anything that you want to talk about at OSU also, any special memories at OSU?
30:00
OSU, yeah, I mean, last twelve, thirteen years, you know,
30:00
we have done extremely well.
30:00
I mean we’ve improved our school image.
30:00
Anybody who comes here,
30:12
look at our school, they all said, “oh, it’s one of the
30:16
best schools in the nation”.
30:18
We have a very good, strong program.
30:21
Your dad is the program machine learning.
30:24
That’s one of the top five programs in the nation, top 5 to 6.
30:29
And similarly, EC, we have a strong program in many areas...circuit design.
30:31
I mean we have
30:36
extremely, very talented faculty members.
30:41
Yeah,
30:45
I’m proud of that one too.
30:46
Yes.
30:46
And is there anything else you want to share for the historical archives?
30:53
Anything at all, any memories, anything you just want to talk about?
30:57
I think I had a wonderful time here in Corvallis.
31:01
People are extremely nice.
31:07
I never imagined I will be staying here for such a long time.
31:11
I still enjoy my work.
31:13
I still try to help the student faculty and everybody so
31:19
OSU can improve their image.
31:23
So OSU is the top 10 land-grant university goal.
