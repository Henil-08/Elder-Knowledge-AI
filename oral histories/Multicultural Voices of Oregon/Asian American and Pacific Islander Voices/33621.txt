00:01
OK.
00:01
So my name is Sravya Tadepalli and I’m here with...
00:06
My name is Bhaskar.
00:08
And I’m Sucheta.
00:11
And the date is August 25th, 2016, and we are in their home in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:17
So to start with, where and when were you born?
00:23
I was born in Vellore, India, in Tamil Nadu.
00:32
I was born
00:37
‘49.
00:37
My name is Eldurkar Bhaskar—actually, it is Bhaskar Eldurkar.
00:43
And I was born in Chennai, or it was called Madras at that time, in Tamil Nadu.
00:52
And I was born 1942.
00:58
As of now or previously, what were your occupations or are are your occupations?
01:05
I was a teacher.
01:08
Preschool teacher here and then in India, I was...there also I
01:13
was a teacher in preparatory.
01:15
Preparatory class means it’s...like kindergarten, so...yeah,
01:23
that’s what I used to do.
01:26
So, I’m retired currently.
01:29
And I used to work in Hewlett-Packard as a manager.
01:34
And then an engineer manager...and then before that, I was...in
01:41
India also I was in engineering.
01:44
I was a manager there too, in a solar photovoltaic factory.
01:51
And basically, my background is engineering background.
01:57
And that is what I have pursued in all my career.
02:02
OK.
02:04
And could you tell me what are your parents’ names and when and
02:09
where your parents were born?
02:10
You can just say the year.
02:16
My parents’ names are Keshavrao, my mother, and my mom’s name is Surabai.
02:19
And my father I think was also born in Vellore.
02:25
And my mother...I don’t know
02:31
where she was born.
02:32
Probably, I’m thinking…Madras.
02:34
I don’t know.
02:37
Tamil Nadu.
02:37
Tamil Nadu.
02:38
And...what else?
02:43
Your father was born.
02:44
When was he born?
02:46
He was born in 1910.
02:49
And my mom was born in 1928.
02:51
And
02:55
your father is no more.
02:56
My father is no more and he used to work in Indian bank.
03:01
And my mom was a housewife.
03:05
And she lives in—
03:06
She is in Bangalore right now.
03:09
And you’re father is no more.
03:09
My mom was a housewife.
03:12
So my father’s name is...or was Raman Rao, Lakshman Rao, Raman Rao.
03:19
And he...I’m
03:22
not sure.
03:24
But he was born in 1904 and
03:38
he died pretty young.
03:39
And he was in railways.
03:40
And he died in accident, a railway accident.
03:41
And my mother was...name was...name is Shakuntalabhai, and she was born
03:50
in 1911 and...she lived with us here in Corvallis until she died in 1995.
04:03
And she was a housewife too.
04:06
OK.
04:08
So can you tell me a little bit about your family growing up in India?
04:15
Brothers and sisters, what was your family like?
04:18
What do your siblings do now?
04:20
I have a sister, older sister, and she is...you know, in Bangalore right now.
04:31
She used to live in Thanjavur, and right now, she...my brother-in-law
04:36
passed away, so she is in Bangalore.
04:38
And my brother also lives in Bangalore.
04:43
He used to work for bank.
04:46
Now he’s retired.
04:50
And...what else?
04:53
Your brother is married…
04:53
Yeah, my brother is
04:56
married and he’s got three children.
05:03
Just talk about your family, growing up, how it was.
05:09
We had a really good time when we were growing up.
05:14
And even now when we go and visit, we have a good time.
05:18
Good relationship.
05:20
Good relationship with brother and sister.
05:25
You went to a school…first...
05:26
Went to school
05:50
very close by to our house.
05:51
In the college also.
05:51
There was a number of families around.
05:51
I have a lot of uncles and aunts and cousins.
05:52
We all...we are all very close.
05:52
You have something like forty-six cousins?
05:54
No, thirty-six first cousins.
05:57
First cousins.
06:01
These are all first cousins.
06:02
So you have how many uncles?
06:03
Yeah, I have...my father has got...he had...now all of them are gone.
06:09
He had...there were seven brothers and two sisters.
06:12
So
06:15
we all had...you know.
06:16
Whenever there was any kind of...you know, like weddings or anything,
06:23
anything going on, any occasion, we all get together and we have a very good…
06:29
My wife’s family, as she was saying, she has seven uncles
06:35
and three aunts, all siblings.
06:40
Eight brothers...basically, eight
06:46
boys and three girls is what the...the grandfather had...grandparents had.
06:53
And they all had a very big family.
06:55
They all get together very nicely.
06:57
They’re all very close to each other.
07:00
They all support very nicely each other.
07:03
And any function in anybody’s house, everyone comes around
07:08
and pitches in and does a lot of
07:17
supportive...way.
07:19
In a supportive way.
07:20
And actually, there...also, we are
07:26
very...what should I say...spiritual in nature.
07:35
The brothers, cousins, they’re all very spiritual in nature.
07:39
And support religious activities and religious functions.
07:45
And extremely nice family.
07:52
Maybe I’ll stop there, OK?
07:53
OK.
07:53
Do you want to talk about your family?
07:56
Right, my family.
08:00
My family...as I told you, my father died when he was very young.
08:06
So I was...myself and my mother were supported by my uncle and aunt.
08:17
They really took care of us when I was growing up.
08:21
And I have one older sister...or I had one older sister.
08:27
Big gap between my sister and myself.
08:30
Like...eleven or twelve...or thirteen years gap, I think.
08:36
And she was married off very early in our age.
08:43
When I was just about one year old, she was married off.
08:48
And...but she also supported us
08:55
financially and morally when I was growing up through my school and college years.
09:05
And again, very supportive family we had.
09:09
My grandfather and his brother, my grandfather’s brother’s
09:16
family, they supported us.
09:21
My mother being a widow and I was an only child...boy, that she had to take care of.
09:27
So as I said, my uncle, my father’s younger brother, was
09:33
the one who took care of us.
09:35
And...that kind of a very supportive family is what...you know, made us
09:44
survive through some difficult times.
09:47
And...I went...I went to a very...what should I say...kind
09:58
of a nationalistic school.
10:01
In the sense that this was a...when I was going to school, we just
10:06
had independence at that time.
10:09
Indian independence, we had
10:13
received from English rule.
10:17
And so our high school...many of the teachers and the...the whole
10:25
school system was a freedom fighter kind of a...freedom fighters are
10:34
the ones that...who managed the school.
10:38
So we...our school itself provided a very nationalistic background
10:40
when I grew up in the high school
10:54
time.
10:59
Fortunately I did pretty well in my school and so I was able to go through school
11:06
and college on scholarship and free-ships and things like that, which...did not
11:15
fortunately burden either my mother or my uncle financially that much.
11:23
I went to...I did my engineering in the engineering college in Bangalore.
11:29
And then I went on to do my Masters in India Institute of Science.
11:35
And then I worked in Bombay for sometime...for about almost three years
11:41
before I came to U.S.A in ‘69, for the
11:49
first time.
11:50
And I was here...I went to OSU first time, and I was here just about a
11:52
year and got another Masters, and then went on to Bay Area for a couple
11:59
of years, then went back to India to be of service to Indian system.
12:07
And I was there for about eight years...back in India before
12:11
I came back again in 1980.
12:16
And since 1980, I have been living here in U.S.
12:20
OK.
12:21
So
12:23
I guess I’ll just ask you the next question
12:28
while we’re waiting.
12:29
In India, can you tell a little about what your life was like in India?
12:35
Do you have any memories of India that you want to share?
12:39
Oh, yeah.
12:40
So when we are growing up, we...we have seen a number of situations where
12:50
we had to go through...hard times.
12:58
We used to have what is called a ration system, where the grains
13:05
that you would get would be limited.
13:10
And most of us...we grew up as vegetarians.
13:14
We are basically vegetarians by...by...I won’t say necessity, but definitely by
13:27
social structure, we were vegetarians.
13:30
So we had to really depend upon grains, like rice and wheat and...so
13:38
when we were growing up, it was hard.
13:40
But
13:43
more recently, of course, you know, because of various...agricultural
13:55
improvements, things have improved to such an extent that
13:59
there is no really...possibility of...anything really...any need
14:04
of rice, any things like that.
14:07
So the other thing that we...as Sucheta was mentioning, family
14:16
was very supportive family.
14:19
And so...not only family, but even the friends around...the
14:27
friends and relatives and your neighbors were all very supportive.
14:34
In many ways.
14:35
And not necessarily giving us anything.
14:39
But just being there to help us if necessary, and just being there
14:44
to...you know, we...I don’t think we ever had a need for...to find
14:53
a babysitter or any such thing.
14:56
You could just go and we would be playing outside in the road.
14:59
And there was no fear at any time of anyone coming and
15:04
picking us off and taking us away or...such things were not there.
15:09
Very safe environment that we grew up in.
15:13
And...there was no...the children around, we are lots of
15:23
friends...children and boys and girls of similar age all the time around.
15:31
So no problem finding...finding friends to go and have fun.
15:42
And cricket was a big thing for us.
15:45
And we were playing cricket quite a lot.
15:49
And cricket and...many games, you know.
15:59
I don’t know if there is a...English term for this...there
16:04
is no English term for that.
16:06
There is a
16:12
game called...gulli-danda.
16:14
Gulli-danda?
16:14
So, it was...you...basically, you had a small, little piece of wood that
16:28
you strike with another longer piece of wood to play with that, you know.
16:32
That was a fun game that we all as kids we enjoyed.
16:38
And of course, cricket.
16:39
We would play, we would go to the playground and play cricket with
16:43
a tennis ball or a rubber ball.
16:46
And later on when we went to college, we would play with a real cricket ball.
16:54
And the school itself, you know, as I mentioned earlier, very nationalistic
17:00
school, where we learned to do what is called...be volunteers.
17:03
Volunteerism was something kind of instilled in us, in school.
17:05
That is...in other words, you know,
17:14
we had to go and help with whatever needed to be done in the school for
17:21
various functions, activities, and so on.
17:25
And lots of holidays...many holidays for various religious functions.
17:34
And there, they were also followed in schools and we went and
17:40
helped with those activities too.
17:44
And some of my best friends are from my high school.
17:52
Even now, when I go back to India, I meet with those high school friends
17:57
to...you know, once a month or whenever we go back, we meet with them, go
18:03
out, have lunch or brunch or whatever.
18:09
A bunch of us, maybe ten, fifteen of us, who all grew up together in high school.
18:15
In fact I also go and meet my high school teacher, who is fortunately still alive.
18:22
And he’s probably one of the best high school teachers I have had.
18:28
So...really, a very solid foundation we got.
18:37
Some of the best memories of my high school for me are my high school days.
18:44
And college, again, I also meet with my engineering college
18:49
students at least once a year.
18:53
And also I am in touch with many of my college classmates.
18:59
My engineering college classmates.
19:00
Yeah.
19:01
Maybe I bored enough.
19:02
No, no, no.
19:03
It’s interesting, actually.
19:04
The freedom fighters ran the school.
19:06
So do you want to share
19:10
any memories that you want to share about growing up in India?
19:20
What are the memories?
19:20
Like I said,
19:25
my family, we are a close-knit family, so we always...for every
19:34
occasion we still get together.
19:44
For any kind of occasion, we all get together.
19:48
And basically...that’s what we do.
19:52
What about your friends?
19:56
You had friends right opposite you, right?
19:59
Around the—
20:00
We had, lot of...our neighbors, and we always, after coming back
20:06
from school and all, we always used to...you know, play together
20:17
and...you know...then...
20:19
You still meet with some of your...
20:21
Some of my friends I meet.
20:28
But right now, you know, everybody has moved out, far away and
20:30
it is very difficult to meet.
20:34
Do you want to share anything about what your education was like or
20:39
your school?
20:40
Yeah, I went to a school.
20:44
Like I said, it was very close to our house.
20:47
College also I went right there only.
20:50
And...you know...it was...
20:52
It was an all girl’s school.
20:56
Yeah, it was all girls school.
20:58
But—
20:58
Yeah, it was a girls school.
21:01
And my school was all boys’ school.
21:04
But now it is a coeducational school.
21:06
In her case it’s still a girls school.
21:11
Girls school.
21:11
I think only up to 8th they have—8th
21:15
or 6th, something like that, they have coeducation.
21:20
Oh, now
21:23
they have co-education?
21:23
No, they have—
21:23
They had even earlier?
21:24
Yeah.
21:24
Oh, OK.
21:27
And then from high school it
21:31
is just for girls.
21:34
OK.
21:37
Is there anything else you want to share about living in India,
21:40
or your experiences in India or anything you want to talk about that?
21:45
I’m just transitioning to the next—that’s why.
21:47
Right, right.
21:47
So...the...this society in general, you know, there,
21:56
is somewhat feudalistic.
21:57
You know...if
22:06
your parents said something, you listened to it, you know.
22:12
Almost no questions asked, you listened to it.
22:15
Or if your boss told you something, you just went and did it.
22:20
So that is how we grew up, OK?
22:25
And of course now, to see here, in our children and in our grandchildren
22:34
growing up...and then...we try to reason with them, we try to talk to
22:39
them, about...you know, why we do this, what you do this for and so on.
22:44
And that...I mean, that is a different...different thing that we
22:52
have to kind of get used to, you know.
22:58
Also, you know...the food and things like that...I remember whatever my
23:07
mom gave me or my aunt or uncle gave me, that is what I would have to eat.
23:14
I’m pretty sure that is the same case with Sucheta.
23:17
But that is not the case with...obviously the children here.
23:24
They have to be coaxed into eating what we think is good,
23:29
what we think is good, right?
23:31
So...anyway, so these are some obvious differences that we have to...we have
23:42
to understand and we have to kind of
23:47
internalize and...maybe change, you
23:52
know.
23:53
Though, you know, with our children, we were pretty
23:58
strict.
24:00
They had to eat what we gave.
24:03
So just like what we...but that may not be the
24:10
case with our grandchildren.
24:10
Anyway, that’s a different matter.
24:11
So the life...it’s interesting.
24:22
Obviously when we grew up, we did not have...you know, cars or any such thing.
24:27
We had bicycling...was our main...after at least college,
24:33
bicycling, walking, taking bus.
24:36
That...what is that...local bus.
24:43
Those were the modes of transportation that we used.
24:46
Only after I started working, I got a motorbike, OK?
24:53
Before that, it was any of these public transportation or as
24:58
I said, bicycling or walking.
25:03
So...I don’t think we found it hard, but now when I go back to India,
25:11
to visit, I don’t think I would dare using the bicycle, because
25:21
of the...the so much increase in traffic there.
25:26
I go for walks, but mostly,
25:30
and fortunately, we use a car.
25:31
We use a taxi.
25:34
And...probably that’s another big reason we have found, we think, we see, that
25:42
people are getting less healthy, you know.
25:47
They have cars in their home, they...they also, like here, they just get into
25:52
the car and go off and come back, and wherever they are going, then come back.
25:59
So they don’t do much walking.
26:02
Lot of—majority of people do, but the people...the so-called...the
26:09
“growing middle class” now, is all getting used to all these luxuries.
26:14
Kind of
26:17
luxuries.
26:19
So when we were growing up, the biggest expense for us would be the food.
26:23
Our...from our...I worked in India, too, right...both of us worked in India.
26:34
And we found our biggest budget amount was the food.
26:41
And...so that was the...we had to really...what we had to afford...that’s
26:58
how we could not save much money to buy an apartment or a
27:02
house or whatever in those days.
27:07
And that was probably...also when we were there, this was in...I’m
27:14
talking about early...in the ‘70s.
27:19
The...you could see that the life was very, very competitive.
27:25
Even now it is very competitive.
27:28
But definitely it was very competitive at that time.
27:31
And that was probably one of the reasons why we came to this country, back in
27:39
1980, and...to give a better life, better opportunity for our children.
27:54
That’s probably one of the reasons we wanted to come back.
27:57
OK.
28:00
OK.
28:01
So then to transition to the next part, which is basically...when did
28:06
you move to the United States and what made you come to the United States?
28:11
So the first time when we came here—I came in ‘69—just after our
28:16
wedding, and at that time I came here for studies.
28:20
Higher studies, OK?
28:25
I had a Master’s in India, but I wanted to do...another...maybe
28:29
Master’s or a PhD, I wanted to do.
28:31
So I came here to do a Master’s and I changed my subject.
28:35
So the Master’s I had in India was in
28:41
electrical engineering, and when I came here, I did it in solid state devices.
28:48
And basically that was the reason, to higher studies...and
28:57
to get
29:00
an experience of having come to a foreign land and working
29:06
here and seeing how it is.
29:10
So...but my intention, main intention was to go back to India, which we
29:16
did, three years later, after getting the Master’s, working for some time.
29:22
Went back to India.
29:24
And I did get a good job and I worked for a
29:30
company called CDIL in the same field, in the solid state field for a few years.
29:37
And this was a company run by...it was a private company.
29:45
So this was run by kind of a one-man show.
29:49
So you could see
29:52
how the management was run.
29:54
Since it was a one-man show it was kind of very authoritative and very autocratic.
30:01
So...so I moved to another...a government run company.
30:10
And
30:13
there, we set up the solar
30:20
photovoltaic manufacturing unit, and it was first in R&D and then
30:25
manufacturing unit we set up.
30:28
I worked there for about...almost four years, yeah, four years.
30:35
And
30:38
basically by that time, I...it was kind of oppressive, in
30:43
the sense it was...actually, the management was very good.
30:43
I liked the management, I liked the atmosphere, everything.
30:44
But it so happened that the...as I
30:53
mentioned,
30:56
the living conditions were not great, and the competitiveness was too
31:03
much, and the...I did not see the opportunity for the children that much.
31:14
So that is why we decided to come back here, to U.S. And that is what
31:20
we did in 1980, we came back here.
31:24
And I started...I came back to study, I wanted to do a PhD. I was
31:30
working towards a PhD. After one year, I was fortunate to get a job
31:36
with Hewlett-Packard in Corvallis.
31:40
And I was...so that’s when I joined Hewlett-Packard.
31:44
Then the family came and joined us.
31:53
After joining HP too, I was working towards my
32:00
PhD, but did not get to complete it because of various family
32:06
circumstances and so on.
32:14
What was it like to move to the United States for each of you?
32:17
What were some of the major cultural differences or culture
32:20
shocks that you had to adjust to?
32:29
When I first came here, I couldn’t understand their accent.
32:34
Then slowly, you know,
32:38
I was able to understand and talk to them.
33:07
And cultural shocks…
33:10
So...what did you think about having your children grow up here?
33:10
Children...I think they were OK in schools.
33:10
We always used to tell our children to be careful with...you know, friends.
33:18
And...we don’t know if
33:23
they had some…
33:24
Drugs?
33:29
Drugs or something.
33:30
So we always used to tell them to be careful not to accept any
33:36
kind of drugs or any such thing.
33:40
So...and I think...they were good.
33:47
OK.
33:51
So I mean...obviously it’s a very big cultural change
33:57
for us.
33:59
And as I mentioned earlier, it was a kind of...ours was a feudal...growing
34:07
up in a feudal system where you just listen to your parents or
34:11
bosses or teachers or whatever.
34:14
Here...you have to question everything
34:23
here.
34:23
You have to understand before you did something.
34:28
So that kind of...so that was a big cultural
34:35
adjustment we had to make.
34:37
The other thing was obviously...we could see the children, when they
34:43
were growing up here—I mean they grew up for part of the time there.
34:48
Jayanth when he came here, he was 10 year old and Jyoti was 8
34:53
years old and when they came here,
35:00
they also had a little difficulty first adjusting to the language and all that.
35:05
But they were pretty quick, as youngsters, they were pretty quick.
35:09
And then after that,
35:13
you could see...I mean I...definitely we could see, that they had to
35:18
live two or three different lives.
35:22
One was being an Indian firstly, at home, and being an American in school.
35:32
So you could see they had that multicultural personality that
35:34
they had to develop and be
35:38
that way.
35:39
And also we were vegetarians at home, so they have to, when they
35:46
go out...they have to be...I mean that’s what they were used to.
35:52
All of a sudden they could not go and change to being a non-vegetarian outside.
35:58
So those are the things that...and are kind of...back of our mind it worked.
36:03
But not necessarily they didn’t show it.
36:05
But...to some extent the difficulty that we are putting them through, the children
36:14
through, for having to adjust...when they come home, and adjust differently when
36:23
they go to play with their...be with their
36:33
friends.
36:35
One good thing was they had a number of Indian friends that they had.
36:45
Fortunately this was not too isolated.
36:48
There
36:52
were enough children and adults that were growing up here that
37:00
they had a good set of friends.
37:04
Indian friends and American friends.
37:07
So that helped their growth.
37:10
And also this small town definitely helped a lot.
37:14
Corvallis is absolutely a wonderful place.
37:17
The school system, at least at that time—and
37:25
the other big thing that we found was most of our friends here
37:33
were either college professors or engineers or managers from HP.
37:42
So they had a very good...they had a very good ideal to look up to.
37:54
So that was a good...so if you were in a big city, it is not
37:59
necessary we would have had that.
38:01
Being in a small city and being a small, close-knit
38:07
structure...so it really helped to have all these...this so called “it
38:13
takes a village to grow a child.” I think that really helped, that way.
38:19
Even our neighbors, very nice people.
38:23
They were school teachers,
38:27
or...other people working in
38:31
HP, or you know...basically very good educational background and
38:38
well-brought-up people.
38:39
So...who really helped our kids.
38:43
So I think that was the other
38:47
important thing.
38:49
And
38:52
culturally...at work...again, as an engineer, I had to
39:03
work with mostly engineers.
39:05
So generally, a liberal atmosphere.
39:16
At least no overt
39:20
discrimination.
39:22
No overt...I mean you could here some things, sometimes you would hear something
39:30
which is not...which is not...favorable.
39:36
But
39:38
potentially you could ignore that.
39:42
Otherwise, overall...this being also a school town it happens a lot of
39:48
people had seen foreigners, immigrants.
39:55
So that kind of
39:59
helped.
40:01
I...it’s interesting.
40:10
More recently I had an interesting experience, which is...which
40:18
I would like to relate to.
40:21
That is...what happened...the other day we were walking in the downtown, walking
40:30
along the river.
40:32
So it’s a long time since I...I have been...I have not spoken to
40:38
or conversed...after retirement, I have not conversed with
40:42
many of the local Americans.
40:45
I mean I am an American now, but you know...so my language may not be
40:53
as...or my accent may be more pronounced in terms of being Indian, because I
41:01
speak mostly to other Indians, right.
41:05
Not that many Americans.
41:08
So what happened was we were walking and somebody just said
41:12
“hi”, and then I said something.
41:17
So it was surprising to hear that man turn to me and say, “Are you saying you’re
41:26
hungry?” So...whereas I told him something about something else.
41:33
Some weather or something.
41:35
It was totally different.
41:37
I can’t imagine how “hungry” came.
41:42
So I was thinking a lot about it.
41:45
And I was thinking, maybe he thought I was begging.
41:49
He saw my color, OK?
41:52
And maybe he thought I was begging.
41:58
So I was really surprised at that...that response, you know.
42:07
So why would anyone...afterwards, I was thinking so much, “Do I look hungry?”
42:18
Here I am going with this big tummy and he’s asking!
42:23
So, that was an interesting cultural thing
42:28
in the sense...
42:29
I think he did not understand properly.
42:35
But still..yeah, he did not understand.
42:37
Obviously he did not understand.
42:39
That’s why he said “Are you hungry?”
42:41
“Are you saying you’re hungry?”
42:48
I don’t know. I’m just relating.
42:51
Sometimes these so called prejudices, or so called...what is this?
42:59
You see somebody and you make up your mind, OK, this is what this person is, you
43:10
know.
43:11
On the other hand, I have another very...almost a very negative thing that
43:16
I have to say about myself, you know.
43:20
This is also important, really important, because we Indians think
43:24
we are all above all this race and all that but we are also so racist.
43:31
We were once—this was long back when my mother was here, this was
43:37
probably twenty-five years back.
43:38
We were in Salem one day.
43:40
We were in a shopping mall.
43:44
And
43:46
Sucheta and my mother, they all are gone into the store.
43:49
I was just napping at the steering wheel.
43:54
And then I had my door open, I was just napping.
43:56
And then after some time I got up, about to get out, and I saw
44:05
at a distance a black guy was walking by towards the store.
44:12
Immediately my reaction was to close the door.
44:17
So I feel...even now when I think about it, I feel so bad.
44:22
That—I am a hundred percent sure if it was a white person walking,
44:27
I wouldn’t have done that.
44:30
OK?
44:30
So this is a kind of an in-built...unfortunate
44:36
prejudice.
44:36
So
44:38
I really think...we should...I should get over
44:47
that.
44:47
OK.
44:47
Do you have anything more to say about the cultural differences
44:50
that you’ve experienced?
44:52
Or any likes or dislikes of the U.S.?
44:55
No, I have...my friends and all, my colleagues that I worked
45:00
with...we still get together,
45:05
once in six months, we get together and we have a good time actually.
45:12
It’s very nice.
45:12
One thing to say—her colleagues from the school, very nice.
45:17
Very, very nice.
45:18
They’re very nice people.
45:21
OK.
45:24
So my next question is what sort of things were going on in the U.S. politically
45:29
or culturally that you found significant when you moved here, to the U.S.?
45:36
Either the first time or the second time.
45:41
Politically...so this was in ‘80s.
45:47
Of course that’s when Reagan came into power.
45:53
So it was interesting.
45:55
We were
45:59
going through a depression...not depression, we were going
45:59
through a recession.
46:01
And then we were all...so even though
46:09
basically, we are neither Democrats or...I mean basically
46:15
we are Democrats, all right?
46:17
At least that is what I want to think.
46:22
The...but I think we were kind of rooting for Reagan to come to
46:31
power, or become president at that time
46:36
because he was the one who probably was going to change the economy.
46:41
And which it did.
46:42
It really helped at that time for the country to somewhat
46:48
come back to economic stability.
46:54
‘80 I’m talking about.
46:56
Of course, there
47:00
might be other repercussions now which we are not sure of.
47:05
But anyway,
47:07
that is...I remember distinctly when I first came in ‘80,
47:14
I mean second time
47:20
when I came in ‘80, I also unfortunately...Carter had a really bad
47:26
time at that time, having lost a number of hostages to the Iran crisis and all that.
47:36
Not lost...meaning captured.
47:41
And that fiasco at trying to rescue them, there was a fiasco.
47:46
All of that was not good.
47:51
So...but one thing he did was the system itself seemed to be really good.
48:03
Though definitely more...it is getting deteriorated now.
48:09
It is deteriorating now.
48:15
But definitely the system was
48:21
very impressive, the way the elections went,
48:29
the way the other person was chosen.
48:31
All that was wonderful.
48:33
So...culturally, I don’t...I
48:55
can’t think of anything.
48:56
You know, you could also say, lot of things going up and
49:05
down...kind of early, mid-60s, there was...even though we were not...the
49:14
hippy movement, that was going on.
49:16
And then the war, the Vietnam War.
49:23
I remember in ‘69 when we came, the Vietnam War was still going
49:28
on and that really affected the
49:34
morale for the youngsters quite a bit.
49:37
And then there was all this campus shooting that happened
49:44
in the protest and so some of those things were kind of hard
49:51
to understand, hard to...yeah.
50:00
So what made you—so this is kind of transitioning to Corvallis.
50:06
But what made you want to move specifically to Corvallis?
50:10
Either to study or to move here permanently.
50:12
The second time.
50:18
Because this is the school that I wanted to go to.
50:21
So that’s why.
50:22
That is mainly the reason.
50:25
And it so happened, fortunately, HP was right here, and they offered me a job.
50:31
And then that’s how we decided.
50:34
And of course,
50:38
the city grew on
50:44
us.
50:44
So...what...what was Corvallis like when you first moved here in terms
50:52
of how it may be different from now, maybe how the ethnic makeup was
50:58
different from now or how the town in general was different from now?
51:04
Obviously a much smaller city.
51:06
I remember the first time when we came here, we used to get
51:10
gas for 25 cents a gallon.
51:12
‘69...I mean it
51:15
was gas wartime...otherwise it will...probably 40 cents.
51:20
Sometimes you would go on Highway 20 and you can get 25
51:28
cent gas.
51:29
And
51:35
the first time when we came here, I arrived in Corvallis airport
51:42
from Portland.
51:44
When I came I came through Calcutta to
51:52
Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Tokyo, Tokyo to Hawaii, Honolulu.
51:59
Honolulu to Portland.
52:02
And Portland, in the airport, they had rooms at that time to stay overnight.
52:08
So I stayed overnight in the room, next day, early morning, there was
52:11
a flight from Portland to Corvallis.
52:14
Took that.
52:14
And when I arrived in Corvallis airport, there was a host family waiting there
52:21
with a big sign saying, “Welcome to
52:25
Corvallis”. And that was very nice. And that’s how they took me home, I stayed
52:30
with them for a few days, and then I found a room to stay and all that.
52:31
This
52:37
was in ‘69.
52:39
So in fact we were in touch with them for a long time.
52:43
Afterwards we lost
52:46
contact.
52:48
And in fact Sucheta also flew into Corvallis the first time that she
52:52
came and one of my Japanese friends, actually...when I say Japanese,
52:58
actually he was a Hawaiian-American.
53:03
Japanese-American.
53:05
He had a beautiful mustang.
53:08
He came to the airport to pick up Sucheta and come.
53:13
So this was...again, when she came...first time she came in ‘70, the...the
53:23
first time when I came here, I had to go to the Post Office to send a telegram
53:31
to tell them that I have arrived safely.
53:35
Of course now, we just call, not even do this.
53:47
The second time that we came here, I could make a call.
53:50
But it was also...we had to wait.
53:53
‘80 also, we couldn’t make a direct call.
53:58
We had to ask for a line to be connected to the...their phone to talk to
54:10
them.
54:11
But anyway, this was still...I mean...I remember the first time ‘69,
54:15
maybe the population was 25,000...I don’t remember now...very small.
54:25
The Fred Meyer had opened...what
54:30
is that?
54:31
Was the latest store I think at that time.
54:37
I had pictures of the...what is that?
54:42
All the vegetables and all that.
54:47
I took pictures of that.
54:53
We used to...yeah.
54:56
It is an extremely small town at that time.
54:59
But very nice and very quiet.
55:01
OK.
55:01
So this was a question I was going to ask a little bit earlier.
55:02
You talked a little bit about prejudice.
55:02
Because some people were saying that after 9/11 there was kind
55:06
of...more prejudice against people in the South Asian community.
55:09
Was there,
55:15
in Corvallis?
55:19
Not necessarily after 9/11.
55:24
I mean...some
55:31
indirect comment or the other sometimes you could hear.
55:34
So like I mentioned, this guy asking me, “Are you saying you’re hungry?” I mean
55:40
I have to do lot of circular thinking before I come back and say, “oh, maybe
55:46
he thought I was begging,” right?.
55:49
And why did he think I was begging?
55:51
Because of my color.
55:56
Oh...once, I know, there was...not exactly an
56:02
incident.
56:02
When you were to give the money at
56:06
that soup kitchen or something—
56:09
Yeah, that is also interesting.
56:14
No, once what happened...long back.
56:17
My mom and a very good friend of ours who used to live here, they...we
56:23
all had gone to the Fred Meyer.
56:26
As we were entering, our
56:30
good friend was talking to my mom in Marathi, our language.
56:36
So as she was talking, somebody passed by and said, kind
56:42
of...somewhat nastily, said, “English,
56:47
talk in English.” So why does he bother?
56:53
If we are talking to each other in our language, why does he
56:57
bother about why should I talk in
57:04
English?
57:04
Some crazy people, I think, OK.
57:07
And oh, yeah, other incidents Sucheta was mentioning was—I...oh, this
57:15
happened even in the senior center
57:19
too, once.
57:20
I went to give money...I went to this...
57:27
You wanted to donate some money—
57:29
I wanted to donate some money to the soup kitchen?
57:34
Or the Catholic center…
57:38
Saint Mary’s…
57:40
Saint Mary’s place I wanted to give money.
57:53
So this person told me...so the person thought I had come for soup.
58:05
But anyways, I said “no, I want to give you some…” Again, so it is obvious
58:14
misunderstanding on their part, to think just because they saw a colored person, to
58:20
think that they are in need of something.
58:27
So once in senior center when my mom was there, I was
58:30
looking at their notice board.
58:31
There are lots of notices, so I was just looking at the notice board.
58:34
This
58:42
person said...whatever, the person near there thought I was looking for a job.
58:53
So usually they have little notices about some job or other.
58:58
So I was looking for a...again, a brown person is looking for a job.
59:10
So very indirect kind of
59:15
comments, which would be...I bet you, if a white person was looking at that,
59:26
he wouldn’t have said...the person would not have told him or her,
59:31
“Are you looking for a job?”
59:35
So this happened to another friend of ours, too.
59:41
Young fellow, obviously brown like me, in fact Chona’s son.
59:48
He was working in his yard in his...he was mowing his lawn.
59:50
They have a beautiful home, or they had a
59:56
beautiful home on...Timberhill
1:00:00
area, high up on
1:00:08
the hill.
1:00:08
So he was working there and then this guy, white guy, drives in a car,
1:00:14
he stops and says, “How much do you charge for doing this lawn mowing?”
1:00:21
OK.
1:00:21
He was—
1:00:25
He was mowing his own lawn.
1:00:26
He
1:00:29
was mowing his own lawn.
1:00:29
So these are the kinds of unfortunate incidences or comments.
1:00:38
Again, not overt prejudice, but nonetheless, prejudice.
1:00:47
Do you have anything you wanted to say, or tell?
1:00:50
No.
1:00:51
OK.
1:00:53
If you have anything to add, just talk.
1:00:55
I talk too much.
1:00:57
It’s OK.
1:01:03
There’s a couple of things.
1:01:06
I thought Asha’s arangetram was the first arangetram in Corvallis.
1:01:09
But then, no, your daughter apparently had arangetram in Corvallis.
1:01:14
No, no, no, not in Corvallis.
1:01:15
She did it in India.
1:01:19
Not in Corvallis.
1:01:22
Not in Corvallis.
1:01:22
She also did some fundraising here.
1:01:25
So she gave some performance.
1:01:27
She did perform dance in the Majestic Theater for...for her school.
1:01:38
For her Baker Center.
1:01:41
Twice.
1:01:42
Twice, she did.
1:01:44
And there have been other bharatanatyam
1:01:49
dances in school, in OSU.
1:01:52
Number of them...and Jyoti has participated earlier too.
1:01:58
Where did she learn Bharatanatyam?
1:02:02
Actually in India.
1:02:04
She started and we used to take her to Portland once in two
1:02:11
weeks, for her dance lessons.
1:02:16
And then she got interested and after high school, she took a
1:02:22
year off and she went to India
1:02:27
to learn.
1:02:27
She learned from one year, very intense.
1:02:31
And there, the teacher said, why don’t you do your arangetram here.
1:02:35
And she did.
1:02:40
And
1:02:42
the other thing I was talking to my mom about what should I ask specifically,
1:02:48
and the Thyagaraja Festival came up.
1:02:53
Do you have any insights into how that started, what that kind of was like?
1:03:01
Yeah, actually we started it.
1:03:04
In ‘91, a few of our friends...I don’t know if
1:03:11
you remember Janani, Viji Auntie?
1:03:14
So she and then we did, and then Sharada, Bose’s wife.
1:03:22
You know Bose Uncle, right?
1:03:25
And three or
1:03:28
four of them started this Thyagaraja
1:03:33
Aradhana in ‘91.
1:03:34
So it goes around the Northwest.
1:03:37
‘91 we started and ‘92 it was done in Portland.
1:03:43
In ‘93 it was done in Seattle.
1:03:45
And that’s how it’’s still going.
1:03:50
OK.
1:03:53
That was a very good thing that we started which was...very nice.
1:03:59
It gave all the kids, all those small kids that are learning music...they are
1:04:06
able to go up on the stage and sing.
1:04:12
And even now, some of our friends from Portland, they say that you guys
1:04:19
did such a good job of doing this.
1:04:22
And also the kids will not have this stage fear and things like that.
1:04:28
Where was the first one held, in Corvallis?
1:04:31
At
1:04:34
First United Methodist Church, which is where I used to work, in the day care.
1:04:37
You know, that’s how it started.
1:04:37
I went and spoke to the church, and they gave that hall.
1:04:38
We rented that hall for the day and
1:04:45
we did that.
1:04:50
At
1:04:57
that time, we had...the first time we had probably total of maybe 60, 70 people.
1:05:03
Thygaraja Aradhana.
1:05:07
And then slowly, it became...lot of...lot more people.
1:05:19
OK.
1:05:22
So my next question is, how has the country as a whole changed from
1:05:28
how it was then to how it is now?
1:05:36
So lot of things which we found unsavory when we were here first
1:05:43
has become very commonplace now.
1:05:51
The language used,
1:05:55
the abusive terms.
1:05:57
They are all becoming so common, even small children use that.
1:06:03
That’s probably one of the biggest changes,
1:06:07
I think.
1:06:07
And...in general,
1:06:30
what
1:06:35
I find kind of really disturbing is...the use of F-word
1:06:48
is...taken as a joke, rather than as an abusive term.
1:06:54
If
1:07:00
you see some comedy shows, people laugh only
1:07:08
when the F-word is used.
1:07:10
And that is I think a deterioration in the moral
1:07:17
structure of the society.
1:07:24
And
1:07:27
so...you know, obviously...people’s nature is same everywhere around the world.
1:07:38
It’s a matter of degrees.
1:07:40
I mean here, also people cheat.
1:07:44
India also people cheat.
1:07:45
Every country, people cheat, OK.
1:07:48
But it was always a kind of degree.
1:07:52
And I thought that degree has...slowly going up here.
1:07:58
It was not this bad.
1:08:02
There was some amount of...people were...work ethic was there.
1:08:09
Really, if somebody...if they went to work at eight o’clock in the morning,
1:08:17
they would really get into their work.
1:08:20
But now it’s not anymore like that.
1:08:27
So some of these things...I think it’s slow decay.
1:08:35
So that...I don’t know who is contributing to that.
1:08:38
I think all of us are in some way contributing to it.
1:08:38
Unfortunately, the divisiveness also has increased quite a bit...all
1:08:38
those things...getting worse.
1:08:38
OK.
1:08:38
I mean, that’s what I feel.
1:08:38
I mean, this
1:09:09
is still a fantastic place to live and there’s no doubt about it.
1:09:16
This is definitely...I mean especially Corvallis.
1:09:24
Really amazing.
1:09:26
The quality of life is...there is no comparison to any other part
1:09:35
of the world, I think.
1:09:35
OK.
1:09:35
I mean, we were recently in Europe.
1:09:40
One of the...in Europe we went on this river cruise, and then we
1:09:46
went through a lot of beautiful towns, and beautiful countryside in
1:09:51
Germany and Austria and all that.
1:09:56
Absolutely beautiful.
1:09:57
So you would think, why would anyone want to leave that place and come here?
1:10:02
And really, the way they keep their homes, their
1:10:07
roads, their townships.
1:10:09
So clean, so nice.
1:10:11
All that is amazing.
1:10:15
So why would anyone want to leave that and come here?
1:10:20
And also, they may not have high-paying jobs, but they have
1:10:25
all the things taken care of.
1:10:27
Their
1:10:30
health care is taken care of,
1:10:34
they seem to have decent places, they have good stuff, good food.
1:10:40
Everything is there, you know.
1:10:42
Still, you see people leaving those countries to come to U.S.
1:10:47
So really, we have to think about why they would want to do that.
1:10:54
At least one thought that occurred to me...was again it is...and if you listen
1:10:59
to all their history, their culture and all that, it is...I think they’re trying
1:11:06
to escape there, again, the feudal system.
1:11:11
You know, at one time,
1:11:17
the people higher above were oppressor.
1:11:22
It may not
1:11:33
be so now, still, they’ve got...maybe.
1:11:33
The next question is what change or impact do you think you’ve had
1:11:38
in terms of work or Corvallis?
1:11:40
Did you do anything that you are particularly proud of?
1:11:51
You [Sucheta] have brought up
1:11:59
good children.
1:11:59
Not only our children, but children in school.
1:12:01
All you kids.
1:12:02
And the thing is, some of the parents remember you still and come and thank you.
1:12:12
That’s...I think a great thing.
1:12:16
And for me,
1:12:19
being part of the community, the Indian community, has been very good.
1:12:24
Wherever
1:12:27
we could provide some support, some help, it has been good.
1:12:32
And workwise,
1:12:35
it’s amazing, you know...this
1:12:39
inkjet printer business that I joined, the
1:12:44
inkjet business that I joined...really, it was nothing.
1:12:51
There was no...but today, it is multibillion dollar industry.
1:12:58
Multi-multi billion dollar industry.
1:13:00
So I played some part in that, in the initial part.
1:13:06
So that’s what I feel good about.
1:13:10
It has employed so many people, it has made money for so many people.
1:13:18
Of course, I have to be careful—it probably is also
1:13:27
environmentally…hurt
1:13:30
a lot of environment!
1:13:31
Yeah, my mom told me about the inkjet printers, so I
1:13:34
was going to ask about that.
1:13:40
How do you think that you were changed by Corvallis or the United States?
1:13:47
How did it change you?
1:13:48
What would your life have been like if you hadn’t come to the U.S.?
1:13:52
Oh, this is a very interesting question because one of the things...really, I
1:13:59
know more about my culture and more about my religion after coming here than if
1:14:08
I were in India.
1:14:10
I would be...so we almost take it for granted, when we are in India.
1:14:14
We do a lot of things
1:14:19
as a matter of custom, as a matter of tradition, we do.
1:14:24
Just follow blindly.
1:14:24
Lot of it is
1:14:28
kind of blindly too.
1:14:31
But here, we have really learnt to ask questions.
1:14:38
To...to...understand.
1:14:42
Not that we understand completely, but at least try to understand,
1:14:48
about our own culture and about our own religion.
1:14:52
Especially our religion.
1:14:53
It
1:14:56
so happens that we have a very good guru in Eugene, who has really helped us a lot.
1:15:03
And also we try to read and learn about...again, there’s
1:15:10
a lot more to be done.
1:15:11
So
1:15:15
that is...for being in
1:15:22
United States...probably Corvallis has made us more
1:15:25
environmentally aware, I think.
1:15:31
OK.
1:15:31
So...in connection to that, so I think there’s a shrine in Eugene.
1:15:38
Is it there already in Eugene?
1:15:40
It is there.
1:15:44
I might be wrong about this, but did that start by people in
1:15:46
Eugene or people in Corvallis?
1:15:48
Both.
1:15:53
I heard...did you fundraise for it or something?
1:15:55
Yeah, we’re going to have a dance on the 10th
1:16:04
of September, in Linus
1:16:08
Pauling Middle School, 4-6.
1:16:22
Please come!
1:16:22
It’s free.
1:16:22
It’s free.
1:16:22
So it’s a bharathanatyam dance, by a girl by the name Aishwarya.
1:16:29
She lives in Vancouver and she has learned to dance for quite some time now.
1:16:37
And she is also
1:16:41
a...
1:16:47
She is a disciple of…
1:16:49
She is a disciple of...our guru’s guru.
1:16:53
Young girl, maybe mid-twenties?
1:16:57
She’s performing
1:17:01
as a gift for us and hopefully we will raise some more money from that.
1:17:07
So two years back, we had a dance, odissi dance by a
1:17:15
young lady...she is a white American.
1:17:21
She learned odissi dance going to India from famous gurus,
1:17:27
and she performed same place.
1:17:29
Beautiful, beautiful odissi dance.
1:17:32
And
1:17:35
we raised almost $10,000 there.
1:17:38
So this
1:17:42
shrine, this shrine in
1:17:46
Eugene, is
1:17:57
Mukambika Devi.
1:18:00
Mukambika...the original Mukambika Devi temple is in Karnatakam.
1:18:04
Near Sringari.
1:18:05
That is where...Sringari is where...Shankaracharya.
1:18:15
He was...he’s the guru who was alive in 500 or 600 A.D., I think about that time.
1:18:21
And he’s the guru who...at a very
1:18:44
young age, something like eight or ten years old, he left his
1:18:48
home to pursue knowledge, and he’s the one who...he’s the one
1:19:05
who...read all the scriptures and understood the scriptures.
1:19:13
And
1:19:18
made it
1:19:21
available
1:19:23
to common people by way of
1:19:34
describing what we call adhwaita philosophy.
1:19:37
Adhwaitha philosophy means God is you.
1:19:40
You are God.
1:19:45
There is no one separate.
1:19:46
God is same as you.
1:19:50
I’m pretty sure your mom and
1:19:54
dad follow that.
1:19:56
So that philosophy...he’s the one
1:20:03
who made it more available.
1:20:07
This has been there for millennia.
1:20:13
But...he made it easy for people to understand.
1:20:18
Still difficult to understand.
1:20:21
Anyway, he installed this Mukambika Devi.
1:20:28
Mukambika Devi is supposed to be a combination of all the three goddesses,
1:20:34
Parvati, Lakshmi, and Saraswati.
1:20:40
Near Sringari in a place called Kollur.
1:20:43
So that devi is a
1:20:47
very well-known devi, where lot of people from Kerala and Karnataka and
1:20:55
other parts of the country also go.
1:20:59
Anyway, so that’s the preamble.
1:21:02
Our swamaniji, who is in Eugene,
1:21:08
she got hold of this...somebody gave this idol to her and they had it
1:21:19
installed in their ashram for some time.
1:21:24
And this ashram was owned by a white English lady, young
1:21:35
person, and it was in her house.
1:21:39
But she had to...she was going to go to Coimbatore, India,
1:21:46
for a three-year...three-years schooling under Saraswati.
1:22:00
When she was...there was not going to be anyone there to take care of the Devi.
1:22:06
So we all kind of got together and moved her to
1:22:15
a yurt, behind...one of...somebody’s house.
1:22:21
So currently, she’s...Mukambika Devi is in a yurt, in the backyard
1:22:29
of another American white couple.
1:22:34
And that’s why we go there every day...not we, from the community
1:22:41
to perform puja and all that.
1:22:46
And that yurt, I mean, that devi, she has to find a more permanent place.
1:22:52
So that is the shrine that
1:22:56
we are planning to build or buy, or whatever.
1:23:02
The fundraiser is for that.
1:23:04
OK.
1:23:10
So...two more questions.
1:23:15
So this question, what kind of traditions from India, well you talked about that,
1:23:20
but other traditions, do you want to talk about, that you keep in the United States?
1:23:26
Like doing Navaratri.
1:23:31
And also most of the festivals, most of what’s there, we do it, we do the…
1:23:39
So the important ones.
1:23:41
We do the Ugadi.
1:23:45
Ugadi, which is our New Year, which comes in March, end of April, some time.
1:23:52
And also, Ganesh Chathurdhi, the Ganesh festival.
1:23:58
And Navaratri, and Diwali.
1:24:01
All these things, so that our kids also learn that way.
1:24:09
At least these four, we try to do every year.
1:24:13
Not try to, we do every year, in whatever fashion we can do.
1:24:15
And
1:24:20
then we also try
1:24:26
to remember our parents, my parents, both of whom are not
1:24:32
there anymore, on their death
1:24:39
anniversary,
1:24:41
by doing something or
1:24:44
the other.
1:24:45
For example, I told...we went to give money to the Soup Kitchen, and that
1:24:51
was for that, so we tried to give some
1:24:56
money there, for feeding people.
1:24:59
So some sort of tradition we try to keep, some of those things.
1:25:05
Yeah, the other thing is we don’t eat meat, we don’t cook or
1:25:17
eat...or...you know, non-vegetarian.
1:25:18
So the last question is, what are some of the best memories you’ve had in Corvallis?
1:25:25
Anything you want to share that is particularly memorable?
1:25:32
Our kids were brought up here.
1:25:36
And well,
1:25:40
they went to a good school and college, and they are
1:26:09
doing very well.
1:26:09
In Corvallis?
1:26:09
Corvallis.
1:26:09
Grandchildren, you know.
1:26:09
Our last grandchild was born here.
1:26:13
Wonderful day.
1:26:15
Weddings, the marriages of
1:26:24
our kids.
1:26:24
You know...professionally, some things like...some achievements
1:26:32
at work.
1:26:34
Those are fond memories.
1:26:39
And all of a sudden twenty-five years, thirty-five years,
1:26:43
thirty-six years, we’re living here.
1:26:47
And...and we bought—we built this house.
1:26:59
When we moved into this house, it was a great...great...I don’t know,
1:27:07
I wouldn’t call it an achievement, but it was a great feeling.
1:27:10
And
1:27:14
the day my mother died,
1:27:17
hard one to take, but I remember that.
1:27:23
Yeah, lot of good things.
1:27:29
Some sad.
1:27:31
Always good
1:27:34
things you should remember.
1:27:37
And is there anything else that you want to share, anything that you
1:27:41
want to talk about it so you can have it in the oral history that
1:27:46
you want the future to know about?
1:27:59
Just being here has been fantastic.
1:28:02
Being in Corvallis.
1:28:05
The family and the friends...all the friends, you know.
1:28:14
Many of the friends, Indian friends,
1:28:20
they are our family here.
1:28:23
They come to our support and we try to be of support to them.
1:28:29
Those are the big things.
1:28:31
And
1:28:34
the neighborhoods that you live in.
1:28:38
Nice, quiet, good neighborhoods.
1:28:43
And...when we are not here, people look after our home.
1:28:50
Whether we tell them or not, they look after our home, very nice.
1:28:59
And as Sucheta mentioned, schools were very good system we had here.
1:29:04
The school system, you know.
1:29:07
I think our children got good education.
1:29:12
Very good education.
1:29:12
They are built on a very good foundation.
1:29:19
So
1:29:21
I can’t
1:29:26
be more...you know, effusive about that.
1:29:28
It’s fantastic.
