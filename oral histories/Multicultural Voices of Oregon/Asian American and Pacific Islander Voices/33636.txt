00:00
My name is Sravya Tadepalli and I’m here with--
00:07
Ram Ramanujam.
00:09
Kalyani Ramanujam.
00:11
And it’s August 7th, 2016.
00:15
And we’re at their home in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:18
So,
00:21
to start off with, where and when were you born?
00:26
I was born in a place called Tiruchirapalli, in southern India.
00:35
It is in...in a state called Madras.
00:39
It used to be called Madras State.
00:42
Now it is called Tamil Nadu.
00:45
It’s one of the four southern states in India.
00:50
So I was born in the village,
00:54
small village, called Kariyamanickam.
00:56
The village name is Kariyamanickam.
00:58
It’s Tiruchirapalli district.
01:01
The same south India, where he was born.
01:06
The place where I was born is like...fifteen miles
01:12
from my place to his place.
01:14
Within the same Trichi town.
01:16
Within the same Trichi town.
01:17
It’s a village near the Trichi town.
01:22
And when were you born?
01:24
OK, I was born October of 1950.
01:28
The day before
01:36
Halloween [laughter].
01:36
I was born on May 25, 1958.
01:44
Do you know when and where your parents were born?
01:47
Um...I...no...yeah.
01:51
My parents, I know where they were born.
01:54
In fact, my mom was born in a village, same, in Trichy/Tiruchirapalli...within
02:03
maybe two miles from the village that she [Kalyani] was born.
02:07
My dad also must have born in the same village.
02:17
Yeah, my dad’s year of birth is
02:22
1924, April.
02:24
And my mom was born in
02:29
1929, February.
02:30
My dad, I believe he was born in Tiruchirapalli City, Trichi City.
02:37
He was born in 1926, April.
02:42
My mom was born in the village where his [Ram’s] mom was born, the same village.
02:49
She was born in 1933 August.
02:53
‘33
03:00
August, right.
03:00
Yes.
03:00
As of now, what are your current occupations?
03:03
I am retired.
03:04
And I’m enjoying my retirement!
03:08
I used to work as a design engineer for Hewlett Packard.
03:12
OK, I work at HP, Hewlett-Packard.
03:17
I work for the company called Linebridge.
03:20
That’s outsourcing company for Linebridge, so I’ve been there for
03:26
eight years, working for Linebridge at the HP, Corvallis site campus.
03:34
I am a quality control...I work there in the quality control.
03:40
Where R&D division, where they do the printer testing, pen testing, ink testing.
03:48
My job is the quality control job, over there at the R&D
03:54
testing area, in Corvallis.
03:59
So kind of going back to India, what were your towns in India
04:04
like or your lives in India like?
04:06
Do you have any special memories of what India was like?
04:10
Just talk about that experience, growing
04:18
up.
04:19
Tiruchirapalli town itself, population-wise is...it’s a
04:23
lot bigger than Corvallis.
04:27
But it is situated on the banks of the Kaveri River and it’s pretty nice town.
04:39
It’s...but it’s not very cosmopolitan, ok?
04:44
It’s relatively...I mean, compared to Indian standards,
04:51
it’s relatively a small town.
04:53
And my village where my grandma used to live is very close.
04:57
It’s within fifteen miles, ok.
05:00
And...I also went to college over there in the same town, even though I never
05:06
stayed at home during the college days.
05:08
I stayed in the...they used to call hostels in India.
05:13
So I used to stay there.
05:17
There are a lot of Hindu temples in Trichi town and we used to go to within
05:23
the temples when I was growing up.
05:29
It’s...yeah, it’s a pretty nice place to live.
05:37
The village where I was born is a small village.
05:41
Even today, it’s still the same.
05:43
It’s a small village.
05:45
I think there are probably about fifty homes, facing each other in one...
05:53
It’s called Agraharam.
05:55
It’s...only the Brahmin people live there.
05:58
It was...my childhood...you know, growing up in the village, it was
06:03
really fun, and... I have...we are six of us, six children per my parents.
06:10
I’m the second one, with my sisters and I have one brother and four sisters.
06:16
So we all grew up, such a...you know, the loving family.
06:22
And also my dad,
06:25
he was into agriculture so we had--we used to have a lot of cows
06:31
and you know, it used to be fun.
06:34
It was fun growing up in the small village.
06:38
Such a nice, small town.
06:41
And we have a temple in the same street where we used to go.
06:47
And then there was a river.
06:48
We used to go take a bath in the river.
06:51
Even today, the river still runs the same place.
06:56
It’s very close to the Kaveri River.
07:00
It was fun, such a...you know, fun childhood.
07:06
There’s so many good memories.
07:07
So many to, you know, list.
07:10
But overall, the years, you know, until I got married, you know, it was fun
07:17
growing up over there in the village.
07:21
Do you want to share, like, maybe a couple memories?
07:26
Well, I remember when...not I remember...we...I...in the
07:35
village there is no high school.
07:37
So we have to go in, come two, three miles away from the village.
07:44
So my dad...we used to have a cart, a bullock cart.
07:50
So we used to go in that cart to go to school.
07:53
And then we have the guy, who--you know, he would take care of us.
07:57
He would take us...take us to school and bring us back to school.
08:02
And then we also had a small...it’s again...it’s two-three miles away where
08:09
my dad had...it’s like a small...not small--it’s a huge area with a lot
08:16
of coconut trees and mango trees.
08:19
It’s such a beautiful place.
08:21
We used to go...all our sisters and with my parents, we used
08:25
to go have a picnic over there.
08:29
It used to be so much fun.
08:31
And then, the river...so we used to...there is a...what is it called?
08:37
Yeah.
08:38
There is a day in a month.
08:41
There’s a day in the month, once a year.
08:44
It’s a celebration we do there in South India.
08:47
I think--
08:48
You take food there.
08:49
Do a picnic.
08:50
Food over there, do a picnic.
08:51
The whole village people will do picnic.
08:53
The whole village people will do picnic.
08:54
Do the picnic, take food in the evening.
08:57
Just...you know.
08:58
We also do the dandiyas [stick dance].
08:59
All the girls, young girls will play dandiyas all the way from
09:06
the river to our street back.
09:09
So, so much of good memories.
09:13
Do you want to share any memories?
09:26
Memories...it’s...we...I had a
09:36
very, very close friend when I was growing up...we’re like...like
09:42
twins, and he’s still one of my best friends from my school days.
09:51
And we used to study together always and I used to go to his place.
09:57
And we will study together.
09:59
We will do math together, ok?
10:02
And there were so many other kids in the same neighborhood, ok, but
10:11
we two stood out from the rest.
10:14
We were more focused on our education rather than other kids.
10:21
They were not that serious about studies and we two were different, ok?
10:25
We belonged to two different groups of the Hindu community.
10:31
But still, I mean, we were very close.
10:36
When I look back, those are my best days, growing up.
10:43
And knowing him and being his friend.
10:46
And he helped...I definitely got a benefit out of being friends with
10:53
him and I feel he feels the same way.
10:57
And what about your summer vacation with your grandpa’s house?
10:59
Yeah, summer vacation I used to go to my grandparents’ home in the
11:07
village which is very close to her [Kalyani’s] village and used to have
11:11
fun with my cousins who are of my age.
11:18
Other than that, I don’t know, I don’t recall.
11:21
Are you still in contact with that friend?
11:24
Yes.
11:25
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
11:25
Oh, yeah, I’m still in contact with him.
11:27
Whenever I go to India, I still see him.
11:29
He is one my best friends.
11:30
And...anyway, he was very interested in chemistry and I was interested in physics.
11:38
And so at some point we diverged.
11:42
I mean, he went into majoring in chemistry and I went to engineering school.
11:48
I am still interested in physics, so that’s why I went and did electronics and
11:52
communication which is more physics-based than other branches of engineering.
12:00
Yeah, I’m still in touch with him.
12:03
In fact, I went to attend his son’s wedding one time.
12:07
Yeah, we are good
12:13
friends.
12:14
Going off of that, what was your education in India like?
12:17
Either elementary school or going into college?
12:20
I did my undergraduate degree in India.
12:24
I finished...I did engineering...bachelors in engineering in India and I did
12:31
electronics and communication major.
12:34
And it’s a pretty good school in fact.
12:36
And then I worked in India for a few years before I came to the
12:45
U.S.
12:46
OK, so, I didn’t go to college.
12:49
Living in the small village, it was not possible for me to go,
12:55
because...and also at the same time, my grandmother, my dad’s mom...she was
13:02
kind of, you know, “No school, college for girls!” You know, those days.
13:06
“The girls are supposed to be in the home, get married!
13:10
And have children, take care of the husband and family.” So anyway, my
13:17
grandmother and then my dad, they both were on the same...so I only...I didn’t
13:22
even finish my high school, you know.
13:24
And then before that, I...you know, stopped going to school.
13:31
And then, a few years later I got married, and then...yeah.
13:37
My life--
13:37
She was seventeen when she got married.
13:38
I was seventeen when I got married.
13:42
And then...we...so, yeah, I didn’t...I didn’t go to college.
13:48
When did you stop going to school?
13:51
Long
13:53
time back.
13:54
Long time back.
13:54
Long time back.
13:54
So...just before your wedding, right?
13:57
Yeah.
13:58
Just maybe a year before my wedding.
14:00
And then I didn’t go to school.
14:01
Then I
14:06
got married.
14:08
Then we moved to a different place.
14:11
That was the first step for me to move out of the village.
14:16
I never...I never gone anywhere until then.
14:21
You know, I mean, going to my cousins’ house, who were
14:24
living in Trichi, in the city.
14:27
Every time, you know, every six months we used to go and spend
14:31
some time with our cousins.
14:35
Other than that, I never went anywhere far until I
14:43
got married.
14:44
After I got married, we moved to Hyderabad.
14:46
That’s where he was working.
14:49
And then...that was a big thing, moving out of the small village.
14:57
That’s the first step for me to know the outside world, you know.
15:02
Until then, I was just in my own world, you know.
15:07
So that was a big change for me.
15:11
That was a big change for me.
15:13
So you talked about getting married.
15:15
How did you meet before you got married?
15:17
OK, so this is--our marriage was arranged marriage, of course, you know.
15:24
So my dad,
15:28
you know, found his family and they came to know about him and then
15:32
he was...he finished his studies and he was working in Hyderabad.
15:37
So my dad came to know through somebody else, so ,“Oh, their family,
15:41
they have a son, let’s go get the horoscope.” You know we match the
15:47
horoscope in India, arranged marriages.
15:50
My dad went and got the horoscope from his parents and they...you
15:57
know, they matched the horoscope.
15:58
They had to go to some astrologer who can...you know, read the
16:04
horoscopes to make sure both horoscopes are... you know, matched.
16:10
They have to go through so many matches, you know, to consider,
16:15
ok, these two horoscopes are matched, they can get married.
16:20
So ours...you know, matched, according to whatever is supposed to get matched.
16:28
And then my parents went and told his parents that “We took the
16:35
horoscopes to the astrologers and everything seems to be good so now
16:46
it’s up to you guys to accept.” Whatever they want. So we...then his parents,
16:53
they said “OK”, you know, they also took...because each family has their own
16:59
astrologer, so they took my horoscope and his to their family astrologer,
17:07
to make sure he says the same thing.
17:10
So he also said, everything looks good, it’s a good match.
17:15
So then, they both sat as a family, they talked more, and finally, they
17:22
all agreed, OK, we’ll do the wedding.
17:25
That’s how our wedding happened.
17:27
We never saw each other.
17:28
We never saw each other.
17:29
We never saw each other before the wedding.
17:30
We never even saw our pictures or anything.
17:34
He trusted his parents.
17:39
I trusted my parents.
17:42
Because we both knew that they will do a good job of picking
17:44
the right person for us.
17:48
So that’s how.
17:49
It’s basically...our marriage happened based on trust, knowing that our
17:55
parents would do a good job of finding a right person.
17:59
It’s working great.
18:01
You know, we celebrated our 41st anniversary in this
18:06
May, so yeah, it worked good.
18:09
I think they did a good job of... So I saw him on the day of the wedding.
18:15
So he was...our wedding happened in my village.
18:22
Our wedding was 4 days, 5 days?
18:23
Something like that.
18:23
4 or 5 days wedding.
18:24
4 or 5 days.
18:26
Those days you do the elaborate weddings.
18:30
In the some...three, four, five days, every day they will have
18:35
some ceremony will be going on.
18:37
And so our wedding was 5 days.
18:42
I saw him on the day of the wedding, which was, what?
18:44
Second day?
18:44
Yeah, something like
18:47
that.
18:47
Yeah, second day of the wedding.
18:49
So I saw him.
18:55
I didn’t see her before the wedding.
18:57
And my sister was telling me, “Hey, maybe we can send you
19:01
photo or something.” And I said,
19:05
“no need.”
19:05
Yeah, he was the only one who didn’t see me.
19:09
From his family, his parents, his sisters, they all came to see me.
19:14
And they all came to
19:26
talk to my parents.
19:26
They were OK with me...but he didn’t see me until...So the same way with me,
19:26
I saw everybody in his family except him until the day of the wedding.
19:37
Just missed each other.
19:38
I
19:40
know.
19:42
It’s kind of...I mean even for the Indian standards, even in those days,
19:48
the guy will go and see the girl and talk to her a bit and all that.
19:51
I didn’t do anything.
19:54
I mean, it’s an arranged marriage and if I’m not going to have a whole lot of
20:00
things to say...it should be just fine.
20:05
That’s the...
20:08
I think later on, later years, I think it slowly started happening.
20:13
The boy and girl start talking to each other.
20:15
Now--
20:16
You know, going out for a movie or something.
20:20
They started doing after maybe like...another…
20:23
Few years later.
20:24
Few years later.
20:25
Not when we were.
20:27
Yeah.
20:31
How was it adjusting getting married and
20:40
living in Hyderabad?
20:40
It wasn’t...it wasn’t all that difficult.
20:50
My mom and her grandmother came with us to set up the family unit basically, ok,
20:59
and they lived with us for a month or two.
21:02
And you know, it’s different in India, OK.
21:08
Your...as husband, your primary responsibility is
21:13
to take care of your wife.
21:15
That’s how it is set up, right?
21:19
And it’s love and all that...I think it comes later.
21:25
It’s primarily taking care of the other person.
21:31
She didn’t work and I was going to work.
21:35
We were young and she was eighteen and I was twenty-four.
21:43
She has to get adjusted to new place and I have been living there for a while.
21:47
And I...well...by then.
21:53
It wasn’t that difficult.
21:54
And I mean, she is also...very, very flexible.
21:59
She is very interesting.
22:00
Lot more interesting than I am.
22:05
So it wasn’t that difficult for me.
22:07
It may have been difficult for her, but it wasn’t difficult for me.
22:11
It was...for me, it was, in the sense...like I told you earlier,
22:18
I had never stepped out of the village.
22:22
Not farther than...you know, fifteen, twenty miles.
22:27
Just leaving everybody back home.
22:31
Yeah, I knew, I knew that I married, and now I have a new...I have a
22:36
husband, I have new responsibilities, and I....I...my life is going to
22:42
be totally different from here on.
22:45
So I left everybody back home.
22:48
That was kind of...because I was only eighteen, I was kind of...it
22:53
was hard for me to leave everybody.
22:57
And then I felt like...I’m being taken away from this family to start a new life.
23:06
And I...you know, once I came to the place where he was working, to
23:13
Hyderabad, and then I started liking that place, I started liking my own life.
23:21
This is...I have a responsibility.
23:24
Just like how he felt he has to take care of me.
23:28
And I felt, OK, I’m his wife, I have to take care of him.
23:32
So now...then... then the year later, we had our first daughter,
23:37
so we had more responsibilities.
23:39
Now the husband and the baby, for him, the wife and the baby.
23:44
It’s...I think over the years we had more responsibility and we were
23:52
becoming more mature and tried to deal with everything happening in our life.
24:01
Yeah, that’s what we did.
24:03
And then three years later---first, the next year we had our daughter--and
24:09
then our daughter when she was three, and then we had our second child.
24:15
And then...when I was nine-month, eight-month pregnant or something
24:22
with my son, so I came to my parents’ to have a baby.
24:26
I did the same thing with our daughter also.
24:29
So my mom...my parents brought me to the village.
24:34
It’s very common in India, especially the first baby.
24:39
The parents, you will, you know...are supposed to take you to their home
24:44
and take care of you throughout the delivery, even after few months later
24:50
after the delivery, so by the time you come back to your own place, the
24:57
baby will be three-four months old.
25:02
So yeah, that’s what I did.
25:03
I went for the first child.
25:05
Stayed with my parents for three months.
25:09
And I left him a lot in those days
25:14
because...right after the marriage, a year later, I have to go to my parents’
25:18
house, be there for three months, came back, and again three years later,
25:23
then I had to go back again, stayed with my parents, and had our son.
25:30
Yeah.
25:32
It was...you know, lot of learning experience.
25:33
Lot of learning experience.
25:33
I learned a lot
25:37
in
25:40
the first 5-6 years of my life in Hyderabad.
25:46
I felt like...OK, I’m in charge of everything.
25:51
It
25:54
was nice.
25:55
It really was a good...we made a lot of friends.
25:58
And it was nice, nice to live in Hyderabad.
26:02
We really enjoyed the time
26:07
over there.
26:07
It was always a big move for her, because every place I took her, she came with me.
26:12
And she didn’t know anybody in that place.
26:15
Hyderabad is the same, because people didn’t speak the same language.
26:18
They spoke Telugu and we speak Tamil.
26:22
And it’s harder to...I mean, communicate even with your neighbors, OK?
26:30
Then I came over here and she has to come and get adjusted to this new place.
26:36
So, that’s why--
26:36
So in ‘79, as soon as my first...second child
26:46
was born, OK...he was month-and-a-half old?
26:49
I left India to come here.
26:56
What made you come to the United States?
26:58
You
27:02
know,
27:05
I told you I studied electrical and communication--electronics and
27:10
communications engineering, that’s what it’s called in India, ok.
27:13
And that’s a pretty new field in India.
27:16
There were not very many challenging job opportunities in India
27:21
at that time, for that field.
27:24
Had you been a mechanical or civil engineer, you would
27:27
have found a challenging job.
27:29
For electronics and communications, if you specialize in televisions
27:34
and radars, there are not very many
27:42
jobs.
27:42
This is what really made me to coming to U.S. Looking for challenging
27:50
jobs, go for higher studies.
27:53
Those kind of things.
27:55
And so...I started applying to U.S. schools for higher studies.
28:06
And I couldn’t get it when I graduated from college.
28:12
Then I worked for few years and then tried again.
28:17
In 1979, I applied to 3 or 4 schools in the U.S., couple of them
28:24
in East Coast and one in Oregon.
28:30
I never knew about Oregon except their electrical engineering
28:34
program looked pretty good.
28:36
And the tuition fees were not too expensive at that time.
28:42
I thought I may be able to manage.
28:45
So that’s how I ended up in Oregon.
28:50
It’s mostly to...I mean, looking for challenging opportunities in the field of
29:08
electronics.
29:09
What was the reaction in India of people when you were planning to come to America?
29:14
Mixed.
29:18
My father-in-law didn’t want me to leave India because he was a little
29:24
bit worried I am going to leave his daughter in India for a few years.
29:30
And he wasn’t too happy about it.
29:33
My father...he has been to U.S. once before to visit his son-in-law and
29:42
he thought it would be a good fit for me to do my higher studies here.
29:47
So he--I should say he kind of encouraged me or somewhat neutral.
29:53
So
29:57
some people...all my friends were excited because many of my friends,
30:01
I mean... some...they were also in the process of applying to
30:05
U.S. schools for admissions, OK.
30:07
And some have already...some of my friends who have already
30:12
gone to U.S. when I was working there...it’s kind of mixed feeling.
30:17
I mean some people got really excited when I said I am applying.
30:20
And I got admission to Oregon State.
30:24
And some of them were asking, “Why do you want to leave India?”, you know.
30:31
But I was very, very focused because I wanted to do my graduate studies
30:39
in double E, and I thought the U.S. was the best place to come
30:46
and do it.
30:46
What about for you?
30:47
KR So for me...like he said, our son was just a month old baby, our second
30:55
child, so I was with my parents.
30:59
And I didn’t tell him not to go and I didn’t tell him to go.
31:06
So I was kind of in the neutral way because... And I definitely told him I
31:11
didn’t want to come with him because I didn’t know how everything would be here.
31:18
I mean, bringing the two children.
31:20
And coming to a new place.
31:24
And especially him going to be a student, and I didn’t know how everything
31:30
would be, so I definitely didn’t want to come with him at that time.
31:38
But he was making all the arrangements for him to come.
31:42
So I don’t know whether I should say I was a hundred percent supportive of that.
31:50
I also had the mixed feeling, you know.
31:52
I felt that...yeah, it’s a good opportunity for him to come here.
31:57
That he always wanted to come to U.S.…he always wanted to...because his uncle...his
32:05
uncle was the first one from his side of the family to come to England for higher
32:12
study, to medical school and all that.
32:16
So he always...you know...was a role model for him.
32:20
And then his brother-in-law came to this country.
32:23
His sister’s husband.
32:26
So looking at both of them, and he always thought, OK, I should also go and
32:31
get further...you know, higher study.
32:34
It’ll be more opportunity for me to do lot of challenging work and everything.
32:41
Because he’s always interested in doing challenging work, you know.
32:46
So I was...then OK, I said OK, that’s fine, if that’s what he wanted to do, I
32:53
should...you know, support his wishes.
32:56
And so I stayed with my parents.
33:00
It took three years--
33:04
Almost three years.
33:05
Almost.
33:05
It took almost three years.
33:05
Three years for me to come with the kids.
33:08
He came once...after...little over two-and-a-half years.
33:15
That was the first time we saw again, after two-and-half-years later.
33:21
He even saw the baby.
33:23
He was two-and-a-half years--one month old baby, and then he was
33:26
two-and-half-years old when he came to India.So he applied in between for
33:34
us to come, but some documentation was not there, so they didn’t give me...
33:40
they didn’t issue the visa for me.
33:43
So that took some more time, another six months or so.
33:46
So yeah.
33:48
I ended up staying with my parents, my in-laws.
33:51
And then our daughter started going to school.
33:54
Because there was no good school in the village, so I had to kind of move in
33:59
with my in-laws, because in the city... there was, I mean, good schools in city.
34:05
So I stayed with...I lived with my in-laws, and then every weekend
34:09
I would go stay with my parents.
34:12
So it was kind of going back and forth.
34:15
But...yeah, it was...the kids…
34:18
They stayed in India for…
34:21
Yeah.
34:22
Little over than three years.
34:23
Three years, yeah.
34:26
OK.
34:27
Because Chak was a little over three by the time he came here.
34:30
Right.
34:30
Because...I left India in 1979, September.
34:35
They came here in ‘82 December.
34:37
‘82 December.
34:39
And I went to India in ‘82 June.
34:42
Right.
34:44
And
34:47
when she came here, she came with the green card, okay.
34:53
So after two years of my grad school, I went and worked and I applied for
35:00
a green card and they processed the green card for her as well as for
35:05
the two children at the same time.
35:08
And then she came with the two kids in December of
35:15
1982, few days before Christmas.
35:17
Halloween, Christmas.
35:18
Yeah,
35:21
right.
35:21
So what was it like to move to the United States for each of you?
35:25
What were some of the major culture shocks?
35:30
Cultural shock...First--I came to Corvallis to study, OK.
35:45
This place--I mean the very first day I landed here, OK,
35:49
I mean, I fell in love with
35:53
this place.
35:53
It is so green.
35:54
It’s so nice.
35:55
It’s very, very clean.
35:58
And it’s not as crowded as any of the Indian cities, OK.
36:03
And it’s...for me it was an ideal place to live, OK.
36:10
And it’s...Yes, I missed home.
36:15
I missed her, and the kids, and my...the Indian surroundings.
36:23
But...and then this place looked like a perfect place to live.
36:30
So I was here for two years and then I moved to California for a few years.
36:36
And I always wanted to come back to Corvallis.
36:38
It felt like home to me.
36:40
Home away from home.
36:44
So
36:47
culturally...I don’t...I’m not exactly sure.
36:57
It’s a big difference in the sense, I mean, I didn’t know
37:01
anybody when I came here.
37:03
I mean, no friends, no relatives.
37:07
It’s just you and school.
37:10
And over the years, we started making friends.
37:15
So that was...it’s the loneliness, that’s pretty hard.
37:22
Other than that, I mean, it was overall a
37:29
good move.
37:30
So I came...I came with the two kids in December of 1982.
37:35
So I came through New York and then uncle [Ram] came to pick me up from New York.
37:43
So it was like...December, cold right, coming from the hot place, India, you
37:50
know, weather, and then coming here...and for me, it was a language problem.
37:56
I could not speak English.
37:58
I did not speak English at the time.
38:01
Even though I started reading just before coming here.
38:05
I bought English books...you know, at home and started reading six months
38:12
before, but still, you know, it’s not like something I speak on the daily basis,
38:18
right, so I could not speak English, I could speak very little English.
38:25
It was...it was a big...another...coming to...leaving from a small village
38:33
to Hyderabad was a big step.
38:35
And then from Hyderabad to U.S...that’s even bigger move for me.
38:42
But luckily, you know he was in California at that time, he already
38:47
had few friends who were very close and then speaking the same language.
38:53
So when I came, I fell in with the...you know, the culture right
38:59
away, I mean because they were there.
39:02
They were always there for anything I need or anywhere I needed to go.
39:08
Or somebody to even talk to.
39:11
They spoke the same language.
39:15
The same language, you know.
39:15
It helped her.
39:15
It really helped me.
39:16
And...so...then I slowly start liking the place.
39:21
Like he said, I really like the cleanliness of this place.
39:26
I mean, the...less crowded.
39:28
It’s not like in India.
39:30
The weather is nice.
39:31
It’s not too hot.
39:34
No mosquitoes.
39:37
No mosquitoes.
39:40
It was nice.
39:40
I mean culturally it was different because...the language.
39:41
I can’t really talk to too many American people here.
39:49
It took some time for me.
39:51
But slowly, you know.
39:53
Then I started going to school.
39:57
And I did my high school here.
40:01
And then I took evening classes, took some computer classes, some accounting courses
40:07
and all that, uncle [Ram] would...I didn’t learn driving for quite some time.
40:13
I didn’t want to drive because I was kind of scared to
40:17
drive in California.
40:18
That took some time for me to...I wanted to get to settle down in the
40:24
place and get to know everybody.
40:27
Feel comfortable first before I started to do anything on my own.
40:33
So I had to depend on uncle on for almost for everything.
40:37
Because, first of all, I didn’t drive.
40:41
That’s a big drawback in this country, right.
40:44
If you don’t know driving, then it’s very...you know, hard to go anywhere.
40:52
So then, slowly, you know, I gained my confidence there, by slowly...going
40:58
to school, and then I start meeting more people at school and then
41:03
I started talking little more.
41:07
I didn’t have that much nervous like how I used to be.
41:12
So I slowly start talking to people, making friends.
41:15
So it took some time for me to... My kids were--actually--they were a big
41:22
influence on me because...they went to school here, right, so they would correct
41:28
me if I say something wrong in English and even the way I pronounce, you know.
41:34
In India, our pronunciation is a little bit different.
41:38
Our accent is different, right?
41:40
They will correct.
41:40
So the kids would correct me.
41:42
I learned a lot from my kids, actually.
41:45
And I used to watch a lot of TV, to...just to learn English.
41:50
You know, I used to watch so much TV.
41:53
After the kids went to school, I watched a lot of TV.
41:53
And then he [Ram] was giving me English lessons in the evening.
41:54
So it was good.
41:54
I grew up.
41:56
I learned a lot.
41:58
And then I
42:09
really started liking this place.
42:12
I made more friends.
42:14
I felt really comfortable after a few years of coming to this country.
42:20
By the time we got settled down in California and she got comfortable in
42:26
California with our friends circle, I decided to move back to Corvallis.
42:30
She has never been...well, she has been to Corvallis once before,
42:34
because we came to visit our friends when we lived in California.
42:39
And then I said, “Oh, I’m...we are moving to Corvallis.” And she wasn’t too happy.
42:45
Yeah.
42:47
Because leaving California...with all our friends, okay.
42:50
It’’s a bigger Indian community and she had quite a few friends over there.
42:56
I decided to move back to Corvallis because I felt...Corvallis is a
43:05
good place to bring up the children.
43:07
Safe place.
43:07
Safe.
43:11
Good schools.
43:12
If
43:14
you remember, I mean, in the mid-80s, there was so much...drugs at school…
43:21
In California?
43:22
In California.
43:23
Where did you live in California?
43:24
We lived in…
43:25
Santa Clara.
43:28
Santa Clara, San Jose, London.
43:30
We lived for three months in Sacramento.
43:32
Yeah, Sacramento.
43:32
I think that’s where the schools were...you know...
43:35
No, generally.
43:36
I mean, they were about to go to middle school, and we felt that...bringing up
43:43
children in Corvallis would be better than bringing up children in one of
43:47
those...California...I mean, schools.
43:48
Big cities.
43:49
Because of the...I mean, you hear about drugs all the time in schools, OK.
43:55
And Corvallis may be a safer place, better place to bring up the children.
44:00
And that was one of the main motives to come back to Corvallis.
44:06
As I told you before, I always liked this place.
44:09
So I looked for a job at HP in Corvallis.
44:12
So, as soon as I got a job at HP, I decided to move back.
44:17
OK, that was a big move for her because she knew one of my friend who
44:24
we visited earlier and they have also visited us back in California, but
44:29
other than that we didn’t know anybody.
44:32
So that’s a big
44:37
move for her.
44:38
So...I have Corvallis a little later
44:49
on.
44:49
You talked a little about the drugs that were being used in the 1980s.
44:53
What other things do you remember were happening in the U.S.
44:56
politically when you were here?
44:58
Oh!
44:58
Oh, there were….okay,
45:01
going back, in the 1980s, when I was a student, I came here in ‘79, 80s...and
45:07
Jimmy Carter was very unpopular.
45:11
And Reagan got elected as president.
45:14
And ‘80, I was here in Corvallis when Mt. St. Helens erupted.
45:19
Oh, OK.
45:20
OK?
45:20
And we could see ash, I mean a layer of ash on the windshield in Corvallis.
45:33
It was...yeah...I never thought about
45:39
eruptions of that kind before.
45:43
It was quite interesting.
45:46
And I...when I was in California, I mean...we encountered the first
45:51
earthquake, which I remember.
45:54
Right.
45:54
First time ever.
45:55
I was at work and there was an earthquake.
45:58
I went under the desk.
46:01
Yeah.
46:02
And then...yeah, and then there was a major earthquake in Oakland.
46:02
We were living in Sacramento at that time.
46:02
I’m sure it was…
46:03
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
46:05
That’s when the...
46:14
The whole bridge fell.
46:15
The bridge fell.
46:17
Right, the car stretches, hanging.
46:18
We could see the car going down, right?
46:21
Down.
46:21
The TV, yeah, right.
46:23
That was a major earthquake in Oakland at the time.
46:30
What were the major events during the time?
46:34
I think that was ‘81 or ‘82, the San Francisco Forty-niners
46:40
won their first Super Bowl.
46:42
OK, that’s pretty significant!
46:57
Did you ever face prejudice from Americans based on the fact that either you were
47:02
Indian or that you were immigrants?
47:08
Not really, okay.
47:15
In the Bay Area, when I worked for National and Intel, the workplace
47:21
was completely, very, very diverse.
47:25
There were Indians, there were local American...whites and people from China.
47:35
From
47:38
various parts of the world, okay.
47:40
I mean, if you enter any of the Intel sites, and look at the
47:44
groups, it’s very, very diverse.
47:48
In fact, I worked for a manager who was from Pakistan at the time and when
47:55
I worked for National, the guy just moved from England to manage this group.
48:02
So, we’re a bunch of people from different parts of the world.
48:06
Never felt discriminated or anything.
48:13
When I moved to HP it was different, because there were fewer...very
48:17
few...at least HP Corvallis site--didn’t have very many others.
48:23
It’s mostly local Americans...whites, few Indians here and there.
48:33
But discrimination, probably not.
48:36
Not really.
48:38
What about you?
48:39
Yeah, I never felt any discrimination.
48:42
When we were in California, I didn’t definitely feel anything because there
48:49
was large Indian community and other
48:54
diverse people, right.
48:57
So I definitely didn’t feel anything.
49:01
After coming here, it’s a small town.
49:04
People were...I mean the adult people were very friendly, and their... the
49:09
kids, you know, I remember, they were very curious about if I wore a sari and
49:14
go out, they’ll be kind of staring at me.
49:17
“What is this?” You know, if they see me. “What is that?” Other
49:18
than that, you know people are
49:25
so friendly.
49:26
I never felt that...people were discriminating me or not wanting to
49:32
talk to me because I am different...I never anything like that.
49:37
Never felt that way.
49:39
Even at work, we have so many...I work with so many people, American people.
49:45
It is diverse, HP is a really diverse workplace.
49:52
We have all kinds of people.
49:54
I mean, lot of
49:57
American.
49:57
They’re all very nice, very nice.
49:58
I always feel they are nice people.
50:02
You know, nice people are everywhere, right?
50:05
It is not just in your own country.
50:08
Nice people are everywhere.
50:10
So I never felt anything...intimidated.
50:16
I never felt they are treating me in the bad way or anything.
50:21
I never felt that way.
50:23
It’s always good feeling about how people are nice over here.
50:33
So...what was
50:39
kind
50:50
of surprising about Corvallis?
50:52
Well, you know, there...because I had
50:55
so many people...so by the way, our third child was born in
51:01
California, so that was another excitement/addition into our family.
51:07
And I meeted so many friends over there.
51:13
We were getting together.
51:14
Lot of get-togethers.
51:16
The temple, we used to go to the temple.
51:18
Friend’s house.
51:22
Just...you know, we kind of settled down in that place.
51:25
We were very comfortable with the surrounding and the people over
51:30
there and friends over there.
51:33
And then we had to move to Corvallis.
51:36
So because it was a small town in the Corvallis, I didn’t
51:39
like it in the first place.
51:41
I felt that...you know, there’s nothing here to go, other
51:46
than the university here.
51:49
Very few places you can go to.
51:52
For everything, you have to go to Portland.
51:56
We used to go to so many Indian restaurants in the Bay Area
52:01
and there was another drawback over here when we moved here.
52:05
And also not too many--our kids didn’t have that many Indian
52:10
friends, because there were not too many kids on their own...same-age
52:17
kids when we moved to Corvallis.
52:20
So it was kind of hard on them...they didn’t have any...it was hard for them
52:26
to get exposure to Indian culture.
52:30
Other than just, you know, the home, they were following everything we
52:36
do, the Indian culture at home.
52:39
Outside they were following the American culture, because the
52:42
friend circle were Americans.
52:46
So that was kind of hard on them.
52:49
It felt that...you know, they would have had more...the exposure, Indian culture
52:55
exposure if we were still in California.
53:01
There were larger Indian--
53:01
Large Indian community.
53:01
Community over there.
53:01
And their own, each kids.
53:01
There were lot of
53:09
friends, their same age, growing up.
53:13
Of Indian immigrants.
53:15
Indian immigrants, yeah.
53:17
It took some time for me... but it didn’t take too long, you know.
53:23
But...it was...I started liking this place because the place is so nice and green.
53:33
It’s such a beautiful...you know, town.
53:36
It’s a small town, but it’s very beautiful.
53:39
People are nice.
53:40
Again.
53:40
So how was Corvallis different at that time from how it is now?
53:44
Actually, it hasn’t changed a whole lot.
53:48
I mean, it has gotten a little bit bigger.
53:51
When I came in ‘79, I think the population was more like 37, 38,000 maybe.
54:00
And then in ‘88, it was more like 45.
54:06
Now it maybe is something like 55,000, maybe 57.
54:10
I mean, it has grown but not that much.
54:14
It hasn’t changed a whole lot.
54:18
It’s still the nice place that it was when I came in ‘79.
54:21
There are more buildings at OSU.
54:27
The campus looks still pretty green.
54:32
Culturally, there are more...I mean...diverse restaurants,
54:39
Indian restaurants, some few more Italian restaurants.
54:44
Few more shopping centers than before.
54:47
But otherwise it is still pretty
54:52
much the same.
54:53
More homes, I think right?
54:53
Yeah, little bit.
54:54
Lot more homes.
54:55
I mean...but not
55:01
a whole lot of changes.
55:02
So...how has the country as a whole changed from then till now?
55:16
That’s a good question.
55:17
How has it...how has it changed…
55:21
Well, this year, election is being so chaotic.
55:25
I mean, we have never seen election like this, right?
55:30
Not like this before.
55:31
Not like this before.
55:33
Oh, and I’m so happy we have
55:42
women selected...nomination for the...you know, Democratic party.
55:46
For the major party.
55:47
Major party.
55:48
That’s a big change.
55:49
I’m really looking forward to that.
55:49
Yeah,
55:53
other than that, I…
55:58
I mean, if you ask for a big moment, like when Obama got elected.
56:02
OK, that was a big moment.
56:02
Yeah,
56:05
that was a big moment.
56:05
I mean...we never...we wouldn’t have thought that…
56:08
The African-American…
56:09
African-American will be president of this country.
56:14
That was a big change.
56:15
That was really a big change.
56:19
Clinton being the nominee of the major...one of the two major parties this
56:24
year is a big change too...and...yeah, those are the two I could think of, okay.
56:32
Hope more changes would come.
56:32
Good changes.
56:32
In the future, good changes.
56:40
So how has India changed from when you left?
56:44
Oh, India has changed a lot in this time period.
56:49
If...actually
56:54
when I said earlier that I came here because I wanted to
56:56
look...do a challenging job.
57:00
There’s no need for Indians to come here anymore, OK, because there are
57:03
a lot of challenging opportunities for them to do in India now.
57:09
And because they’re doing pretty good stuff in India these days, okay.
57:16
Because I used to work with Indian engineers, while I was working here,
57:21
okay, and they are doing just as good as what we’re doing here in some field.
57:26
So I feel India has really changed quite a bit in the area of technology.
57:34
There is no need for engineers to come to U.S. looking for
57:40
challenging opportunities.
57:41
Challenging job
57:48
opportunities.
57:48
It’s the same thing.
57:51
Oh, I do want to add one thing, though.
57:53
In the early 90s,
58:18
right?
58:34
We became U.S. citizens.
58:36
That was really…
58:36
Yeah, I think we became…
58:36
Big, happy.
58:36
‘92, ‘93?
58:37
‘92, ‘93 timeframe, we became U.S. citizens?
58:37
And that...along that time, we became U.S. citizen.
58:37
That was a big change.
58:37
So it was a...big...we were so happy and glad to be…
58:37
Big change for us.
58:37
Big change for us, so that was a big moment for us to
58:37
become citizen of this country.
58:37
So we’re glad we did that.
58:37
So what was the first election you voted in?
58:37
Do you remember?
58:37
Okay.
58:38
I don’t know.
58:38
Because...we became U.S. citizens in ‘92.
58:38
And I must have voted for Clinton the second time.
58:45
Clinton the second time.
58:46
I think.
58:47
Yeah, yeah between ‘92 and 2000.
58:52
So I must have voted for Clinton during the second time,
58:55
not the first time around.
58:58
‘96 elections probably.
59:00
First presidential elections in ‘96.
59:03
So I voted Democratic.
59:04
I am a card-carrying Democratic
59:18
party member.
59:18
I wanted to actually ask about your kids.
59:23
How was it for your kids going to school here, growing up here?
59:28
How
59:35
do you think that impacted them?
59:37
Their schooling, not knowing many Indians here.
59:43
They adapted to both places very well.
59:48
So...you know, in the beginning when we moved here from
59:52
California...so, I was kind of thinking, how they are going to be.
59:59
Of course, we were always worried, they should have good friends,
1:00:04
we’re hoping...you don’t want them to fall in bad circle of friends.
1:00:12
So we were really...worried about that.
1:00:15
But luckily, you know, they chose their friends, you know, who studied well, who
1:00:22
are going to school well and all that.
1:00:26
So they had good friends.
1:00:27
They didn’t really affect them in any way, so they were pretty
1:00:32
happy with their friends.
1:00:34
They didn’t have a whole lot of friends.
1:00:36
But they had...the friends they had…
1:00:38
Good friends.
1:00:39
Good friends.
1:00:39
The friends whom we can trust them to know them well, that they will be good for our
1:00:49
children to have friends in their life.
1:00:53
So it didn’t really make any big impact on them…they adjusted really well.
1:00:58
They adjusted pretty well.
1:00:59
Yeah, they adjusted pretty well.
1:01:01
It didn’t affect them in any way.
1:01:03
They turned out to be good kids.
1:01:07
They all had a college education.
1:01:10
We’re so proud of them, you know, now that they’re all working.
1:01:15
They work by themselves.
1:01:18
So all married and the two of them have already children and Madhu, our
1:01:23
youngest son, he got married three years ago...couple of years ago.
1:01:29
And they don’t have any children yet.
1:01:32
So yeah, we are so proud of them.
1:01:34
The achievement they made.
1:01:36
And we are so happy we were able to provide them everything they
1:01:41
needed and brought them good kids.
1:01:46
We are very proud of them.
1:01:55
So what change or impact do you think you both had on your work,
1:02:02
or Corvallis, or the community?
1:02:04
In Corvallis, okay, I mean, we have to say we are very...pretty proud
1:02:04
of celebrating this Indian community event, called music festival.
1:02:04
It’s done once in three years.
1:02:04
Oh, the Thyagaraja Festival?
1:02:05
Yeah, Thyagaraja Festival.
1:02:05
Yeah, Thyagaraja Aradhana.
1:02:05
Yes, we are a big supporter of that.
1:02:05
And the Indian community has grown, okay.
1:02:05
We tried to get involved in the Indian community when
1:02:50
we knew people...we tried to get them involved as well to
1:03:00
the extent that’s possible.
1:03:02
At work, I have always worked on some fun stuff which is state-of-the-art, always.
1:03:12
Before I quit we were working on cameras that are going to go into
1:03:21
automobiles.
1:03:21
There’s already back-up cameras in cars.
1:03:23
But one we are working on will have four or five cameras in an automobile.
1:03:32
So I was working on the design of those cameras as part of a team, okay.
1:03:38
I always worked on the leading edge of technology.
1:03:42
I worked on the microprocessor for Intel and then...computers were just coming
1:03:48
out and personal computers were just coming out...and then I worked at...ICEs
1:03:56
for the printers.
1:03:57
And the PC printers were just then becoming popular.
1:04:01
Worked on chips for digital cameras, okay.
1:04:06
So I was a little bit...and always I had the newest products technology-wise.
1:04:14
It’s always fun.
1:04:18
You?
1:04:21
To me, like he said, about Aradhana, I’m very glad that we do it, we get
1:04:29
a chance to celebrate that function.
1:04:32
And also the Dhussera,
1:04:35
Navaratri celebration we do, it brings the whole Indian community people together.
1:04:43
It’s just...North, East, West, South, people from all over from India,
1:04:48
we have here, living in Corvallis.
1:04:51
That one festival, I always see, bring everybody together.
1:04:56
We have so much fun, you know, nine days, I’m sure your mom would
1:05:02
have told you about that.
1:05:02
We celebrate the nine days of dussehra every year.
1:05:08
All of the ladies, we all have fun.
1:05:11
It’s nice.
1:05:12
I’m so glad that...you know, being in the small town, it’s possible to bring
1:05:18
everybody together...I don’t think it’ll be possible...places like California, the
1:05:23
bigger cities...because they all...they have their own group of friends.
1:05:28
But it’s possible, we are able to do in this small village.
1:05:33
Not small village, small town.
1:05:34
Yeah, small, not small village.
1:05:36
Small town.
1:05:37
I’m thinking about my village.
1:05:39
It’s the small town.
1:05:40
You know, bring everyone together.
1:05:43
And everybody’s having lot of fun.
1:05:47
As far as my work goes.
1:05:49
I enjoy what I do at work.
1:05:53
And...I work well with people, you know, I have a lot of friends.
1:05:58
All kinds of friends at HP.
1:06:00
So, they treat me very nicely, so I’m very, very happy where I am.
1:06:10
And do you want to share--what are some of the best memories you had
1:06:14
in the United States or Corvallis?
1:06:15
This is the last one?
1:06:18
Yeah.
1:06:18
Best memories in U.S.?
1:06:21
Or in Corvallis.
1:06:30
In Corvallis.
1:06:30
Who’s going to go first?
1:06:31
So in Corvallis.
1:06:31
Well, in U.S.
1:06:33
In U.S. So we always enjoy travelling.
1:06:39
Not only here.
1:06:41
In, around the world, you know.
1:06:42
We have gone to Europe a number of times.
1:06:46
And we want to do a lot more travelling in the future.
1:06:52
That’s one thing we both really enjoy doing that.
1:06:55
There is something...you know, here, is so much easier, everything,
1:07:00
you can get it done, everything.
1:07:02
Online.
1:07:03
You know, just think about it, and book the ticket, and then you just go.
1:07:09
You do...you are to do so much already, you are able to see so much.
1:07:13
So...yeah, we always enjoy our trip.
1:07:17
We had a...we made a trip to Costa Rica a few years back.
1:07:22
Just a while ago we went to Italy for three weeks.
1:07:27
We like to enjoy...travel together.
1:07:31
If you are asking for the best moment in U.S. for me, OK, when
1:07:37
Madhu was born, our third child.
1:07:39
OK?
1:07:40
Because for the other two kids, I mean, as she was telling before, I mean when
1:07:44
the two kids were born, I mean, she went to her home and then the kids
1:07:47
were born, and then they will send me a letter, telling that, okay...
1:07:53
“You have a girl.”
1:07:53
You have a baby boy or baby girl, or something and then it will be a
1:07:57
few weeks before I go and see them.
1:08:00
Whereas when Madhu
1:08:02
was born, I was there when the baby was born and I could hold him right
1:08:05
then, as soon as the baby was born.
1:08:08
That was the biggest moment for me in U.S.
1:08:15
Of course there were others.
1:08:16
It should be mine too, right?
1:08:19
But for you, the other two.
1:08:23
For me, I mean, because I was there, that was a
1:08:29
big moment.
1:08:30
Because the kids getting married, that comes later.
1:08:33
Oh,
1:08:35
that’s true.
1:08:36
Oh, and also, the grandchildren.
1:08:39
Big moments for us.
1:08:41
So we have five grandchildren.
1:08:43
Three or four granddaughters and one grandson.
1:08:46
So we are so...you know, lucky to have grandchildren.
