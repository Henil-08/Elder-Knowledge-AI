00:00
OK.
00:01
As for growing up in Pasadena the reason I grew up there was my father;
00:09
is where he got his education from and graduated from Pasadena high
00:14
school then went to Coop College;
00:19
Coop college now changed its name to Cal Tech.
00:24
That’s the reason I was born in Pasadena.
00:30
I actually was born on the East side of town; in the old days it was?
00:36
Park, but no one uses that name any more.
00:39
When I was in second grade I moved across town to the western
00:45
part and went to grammar school at uh Lincoln elementary school.
00:52
Finished there and went to McKenzie high school then I went to what
00:59
they call Pasadena Senior College.
01:02
People call them community colleges now.
01:06
On my birthday the 27th when I just turned 18 I dropped out of
01:11
school because I was going to get incarcerated by the federal government.
01:16
I
01:19
was in what they call Tellary relocation camp.
01:26
And then was transferred to the Hilo relocation camp.
01:31
That’s a misnomer because they’re…the machine guns were pointed inwards, the
01:41
barbed wire makes you stay in, so they call them relocation camps but they
01:48
were actually concentration camps.
01:52
And my brother and I both wanted to go to school so we applied at the American
01:57
Friends Association created a, what they call, a nisi relocation center.
02:04
And I was first admitted to Bowling Green in Ohio, now called Bowling
02:12
Green University, but then college, but the townspeople wouldn’t let me in.
02:17
So my brother and I decided we’d try all places and both of us were accepted at
02:26
the University of Nebraska and that’s the reason I went to University of Nebraska.
02:32
And actually we left the relocation camp and we got on the train and as
02:40
soon as we got on the train we noticed someone keeping an eye on is; it was
02:44
an FBI agent to make sure we weren’t bothered until we got to Kansas City
02:52
then he disappeared then in Kansas City we took the train to Lincoln.
02:58
And I was there until my
03:04
last half of my junior year I finally got orders to report
03:10
for the military induction.
03:13
I can remember my brother was already finished and uh we went through induction
03:19
of course in Leavenworth Kansas and you were allowed to theoretically choose what
03:27
branch of the service you wanted to go into, but you really
03:30
had no choice but the army.
03:33
My brother was an engineer and he couldn’t get into the navy period so.
03:39
I ended up with the four point second regimental combat team and
03:43
you probably never heard of it.
03:45
no
03:45
It’s the most decorated unit for its size and number of days
03:50
in battle in World War two.
03:53
And you have to realize that a regiment is one third the size of a division
03:59
and in that regiment is over 5,000 decorations of which 20 of em was
04:05
congressional metals of honor and many divisions did not reach that level.
04:11
But the casualties were quite great and the turnover was about 320 percent
04:19
Oh wow.
04:19
And it was the unit that rescued the lost battalion during World War 2.
04:27
I was in Italy and in Italy and then the war was over but we were
04:37
the last combat units in Italy.
04:38
As soon as I came home and as soon as I got home I’d only stayed over the
04:45
weekend, took the plane, went back to Nebraska to get back into school.
04:49
I was about 5 weeks late.
04:52
My major professor pulled all the cards for me.
04:55
He told the other profs that I would be in.
04:57
I took the plane in Omaha, Lincoln had no airport at that time.
05:04
And then the next morning after I stayed at a hotel close to the
05:11
airport and got on the bus and went back to Nebraska and finished up.
05:19
I was the only person in the class, my graduating class, that
05:24
had no job after I finished.
05:26
No one would hire me.
05:28
And I didn’t know what to do.
05:30
I said, well, I’ll go back home.
05:32
My parents moved back to to Pasadena and I stayed with my parents and I looked
05:41
up one of my old friends I went to school with who had an advanced degree
05:45
in microbiology, and uh he says well, if you’re gonna go to graduate school you
05:53
might as well learn viral techniques.
05:57
Because in those days viruses were not studied at the
06:01
graduate or undergraduate level.
06:04
So I decided to learn some techniques and went in to the boss man who was chairman
06:12
at USC of microbiology and parasitology and he says no I won’t take you.
06:20
And I says, and then, my friend talked to him again and he says, ok I will take
06:26
you on the condition that you get three letters of recommendation that were good.
06:33
So I got three profs back at Nebraska.
06:37
He got em and called me and said OK yes can come to work.
06:41
For nothing, you know?
06:43
So I learned all the viral techniques, especially cerebral inoculation
06:48
of mice all the way up to monkeys.
06:53
And after I learned all that Shamron called me and says how would you
06:59
like a teaching assistantship.
07:02
I says fine.
07:03
Before he says, well, come to USC, look around and see what you think.
07:08
And the reason the wanted me
07:12
was all the GIs were coming back and they didn’t have enough
07:17
TAs.
07:17
So they gave me a teaching assistantship and I finished up at uh
07:24
USC in 2 years and didn’t know what to do.
07:29
And I says, well, I’ll go to Berkeley.
07:32
So uh, my friends joined me and we drove up to Berkley and I
07:39
knew one of the students there.
07:41
And he says, don’t come here.
07:43
For one thing there are 17 PhD students, 10 have completed all the course work,
07:51
and of the 10 seven had lab space and three were waiting for lab space so
07:56
that they could do their thesis work.
07:58
So I came back and to USC and told my professor that and one of them says
08:06
well why don’t you go to Scripps, so that’s why I went to Scripps.
08:11
But at Scripps,
08:15
I uh,
08:18
started working in with, there was on post-doc and two technicians and another
08:28
student ahead of me, but uh the post doc quit and the uh my friend that
08:36
was a PhD student also he left on a Fulbright to go to Sweden to study for
08:45
a year so I took over the whole lab.
08:49
And then in those days research expeditions were null and void.
08:58
Want to know why no one went out?
09:00
Because all the researchers before that were in the 1890s
09:02
and 1880s, there were none.
09:05
And then, came
09:10
the depression and nobody had any money to go out.
09:14
Scripps finally decided to go out.
09:18
The director Roger Rebellm
09:22
got barely enough money from the office of naval research to take off.
09:27
So I was on the first expedition and I was also lucky I jointed the Gelity
09:34
deep sea expedition and after that I joined transpacific expedition.
09:42
That was fine I enjoyed all of em.
09:45
But it took me longer to get out of Scripps.
09:47
5 years instead of the regular 3.
09:51
But it was worthwhile I saw the pacific and uh during the mid pacific expedition
10:01
we went .4 degrees north of the equator in to Honolulu and into Bikini and I
10:11
was put ashore with 4 other fellas.
10:15
And they left me in charge of doing chemistry and I did the chemistry.
10:20
They left us with 3 days of food and said we’ll be back for you,
10:24
but they didn’t bother coming back.
10:26
It was seven days before they came back.
10:29
We had lots of water to drink but we didn’t have any food so the
10:35
uh video operator would go out
10:42
and go spear fishing and catch fish.
10:46
There’s a picture of with a blowfish
10:48
yes
10:48
Is that, is that uh
10:50
yes!
10:50
That’s a puffer fish from Bikini.
10:52
And uh, one day he caught an octopus.
10:56
I’d never cooked an octopus before and I didn’t realize that you
11:00
have to cook an octopus a very short time or it gets real tough.
11:04
Well, our teeth got a good workout.
11:10
[laughter].
11:10
After that I went back to Scripps again.
11:12
Then the Gallatee expedition was Danish.
11:16
I got on it and I flew from San Diego to San Francisco then over to Honalulu and
11:27
as soon as I got to Honalulu a telegraph arrived and it says go get a navy uniform.
11:35
So I went to the uh pearl harbor and I had to have a what they
11:43
call a uh technicians license.
11:47
It’s
11:49
a little square bronze that you put on the uh collar of the.
11:56
. .and I come by and there weren’t any more.
12:00
One of the fellas that was there was a tech and he says I have one extra one.
12:06
Well you’re supposed to have two so he gave me one.
12:09
But I says well if that’s the case I might as well buy a uniform and so I
12:16
flew from there to uh the Fiji islands and then to New Zealand and from
12:26
new Zealand I went to the kermadack islands and back to new Zealand and
12:28
then we got on the boat and rode back to the kermadack islands and
12:34
then we went to American Samoa and in American Samoa we had three stow-aways.
12:44
And so the captain of the ship didn’t know what to do so he put them
12:48
on an island just north of Samoa.
12:51
And then we went from there to uh
12:53
Who were the stow aways?
12:55
I don’t remember their names from uh, two young kids who wanted to go to Hawaii.
13:05
In Samoa
13:08
there’s nothing for the kids to do.
13:12
By the way when you talk about the various south sea islanders they
13:19
all talk about beautiful women.
13:20
It’s not true [laughter].
13:25
The beautiful women are the half-caste.
13:31
The half-caste children are real good looking, especially the girls.
13:37
And we came back to Honolulu and then to San Francisco and then to
13:45
uh, oh, near Monterrey bay where uh,
13:54
Dr. Boleen, the ichthyologist
13:57
was located, Stanford located, then finally down to Scripps.
14:03
But when I was in San Francisco displaying the uh
14:10
ship uh research possibilities and one elderly lady came in with a group of
14:21
people while we explained how everything worked, what we did and so forth.
14:28
Then after the end she told me, for a Dane you speak awfully good English.
14:38
[laughter].
14:39
Well, I let that go.
14:42
And the third trip I made
14:45
on Scripps was um with the Gallac expedition
14:50
TransPac.
14:52
Went North to Alaska then to Adak, off Kamchatka to Tokyo, and we were
15:01
in Tokyo, we had an audience the emperor, so I actually met the emperor.
15:10
And uh the funniest thing was that uh he asked us to come in because
15:18
he was an amateur marine biologist.
15:21
So that’s why we had a chance to meet him.
15:24
Well from there my major professor had made arrangements
15:29
for me to go to Kyoto to visit.
15:33
. . am I getting too far ahead?
15:34
No, no, I’m just, I’m sorry, I’m just checking the time on this.
15:37
Anyway, to Kyoto to meet a marine microbiologist in Japan who did
15:46
his work on uh cellulose digesters.
15:50
The reason he was working on cellulose digesters was that in the old days all
15:56
the nets were made from hemp and not artificial material so the nets would rot.
16:06
I went to see him and he lived on the opposite side of Japan on the
16:13
western seaboard so I took a train with him and went to, pardon me,
16:20
to pacific almighty, I came back.
16:27
That’s why I told you when I talked to all these individuals scientifically
16:33
they all laughed at me because I spoke Japanese like a woman.
16:40
I learn my Japanese from my mother.
16:43
My father never spoke to us in Japanese, so it was different.
16:49
And that’s what I did at Scripps.
16:51
So I took 5 years to get out instead of 3, but it was worth it I thought.
16:57
And from there, let’s see, what did I do during the great depression,
17:04
yes I remember the great depression
17:08
when I went off to work because I got paid two and a half cents an hour.
17:13
That was supposed to be good money.
17:15
What kind of work?
17:17
Well I worked in fruit stands in various markets; those were jobs we
17:22
were allowed to have, and I could never get a job as a newspaper delivery boy.
17:33
I tried by the only thing that ever happened is that I would substitute
17:38
every once in awhile for somebody that couldn’t come in and make his route.
17:43
But that was OK.
17:45
And then I got incarcerated when war broke out.
17:50
I got incarcerated with my family and then we first went Wynona artillery
17:59
relocation center and from there we moved to the Hilo relocation center
18:07
south of phoenix about fifty miles and that’s where I stayed until I got out.
18:17
And when I got out my brother and I tried to go to various schools but the
18:23
University of Nebraska was the only one that accepted us so we went there.
18:29
And then while we were there we got our notices to report for
18:36
the services.
18:37
We went from there to fort Leavenworth Kansas and we went
18:43
from there to camp ? where
18:48
I took my basic training and for someone who ?, before you
18:56
went into uh fort uh [pause]
19:05
oh, what was it, Kansas, anyway we were delayed in going they just held us back so
19:15
we didn’t get in the service right away.
19:18
I was lucky because those extra months made it possible for me to
19:24
join the 442nd regimental combat team.
19:30
After the war was over.
19:33
And uh that delay of one month, otherwise I would have been in the thick of
19:38
things when they broke the gothic line because they were used to spearhead
19:43
all the uh forward movement of the troops in Italy as well as France.
19:52
Was the, uh, 442nd, um, were there other people of Japanese ancestry?
19:58
Just some of the officers.
20:00
Not all of them, but most of them.
20:03
I?
20:03
in my company, second platoon, second squad and I ended up being a bar man.
20:10
You know what a bar man is?
20:12
A browning automatic rifle?
20:13
Yup.
20:14
I carried that and uh one of my, I didn’t know him, I’ve written him a couple
20:24
times, one of the bar men in my platoon won the congressional metal of honor.
20:32
One of my childhood friends in K company also won the congressional metal of honor.
20:40
And uh
20:42
went to Italy then came home and went back to Nebraska and finished up.
20:49
Came home and no one would hire me that’s why I started looking around
20:56
for something to do and I ended up learning viral techniques as the county
21:03
hospital that did all that kind of work.
21:06
And from there I
21:13
went to USC and the reason is that they didn’t have enough
21:16
teaching assistants they had all the GIs that were coming home.
21:21
And I finished there in three years and didn’t know what to do and started
21:26
to go to Berkley and, I told her, if I went to Berkley seventeen phd students
21:34
and the other from across from, seven had space and three were waiting, so I came
21:42
back and told my professors that it was too crowded I didn’t want to go there.
21:47
I didn’t want to wait that long.
21:50
One of them sent me to his major professor at Scripps.
21:54
That’s how I went to Scripps.
21:55
What, um,
21:59
got you started with your work on microbial um extremophiles?
22:05
Microbial what?
22:09
Your work on um uh the uh extremophiles, the
22:12
Extremophiles.
22:19
Yah.
22:19
Was that just a matter of chance?
22:20
No, it wasn’t a matter of chance.
22:24
It was because no one else wanted to go off to sea for such long
22:28
periods of time because they were married and I was the only one.
22:34
So the first trip on the alkie, I mean, mid pacific expedition I
22:41
was the first to take core samples uh beyond the continental shelf.
22:48
Wow.
22:49
So, in those days
22:54
you’d just have a small core sampler.
22:56
Then all of a sudden the kuhlenberg core sampler came about.
23:01
I don’t know if you know what the kuhlenberg is.
23:04
No.
23:05
It’s a long one.
23:09
You could get up to about 70 meters and get the sediment.
23:14
They had a piston inside of it.
23:16
When it would touch the surface of the soil the piston would come up
23:20
that would help hold it then we’d pull it out, then we’d push it out,
23:26
then I’d take my samples there.
23:30
And that’s how we learned that there such things as extremophiles.
23:38
The organisms that require pressure in order to grow.
23:43
So my major professor and I worked on those and we published on that,
23:47
on those extremophiles and then,
23:54
when did I cut away, 62, I came to OSU after uh
24:02
finishing Scripps.
24:03
Went to University of Houston, couldn’t stand it there.
24:05
I left and went back to Nebraska.
24:09
I was there three years and they asked me to come out here.
24:13
Well, when I came I was working on pressure and temperature
24:18
interaction on microbes.
24:23
I thought I needed something else besides that.
24:27
So I decided to look for cold loving bacteria, sacrophiles, but
24:35
all my students laughed at me.
24:37
I brought three students out from Nebraska out here and they said you’ll never find
24:46
them.
24:47
And after reading the literature the reason I realized something was wrong
24:51
was that none of the people that were trying to find cold loving bacteria
24:56
would take their sample of water and put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.
25:02
They’d always bring it back up to room temperature and never realized
25:06
that room temperature is too hot for them and it would kill them.
25:10
So I took an ordinary bottle like this, but not plastic, glass and put
25:18
some yeast extract on the bottom, about a gram of yeast extract.
25:22
Fill it half way, sterilized it, put the cap on, and told a technician in
25:31
oceanography to take a sample of water below the thermocline and put it in
25:38
there and put it in the refrigerator.
25:40
When he got back to Newport I came out and put it in the
25:42
refrigerator and picked it up.
25:44
That’s how I actually on sacrophiles.
25:49
When I started all three of my students that were phd students decided
25:56
they wanted to quit their research problem and work on sacrophile.
25:58
I said no, by contract on research grants, you have to finish what
26:03
you’re doing, but that’s when sacrophiles came into existence.
26:11
So, I worked on that for quite awhile.
26:14
So you found those when you were at Oregon State?
26:18
Yah.
26:20
What was the response in the research community here to that discovery?
26:28
As my uh discoveries on a lot of things here, nothing.
26:35
[laughs]
26:35
Nothing.
26:37
As a matter of fact
26:40
I didn’t think too much of OSU at the time because, uh,
26:47
I got a letter in the mail asking me to put my name in for an
26:51
endowed professorship at Temple university back in Pennsylvania.
26:56
And so I decided to do that.
27:03
And in the meantime around the same time my friend Bob Becker,
27:10
I don’t know if you know names, Dr. Robert Becker, biochemistry.
27:14
Came up to me and said, Dick you know you’re the lowest
27:19
paid professor on the campus.
27:23
And I says, no that can’t be true.
27:26
He says yes, in those days they published the salaries in a volume
27:31
in the library so you could go look.
27:33
I never bothered but he did and so I decided to look at this other
27:39
job but I needed a few letters of recommendation so I went to Dean Young
27:44
who was dean of research at the time.
27:46
And I had worked with him before because they were just starting
27:51
research committees and I was one of the original members.
27:56
And I went up to him asked him for a recommendation and he got mad at me.
28:02
He says what do you want a letter of recommendation for.
28:11
I said I want to apply for a job.
28:12
He says , I said the university doesn’t treat me very well.
28:14
He said oh that’s not true.
28:16
So he had his secretary check my salary.
28:20
And he went to the higher board to get my salary changed but
28:24
they won’t do anything about it.
28:26
It took him two years and he finally got it adjusted.
28:30
That was the first time that happened.
28:32
It happened a second time too.
28:34
I was going back to the national Science foundation as a program director.
28:42
And what our salary was in Washington was based on our salary back home.
28:48
And our dean of science at the time was Dean Carls who moved back there
28:55
and knew what it was all about.
28:58
He looked at my salary and looked at the uh position and he says no
29:06
your salary is too low you can’t live back there on that salary.
29:11
So he uh
29:15
he finally got my salary changed so that I could live back there decently.
29:21
Not luxuriously but at least decently.
29:24
At that time there were no funds available so John Verner helped.
29:32
Cause I was working oceanography and I was the fourteenth professor of oceanography
29:37
there and he supplied fifteen percent of my salary and that brought me up.
29:47
But uh oceanography was started with uh, Burt, Wayne Burt.
29:55
And Wayne Burt uh and I knew each other when we were both at Scripps.
30:03
So that’s why I, the reason I came to OSU
30:09
position.
30:10
But they didn’t offer any pay with it.
30:14
But at the same time that happened I,
30:18
[battery died; started again:]
30:22
oh I got all
30:28
kinds of em.
30:30
Then I went to Alaska, off this coast, anywhere I could get to.
30:33
Anyway, he told me I believe it.
30:39
Give me the manuscript.
30:41
This was Limnology and Oceanography?
30:44
yes.
30:44
And so he published the paper.
30:45
It never went out to the review.
30:47
Too many reviewers at limnology and oceanography.
30:52
That’s how it got published.
30:53
Oh wow.
30:55
But stokes
30:58
still would not believe it.
31:00
He sent one of his students
31:05
here to see for himself.
31:07
He wouldn’t come at all.
31:09
And he went back and told him it was true.
31:13
And then the last bit of being professor I had was the same
31:17
person, he wanted to come here
31:20
And see them for himself, huh?
31:22
Well, he wanted to work on some of em so he came.
31:28
And then they believed you?
31:29
Well he believed me, but stokes, I don’t think he ever let up.
31:35
But
31:38
now he’s passed away a long time ago.
31:42
He was one generation ahead of me.
31:46
[pause]
31:49
So, uh, we got the recorder to work.
31:53
We’re just uh, we’ll just be very careful that it doesn’t go out again,
31:58
and apologies for uh, the repletion.
32:01
Um,
32:06
I think
32:09
where we left off was sort-of you were starting to talk about you came to Oregon
32:15
State and um your uh in 1962, right?
32:35
OK.
32:36
And I think we were
32:37
63
32:37
63? Oh, OK.
32:37
And um, we were discussing your, uh, just what your research
32:41
was and those kinds of things.
32:43
Well uh, that’s how I got started with sacrophiles.
32:47
And uh, but I did the work, I realized the relation that no one
32:59
kept their samples cold.
33:01
And in a bottle about that size I put some yeast extract and filled it with
33:08
water and then uh sterilized it and had a technician out in the ? boat,
33:18
which was very small at that time.
33:21
What boat was that?
33:23
OSU boat.
33:23
The one that first uh,
33:29
the first one that OSU had, I think it was called the Aquitta.
33:33
And the Aquitta went from OSU to Alaska.
33:41
Because although OSU ran it, the boat actually belonged to
33:47
the National Science Foundation.
33:50
And then OSU got another boat.
33:53
I don’t know what the one is called now.
33:59
Anyway, I isolated the sacrophiles, and three of my students, Sherrill
34:05
Burton, Roger Hang, and Paul Mathimeyer wanted to change their
34:11
problems, but they were on research grants so I said no, so that’s how
34:22
it got started.
34:22
And you were telling us about um how you had a tech on a boat um get a sample?
34:33
yah, and
34:38
they I went down with an ice chest and
34:42
And you drove back to Corvallis?
34:44
then all the Petri dishes I used for isolation were already pre
34:49
incubated in the refrigerator.
34:51
I did not let them get above room temperature.
34:54
Then I started to isolate them.
34:58
I isolated so many that it was really pathetic
35:04
[laughter].
35:04
And then also I uh, oh,
35:10
that’s an interesting story [pointed at hat], oh
35:14
Trojan explosives?
35:17
You know what Trojan Explosives is?
35:19
No
35:20
It was the second largest producer of
35:24
explosives in the US and located at Spanish worth, Utah.
35:31
And they were having troubles because they manufactured all
35:34
their explosives in uh Colorado.
35:40
They asked me what they could do because explosive materials were in
35:44
the soil and they had to get rid of it.
35:47
They didn't know how to do it, so they called me in and I said, "Oh,
35:52
yeah, that will be easy." [laughter] And so I went back there and
36:01
I bought some energy sources from anywhere and sprinkled it
36:08
all around and the microbes had
36:15
to... so it just pulled them back into the explosives.
36:17
They are
36:22
amazing little things.
36:23
Oh, wow!
36:24
So that's how my...
36:25
Bioremediation
36:27
That's how I got the cap.
36:30
They said, "Well, you deserve a cap," and
36:36
gave it to
36:38
me.
36:39
[Laughter]
36:39
Well that bioremediation went off very well.
36:42
They were all surprised.
36:42
I said, "Well, you know..."
36:46
They sent me a check for $1,500.
36:47
Oh, wow!
36:50
Um, so your work with microbes has done some fairly interesting stuff.
36:57
I
37:00
mean, bioremediation... oil spills?
37:02
Were you involved in any...
37:03
Oh, yeah, we did it back in Alaska.
37:05
We got
37:08
to work with cycopods but we were working with oil spills too.
37:12
So we had a grant to take care of Alaska all the way from Point
37:17
Barrow to all the way around.
37:19
And we did that for... wow...
37:24
six years.
37:28
But, uh, we addressed soil, or oil, rather.
37:33
[36:48]
37:34
Did you find a bacteria that...
37:37
Oh, they were there
37:43
the whole time.
37:43
They were there?
37:43
They're everywhere.
37:43
You can't get rid of them.
37:43
Right... but I guess I mean, were there other people using that technology
37:48
already or were you developing the bioremediation of oil technology?
37:54
Oh, people had done that on soil so that technology was already there.
37:59
We just applied it to water.
38:02
Right, okay.... Aright, then... that's
38:06
great.
38:09
Um... so I think part of what we missed was you talking about your,
38:14
um... the unstructured part of Scripps and your... how you brought that sort
38:22
of unstructured... you know, self directive approach to Oregon State.
38:31
When you were... as a professor... as a major professor.
38:35
Well,
38:38
the reason I had students go for their Masters is because I wanted
38:42
to see how they thought in terms of research ideas and so forth.
38:52
If I wasn't satisfied then I didn't take them as a full professor... or, I mean,
39:01
PhD. And the funniest thing is while I was here I had a visit
39:07
from a student in Sealine...
39:10
Oh, wow.
39:11
And they wanted me to come back down there to take care of their research.
39:16
And I said, "No, I'm not interested." And that's how one of my students by
39:21
the name of Gillespie went down there.
39:23
And he went down there and I said, "One thing you make sure when you get down
39:29
there, to demand a sibilation counter... you know, to count radioactivity so
39:36
they can view things radioactively.
39:37
And that's what they did.
39:39
He liked it so much down there that he became a citizen.
39:44
Oh, wow.
39:45
[39:59]
39:45
And...
39:48
I could tell you
39:51
where all my PhDs all ended up.
39:53
The one I put in starting at Nebraska went back to
40:04
a chair in the Caribbean.
40:06
Then there was one by the name Hill.
40:12
He came back as a botanist to get his PhD underway, and his research.
40:20
And he went up to McAlester College.
40:23
And then, the last woman who finished up here was Cho Burton who went to
40:28
Nebraska and did some very good work.
40:33
And, being as she was a Mormon, BYU called her back, so she taught at BYU.
40:40
The second one was one that I brought from Nebraska by the name of Rodger Tate.
40:51
After he got done with his PhD he didn't do too much, which I was very surprised
40:57
when he ended up at San Jose State.
41:03
And let me go down the list.
41:05
I had... oh...
41:11
Mary Albright from Canada,
41:15
and Penny Eany from Portland State, who is now a dean at the
41:20
University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
41:25
I had Gill Geasy, who was professor at the Montana State.
41:37
Larry Jones came to me from Iowa.
41:40
He ended up
41:44
at El Paso... the University of Texas at El Paso.
41:49
Paul is up at LSU.
41:50
Navitsky ended up at...
41:56
in Georgia.
41:56
Steve Hardesty ended up
42:06
at Clemson University.
42:10
And I had a very brilliant student who was here by the name of Ron Junes,
42:18
and he ended up at Florida State... or Florida International, rather.
42:26
Couldn't stand it there, so when he got a job at Portland State,
42:31
unfortunately he went blind.
42:34
He was one of the most brilliant students I had ever seen.
42:39
But, that does it, I think, in terms of students.
42:43
Did you... did you remain close with your students.
42:47
Did you keep in touch?
42:49
Well, some of them stayed in touch, but most of them, no.
42:55
They got too busy in their own work.
42:57
Yeah...
42:59
I can't blame them.
43:01
Yeah... Let's see, I think another thing that we missed is... that I thought was
43:06
interesting, but it was not necessarily a good thing, but it was interesting was
43:10
just that how you found out that you were the lowest paid member of the team, and
43:17
I was wondering, if you wouldn't mind going back over for the tape, how you
43:22
discovered that and then what happened...
43:24
Oh, I didn't discover it.
43:25
Yeah... how somebody else discovered it... yeah.
43:28
They, in those early years... they published those salaries and
43:33
put them in the library, here.
43:35
And he went over to look at it, and that's how I found out that I was
43:40
the lowest paid professor on campus.
43:42
I came here as an associate prof and in two years I made professor.
43:49
The chair didn't want to make me a full professor immediately.
43:55
I
43:58
had only served as an assistant professor for three years at the
44:05
University of Houston, which I despised.
44:07
[Laughter]
44:07
Why did you despise it there?
44:10
[44:26]
44:12
I taught all the various course in microbiology and I found out many years
44:17
later I was the lowest paid professor in the department, and I had post-doc work.
44:23
The eldest assistant professor had no post doc work and was paid much more than
44:28
I. In the fall that I had taught human microbiology, he taught no courses except
44:36
for one, and the chairman let him go to school to get his PhD. He got his PhD
44:43
while I was there, and so she was going to promote him before I was promoted.
44:49
And so I said, "Nothing doing," and so I left.
44:52
And it was a twelve-person department, and out of the twelve,
45:00
nine of us left at the same time.
45:03
And having no place to go to, I chose to work in the Antarctic
45:10
or going back to Nebraska.
45:11
And my old chair had hired me without interview or anything,
45:17
and his colleagues were quite put out with him because he hired me.
45:24
But, then... they got over it after a while.
45:28
And the only reason that I left Nebraska was I was going to be
45:32
promoted ahead of my colleagues, and
45:39
I was most junior in terms of rank.
45:43
So as soon as I got to Nebraska, I went in and stood up and voiced the papers.
45:51
They looked at my publication and they said, "You should be an associate
45:56
professor by now." And so in only a year I became an associate professor.
46:05
And I was the last to be promoted ahead, and then to be a professor
46:07
very shortly, after being
46:12
in rank only two years.
46:15
Then, my position here came about.
46:19
The reason it came about is when I was at the University of Houston, the position
46:26
for a physiologist opened up, and the professor that got it was Lela Parks.
46:32
But I was not a physiologist, but they realized I taught the
46:35
course, and Paul Whitaker saw it.
46:40
And the next trip he made to Texas, he asked me to meet
46:45
him at the Dallas airport.
46:47
I went from Houston to Dallas and he went over and back down there
46:54
and he gave them a number, and he said to me, "As soon as I find the funds, you'll
46:58
be out on the faculty." I forgot about it
47:04
and, by God, a couple years later he came down and he came to Nebraska and he said
47:10
he had the funds for me to come to OSU.
47:14
So that's how I finally ended up here.
47:18
And
47:21
did you immediately feel... uh... welcomed?
47:24
Or did it take a while to adjust to the research and life at Oregon State?
47:31
No, it didn't take me long, because I had all night callings.
47:37
Lela Parks went over to Gilmore.
47:43
Gilmore made sure that I would have a salary after the
47:47
grants ran out for paying me.
47:51
And...
47:56
there was a microbial geneticist from Massachusetts,
48:05
Kriptorn, who I got along with very well, and
48:11
Bill Sandine was here.
48:23
Well, there's one more... I can't remember his name.
48:29
He was in the office next to me.
48:31
He had to be a medical microbiologist,
48:37
and...
48:40
Henderson was a younger fellow.
48:41
He was a microbiologist.
48:46
Those were the people.
48:49
Then we hired quite a few after that.
48:54
HB.
48:54
And, so, it sounds like your department was expanding when you got... you were
49:00
involved in getting Nash Hall built?
49:02
Yeah.
49:03
Okay.
49:05
Maybe you'll tell us again how... uh... why Nash Hall was built?
49:11
[48:27]
49:12
Well, we knew we needed a new building because we couldn't
49:15
put any equipment up there.
49:17
And, so Paul and I went back to Washington trying to find money.
49:25
And we looked around... the National Science Foundation didn't have any
49:31
money, but we came out for an interview and the person that was the academician
49:38
on that site was Chad Rittenberg that I knew when I was going out for my
49:45
masters degree, and the second interview was with the Office of Education...
49:51
no, I'll take that back, it was the National Institute of Health, and the
49:57
interview was with a Star, Mortimer Star,
50:04
and he filled right in quite well.
50:07
And the third was with the Office of Education, and that person was McVicor.
50:08
He was the one to interview.
50:09
And the Office of Education had the money but president
50:09
Johnson cut it off in all of that
50:20
money
50:24
flaw.
50:25
The first one that had the priority, and two tied for number two, and
50:31
that's how Nash Hall got built.
50:33
And it was built by the architect that they used... the Japanese were
50:42
making so it was earthquake-proof.
50:45
And that's why it would shake, so that it would give instead of break.
50:52
That's how Nash Hall was built.
50:54
But they changed it all.
50:55
They spent a lot of money trying to get it to the American way of
51:00
having a building, so Nash Hall
51:08
is now earthquake proof by American standards.
51:11
[Laughter]
51:12
But they didn't... they were... uh... they changed it because
51:16
the shaking was affecting the instrumentation, or the labs?
51:21
Um...
51:24
the entire building would shake a little.
51:27
Oh, okay.
51:28
It gives, you know?
51:30
Just like Jell-o, you know it kind of bounces back.
51:35
Yeah, and you can feel it...
51:35
Well, you could feel it... but that's how Nash Hall was built.
51:41
Nobody over there finished meeting with the architect to check it out.
51:46
Because when Nash hall was built, we had an architect out there designing
51:51
that building for about six months.
51:53
It was a young design.
51:57
We went to Portland and the architect was the one who completed
52:03
the design for this building.
52:08
And did you know that Oregon had a lot of earthquakes then?
52:13
Or I mean...
52:13
[Shakes head no]
52:14
No... okay.
52:17
Um... and then you were also involved in getting the Marine Science Center built.
52:25
No, Wane Burt.
52:26
[51:43]
52:26
But you and Wane Burt and...
52:30
...the other members were Bill Piercy and Doug
52:39
Kurl.
52:39
Wane is the one who was heaviest involved in writing
52:46
. And
52:50
so, what was supposed to be going on out at Hatfield?
52:53
What was the idea?
52:56
To have a marine station.
52:58
Okay.
53:03
Um...
53:08
A question I had... you'd mentioned that your wife also has a PhD, but she
53:13
ended up deciding to stay at home...
53:15
She's an immunologist.
53:17
An immunologist?
53:17
Wow!
53:18
I was going to say... how was your family involved in your career?
53:21
I know you have a couple of children.
53:23
Did they come on campus a lot or were they supportive at home?
53:28
They grew up at home.
53:30
When we moved all three kids were youngsters.
53:35
My
53:38
oldest daughter ended up with a PhD in history.
53:41
But she is partially blind so she could never find a job.
53:45
She lives at home.
53:47
My youngest daughter is the only one who doesn't have an advanced degree
53:52
but she ended up with an accountant and got married and lives in Heany Valley.
53:58
And my youngest is a boy who's an associate dean
54:04
in Portland.
54:06
Wow.
54:06
I was going to
54:11
say... um...
54:15
So, what do you feel like was your greatest contribution
54:18
to OSU during your time here?
54:24
That's a good question.
54:26
I don't know.
54:29
I guess my publication.
54:30
And
54:33
you were saying that you made your findings by... and correct
54:37
me if I'm wrong or elaborate on it, was the sacrophiles, right?
54:42
And the starvation sruvival, would you say those are your two greatest...
54:46
...with the extremophile... But the major professor
54:54
and I developed a thalloid.
54:54
Right.
54:55
[54:13]
54:56
But
55:00
I think I got most of my ideas
55:08
in the.... were the one hundred and... what...
55:14
thirty-some publications or something like that.
55:17
One hundred and thirty publications... wow!
55:20
But I think the most interesting one is the last review I put out
55:28
on hydrogen and its survival.
55:33
And I published one book.
55:39
I had a student that did his undergraduate at OSU that came
55:46
into my lab and did a little work.
55:50
And he contacted me
55:55
about a year ago.
55:56
He's up at the University of Michigan, faculty.
56:02
He picked up on my
56:07
starvation survival because he was in
56:12
the Netherlands and he went back to and old collection of
56:18
microbes and he isolated them.
56:20
They were not touched for over fifty years and he was kind of surprised
56:27
that I had written about such things.
56:32
I was also reading one of my post-doc from Spain.
56:39
There used to be a number of bacteriaphage, the little
56:43
virus... microbial viruses in the marine system and it floated.
56:48
So
56:50
that was a first
56:53
also.
56:54
That's really interesting... I
57:01
guess kind of another big over-arching question: what do you think your biggest
57:05
challenge was while you were at OSU?
57:09
What aspect of your career was the most challenging?
57:33
...I don't know
57:33
[Laughter]
57:33
...big question... yeah.
57:34
I guess... um...
57:37
you were here from '62 to... as a... and then you formally...
57:42
'63
57:43
...I'm sorry, '63.
57:44
And then you formally retired in
57:49
1987... '88.
57:50
Yeah, I ended in '88.
57:53
Well, I kept my office for seventeen years.
57:58
And so you had been at Oregon State for a while and... did
58:02
you see any changes in... um...
58:07
What kind of changes did you see in
58:12
the school itself, and also just in your department and in oceanography.
58:18
A lot of students.
58:19
I came and the student population was in
58:23
the five thousands.
58:24
Wow!
58:26
And so it grew four-fold.
58:28
It grew four-fold.
58:30
Wow!
58:33
I could remember having... teaching the beginning micro classes were small,
58:38
and then all of a sudden they got big.
58:41
Then after a while,
58:45
I was teaching microbiology and...
58:52
what's that auditorium where the
58:57
zoologists are located?
58:59
Um...
59:03
it's not the Gilfillan Auditorium, is it?
59:08
No...
59:08
[58:26]
59:09
It's across the way from Nash Hall.
59:13
It's behind the... it
59:21
was between the oceanography and Nash Hall.
59:24
Oh, Peavey?
59:27
No?
59:29
They
59:33
changed the buildings over there.
59:34
I'm not sure
59:35
There's an auditorium over there that holds about two hundred and fifty.
59:39
Okay.
59:40
And I used to lecture in there twice a day: once in the morning
59:45
and once in the afternoon.
59:48
So I had a total of five hundred students.
59:50
Wow!
59:52
Did you have a lot of TAs?
59:55
I didn't have to take care of the lab.
59:58
So I just taught the lecture and the TAs took care of the lab.
1:00:04
So you have seen a remarkable increase in the number of students.
1:00:09
When I first started teaching beginning micro, it was in an auditorium in the
1:00:15
engineering, it was in a small auditorium.
1:00:19
So that was easy enough.
1:00:21
But all of a sudden it blossomed
1:00:25
and got too big.
1:00:26
Yeah... Did you find any...
1:00:30
did you find there was more competition for grant money and
1:00:35
that... maybe your research got a little more difficult to carry out?
1:00:39
No, I was fortunate in that
1:00:45
I got grant money.
1:00:46
I got quite a bit.
1:00:48
I had 43 % of the grant money at one time in the department and I definitely had
1:00:55
more money than the department by far.
1:00:59
That was the whole department.
1:01:02
And that's what mad the department function easier, because there was
1:01:07
overhead on these grants so the chair could use the money on the department.
1:01:14
Even today, you will find departments that don't have enough money
1:01:18
to run the department as it is.
1:01:25
Microbiology was the exception.
1:01:33
So you saw the College of Oceanography grow, too.
1:01:37
Yeah
1:01:38
[60:55]
1:01:42
And you saw the buildings over there being built: Burt and...
1:01:47
It was first located in... Sheldon and then
1:01:52
it moved to Food Technology.
1:01:56
And
1:02:02
I think it moved back to Sheldon at the end.
1:02:06
They finally got the first part of the building built and the man that
1:02:11
was in charge of putting it up was
1:02:18
a Rick Picklewoods.
1:02:22
He wrote the grant and got funded.
1:02:29
The second part of the building, I don't know who wrote that up.
1:02:38
That's a lot of change...
1:02:46
And then the third part...
1:02:50
unfortunately I was one of the committee members that wrote that up [laughter].
1:02:55
Did you say "unfortunately"?
1:02:56
Yeah...
1:02:57
Was it a lot of work?
1:02:58
Oh... it took time.
1:03:00
Yeah...
1:03:02
That's a difficulty.
1:03:06
If you're in academia you have to realize it's not an
1:03:09
eight-hour day, definitely not.
1:03:12
Not if you want to get anywhere,
1:03:16
because the competition is not on an eight-hour day.
1:03:28
Um...
1:03:32
you mentioned that you had won a couple of awards for your work.
1:03:36
Is that correct?
1:03:37
...throughout your time as a researcher...
1:03:41
Not here at OSU.
1:03:44
No, really?
1:03:45
Okay...
1:03:46
I won what they call a...
1:03:52
oh...
1:03:58
the science in Canadian microbiology.
1:04:01
They gave an award for the marine work.
1:04:11
And I
1:04:14
was invited three times by the science region of microbiology of
1:04:19
England for quite a bit of my work.
1:04:24
I went to England quite of number of times by invitation.
1:04:31
I can't count the number of times I've been in England and Scotland lecturing.
1:04:38
Wow!
1:04:40
[63:57]
1:04:41
At the end of my career after I retired, I lectured in...
1:04:52
in
1:04:56
Norway, the Netherlands...
1:05:08
and
1:05:13
Spain twice and Portugal,
1:05:18
and
1:05:22
I made six trips to Peru... I mean, Chile lecturing.
1:05:28
After the war I went to Japan two or three times lecturing, which they
1:05:36
invited me and gave me an honorary... so it made it nice.
1:05:41
But
1:05:45
I only lectured in Mexico once.
1:05:52
That's a lot of traveling.
1:05:53
That's great.
1:05:54
And I lectured at all the major universities in Australia
1:06:01
Wow!
1:06:02
Oh, right I... didn't I read that you were a visiting professor down at
1:06:12
the...
1:06:12
I decided I had better take my sabbatical or I'd lose it.
1:06:16
But you know, when you take a sabbatical, if you go to [?] you could get full
1:06:24
pay while you are on sabbatical.
1:06:26
But if you go to [?] I think you have to put a third of your salary... so
1:06:34
you had to dig up the rest somewhere.
1:06:37
So, I had an idea that I would go to Israel, and I made arrangements
1:06:47
to go to Israel and I had a friend named Moshishilo, and he
1:06:53
was going to set it up for me
1:06:59
and handle it in Israel.
1:07:01
Then the Olympics came around and they had that terrible incident where one
1:07:06
of the Israeli athletes got killed...
1:07:12
Oh, in Munich...
1:07:13
Yeah... so my wife put her foot down and said, "No, we're not going there." So I
1:07:19
had to figure out how to get somewhere and I thought about going to Japan,
1:07:26
but I couldn't dig up enough funds.
1:07:28
So I thought, "Well, maybe I'll go to Australia." So I
1:07:35
asked my friend down there...
1:07:41
I can't remember his name...
1:07:46
Schoolman... he was a microbial taxonomist.
1:07:48
He told
1:07:52
me, "Well, why don't you come to Australia?" I says, "Fine, but I need
1:08:01
some means to support." He said, "Don't worry about that." And he
1:08:08
got me what they call the...
1:08:14
what was it... Queen Elizabeth II Senior Fellowship, given once every two years.
1:08:24
So I was the second one to receive it.
1:08:26
The first one only went down there for a month and came back.
1:08:29
That was Theodore Bullock who was a great physiologist, and I was the second.
1:08:36
That that's how I got to Australia.
1:08:41
My youngest daughter lived in Oxford...
1:08:45
[Laughter]
1:08:49
Did your family... how old were your children?
1:08:53
Oh, they were old enough.
1:08:55
My oldest was finished high school already.
1:08:58
Oh, okay.
1:09:02
And they came and visited?
1:09:04
No, I took the whole family.
1:09:05
[68:23]
1:09:05
Oh, you took the whole family...
1:09:09
So I lectured all the way out to...
1:09:14
oh... the western territory... what's the name of that school?
1:09:21
Anyway...
1:09:24
when I lectured there was hardly an audience because
1:09:27
the school wasn't very big.
1:09:29
Yeah... That's so great, the experience.
1:09:33
I would love to go to Australia,
1:09:42
that would be wonderful.
1:09:42
Australia is a strangled place.
1:09:44
In
1:09:52
your time here at OSU what was your relationship like with the other
1:09:58
professors and the administration?
1:10:00
Was it strictly professional or did you form a lot of friendships here?
1:10:06
Oh, I got along with quite a few profs, mainly Paul Liquor.
1:10:16
We were
1:10:20
also classmates.
1:10:22
And
1:10:26
there were a few others, but they're all disappeared.
1:10:45
I'd say, I mainly intermingled with my associates within the department.
1:10:53
And in Oceanography, Bill Pearcy mainly.
1:11:01
For a time, Herb Curl, but he left.
1:11:04
And, uh, I got along very well with Pieckowicz.
1:11:13
Oh, there’s another physical oceanographer that
1:11:17
was here, but left.
1:11:20
I can’t remember his name.
1:11:24
I’d have to go back and look.
1:11:26
[Laughter]
1:11:27
You remember a lot of names though.
1:11:29
With all your grad students, I would have forgotten.
1:11:34
Well,
1:11:40
my master’s students, most of them, I don’t know where they are.
1:11:46
The first one I got was from Penn State, Mary Weimer, but I terminated her
1:11:54
Master’s degree.
1:11:56
She wanted to go on, but I said no.
1:11:59
So, she went directly into Oceanography instead, and tried to get started there
1:12:08
and get her Ph.D., but didn’t make it.
1:12:11
But she was the first one.
1:12:19
As a matter of fact, when I taught at Houston,
1:12:25
I had two females there that took my class, and I met them in Australia.
1:12:31
Oh, funny.
1:12:32
And they were teaching there?
1:12:34
They were on the faculty at two different universities there.
1:12:38
Wow.
1:12:38
And then, when I first got to OSU a senior in
1:12:46
the department wanted to work in my lab.
1:12:48
I said, “OK, fine.” So I went to Australia and there she was! Down
1:12:54
at the University of New South Wales and that’s, I met her again.
1:13:05
It’s a small world, isn’t it?
1:13:06
Yeah.
1:13:08
I think one of the smallest things is, I did some work on
1:13:14
starvation-survival in microbes and two South Africans picked
1:13:21
up on and wrote a couple papers.
1:13:26
She wanted to see me, so she shipped up the cheapest way she could, and
1:13:32
she got on a plane and flew through Brazil, and flew up here, got on a
1:13:38
train and then came up to Corvallis.
1:13:41
So I had her stay at the house and I had one of my post-docs by the name of, uh
1:13:54
– isn’t it terrible, I can’t remember.
1:14:00
In Seattle, he took care of her for a few days.
1:14:05
Then she went across the country.
1:14:07
But that was unusual.
1:14:10
I used to have all kinds of visitors when I was at OSU.
1:14:14
I’m sorry I didn’t keep a log of them, but I used to have, I’d say, a
1:14:20
visitor at least once every two weeks.
1:14:25
A lot of them were from Japan and a lot of them were from Europe.
1:14:32
And stay at your house?
1:14:34
No, they would stop in after they found a motel or something.
1:14:39
That’s really great that you’d look after them.
1:14:48
And when
1:14:50
we did have money to bring in speakers, I was fortunate I was
1:14:55
able to get people from outside the U.S. to come in to give lectures.
1:15:03
And one of them was Dr. Professor Wilheim Schwarz.
1:15:11
What was his
1:15:13
– He was a marine microbiologist.
1:15:16
OK.
1:15:18
I’ll tell you a funny story about going over to Russia – I mean Germany.
1:15:25
I decided on my first trip to Europe – in those days research grants
1:15:32
had no money for going overseas.
1:15:36
And I had an invitation to speak at the Society of General
1:15:41
Microbiology of England in,
1:15:45
uh,
1:15:51
a town in Northern Scotland known as the Granite City – I
1:15:56
can’t remember the name of it.
1:15:59
And then I had an invitation to speak in
1:16:06
France – Poitier, France on pressure, because I was one
1:16:11
of the few people working on hydrostatic pressure on microbes.
1:16:16
I couldn’t find a way to get over there.
1:16:21
So, Wayne Burt
1:16:26
heard of it, heard me squawking about it.
1:16:29
Wayne arranged for me to fly military air transport from Portland to London,
1:16:40
from London back to the U.S.
1:16:44
And Paul Ehrlicher dug up $250 dollars, I don’t know from where, and gave it to me.
1:16:52
He said, “This is for transportation while you’re in Germany and France.” So I
1:16:58
flew from Portland to London, to France.
1:17:06
I got to France and I didn’t know what the hell to do.
1:17:13
I didn’t know how to get to Poitier, and
1:17:19
I was having my passport taken care of, and he stamped it, and I heard someone
1:17:28
else saying he was going to Poitier.
1:17:30
So we both got on the same train, and it went to Poitier.
1:17:36
I gave my lecture, and I went to eastern, no, the western part of
1:17:41
France and looked up a micrbiologist.
1:17:45
But he never told us that he was a physician and his
1:17:49
hobby was marine microbiology.
1:17:53
And then I went to Germany.
1:17:57
And when I went to Germany, I thought I’d better
1:18:05
look up a professor there, a young one, and I did.
1:18:09
And he said I want you to meet
1:18:13
my – in Germany there is only one professor per department.
1:18:18
He didn’t want to speak to me.
1:18:21
I guess I looked pretty young at the time, I had just became a full professor.
1:18:30
I went in and introduced myself, because the person that brought
1:18:34
me there didn’t dare go in.
1:18:36
And he couldn’t stand it, he had to ask me what position I held.
1:18:42
I said I am professor of microbiology and oceanography.
1:18:48
And he looked at me, and he changed his attitude.
1:18:52
For him it meant I was chairman of microbiology, chairman of oceanography.
1:18:57
Oh, both.
1:18:58
Both!
1:18:59
[Laughter]
1:19:01
And you were young!
1:19:04
And so I talked to him.
1:19:06
Well, many years later I found he finally went to one of the universities
1:19:12
in Arizona to give a couple lectures.
1:19:16
Anyway, he was really surprised that I made professor.
1:19:23
Oh,
1:19:26
that’s great.
1:19:29
One thing I was curious about is that you had mentioned that when you
1:19:32
were, back when you first applying to college, and you tried to go to Bowling
1:19:37
Green and they wouldn’t let you go.
1:19:40
These townspeople.
1:19:41
The townspeople.
1:19:42
And that was right after there were these internment camps, there was a
1:19:47
lot of discrimination at that time.
1:19:48
Oh, yeah.
1:19:49
How have you seen that change, and when did you start seeing that change?
1:19:54
Do you think it has changed?
1:19:56
It has changed.
1:19:57
After World War Two.
1:19:58
After World War Two, so it was just during that time there was a lot of
1:20:00
– Yeah, especially in California, Oregon and Washington.
1:20:05
So when you were at OSU, was there any remnant of that,
1:20:07
or do you think it changed?
1:20:08
Oh yeah, there was.
1:20:10
But Paul Ehrlicher
1:20:14
was a screen for me.
1:20:16
He was a screen, but, uh, I could feel it.
1:20:22
Paul himself was a very fair man, he was a son of a minister.
1:20:28
Sounds
1:20:31
like he was a great help in a lot of ways.
1:20:40
Yeah, Paul was one of the reasons I stayed at OSU, for many reasons.
1:20:49
I did receive a lot of offers to be considered at, Deans at various
1:20:55
schools, but I didn’t want that.
1:21:00
Being at NSF
1:21:03
was something like opening the gates for it, invitations.
1:21:08
Yeah.
1:21:09
I
1:21:14
think we’ve covered a lot.
1:21:19
Is there anything that you think might be interesting to add that
1:21:25
we haven’t talked about today?
1:21:30
No, I can’t think of anything.
1:21:35
You’ve had a really remarkable life, Dr. Morita.
1:21:37
Yeah,
1:21:41
even including the incarceration.
1:21:43
Yeah, it’s an important piece of Oregon history, for sure,
1:21:50
and definitely national.
1:21:51
Well, I’ll say one thing.
1:21:56
My army uniform is in Seattle.
1:22:00
Oh, where is it?
1:22:01
It’s at the, what they call the Nisei Veteran’s Association.
1:22:03
Oh,
1:22:07
ok.
1:22:10
They were asking for donations of one kind or another, so I sent my uniform
1:22:17
up there and they put it on display.
1:22:19
But after World War Two was over, most of the GIs kept wearing their GI
1:22:25
pants because things were expensive, and they didn’t have a fund.
1:22:30
They kept wearing their GI jackets and so forth, whereas I didn’t want to see
1:22:38
it.
1:22:38
So I put mine in mothballs and put it in the attic and left it there.
1:22:44
It was in perfect shape.
1:22:48
You were saying that your regiment was
1:22:54
highly decorated?
1:22:55
Were you yourself…?
1:22:56
No,
1:22:59
I missed action.
1:23:00
Oh, ok.
1:23:01
Because I went in late.
1:23:04
But about two days before the ship hit Naples,
1:23:11
the
1:23:14
audio system of the ship announced that the war was over.
1:23:18
So from Naples
1:23:23
we went all the way up to the [undistinguishable] valley,
1:23:26
which was what it was called where a lot of people got killed.
1:23:28
We put on a demonstration of
1:23:35
actual combat for other troops, because we were highly trained.
1:23:41
Most GIs went through basic training, what they call 9 month basic training.
1:23:48
We had to go through basic training that was 18
1:23:51
months.
1:23:53
The reason for eighteen months is, we had to learn to use a .25 automatic
1:24:01
all the way up to an anti-tank gun.
1:24:04
We had to learn how to use each one, strip it, everything.
1:24:10
And one of the things that really got to me was bayonet practice.
1:24:16
Oh, it went on for a week.
1:24:19
Got so tired at the end of the day, I could hardly hold a rifle up.
1:24:23
Wow, yeah.
1:24:25
And, so, one
1:24:27
day, we were with the cadre, during bayonet practice.
1:24:33
So I asked the cadre, “Why so much?” And he says to me,
1:24:42
“The 442nd was the only outfit in Europe to use the bayonet charge.”
1:24:53
That close of range…?
1:24:54
Yeah.
1:24:57
I swore at that time, that if I ever had to go on a bayonet
1:25:02
charge, I’d pull the trigger first.
1:25:05
Right.
1:25:07
Provided no one was in front of me.
1:25:10
That is, another GI.
1:25:14
But it didn’t do any good anyway, as soon as I got overseas, and
1:25:20
the first time we assembled as a company – and I was in I company
1:25:28
– I
1:25:31
lined up with my fellow GIs, and the platoon sergeant looked at
1:25:38
me, he goes, “Oh you’re a pretty good-sized fella!” Because Hawaiian
1:25:45
Japanese-Americans are smaller than I. He says, “You look like a big
1:25:49
fella, here,” he gave me the BAR.
1:25:54
That’s heavy.
1:25:56
Nineteen pounds without the bipod, 200 rounds you carry on your belt.
1:26:03
You also have an ammunition carrier that’s with you all the time.
1:26:07
You also carry 200 rounds.
1:26:09
Wow.
1:26:13
But fortunately I never had to fire it.
1:26:17
I did fire it once.
1:26:19
In Italy, after the war was over.
1:26:24
We were guarding a German compound, and I was on the watchtower.
1:26:31
And one of the German prisoners-of-war was testing me out.
1:26:36
He’d go from the barrack towards the fence.
1:26:41
And I’d wave him behind.
1:26:43
He kept doing it, more than once, so I put a round in a rifle I borrowed,
1:26:49
because I was on guard duty, I tried to borrow a rifle from one of my colleagues.
1:26:54
Put a round in, and let it fly, purposely missing him.
1:26:59
He never came out again.
1:27:04
I have to say, that was something.
1:27:07
The favorite town I was in when I was in Italy was Florence.
1:27:13
It’s a beautiful town.
1:27:16
And, what I used to do, when
1:27:19
we got a weekend leave, we’d hitchhike to Florence, which is
1:27:24
about sixty miles from where we were.
1:27:28
And then stay, where, the Army
1:27:31
had camps where you could stay a night for the equivalent of 25 cents.
1:27:40
So I’d stay overnight.
1:27:41
Also, you could get meals there, for nothing.
1:27:46
And, the first time I ever had pizza.
1:27:50
It was about, like, that size.
1:27:54
[Motions with hands to make small circle] Not like we have now.
1:27:57
[Laughter] And I can remember going to the restaurant, at that
1:28:02
time I knew a girl by the name of Harriet Benson who was an elderly
1:28:08
Red Cross, I met in Cortina, Italy where I took a path.
1:28:15
And she happened to be in town, so we went to this restaurant and had pizza.
1:28:21
While we were eating pizza, they closed the restaurant on us because
1:28:25
there was a hunger strike outside.
1:28:28
The thing that really got me more than anything else, when – at
1:28:35
least you get fed on post
1:28:42
– we’d get canned corn.
1:28:47
Sometimes, a female or two would come by the post and sit.
1:28:55
And relax.
1:28:56
And when we got fed, we’d offer them some of our meal because
1:29:02
we knew they were hungry, and they would never touch the corn.
1:29:06
So I finally asked them, “Why don’t you eat the corn?” They said, “Pig’s food.”
1:29:13
That was it, pig’s food.
1:29:15
They wouldn’t touch it.
1:29:18
Even though they were hungry…?
1:29:18
Even though they were hungry.
1:29:19
Did you
1:29:23
ever go back to…?
1:29:26
Italy?
1:29:26
Italy, yeah.
1:29:28
Only at the airport.
1:29:29
Oh, ok.
1:29:31
I… I don’t ever care to go back.
1:29:36
Yeah.
1:29:38
I went to Israel for a lake… uh, a warm lakes conference.
1:29:47
While I was in Israel, I had to do something else.
1:29:51
What the heck was it?
1:29:52
Anyway, on
1:29:57
the way back from, from, uh,
1:30:03
Israel, the plane stopped at
1:30:07
Rome.
1:30:09
Came back.
1:30:10
I never got to see Italy except for Cortina,
1:30:15
and uh,
1:30:19
Pisa, and Florence.
1:30:23
My brother was lucky.
1:30:25
Right after the war, he was traveling from, all the way from
1:30:30
Naples all the way to Austria.
1:30:35
They were carrying food supply.
1:30:39
And, uh, as a result he was able to go to Naples, and go to the Island
1:30:48
of Capri, and see Rome and everywhere else on his trips back and forth.
1:30:56
And here I was, stuck with guard duty, I didn’t get to go anywhere.
1:31:01
But I do know, he said when he was in Austria, the civilians in
1:31:07
Austria did not want to talk to him, they were scared, because they
1:31:14
thought they were Mongolian troops.
1:31:16
Oh…
1:31:18
So, he never
1:31:24
talked to any of them.
1:31:25
Do you still keep in touch with people from when you were in the service?
1:31:29
Most of them are dead, as much as I hate saying so.
1:31:33
I had a good friend that I, you know, went to basic training with,
1:31:42
and shared a shelter-half with when we were out in the field, sleeping.
1:31:49
Because when I was in Italy, we slept a lot in the field.
1:31:52
We finally got bunks.
1:31:55
And the first time we had a place to stay, it was an old warehouse,
1:32:02
and we slept on the floor.
1:32:06
Then they gave us cots.
1:32:10
Then we moved to, of all places, an old cow barn that had been swept out.
1:32:17
We lived in that for about four months.
1:32:22
Then we got moved out of Florence to, uh,
1:32:27
to Marina di Pisa.
1:32:29
Went to Tower of Pisa, I didn’t think it was that spectacular.
1:32:32
[Laughter] But
1:32:38
anyway, life in
1:32:43
Italy was, I would say, very boring.
1:32:47
Guard duty, guard duty, guard duty.
1:32:49
And right after the war, they started putting out these small pocket novels.
1:32:58
What I used to do was, I’d grab as many as I could, and hang on to them, and when I
1:33:05
went on guard duty, I used to read them.
1:33:09
[Laughter] Passed them off, tried to exchange them for other…
1:33:14
but I didn’t a lot of reading.
1:33:17
When I got out of the service,
1:33:21
I remember we finally came into New York, we got on a train and went cross-country.
1:33:32
And,
1:33:34
we went from
1:33:40
Patrick Henry in New Jersey, all the way to Marysvill, to camp,
1:33:48
oh, I forgot the name of it, there’s an Air Force base there.
1:33:55
And,
1:33:58
the cooks would not come out of their cooking unit.
1:34:04
They were scared because they had to face troops that were coming
1:34:07
back from overseas, and all they had to feed them was Spam!
1:34:12
And as of today, I still won’t eat Spam!
1:34:17
So they never came out of their cooking quarters.
1:34:21
So, when we hit the various cities, there’d be various
1:34:25
vendors selling sandwiches and so.
1:34:28
Big cities, when we had enough time, we’d run into town – like Denver, we ran
1:34:33
into town and got what we wanted to eat.
1:34:35
Did the same thing in Utah, all the way across the country.
1:34:41
When we got there to be discharged,
1:34:46
I wanted to get out so I could get to school, because
1:34:48
school had already started.
1:34:50
And, so, I went up to the front of the line and explained my
1:34:53
situation, so I got to the front of the line, in front of everybody.
1:34:57
So I got out of the service
1:35:01
about three weeks before my brother did, because he had to
1:35:04
stay there and wait in line.
1:35:07
So, I got my discharge papers, and 300 dollars for being discharged.
1:35:18
And
1:35:22
I took the bus all the way from Marysville to L.A. and they used to
1:35:33
have the, what they called the big red car, from there, L.A. to Pasadena.
1:35:39
It was just a trolley.
1:35:43
And then I stayed home for three days, then I went back to school.
1:35:47
I flew back.
1:35:51
I was fortunate in that my major professor yanked all the cards
1:35:57
for me, I was five weeks late.
1:36:02
Next week, the following week was six weeks.
1:36:07
Triad exam.
1:36:11
I must have flunked them
1:36:15
all!
1:36:15
[Laughter]
1:36:15
It didn’t count!
1:36:17
They let you get away with it?
1:36:18
Yeah, but then, at that time, since I had not spent Christmas home, I decided to
1:36:29
go home and spend Christmas.
1:36:32
So, there was a, uh, another Japanese fellow by the name of Mohashimoto.
1:36:39
Fortunately he was a [inaudible] so he had bought a car, and a fellow by the
1:36:47
name of Knighteye, who ended up being a captain in the U.S. Army, and I, we drove
1:36:56
from Lincoln all the way to Pasadena.
1:37:01
Straight, without stopping.
1:37:04
Because, two of us would be up, one would be sleeping in the back.
1:37:09
That’s how I got home.
1:37:13
Great
1:37:40
stories.
1:37:41
You’ve given
1:37:45
us a lot to work with.
1:37:47
This is really remarkable.
1:37:49
You’ve lived a remarkable life, and…
1:37:54
Well, at least different.
1:37:56
Yeah, a lot of different phases.
1:37:59
A lot of different achievements.
1:38:02
Well, Mishimoto, a fellow GI I bunked with, he passed away quite a few
1:38:10
years ago, but he was from Ontario,
1:38:15
and
1:38:18
I get a journal that deals with all the various companies in the
1:38:27
442nd, and just last year, the end of last year, one of my friends
1:38:37
from the same platoon passed away in
1:38:43
Seattle.
1:38:45
And every time I get this newsletter, there’s about five
1:38:51
or six that are no longer around.
1:38:57
I will say something, their passing went pretty quickly though.
1:39:04
Because I’ll be 87 next month.
1:39:07
I
1:39:13
outlasted my brother by, what, 16 years now?
1:39:24
Eighty-seven years in this century, in this country, it’s seen a lot of different
1:39:29
changes, got to witness a big range
1:39:38
of events.
1:39:38
I will say one thing, growing up in Pasadena, the discrimination was
1:39:45
very subtle but it was still there.
1:39:48
But the main thing I remember about discrimination in the early days,
1:39:52
we were only allowed to go to the public swimming pool one day a week.
1:40:01
A special day?
1:40:04
Then the next day they changed the water.
1:40:06
Oh my gosh.
1:40:07
Really?
1:40:08
Really!
1:40:08
Yes!
1:40:09
Wow.
1:40:11
This was the Brookside Park.
1:40:14
Brookside Park is where the Rose Bowl is.
1:40:17
Oh, ok.
1:40:19
You know, I played in the Rose Bowl.
1:40:21
You played in the Rose Bowl?
1:40:24
Yeah.
1:40:25
How funny.
1:40:27
What year?
1:40:29
That’s a different matter!
1:40:31
[Laughter] When we were young we lived close enough to the
1:40:36
Rose Bowl to walk down there.
1:40:38
So, actually play in it, as a kid, you played in
1:40:43
it!
1:40:44
[Laughter]
1:40:44
Into the playing field, and start playing ball.
1:40:47
Then the caretaker would come out and kick us out.
1:40:52
But I played in
1:40:56
the Rose Bowl!
1:40:57
On that note,
1:41:00
do you root for USC, or do you root for the Beavers?
1:41:05
Oh, when they play?
1:41:06
I don’t root for USC anymore than I do for the Beavers.
1:41:13
I just watch the game.
1:41:16
I don’t follow football, I used to.
1:41:19
But then, I got tired of it.
1:41:26
Because I played football in junior high school and high school,
1:41:31
but I always had to play on the B-team, because I was too light.
1:41:34
I was the lightest man on the B-team, at 116 pounds, and I played right tackle.
1:41:38
The reason I was able to do that, I was pretty strong at my age.
1:41:38
At age sixteen, seventeen, I could carry 300 pounds.
1:41:39
Wow.
1:41:40
That’s how I was able to handle right tackle.
1:41:42
And
1:41:51
a BAR.
1:41:54
Yeah.
1:41:54
A BAR is
1:42:10
something I’m glad I never had to fire.
1:42:13
Oh,
1:42:16
I fired BARs.
1:42:17
Matter of fact, I knew how to strip a BAR before I went into the service.
1:42:25
The reason is,
1:42:28
at the University of Nebraska, the first two years, if you
1:42:33
were male, you had to take ROTC.
1:42:38
And I was in ROTC for two years, and learned to strip
1:42:44
the M1, as well as the BAR.
1:42:50
So, I got overseas, duck soup, so to speak, to keep the thing clean.
1:42:57
I can remember once, the war was over, people said the heck with
1:43:03
their rifles, pistols, so forth.
1:43:09
And one day,
1:43:13
an inspection came, of all the weapons.
1:43:16
The guys had nothing else to do, they were checking all the units.
1:43:22
But we were the last unit in Italy that was for combat.
1:43:28
And I was the only person that had their weapon in tip-top shape, in terms
1:43:32
of having it clean and everything.
1:43:32
That was an unusual incident.
1:43:32
Well, we’re all very grateful that you came here.
1:43:32
Is there anything you’d like to add…?
1:43:32
You were wondering about why the archivist chose you.
1:43:33
Do you have any ideas?
1:43:33
No, all I can think of is must be the space that I
1:43:33
occupy in the whatchamacallit.
1:43:33
You could ask him for me.
1:43:33
[Laughter]
1:43:33
Well we will, and we’ll pass it along.
1:43:33
We definitely will.
1:43:33
You’ll have a chance to review the transcript when we put it together.
1:43:33
If there’s anything you’d like to add, I think we’re gonna get ready.
1:43:33
Thank you very much.
1:43:33
Well, you’re welcome.
1:43:33
Thank you for sharing your life with us.
1:43:33
It’s been a pleasure.
1:43:33
It’s been a pleasure to listen.
1:43:33
We’re really sorry about the whole tape incident.
1:43:33
That’s ok.
1:43:33
I think we got a fair amount though.
1:43:33
Alright.
1:43:33
What are you doing for Valentine’s Day weekend?
1:43:33
Same as usual: sleep.
1:43:33
[Laughter]
1:43:33
That’s a precious commodity in my life these days.
1:43:33
Let me say, the older you get, the more you need.
1:43:33
It’s like going back to the crib days.
1:43:33
The crib days of naps?
1:43:33
I’d love to take naps.
1:43:33
Katie, you’re gonna…
1:43:33
[Inaudible]
1:43:33
Dr. Morita, it’s been a pleasure.
1:43:33
Same here.
1:43:33
Thank you.
1:43:33
Nice to meet you.
1:43:33
Good to finally meet you.
1:43:33
I’ll see you guys later.
1:43:33
We’ll be in touch.
