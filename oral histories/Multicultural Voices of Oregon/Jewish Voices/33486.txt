00:00
This is June the 9th, 1992.
00:02
The interviewee is Miriam Orzech.
00:02
The interviewer is Judith Berlowitz.
00:02
So you came here
00:02
… 1957,
00:05
which was Ze'ev's first job -- first and only job, as it turned out, in academia.
00:11
And I was very highly pregnant with our first child, and had been teaching
00:20
prior to that, so when we came here and I had the baby and Ze'ev started his job
00:26
-- Was that your first child?
00:28
Un huh.
00:28
Sarah.
00:35
We spent a lot of time trying to get established.
00:38
Because although we really didn't think we were going to stay here forever,
00:45
we weren't making any active efforts to go anyplace else.
00:48
Could I interrupt you for just a minute, because you took off before I asked, and
00:53
I would like to have a thumbnail sketch of your life, and that of your husband
00:58
also, before you moved to Corvallis.
01:00
Where did you come from, where were you born, how did you meet?
01:04
So we just have a little sketch about who you were and are.
01:08
All right I can do that very quickly.
01:11
I was born in New York, and during the Second World War, I was what was called
01:17
popularly an Army brat -- my father was in the Army, and we moved around some.
01:22
And they, my parents, discovered that there was a world outside of
01:26
New York city, and decided that they would like to live in it.
01:30
And so he arranged to be discharged out in Washington State, at Ft. Lewis,
01:35
and they ultimately settled right here outside of Portland, in Lake Oswego.
01:41
So I finished high school there and I went to Reed College, and I
01:47
wound up at Berkeley, UC Berkeley, where I met my ever-lovin', Ze'ev.
01:54
And we married there.
01:55
He was a graduate student, I was an undergraduate student.
01:58
We married there, I finished in the fifth year, which was
02:02
their system, in education.
02:04
And we then moved to Pittsburg, California, which is in the Bay Area,
02:10
outside of Berkeley in the East Bay there.
02:14
Where we lived for three years while I taught in the high school there.
02:18
And then I became pregnant, and he decided it was time to look for a
02:24
job, and we decided we would try to find something up in the Portland
02:29
area so we could be near my parents.
02:32
Ze'ev's parents -- Ze'ev was of course born in Germany -- when he couldn't
02:38
go to school there any longer during the Hitler period, he was sent by his
02:41
parents to a Jewish boarding school in the French-speaking part of Switzerland,
02:48
which was where he learned to speak French -- it was either that or starve
02:52
-- and he stayed there for two years, and then the family fortunately got a
02:57
capitalist visa to Palestine, because the British were only letting in rich
03:04
Jews, or at least self-supporting Jews.
03:08
So he went to Palestine, at the time, went through high school there, in
03:12
Tel Aviv, and worked for a while, and then came to the United States to go
03:18
to higher education in 1947, which was before the establishment of the state.
03:24
So he's a true Palestinian with a British Mandate passport that says
03:28
Palestinian and the whole works.
03:30
Anyway, he started there at City College and then transferred to UC Berkeley,
03:34
which is where I met him when I came down, because there were mutual friends.
03:39
It was not love at first sight, it was hate at first sight, but
03:43
ultimately we got over that and got together and got married.
03:47
So that was in '52 and we came here in '57.
03:50
That brings us back to the point where I interrupted you, I think.
03:56
How would you describe your Jewish background and also that of Ze'ev?
04:01
Well Ze'ev grew up in a
04:07
moderately observant home, I guess.
04:12
His grandparents, from Warsaw, Poland, the whole family, a huge family, was
04:19
destroyed in the Holocaust except for a handful -- was ultra-religious.
04:26
And that's one reason Ze'ev's father left that whole establishment, because
04:31
he was very much under the thumb of Ze'ev's grandfather, and he struck
04:35
out on his own and went to Germany, which is where he met his wife, they
04:39
were married and Ze'ev was born.
04:43
Ze'ev had a very good Jewish education, but didn't grow
04:49
up being terribly religious.
04:53
I, on the other hand, grew up in a reform family, and went to Sunday
04:59
school from the year one and learned absolutely nothing, and my education
05:05
really, my Jewish education, began, really, with my marrying Ze'ev.
05:11
I was always Jewishly identified, and active.
05:15
At Reed College I was in a small Jewish students' group, because it
05:19
wasn't fashionable to be interested in religion at Reed College at that time.
05:27
And when the State of Israel was formed, I like everyone else
05:31
went out of my mind with joy.
05:35
And I've been accused of -- one of the reasons I married Ze'ev was that
05:40
I thought he'd be my ticket to Israel.
05:43
As it turned out I was his ticket back to Israel.
05:46
Any, his family stayed in Israel, his mother died shortly after we were
05:52
married, several years after we were married, and his father was utterly
06:00
despondent and left Israel at that time, and went back to their home community
06:05
in Wiesbaden, Germany, which shocked us to the roots, and we never could pry
06:12
him out of there, although he came for short periods to visit, but he was always
06:17
out of his element wherever he was.
06:20
Story of the Jew.
06:23
Anyway, so Ze'ev
06:27
became an American, and he's lived here most of his life, as it turns out.
06:31
So how would you describe the Jewish community when you came?
06:39
Let me back up just a little bit about our identification.
06:42
Because I had taught Sunday school when I was still in Portland,
06:48
in high school and in college.
06:50
Ze'ev it turns out had taught Sunday School always in the San Francisco area.
06:56
Partly it was a way to make money, because although he had money when he came here,
07:03
when the wars started it was very difficult to send money from Israel,
07:08
so he was pretty much self-supported.
07:11
When we moved to Pittsburgh, California, it was a little town
07:14
like Corvallis, in a sense, but
07:18
we were the new young, relatively newly married young couple, and so we
07:23
were kind of adopted immediately by the Jewish community which was there.
07:27
And they were in the throes of trying to start something, starting
07:31
a Sunday school, starting a community and all the rest of that.
07:34
So we immediately got sucked in for that.
07:36
We were teaching Sunday school and Ze'ev was conducting
07:38
services and all the rest of it.
07:40
So our married life started out immediately with us being involved,
07:46
which was fine with us, we both would have thought that anyway.
07:50
So when we came here, immediately, we sought out whatever Jews there were.
07:55
And I don't remember how we
07:59
--- I don't know, I think Jews kind of gravitate to each other.
08:01
I don't remember how we met the first people.
08:04
It was probably the Schecters and Fisiks, because they came
08:08
here a year or two before us.
08:12
Anyway we were almost immediately caught up in the gastronomic meetings that I'm
08:20
sure you've heard about from other people.
08:22
And I remember vividly going to Ruth and Ben Goldberg's house, and
08:28
being very warmly greeted by them, and of course the Loneys the same
08:32
way, and Konicks the same way.
08:35
So
08:37
the previously resident Jews made it kind of a point to gather in the
08:43
people from the university for...
08:46
And how many people are we talking about?
08:47
Would you like to hazard a guess?
08:49
Well there were those three families that were the residents here.
08:52
The townspeople as it were.
08:53
Loney, Konick and Goldberg.
08:57
And
08:59
that's really all as far as I know.
09:02
And then there were the university people, and that's the others.
09:05
Schecters were here, Malamuds were here although he wasn't involved in the Jewish
09:10
community except the occasional latke,
09:14
the Levines -- Shep and Gloria Levine -- in the art department,
09:19
Ann Tonsen, philosophy, these people are not really involved
09:22
anymore and haven't been for years.
09:24
But the gastronomic connection was enough to keep them, and everybody
09:29
liked everyone else, and there was lots of good humor and laughter, and
09:35
all the rest.
09:35
So it was a social group?
09:36
It was entirely a social thing.
09:38
Were the Goheens here then?
09:41
I think so.
09:42
I think so.
09:46
And every time we got together for one of these things, we would kind of bemoan the
09:50
fact that that was all there was, because all of us had come from bigger cities or
09:56
other kinds of communities where there was an organization of some kind, and there
10:00
wasn't even a B'nai B'rith or anything.
10:03
Would you say that the people of this group represented similar
10:07
or diverse approaches to Judaism?
10:10
First
10:13
of
10:16
all, we didn't really talk about that, it wasn't important.
10:19
You ate.
10:21
We ate, exactly.
10:23
And
10:27
there were no services or anything.
10:28
Occasionally, people went to Portland or even to Salem, which had its synagogue
10:34
then, even though it didn't have a rabbi.
10:37
And that took care of it.
10:38
Most of us weren't deep into trying to live a full Jewish life.
10:46
So you really didn't feel as if you were a religious minority, exactly.
10:53
Or did you?
10:54
Well I don't know how you can separate that.
10:56
You're a Jew, you're a part of a religious minority.
11:02
There was nothing in town for us, let me put it that way.
11:05
We all felt that.
11:06
And as more and more people came, and they did come, especially with
11:10
children, because we came in '57, but '64 we had Hadassah already,
11:17
so what are we talking about there?
11:19
Six years, seven years.
11:22
So it was a rather rapid development.
11:25
The Schechters had two children who were already of school age.
11:30
Goheens had children school age.
11:36
Antons had children of school age.
11:41
So did Loneys.
11:43
And there was nothing for anybody.
11:45
And speaking of that, let's talk of your children, and when they were born
11:53
-- well you were pregnant when you came here, so that was your daughter, Sarah.
11:58
Yeah, all three of my children were born here, Danny and Joseph.
12:03
How many years later?
12:04
Oh they came quickly, one on top of another.
12:07
'57, '59 and
12:11
'60.
12:11
So by '64, we already had somebody in school, or approaching school.
12:17
And by that time the Philipps were also here with their children.
12:23
And so the number had grown rather rapidly in those seven years.
12:28
I don't remember who all was here.
12:30
But I remember vividly that the conversations began to revolve around,
12:37
"Well what are we going to do for the kids, we have all these kids." I
12:40
mean it seemed like a lot, it really wasn't, but we started counting them
12:44
up and we came up with 10, 15, 20 kids.
12:47
We're talking about pre-Hadassah now, aren’t we?
12:49
Pre-Hadassah, right.
12:52
These kinds of conversations occurred in our social gatherings,
12:55
either at Hanukah or Shavuot
13:00
or Passover or whatever.
13:01
And then something happened that I think was one of the kickers, kicker-offers,
13:07
and I don't remember the year, probably Ruth does, but Camp Adair was still
13:12
functioning, and there was I guess a chaplain there, and there were a couple
13:19
of Jewish doctors that were there, so Ben of course had been connected with that,
13:26
just socially and professionally I guess.
13:29
And they decided we had to have a Seder for the Jews of the community,
13:38
including any who happened to be stationed there at Camp Adair.
13:41
So we all thought that was a great idea and everybody helped in one way or
13:45
another, and we had a Seder, the first community Seder, which was at Camp Adair.
13:50
Well cullinarily it was a disaster, because there was a fire in the kitchen
13:53
or something and the chicken soup was so concentrated it was inedible.
13:59
We all remember that.
14:00
But as far as the service was concerned and the event, it was a smashing success.
14:06
And we all agreed that we had to do this every year, that this was important.
14:12
And I think maybe that's where the germ, the idea came from,
14:15
that, well, it was time that we started doing something officially.
14:18
But to back up just a speck, you were mentioning just before you
14:22
began to talk about this Seder, you mentioned some other Jewish holidays.
14:27
So did this little community of people gather on other holidays?
14:32
Yeah, we took every opportunity there was.
14:35
There was always a latke party at somebody's house for Hanukah.
14:40
And of course people had Seders, and
14:44
we would get together in smaller or larger groups, depending on who
14:48
had how many kids and so forth.
14:51
And there would be other times that we would get together and we would
14:56
have our own delicatessen kind of parties and things like that.
15:00
Food was a major part of it.
15:02
OK now, well you counted off all the kids and there may have been 15 or so,
15:06
and were efforts made to have some kind of Sunday school even before there was
15:11
any formal organization here at all.
15:13
No, because Salem Jewish community had a Sunday school.
15:18
I think the Loneys went there,
15:25
because that was a much older community than ours and was
15:29
in existence for a long time.
15:34
We had nothing that was the closest place.
15:37
So those people that had kids already of that age tended to take them there.
15:43
And then as more of the younger people came in, you know going to Salem every
15:48
Sunday, it was a schlep, and when the weather was bad it was even worse.
15:53
So I don't know who made the idea or how it really got started, I just
16:00
don't remember, but I remember that we finally called a meeting, and this
16:07
must have been in '63 or something like that -- oh, I know what happened.
16:13
The rational for this development, is what I was kind of interested in.
16:17
It was to do something for the kids, to start a Sunday school.
16:22
And we decided that we needed some kind of formal umbrella organization,
16:27
some affiliation, to do that with.
16:32
I had some friends from my Portland days who were very involved in
16:36
Hadassah, in fact who were on boards and all that kind of thing.
16:40
And one of the regional meetings, it must have been in '62 or '63, was in Eugene.
16:47
And so I drove down to attend the meeting to see what I could see.
16:54
And I got inspired there to establish a chapter of Hadassah.
16:59
So when I got back I called this meeting.
17:04
One thing led to another and we decided we would try to use an organization
17:09
to help us establish something for the children, and that we would investigate
17:14
several different organizations.
17:16
Just because I was all hot for Hadassah at the time, not everybody was.
17:20
Some people wanted to go for the National Council of Jewish Women, some for B'nai
17:26
B'rith Women, one thing or another.
17:28
So we spent a little time investigating those.
17:33
And I was very Zionistic, and I guess I kind of forced
17:40
the group in that direction.
17:43
Anyway, there wasn't any bad feeling or anything like that.
17:47
We were really looking at which organization could give us the
17:52
most support for a Sunday school.
17:55
There were also requirements, numerical requirements -- you
17:59
had to have a certain number -- I understood that was true anyway.
18:03
Yeah, yeah it is true.
18:05
But more importantly, I felt very strongly and I know others did too, that we
18:11
didn't want simply a social organization.
18:15
It had to have a Jewish philanthropic purpose.
18:21
So that's why we didn't simply want to start a Sunday school.
18:24
We wanted to do it under the egis of something else.
18:29
And although the purpose of Hadassah is not to start Sunday schools,
18:34
we all thought it was possible to do it that way, so we did.
18:39
We were supposed to have 15 members.
18:42
We only had 13.
18:44
So we decided, what the hell, we're going to do it our way, we'll start it anyway.
18:48
And so we did!
18:49
And so we were chartered in '64, which is officially when it began.
18:53
But
18:55
the movement started much before that.
18:57
But the purpose was very clear.
18:59
To organize a Sunday school, to have a Jewish women's organization with
19:05
a philanthropic base, and to try to, you know, find new members, bring new
19:12
families into the community, support a Jewish presence for ourselves.
19:19
We really weren't thinking of it in terms of "for Corvallis," but
19:22
"for ourselves." It was all hang together, support one another.
19:28
Well that's the story I wanted to hear, but there are a few questions that I have
19:33
asked other people and I will ask you too.
19:37
That,
19:40
it's hard for me to get myself into the exact timeframe here, but did your
19:46
children ever feel that they lacked something -- I don't know exactly
19:52
how old they were pre-Hadassah, that they didn't have a Sunday
19:58
school to go to, they didn't have...
20:01
Well pre-Hadassah they were really pre-school.
20:06
Hadassah started in '64, the last one was born in '60.
20:09
So '57,'59, '60.
20:10
So it would have been pretty early for that sort of thing to come about.
20:16
Couple of things I should say.
20:17
We, meaning Ze'ev and myself,
20:22
having come from very cosmopolitan kinds of backgrounds, and being of
20:26
liberal persuasion, felt very keenly the Christian homogeneity of this town.
20:34
When I joined the Faculty Wives Club, as it was called then, one of
20:40
the first questions whenever I went to these teas, "Well have you found
20:44
your church home in Corvallis yet?" I got pretty sick of answering that.
20:53
People used to, when they'd find out that we didn't have a Christmas
20:56
tree, for instance, some of Ze'ev's students found that out because he
21:02
was a young professor at that time and there was a lot of camaraderie there.
21:06
And a number of them who belonged to sororities, said, "We have a Christmas
21:11
tree in our house, and by the 15th of the month we're all gone, and
21:16
nobody looks at this tree. Can't we bring it to you, can't we give it
21:19
to you?" Thank you but no thank you.
21:22
They just didn't understand that.
21:24
And so we didn't want our kids to grow up thinking everybody in
21:28
this town was white, blond-haired, blue-eyed, and went to a church.
21:32
And so we made it a very active practice to bring home foreign students, which
21:38
we did very consistently for years.
21:43
But when the kids went to school, they -- we at that time fell into what
21:50
we now think of as a trap of going all out for Hanukah, to counteract Christmas.
21:57
So we decorated the house, and we strung blue and white popcorn and we made paper
22:03
triangles and strung them and all of that kind of thing and gave presents to
22:07
everyone every night and -- a big thing.
22:10
And we also spoke in the schools about what Hanukah was
22:14
like, all that kind of thing.
22:16
Well we've come away from that point of view now, but that's
22:19
kind of beside the point.
22:20
But it was clear that the schools were very into Christmas and
22:26
Easter and everything else.
22:28
And as the kids went through school it became increasingly obnoxious to us.
22:37
And at one point when Sarah was in kindergarten or first
22:40
grade, I don't remember which it was, she came home in tears.
22:47
What's the matter?
22:49
She said the name of her good friend that I knew, a little child who was
22:53
in her class, won't play with me.
22:55
Why won't she play with you?
22:58
Did you ask her?
22:59
She said, "Yes, she said that I didn't believe in Jesus." So that was
23:06
Sarah's first introduction, so that didn't take us very long, you know
23:09
here she was in the first grade and she was having that kind of problem.
23:14
And as the kids got older there were occasions where people would bump them
23:19
and mutter something about dirty Jew or whatever, write something on a locker.
23:25
It was always there and they always knew, but they were always identified
23:30
as Jewish students, and there was never any question of that in our house.
23:37
So I don't know whether subconsciously we got more involved because of these things
23:46
or whatever but it was just -- we never had a problem identifying, let me put it
23:50
that way, it was never even discussed.
23:53
It was just part of our lives.
23:57
Did you personally ever experience an anti-Semitic incident of some sort.
24:04
No.
24:06
Not in this town.
24:07
My family did in Lake Oswego.
24:10
My father tried to join a country club and was told the usual.
24:15
But
24:17
other than that, as far as I know, no.
24:20
I'm sure there are places I haven't been invited to.
24:30
There came a point in our living here when not only us, the Orzechs, but other
24:37
families as well, became increasingly unhappy with the school district's
24:45
response to religious difference.
24:48
For instance the Philipps always -- I don't know if Susie mentioned this -- had
24:53
troubles when her kids were in the high school, mainly with the chess team.
24:57
Yes, she told me that story.
24:58
It's on tape.
24:59
All right, I won't repeat that.
25:02
And our kids occasionally had difficulty with one thing or
25:06
another , but we were not observant so we weren't involved in that stuff.
25:09
But the business of the programs and Easter vacation and the amount of
25:16
time spent on all these holidays, Halloween and Christmas and
25:25
Valentine's Day and Easter -- it was just
25:30
overwhelmingly Christian, and we became increasingly unhappy with that.
25:35
Also the town had changed very dramatically.
25:38
There was a large, considerably larger number of foreign students than there had
25:44
been, most of whom were non-Christian, the Jewish community had grown, we
25:49
became aware that the Baha'is were here and they did not go along with
25:54
that, and also there's a number of other fundamental religions that don't
26:00
believe in celebrating Christmas in the schools and all the rest of that.
26:04
Anyway, I had become known to the school board and to the school superintendent,
26:13
Tom Wogaman, who just retired, through my work on the school board, on that
26:18
budget committee, which was not an elected position, it was an appointed position.
26:23
And
26:26
in conversations with him, I mentioned this kind of stuff to him and told him
26:34
that I was aware that a lot of people were really unhappy with this kind of thing.
26:39
And of course this was also the time when all over the country, cases were
26:43
being brought before courts, and the big thing about the cross on the top
26:48
of Skinner's Butte was constantly in the news for years, till it finally was
26:54
declared a secular symbol and was allowed.
26:58
And at one point I took Tom aside and I said, "You know, I'd be willing to
27:04
serve on a committee that would look into this." And when Tom Wogaman came
27:11
here, it was from Berkeley , and he had talked a lot about the things that
27:18
had gone on in Berkeley, in favor of diversification and equality and the
27:25
all the rest of that kind of thing.
27:26
So I guess he mulled that around a little bit, and at one point said
27:33
shortly after that that yeah, he thought that was a good idea, and would
27:36
I actually serve on such a committee, so of course I said yes immediately.
27:40
So he put together a committee, and it was really a pretty good committee.
27:45
It had all kinds of representation including people from the school system
27:51
itself, a music teacher, for instance, because music was a major part of this.
27:56
We had become increasingly unhappy with simply the amount of time, the whole month
28:00
of December went, and all of this stuff.
28:05
There was a Mormon, there was an evangelical, there were just
28:10
some other people, and it was headed by a Methodist minister.
28:15
Bob Burtner, who was an outstanding person, he and I became rather close.
28:23
And the charge of the committee was to examine the policy vis a
28:28
vis religion in the public schools.
28:32
So we did.
28:34
And we came up with the calendar, no religious terminology in the calendar, no
28:44
religious songs to be taught unless it was part of a music program that
28:50
was divorced from the celebration of the holiday, and that no religion
28:55
was to be celebrated in the school.
28:57
You could teach about it, in fact that was incumbent as part of the
29:02
curriculum, and we were all in favor of that, but it was not to be celebrated.
29:06
Well of course that gave rise to tremendous discussions.
29:10
Anyway, this, gave our report ultimately to the school board , and it was
29:18
decided, and maybe this was part of the regular policy, I don't remember,
29:22
that there had to be public hearings.
29:26
And those public hearings were something
29:31
fearsome.
29:31
And I remember vividly one at Jefferson school, and Ze'ev and I were in
29:37
attendance and it was packed, it was in what they called the cafetorium kind
29:42
of thing, gym and everything, and lots of seats set up and they were all full.
29:49
And Burtner was our spokesman and he was a very good spokesman.
29:54
Anyway, a lot of heat was generated over the calendar, the terminology
30:01
and all of that kind of thing.
30:03
And I don't remember what was said exactly, but the tone of all of the
30:08
comments from people were so hostile toward anyone who wasn't Christian or
30:15
who wanted to change this, that I found myself, when I became aware of what I
30:21
was doing, trying to fade into the wall.
30:27
There was no place to sit, so I was leaning against the back wall, and
30:30
at one point I was pressing myself.
30:33
. . OK I remember on the end of side one I was pressing myself into the wall.
30:39
That was the first hearing , public hearing, for the proposed policy.
30:47
There was a second hearing scheduled a week later, two weeks
30:52
later, something of that nature.
30:55
And I remember in between the first and the second hearings, the liberal
31:00
religious and secular communities got
31:06
themselves together and decided it was time that the other side was presented.
31:15
I know that we in the Jewish community felt very
31:20
-- threatened is not the right word, but nervous and uneasy about us presenting
31:26
this point of view, we being in the minority, we felt increasingly keenly
31:31
that we were in a minority, and we certainly didn't want to put ourselves
31:35
in the position of saying to the Christian community, "You can't be
31:40
Christian in the schools." Although that was exactly what we wanted to say.
31:46
There's a point at which you just have to be realistic.
31:49
But we felt very strongly that it was up to Christians to say
31:53
to each other instead of we.
31:58
And that was exactly what happened the second meeting, the tone was entirely
32:02
different, the audience was very different, although there was still
32:06
lots of evangelicals and fundamentalists there and so forth, but the tone
32:12
of the meeting was different, the people who presented were different,
32:15
and the reaction was very different.
32:20
Then the next step, I believe, was the school board to vote on this, which
32:26
they did at their next regular meeting, and they accepted the whole thing.
32:30
So it was a very great relief that this is what happened, and I remember I made
32:37
a speech which I can get you a copy of if you'd like, I have it in my files.
32:43
I would very much like to have that.
32:45
I thought it was a
32:52
very good speech myself, if I do say so, and for that reason I kept it, and
33:04
you can have it for the archives.
33:05
I'll give you a copy.
33:07
What happened then was the implementation of the policy, which is in a sense still
33:14
being hotly debated in some places.
33:17
There were teachers who were complaining to each other loudly, "Well we can't
33:21
even say Merry Christmas to one of our students because of this policy,"
33:25
which is utter nonsense, of course.
33:28
And for a while the committee itself monitored or attempted to monitor
33:33
the implementation of the policy, particularly vis a vis the programs
33:39
of -- the winter musical programs, which they then were called.
33:43
And there were some teachers who just blithely went about their teaching and
33:48
their lives without any change whatever, teaching religious songs to students,
33:53
and there were other teachers who did a beautiful job of doing, you know,
33:58
secular kinds of -- you know, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty
34:03
the Snowman, that all kind of thing.
34:06
And I continued to object to the inclusion of "I Have a Little Dreidel"
34:13
and "Sivivon Sov Sov Sov," you know, these silly little children's Hanukah
34:19
songs, which are fine for celebration of Hanukah, they in no way shape
34:23
or form qualify as great music.
34:27
And I continually made that point.
34:28
About the only Hanukah music that is worth anything is Judas Maccabaeus by Handel.
34:34
And nobody wanted to have anything to do with that.
34:38
But I have always been a lone voice in the wilderness on that particular subject.
34:44
But anyway, we kept on plugging away, and gradually over a number of years
34:49
the emphasis on Christmas lessened in the school and it became much better.
34:55
Once my kids were out of school, I kind of got out of the monitoring business
34:59
and I really haven't paid much attention since, although I know that every
35:04
year various of the Israeli mothers or fathers who have children in the schools
35:11
and come on sabbatical here are called to talk about Hanukah in the schools.
35:16
And we've discussed this with not only local Jews but also the Israelis,
35:21
trying to get them to see that this is nothing but an excuse to then
35:26
talk about Christmas in the schools.
35:31
The Israelis simply do not understand our concept of separation of church and state,
35:35
since that's not the way Israel works.
35:37
And lots of Americans believe it's better to have some Hanukah in
35:43
the schools than nothing at all.
35:45
Well this is a philosophical political difference.
35:48
I still believe we were co-opted years ago, and I no longer
35:53
participate in that kind of thing.
35:55
I don't know what the new school superintendent will be like.
35:58
But there is certainly much more awareness and cognizance of all kinds
36:05
of difference in the public schools.
36:08
And that’s partly because of the great number of international non-Christian
36:12
students in the schools, and also the fact that the Jewish community has grown, and
36:18
other communities are much more willing to speak up when they believe their
36:23
rights are being ignored or trampled on.
36:26
So I am delighted to see that, and I feel very good that I
36:29
was a part of that movement.
36:34
I don't know what else I can tell you.
36:35
I think we've probably covered pretty much everything unless
36:39
you want to ask some more.
