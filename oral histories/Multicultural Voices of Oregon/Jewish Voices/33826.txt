00:02
This tape was recorded in Corvallis on Sept 20, 1991.
00:09
The interviewee is Ruth Goldberg.
00:13
The interviewer is Judith Berlowitz.
00:22
I understand that when you came to Corvallis in 1942, there were perhaps
00:29
five other Jewish families here.
00:31
I've read that -- well before I ask you that, can you remember
00:37
who some of those people were?
00:38
Yes, that's the only thing I wrote down.
00:42
The Fastens, the Friedmans,
00:46
the Ellisons were all at the college.
00:51
The Reicharts had a -- I think a cleaning store here, cleaning and
00:59
dying or whatever, and they had two children that were at the college,
01:04
taught, and then the Konicks, who had the jewelry store here in Corvallis.
01:12
And in Albany was Sam Frager, that's the only one we knew, who
01:17
had the furniture store there.
01:20
You mean the only person you knew in Albany?
01:22
Yes, the only one we knew of in Albany.
01:26
And it is
01:29
now, it's right as you come over the bridge going into Albany, it's
01:33
McMahan's, it is now McMahan's.
01:35
But Frager had it there for years and years and years.
01:40
I'm a little bit unclear about the people that had two children.
01:44
Were they of college age did you say or were they
01:47
-- They taught.
01:48
They were teachers at the college, and their children were younger.
01:51
Young children?
01:53
I didn't know them, I only knew -- I knew the girl, Natalie Reichart
01:57
and her brother, that taught, but I didn't know their families at all.
02:04
Do you know where any of these families came from before they were here?
02:09
Oh before they were here the Friedmans came from the middle
02:14
west, I don't know exactly where.
02:18
And
02:22
Sarah Konick came from Portland; her husband, I do not know where he came from.
02:31
He, the husband was European, I don't know where he came from.
02:37
I don't know where the Fastens came from.
02:40
And I
02:44
don't know where the Fragers came from, no, I really don't.
02:46
OK, so what brought you to Corvallis?
02:51
World War II.
02:53
My husband felt that we wouldn't win the war unless you were in it.
02:59
So he volunteered.
03:02
And he got his orders and he was sent to Camp Adair in Corvallis.
03:10
And that's how we came here in 1942.
03:13
And where did you come from?
03:15
Chicago.
03:17
We were both born, raised and married in Chicago.
03:21
Did you have any children at that time?
03:23
Yes, I have one daughter, and that was it.
03:26
How old was she in 1942?
03:29
She was about three or four.
03:31
What's her name?
03:32
Elaine.
03:33
Oh.
03:36
OK.
03:39
Were you born in Chicago?
03:40
And you grew up there too.
03:43
Where did your husband serve during the war?
03:46
Here.
03:46
Oh he was here that entire
03:48
-- Oh no, no.
03:49
He was here -- we were here for two years.
03:53
Then he got his orders to go to France.
03:55
And he was there for two years.
03:58
And
04:01
his office was running in Chicago for the entire time.
04:06
He was a roentgenologist.
04:09
That was before radiologists.
04:12
I see.
04:13
Did you mean in Chicago.
04:14
You said his office in Chicago.
04:16
Yes, when he came here, when he was sent here to the army, he
04:22
got another roentgenologist to run his office.
04:26
So it was running the entire time, it was open the entire time that he was here.
04:33
And after two years, we were here for two years, and then
04:37
he was sent overseas to France.
04:41
And I decided that, I didn't go back to Chicago because I liked the West Coast,
04:50
and I decided that if I went back to Chicago we would never locate here.
04:55
And he had a license to practice in California cause he interned at
04:59
the Los Angeles County Hospital.
05:02
So he had a license, so we were going to settle in California.
05:09
So when he came back from overseas, which was over two years, in 1946,
05:19
we toured the West Coast, and one for the local doctors
05:25
here made my husband an offer.
05:29
He couldn't refuse?
05:30
He couldn't refuse.
05:31
He offered to give him his office space and to loan him an x-ray
05:37
machine until he could get one.
05:41
And the price was right, but my husband didn't have license to
05:47
practice here, and he had to take
05:51
the, I forget what you call it
05:53
. . . Exam?
05:54
Certification?
05:58
I'll think of it.
05:59
Well anyway, in the meantime, while we were here, we met the Friedmans.
06:05
He was a professor of chemistry, and he's the one that tutored my
06:10
husband in chemistry, because my husband had been out for a while, and
06:14
chemistry was all together different.
06:17
For this examination?
06:19
Right, right.
06:21
So Ben took the exam.
06:25
He said, "I will take the exam here. If I pass it we'll stay. If
06:31
I don't we'll go to California." Well needless to say, he passed it.
06:36
And so he opened the first x-ray office in Corvallis, the first doctor.
06:47
And one of the doctors told him he would never make a go of it here because
06:52
every doctor had his own x-ray machine.
06:57
And Ben said, if I can't make it as a roentgenologist, I will
07:04
go back into general practice.
07:10
It wasn't easy, but we made it.
07:15
In x-ray?
07:16
In x-ray.
07:19
And he had a nurse in Chicago that stayed in Chicago working for the other doctor
07:25
while he was overseas, and his nurse came out here to be with him, with her mother.
07:33
And it was very nice.
07:36
Did she stay with him for a number of years?
07:38
She stayed with him until she got married and left, but she
07:42
stayed with him for many years.
07:45
And worked for him for practically nothing, because in the beginning,
07:53
it wasn't very lucrative.
07:54
Yes I understand.
07:57
And the practice I suppose wasn't very large for a while.
08:00
That's right.
08:01
That's right.
08:03
But
08:06
it took time.
08:09
It always does.
08:10
Right.
08:11
Well I understand that in 1943, which was the year after you got here, I read
08:18
that Corvallis Jewish families hosted a
08:23
[tape cuts out] . Do you remember that?
08:27
Well we hosted many.
08:30
Some were at Camp Adair and some were at our house.
08:34
You see I can't remember what was at our house and what wasn't, but anything Jewish
08:41
or pertaining to anything that was Jewish was at our house, because my husband
08:48
instigated everything and anything.
08:56
We had JA representatives always came to our house.
09:01
We had Seders at our house.
09:02
Every Sunday, service men came to our house and we made
09:08
potato pancakes for them.
09:10
Every week?
09:11
Every Sunday.
09:14
One would grate, one would peel.
09:19
I fried.
09:21
This was a long time ago.
09:23
Yes!
09:24
Well you had quite an extended family then.
09:27
Were these servicemen here
09:29
. . . There were maybe a half a dozen or so.
09:32
All the Jewish servicemen, They were at Camp -- there were 95,000
09:39
soldiers at Camp Adair in the heyday.
09:42
It was tremendous.
09:44
I've seen the pictures at the Horner Museum, at the museum in Philomath,
09:48
about Camp Adair in those days.
09:51
But what I was asking you was, about how long did most of these
09:56
servicemen stay here in service.
10:02
Well until they were activated and then sent overseas, you see.
10:08
They were all activated here and then they were sent to like Texas or
10:12
somewhere, that's like my husband was sent to Texas and then on to overseas.
10:20
I really don't know how long they stayed.
10:22
That's OK.
10:22
But you got to know these servicemen fairly well.
10:26
Coming to your house every week.
10:29
So they were here for a period of months?
10:31
Yes, yes, maybe months.
10:35
But then they also had dinners on various occasions at Camp Adair,
10:43
and that's how I worked with Mrs. Sarah Konick and Sally Friedman.
10:50
I can't remember if Selma was here, I don't know if she was in school or what.
10:55
I can't remember her.
10:56
When you said they had these affairs, you actually mean you as a group of
11:04
Jewish people had for the servicemen.
11:07
This did not stem from the service, it came from this Jewish community.
11:10
Ah that I can't tell you, I don’t know.
11:14
I don't know.
11:15
But you were the ones that facilitated
11:17
-- Right.
11:17
But we worked out there.
11:20
We worked out there at the various dinners.
11:26
We're talking about the Seder, which is a Passover celebration, and there
11:31
were others that you're talking about.
11:33
Yes,
11:37
yes.
11:37
The high holidays.
11:40
They did have a, they did have a rabbi out there.
11:49
In fact, I hear from him every year still
11:55
. . . What was his name?
11:56
Is his name, I should say.
11:58
My goodness I forgot already.
12:00
But I do hear from him every year.
12:02
When you get to be my age you can't remember very well anymore.
12:05
Kravitz!
12:09
Rabbi Kravitz.
12:12
He must be getting up in years.
12:13
Yes, he's retired and he lives in Arizona.
12:17
Oh that's wonderful!
12:19
And I hear from him every year at the high holidays, he sends a card.
12:24
So we talked about these early families, you named them off, and I wanted to ask
12:30
you how you would describe the approach to Judaism that the various ones took.
12:38
Were they observant, did they tend to be more orthodox or more
12:45
reformed or somewhere in the middle, more conservative, would you say?
12:50
Oh I don't think too many of them practiced.
12:55
The only ones I would say were the Konicks, and the Fragers in
13:03
Albany.
13:05
But the others
13:10
I don’t think they did anything Jewish until we came here,
13:14
really, I don't think they did.
13:16
Because I don't think they were interested.
13:20
Well of course there being no formal organization
13:25
-- Right, could be, could be
13:27
. . . And very little leadership
13:29
-- During that time, we used to -- Salem had
13:35
a Jewish community.
13:36
We went to Salem for the high holidays, that's about it.
13:43
I think you've already answered this question, or I could
13:49
. . . determine what the answer would be from the way you've described some of
13:53
the activities here, but the question was, how did you feel being a member
14:01
of such a small religious minority, having come from a large city.
14:06
I imagine in Chicago, you were part of a very large group.
14:12
Yeah, well,
14:16
I didn't feel out of place at all, because
14:22
we didn't live, when I was growing up, we never lived in the Jewish community.
14:29
So we had friends both ways, and
14:37
we knew we were Jews, and when we came here, that's the first
14:41
thing we tried to contact.
14:46
But we had no problems, no problems.
14:50
Did any of the other families ever experience or sense prejudice against
14:57
Jewish people during those early years?
15:00
If they did, I don't know.
15:01
I never felt any prejudices here . Now I know there's been hate
15:06
mail around but I never got it.
15:08
That's of a much later time, and we are really talking here about
15:14
-- What they said behind my back I don't know.
15:18
But my husband was very much oriented into community affairs.
15:27
I was going to ask you, how familiar did you find non-Jewish
15:33
people with the basics of Judaism?
15:38
Did people know what Jewish people did or what they were like, or
15:42
did they have ideas about them?
15:44
Non-Jewish people?
15:45
Some asked, but not many.
15:48
But not many.
15:49
And that's about all I can say.
15:52
But they all knew that whatever was coming, whoever was coming
15:59
through, would come to our house.
16:01
Or whatever, any Jewish holidays or anything like that would always be.
16:09
So you're saying the non-Jewish people knew that you were
16:11
headquarters as well as the Jewish
16:14
-- Right, right.
16:16
Were you ever asked to explain Judaism to any groups or anything
16:22
like that in a more formal way?
16:23
I wasn't but my husband was.
16:25
He once gave a speech, and I think I still have it, and he would say, "Being
16:33
a Jew is a challenge, and I accept that challenge." He was quite a man.
16:39
He's the best thing that ever happened to me!
16:42
That's a wonderful statement to make, and while we're at it, I would love to borrow
16:46
and make a copy of that speech, it belongs
16:49
-- I'm going to see if I
16:51
-- In the archives.
16:52
Oh it's a beautiful speech.
16:54
I shall look it up.
16:56
I think I still, I know I have it, if I can find it.
17:01
I'd appreciate it.
17:02
He belonged to a . . . this is after we settled here, he belonged to a little
17:08
group, they were known as the Dirty Dozen.
17:11
They met, I think once a week, and there was another doctor, a Jewish doctor here,
17:18
Dr. Krakauer, have you heard of him?
17:20
No.
17:22
Way back in the '40s now, perhaps?
17:24
This is back in, no this was later, this was in the '50s.
17:31
When the town was growing and new doctors came in.
17:38
And Dr. Krakauer, he was from Harvard, very good doctor.
17:45
Unfortunately he had a back injury and is not practicing anymore.
17:51
But he and Ben and a few of the city fathers, the head of the
18:00
GT [Corvallis Gazette Times] and I can't remember who all was in there,
18:06
they would get together once a week and discuss the world's problems.
18:10
And they were called
18:11
. . . They were called the Dirty Dozen.
18:14
Why did they pick that name?
18:15
I don't know
18:18
[laughs]
18:18
. Because they probably told it like it was.
18:19
Was
18:22
that informal organization in existence for a number of years?
18:28
Yes it was, I think until my husband passed away.
18:32
I think they met all the time.
18:34
He was very interested in
18:39
teaching people about Judaism and he was very well liked here.
18:47
Very well liked.
18:48
Besides being a very good doctor.
18:50
I'm sure that's true.
18:52
I've heard that many times.
18:54
Let's talk a little bit about the religious education for the children.
19:01
These people and other early settlers we'll call them.
19:07
Until the establishment of the first Sunday school which was in
19:12
'64, what happened with the kids?
19:13
Now I don't know when the Orzechs came here, but he was instrumental
19:19
in teaching Hebrew to the children.
19:23
But the kids went to Salem.
19:26
Salem
19:29
-- they didn't have a -- I think in the beginning they didn't have
19:32
a rabbi, but they had somebody there, I really don't know.
19:38
Let's talk about Sunday school per se.
19:42
Was there any Sunday school here for the kids?
19:45
No.
19:47
There were no Jews here!
19:51
Well I'm talking about -- you came with your daughter, and there were
19:56
these people that you mentioned -- did they have young children?
19:59
The Friedmans had children but they were not interested.
20:03
And the others -- I think the others had -- the Fastens, I think
20:08
their children were grown, and the Ellisons didn't have any children.
20:14
And the Fragers were from Albany, they
20:23
. . . Do you remember some of the early efforts to educate young children?
20:28
As the years went by and other people came and there were young children here.
20:32
And this is before there was any kind of formal organizations.
20:35
It think it was Orzech.
20:36
I can't be sure but I think it was he.
20:43
I understand that a Hillel chapter, a Jewish organization for students on
20:48
campus, was established at OCE [Oregon College of Education, Monmouth] in 1948.
20:52
What kinds of interaction occurred between Hillel members and this Jewish community?
20:57
I can't remember.
20:59
I can't remember what ever happened.
21:02
But
21:06
. . . There was a fellow who was head of Hillel for a long time.
21:09
I don't know if it was
21:13
-- I don't know who took on Hillel.
21:15
I can't remember.
21:16
Ellison, I think.
21:17
Ellison, yes, that is true.
21:23
Then as far as you know
21:25
-- We had nothing to do with
21:27
-- Then in those years there was not any close interaction at
21:30
all with the Jewish students
21:31
-- No, I think the Ellisons, I think they used to have a few of
21:36
the Hillel boys to their home.
21:39
And he possibly used to talk to them at the school.
21:43
But other than that I can't remember anything about Hillel.
21:52
It seems that the Jewish people in Corvallis remained about
21:56
the same for a number of years, the numbers is what I mean.
22:00
When did the number of Jewish people begin to increase, do you know?
22:10
Roughly?
22:12
It just sort of creeps up on you, you know?
22:14
I really don't know.
22:17
I think the Orzechs and the Schecters
22:26
and I can't remember, maybe a few more came.
22:31
Then . . . Mimi Orzech was very instrumental in doing community things.
22:39
She's the one that, I'm sure it was Mimi, who started a ladies,
22:45
a women's organization here.
22:48
And at first we were going to have B'nai B'rith, and I had some friends
22:54
in Salem who were B'nai B'rithers, and I would have liked B'nai
22:59
B'rith, but they wouldn't accept us because we didn't have enough, so
23:08
we took Hadassah.
23:13
And I can't remember but you must have that, when that
23:21
-- '64. But we're concerned here with prior to that.
23:26
Somewhere between this small number of people here in the
23:31
'40s and possibly a little later.
23:36
There was an influx, I think, from what I've gathered, and I was just
23:41
wondering if you remember that and if you know what caused that.
23:43
I can't remember
23:50
. . . it possibly was, school was growing and more Jewish professors, and
23:56
then . . . well, it was later that the Israelis came, I think that was later.
24:03
I can't remember, I really can't.
24:06
I don't know.
24:07
I don't know.
24:08
The only thing is that year by year the town grew and more and more doctors
24:15
came, but I can't remember what the influx of Jews were, when it started.
24:17
I just don't
24:25
know.
24:28
As you look back on the years when the young Jewish community was very small and
24:33
maintaining its identity despite the lack of a formal religious organization, what
24:40
are your fondest memories of those years.
24:43
Before Hadassah was established, before Beit Am was established.
24:52
I think the fondest memories were, because there were so few Jews
24:58
here at that time, and some of the faculty at the college, there was
25:07
not too good relationships between them.
25:12
So we found friction there.
25:15
Are you talking about all Jewish people now?
25:18
Faculty members?
25:20
Yes.
25:20
The Jewish faculty.
25:21
Some of the Jewish faculty.
25:23
Some of the names that I gave you.
25:25
There was friction there.
25:27
So
25:30
. . . it was a little difficult.
25:34
But we were friendly with all of them, but didn't see them too often.
25:40
And at that time, my husband was establishing a practice, and
25:49
there weren't too many Jewish people that we had contact with here in Corvallis.
25:56
Can you describe if you don't mind, the nature of this friction?
26:02
What caused this friction?
26:04
I don't know.
26:05
It was that way when we came in '42.
26:10
This family didn't like this family, and
26:12
. . . I just wondered if it was on personal grounds or if it was
26:17
perhaps on religious grounds.
26:18
No, no, I don't think it was religion at all.
26:21
Because I don't think any of these families were religious.
26:25
No, I think it was personal, it was personal.
26:30
But we became very friendly with the Friedmans.
26:32
They were a lovely, lovely couple.
26:37
And after he died, and my husband passed away, she and I traveled all over the
26:46
world for about 10 years straight.
26:49
It was a very good relationship.
26:52
And then she passed away.
26:54
Sometimes one hears that there's a situation that's described as "town
27:01
and gown," that the townspeople are one group and the university people
27:08
or academic people are another group.
27:10
Now I know there were not many Jewish people here who were not in some way
27:14
connected with the university, but was there ever any feeling like that, well
27:19
we're academics and we're over here, we're town people and we're over here?
27:23
If there were, I don't know cause I didn't feel it, you see.
27:27
But I'm sure there must have been.
27:30
But I don't know.
27:31
I don't know.
27:34
We had no problems.
27:39
There were certain things, certain
27:46
organizations that didn't invite us, that I know.
27:51
That I know.
27:53
But
27:56
other than that, why we had no problems at all.
28:02
And to bring us full circle, we get back to the fact that Corvallis has
28:10
been an ideal place for you to live.
28:14
You've been very happy here, you said.
28:18
I did a lot of civic work in the beginning.
28:20
My husband was very
28:21
-- Tell me what.
28:22
Well, Ben was very involved in the old hospital.
28:27
The hospital that was located on Harrison Street.
28:31
That used to be where the nursing home is, Heart of the Valley.
28:36
First of all my husband was involved in changing their entry from one place
28:41
to another, and that's way before they decided to build the new hospital.
28:50
In fact when he died, they named a room after my husband, and when he passed
28:56
away, the GT had a beautiful editorial.
29:03
I still have it.
29:05
And then
29:07
-- We'd like a copy of that too for the archives.
29:09
Then
29:13
-- Excuse me one moment, tell me about this entry.
29:16
He changed . . . he was instrumental in changing the entry.
29:19
What was the issue there?
29:21
One was on the . . . it was on the back of Harrison Street, the entry, I think.
29:32
It was either one way or the other.
29:34
Anyway he was instrumental in changing it from the back of
29:38
Harrison to the front of Harrison.
29:42
And my husband was very instrumental -- what's his name at the Episcopal,
29:48
father . . . the original
29:54
minister at the
30:00
Episcopalian Church.
30:03
See they later took over the hospital.
30:08
My God I can't
30:11
. . . Well I'll think of it.
30:12
Anyway, my husband and he used to go to Portland to see the bishop, and
30:20
there were many things pertaining to the hospital that my husband helped.
30:27
Then when they decided to build the new hospital, or when they decided to
30:36
remodel it, then he came to me and asked me if I would head the women's division.
30:42
To collect money for the hospital.
30:45
Isn't that terrible, I can't even think of his name.
30:52
Well, whatever.
30:54
So I worked at that for quite a while.
30:57
Then I worked for the Red Cross for about 10 years.
31:02
Then after that, why
31:06
. . . now I'm playing!
31:09
You're allowed.
31:09
[End of Side]
31:10
[Beginning of Side]
31:13
Can you tell me any anecdotes of all those wonderful experiences you had?
31:20
Well I can remember one Sunday when we were having our weekly pancake feed,
31:30
and there were about six or eight of the enlisted men at our house -- only
31:36
enlisted men, maybe one or two officers.
31:39
When the doorbell rang and my husband answered and it
31:45
was one of the enlisted men.
31:47
I don't
31:53
how he came to our house, but whatever, he came to our house and he shows
31:59
my husband a gun, and he says to my husband, "I'm going to kill myself."
32:07
Of course I didn't know anything about this, this was at the door.
32:10
So my husband led him into the bedroom and closed the door and
32:15
talked to him, and pretty soon the gun was on the bed, and he was in
32:23
with the rest of us eating pancakes.
32:25
Now what happened after that I can't remember, or I don't know,
32:30
but that was quite an incident.
32:34
I don't remember many like that.
32:36
That's a very unusual happening.
32:39
Not everyone undergoes anything quite like that!
32:46
Well I understand that in 1947 there was a Jewish women's sewing
32:51
group who made clothes for Israel.
32:54
How did this come about?
32:58
I can't remember who organized the group.
33:03
It could have been Sarah Konick but I'm not sure.
33:08
But we met and we sewed.
33:12
Where did you meet?
33:13
We met at different people's homes, and we sewed little garments for Israel.
33:24
And I can't remember how long
33:29
. . . I think we met once a month, but I'm not sure, and I don't remember
33:34
how long that lasted, but we did sew little garments for Israel.
33:40
For young children.
33:44
Kimonos mostly.
33:47
Possibly diapers, I'm not sure, but kimonos I remember.
33:52
That's about it.
