The date is July 23, 1991.
00:19
The interviewer is Judith Berlowitz.
00:24
The interviewee is Jacqueline Gordon.
00:30
When did you and your family move to Corvallis?
00:33
We moved in the fall of 1966.
00:37
My husband came back here to get his PhD, so we came with the family at that time.
00:44
Who were the members of your family?
00:47
We have three children.
00:49
There's my husband, Louis Gordon, who's with Oceanography, and the
00:53
three children are Judy, our oldest daughter, Dianne, who's the middle
00:59
daughter, and Justin, our son.
01:02
They were born in '58, '60, and '61.
01:07
Do you recall the population of Corvallis, roughly, at the time you moved here?
01:13
I think it was about 29,000.
01:15
And what year was that again?
01:18
1966.
01:19
Roughly how many Jewish families would you say were here?
01:24
I don't know exactly.
01:25
I do know that Hadassah, which had started a couple of years earlier, had 13 members.
01:30
And I'm
01:34
sure that by the time we got here there were more like 20.
01:39
However, that probably means there were at least double that number.
01:44
Could you say that the majority of these families represented one of the
01:49
three main branches of Judaism: the orthodox, the conservative, or the reform?
01:57
I do know that one of the families was orthodox, but I think then they
02:04
ran from there to the full extreme.
02:06
I know of another family who, they felt themselves very Jewish but they included
02:13
no formal religious training whatsoever.
02:17
How would you describe the occupational makeup of the Jewish population?
02:24
Were they mainly academic or other professional people, or business people?
02:31
I think heavily academic, although we did have some people who were
02:37
business people and some retirees.
02:40
What Jewish organizations were in existence at the time you moved here?
02:45
Well I've already mentioned Hadassah, which is
02:50
a Jewish women's organization.
02:52
The other organization was the Hillel, the OSU Jewish student organization.
03:01
What activities did Hillel sponsor?
03:05
I can remember those early days they were very active, and sponsored
03:12
particularly a very nice lox and
03:18
bagel breakfast,
03:21
to which not only did the students come and the faculty, but the
03:26
community people were welcome as well.
03:30
And Hadassah?
03:31
What are the kinds of activities it sponsored?
03:36
They had monthly meetings, in which they both conducted their business and had
03:42
outside speakers about Jewish things.
03:47
One of their most important early businesses was the sponsoring of the
03:51
Sunday school, and the other thing was a fundraising event which at that time
03:56
was a latke breakfast, to which the entire Corvallis community was invited.
04:03
What was a latke?
04:04
A latke is a potato pancake made from grated raw potatoes.
04:10
And it's fried.
04:11
So, at the breakfast, we were frying, frying all morning long to supply
04:18
latkes for all the people who arrived.
04:21
It was a lot of
04:27
work.
04:27
[tape stops and resumes.] The reason I laughed is that some funny things did
04:30
happen relative to the latke breakfast.
04:34
One year . . . we were always trying to find ways to make it easy to fix the
04:38
potatoes, since they're raw potatoes.
04:40
So we tried to get a commercial outfit to give us the grated raw potato, and
04:46
it ended up we picked them up one time and they were grated, they were cooked!
04:52
So it caused a lot of consternation since that happened on the morning
04:57
we were having the brunch itself.
05:00
Finally they got so unhappy about all the work involved -- those of us who
05:06
fried would go home just reeking of the oil in our clothes -- someone had
05:12
the bright idea to switch from latkes to blintzes, which we could prepare
05:17
those ahead of time, freeze them,
05:21
so we didn't have all the work the day of the brunch.
05:26
Did you do that later?
05:29
Yes.
05:29
I don't remember how many years we did the latke dinner, but then
05:32
we switched over to blintz brunch.
05:34
Tell me something
05:38
about the Sunday school.
05:40
You mentioned that Hadassah really came into being in order
05:47
to organize the Sunday school.
05:49
Yes, some of the members of Hadassah had young children and they were
05:54
concerned about having some Jewish education for their children.
05:57
So one of the prime reasons for having a formal organization was
06:03
to get a Sunday school started.
06:05
This was a cooperative Sunday school, in which the parents were very
06:08
involved, some of them would teach.
06:10
Hadassah
06:17
sponsored that for quite a number of years until it separated off
06:21
into a separate organization.
06:23
About how many children would you say were there during those early years?
06:28
I'm guessing it was 15-20.
06:33
They I know had three or four classes.
06:36
In the early days they had a teenage group as well, which we
06:41
haven't had for a number of years.
06:44
And you say some of the parents served as teachers.
06:47
Were there other people who served in that capacity?
06:50
Yes, most of them were either parents or
06:54
students from OSU.
06:56
How was the curriculum developed?
06:58
In those days each teacher developed his own curriculum.
07:04
So we tried to find teachers who had Jewish knowledge as
07:07
well as ability to teach.
07:10
Were there holiday celebrations in the Sunday school?
07:14
Always.
07:15
That's one of the things they did was always have parties for the
07:20
children at the major holidays, such as building a sukkot at one
07:26
of the homes and having a party.
07:31
What was a sukkot?
07:34
A sukkot was a temporary hut or structure.
07:37
You have to see through it, be able to see the stars.
07:40
At
07:43
a bare minimum, it's setting up four posts so you have the structure for
07:48
four walls and the basis for a ceiling.
07:51
Instead of a solid ceiling, we put up things like greenery, branches,
08:00
old corn plants, things of this sort,
08:05
to make a temporary roof.
08:07
And this celebrates.
08:09
. . Succot.
08:11
The other holidays that we always had something, we always had a Purim party,
08:16
usually something at Hanukah time, and, let's see, at Passover, we always had
08:22
a model Seder, we developed a small Haggadot for the children on that.
08:27
And at Shavuot, we usually had a picnic and read Ruth.
08:33
What about religious services for adults.
08:36
Were they held regularly?
08:37
Were there any?
08:39
Well early on there were none.
08:40
At least other than what I suspect -- I believe the orthodox family always had
08:46
their own services in their own home.
08:48
But as far as the community was concerned, the earliest services I
08:51
remember were through the Sunday school.
08:53
They tried to have one or two during the year, just to give the children an
08:58
idea of what the services were like.
09:00
In addition, we tried to take them to some town to attend
09:04
the services at a synagogue.
09:08
Where were the services held?
09:11
When the Sunday school did it, the earliest services I remember,
09:16
there was a meeting hall,
09:20
Consumer's Power had a building over on 9th Street, and we used
09:27
to meet in that room for a number of these parties and the service.
09:34
Later on as the Hillel became interested in it,
09:41
since they would co-sponsor the services, we would have them at Oregon
09:44
State University in the Memorial Union.
09:48
Who conducted the services?
09:51
Well I wouldn't know about the ones before we arrived, but
09:57
I'm remembering Ze'ev Orzech on the services.
10:01
When Joyce Shane became involved in it, they did it together,
10:06
Ze'ev doing the non-singing part and Joyce doing all of the songs.
10:14
They were a nice combination, They were so popular with Hillel and the community that
10:19
when we did have them in the course of the year, we'd have as many as 50 people.
10:27
You mentioned earlier something about Hadassah changing -- a social
10:35
event that was changed from serving latkes to later on serving blintzes.
10:43
That's correct.
10:43
I think that was suggested by Ruth Goldberg, who's a very good cook!
10:48
The idea being that we could make the blitzes ahead of time so we could have
10:56
them frozen so that the day of the brunch you could be warming them up but
11:01
not doing all of the preparatory work.
11:04
It made it much easier.
11:05
The brunch also became -- more and more people kept coming to
11:12
it, so this became feasible.
11:13
With the latke dinner we would never have been able to serve as many people.
11:18
Can you describe a blintz for us?
11:21
A blintz is primarily made from a very thin pancake, an egg pancake, which
11:29
is then rolled around a filling which is made of -- well I tend to think of
11:35
it as cottage, but it's really cream cheese and a dry cottage cheese, with
11:42
usually some spicing to make it sweet.
11:49
Cinnamon and that sort of thing.
11:51
You mentioned a minute ago that more and more people began to come
11:57
to this -- was it an annual affair?
12:01
Yes, it was done annually.
12:03
I don't know what the earlier ones were, I suspect just like a hundred,
12:06
and now it's more like 500 people.
12:09
Oh so it's open to the entire community?
12:11
Oh yes, this is a fundraiser, and the entire Corvallis community is invited
12:20
by means of ads and postcards to those they think are most interested.
12:26
So these activities that we've talked about, the Sunday school increased as time
12:34
went on and the blintz brunch sponsored by Hadassah became larger and larger
12:40
. . . and I imagine from your description there were more services provided for both
12:51
the children and adults as time went on.
12:53
And I understand that in the early '70s there became
13:04
a need recognized, I should say, for a
13:11
building to house all of these various organizations under
13:18
one, shall we say, umbrella.
13:20
Well in a sense, yes, a building, but I think the first idea was to get an
13:24
organization, which was broader than a woman's organization or a student
13:30
organization or a Sunday school.
13:33
One that would not be in competition with these but would rather help
13:37
coordinate their activities and add to it.
13:43
In fact it was a meeting of
13:49
three couples, the Orzechs, the Philipps and the Gordons,
13:54
on campus, OSU campus one day.
13:57
At that particular time, Ze'ev was very involved in the Sunday school.
14:03
I was principal of it, Lou, my
14:07
husband was the Hillel counselor.
14:12
I believe at that time Susie was teaching in the Sunday school [Mrs.
14:16
Philipp], I'm
14:20
not sure.
14:22
. . anyway Kurt had been very involved in Hillel earlier [Mr.
14:31
Philipp].
14:31
So we got together and said that there was a need for an additional group that
14:37
would involve the men as well as the women, and would have a broader community,
14:43
respond to broader community needs.
14:45
So from there we had an organizational meeting at the Philipps' and at
14:50
that meeting, various committees were established, and a coordinating
14:55
council which would be the chairmen of each of these committees.
15:00
And it came eventually to be called Beit Am.
15:03
How were you involved in this besides what you have already said here?
15:07
I think I was asked to chair that first organizational
15:12
meeting, and went on to chair the
15:17
coordinating committee meetings as well, and when we ended up
15:22
having bylaws that were established
15:27
and I
15:33
was elected as one of the early board member, and then elected by
15:36
the board to be the first president.
15:37
Was
15:41
the Jewish community polled, involved in making the decision whether
15:48
or not to acquire a building?
15:53
They were, after . . . I know we've had several polls once Beit Am was organized,
16:01
and one of the purposes of that was eventually having a building, but in the
16:07
early days, Beit Am ended up being, as I said -- well for instance the board
16:14
contained seven elected members from Beit Am, plus three who were representatives
16:21
from the then-active organizations: the Sunday school, Hillel and Hadassah.
16:28
Hadassah
16:32
was asking to be relieved of some of the things they'd been doing for
16:35
the community -- they attempted a newsletter, they had the Seder at that
16:41
time, and asked that Beit Am either take them over or co-sponsor things.
16:46
So we've co-sponsored the Seder with them since then -- Beit Am has cosponsored
16:51
the Seder with Hadassah since then.
16:54
And they actually took over the newsletter, but Hadassah
16:59
subsidizes it with a little bit of funds, because all of their
17:02
news goes into Beit Am rather than putting out a separate newsletter.
17:06
We've always attempted not to be in competition with each other
17:11
but rather to help each other and coordinate our activities.
17:14
We're just too small to do anything otherwise.
17:15
So the transition was relatively smooth from separate entities into
17:22
. . . Well these are still separate entities except for the Sunday school.
17:24
Eventually the Sunday school simply became a part of Beit Am, and was, even from
17:30
the beginning of Beit Am, was considered to be sponsored by Beit Am financially.
17:36
When we started doing minimal dues, it was considered that the broader community
17:43
would be responsible financially for providing a Sunday school for all Jewish
17:49
children who wished to attend, much the same as in our broader community
17:53
we have public schools and everybody pays for that, not just the parents.
17:58
This is unusual in that most Jewish communities it is considered that
18:03
the parents must pay for the Sunday school, and we feel the other way.
18:07
I see.
18:09
So Beit
18:13
Am was the name selected for this organization that was incorporated, of
18:21
which you became the first president.
18:23
What is the translation of Beit Am?
18:26
House of the people.
18:27
This was a name selected by Ze'ev Orzech, who is our expert on the Hebrew language.
18:36
The name itself is actually Beit Am Mid Willamette Jewish Community incorporated.
18:42
I guess it has Center incorporated.
18:43
Even early on we conceived of the idea that we wanted it to have a center,
18:49
even though we felt early on we couldn't necessarily afford to get one.
18:54
After the building was acquired, did religious services -- were
18:59
they held regularly?
19:03
Before we had acquired the building, we had started having weekly -- I
19:10
can't remember if it was weekly services or every other week -- but we were
19:13
having at least monthly services by then.
19:20
By then some of the m were in homes and some were at the Memorial Union.
19:25
But when we got the building, we started having services every week and
19:30
alternating between having a traditional, all in Hebrew, male minyan morning
19:37
service on Shabbat, Saturday mornings, with a Friday service in the evenings.
19:44
Sometimes there would be more services than that, but that was
19:47
sort of minimal from then on.
19:49
And we also decided to have a high holiday service.
19:55
I understand that a monthly newsletter began to be published which has continued
20:00
until the present day, by Beit Am that is.
20:03
To whom was it sent?
20:05
It was sent to all members of Hadassah automatically, all those who were
20:10
part of the Sunday school or Beit Am formally, and any other Jewish
20:16
community names that we -- and Hillel, any names that Hillel submitted.
20:22
And any additional Jewish community people that we could find.
20:30
It was thought that that was one of the ways of publishing our events and
20:34
encouraging people to take part in any one of the other organizations.
20:39
And we still do that.
20:40
Let's back up a little bit and talk about the dedication of this building, which
20:48
was the culmination of much much work..
20:52
The dedication itself?
20:57
Paula Krane had a great deal to do . . . there was actually a committee
21:00
of more than Paula, but Paula took a very active part in organizing that
21:05
event, and it was very well done.
21:07
It was conceived as
21:12
-- one of the things at that point, although we'd called ourselves a center and not
21:15
a synagogue up to that point, including getting the building, it was also realized
21:22
that a lot of the interest in having a building and getting funds for it might be
21:29
enhanced by emphasizing its synagogue function.
21:34
And we were able to -- actually Kurt Philipp borrowed a Torah at that time,
21:40
which he in fact had in his own home and we were having services in his own home.
21:46
So the dedication involved -- I believe we had a rabbi here, and we made it a
21:53
procession, carrying the Torah from the Philipps' home, which was fairly close,
21:59
within four or five blocks of Beit Am, I don't know the exact number of
22:04
blocks, and we had a formal procession of all our Jewish community walking
22:09
with the Torah to Beit Am, and carrying the Torah and having some appropriate
22:17
dedication things at that time.
22:20
From your description so far, it seems that Beit Am has been a
22:26
totally volunteer organization.
22:28
Is this true?
22:30
Not entirely.
22:31
Initially the Sunday school was entirely volunteer.
22:35
Any monies that were collected from, first the parents and later
22:38
Beit Am, went to buying books and supplies for the Sunday school.
22:44
However, in
22:48
the nearly 10 years between the formation of Beit Am and getting a
22:51
building, there came a period in which they decided that they would start
22:55
paying the teachers a nominal amount.
22:58
It's still not the normal amount that you would pay a professional
23:02
for the kind of work they do.
23:05
But they are paid nominally.
23:06
Then
23:09
the second thing was that a couple of years ago we had a part-time
23:13
rabbi, who of course was paid.
23:16
But other than that, all of the
23:20
activities of Beit Am are conducted by the members on a volunteer basis, unpaid.
23:29
How has having a home of its own affected Beit Am?
23:34
I think it's been an extremely important thing.
23:36
At the time we got the building, we had finally
23:45
made a transition to having the Sunday school at the Westminster
23:50
House, and mostly the services were at the Memorial Union.
23:54
In both cases, this was not really entirely satisfactory, particularly
23:59
around holiday time, particularly around Christmas, for instance, Westminster,
24:03
by being a Christian organization, although being very welcoming to us,
24:07
automatically had a Christmas tree up, and all sorts of things in the building.
24:12
Not only that but we had to
24:16
-- they let us do some storing -- early on I had to carry things in my
24:21
car from my home, boxes of things for each class, boxes of books.
24:26
We were allowed to store them there but it was still a matter of organizing the
24:30
rooms, of hauling chairs around, a big box of books to each teacher, and into rooms
24:37
that were not specifically for school.
24:41
And at the Memorial Union we began to run into problems where we were
24:45
in one room and right next door there might be a Jews for Jesus, well not
24:50
quite that bad but maybe one of the fundamentalist Christian groups singing
24:55
very loudly, with a lot more people than we were, their songs, as we were
24:58
singing ours, and it was very disturbing.
25:02
We needed a home where we did not have so much distraction.
25:11
Have there been any major changes in the nature and operation of
25:15
Beit Am since its early years, or rather since its incorporation?
25:20
Well of course one major change is in obtaining the building and
25:24
having its own building in 1982.
25:27
But I think another major change is one in which the community went from
25:32
thinking of itself as being a community center to being formally a synagogue,
25:37
although we have not changed our name.
25:40
This is historically very interesting, because when Sunday school started, and
25:44
this was the early days -- I think of the community starting with Hadassah
25:48
years ago -- the Sunday school people, there was a major argument, between,
25:56
basically it was two families, one in which they didn't want the name of God,
26:00
the word God, involved, and the other, the orthodox family, who felt that
26:04
it was very important with Judaism, that this was what being Jewish was.
26:11
And it was very interesting to try to keep this from splintering and keeping
26:16
both people involved in the Sunday school.
26:20
So in the early days of establishing Beit Am and the community
26:24
center, it was established
26:29
as wanting to house all of the activities of the Jewish community -- house and
26:36
sponsor fundraising, fundraising for Israel, in terms of the United Jewish
26:41
Appeal plus our local Beit Am needs, a Sunday school, a newsletter for everybody.
26:51
We don't sponsor the student activities at OSU but we encourage
26:55
them, they're part of Beit Am.
27:00
Philanthropic, religious -- we do all of the religious things.
27:03
But it turns out it was very -- once we had the building and the
27:10
monies were a little differently organized -- in other words, before
27:14
we got the building, the largest part of our funds was the fundraising
