Today’s date is March 15th, 2019, and I am Paige Sim.
00:06
This is an oral history interview with Mina Carson in Milam Hall 302E for the
00:12
OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern America Oral history Project.
00:17
Could you please state and spell your name?
00:20
Mina Carson, M-I-N-A C-A-R-S-O-N.
00:25
All right, so could you give a brief background of your childhood,
00:29
including things like when you were born, where you are from or grew up,
00:33
and what your family dynamic was?
00:35
Right.
00:37
I was born in San Francisco in 1953.
00:41
My dad was a medical resident at the time, so I believe that I was probably
00:47
conceived in Portland Oregon where he was an intern at… St. Vincent’s?
00:57
It – that’s probably wrong.
00:58
Anyway, at any rate, and then we – I, when I was two and a half and my sister was
01:07
about six months old, my parents decided to move to New England to set up a medical
01:12
practice with some of dad’s friends.
01:15
And so, we moved in ’55 – in the summer of ’55, I believe – to
01:22
Brunswick, Maine, and that’s where I grew up, is in Brunswick Maine.
01:29
My dad – you know, it was poss— [laughs] back in the day it was possible for
01:34
a family to have a, you know, have a pretty good life on one
01:42
doctor’s very modest income.
01:45
When we kids were in elementary school my mom took a job as a secretary at the
01:52
local college, which was Bowdoin College.
01:54
And so, we really – we initially lived in town, and later we moved to
01:59
a little old farmhouse out of town.
02:01
But we really grew up around the Bowdoin campus and knowing a lot of
02:06
professors and students and so on.
02:09
So, I was kind of immersed in that academic atmosphere as a kid.
02:15
We ended up to be… there was eventually three of us, three daughters.
02:20
My youngest sister was born in 1960.
02:25
So, that’s kind of a beginning there.
02:28
All right, so what was life like inside of your house?
02:33
It was, um, that’s a great question…
02:40
I would say – and I’ve talked a lot about my childhood with my sisters.
02:45
Both my parents have gone.
02:48
Dad died way back in ’95 and my mom died in ’07,
02:56
and so we’ve kind of been able to speculate a little bit
02:59
more freely on our childhood.
03:02
On the one hand, we had a fantastic childhood.
03:06
My parents, in particular, my mom was one of those moms who wanted to
03:11
have her kids have the advantages.
03:14
Again, back then the advantages did not cost an arm and a leg.
03:20
But we had, for example, a second house in Maine skiing country that
03:25
my parents bought as a shell of a farmhouse and my dad pretty much rebuilt
03:31
over several years on the inside.
03:34
It was rough and crude and absolutely wonderful, in the
03:38
middle of an apple orchard.
03:39
And then you could drive half an hour to Sugarloaf Mountain, which
03:42
was the outstanding skiing mountain in Maine and that was about two
03:46
hours from our house in Brunswick.
03:48
And so, we had that kind of thing.
03:50
We teased Mom and she allowed us to go to summer camp, you know,
03:54
when we were in middle school.
03:58
Um… we just – it was just a really comfortable – I had music lessons,
04:03
we played sports; it was a real small town growing up thing.
04:09
And in that town I would say, you know, we were upper-middle class.
04:14
It was very comfortable.
04:18
On the other hand, my parents had, I would say, an increasingly
04:22
fraught, tense relationship.
04:24
They stayed together until I believe until all three of us had left for college.
04:36
And again, I really should be clear about that.
04:38
Yeah, that’s true.
04:39
So, all three of us were out of the house and then they divorced.
04:45
So, we didn’t have a really good example of a… a genuinely loving relationship.
04:52
They cooperated with each other, they liked each other, they
04:56
liked to do the same things, and that was really important.
04:59
And so, by the time I was an adolescent, we had – and I went away to school;
05:05
that’s a whole other story – but when I would come home on the holidays
05:09
we had wonderful evenings sitting around the table playing poker and
05:14
laughing and just having a great time.
05:17
We’d have friends over.
05:19
So, all of that was really wonderful, really positive.
05:25
So, growing up in sort of a small town, was it a more conservative small town
05:30
or more open-minded [unintelligible]
05:32
? That’s a really good question.
05:34
My first hit on that is that it was a little more open-minded and liberal,
05:39
partly because it was a college town.
05:43
Probably largely because it was a college town.
05:45
We were surrounded by fishing villages, small agricultural
05:51
villages, a few touristy villages.
05:56
But again, we’re talking about the fifties and early sixties, so really
06:00
not overwhelmed with tourists, although, of course, we were close
06:05
to, you know, Kennebunkport and Mount Desert, and a lot of places that
06:12
did regularly attract tourists and summer residents, as well as skiers.
06:17
But I would say, given the college, we were probably a fairly liberal town.
06:25
And again, back then we had – Margaret Chase Smith was one of our state senators,
06:32
or a sena—a US senator from Maine.
06:34
She was Republican, but quite a moderate Republican.
06:38
Back then the Republican Party was different.
06:42
There weren’t the wildly confrontational divisions that you see today.
06:50
So, that’s a long answer to say more liberal.
06:55
I was brought fairly… in a fairly socially conservative way, but
07:04
again, we were really on the cusp of feminism and my mom wanted to do
07:12
the right thing by her daughters.
07:15
And so, she tried to get – you know, we… it was still the day when you had to wear,
07:21
you know, skirts and dresses to school.
07:23
I mean, there was no question.
07:25
Girls could not wear pants to school.
07:27
This is the era we’re dealing with.
07:29
Public school.
07:32
And so, you know, and Mom wanted us to, you know, go to parties and
07:36
wear the right shoes and so on.
07:39
And the older two of us were pretty tomboyish, very tomboyish,
07:46
and we hated that whole rigmarole of learning how to be girls.
07:49
And…
07:51
I think probably deep in her heart my mom wasn’t crazy about it either,
07:56
but she, again, she felt she had to do the right thing, the right thing.
08:01
So, in that way, it was relatively conservative.
08:05
And I still… still, and again, in that era – because I was… I was a young middle
08:14
schooler – was Kennedy was assassinated in ’63; I began high school in
08:21
’66, and so we’re still talking about… we’re still really talking
08:28
about the olden days, you know.
08:31
Yeah.
08:31
So, when – being in a – I mean you said it was more liberal, open-minded,
08:36
but at the same time still had those conservative things – so, when were you
08:40
first introduced to homosexuality, and was that something that was accepted in
08:45
your town or in your – within your family?
08:47
I think it probably…
08:52
the first answer is no.
08:53
No, no, no, and no.
08:57
There was [unintelligible] … I’ve been thinking hard about these
09:02
questions and putting them in this, my personal historical context, and
09:08
I think that we – I’ve wondered ever since we had – you know, my dad was in this
09:14
medical group, a bunch of young doctors, very heterosexual, you know, raising
09:20
young families, and again all of us kids were just a little bit… just a little bit
09:27
edgy, just a little bit non-conforming, just a little bit, you know.
09:34
And my parents, my parents had left… they grew up in Ohio, and I actually
09:40
still have relatives in Ohio whom I adore and who are quite, quite liberal,
09:43
but I think they felt pretty – and each from their own families, they
09:47
felt pretty oppressed there socially.
09:50
So, there was that edge to my family’s history, that that couple broke away.
09:56
First, they went to the west coast to do Dad’s, you know, he got his medical
10:01
education in Ohio but then they went to the west coast to – for residency,
10:04
internship and residency, and then way to the east coast to bring us up.
10:09
So, there was that edge.
10:12
They were always liberal, skeptical.
10:16
We watched the pathbreaking TV shows.
10:21
You know, regular Laugh-In, and all those really, um, I really want to say…
10:28
well… I’m missing my word right now, but anyway, they were television shows
10:35
that really attacked the status quo, and we loved those, we watched those.
10:39
But homosexuality, that was a whole different issue.
10:43
That was something that only came up, I believe, in conversation in
10:50
my family for the first time when I had my first crush on a girl.
10:57
And you know, and I did not say, oh—I did not come home and say, “Wow, I’ve
11:03
got a crush on a girl, isn’t this cool?” But my mom could see how important that
11:07
person was in my life and she freaked out.
11:10
She was really scared for me.
11:13
She said, “What are you”— I think she said, “What, are you a lesbian?”
11:18
And she – it was like it was the worst possible thing that she could ask me.
11:24
And of course, I didn’t respond.
11:26
Actually, I think I either said no or I didn’t respond.
11:30
So – oh, I know, the thing I was going to say was there was a – that
11:35
my parent’s friends had a friend named Jeremy [phonetic] . I can’t
11:41
remember his last name so I don't think I’m giving away any secrets.
11:44
I mean, these people are… mostly have left the earth.
11:47
And he was called a bachelor [laughs] . I’ve wondered off and on
11:53
ever since if Jeremy was a bachelor, a heterosexual bachelor, or the other
11:59
kind of bachelor we used to talk about.
12:01
I don't know.
12:02
I don't know, and if any of the people I grew up with see this,
12:05
they’re probably going to call me and up and say, “Are you kidding?
12:08
Come on” [laughs] , “He dated women all the time.” So I don't know,
12:13
but no, we didn’t talk about it.
12:15
We did not talk about it.
12:17
So, and you had your first crush on a woman.
12:21
What, like what kind of thoughts were you having then?
12:24
Were you thinking this is something that will just go away, it’s
12:27
just random, or was it deeper?
12:30
Yeah, it was really hard because I thought oh, this must be what real
12:34
friendship is like, when you feel so strongly about someone and you think
12:38
about them all the time and you want them to like you and you, you know,
12:42
and you’re really obsessed with them.
12:45
Oh, then I must be having good friends.
12:46
And you know, at the next layer I thought oh God, this is not so good.
12:51
You know, this is, this is something that I need to moderate.
12:54
This is something I need to hide.
12:56
So – and as I was… let’s see… I think 13, 14, 15, I went away to
13:07
school when I was 14, so 12 and 13 maybe I had my first crush.
13:14
It’s a classic, right?
13:17
School and summer camp.
13:20
I mean, sports teams and summer camp.
13:23
And
13:26
I really, again, tried to frame it to myself.
13:30
As a young adolescent I tried to frame it to myself as well, this
13:33
is, this is just – I just have these really intense friendships, you know.
13:38
And of course in a sense – and I know this as a historian,
13:41
that’s not completely wrong.
13:43
This is what – incorrect, I mean – this is what, you know, this
13:46
is what we read about in class.
13:48
This is what we, you know.
13:50
It was very common in the women’s colleges at the turn of the century
13:56
that people spoke openly and in amused ways about their own crushes.
14:02
They actually, they delivered flowers to each other, they – and so, in a sense,
14:06
there was a history for that that I probably was not completely aware of.
14:13
What I was aware of in terms of gender was that I was deeply uncomfortable
14:19
with the life that was being handed to me by my culture; that I was a
14:24
big reader, starting from whenever, starting from five or six, right?
14:31
And I wandered into a lot of literature and biographies of people who,
14:36
again, lived on the edge; artists and writers and nonconformists, and
14:40
I thought oh, these people are so interesting, they have such cool lives.
14:44
And I guess I’m going to be a secretary and study French, you know?
14:49
And so, it was like I just couldn’t quite put it together and it, it scared me.
14:54
I couldn’t look into the future with any kind of openness or
15:00
excitement and say the world is open to me because it didn’t seem to
15:05
me.
15:06
So, how long before you actually started to embrace that side of you and actually
15:16
start dating women, even if it wasn’t out?
15:18
Right.
15:19
Just for yourself.
15:20
Twenty years.
15:22
Twenty years.
15:22
Into my early thirties I finally came out to myself and – no, came out publicly.
15:32
And even then it wasn’t very public…
15:39
When I was…
15:44
probably in high school but possibly even in college…
15:50
I wrote – it was probably high school because it was a journal I think – and I
15:55
wrote… I think I wrote… anyway, I said to myself as long as nobody else ever knows
16:04
about these feelings that I have, I’ll be okay, as long as I never tell anybody.
16:12
So at that point, basically I consigned myself to a life of silence; to
16:18
a life of not telling anybody the most… the core things about myself,
16:27
about my feelings, about my need for affection, about my sexuality, I
16:32
mean that was just all off the table.
16:35
What c—like what made you decide that you could no longer stay
16:41
silent about who you really are?
16:44
Times changed.
16:45
That was really important.
16:47
That was really important.
16:48
I don't even think I was aware of Stonewall when it happened,
16:53
and I was an east coast person.
16:54
I mean, by that point I was in… well no, but at that point, I was
16:59
in – yeah, I was in prep school outside Boston when that happened.
17:04
I don't think I was aware of it, but when the marches started happening
17:08
that commemorated Stonewall; by college I think I was aware of those.
17:13
Certainly in graduate school, I was aware of that.
17:17
But meanwhile,
17:21
I had relationships with men.
17:25
I mean long-term relationships.
17:28
Long-term sexual relationships with men.
17:30
And so, I think at that – again, I think I spent a lot of energy lying to myself.
17:38
I really loved those guys, that was not a lie, but to have a life that
17:44
was marriage and children at that point, at that point to have that life
17:52
just seemed to me to be impossible.
17:56
Not what I wanted.
17:57
I wanted to be alone at that point.
17:59
I wanted to be alone.
18:01
If I – and I, I can say today that maybe I was thinking if I couldn’t
18:06
have what I wanted I definitely wanted to be alone, but I don't think
18:11
I ever said it to myself that way.
18:13
The other two factors were my younger sister came out.
18:18
I mean… and I thought wow [laughs] . I mean, I don't know what else to say.
18:25
I thought wow, God bless her!
18:28
You know?
18:28
And my best friend in graduate school came out and we had, we had – she
18:35
was – I just loved her so much.
18:38
She was brilliant, she was funny, and we had nightly conversations on the phone
18:45
about everything under the universe.
18:47
In the universe, under the sun, whatever.
18:49
And so, when she fell in love with another woman we talked about it like
18:55
every night, you know, at length.
18:59
It was so interesting and I thought all right, who am I
19:03
being in these conversations?
19:05
What am
19:07
I, what… am I really going to stick to that pledge that I made to myself?
19:13
Am I really going to do that?
19:17
At some point, um… at some point, probably in my twenties, and maybe earlier, I
19:26
pledged – you know, I’m not a – this is hilarious – I’m not a theist, I’m not
19:30
a believer, but every so often I’ve had a, you know, I’ve sort of chatted with
19:34
God and had a really good relationship with whoever I think God is, right?
19:38
And so, at one point I swore to God that I would never eat another lobster because
19:43
of the boiling them to death thing, right?
19:45
And so [laughs] , you know, I think well, what… was that the kind
19:53
of – was that the kind of, you know…
19:59
was I as loyal to my pledge never to tell anyone about my feelings as I’d
20:05
been to my pledge never to eat lobster?
20:07
I mean, you know, this was nuts.
20:09
And of course, the long-term answer is no.
20:12
But it has been so painful, and… um, that was a very painful process of coming out.
20:20
And I think that – extremely painful.
20:24
Although I have to say not as painful as many, if not the majority, of
20:30
coming out stories that I know and I’ve heard and I’ve read.
20:32
So…
20:35
But…
20:40
it was [sighs] … the irony was here I was, I was growing up on the east
20:47
coast, I went to school outside Boston, I went to college in Cambridge, I went
20:55
to graduate school in Cam—you know, all the – you know, the world was unfolding
20:59
in these pointy-hatted places in the east.
21:03
And then after graduate school, I had my first academic job in small-town Missouri.
21:09
That’s where I came out
21:15
[laughs] . It was so, so ironic.
21:18
That was where I had my first relationship with a woman, and it – by
21:23
having that relationship, I came out.
21:25
Now, was I an activist at that point?
21:27
I was activist about everything else [laughs] . I was a feminist, you
21:32
know, I was, you know, anti-racism, I mean every other thing you could be.
21:38
Was I an activist for – in LGBTQ stuff?
21:43
I don't think so.
21:44
I doubt it.
21:46
So, that’s a long way around saying I came out finally when I
21:50
had this relationship, you know.
21:52
So, the relationship is sort of what pushed you to finally just come out?
21:55
Yeah, it was, but on the other hand, I have to be honest, by then I was
21:59
looking for a relationship, you know.
22:01
And I found a really, really nice one.
22:04
Again, ironically in Missouri.
22:06
Yes [laughs] . How did you end up in Missouri?
22:09
When you’re an academic – and this is still true, if not even more true
22:14
now; it was true the whole time I was going through graduate school
22:16
and of course it was in – thus it was insane to go to graduate school – I’m
22:20
glad I did, no question – but it was, you know, practically speaking
22:24
insane; you go where you’re posted.
22:28
You know, it’s like the military because – I mean you know, it is and it isn’t.
22:32
Of course, you don’t have to go anywhere you don’t want to go, but if you want
22:34
a job you go where you’re posted.
22:36
And I ended up, luckily, in this small regional Missouri school.
22:42
It is now Truman State University.
22:44
It was, at that point, Northeast Missouri State University.
22:48
And they were in the process of trying to become Missouri’s small liberal art
22:56
– a small public liberal arts college.
22:58
And they achieved that, but one of the reasons that I was hired was
23:03
[laughs] was because I was from a,
23:08
you know, an Ivy League program and they wanted to build their Ivy League cred.
23:15
So, so that’s how I got that job.
23:17
But I – and – I shouldn’t but – and/but
23:23
my colleges were great.
23:25
They were real, they were compassionate, they were interesting, and
23:31
because it was a small university with a fairly small kind of liberal
23:36
arts component, I met and was close friends with people from
23:43
all of the different disciplines.
23:45
That – and that was really, that was really me.
23:49
I was close to people in English, in writing, in philosophy, in
23:53
Sociology and Anthropology and Political Science [laughs] . I
23:57
mean, we’re all in the same hallway.
23:58
It was wonderful.
24:01
So…
24:02
And how did you end up meeting the woman?
24:05
She was a college.
24:06
Um… she was a college, and I think…
24:13
and she was at the time single.
24:15
Um… and I liked her and was attracted to her, and I think – and this is
24:23
not the usual thing in my life – I think I made the first move.
24:28
Anyway, yeah, enough said about that.
24:31
But yeah, so that’s how we got together.
24:37
And we – she had an awesome looking little bungalow and we actually… this was,
24:47
this was interesting, and for me really a great illustration of how difficult
24:53
my whole coming out process has been, and in some ways still remains; we had
24:59
a contractor come and really literally build a second floor onto the house so
25:05
that we had enough room so that both of us had studies, and I had a darkroom.
25:13
So, and he did a beautiful renovation, but I just felt – and you know, he
25:18
was always extremely professional, but I always felt so embarrassed that
25:26
it was obvious that we were a couple and that we were moving in together.
25:31
And I just… you know?
25:34
It – I never got over that.
25:36
Never… in some ways haven’t gotten over that.
25:41
So, I attribute my extreme awkwardness about my own sexuality to the time I
25:48
grew up in, and also whatever, you know, whatever personality lands inside us.
25:57
I mean, I talk a good game but I’m… really cautious in many ways,
26:04
really scared of not fitting in.
26:08
And I don't fit in, and so it’s… that makes for slightly awkward, edgy life
26:18
[chuckles]
26:18
. And so, you said you guys moved into together, so that relationship lasted…
26:23
It lasted until we got out here and…
26:30
and my then partner was very generous in agreeing to allow me to look for a job.
26:37
She was an academic, and a very successful one, and she had wanted to
26:41
move into a related field, and so she took that opportunity to kind of move
26:46
a little bit sideways at that point.
26:50
But the transition was, for both of us, was very, very difficult,
26:56
and the relationship kind of crumbled under the weight of that.
27:01
So, that’s how you ended up here in Corvallis?
27:03
Yeah, we ended up here in Corvallis and… yeah, because I got hired
27:09
here at OSU, which is [laughs] one of the very best things that’s
27:14
ever happened to me in my life.
27:17
It’s been a really good fit.
27:19
How does the Corvallis community, the LGBTQ+ community specifically,
27:25
compare to ones before you got here?
27:29
I never had one before I got here.
27:31
The one in my small town in Missouri was we had a good group
27:37
of – we had a good group friends, an extraordinary group of friends.
27:42
And we had a… a really good time together.
27:47
Um…
27:50
but it wasn’t – and it was, just as my friend groups have been out
27:55
here – it was very kind of mixed.
27:57
You know, gay, straight, you know, allies, questioning, whatever.
28:04
And so, I really have never – until I was out here, I never had had a queer
28:11
community, or been in a queer community.
28:14
And even out here, what it took – I came in 1989 – and
28:22
what it took…
28:27
was – I’m trying to think – no, I was involved with the local…
28:32
I was involved with the local organization before, I believe…
28:40
maybe slightly before the ballot measures of the nineties.
28:44
After 8 was formed, after Measure 8 which…
28:53
put on the ballot – Neil Goldschmidt, Governor Neil Goldschmidt had issued
28:57
an executive order against – or saying that you could not – that
29:05
hiring in the executive branch of the Oregon government could not…
29:11
you could not, not hire people because of, you know, race or sexuality, and
29:17
he added the sexuality to, or sexual orientation, to that regulation.
29:24
And the, I believe it was the Oregon Citizens Alliance already, put that
29:29
on the ballot in ’88 and it passed.
29:33
I mean the – I’m sorry – who put rescinding that on the
29:36
ballot, and rescinding it passed.
29:37
So, Oregon voters rescinded the executive order.
29:41
And
29:43
after 8 – and that was right before I got out here – and after 8 was an LGBTQ group
29:52
that met and started doing working literally to change the dialogue in Linn
29:59
and Benton counties to… to publicize the lives of gay and lesbian people;
30:09
to lobby locally and at the county and state levels for measures that protected
30:17
people basis of their sexuality.
30:21
The group started having – and this was, this was an amazing institution
30:26
– started having the Harvey Milk dinner annually, I believe in the spring.
30:33
We had a local celebration.
30:37
We hired one of the local churches that, um, I think it was… In the latter
30:43
years, it was the Congregational Church out just, just out of town on Western.
30:51
But I’m not sure if it started – if it began somewhere else.
30:55
I can’t remember.
30:56
But we would give awards to people who had either locally or nationally done
31:02
important things for the LGBTQ community.
31:05
So for example, we gave an award to Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon
31:11
from the San Francisco area.
31:13
We – it [laughs] , it was a wonderful thing, and it was a wonderful
31:19
thing because it built, and then built on, the political and social
31:24
alliances that were formed around fighting the OCA’s ballot measures.
31:28
And they came in, you know [laughs] , in rapid succession in the 1990s.
31:35
So… that was a – it built community…
31:42
Again, socially…
31:47
there was one brief shining moment when I was – I sort of had a group of, you know,
31:51
lesbian friends, a small group of lesbian friends, and we did everything together.
31:55
And then another group of lesbian friends who have been – we’ve
31:59
been tight for… 20 years?
32:03
Longer than 20 years, probably.
32:06
But our friendships have always spilled into the – they’ve always been…
32:13
we’ve been fr—we don’t have a sexuality test for [laughs] for our groups of
32:19
friends [laughs] . So [stumbles] , so the community has been, for me, more
32:24
of a – there have been people in it that I’ve been really tight with – and
32:29
I think that’s true for most people – people in the community that I’ve
32:31
been really tight with socially, and then just an awareness; an awareness
32:37
that we have each other’s backs.
32:39
I think that’s it.
32:40
But again, in this community…
32:45
it’s been,
32:48
it’s been… allies.
32:50
It’s been a… it’s been a marvelous place to live and to work.
32:58
So, you came here in ’89, you said?
33:00
Yeah.
33:00
And that was right at the beginning of all these ballot measures coming about.
33:04
Ballot measures, yeah.
33:06
So, it sounds like too, like the communities were really
33:09
starting to form at that point.
33:11
You kind of came in right at the beginning of that and—
33:13
Yes.
33:14
—had a chance to either be a part of it or at least some way connected to it.
33:17
Yeah, yeah.
33:20
So, how would you say the community has evolved?
33:25
It’s been 30 years now since you came here—
33:26
Right.
33:28
Right.
33:28
—so what was it, or how is it different today than it was right at that beginning?
33:33
Better or worse?
33:34
Again, you know, you’d think that that was a really straightforward
33:37
question to answer, but it’s not.
33:40
It’s a great question and I’m not sure I can… offer [laughs] a succinct answer.
33:49
I can ramble through an answer, and it’s an important question…
33:56
You know, I go back to something that
34:00
we discussed in class about the fading of the bar scene.
34:05
Of course, there was, there was never really a bar in Corvallis.
34:08
There was a coffee shop for a while called M’s [phonetic] , and that was
34:11
really important to the community.
34:12
Really important.
34:16
But it’s like the history of the community here is kind of like the history of
34:21
the bar scene in elsewhere in that…
34:27
there really – there may be a community on campus with younger people that I’m
34:32
not aware of, but among people in my generation and sort of close, you know,
34:39
close to my generation, I’m not sure that there really is a community, per se.
34:48
There are friendships, alliances, awarenesses.
34:52
I, I’m aware of
34:59
people who’ve been here a long time who are gay and lesbian and trans.
35:07
The church that I go to, Unitarian Universalist Church, has been
35:10
a really important place.
35:13
There are a number of local churches actually that have been really important
35:18
[laughs] points of light, shall we say, in fighting measures, and coming together
35:24
around supporting trans people most [stumbles] , most recently, and making
35:33
a safe space culturally, spiritually, emotionally, for gay and lesbian people.
35:39
So, I don't want to say there’s no community in that sense.
35:43
My experience – and this is a human community like anywhere else, so there
35:46
have been bad experiences for individuals in this community – my experience is
35:53
among, let me say among the predominantly white gay and lesbian people who live
36:03
here, by and large, it’s been a pretty comfortable place
36:06
to live, relatively speaking.
36:08
Now, for people of color, I cannot speak to that experience but I
36:12
know that it is not comfortable.
36:15
I mean, I raised a couple of kids of color, and even then I feel that – and
36:24
they’ve been pretty open with me about their experience here – and even then
36:28
I feel that I can’t speak for the experiences of people of color in the,
36:34
you know, in the Corvallis community.
36:35
God knows I’m an ally but I – it would be wrong of me to
36:39
speak for their experiences.
36:42
How do you think Oregon State, specifically, has embraced the community?
36:47
Do you think it’s gotten better over time, or…?
36:51
I think it’s been exceptionally good.
36:53
And again, some people who may view this will say “Are you kidding?
36:58
You don’t know about this experience I had!” And in fact, we’ve had, in
37:02
the 30 years I’ve been here, we’ve had some pretty hair-raising experiences.
37:06
The gay and lesbian student group used to have – it’s changed its name
37:09
over a, you know, a number of times, and so I can’t remember what we were
37:12
called at the time – but the student group had a series of years where they
37:19
had a sleep-in on the quad, and two times at least they’ve been attacked.
37:25
I mean literally attacked.
37:26
Once, someone shot a gun over the tent.
37:32
Literally, they shot a gun over the tent.
37:36
And another time I believe the tent was pulled down.
37:39
So, there have been threats, but again – and I’m not mitigating those threats;
37:45
it was horrifying – but this is a [stumbles] , this is a human community
37:49
and there’s going to be bad guys here.
37:51
The institution itself has done really well for a kind of middle of the road
37:58
state institution through all those years, under the leadership of – under
38:04
the administrators and leadership and with faculty support, of course
38:09
[laughs] , has done a really good job at…
38:14
I believe, and again, you know, you’re hearing this from a middle of the road
38:18
kind of cautious person, I think OSU has done a really good job at listening.
38:25
At listening, at changing as the various communities, the various minority
38:32
communities, and communities under fire have spoken up and said, you know, this
38:40
isn’t working for us, or we need this.
38:43
The cultural centers have been an institutional response.
38:47
Administrative offices, administrative appointments have been an
38:53
institutional response.
38:55
The WGSS, the growth of Women’s Studies to embrace Sexuality Studies has been,
39:02
[stumbles] has been an administration response sparked by faculty and students.
39:08
But in other words, it’s been – and I, even through the horrific ballot measure
39:16
periods when, you know, if they had passed they would have put some of us
39:21
at risk because it talked about public schools and public education – we are
39:24
nothing if not a public school – put a number of us at risk of not being
39:29
able to teach our courses, and possibly being in jeopardy of our jobs.
39:34
And there was never, ever a sense that “well, God, we’re really sorry, but you
39:41
know, if this passes, lie” [laughs] . You know, there was never a sense of that.
39:46
So again, I’m sure that some people viewing this will see me as a
39:50
Pollyanna, and okay, but given the position of the school in the state,
39:59
and dependent on state funding, given our constituents, you know…
40:07
the university has done I think a really good job.
40:13
Okay.
40:13
You mentioned M’s, the coffee shop.
40:15
Oh, yeah.
40:16
Has – have there been any places like that on campus, like gathering
40:20
places, that you’re aware of?
40:22
Not that I’m aware of.
40:23
Oh, how embarrassing.
40:24
There probably are.
40:26
They’re probably a lot of secret notes.
40:27
It’s like when I talk about the community, you know, there’s probably
40:30
like people saying, “Well, don’t tell Mina about the community.” I mean [laughs]
40:37
, so I don't know.
40:40
I don't have an answer.
40:43
What about like Prism?
40:46
We were – when we were looking through the archives I found that
40:49
one Prism that was specifically—
40:50
Oh, right.
40:50
Have there been any magazines or any forms of communication that—
40:55
Right, like—
40:56
—that are LGBTQ?
40:57
What do you call the little, the little magazines?
41:00
Right.
41:01
Um…
41:06
I don't know…
41:10
I don't know.
41:12
The gay and lesbian, or LGBTQ student groups, have, you know, like any
41:21
student group, have kind of had this kind of – and there have been years
41:25
when they’ve been really active.
41:28
Forming the Pride Center and having that as a gathering place I think
41:31
has been incredibly important.
41:34
So yeah, I’m so—so yeah, there’s no place on campus except the Pride
41:37
Center [both laugh] , a whole house dedicated to the queer community.
41:41
But other than that, there’s no places that are… oh well.
41:46
Yeah, that’s been really important.
41:48
How are things overall, not just specifically Corvallis?
41:55
How are things different today for homosexuality than like
42:00
when you first learned of it?
42:02
Like… I’d be tempted to say 180 degrees except for the reactionary
42:09
political climate that we’re living in, and of course, I could go on
42:13
and on in the abstract and, and pointlessly about how, you know,
42:18
reaction breeds – you know, success breeds reaction and so on and so forth.
42:24
Like when Ellen came out, you know, it gave lots of people tremendous liberation,
42:31
and then her show was shut down.
42:32
So you know, things – that’s how it goes.
42:38
But boy, it’s different.
42:40
I mean…
42:45
I’d love to say that I hope I wouldn’t have been so chickenshit if I were,
42:51
uh, if I were coming out today with the family I had because again, the students
42:57
I speak with and the young people I speak with who do not come out, often
43:02
it’s because they’re terrified that they’re going to lose their families.
43:06
Sorry [voice breaking] , that they’re going to lose their families, and
43:10
I didn’t, my sister didn’t, you know, my parents struggled with our
43:15
identity, especially two, you know, two kids in the same family, oh my god.
43:21
Like my, one of my – my first partner once asked my mom, “Well, Helen, what’s
43:28
it like to have two gay daughters?” And my mom just sort of said, “Well, it’s the
43:36
sheer numbers.” [Laughs] I have no idea what she meant by that but it’s something
43:40
that has come down in the family.
43:42
There’s – we just love that response, “Well, it’s the sheer
43:46
numbers,” and dot, dot, dot.
43:48
I have no idea what she meant.
43:50
But she became a really, really staunch ally and activist.
43:54
And so, you know, my family evolved, and yet I look at young people and think,
44:02
you know, the world has sort of evolved, but there are still many families
44:07
in the United States and elsewhere
44:11
who revile queerness, who are terrified – I mean, there’s a whole spectrum, right?
44:17
They revile queerness maybe, their religion tells them it’s wrong, they
44:23
fear for their children, and that, that in some ways is the most heartbreaking,
44:29
but also the most corrigible.
44:32
You know, I mean they fear for their kids and then they think
44:36
okay, but my kid wants to be happy.
44:39
My kid deserves to be happy.
44:40
So, it’s this whole range but it’s just, it’s still not easy to
44:44
come out, and things have changed so much, but it’s just not easy.
44:50
So,
44:53
how have major events surrounded the LGBTQ+ community affected you personally?
45:00
The – I’ve already talked about the nineties and the ballot measures, and
45:03
those really, they really did affect me.
45:06
In fact, one of the things I did, and in some ways I have – I have some
45:11
regrets – is I got together with another partner and I was living, at that point,
45:17
really downtown, and I put a campaign poster on my lawn and it got torn down.
45:25
I mean, that’s all that happened, is it just got torn down, and I thought wooo.
45:30
And at that point, we had the opportunity to move to a
45:34
hillside just outside of town.
45:37
We did that, and it was partly – I think my reasoning was partly
45:41
that this is too scary for me.
45:44
It wasn’t, nothing else happened, but in other words, there was that buzz of fear.
45:50
There was that, you know, you almost wished you could go back into the closet.
45:54
You almost wished – I, you know, I shouldn’t say you – the other people
45:58
like came out, stayed out, you know.
46:02
I did the marches, I did the demonstrations, you
46:07
know, I stayed with After 8,
46:10
and yet I always felt… apologetic about who I was.
46:17
I mean, that’s – I’m just interjecting something I missed of that, of that
46:22
answer that might whole life has really pretty much been marked by
46:27
feeling apologetic about who I am.
46:30
So you know, if I’m given another 20, 25 years on this earth, knock on wood,
46:38
it’s one of the things I’d really like to get past.
46:41
But how have things affected me?
46:43
When I was in graduate school and I was – I mean, here’s another example:
46:48
I was in New York City doing research for my dissertation, a beautiful summer
46:54
in New York City, I mean it was just such a gift – because I’m a city kid, I
46:58
mean at heart – I was walking around one day and stumbled upon the pride parade.
47:08
[Laughs] it was so cool.
47:09
I just stumbled upon it.
47:11
And I stood on the sidelines and took pictures of the participants
47:15
and cheered and yelled.
47:17
And again, remember this is back in graduate school.
47:20
I had not come out, and I just thought… when, when am I going to do this?
47:28
When am I going to do this?
47:29
And then I let it go again.
47:31
I let it go again.
47:31
I was – at that point, I was involved with another man and, um, you know, I
47:40
guess the best I could say about myself was oh, I must be – maybe I’m bisexual.
47:44
I mean, I don't know, maybe I’m bisexual, you know.
47:45
Maybe these feelings…
47:47
But, so that was an example of a time when I ran smackdab into one of the
47:53
signs of LGBTQ activism and I said oh, I’ll just take a few pictures
47:58
of you guys, and good for you.
48:00
You stay out there.
48:01
And then AIDS, AIDS, I was in Missouri when I really became super aware of
48:07
the AIDS pandemic, and… and I think my response to it was horror that all of
48:19
these men were dying; that men who – my generation of men, who were talented
48:27
and – [laughs] or not talented – who were my age, I was in my early thirties,
48:33
and they were, they were dying.
48:35
They had so much time left on this earth and they were dying.
48:39
But as a lesbian… I… as a lesbian, I… didn’t personally connect or feel at risk.
48:53
And I’m telling the truth here, and that may be – that may sound horrifying,
48:59
but it wasn’t like “Oh, thank God it’s not me,” except in the way that we are
49:04
always “Thank God it’s not me,” you know.
49:09
So – but I was hyper-aware of AIDS, hyper-aware of AIDS, and I think it was
49:16
more generational almost than, than… related to sexual orientation, I think.
49:24
And again, that’s the early years when I was in Missouri and I… I’m not aware
49:31
of knowing anyone there who had AIDS, but you know, we didn’t always know.
49:39
So, that’s more past More current things, like the current presidential
49:44
administration, what effect has that had on you, and have you felt more inclined
49:50
to get involved with the community and/or current political movements and things?
49:53
Yeah.
49:54
It’s had a huge effect on me, like most other people.
50:00
And that goes… a large part of that is as a historian because
50:08
I am so appalled and frightened at what’s happening in the United States.
50:15
I am, again, to use that word, I’m hyper-aware of the ways in which climate
50:22
change is an – is already affecting and exacerbating inequality around
50:30
the world, and how it will do so.
50:32
I mean, we are looking at – we’ve already experienced, even in this country,
50:38
disasters we… we have never experienced before, and in their – not just their
50:44
scope, but in their frequency, and we’re doing almost nothing to mitigate that.
50:51
And so, I fear for our constitution.
50:55
I fear for our future because even moderate people, even people who are
50:59
not wildly like – you know, Trump’s is a terrorist administration, basically,
51:05
but even people who are not… you know, in that camp, who are more moderate and
51:11
say, “Oh, maybe some of the things he’s doing are not so good,” are not onboard
51:18
entirely; are not – if they understand, then they are not doing everything they
51:24
can to say you know what, this is first.
51:28
People are ridiculing the Green New Deal.
51:30
The Green New Deal is actually brilliant.
51:33
It’s actually brilliant.
51:35
So, in terms of [laughs] , in terms of issues involving queer people,
51:39
well, of course, we’re all human, so we’re all going to be, you know,
51:41
either burned up or flooded out,
51:45
but yes, I’m appalled at the backwards movement.
51:49
I’m appalled at the administration.
51:52
[Sighs] again, I’m probably going to enrage a lot of people, but that, to
51:57
me, is not the most scary thing because that’s going to get backpedaled.
52:04
That is not going to stand.
52:07
And where we are in this culture, where we are in this society, this world, the
52:12
stuff that the – the things that the administration has, you know, offended
52:17
trans and queer people with, the real – I mean, the… the real losses and threats
52:23
to individuals, I don’t, I don't diminish those, but the idea that policy will
52:29
be passed that will, that will turn the clock back in a significant way for queer
52:36
people without its being turned around, I’m just not that worried about that.
52:41
I am worried about women.
52:42
I’m worried about abortion rights, I’m worried – I’m very
52:48
worried about Roe v. Wade.
52:49
I’m worried about the deep corruption that’s entered the Supreme Court.
52:52
So, all of that stuff [sighs] , so maybe it sounds like I’m whistling
52:58
in the wind, but – and it’s not that the – the least of these is queer
53:03
stuff, it’s just that I just think that’s going to get backpedaled.
53:09
And maybe I’m Pollyanna, but…
53:15
What movements or marches or protests have you been a part of or
53:19
want to maybe be a part of in the future in regards to those issues?
53:23
Yeah, all of the above [laughs]
53:27
. And I’m not a good – I’m not a good – I contribute the way I can.
53:31
When I have money, I contribute financially.
53:35
I contribute with my photography; I try to help publicize what’s going on locally.
53:41
I am not a good phone caller.
53:44
I am not a good – those are things that I fail at because again, my shyness, my
53:50
embarrassment, my inability to sort of get in someone’s face and say, “Are you
53:55
going to do this?” and that makes me a bit of a weakling in terms of participating
54:02
in, you know, in events in movements.
54:10
But to be in a march, that’s fun.
54:13
To take pictures and publicize them, that’s fun.
54:15
So, that’s kind of where I’m at.
54:19
Have there been any personal major life events that have really shaped you?
54:24
Like any moments in time that just have made you like stop and rethink, or just
54:29
think about things a different way?
54:31
That’s such a great question.
54:32
Um…
54:41
oh boy.
54:42
Um…
54:46
here I sit silently while the tape is running [laughs] . Oh
54:50
gee, major life events,
54:54
I think… I think not – having my children.
54:58
Having my children; adopting my children.
55:00
I mean, that… that’s the biggest.
55:03
That’s the – that’s the, the biggest.
55:07
I mean, I had a – when I – back away from that for a sec – I had a medical
55:10
crisis when I was 20 and practically died, and I think just the consciousness
55:17
of that, the consciousness of how lucky I was is always with me, and it makes
55:26
me cautious about, you know, about, oh, things that happen in my body.
55:31
Hmm, I better pay attention to that.
55:33
But that was a huge life event.
55:37
I think my parents divorcing, even though I was in my thirties by then,
55:42
I think it was, it was confronting the difficulties in their marriage, and
55:50
the courage that it took one of them to say, mm, that’s it.
55:59
But [stumbles] , but the kids – and I say that – I’m not dissing my exes
56:04
and how important our relationships were – but having the kids, wow.
56:11
And you adopted them; what was that process like?
56:13
That was really—
56:14
Especially as a gay couple?
56:15
Yeah, that was really challenging.
56:17
I was partnered at the time, and initially, I tried to get pregnant with,
56:26
you know, AI, artificial insemination, and I was by then in my early forties.
56:32
And it could have worked and didn’t, and I’m just glad because now I have my kids
56:42
[laughs] . But I want – but I really – I think this is an important – it’s
56:46
important to put that in the record.
56:48
And so, we decided
56:53
to work with an agency that would…
56:58
whose process would allow us to adopt with minimal legal challenges.
57:04
We were going to be an intact family, but the reality was – and
57:09
this is the difficulty is being queer – you know, the reality was
57:14
that it was going to be difficult; that we were going to have to do some
57:18
misrepresenting of our family situation.
57:23
And we worked with an a—now, I’m not going to name the agency.
57:27
It was a good agency but that would not be fair.
57:31
We worked with an agency that let us do a home study.
57:34
I went forward as the adoptive parent, and
57:38
we were able to adopt in Vietnam.
57:41
And I probably said enough, I mean as much about that process as I should
57:45
because this has been a really, really fraught issue, this issue of
57:53
gay people adopting internationally.
57:57
And of course, it makes me furious that it’s that kind of issue, but it is.
58:06
My then-partner and I both – and so, so one child was adopted as a tiny,
58:14
tiny infant from Vietnam, and the second child was adopted domestically.
58:19
And that was in some ways an easier process.
58:22
It was a private adoption.
58:25
But adoption is always – it’s always incredible joyful and incredibly scary
58:30
because [laughs] , you know, biological parents don’t go through – they go through
58:36
their own hell in terms of the process, you know, in being scared and – but they
58:41
don’t go through these tests that you have to pass to be allowed to be a parent!
58:46
So, both of us adopted each child.
58:49
And so, in Oregon, you could do that, in various counties.
58:53
It may be statewide now.
58:55
I’m afraid I don't know.
58:57
But we went through an attorney who helped us find a county where it was
59:03
– it’s completely legal, these are not fake papers – so, both children are
59:07
both of our children, and I love that.
59:11
It’s so important.
59:14
How long did it take from like the beginning of the adoption process?
59:18
The process?
59:18
Until you actually had your children?
59:19
Probably a year.
59:21
It may have been – and that’s classic, actually.
59:24
It may have been a little more than a year.
59:26
I’m blocking out because it was so… it was so exciting and so scary, and
59:32
when are we going to get our referral, when are we going to get a referral.
59:35
That
59:37
was the first child, and oh my god [laughs] what a joy.
59:42
What a joy.
59:43
The second child, it was much faster because it was domestic
59:47
adoption, and so we didn’t wait.
59:50
We, we…
59:54
got to know of this child and we wanted to adopt him, and so we didn’t have to like
1:00:02
go through this big waiting process where we wait for a child to be referred to us.
1:00:05
So, that was… that was a lot shorter.
1:00:09
[Unintelligible] that was an exciting process at the same time it was difficult.
1:00:13
So, have you handled negative things in your life?
1:00:16
Like what kind of coping mechanisms?
1:00:18
[Laughs] denial, denial, and denial [laughs] ! Um, I swear a lot, I’m very
1:00:28
immature in terms of if anything goes wrong, you know, with my computer or,
1:00:34
you know, or with anything in my life, I stomp around and I get very childish.
1:00:40
I’m pretty good with other people, so I don't always do that in public, but…
1:00:46
and I’m lucky, lucky, lucky enough not to have a depressive bone in my body,
1:00:53
in terms of – I get, I get anxious, I get angry, I get pessimistic, but
1:01:02
I can usually throw it off either through denial or through distraction…
1:01:07
I’m
1:01:11
thinking of the major stuff that I’ve faced, that we’ve faced.
1:01:16
You know, breakups are hard.
1:01:19
When your kids are hurting, there is almost nothing worse in the entire
1:01:26
world than when your kids are having a hard time, and that, that takes me
1:01:31
right back into my least mature self.
1:01:37
It’s one of the ways in which parenting can humble you.
1:01:39
I mean, one of the ways in which parenting can humble you is when your kids tell
1:01:42
you you’ve got everything all wrong.
1:01:44
You know, and all kids do that.
1:01:46
But the other way is when you’re not quite sure.
1:01:49
You want to make everything better for your kid, and you can’t, and you have to
1:01:52
tell yourself this is the child’s life.
1:01:56
This is their learning process, not yours.
1:02:00
Not yours to fix.
1:02:02
So, that’s – those are some times when I just get really… I don't
1:02:09
handle things well, shall we say.
1:02:13
When we were doing the pre-interview stuff, you mentioned music.
1:02:16
How have you used music as maybe a coping mechanism, or just—?
1:02:18
Yeah.
1:02:19
Oh my gosh, hugely.
1:02:22
And I’m not – I’m really a hobbyist musician.
1:02:26
I’m not a great musician.
1:02:28
I never have had the discipline to take my skills to the level that I would like
1:02:35
them to be at, but apparently not well enough to practice three hours a day.
1:02:38
But I’m a songwriter.
1:02:40
My mom – and this is one of the incredible gifts she gave me – she figured I took
1:02:45
piano lessons, that didn’t take, you know, I was a kid, and then when I was in sixth
1:02:51
grade she became aware that one of our friend’s sons was taking guitar lessons
1:02:56
and was getting pretty good on guitar, and she said, “Would you be interested in
1:03:01
learning at guitar?” And I said, “Sure,” and we went and watched him play and, you
1:03:06
know, we talked with the guitar teacher.
1:03:07
And you know, my mom just said – she didn’t want us to play band or orchestra
1:03:11
instruments, and that probably was a mistake, but she wanted us to have
1:03:16
something that we could do on our own.
1:03:18
And she knew I loved signing because I’d been playing ukulele and stuff like that.
1:03:23
And this was back before the uke was really big, right?
1:03:27
Like ’63 or four or something.
1:03:30
And so, she got me a guitar and a teacher, and wow.
1:03:36
I mean, that was great.
1:03:38
So, I just sang and sang and sang and sang and sang.
1:03:41
I became, you know, this is like ’64, ’65, ’66, ’67, so I became
1:03:48
one of the ones who always – you know, I took my guitar to camp.
1:03:51
It was a, you know, it was the campfire stuff.
1:03:55
I had a little group.
1:03:57
We went around and sang at events and like old people’s homes, as
1:04:01
they called them at the time.
1:04:04
And… it was important.
1:04:07
So, as an emotional release, it meant everything to me.
1:04:12
And then when I got to prep school I started… I started writing songs.
1:04:17
I just out of the blue at 14, 15, 16 years old, I started writing songs.
1:04:23
And I was no prolific.
1:04:25
Let me say, I was not prolific.
1:04:27
And that side of me that was really kind of emotional and, you know,
1:04:34
and oh God, the world, da da da, um, is a great and a terrible place and
1:04:40
a – and I was also an intellectual, and after I got out of high school – I
1:04:45
mean, I was a big troublemaker in high school – and I took a year off before
1:04:48
I went to college, and when I went to college I got into my intellectual side.
1:04:52
The intellectual side was very, very reserved and focused on studying
1:04:58
and reading and not having any of these relationship things going on.
1:05:02
So I would – I was playing classical guitar but I stopped writing for a
1:05:06
while, and then when I got into graduate school and I was trying to finish my
1:05:11
dissertation I taught myself guitar again because you do anything to avoid
1:05:16
finishing your dissertation [laughs] . So watch out when you go to graduate school.
1:05:21
Watch out for those little hobbies that creep in.
1:05:25
So, I taught myself photography and I taught myself guitar.
1:05:28
I mean, it wasn’t all lost, and I did finish the dissertation, but – but then–
1:05:32
Anyway, so…
1:05:36
when I got to Missouri I played a little bit, you know, five years in Missouri?
1:05:42
Five years in Missouri?
1:05:45
Yes, five years in Missouri.
1:05:47
And when I moved out here and went through some relationship emotional
1:05:52
stuff I started writing again.
1:05:53
And at that point my writing became political.
1:05:58
And so, some of the writing was about relationships, some of the writing
1:06:02
was about political stuff, but that’s when I was able, finally, to say okay,
1:06:09
I can bring all of myself together.
1:06:12
You know, the political stuff, the intellectual stuff, the musical stuff, the
1:06:15
emotional stuff, and write these songs.
1:06:21
So again, boy, it takes me… now it takes me a very long time to finish a song.
1:06:29
I’ve gone back into my self-critical place and it’s like…
1:06:34
But I’m still kind of eking them out, eking them out.
1:06:38
I started writing other stuff because for some reason it seems easier to do that.
1:06:42
But…
1:06:45
and I started playing fiddle.
1:06:46
When my son was six months old – and so this was crazy, it was
1:06:51
absolutely crazy – my son was six months old, my daughter was two;
1:06:57
I just, I had this vision one night that well, I should be playing the
1:07:01
violin because, um, because I have pretty good tone recognition [laughs]
1:07:08
. So I’ve been – I had to – I taught myself the fiddle and I got involved with some
1:07:13
people in town who play Irish fiddle.
1:07:15
You know, Celtic they were, really; Irish, Scottish, you know, all those.
1:07:20
And that has become one of my core social groups and social experiences.
1:07:26
I’m out playing fiddle four times a week now, basically.
1:07:31
So, it’s been really important.
1:07:36
I mean, I still beat myself up all the time because my skill
1:07:38
level isn’t what it should be, but anyway, that’s beside the point.
1:07:42
But, so the songwriting, I mean the songwriting was my way of,
1:07:46
you know, kind of pulling these various pieces of myself together.
1:07:51
And you mentioned photography as well.
1:07:53
Was that sort of the same thing, or more of just a hobby?
1:07:56
Yeah, that… [Stumbles] that’s a different piece of myself.
1:08:01
That’s right, and a lot of that came from my dad.
1:08:03
My dad was a real gadget guy.
1:08:05
I’m more temperamentally like my mom, but my dad has had a huge
1:08:09
effect on my life, and he loved, he loved doing little technical things.
1:08:14
He loved – and so, he took up photography.
1:08:17
And he’d buy these cameras and I kind of got the bug from him.
1:08:20
And we shared cameras and we chatted, you know, we read the – that – there
1:08:24
was no internet then so we read the magazines and we, you know,
1:08:27
learned all this stuff and so on.
1:08:29
And so, off and on I did photography.
1:08:32
And as I say, when I was I think a year and a half from completing
1:08:36
my dissertation, I was working in an undergraduate house at
1:08:40
Harvard and they – there was an unused darkroom in the basement.
1:08:44
And so, I got a key to it and taught myself, literally fitted out the
1:08:48
darkroom, which wasn’t all that expensive to do, and taught myself
1:08:54
to develop and print pictures.
1:08:56
I mean, I’m astonished now that I actually did that [laughs] . I mean, whoa.
1:09:00
And then – so that, that – so, when I went to Missouri I used the university
1:09:06
darkroom for a while, and then when I moved in with my partner and I
1:09:10
had a, my own personal darkroom.
1:09:14
And so, then, that was… what changed everything.
1:09:18
And then it kind of went on a little, into a little valley because I didn’t have
1:09:24
the time or really the money to continue doing photography the way I wanted to
1:09:28
while I was working here and so on.
1:09:30
And then digital came along, and when digital became viable, I got
1:09:36
back into photography big time.
1:09:38
And so, I’ve done that since… oh, I don't know, ’04, ’05, something like that.
1:09:44
I mean, really intensively.
1:09:48
And again, the technical side appeals to me.
1:09:51
I research, you know, into the ground.
1:09:53
Oh, this camera or that camera, this lens, that lens, but I
1:09:56
love doing community events.
1:09:58
I love, I love being able to be part of the community by recording the community.
1:10:03
It’s so exciting to me.
1:10:05
I’ve done a few weddings and that’s been, that’s been fun.
1:10:08
Nerve-racking.
1:10:09
You know, if you miss that moment, you miss that moment [laughs] . But
1:10:15
yeah, that’s been really important.
1:10:16
And the way I say it touches a different part of me is that frankly,
1:10:22
behind the camera you can hide a little bit, you know.
1:10:27
And so…
1:10:30
people, people have [stumbles] – I do a lot of travel photography.
1:10:33
It’s all over my walls and so on, and you know, upload it to a stock company.
1:10:39
And people say well if you’re taking a camera you’re not really
1:10:42
in the moment, but I swear this allows me to be in the moment.
1:10:46
I pay attention.
1:10:48
I see things.
1:10:49
The visual has always been really important to me and
1:10:52
I cannot draw worth a damn.
1:10:55
I’ve tried over and over.
1:10:56
But photography allows me to understand the visual.
1:11:00
So that’s…
1:11:04
So, kind of moving in towards the end I, while doing some background
1:11:09
research on you, I saw some of your professional involvements.
1:11:13
Could you tell us a little bit about your research interests?
1:11:16
And you mentioned your dissertation.
1:11:17
Yeah.
1:11:17
I think the most important thing has been the – I branched into psychotherapy.
1:11:25
I have been interested in psychotherapy since I was in my twenties.
1:11:29
Or earlier, really.
1:11:32
Didn’t – I think rightly didn’t have the chops then, the emotional chops,
1:11:37
to go into it as a career, and I’m really glad I did not, at that time.
1:11:43
And then when I moved out here, the – I had finished one, I had finished one
1:11:48
project that was moving toward being a book and I needed to start another
1:11:52
project and I was already working on the history of family therapy because
1:11:56
my then partner was training as a family therapist and got me really excited
1:12:02
about how it worked and what it was.
1:12:05
I still am excited about that.
1:12:07
And I started studying psychoanalysis in the 1950s because of a close connection
1:12:13
between psychothe—sorry, between family therapy and psychoanalysis in
1:12:18
the, and [laughs] psychoanalysis of serious mental illness in the fifties.
1:12:22
It was a bizarre and interesting time.
1:12:27
So, I started a project, and the project led me to believe that I
1:12:31
really wanted a clinical credential.
1:12:33
So in the early nineties, the university was nice enough to let me drop to half
1:12:37
time and pursue an MSW, a Master of Social Work at PSU, at Portland State.
1:12:44
And so, I drove up there part-time for three years and was trained in, well,
1:12:52
in social work, more broadly speaking; social justice issues and so on.
1:12:56
But also, I took their classes but also I trained myself and used supervisors
1:13:01
here in Corvallis to learn psychotherapy.
1:13:03
So, I did practice as a therapist in, um… at a local agency that
1:13:13
focuses on domestic violence.
1:13:15
So, I practiced with people there.
1:13:18
It was one of the most extraordinary times of my life.
1:13:23
I learned so much.
1:13:24
I learned increasing humility, but I [laughs] , I learned so much
1:13:29
about what I could and couldn’t do and what other people survive and
1:13:33
thr—and then learn to thrive after.
1:13:37
I mean, it’s just, that was amazing.
1:13:40
That was great.
1:13:41
But then I decided I wanted to be a mom, and having two careers and being
1:13:45
a mom just didn’t work out, so I came back to the books and the teaching.
1:13:54
All right.
1:13:54
Well, that’s all I have.
1:13:55
[Laughs]
1:13:57
Any other comments or things you’d like to add?
1:14:01
That’s a good question, and you know I should be right on top of it since
1:14:05
we’ve talked so much about the, about interviews and about… how they work… I
1:14:18
don't think so.
1:14:19
I think that what I’ve emphasized – I mean, I don't, I don't mean to end
1:14:25
on a negative note about myself but I think that what has been really
1:14:30
important for me, particularly in the last few years, is realizing that I owe
1:14:41
my kids, my students, my friends, the people I come in contact with.
1:14:47
I owe them honesty, and it hasn’t always been…
1:14:53
it hasn’t been easy to come by.
1:14:55
I’ve been very cautious all my life and I’m not proud of that, but I think it’s
1:15:00
important to talk about it; to say, if not I’m sorry, then I realize, you know.
1:15:10
So, and that has flavored my whole life.
1:15:15
So, I can be adventurous, I do live outside the [laughs] , a
1:15:20
little outside the box, but I think that’s my biggest regret.
1:15:23
But it’s also my biggest recognition, that – about myself.
1:15:27
Do you think it’s more important or equally important, to be honest with those
1:15:31
around you as you’re honest with yourself?
1:15:35
Like which one of those do you think is more important or [unintelligible]
1:15:37
? I think it has to be founded on honesty with yourself.
1:15:41
It has to be founded on honesty with yourself.
1:15:43
And we can’t always be honest with others.
1:15:45
Sometimes it’s cruel to be honest with others, and so I’ve
1:15:49
always lived kind of that way.
1:15:50
But in terms of owning my identity, that’s where I’ve cheated.
1:15:56
You know, that’s where I’ve… at both myself and others.
1:16:01
So, eh, I hope I’m over it, more or less.
1:16:06
Do you think if you could go back now, like this might be a cliché question, but—
1:16:10
No, it’s a great question.
1:16:12
—go back now knowing everything you know, like is there anything
1:16:16
you would have done differently?
1:16:19
Yeah, I think I would have been bolder.
1:16:21
I mean, I, I’ve done the gay and lesbian course – and we need to change its name,
1:16:26
by the way; I need to change the name to queer history – but you know, I’ve
1:16:31
taught this course for what, 20 years, and I think I needed to be more ahead of
1:16:39
the, more ahead of the curve than I’ve been in terms of what’s in the course.
1:16:43
I mean, it’s gotten better over time, but in terms of what’s in the
1:16:46
course, in terms of how the course can be used for on-campus, and for
1:16:55
people to explore their own lives, I
1:17:00
just think yeah, I think I would do that.
1:17:02
I think I would be more bold intellectually if I could go
1:17:06
back and do things over again.
1:17:09
I would be more bold intellectually, and thus perhaps
1:17:12
more productive intellectually
1:17:16
[laughs] . Yeah, I think that’s… I think that’s right.
1:17:23
For me, the academic life is about the freedom to read, the freedom
1:17:28
to thing, the – and the obligation
1:17:34
to help students be, be who they are and now that they have options to
1:17:39
try to help them break away from the limits that they put on themselves,
1:17:43
and that frankly, in many cases, their families have put on them.
1:17:46
“Go to school and get a business degree,” or whatever it is.
1:17:50
That’s the obligation and that piece I’ve been fairly true to, but I should
1:17:55
have been bolder intellectually, I think.
1:17:57
So, yeah.
1:18:00
All right, well I think that’s all we have then.
1:18:02
Yeah, thank you.
1:18:04
Yeah, no problem, thank you.
