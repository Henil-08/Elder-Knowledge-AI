00:01
My name is Lyndi Petty and I am conducting an oral history for my undergraduate
00:05
thesis at Oregon State University.
00:08
Today is May 26th, 2017 and the time is 5:10 p.m. And our interviewee will
00:19
introduce herself, or, themselves.
00:21
Hi!
00:22
My name is Jesseanne, I am an alumnus of Oregon State, graduated last June 2016.
00:34
Did I say my last name?
00:34
Jesseanne Pope.
00:36
Thank you.
00:38
So, to get started, where were you born and raised, and what
00:42
was it like growing up there?
00:44
I was born in Roseburg, Oregon, but I grew up in Grants Pass,
00:49
Oregon, and it was pretty shitty.
00:53
It's a terrible place, so I wouldn't recommend going there.
00:58
Growing up, I was, I guess I sort of... How I would describe it is
01:11
[Laughs] ... How I would describe it is.
01:15
Okay, so what I'm trying to say is I grew up in Southern Oregon, and it was
01:22
not very inclusive or diverse place.
01:24
And so, I struggled a little bit in middle school and in high school, not
01:30
having anyone that I could talk to that was feeling similar things to me and not
01:35
having really any communication in my family about anything of depth really.
01:41
So, I grew up in a single parent home, and my mom worked a lot, and I have
01:46
a lot of siblings, and so a lot of time was spent doing things that you
01:49
don't usually expect a child to do.
01:51
And I experienced a lot of trauma in my childhood, and so I just
01:57
had to mature really quickly.
01:59
And so, growing up, I don't really think about, much about, what it
02:04
was like to be a kid, but just about how I self-medicated with overworking
02:10
myself and being over involved.
02:12
And so the majority of my childhood, growing up, in my community was really
02:18
people constantly praising me for being so involved and working so hard
02:25
and no one really understanding that I was doing that so that I didn't
02:27
have to deal with what was going on inside of me or the things that I was
02:32
feeling that I couldn't really express.
02:35
The community, like I said, the main thing that shaped me was the lack of
02:40
diversity in Southern Oregon as far as pretty much every social identity that
02:44
you could imagine, so a lack of diversity as far as race and ethnicity, sexual
02:50
orientation and gender presentation, and pretty much everything else, so.
02:59
So, you kinda mentioned this but, describe the community you grew up in.
03:04
How did your community shape you as a person?
03:07
Should I look at you or the camera?
03:08
[Laughs]
03:09
Whatever you're doing now is perfect.
03:10
Okay [Laughs] ! So how it shaped me, I think, and obviously when I say these
03:18
things, I can say them now, but I wouldn't have been able to voice them at the time.
03:23
Now I have much more language and awareness to talk about these things,
03:26
but I think the biggest thing was that I didn't have representation of people
03:30
who talked about or who I knew felt the same things that I did, especially
03:36
around sexuality and gender presentation.
03:39
And
03:42
my family, like I said, we didn't really, I don't know if it was,
03:48
for what reason it was that we didn't really talk about deep
03:51
things or how we were feeling.
03:53
And I really very much closed myself off emotionally, and I hid that by
04:02
acting very extraverted and being super involved and doing pretty much
04:06
everything that you could probably do.
04:07
I mean, I took a class during my lunch period in high school so
04:11
that I was always doing things.
04:12
And I took advanced weight training before school, and then I had
04:16
athletic practice after school, so I was, I had no free time, and
04:19
that was exactly how I wanted it.
04:21
And I think the biggest way that my community shaped me
04:27
is pushing me out of there.
04:28
You know?
04:29
It was so, it was such a bad experience for me that I had no choice but to
04:34
leave, which was exactly what I needed.
04:39
So, you came to OSU, and why did you come to OSU in particular?
04:46
Yeah, so when I was in high school, my plan was to go to University of Oregon.
04:51
I really don't know why.
04:52
I just wanted to get out of Southern Oregon.
04:57
But, I actually, so I enrolled, and I went there and went to
05:01
orientation and really hated it.
05:05
I felt super disconnected.
05:06
And I think the biggest thing for me is that all the people I met and spent
05:11
time with were really not nice people.
05:14
They were nice to me, but they weren't to other people, specifically
05:17
people who were different than them.
05:19
So, as I spent a couple of days there and I watched how they talked about
05:23
other people and treated other people, it just felt really, I just had a
05:26
lot of really bad feelings inside.
05:29
So, I actually ended up going back to Grants Pass and going to our community
05:33
college there for a little bit, as in one year [Laughs] . And then I
05:36
came to Oregon State actually because my brother was attending here, and
05:40
so I moved in with him, and that's kinda how I started at Oregon State.
05:45
And I would say the difference for me between how I felt when I walked on to
05:51
U of O's campus and how I felt when I walked on OSU's campus was very different,
05:56
just in the sense that when I walked onto Oregon State's campus and looked at people
06:03
and smiled at them and talked to them, I got some sort of response back, you know?
06:09
People were helpful and people were nice.
06:11
And the campus is, I think, constructed in a way that it feels
06:15
connected, which is not something that I felt on U of O's campus.
06:21
And so, I think it was a really good change for me, that I felt more of,
06:29
that it was a community and that was something that I needed.
06:32
So,
06:35
was that your first impression of OSU, was that this sense of small-town community?
06:41
Was there anything else you would add to that first impression?
06:46
So, when I came to Oregon State I was definitely not, I was very, at
06:50
a different place that I am now.
06:52
And I would say that when I first got here, I would fall into that category
06:57
of "White Feminist." I was very ignorant of the majority of social issues,
07:01
but I had had some experiences with protest and with social justice, mostly
07:06
through the fact that I am a survivor.
07:08
And so, I got involved with Take Back the Night and Sexual Assault Awareness
07:12
month at the end of high school and stuff, thanks to my sister-in-law and my Brother.
07:17
And so that was kind of my introduction into it, so I was like, "Oh all
07:21
of these issues are so fucked up." Am I allowed to say that?
07:25
Okay, well, I already did, so [Laughs] . And, you know, I was really passionate
07:30
about that kind of stuff and I'd never met another person who I knew experienced
07:34
sexual violence of any kind and or definitely not people who talked about it.
07:38
So that was my entrance into social justice, but I was super
07:41
unaware of all the other things.
07:43
So, when I came to Oregon State, I wouldn't say that I saw issues
07:46
right off the bat because I'm white.
07:49
And I definitely didn't feel
07:54
like there were spaces where I couldn't go into or where I didn't belong.
07:58
I was definitely welcomed.
07:59
And I have, by the time I got here I had, I guess like 20-21 years of
08:08
experience hiding my social class and assimilating into middle and upper class,
08:15
just, culture in general.
08:17
That allowed me to fit in here as well, because I think there definitely is that
08:21
expectation that you understand how to navigate these sort of circumstances, and
08:26
so I already had experience doing that.
08:29
And that, I think, allowed me to fit in okay.
08:33
And so, my first impressions, I think, were just that there was a
08:37
community, that there was always stuff to do and people to meet.
08:43
So that was really important to me, because like I said
08:45
the way I self-medicated was overinvolvement and staying busy
08:50
and not having any down time, so.
08:55
So, you seem to be somebody who got really involved at OSU.
09:00
What organizations did you get involved with, and what led
09:05
you to get involved with them?
09:06
Yeah.
09:07
So, it definitely started out with my need to work to afford living.
09:16
So I actually, I got a job at OSU before I even, ever, came to campus.
09:21
So, I was living in England with my family in the summer, and, before I
09:26
came to Oregon State, and I got a job
09:32
just by sending in my resume, I guess, just working in an office
09:36
on campus as an office assistant.
09:38
And, so that's how it started because I started working in the School of
09:42
Psychological Science, and as I started doing that, I started meeting professors
09:47
and I started doing childcare for them.
09:50
And then I started serving on tenure committees within the
09:54
school, and just started getting more opportunities through that.
10:01
And then,
10:04
it was during that year that I found out about opportunities for diversity
10:10
work, which like I said I still didn't really understand at that point, but
10:15
I heard about the position, Community Relations Facilitator in UHDS, and
10:21
that was, and I applied for it.
10:22
And that was the first position that I had that was diversity related, and
10:26
it's the position that I was working in when I found out about Examining White
10:30
Identity Retreat, the social justice retreat that Oregon State offers.
10:35
And I attended that my second year at Oregon State, and that is the moment that
10:40
changed my life and my trajectory both at OSU and in gen- really everything.
10:46
EWI was the, easily, the most transformative thing that I did
10:52
in my life or at Oregon State.
10:54
And it wasn't until EWI that I really even had much awareness of issues outside of,
11:03
I mean I would say as far as structural and systemic racism and institutionalized
11:08
oppression and intersectionality.
11:12
These things weren't really on my radar very much until I
11:16
attended Examining White Identity.
11:18
So that is what kind of pushed me into diversity and social justice work.
11:24
Did I answer the question?
11:26
Yeah, no, totally!
11:28
I thought you were going to keep going.
11:29
[Laughs] Well I could, trust me.
11:31
I'm trying to let you ask your questions because I'll probably
11:35
answer them if I just keep rambling.
11:38
I mean if you have any other organizations that you feel you
11:40
want to highlight, go for it.
11:43
We're only at eleven minutes.
11:43
As far as involvement wise?
11:46
Yeah well, so after EWI, my plan was to continue working as a Community
11:54
Relations Facilitator, but I actually, I had some family things going on and I
12:00
ended up leaving to go back to England.
12:03
My grandparents lived in England my whole life, and then my Grandfather
12:09
passed away right after I left England the first time, and so that
12:13
left my Grandma there by herself.
12:17
They were together for years like thirty years, and they were one of
12:19
those couples that did everything together, so she had a really hard time.
12:22
And so, my sister, my mom, and I took turns being there with her
12:27
and getting her ready to come here.
12:28
So I actually, I wasn't able to continue being a CRF and I left there.
12:33
And when I came back, I heard about this opportunity to work at the cultural
12:42
resource centers, and I didn't, at that point I didn't know that much about them.
12:47
And I wanted to work at the Pride Center, but I was not,
12:51
definitely not out at that point.
12:54
And I'd been in the Pride Center a couple of times, and there were some folks who
12:58
were working at the Pride Center and who were involved in Diversity and Cultural
13:01
Engagement who I had... How do I describe
13:10
this?
13:10
I guess I definitely felt the desire to be around them because
13:15
they had a sort of authenticity that I didn't and that I wanted to have.
13:21
But at the same time, I didn't feel, I didn't know how to exist
13:26
in an authentic space when I'm not being my authentic self.
13:29
And so, I ended up working at the Women's Center, which was also a very
13:35
important part of my time at OSU, specifically because of the people that
13:40
I worked with and because of Whitney, who's the AD at the Women's Center.
13:46
And from the very first time that I started talking to Whitney,
13:50
and all of the times that I was in her office crying, and just
13:56
all the things that I experienced in the time that I worked with her, and
13:59
all the ways that I grew, she was with me through my entire coming out
14:03
process, and even much before that.
14:07
And there was something about the way Whitney would talk with me.
14:12
It's like, she knew that there were things that I wanted to say that I wasn't
14:18
saying, and she very much created a space where I could navigate that and
14:23
I didn't, and there wasn't pressure.
14:26
And there were other folks too, like Brandi Douglas and Teresita, who I would
14:31
end up in their office and I would be crying and I would say, you know "I'm
14:34
crying because I'm stressed," but it's not really why I was crying, or not
14:38
really why I was having a hard time.
14:40
It was because I couldn't say the things that I wanted to
14:42
say because I didn't know how.
14:45
And, I think also just, I need to say, it's really hard to do social justice work
14:51
when you're not being your authentic self.
14:53
It's really hard to give a workshop on, you know...
14:59
Identity and stuff...
15:00
Yeah!
15:00
On identity!
15:01
Literally I would be like, "Here's an identity wheel, let's talk about
15:04
your identities," and just, yeah.
15:09
I could imagine that would be really difficult.
15:11
Yeah, difficult is one word, yes.
15:14
It was difficult and it was, I didn't feel like it was okay for me to do.
15:19
I felt even more fake than I did just existing.
15:23
So, I struggled with that a little bit.
15:26
And when I started working at the Women's Center, I think I got the
15:28
opportunity to do more intersectional work and to talk about other things.
15:33
On
15:36
track, okay.
15:36
The question is involvement.
15:38
So I worked at the Women's Center and then because I worked for Diversity
15:42
and Cultural Engagement, is how I found out about Social Change Leadership
15:44
Programs, which was a new office on campus that had three, well I mean
15:50
it had new student staff positions.
15:54
There were supposed to be two of them for dialogue educators, and they ended up
15:58
hiring three - Haniya, Jasmine, and I. And the reason was because Miguel and I had
16:04
talked about, I was going to graduate and they both were going to stay and it was an
16:09
opportunity for us to kind of bring all of our strengths and experiences together and
16:13
to really make, to build a foundation for this office, this is really ironic, but to
16:19
really build a foundation for this office.
16:21
And, you know, and so they decided to bring on three of us, which I'm
16:27
super thankful for because that changed my life and, I don't know.
16:32
Anyway, so that was the other involvement.
16:36
Okay, I think I answered your question.
16:38
You definitely did...
16:38
[Laughs]
16:39
Thank you for explaining.
16:42
So now moving into talking about the Speak Out, how did you become
16:48
involved with organizing the Speak Out?
16:51
Why was it important for you to create a platform for students of color to
16:55
voice their concerns and experiences?
16:59
So,
17:02
Haniya, Jasmine, and I had an interesting time in our positions
17:06
in Social Change Leadership Programs because we were without a
17:10
supervisor for quite a long time.
17:12
So, this meant that the three of us spent a lot of time in
17:15
this office kind of [Laughs]
17:19
trying to figure out what our purpose was both in the office and in that position.
17:28
And
17:31
we didn't really have much structure or guidance just because of the
17:34
situation, without having a supervisor for a while, and we all had experience
17:40
in different ways, as far as diversity and social justice goes.
17:45
But I think for me,
17:50
well, okay, so there wasn't necessarily a specific catalyst on our campus.
17:58
Haniya talked a little bit about Mizzou and the fact that that was sort of
18:03
how it started, and what happened is that... So, everything was happening on
18:09
Mizzou, and conversations were definitely happening on our campus as far as
18:15
how are similar structures in place on our campus and what's going on
18:19
for students of color on our campus.
18:21
And I ended up in someone's office in Diversity and Cultural
18:27
Engagement, just talking about
18:32
how I felt that what was happening at Mizzou was really similar to what
18:37
could potentially happen at Oregon State, and that the experience that
18:43
folks were talking about at Mizzou are experiences that I have heard my
18:48
coworkers, and my colleagues, and my friends talk about at Oregon State.
18:52
And I just felt a lot, I have a lot of emotions.
18:57
I felt a lot of different things, and I guess it kinda culminated in
19:04
a frustration of 'Why isn't this happening?' And there were also, there
19:10
were a lot of other things going on in that students of color were experiencing
19:14
a lot of barriers within Diversity and Cultural Engagement and as far as
19:20
being shut down and not being heard.
19:22
And I was witnessing this happen.
19:25
These were all of my friends.
19:27
All of the staff within DCE, we were not only coworkers but also
19:33
friends, and I spent a lot of time with staff across all of the cultural
19:38
resource centers and was just hearing a lot of things that were really
19:45
fucked up.
19:46
And so I started talking about this, and the really shitty thing is that all of the
19:53
things that I said in this office at the beginning of this whole, how this whole
19:59
thing got started, students of color had been saying for a long time, to the same
20:04
person that I was talking to, and to staff within DCE, to their ADs, to each other.
20:09
Students of color had been saying it for a long time.
20:13
And when, the fact that it makes a difference when I say it speaks
20:18
to the whole issue of why we had to have it to begin with.
20:22
And so, when I was saying these things and this person was like, "Okay, well
20:25
yeah, let's, you know, what are we going to do about it?" I'm like, "Okay
20:27
well, what we're going to do about it is that we're going to give students
20:31
of color a voice." Haniya and Jasmine, bless their little hearts, I came back
20:37
into our office fuming and raging, and I was like, "This is happening!" and I
20:45
remember the conversation, it just started out with, me being like "I'm so sorry!
20:51
You've said this, and you've said this, and you've all said this!" There were
20:54
other folks in the office as well, students of color, students who work
20:58
for DCE, who had said all of these things, and I just said, "What can we
21:04
do?" And for people who, I don't know, yeah, who will watch this, for people
21:10
who don't know, Haniya, Jasmine, and I,
21:15
I don't know, we [laughs] , we have a very unique, [to off camera] you distract me.
21:28
Okay, we have a very unique, we're a very unique team, this
21:32
is what I would like to say.
21:33
We're a very unique team, and I think when you get us
21:36
together, a lot of things happen.
21:38
I don't know what it is a combination of, our personalities and how they complement
21:42
each other, or the passion that we have or what it is, but I think people knew
21:49
as soon as we came together in this office, and shout out to Miguel for
21:53
making that happen, there's intent there.
21:57
And even if we didn't see it in the beginning, we quickly did.
22:00
And so, we came together, and I came to them and I said, "What can we do?"
22:05
and that's kind of where it started.
22:07
And from, I think that the other thing that's important to say is, Haniya
22:14
mentioned this and I just said too, I may have started these conversations, but
22:20
I just really need people to understand that I literally utilized white privilege
22:27
to make it heard, and that was the whole point of the Students of Color Speak Out.
22:33
Is that, if the same words are coming out of my mouth, why does that matter
22:38
more than when they're coming out of other students' mouths, like students of
22:41
color who've been saying the same things?
22:43
And why is it that I'm allowed to navigate these spaces when they're
22:49
not even my experiences, you know?
22:52
And so, we talked about that, and honestly, we talked about so much.
22:56
I could never say it in one interview, all the things that
22:59
Haniya, Jasmine, and I talked about.
23:01
But I think instantly, especially the staff in DCE, they saw that shit was
23:07
happening and we were not messing around.
23:09
And, I forgot what your original question was.
23:14
It was just why was it important for you to create the platform?
23:18
Okay, so, I'm trying to stay on track here because I can talk about this for a
23:22
long time but there's not really, okay....
23:26
Do you want me to move on to the next question?
23:28
Did I answer that question?
23:30
Yeah, you definitely did!
23:31
Okay, yeah, go ahead.
23:34
You already answered that there wasn't really a catalyst moment
23:37
per say, but more of like...
23:40
I would say that the catalyst moment was Miguel hiring Haniya, Jasmine, and I.
23:44
And can you expand on who Miguel is?
23:53
Position?
23:54
Well, he doesn't work here anymore, but he was the coordinator for Social Change
23:58
Leadership Programs for a little bit.
24:00
What did Miguel do before that [asking someone off camera] ? Okay, yes.
24:08
For how long [asking someone off camera] ? Two?
24:10
Two years?
24:11
So, I think that, from what I remember Miguel was the graduate assistant for
24:17
the Centro for two years, maybe more, and then transitioned into SCLP [off camera
24:23
unintelligible murmuring] . I don't know;
24:28
stop messing me up [telling someone off camera] . Okay, sorry.
24:31
We might need to get that part.
24:32
[Laughs] So Miguel was our supervisor when Haniya, Jasmine, and I got hired and then
24:39
transitioned to a different position at a different university, which was why we
24:43
were without a supervisor for a little bit, but Miguel was the one who hired the
24:47
three of us and kinda made that decision.
24:50
We also had other positions.
24:51
I was still working at the Women's Center.
24:53
And so, you know, that ability to have us work a little bit less hours allowed
24:58
us to have three of us versus the two that they had intended to hire, so yeah.
25:05
Thank you for explaining.
25:08
So, what did you hope to achieve from the Speak
25:17
Out?
25:17
[Laughs] I will give a concise answer to that question.
25:20
Well, we did create a list of demands.
25:24
Haniya, Jasmine, and I kind of, we sat down and we talked about
25:29
what are some of the things that we're seeing and experiencing, and
25:32
what is the root cause of them?
25:36
And so, some of the things that we talked about were really similar to
25:39
Mizzou and to other universities that had put forward demands that, who's,
25:44
primarily students of color at other universities had put forward demands.
25:48
So they were things like hiring more faculty of color, faculty and staff of
25:54
color, which is something that OSU does not and has not and still doesn't do
26:01
- is have a more diverse representation among staff and faculty of color, and
26:09
that is so vital and important because a lot of the experiences of students
26:17
of color are having in the classroom is a result of ignorant professors
26:22
who aren't aware of institutional racism or who refuse to address
26:28
microaggressions in the classroom.
26:30
And so, you know, that was an example of one of the things, and another
26:34
one was about bias reporting, how transparent the university was being.
26:41
So, one of the things we demanded was that they release information around
26:46
hate crimes on campus and make it more accessible and so that is why they started
26:51
listing it more directly on the website, so you can access that information.
26:55
So, reporting and bias incidents and hate crimes and stuff like that is definitely
27:00
one of them and making the process more accessible and less harmful for
27:05
students who are reporting these things.
27:07
And then also hiring a Chief Diversity Officer.
27:11
So, after the Speak Out there were some adjustments in departments on
27:16
campus and staff, and the first, well the first permanent CDO is
27:22
supposed to be starting in June.
27:26
I mean it's been two years since the Speak Out and the first permanent
27:33
CDO will be starting in June, and in the meantime, Angela Bautista has
27:39
been serving in that interim role.
27:42
But you know, that just speaks to the fact that this is how long it's taken.
27:47
So
27:50
those were some of our, I mean, does that...
27:53
Are there any other demands you can think of?
27:57
Were those the couple big ones?
28:00
Yeah, so the faculty and staff was definitely a big one.
28:03
The reporting and transparency was definitely a big one.
28:06
And also, it was about creating a platform and accessibility for students
28:10
of color to share their experience and to talk about it and to be heard, and
28:15
so that's kinda where the town halls came from, which were not accessible
28:21
for students of color, or, yeah.
28:24
So, that was one of the other requests, was creating that space,
28:31
so.
28:32
So, where there other folks involved with organizing the Speak Out?
28:39
Were there any people in administration or staff who really were kinda crucial
28:48
to helping you or not helping you?
28:51
[Laughs] Yeah, those are two different questions.
28:54
Yeah.
28:54
So,
28:58
I worked as a student employee at Oregon State for quite a long time, and
29:05
the messages that I constantly heard, and even now as a student
29:09
affairs professional, the messages I still hear are something like,
29:15
"Tread carefully," or "Navigate," you know, "Navigate the system.
29:19
Navigate this.
29:19
Navigate that." Which really what those messages mean is that you need to
29:25
assimilate, and you need to be compliant and you need to work the system that
29:29
you have. And so, when Haniya, Jasmine, and I started the work on the Speak Out,
29:34
this was the reaction that we got. It was a lot of like, "Whoa, slow down.
29:39
Did you think about this?" Kind of like, how do we make this, how do we make
29:45
this work within our systems, which was the opposite of what we were intending.
29:52
So,
29:55
I wouldn't say, I would say that I had never, before the Speak Out
29:59
I had never felt... [video cut]
30:02
So, when we started planning the Speak Out, we definitely felt
30:07
like, we really leaned heavily into each other because we didn't have
30:11
support from faculty and staff,
30:15
especially in the beginning.
30:16
And I think that, you know what, I'm not going to make any excuses for it.
30:22
We felt very
30:26
abandoned, and a lot of folks were concerned for what it would look like
30:35
and what it meant for us to be doing this work when we were employees of
30:40
Student Leadership and Involvement and Diversity and Cultural engagement,
30:42
because our positions were kind of within both of those departments.
30:46
And so, a lot of folks were concerned about what that means
30:49
and how that projects onto their office or to themselves.
30:54
We got a lot of what I would consider,
31:01
you know what, I don't even know the word for it.
31:03
We end up in a lot of meetings where I felt extremely belittled, and where
31:08
I lo-, where faculty and staff that I had really looked up to, I felt
31:15
like I could no longer trust them.
31:17
And, I heard messages from them that I really was shocked to hear, especially
31:24
around the idea of "You need to navigate the system and you need to be smart
31:31
about this." And I think, first of all, there was the underlying assumption
31:35
that we weren't being smart about it, that we hadn't thought about how best to
31:38
go about this, and the reality is that folks just didn't agree with our methods.
31:45
And so, I wouldn't say that there was someone.
31:49
There were definitely people who wanted to support us and who tried to support us,
31:57
but the reality is as student employees, as students, we had
32:02
more flexibility than they felt that they had as staff on campus.
32:12
So, you kinda spoke to challenges that have arose, or that did arise during.
32:19
Are there any other major challenges to organizing something as big as this?
32:26
I mean, yeah, there were a lot.
32:29
So we were employed by Social Change Leadership Programs, which
32:35
I mean, if you would think about the title of that office, you would
32:38
think it aligns pretty well with what the Speak Out was about, but
32:47
other people did not believe that it did, or that it was something that we could
32:53
align with our positions in the office.
32:55
So, we had to create a very clear distinction between the work that we
32:59
were doing as students and the work that we were doing as employees.
33:02
And so that meant that when we were at work we couldn't talk about or
33:07
do work for the Speak Out and that we just needed to do our things.
33:12
And I think the hardest thing is that we carry all of our
33:15
identities with us everywhere we go.
33:17
Obviously, we don't, we can't separate that, and the experiences
33:20
that we have as students impact us as employees and vice versa.
33:25
So, it was really hard for us.
33:28
And also, the fact that everyone wanted to talk to us about the
33:32
Speak Out when we were working, so we were losing significant amount
33:35
of hours, which impacts, obviously, how much we're getting paid, and
33:39
the fact that we work to survive.
33:41
And so it really got very stressful and very intense, as far as how we had time
33:48
to plan this and to make everything happen, because it took a lot of time
33:53
for us to continually talk about it, and to figure what space we were going
33:58
to use, how we were going to create the environment that we needed for the
34:03
Speak Out to happen, and also how we were going to make people aware of it.
34:07
So, it was a lot of time and effort and energy from all of
34:11
us to kinda make that happen,
34:15
yeah.
34:17
How long did it take?
34:19
Like, weeks, to actually, from start to finish?
34:24
I think about a week.
34:28
Oh!
34:30
So that's, okay, so,
34:34
from the initial conversation that I had until the Speak Out, maybe a little bit
34:40
more, but the reality is that we spent all day of that time, between when we had
34:47
our conversation and when the Speak Out happened, talking about and planning this.
34:53
It invaded every single minute of our days.
34:57
In trying to do self-care to support each other, to involve the people
35:03
that we needed to be involved, and that stuff, that might sound like it
35:09
was a short amount of time, but it was a lot of work within that time.
35:13
And also, the reality of it was that we just felt these demands that we're
35:21
putting forward are not things that we can wait for, and they are things
35:26
that should've already been happening.
35:28
And so, every minute that we put it off is just more time that students of color
35:34
are not being supported on our campus.
35:38
And so there definitely was a sense of urgency.
35:40
And also, you know, everything at Mizzou was happening at the same time,
35:45
and so there definitely was a national climate that was behind us, that was
35:51
supporting us, maybe pushing us was a better word, and yeah, I mean, a
35:59
sense of urgency because our campus was not one that was created for us and
36:07
we needed, we wanted to change that.
36:10
And that was our motivation to kinda just make it happen.
36:15
Thank you for expanding.
36:17
Were
36:20
there other strategies that you considered, or was the
36:25
Speak Out kind of the best way you felt to create a platform?
36:30
Well I mean we - Haniya, Jasmine, and I - all did and do social justice work,
36:39
and, you know, in employment, like in our jobs, but also outside of it.
36:44
And, I mean, I think every day that is something like another avenue.
36:51
And, I mean, honestly, students of color existing on this campus is an
36:56
avenue of creating that environment.
37:00
And for me specifically, I definitely considered other things, as far as
37:06
what I can do and also navigating, understanding what it means to be a white
37:12
person trying to do anti-racist work and to have these conversations, and in
37:17
what ways I can find my place in that.
37:23
And so there were a lot of things that I thought about doing, but it's a very,
37:34
it's a very fine line of navigating how I can use my white privilege and how I can
37:40
access the spaces and then use my voice in that so that I can lift up students
37:48
of color's voices and create that space.
37:51
So at the Speak Out, an example of that is the fact that, Haniya talked
37:58
about that white man getting up to talk, but I, the only thing that
38:02
I said at the Speak Out was that white people were there to listen.
38:06
And the whole point, that was very intentional.
38:09
Haniya, Jasmine, and I talked a lot about what that looked like and how to
38:13
show up in the space, because like I said, when this all started it was the
38:19
fact that people were willing to listen to me when students of color had been
38:21
saying the same thing, and we needed to shut that down and to stop that.
38:27
And that was kinda what we were hoping to do with the Speak Out, and with my
38:32
words that were said at the Speak Out.
38:34
And other avenues for making this change, I think for me is....
38:42
After the Speak Out, Haniya and Jasmine were, you know, asked to be on all these
38:47
committees and to do this and to do that, and the reality is that OSU is addressing,
38:53
did address and is addressing the issues by creating situations that continues
38:58
to make students of color do the work.
39:00
And so, I think when I'm thinking about other avenues, you know, it's about
39:07
supporting students of color and stop the systems and the paradigms, especially
39:14
on campus and within the administration, that are like, "Okay, well, where are
39:19
the students of color? Why aren't they doing this or why aren't they doing
39:22
that?" and really kind of trying to reframe the conversation and putting the
39:26
responsibility and the accountability on staff and faculty and administration.
39:36
So,
39:39
what was the campus climate like prior to the event?
39:43
Were their certain needs that the university wasn't addressing?
39:45
[Laughs]
39:46
And
39:48
maybe just try to be specific about....
39:50
Okay.
39:51
So, I mean, I'm obviously not a student.... I shouldn't say obviously,
39:57
I'm not a student of color, and I, so I mean, I'm going to try and answer
40:05
this question, but I also don't wanna speak for students of color, and, you
40:10
know, my awareness and my perception is really only based on students of
40:15
color who have been vulnerable and shared these things with me and also
40:18
things that I've witnessed and seen.
40:20
For example, the first class that I ever took at Oregon State was a history
40:25
class, and my first day in that class,
40:29
the professor was giving an overview of everything we were going to cover
40:33
that term, and the professor asked a student of color in that class who, on
40:41
a visual scan, was probably the only black person in that class, and the
40:46
professor looked right at the student and asked them if they'd be willing to
40:49
share their opinion and their experience when we talked about the Civil War.
40:55
And I was so in complete and utter shock, that I got up and left
41:01
that class and I never went back.
41:03
And when I think about that now, it really frustrates me that I didn't
41:08
do anything else, and I didn't do better, because I didn't take it upon
41:13
myself to understand it to get the tools that I needed to navigate that.
41:18
Which would be different now, but I think that just speaks to, as soon as
41:23
I got here that was one of my first experiences in recognizing that one,
41:27
there is virtually, the diversity at OSU is not what it talks about.
41:33
OSU talking about having an inclusive and diverse environment, but it's
41:37
not the reality when you're here and when you're navigating it.
41:42
And so, you know, that was a way for me to recognize that that's not the
41:47
reality, and that was before any of my social justice work or anything.
41:52
And so, I think that the environment was definitely one where everything is catered
41:59
to protecting white student's feelings and protecting the administration.
42:04
And so, you know, when an incident, a bias incident, would happen, it was
42:09
very much like, "Okay, well, how can we contain this so that people don't get
42:15
aware of it?" and it was always talked about like, "We don't want to scare
42:19
people." or "We don't want to make people feel unsafe." But by not making that
42:24
information accessible, first of all, that is not a choice that the administration
42:28
should be making for students of color.
42:30
All of the information should be accessible, and, well yeah, just period.
42:36
And so, I think that was one of the things definitely that they were doing,
42:39
is not making the information accessible.
42:42
And then not addressing and naming the root issues of hate crimes.
42:46
So, if something were to happen, never, you don't hear the words white supremacy.
42:51
You don't hear the words institutional racism.
42:53
These words were not coming out of the administrations mouth, which is, I think,
42:58
one of the issues, and how the university was not including, not living out their
43:04
values of diversity and inclusion and supporting students of color, because
43:09
they were not naming the issues, which allows it to just be like "This person
43:13
is just not a good person and that's why they did that." Well, that's not,
43:18
we're not talking about the issues that are systemic in the university.
43:22
So, I think that was definitely one of them.
43:24
And, you know, and then my, one of the other biggest ones was faculty making
43:31
racist comments in class or not addressing microaggressions or, you know, creating
43:36
environments in their classrooms that were not safe for students of color.
43:40
This was happening on a regular basis, but at the same time, when it
43:44
was brought up there was always such shock of like, "What do you mean that
43:47
happened? This doesn't usually happen." but it does happen all the time.
43:51
And so, I think that that was definitely one of the things that was on my mind
43:56
as far as something that the university was not doing, was addressing that.
44:03
So, during the Speak Out, what was that like for you
44:08
personally, being in that space?
44:12
Was it, did it end up being like you expected, like the outcome of it?
44:19
I
44:24
wouldn't, I don't know if I had that many expectations going in.
44:28
I tried not to.
44:31
I knew my role, and....
44:39
I think for me,
44:42
it was a process of understanding my role and understanding what I
44:46
needed to do and how I could support.
44:49
Students of color in general, yes, but there were a lot of people in that room
44:52
that I love very dearly, and for me, knowing how to navigate that, and how to
44:59
support them, and not to reproduce the issues that we're trying to address,
45:05
and to not bring my voice into a space where, that was create not, that was
45:10
not created for my voice, you know?
45:14
I joke about how much space I take up, but it's a real thing.
45:18
And I talk a lot.
45:19
And we - Haniya, Jasmine, and I - had talked a lot about how my
45:25
voice is more welcomed in a space.
45:27
And so, I didn't, what was on my mind the whole time was not doing that, and
45:34
just looking around and seeing and being physically with these people that I
45:41
loved so much, and also thinking about
45:47
the impact that what's being said is having on all of them was really kind of
45:53
where my mind was at, as far as feelings.
45:55
Yeah, I was having a lot of feelings, and frustration was
45:59
definitely one of them, because, you know, one of the first people
46:03
that got up to talk was a white man.
46:06
And, you know, I was just so, I was a little bit disappointed in that
46:13
moment because I was like, "How is this already going to happen?" And
46:17
then there was some logistical things that were going on with the live
46:21
broadcast, which never was brought to our attention, and we were never told
46:26
that there was going to be a livechat.
46:28
And so there were a lot, there were a lot of extremely racist comments
46:33
being made and things like that being said on the live chat, so I was also
46:36
trying to deal with "how do we get this shut down?" and trying to communicate
46:39
with them, and physically being up and moving around trying to make that
46:42
happen during it, which was another thing that was going on in my mind.
46:50
I think overall the experience for me was,
46:57
yeah, I mean, I don't know if there's
47:01
anything else I can say about that.
47:04
Oh no, that was good.
47:04
Okay.
47:08
So, post Speak Out, after the Speak Out, describe the immediate response from OSU
47:15
administration regarding the Speak Out.
47:17
Did they invite you to future conversations?
47:20
If so, did you feel that your voice was heard?
47:24
So, some of the immediate reactions, we had some faculty, groups,
47:31
publish letters in support of us.
47:36
I'm just going to leave that there.
47:38
And The Barometer wrote some articles, which just continually perpetuated the
47:44
exact things that we were talking about.
47:45
They centered my voice in the articles, which was one of the first
47:51
articles that came out after the Speak Out quoted me eight times in the
47:55
article, and one of the first things I said to them was not to do that.
47:59
And so, that just felt really shitty.
48:02
And, you know, and then I published a response to it because I was
48:07
so blown away that they really dismissed the entire thing.
48:12
And then their response to me was like "Oh, well, we weren't really able to
48:16
get students of color to say much." And really, that just points to the exact
48:22
issue that we're putting all of this weight onto students of color and asking
48:26
them to do all of this work to continually relive their trauma and to lay it all out
48:31
for white people to learn and to grow.
48:34
And that is just, that was really shitty for me.
48:40
And so I, that was one of the things that we, the three of us, were trying
48:44
to navigate after, was like, "How is this situation being reported
48:47
on?" and "Whose voices are being heard?" and that kind of thing.
48:51
And then the, OSU's
48:54
response was also in the letter format.
48:59
I think they really do like their published letters.
49:01
So, we received some of those, and then we were asked to come into spaces and
49:07
to be, yeah, involved in committees.
49:10
And we did meet with President Ed Ray and other staff members, who I
49:18
don't know exactly who they were.
49:23
But, what it felt like to me was that the point of us being invited into those
49:30
spaces was to sort of make us feel like
49:36
they were serious about the things that they were saying they were going to do,
49:41
but then when it came to asking questions like, "Well when is this going to happen?
49:45
What's it going to look like?", we got answers like, "Well we're still unsure.
49:50
We're still figuring it out." You know, and the leadership council for diversity,
49:54
or, I don't know the official very long name, at OSU that was formed, you
50:02
know, their statements are very vague, which is the issue in the beginning.
50:06
You know, like "We want to work to create better systems," you know, or,
50:11
"We want to encourage faculty to be more inclusive and to be more diverse." And
50:18
it's just like, there are no numbers.
50:21
There are no dates.
50:22
There are no specifics.
50:24
And that's really kind of how everything was addressed and is
50:29
still being addressed, as far as "What are we doing? Well this is our
50:33
hope." So that's kinda the reaction.
50:36
And then from students, I had a lot of, I had a lot of white students
50:44
who wanted to talk about....
50:47
I would say there were a couple of groups.
50:49
There were some white students who wanted to meet with me to tell
50:53
me how extremely racist I was,
50:57
and then tell me about all of their times when they experienced
51:00
racism as a white person.
51:02
And then there were another group of students who wanted to know
51:06
like, "What can I do?" You know?
51:08
And so, I would say that there was a balance of responses from students.
51:14
There were definitely students who took to, took to online
51:18
avenues to express their
51:24
feelings, had a lot of feelings, so, online as far as the Speak Out
51:29
and students of color experiences on campus and etc. So, I spent a
51:35
lot of time talking with people who
51:38
didn't appreciate me or the work that we had done for the Speak Out.
51:43
And, I think that for me it was really good to kind of understand and
51:48
to see where some of these students are at compared to the people that
51:54
I'm usually around, because I am working for DCE, and my friends,
51:58
all of us do social justice work.
52:02
And so, you know, it's important for me, I think, as a white person to remove
52:06
myself from that and to engage with other people who are not at that level,
52:10
because it shouldn't be on students of color to be educating white students all
52:16
the time, especially at Oregon State, a predominantly white institution where
52:19
a lot of folks come here from places in Oregon and other states and have never
52:25
interacted with people of color or never thought about the fact that their white.
52:28
You know?
52:29
And I think it's important for me to navigate that so
52:33
students of color don't have to.
52:36
[Unintelligible] Thank you for
52:41
that.
52:41
You kind of answered several of my questions in that, inadvertently.
52:46
[Laughs]
52:48
Did anyone reach out to you personally from the OSU community or even
52:54
Corvallis community, for that matter?
53:00
You said students did.
53:01
Yeah.
53:02
But anyone else?
53:04
Well I have some mentors on campus that I worked with for a long time who did.
53:10
Some of the folks I mentioned earlier, just to kind of check in, with all of
53:15
us - Haniya, Jasmine, and I. But like I said, we were very much on edge after
53:21
being so, after feeling so unsupported, and being kind of left out on our own.
53:28
We were a little bit on edge, I think, and very
53:33
emotionally and physically exhausted after that week.
53:37
And so, I think, there were folks who were like, "Hey, is there anything we
53:41
can do?" or whatever, but we didn't.
53:44
We were just tired.
53:47
And then, I, I mean there were definitely some that I remember.
53:51
There were folks that told me that
53:56
I was making a mistake, because I want to go into student affairs.
54:01
I work in student affairs.
54:02
I want to continue to.
54:04
And so, there were folks that told me that I was making a mistake and that I
54:09
was making decisions that would impact my career, and that I would not be
54:15
hired by OSU because I'm too radical.
54:19
And those conversations were, I mean at the time I shrugged them
54:25
off, but they have very real impact.
54:27
But, I think for me, what I tell myself and what I would tell students who
54:31
are doing social justice work and also wanted to go into student affairs, that
54:36
if you feel like or are told that you need to navigate a system in a work
54:43
environment or that you can't bring your experiences into a work environment,
54:47
that that's not somewhere that I would want to work, and that's what I just
54:52
keep in my mind and would tell anyone else who is doing social justice work:
54:58
is that there needs to be space for you to exist in all your identities,
55:04
wherever it is that your working.
55:07
And these people who are saying these things to me obviously are not
55:09
representative of the entire Oregon State community, but I think it speaks to
55:15
the culture that is among staff members here, that you have to assimilate.
55:20
And as student employees, we see staff members that we know, maybe
55:28
from personal work or that we know, as, just on a, on a more human basis, and we
55:34
see them assimilate and not be themselves to survive in a work environment, and
55:40
that is part of what we wanted to fight against and to work against, because it's
55:45
hard to not, to not be able, you know, to say, "these are the things that we
55:51
need as students" but also we see that staff members need these things too.
55:57
For sure.
56:00
[Laughs] I don't know if I'm allowed to agree with you or not.
56:03
Because part of me wants to.... We can cut this out.
56:05
I want to talk with you, but I know this is an oral history.
56:10
It's not a dialogue.
56:12
But anyway, so every time you say something I'm like [something off camera]
56:16
. I know!
56:16
I know!
56:17
You're over there [something off camera] . [Laughs]
56:19
Gonna cut that part out.
56:23
I only have a few more questions here.
56:29
Let's see, I know you mentioned that The Barometer decentered
56:35
students of color.
56:37
Were there any other ways that the university did that after the
56:43
Speak Out, or was that really the only event that you're aware of?
56:50
So, the other, I mean,
56:56
the other part of it too was that I...
57:02
what?
57:04
Was that I, I was getting ready to graduate, you know?
57:08
Where I was on my way out and Haniya
57:13
and Jasmine had a little bit longer in their careers here at Oregon State.
57:19
And so, I think my experiences as far as what the conversations that I was
57:24
having with staff and administration and such were a little bit different.
57:31
What was the question again?
57:33
Were there any other ways that students of color were decentered?
57:39
I mean, I can only speak from my experience and my awareness, not what
57:44
the students of color felt at that time, but I think that there definitely was a
57:55
sort of....
58:01
I felt like, how I perceived it was that faculty and staff, specifically
58:08
staff within Diversity and Cultural Engagement, continually used me as
58:12
an avenue to get to or talk about Haniya and Jasmine, or us as a group.
58:20
And so, when the Students of Color Speak Out was happening, I was just kind of
58:27
also starting my coming out process.
58:30
And prior to coming out, I definitely was a very safe person for staff
58:39
to, kind of, bring into a space or to use as a representative.
58:45
So, I, there were situations when I called out staff when they asked me to
58:53
speak in a space, or whatever, you know?
58:56
I recognize that you're asking me to speak here because I'm a
58:59
safe looking person for people to listen to and feel comfortable with.
59:06
After I came out, I kind of threw some of that out the window and stopped hiding
59:13
some of, well, I mean, being authentic in myself meant that I wasn't censoring
59:19
my radical views or opinions either.
59:22
And so that, some of that definitely changed in the way that
59:26
I felt like staff talked to me.
59:30
And, you know, I definitely had staff within DCE and other departments on campus
59:36
that, you know would contact me and be like, "Can you, Haniya and Jasmine, you
59:40
know?" and I'm just like, " Well why aren't you contacting us all together?"
59:44
or, you know, something like that, or students saying, "Oh, hey, can you
59:54
talk about the speak out for this thing?", and I'm like, "Well we can talk about
59:56
the speak out for this thing." You know?
59:58
And just little things, and I say little.... [[] [Video cut]
1:00:03
Describe the current campus climate.
1:00:05
Is it different than it was two years ago?
1:00:09
So, I've been away from campus for most of this year, since I graduated
1:00:16
last June, so I'll describe it as I left it, as it was when I left.
1:00:22
But I think that, since the Speak Out, there definitely are more conversations.
1:00:28
If you work on campus, if you're involved in social justice work, you
1:00:32
definitely are hearing more conversations about changes, things that are coming.
1:00:38
But as far as the campus climate in general, from a student's perspective,
1:00:42
I don't think that it has changed much, except for the fact of the impact
1:00:48
that the election has had on it, and with people who are hateful and who
1:00:55
regularly practice discrimination, feel more openly able and safe to do so.
1:01:02
And so, I think that there is that [[] impact.
1:01:04
But I think that generally, the campus climate is built on a lot of
1:01:08
apathy and on a lot of ignorance.
1:01:10
So most students, I mean most students are white and most of them can go
1:01:14
through out their days still without ever having to think about that and
1:01:18
without it impacting them in any way.
1:01:20
So I think that there's still a lot of apathy and just, you know, "Well it's
1:01:27
not my issue to deal with," or something like that, and I think there's also
1:01:30
a lot of, "Well someone else is going take care of it." And what that means
1:01:35
is that students of color are going to continue to have to do the work.
1:01:39
So I think that, in that sense, the campus climate is similar, but I
1:01:44
think that, from my perspective, the Speak Out did allow the folks who work
1:01:49
in social justice to feel a little bit more empowered and connected.
1:01:54
And also, it was a big learning process for a lot of us, so, yeah.
1:02:01
Thank you.
1:02:03
So my final question for you is, do you have any parting advice for future viewers
1:02:10
or students who are watching this video?
1:02:12
Yeah!
1:02:13
Or trying to navigate being at OSU?
1:02:15
[Laughs] That's a word, yes.
1:02:18
Navigate.
1:02:19
I think for students who are finding themselves,
1:02:26
for students who are at OSU and who are wanting to do social justice
1:02:30
work, diversity work, or who are just wanting to survive and be in a safe
1:02:35
environment, I think that some advice that I would have definitely is utilizing
1:02:42
the things that do exist already, so, like the cultural resource centers,
1:02:45
even if they themselves are still working to being a really safe and
1:02:53
an environment that actually supports students in the work that they are doing.
1:02:57
But the people that are there, the other students, is the main advice that
1:03:02
I would give is to connect with them.
1:03:04
And to see what ways you can get involved in a way that makes sense for you,
1:03:08
and also finding the places on campus or the people on campus where you can
1:03:15
re-energize, and who you can spend time with that re-fuels you, especially
1:03:20
because social justice and diversity work on campus is extremely tiring,
1:03:26
even more so when you are someone who has a targeted identity and who is
1:03:30
trying to do work from that place of still experiencing oppression every day.
1:03:35
So when you're doing that, it's really important that you find whatever it is or
1:03:38
whoever it is that you need to re-energize yourself and take care of yourself.
1:03:43
And, I would say, you'll hear a lot of things like the word "navigate." You
1:03:49
know, a lot of people who are like, "Well, you need to learn how to navigate
1:03:52
the system," etc. And I think what I wish I would have known or someone
1:03:57
would have told me is just to stay true to myself and to really allow space
1:04:02
to understand how I feel and what I believe to be true and use that more
1:04:07
so to navigate rather than, off, basing it off of what other people say is the
1:04:13
professional or the acceptable thing to do, finding a balance between living your
1:04:18
truth and existing in a place like OSU.
1:04:22
Thank you!
1:04:22
Yeah!
1:04:24
I have no more questions for you.
1:04:28
That wraps up your oral history, and I appreciate you!
