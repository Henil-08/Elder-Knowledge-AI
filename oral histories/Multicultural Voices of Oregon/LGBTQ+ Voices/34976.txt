Natalia Fernández: Today’s date is January 29th, 2020.
00:06
And my name is Natalia Fernández.
00:09
This is an oral history interview with Professor Mina Carson in Corvallis,
00:13
Oregon, for the OSU History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:19
American oral history project.
00:21
Now, the focus of this interview would be to explore the history of the Oregon
00:26
State University course, History 368 Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern
00:31
American, which you currently teach.
00:33
So to begin the interview, could you please state your
00:35
name, and spell it out loud?
00:37
Mina Carson, M-I-N-A C-A-R-S-O-N.
00:41
And please share which pronouns you use.
00:43
She and her.
00:45
Wonderful.
00:47
So, to get started, can we talk about the current course, the course as it is?
00:52
Could you please describe the course as you currently teach it?
00:55
I teach it as —and I know we’ll circle back to this—queer
01:01
history and the history of
01:06
self-identified queer people, queer movements in the United States.
01:11
Again, we’ll talk about this, but it’s changed enormously over time.
01:15
So that when I named it with a colleague 25 years ago, we thought
01:20
“Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States” was pretty up to date.
01:26
At the time—and still—my focus is on talking about LGBTQ+
01:38
subjects as having agency as being the commanders of their own fate.
01:47
As we—and I said this to the class the first day—look at oppression, we
01:52
look at pain, we look at solitude and tragedy, but this is part of many lives
02:00
and we really look at movements, at self-identification, at pushbacks and
02:07
reactions to other people’s identification of queer subjects, and so on.
02:12
Really, I think that the emphasis is really on self-identified
02:18
queer persons as subjects and as agents, and as communities.
02:25
What types of readings do you assign?
02:27
That’s changed a lot over the years too.
02:30
And now, trying to respect the financial challenges of being a
02:36
college student, at this point I’m not requiring the purchase of any books.
02:41
And because the library has digitized so effectively, I can share book chapters
02:50
and articles, and newspaper reports, magazine articles, things like that.
02:57
I pull some scholarly articles.
03:01
I also pull some book chapters from the whole of which I’ve used in the past.
03:06
Then I try to pull newspaper and magazine articles.
03:10
I kind of slot them in as they become relevant.
03:14
If I see something in the news, I’ll pull that and put a link in an announcement.
03:19
Is the course structured chronologically or thematically?
03:23
That’s a really good question.
03:25
It’s more or less chronological.
03:27
But the other thing that’s happened, in terms of the material, is there’s been an
03:30
explosion of available video materials.
03:34
And now the videos are available to students and faculty with an OSU ID card.
03:41
So, we use Kanopy almost exclusively.
03:43
When I have a movie to show that’s not in Kanopy, I’ll generally show it in class.
03:49
And we show significant pieces of videos in class.
03:53
I’ve had some pushback in the past, maybe too much time.
03:56
But I love it as material.
03:59
And then we can talk about the videos.
04:02
In class, I don’t use many fiction films.
04:05
I make them available to students to choose in some of their free-choice stuff.
04:09
But I generally don’t use fiction films in this class because
04:13
the documentaries are so great.
04:15
So really, I would say that the materials that students use now are
04:23
divided almost half-half between readings and videos, because the video
04:31
library now is so huge and accessible.
04:35
And currently, what types of in-class activities and discussions do you have?
04:39
What I try to do is start with a question that they’ve had for
04:44
discussion, the previous week for a written discussion, or try to connect
04:52
a question I come in with to a question that we closed with the time before.
04:58
The particular class I’m teaching right now is full of people who are very
05:03
willing to share and I’m very grateful.
05:05
I’ve had them break up in groups just once, maybe twice, but they’re so willing
05:13
to share in a group with each other.
05:16
And the size of the course is so moderate—we’re 18 or 19 people at
05:20
most—that we’ve had free-for-alls.
05:24
And I try to make sure that everyone gets heard in a free-for-all.
05:28
I’m not always successful.
05:29
And
05:32
I try to leave—because the videos are now so available now on Kanopy—a few
05:41
minutes at the end so we can touch back on what we’ve seen in class.
05:44
I don’t always succeed in doing that.
05:46
We often have to carry over to the next session.
05:52
In this class, I lecture very little, because the materials
05:58
are so rich and I love the live perspectives that people bring.
06:03
And also in this topic, as in another course I teach, students bring as
06:10
much as experiential knowledge of the culture as I have, more usually.
06:15
So, I like to access that.
06:18
And what types of course assignments do you have the students work on?
06:23
Short readings and videos, and then multiple written discussions.
06:32
And then since you and I have been working together, many of their written
06:37
assignments, or their experiential assignments, have to do with accommodating
06:42
a project of the oral history.
06:45
How long have you been teaching the course?
06:47
About 25 years, I think.
06:51
This a classic example of what I say to the students and they’re discovering—is
06:56
that people have memories that’re sometimes nonlinear, a little bit
07:01
flawed, perhaps they have holes in them.
07:05
This is a great example of my going through all of the materials that
07:09
I can access, going through all my files—I have no paper files, going
07:15
through all my Google Drive, Box, etc. and finding exactly one document that
07:25
relates to the past of the course.
07:29
So, I’m relying on my memory and my bookshelf, because I was able to
07:33
pull some books that we used to use.
07:36
And that has prompted in some of my memories about what we do in the course.
07:40
Craig Machado
07:44
was an instructor in English in the 90s here at OSU.
07:52
We had met, probably—I’m not sure how, but I think—either through After 8,
08:01
the political organization here locally working on what we then called lesbian and
08:07
gay issues, or through a campus student group, through being in an event or as
08:15
advisors to the campus student group.
08:17
And that’s changed names a lot of times over the 25 years—over the 30
08:22
years I’ve been here and 25 years since I’ve been teaching the course.
08:27
It was Craig’s idea that we should create a course and now, I cannot
08:32
remember if we cross-listed it.
08:33
I know we made it a special-topics in history initially.
08:37
And it was only several years later that I did the curricular
08:46
application to have a regular number.
08:52
But when Craig and I first taught it,
08:56
I can’t even remember if we had one class.
08:58
I think we did have one class that was solely on campus OSU students.
09:04
But the one that I remember which was a circus—not in a very bad way, but in
09:10
a crazy way—was in the early years of what we now call Ecampus, very early
09:17
years of what we now call Ecampus.
09:19
We had
09:23
a cameraman who was handling all the video stuff.
09:27
And we had students who were in Newport.
09:34
I don’t even know if they were in Bend.
09:36
They were in several pods, little campuses, around the state.
09:42
And we had a video feed from each classroom, plus the classroom at OSU.
09:49
This was an evening class so we had three hours.
09:53
It was crazy.
09:54
It was just crazy.
09:55
And I just think we were very energetic to attempt such a thing in the
10:00
days of—what we now would think of as—fairly primitive video equipment.
10:05
Oh my gosh.
10:06
And
10:09
that was wild.
10:10
But we had participations from all these different classrooms and we’d say,
10:13
“Newport, Newport, what do you think about this?” And they would speak up.
10:16
And there would be a sound delay.
10:18
But we could see this sort of video image.
10:20
Again, then
10:23
it was difficult to get good video.
10:27
We’re talking mid-90s.
10:29
So, it was difficult to get good video,
10:34
good movies to show.
10:35
But we did.
10:36
We showed a few films, and pieces of films.
10:38
And we’d have discussions about those.
10:40
But, wow.
10:42
That was wild.
10:43
And then by
10:47
2000, I think, Craig had gotten a job in Connecticut.
10:52
So, he left campus.
10:53
And I carried on the course by myself.
10:56
I’m not sure when it was that I was able to put it through the curricular
11:01
process and rename it History
11:05
368.
11:05
With Craig, you were co-teaching those early years?
11:08
Yeah, we were co-teaching, absolutely.
11:10
There
11:13
was a gay man and a lesbian woman, and we were co-teaching lesbian and
11:16
gay movements in the United States.
11:18
It was like, “Well, we’ve got the ground covered.” And of course, it shows you
11:22
how things have changed over the years.
11:25
Going back a little bit to the beginnings, in terms of the course development,
11:30
was there pushback or support from your colleagues and administration at the time?
11:36
There was support.
11:36
These characters are going to hear this from me a lot,
11:38
the people in the class now.
11:42
As far as I remember, there was only support.
11:46
And we developed this course during the years of the ballot
11:50
measures, during the years of the Oregon Citizens Alliance and their
11:59
fervid campaigns to oppress people who they identify as lesbian and gay, queer.
12:07
And
12:10
of course, we were teaching in the College of Liberal Arts.
12:13
But I don’t remember particular pushback from anywhere on campus.
12:17
I don’t know why there would have been from other colleges.
12:20
But
12:24
no, it was full steam ahead basically, as far as I remember.
12:29
I’m maybe cleaning up my memory, but that’s what I remember.
12:33
So the sociopolitical climate at the time in Oregon was
12:38
very anti-LGBT in some cases.
12:41
But at the university, people were trying to fight back?
12:44
Yeah.
12:45
And in Corvallis, in Eugene, in Portland, you can gas up and down in the
12:49
Willamette Valley, with some exceptions.
12:51
But we had strong advocates for civil rights in Albany as well.
12:58
I learned a lot about not
13:03
characterizing smaller towns or towns around.
13:07
Yeah, opposition to gay civil rights tended to be in Springfield rather than
13:17
Eugene, and Albany rather than Corvallis.
13:19
But those generalizations, by and large or not, are not fair to the climate.
13:29
It was interesting that, I think, when we tallied up, you could
13:35
imagine that election night those years was pretty exciting.
13:40
The After 8 people had
13:45
teamed up with the Democratic Party.
13:46
They were very strongly anti-ballot measure.
13:49
So, we teamed up with them, and then much of our election night celebration.
13:54
I remember one year, we were down in the Old World Deli which is down on 2nd St.
14:03
And we had the TV on.
14:04
And we were just waiting for the returns to come in.
14:09
It was quite clear early on that the measures have been defeated.
14:13
But we were interested to know, I believe, that the “no” votes that is
14:22
against the measures were higher in Corvallis, percentage wise, than they
14:26
were in Portland. I mean, Corvallis has been, for some decades, a fairly strong
14:35
pro-civil-rights
14:39
town with significant lesbian population, smaller population of gay men, for various
14:46
reasons that we don’t have to go in to.
14:49
In the early years of the course, you were not only talking
14:52
about the history, but you were incorporating contemporary events?
14:55
You were discussing that with the students?
14:56
Absolutely.
15:00
It was challenging for me because—people may not believe—I tend to either be
15:08
very, very private, or overshared.
15:10
I don’t tend to be
15:13
in a happy medium very easily.
15:14
[Laughs] And it’s always been.
15:16
And I grew up in a time when this was a difficult identity to own.
15:22
So, it took me several decades to come out, less to myself than to others.
15:28
I mean, I came out to myself and it was like “Uh-oh.”
15:31
So,
15:41
I continue to be anxious about coming out, today, in 2020.
15:43
So it was, to me, always quite challenging to teach this course because, as I said to
15:50
the current class, nobody is required to own or present an identity in this class.
15:56
All identities are welcomed.
15:58
All self-disclosure is welcomed and certainly not required.
16:03
I’ve tried to conduct the course that way over the decades.
16:08
But that meant that I’ve made varying decisions, I think, in varying instances
16:14
of the course, whether I came out or not.
16:17
I think usually I have come out, partly because we originated the course in
16:22
the years of the ballot measures, which lasted all the way from ‘92 through
16:26
2001—I think was the most recent one.
16:30
That was a long decade.
16:32
And
16:35
of course, I’ve been somewhat active in town.
16:38
So, I felt
16:42
awkward in outing myself to students, and yet, feeling that it was simply
16:49
wrong not to—that culturally, that personally, that emotionally,
16:54
psychologically, it was important for students to know that there were queer
16:59
faculty people who’re willing to be out.
17:07
At that time, I was partnered.
17:09
And my partner and I were raising children.
17:11
And at one point, we were on the front page of the GT.
17:14
So, we couldn’t have been closeted, you know.
17:19
[Laughs]
17:19
Is this something that you and Craig discussed in those early years?
17:22
I can’t remember.
17:25
But I think Craig was out.
17:29
This is my memory—I think that with Craig out, and with my being one of the
17:34
advisors to the LGBT group at that time on campus, how would I not have been out?
17:41
But it still was always psychologically difficult for me, just saying.
17:49
And as part of the history of this course, it’s part of the
17:53
history of this culture on campus.
17:57
I think it would be incorrect, and somewhat wrong, of me not to acknowledge
18:03
the difficulty for me as now a mid-60-year-old person, not to acknowledge
18:10
how hard it has been for me to be out.
18:12
Note, a lot of my peers don’t have that same problem.
18:19
But at the same time, some of my peers who are my age or a little older still
18:26
don’t own the queer label, because we grew up with that as the thing
18:31
that was flung at us in a nasty way.
18:37
Of course, we’ve appropriated it as a movement.
18:38
We’ve appropriated that in a way, to speak politely, thumb our noses
18:48
at people who were nasty to us.
18:51
But it’s still difficult for some of my friends to use it, to own it.
18:58
That’s fine.
19:01
You’ve shared your reaction, how you felt.
19:03
Do you recall the initial student reaction to the course,
19:07
especially in those early years?
19:09
That’s a really good question.
19:16
I had a lot of fear about whether there would be students coming into the
19:21
class who wanted nothing more than to shut us down, to interfere, to bully.
19:32
And that did not happen.
19:34
That has not happened over the 25 years I’ve taught this course.
19:37
I’ve just been stunned and,
19:42
of course, delighted.
19:52
I think it is accurate to say—this is impressionistic, but I think accurate
19:57
to say—that over the years, even though the percentage of self-identified
20:06
queer people in the class versus, pretty much, self-identified
20:09
straight people has varied a lot.
20:14
I had a few years quite recently where it was mostly—not just mostly, but
20:20
MOSTLY—straight people in the class.
20:23
But
20:28
I think that what has happened—it’s been so thrilling to teach this
20:33
class over the last 25 years because the culture has moved so rapidly.
20:40
The queer culture has moved so rapidly.
20:43
And the surrounding culture has had so many blips.
20:48
It’s fascinating.
20:49
The sociology of all this is fascinating.
20:51
But it’s been so much fun to teach.
20:53
And in the classroom, students have been more and more relaxed.
20:58
I just don’t walk in anymore, fearing that there’s gonna be
21:02
people in the class who just want to
21:06
destroy the class.
21:08
I mean, it could still happen.
21:10
We’re in a very interesting, strange political moment.
21:13
And that could still happen, but it’s been less and less.
21:18
The first day, it becomes clear that that’s just not gonna happen.
21:23
Going back just a little bit to the development of the course, in the
21:28
early years when you were developing the course and teaching it, were
21:30
there other courses like this at other state or national universities?
21:36
Were you inspired or influenced by others when you and Craig were developing?
21:40
Do you remember that?
21:41
I think we were pretty
21:48
on.
21:49
I should have gone back onto the web to see what I can find about that.
21:56
Craig had come from the Bay Area.
21:59
And I would be shocked if there weren’t already courses in the San
22:05
Francisco Bay Area on queer history.
22:10
But I really think, as a regular thing we were—not so much in the
22:15
vanguard—but we were pretty early.
22:17
And then, of course, by
22:22
2000 it would have been unusual for the largest university that wasn’t
22:28
self-identified as conservative Christian not to have such a course.
22:33
It just has become very common.
22:40
We academics trailed women’s history a little bit with queer history.
22:44
But still, the burgeoning of those programs in the early 2000s—really, late
22:52
90s to early 2000s—were really remarkable.
22:56
In the early 90s, mid 90s, something else that was happening on campus was
23:01
the establishment of the Different, Power and Discrimination program.
23:06
Can you talk about that program briefly and its connection,
23:09
specifically, to this course?
23:14
One of my motivations for making 368 a regularly numbered course was to
23:18
get it into the DPD program, because it was so obviously a Different,
23:24
Power and Discrimination topic.
23:27
The
23:31
beauty of the DPD program is that it’s allowed a number of students
23:40
to take courses like this where they wouldn’t go out of their way to
23:46
seek it out as an elective because OSU students’ programs are so
23:50
ridiculously packed with requirements.
23:53
But because that’s become an option in a requirement, I think a lot of students
23:58
have found their way into the course.
24:00
More students have found their way into the course, I think, through
24:03
DPD than through the History major or minor, although it’s obviously
24:08
also an elective in those categories.
24:13
And then we have the further expansion—I’m jumping the gun a little—but we have
24:18
the further expansion of the course onto our flourishing Ecampus program.
24:25
And History now has a full major available online, as well a minor available online.
24:30
So,
24:36
368, sometimes I teach it twice a year online—always once, sometimes twice.
24:42
Again, it’s a great DPD option for people who’re taking a degree through Ecampus.
24:50
But also
24:53
because it’s a regular history course, it’s one that they can grab
24:56
and maybe even transfer back to another campus that they might be
25:01
taking their main requirements on.
25:03
You mentioned this briefly—over the 25 years, were you typically teaching
25:07
this course once an academic year?
25:10
And how about in-person versus online?
25:16
Since you and I have been working together in the oral history thing,
25:19
I think we’ve taught this annually, right, for the last four years?
25:22
Is that correct?
25:22
I think we skipped a year, but yes.
25:25
Oh yeah, that’s right.
25:26
I was away.
25:30
[Laughs] But I think before that, it was usually once
25:35
every other year on campus because of the rotation of courses that
25:39
most of us do as faculty members.
25:43
And I’m the only one who teaches that course right now.
25:46
So,
25:48
it was once other year, probably from about 2000 through 2014 or 2015.
25:57
But as soon as it was on Ecampus, I think I have taught it every
26:01
year on Ecampus, I think so.
26:04
And the class size tends to be in the 20-student range, you mentioned early?
26:09
Yeah.
26:10
Online now it tends to fill up and equal out at about 20, I think.
26:17
In the class, it could be anywhere from 15 to 30.
26:21
So, it’s a reasonably sized course.
26:24
I don’t think it’s dipped too much, before, below 15 in the classroom.
26:31
Is this the type of course that benefits from a class size that
26:34
ranges a little towards the smaller than the 40, or 50 or 80+ students?
26:39
Absolutely.
26:39
I think we have
26:42
a limit.
26:42
I think we limit at 30 or 35 in the classroom.
26:48
And that’s pretty common.
26:50
We’re very lucky and, frankly, smart in the History Department to do
26:56
that with our upper-level courses.
26:58
We’re lucky to be able to do that with most of them.
27:04
This course benefits so much from discussion in the classroom.
27:11
That is really the heart of the course.
27:14
My
27:17
students learn pretty quickly that I’m not much of a linear thinker, should we say.
27:22
So I’ve had a little pushback over the years— “well, you really should
27:27
lecture more. You should give us more material, etc.” And while I respect that,
27:35
I really value the give-and-take of classroom discussion.
27:43
Always I could structure it better.
27:46
It’s not one of my strengths as an instructor.
27:49
But in this course, it’s so valuable.
27:54
You’ve touched on a lot of things that have changed over time.
27:59
But over the years, can you share a little bit more about how the sociopolitical
28:05
climate of the time period, for example, the 90s, the 2000s, the 2010s, have
28:11
affected what you teach and how you teach?
28:22
There is such a strong interaction,
28:28
as a teacher—.
28:29
We’re so lucky in the university, those of us who do have this luck—those of
28:37
us who are on tenure streams or have good instructor relationships with
28:41
their units to teach for decades.
28:45
I’ve been here for 30 years.
28:47
I can’t imagine anything luckier than that.
28:50
So, when I talk about the sociopolitical climate and cultural climate, and how
28:56
that has affected my teaching, it’s hard to separate that from the changes
29:01
that take place in one’s life between one’s mid-30s and one’s mid-60s.
29:07
So, as I hit my mid-40s and got into my 50s, a lot of things that used to
29:13
make me nervous kind of fell away.
29:17
It was like, “Ok, if I haven’t got this by now, oh well.” So, you
29:22
begin to understand yourself, to know your strengths and weaknesses.
29:27
I’d like to think that I’m open to change.
29:30
But I also have had to understand that
29:39
I need to pull from my own strengths in the classroom,
29:42
in order to teach effectively.
29:45
It doesn’t always work, but it’s a nice philosophy.
29:51
Yeah, in terms of the sociopolitical climate, we had the years of the
29:57
ballot measures, and we had the years of the Lesbian Avengers.
30:04
Oh man, and I know that we’ll talk with this class much more
30:09
about those wonderful years.
30:14
We had Laramie, and the murder of—and of course I blocked him because it was so
30:21
horrifying, I was teaching at that time.
30:25
We had Ellen DeGeneres coming out on television.
30:29
We had Oregon’s—this was wonderful and horrifying—brief dip into
30:39
creating a gay marriage, and then their retreat from gay marriage.
30:46
Wow.
30:48
And then, of course, we had the federal decision that led to the right to marry.
30:58
We’ve had this explosion,
31:03
as I said, of scholarship, of popular literature, of videos, of fiction movies
31:10
and the changes in student culture which have dragged me along very happily.
31:18
They’ve dragged me
31:24
along.
31:25
Non-binary identities, trans identities.
31:29
It’s so embarrassing to say—but it’s really important of the sake of the
31:34
historical record—that it took me ages to understand that transgender
31:41
was not just some kind of casual thing that I can drop into the course
31:46
in half an hour and then move on.
31:49
That as that identity grew and became more complex and full in our culture,
31:57
that it had to grow and become more complex and full in the course as well.
32:03
As
32:06
I say, the course has really had to tumble forward with the culture.
32:10
And that’s been thrilling, and sometimes really embarrassing
32:14
for me—how slow I’ve been.
32:17
And again, it’s great to grow old.
32:20
No one would believe that, but it’s great to grow old.
32:23
But it’s also really stunning to realize how your own cultural, the
32:29
stuff that you grew up with, is hard to shed—that your assumptions, that your
32:34
politics, that everything you grew up with is sort of gone in the culture,
32:42
and yet hard to shed inside and in the person that you project to the world.
32:47
That’s a long answer!
32:49
Could you share a little bit more about, over the years, how the students have
32:54
changed, how they’ve impacted you, and how they’ve pushed you to adapt?
32:58
Yeah.
32:59
The Lesbian Avengers were great.
33:01
And I never did any fire-eating or fire-breathing.
33:05
I just realized at that point that the culture had definitely
33:10
passed me by in great ways.
33:16
Let’s see—I always get my timeframes wrong, but I think it’s really been
33:26
the last five years when I’ve been most challenged and shaken up by my students’
33:34
openness, by their challenges to me, which have been compassionate and good,
33:43
by their willingness to talk with each other.
33:45
And again, it’s so fun to teach this course online because even
33:49
more than in the classroom, people write about their lives.
33:54
They write back and forth to each other about their lives.
33:58
It’s so cool to learn from that, to learn how complicated people’s lives have been.
34:05
Let me give you some examples.
34:06
I’ve had several people, over the years, who’ve been in the military.
34:11
One guy told me—and this was, woah, at least ten years ago, but it stays in my
34:19
mind, feels like yesterday—they have, I
34:27
guess, uniform day, is it Thursday when ROTC candidates
34:31
wear their uniforms to class?
34:33
It’s one of the days of the week.
34:36
And of course, he would do that.
34:37
He was very, very identified with the military.
34:41
And he told me at one point that he could not
34:48
talk at all about any of his opinions in class that differed from military policy.
34:54
And I thought, I’m not sure that’s accurate.
34:56
I did not say to him “I’m not sure that’s accurate” because
35:01
that would not have been—.
35:02
[Laughs]
35:03
So, we had to negotiate that relationship in class.
35:07
And I had to be aware that I needed to help other students negotiate their
35:13
relationship with this young man.
35:15
Yet at the same time,
35:19
he did not come into the course to challenge it.
35:22
He did not come into the course to destroy it.
35:24
He just believed what he believed and told me that he couldn’t really
35:30
talk about or say any opinions that differed from the military.
35:34
And of course, this was—I believe—probably in the Clinton years, so the “Don’t ask.
35:39
Don’t tell” years.
35:41
Then another year, much more recently, I had a veteran, I think identified with
35:50
she/her pronouns, of the military who talked with me extensively about her
35:55
family situation and shared with the class
36:01
the experiences that she and her partner had had in the military
36:06
and how challenging it had been to get services afterward and so on.
36:15
The military people who have owned their relationship with the military in class
36:21
because I’m sure that people have come through and not said, “oh by the way,
36:24
I’m a veteran”, or “by the way, I’m an active military member.” But those who
36:29
have shared have really added a great deal to the class, in terms of our being aware
36:34
of the complexities of that relationship.
36:41
Have you experienced, in some cases, students having transformative
36:45
experiences in the class, can you recall bad or—not that that’s the point of
36:51
the course necessarily—in some cases they learning about these people’s
36:56
lives and the community history?
36:58
Has that occurred?
37:00
I think so.
37:00
And I think I’ve gotten those statements much more often from Ecampus, although
37:06
now I’ve incorporated the farewell as well as the introduction in class as well.
37:12
And there’s where I tend to get those statements.
37:16
It was like, “Wow, I didn’t know this.” And often—I would say 10 to 20 percent,
37:27
that may be a little high—people will take the class, who don’t necessarily
37:31
identify as queer but they’ll have family members or best friends, or
37:39
knew people in high school, or rooming with someone who identifies as queer.
37:47
And they want to understand it more.
37:54
I think there have been kind of transformative experiences.
37:58
I think that mainly what’s happened, especially in earlier years, is
38:04
people have come away not just with more knowledge of the history,
38:09
but maybe less anxious about
38:15
how do I understand
38:19
LGBTQ people if I’m straight, or if I think of myself as straight.
38:24
And then they’re questioning people who have taken it over the years.
38:27
And I can’t recall enough like, “Oh phew, now I know that I’m queer.”
38:34
[Laughs] But I think that’s been another part of the population.
38:39
You’ve talked a lot about your teaching philosophy already, but can you share
38:45
a little bit more how your personal experiences and identities have shaped
38:50
the way you teach, and how the course has impacted your life personally?
38:55
Yeah, and I hope I’m representing what my students have experienced.
39:03
But I want to be, I strive to be, I have to be—and when I fail, I feel
39:11
miserable—as inclusive as possible, as open as possible, make people comfortable
39:17
in talking with me and with each other.
39:21
There’ve been awkward moments over the years but that’s how teaching goes.
39:25
People will kind of come into a little conflict with each other and then I
39:28
have to calm it down and handle it.
39:32
And I’m as conflict-diverse a person as you will ever meet, I’m afraid.
39:38
So that’s challenging.
39:41
But my aim is to create a course where, to be honest—and I guess it’s good for
39:48
my students to know this—if you complete the assignments with as much honesty and
39:57
openness, and seriousness as you can, you can get an A. If you come to class, if you
40:02
participate in the class by being here, if you do the assignments, and if you’re open
40:09
and honest in your interaction with the material, you’ll walk out with an A, and
40:14
hopefully with a few other things as well.
40:18
And I teach courses in which—because I’m passionate about these courses and the
40:23
material—that’s usually the case, that if students interact with the course
40:31
on a consistent basis, they get an A.
40:43
[Laughs]
40:44
Some people may experience the course as not sufficiently rigorous.
40:51
But it’s been my aim to open dialogue and to allow people to ask questions
41:00
of themselves as well as each other.
41:03
And now that I’m working with you, they also walk out with mad
41:08
skills in conducting interviews and thinking about what they got.
41:13
And your teaching philosophy—especially this is a history course, but because
41:18
a wide range of students in different majors can take it—do you also find
41:22
that you have to slightly adapt?
41:24
If it were just a course specifically for History majors, make it more
41:27
open and more about discussion?
41:30
Oh that’s a good question!
41:31
Not very much.
41:36
Those students who are WGSS, for example, or sociology or
41:41
anthropology, will find really there’s a paucity of theory in my class.
41:46
I’m not very theory oriented.
41:49
So,
41:53
I rarely add that in.
41:54
I’d try to give them a little bit of historiography, you know,
41:57
who’s written about this and when and why, and how that’s changed.
42:01
But no, this tends to be interdisciplinary only in its openness
42:07
to the different kinds of materials.
42:10
Maybe if I were teaching it as a graduate course, it would be very different because
42:15
we would use more written material.
42:17
We would look at more of the historiography.
42:19
We would examine the scholarly sources.
42:23
Because it’s an undergraduate course—not because I think that these students
42:27
are not capable of that, but because there is such a rich universe of
42:32
multiple kinds of material—I don’t find that the best use of our time.
42:37
So, I’ve had them examine several—.
42:39
One ongoing theme is the sources, partly because we get to work with you.
42:46
And they’re creating, now, primary sources, which is awesome.
42:50
So we look at sources.
42:51
We look at problematic sources in this history.
42:55
And I have them analyze those problematic sources.
42:58
And frankly, mostly they do a better job than I do, which is
43:02
partly why I make them do it.
43:04
I get the benefit.
43:06
But no, I don’t think I would teach it differently if it
43:08
were mostly history students.
43:10
No.
43:12
Over the years talking about the sources that you’ve picked, because you’ve
43:15
expressed that there has been such an explosion of scholarship and so many
43:20
more people sharing their stories.
43:22
Over the years, have you had to adapt and choose different sources for the students—
43:28
Yeah.
43:28
How has that worked?
43:29
Because I’m sure you can’t include everything.
43:32
No.
43:32
I don’t want to say I’ve given up, but the pressure of the sources,
43:38
combined with the pressure of student finances, has really pushed me in
43:42
the direction of using excerpts.
43:44
I used to make people read entire books, and I suspect they didn’t do it.
43:50
But I had, for example—and they’re older sources—I used Eric Marcus's
43:55
Making Gay History for a long time.
43:57
It’s a wonderful book that is largely oral histories transcribed.
44:04
Fabulous stuff.
44:06
And in fact, what I need to do is make a bibliography of the stuff I used to use.
44:11
But you can see it’s an older—Making Gay History.
44:15
Eric Marcus is a wonderful scholar.
44:17
The subtitle’s The Half Century Fight for Lesbian and Gay Equal Rights.
44:22
I used to make them read the whole thing.
44:23
Then I made them read excerpts.
44:25
Now it’s like, “Well I’ve move onto different sources.”
44:28
Another fabulous source that I used for a while—again, it was an amazing
44:37
collection of primary sources—was an exhibit catalog that was put together
44:44
at the Boston Public Library, foreword by Barney Frank, oh my heavens.
44:48
Complied by the history project, Lesbian and Gay History from
44:51
the Puritans to Playland, and it’s called Improper Bostonians.
44:55
It went out of print.
44:57
It went out of print!
44:58
I would still use it today!
45:00
Fabulous photographs.
45:02
In fact, I need to keep it.
45:03
I have three copies and I need to bring them to class one time and
45:07
just let people play around with them and pass them around, and so on.
45:13
I used to use that.
45:14
So, some stuff has gone out of print.
45:16
For years, I used Leila Rupp.
45:17
And I still use Leila Rupp in the Ecampus
45:22
course because they don’t do the oral histories.
45:26
So, the materials I use in Ecampus are a little bit fuller.
45:29
And they don’t have the classroom time.
45:31
So, I make them read more.
45:33
But they also watch lots of video.
45:35
A Desired Past: A Short History of Same-Sex Love in America—this is
45:43
getting a little long in the tooth.
45:44
This is 1999.
45:46
This is 20 years old.
45:53
The landscape has changed.
45:57
She writes
46:00
for undergraduates which means for a smart general readership.
46:04
And that’s what I loved.
46:05
And she uses “I”.
46:07
She uses her own voice in here.
46:09
So, I love it.
46:10
It’s a very good introduction to a periodization of queer
46:15
history in the United States.
46:18
And then finally, I used to make people read the entire book of Wide-Open
46:24
Town: A History of Queer San Francisco.
46:26
And again, before you and I started working together and the oral history
46:30
project became so major, this is a book that I assigned because San
46:35
Francisco was a big thread running through the course for good reason.
46:41
Because San Francisco was really a mega—and we will still talk about
46:46
San Francisco in this course—place for gay history in the United States.
46:55
So that’s just some of the stuff.
46:57
I used to use whole books.
47:02
The primary source stuff that we would use was in books.
47:06
So that’s sort of an answer to that.
47:10
You’ve touched upon this already several times, but can you describe a little
47:14
bit more about how teaching the course online differs from teaching it in person?
47:19
Right.
47:22
The materials are different, the activities are different because of
47:24
our strong dedication to the oral history project in the campus course.
47:32
So, the materials are different.
47:36
The structure is not very different, actually.
47:39
They do, as I say, more reading.
47:41
Because
47:43
it’s so easy to do this, I do require more Kanopy viewing.
47:47
And I give some free-choice assignments in the Kanopy viewing.
47:51
The discussion
47:55
segment is at least weekly.
47:59
And they have a requirement to respond to each other.
48:01
It’s something that I should always do on campus too and I
48:04
sometimes just don’t write that in.
48:08
Especially for Ecampus, this is really important because they don’t have any
48:10
other way to interact with each other.
48:12
Once they start interacting, wow, the whole universe opens up.
48:17
So that’s a little different.
48:20
And again, I teach several courses.
48:22
I teach a course in history of psychotherapy and I teach a
48:25
course in popular music which is very much geared to individual’s
48:31
interaction with popular music.
48:34
I teach a lot of what I should call “confessional courses” where individual
48:40
experience really enters into the course. And that is really effective online. I
48:45
think it’s effective online partly because people are pretty safe, they are online,
48:51
and Canvas builds pretty good walls around the outside world and the Canvas courses.
48:58
So, they can say things that they might not say to each other face to face.
49:05
And again, I always say “we’re all gonna be nice to each other!”.
49:11
And I don’t have to say that.
49:13
People are always generous with each other.
49:18
It’s nice.
49:18
So you found that, both in class and online, people have been able
49:21
to discuss challenging topics, talk about themselves if they so choose.
49:26
In both cases that’s been
49:31
the same?
49:32
Yeah.
49:32
It’s been extraordinary.
49:34
I will add in that I trained as a clinical social worker and in the ‘90s
49:40
as well, as I was here at the university.
49:43
And I was working on the history of psychotherapy and I thought, “Need
49:46
a clinical credential.” And while I do not act as a clinician with
49:50
my students because that would be wildly inappropriate, I think that
49:56
my awareness of PTSD and identity challenges and all those kinds of things
50:03
may also inform the way that I teach.
50:08
And again, I want to emphasize I do not do clinical work on
50:11
campus or with my students.
50:13
Woah, that would not be ok.
50:15
But you’ve mentioned that your style is less lecture-based and more a
50:20
facilitator of conversation which you could characterize yourself that way.
50:24
Yeah.
50:25
That’s always been the case in your teaching?
50:28
Not when I began.
50:31
When I began 35 years ago in Missouri, I was very lecture based because I
50:38
had come out of graduate school and we heard lectures and we had seminars.
50:43
So, I had lectures and I had seminars.
50:45
That’s what I started out with.
50:47
And over the years it’s like, “well, throw those notes out”.
50:51
Then we had PowerPoint.
50:54
This is so embarrassing to say, but PowerPoint has emerged, like
50:59
the Internet, during my career.
51:02
[Laughs]
51:05
People of my generation, all of our teaching has changed in response
51:11
to these wonderful technologies.
51:15
I’ve done much more interaction and gotten much looser in my presentation
51:20
of material over the years.
51:24
Talking a little bit about overall impressions, you’ve shared some of
51:27
your memories, but are there any experiences that you had that you
51:32
were called being challenging both personally or professionally for you?
51:42
It remains the case that every time I walk into a classroom, at least
51:48
the first week, I have stage fright.
51:51
That is always challenging.
51:57
Handling things like
52:03
the ballot measures, the lynchings, the murders, and
52:10
disappointment about Oregon’s retreat from gay marriage which
52:14
affected me personally, dramatically.
52:21
That’s been difficult.
52:23
I’m not always sure when I’m going to become emotional in class.
52:32
I’m not always sure it’s a bad idea but it makes you feel awkward.
52:36
I
52:41
don’t have specific memories.
52:43
I just know that teaching is like walking a tightrope for me.
52:48
I don’t think I give off that impression, but truthfully it is.
52:56
That’s what I remember as being challenging teaching.
53:01
What about some of your fondest memories teaching the course?
53:06
My current class will be among my fondest memories.
53:09
I don’t just say that because they’re sitting here with us.
53:15
But wow.
53:16
And you and I have had some really great groups over the few years
53:21
that we’ve taught the course.
53:27
Yeah, I think doing oral history project will be my fondest memory, really.
53:41
[Laughs] Okay, this is a little geeky, but when OSU subscribed to Kanopy and
53:49
I started going through the list of stuff, and it’s like, “Oh my god, it’s
53:53
Christmas morning!”—to be a little
53:59
inappropriate— “Oh my god, this is great!”
54:07
The wildly explosive availability of stuff that we could use, that’s just been great.
54:21
The Supreme Court decision that allowed gay marriage,
54:29
Ellen DeGeneres coming out of the closet on TV,
54:36
those moments that you walk back into the class and you
54:39
say, “Wow! Look what happened!”
54:47
Thinking about plans for the future, you briefly talked
54:50
about this at the beginning.
54:52
The name of the course, Lesbian and Gay Movements in Modern America,
54:57
would you like to see the name changed, and if so, to what?
55:01
Yes.
55:03
And I think as you asked that and as I looked at the question, I thought
55:06
what I’ll do is make these guys that I’m teaching right now write down
55:12
their favorite names for the class.
55:14
Then I have more material to work from.
55:18
My notion is to make it match the queer archive, say, queer
55:22
history of the United States.
55:24
And that would be fun too, isn’t it, queer history?
55:31
Well, we could do LGBTQ, but then it’ll be LGBTQ+++, LGBTQQ+.
55:37
I mean, that would change all the time anyway.
55:39
So, I’ve come
55:44
to love the term queers, embracing this huge spectrum, or universe,
55:49
of identities and thoughts.
55:51
That’s
55:54
what I would probably rename it to.
55:56
I have to rename it because it’s just long in the tooth.
56:00
Oh my gosh, it’s just wrong.
56:03
“No, we’re talking about trans people. We’re not talking about non-binary.
56:07
Because it says lesbian and gay movements.” It’s just wrong.
56:11
So that’s what I was—something queer.
56:17
What happens when you retire?
56:19
What are your hopes for the future of the course?
56:21
Well, I’ll keep teaching online as long as my unit hires me to do that.
56:31
And that’s once or twice a year.
56:37
The Ecampus is responsive to enrollment.
56:40
So as long as we can fill up the class so that—frankly, it’s a financial
56:48
thing—we can break even in teaching it.
56:52
And then they’re paying for instruction and support and so on.
56:56
Then it’ll continue to be taught.
57:00
I feel sad about leaving behind the oral history part.
57:03
As
57:10
we speak to each other in early 2020, we’re concluding a search among the
57:15
History faculty for a public historian.
57:17
It’s
57:22
very likely that person will be working with you.
57:24
It’s a little less likely that they’ll be working on queer oral
57:27
history, although they may well.
57:29
I have no idea if one of the candidates, or a candidate in the future, will
57:33
teach the course in the classroom.
57:35
The beauty of the way that OSU does things—and I think this
57:38
is true pretty much among all universities—is we individual
57:42
instructors don’t own the course.
57:44
The university owns the course.
57:45
So, another instructor can be assigned to do the course.
57:51
I hope it persists.
57:54
I just don’t know.
57:55
So as long as you’re able, you hope to keep teaching it online if
57:59
you’re not physically in Corvallis?
58:01
Yeah, that’s my hope.
58:04
And changing the course name, could that happen within the next couple of years?
58:08
I should do that now.
58:09
I’ll see what the immediate future of the course—I have written the course recently.
58:14
So, it has been redeveloped.
58:16
I mean I’ve offered it on campus for years, but I did redevelop
58:19
it formally and technically with Ecampus for continued delivery.
58:24
And I didn’t change the name at that time.
58:26
So, I need to do the paperwork.
58:29
Well, that too boring but there’s reasons.
58:31
There’s things going on.
58:33
But—
58:33
But that’s your hope.
58:34
Yeah, that’s the hope.
58:36
Great.
58:38
Is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you’d like to share?
58:42
Or anything that we did discuss that you’d like to circle back
58:45
and talk a little bit more about?
58:47
I can’t think of anything.
58:52
Again, I tend to overshare.
58:54
I think I’ve pretty much shared all that I wanted to share and a good deal more.
58:59
So, no I don’t think of anything.
59:02
Ok great.
59:03
Thank you so much!
