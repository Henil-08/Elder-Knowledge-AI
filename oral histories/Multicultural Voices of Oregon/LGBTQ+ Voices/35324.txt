00:02
Okay, the verbal consent.
00:05
This interview’s being recorded as a component of classwork assigned for
00:08
the course, “The Hidden History of Women at Oregon State University.”
00:12
Once completed, the interview will be deposited into the permanent historical
00:16
record at the OSU Libraries Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:21
The interview will also be described with a biographical sketch, interview
00:25
abstract, and detailed index and made freely available to the public
00:28
through a dedicated web portal.
00:30
During the COVID-19 era, we are asking narrators to provide verbal consent rather
00:35
than signing paper permission forms.
00:37
Do you agree to allow this interview to be preserved, described, and made
00:41
freely available online as indicated?
00:45
Yes, I do.
00:46
I consent.
00:48
Cool.
00:50
Alright, before we get started with the questions can you give a
00:56
brief introduction to who you are?
00:59
Sure.
01:01
My name is Christina Walsh.
01:02
I serve the College of Agricultural Sciences as the
01:06
Student Engagement Coordinator.
01:08
I’ve been at OSU since August 2018, so just coming up on almost three
01:14
years at this point at the university.
01:20
The easiest place to start is at the beginning.
01:23
Can you talk a little bit about growing up and what life was like for you?
01:30
Like many folks, I have what I think of as a fairly rich, interesting
01:37
and complex childhood story.
01:40
I was born in Long Beach in the early ‘70s and my parents
01:46
were both from the East Coast.
01:48
My mother was from Brooklyn, New York.
01:50
My father was from a small town just north of Boston, Massachusetts.
01:54
I was born in Southern California because that’s where they met.
01:57
My father was a schoolteacher, elementary.
02:00
My mother was a housewife and a mother of six.
02:05
I was the youngest.
02:09
She was also a singer in the church choir, the solo soprano, a vocalist.
02:16
That was really her main focus in life.
02:20
As the youngest of six children, though, I primarily grew up with one sister.
02:25
The four oldest siblings were old enough that they pretty much aged-out
02:30
of living at home as I was growing up.
02:33
It was my sister and I, she’s a year older than me, who were
02:38
primarily growing up together.
02:42
Early on my mother had always wanted to move back to the east coast.
02:47
Even though she was from Brooklyn, my father’s family home, small
02:52
family home where he was born, was still in his possession at the time.
02:58
We actually moved back to Massachusetts when I was four years old and
03:01
spent three years living there and experiencing snow in the winter for
03:07
the first time and building snow forts and just having a pretty magical time.
03:14
I won’t go into all the details, but finances were always
03:17
complicated for my family.
03:19
My father wasn’t very strong in that area, made some poor decisions along the way.
03:26
Did his best, but it just wasn’t his strong suit.
03:29
Found ourselves moving back and forth several times while I was growing up,
03:34
trying to find the right place where my mother would be happy, where he could
03:38
make the finances work and my sister and I were kind of dragged around a lot.
03:44
Loved a lot of things about living on the east coast and also really
03:48
enjoyed being by the ocean, the Pacific, in southern California.
03:53
I was a total beach baby at the same time.
03:55
I had the best of both worlds in what I would describe as a fairly chaotic
04:00
and somewhat unstable childhood.
04:05
That kind of continued all the way through high school, moving back and forth, and
04:12
I would say that while I was in high school, mostly in southern California,
04:20
parents were still kind of struggling to make things work well in life in general.
04:28
So, I’m going to cap off this brief description of my childhood by saying that
04:34
my sister didn’t complete high school.
04:37
Things were too chaotic and her ability to cope was
04:43
just really tested.
04:45
I think I was a little more resilient but not without a lot of stress along
04:50
the way and I did finish high school.
04:54
I did okay.
04:55
But I managed to fall between the cracks of the college application pipeline.
05:02
I will say that
05:06
parents were not really present during my high school years, didn’t come to
05:10
parent-teachers’ nights or anything like that because there was always second jobs
05:13
needing to be worked and other factors.
05:17
I will say my older sister, my oldest sister, actually, did come.
05:22
The big conversation that really was missing was can I go to college?
05:31
It was never really a conversation in the family.
05:35
It wasn’t talked about as an option.
05:39
I think even though my father had gone to a teacher’s college and was an elementary
05:45
school teacher, his life was too consumed by the strain of finances to really
05:52
focus on what would make sense for me.
05:57
I remember a very critical day, I believe I was in the 11th grade,
06:02
when a counselor or somebody came into my English class and said if
06:08
you’re taking the SAT come with me.
06:10
If you’re not, stay in your class.
06:12
But I didn’t know what an SAT was.
06:14
I had never actually heard of it.
06:18
A lot of people in that class got up and walked out with that person
06:21
because they were taking the SAT.
06:22
I just stayed.
06:23
I sat in that seat.
06:25
I loved my English class, so that’s where I felt comfortable.
06:28
That’s what I knew,
06:31
but it further kept me out of that pipeline conversation
06:35
for how college might work.
06:37
The assumption, I think, for my parents was there just wasn’t the money for it.
06:41
They didn’t understand how financial aid worked.
06:44
That wasn’t really part of my plan as a child.
06:50
I should also add that my parents and me being the youngest of six, my
06:55
parents were actually quite advanced in age by the time I was born.
06:59
They were in their late 40s.
07:01
They came from a very different age when higher education worked differently.
07:09
Student loans and financial aid and SATs didn’t even exist
07:13
when they were growing up.
07:16
It wasn’t through neglect or fault of theirs that we missed that conversation,
07:20
it was just a set of circumstances.
07:22
Never really blamed them for it, even though I did feel a little bitter about
07:26
missing out on it for quite some time.
07:30
I would also like to add, and I hope I’m not taking too much time with this
07:33
conversation, but there were tremendous advantages amongst all that chaos and
07:39
instability about having older parents.
07:42
I think it enriched me greatly.
07:45
I think I was even conscious of it at the time that I grew up in a house that had
07:51
a deep sense of history, a deep sense of the story of the 20th century going way
08:00
back longer than most of my friends and peers had in their current family memory.
08:06
I think I really benefited from that.
08:09
My parents were born in the 1920s.
08:11
My grandfather served in World War I. When I would say that people insisted, I meant
08:16
World War II, but no, I meant World War I. I was surrounded by even if we lived in
08:25
a crappy house, we had books everywhere.
08:28
We had an upright player piano, so there was music and there was
08:33
literature at hand at all times.
08:36
I think that that profoundly impacted
08:41
my love of learning, even though I wasn’t in the college pipeline.
08:47
My first job, and something I did through most of high school, was
08:51
I worked part time in a bookstore.
08:54
That profoundly impacted me, too, having access to so many
08:58
resources and so much knowledge.
09:00
But growing up with it and then working part time as a high school student in
09:04
a bookstore kept me engaged with my mind in a way that I didn’t have in any
09:11
other outlet, like starting college.
09:14
That’s the short version of my story so far.
09:23
You went to college at some point, can we talk a little bit about maybe
09:28
the gap in between high school and college and then also start talking
09:35
about what college looked like and what that road looked like for you?
09:41
Absolutely.
09:44
As I mentioned, I started working in a bookstore part
09:46
time while I was in high school.
09:49
When I graduated from high school and not having a college plan, my
09:54
priority was to become independent from my family and to move out of the
09:59
house and get away from the stress of home life with my family at the time.
10:05
That led me on a series of fairly unpredictable adventures in my
10:10
early adult life, but one thing that was fairly consistent was that
10:16
I just kept working at bookstores.
10:19
I wound up working at a bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard for many years
10:26
and in addition to other part time jobs but full time at bookstore for
10:32
a number of years and living in a house with about five other folks
10:39
for a long number of years, folks who were I guess we called it loosely the
10:45
“punk rock flop house.” We were smart.
10:49
We were engaged in literature and music, but none of us had
10:55
our act together at the time.
10:58
We made the best of our circumstances, and it was a really amazing time in my life.
11:04
Certainly, didn’t have a lot of resources, but always scraped together that rent
11:09
and ate a lot of top ramen and ate a lot of pancake batter during those years.
11:19
Eventually, I think I’m going to actually tie, I’m going to get really honest here
11:24
and tie some of this into my identity.
11:28
During that time, I came out as queer, as gay.
11:34
It
11:37
was the early ‘90s and it was kind of
11:41
a rough time to be coming out as queer in Los Angeles, even in West Hollywood
11:48
which was a very queer neighborhood.
11:50
It was very oriented towards men and queer women were supposed to look very
11:57
feminine in the scene in Los Angeles.
12:00
I just didn’t fit into that whole universe.
12:06
To share very honestly, I actually was assaulted on several
12:11
occasions, “gay bashed” is what they called it at the time.
12:15
I think they still refer to it as that on several occasions in the Los Angeles
12:19
area, making my life a little rough.
12:25
I had a very dear friend who, still all these decades later, my best friend
12:31
on the planet, who had more resources than I did, and said quit your job, put
12:36
everything in storage, let’s go to Europe.
12:39
I’m covering the cost.
12:42
I did just that.
12:43
I spent three months traveling around everywhere from Morocco,
12:48
Portugal, and Spain to the Greek islands getting away from the chaos
12:55
of a pretty tough urban environment.
13:00
I came back and decided okay, I’m moving to San Francisco
13:07
[laughs] . I made my way up to San Francisco where I found a community
13:12
that made sense to me, and I made sense to them for the very first time.
13:16
I really found myself thriving in that urban environment
13:21
and in that particular scene.
13:23
I still worked at a bookstore.
13:25
I found a bookstore job up there.
13:27
Eventually I ended up shifting over to the coffeehouse scene and became a
13:32
barista and managed a coffee house on the corner of 18th and Castro, right in the
13:38
heart of the gay mecca of San Francisco.
13:41
For years I ran that shop and really, again, it was the first time in my adult
13:48
life that I became really connected to not just to a community but to myself in
13:56
a really authentic and comfortable way.
14:00
The six years I spent in San Francisco were absolutely
14:02
transformational in a lot of ways.
14:06
Eventually, I had one of the best jobs I ever had in my life.
14:10
I spent a couple of years as a FedEx driver in downtown San Francisco.
14:17
I just had so much fun with it.
14:20
This connects to college very much so, because two things eventually
14:25
happened while I lived in San Francisco.
14:28
Number one,
14:33
I decided to go to college.
14:34
I had a partner at the time whose mom said to me you’re smart.
14:39
You should go.
14:40
She was the first person in my life who had ever said that to me.
14:45
I respected her deeply and I thought her opinion matters to me, I should
14:49
seriously do something about college.
14:54
But there was a problem.
14:56
I didn’t know how.
14:58
I didn’t know how to access it, even a community college.
15:01
I didn’t know what registrar meant.
15:04
I didn’t know how to apply.
15:05
I didn’t know what matriculation meant.
15:08
I didn’t understand any of the terminology associated with
15:11
higher education at the time.
15:14
Ultimately, my closest friend, who’s still my closest friend to this
15:19
day, the one who took me to Europe, came up to San Francisco, went out
15:22
to the campus, and registered as me
15:27
[laughs] . I didn’t even go to campus.
15:29
She came back to my apartment and said, okay you’re
15:31
registered for summer class now.
15:33
You’re enrolled at the Community College of San Francisco.
15:37
I’m going to take the class with you, actually, I’m going to stick around
15:39
for a while, and take the class with you so you don’t have to go alone.
15:43
That’s a tremendous set of circumstances right there.
15:46
What an entryway for somebody who doesn’t even know how to walk through the front
15:49
door to having your closest person in your life say, I’m dragging you through the
15:56
door and I’m taking this journey with you.
15:59
The other thing that happened was that eventually working for FedEx
16:04
at the time at that job my bosses were very keen that I was in school.
16:14
When it came time for finals, as I was progressing through my
16:17
education, they would ask if I wanted to lighten my schedule.
16:21
If they knew I was on break they would ask if I wanted more hours.
16:25
They adapted to my scheduling needs as a student in a way that I think few
16:30
other employers would have at the time.
16:32
It made it possible for me to make it all work.
16:36
That’s how I started my college journey.
16:39
It’s how I found my authentic self in my first real community, and
16:44
it was absolutely transformational in how my life progressed from
16:49
that point forward.
16:56
Thank you for sharing all of that.
16:59
What did going to college mean to you?
17:02
I know we talked about it a little bit, but if you could elaborate on
17:07
what it meant for you in that moment but also now reflecting and thinking
17:11
about where you are now what it meant to you to take those first steps.
17:18
Well, let me describe a little bit now about those first steps in
17:21
addition to what I’ve already shared.
17:23
One of the first things I had to do was take a skills assessment test.
17:28
They had to know how well I wrote.
17:31
They had to know how much math I knew.
17:34
Those were the two things.
17:36
I remember sitting in an auditorium on campus and taking these
17:41
fill-in-the-bubble, Scantron exams and had a blue book with
17:47
a short writing sample prompted.
17:49
I can’t remember what it was about at this point.
17:54
I remember feeling, again, at this point I’ve worked for eight
18:00
to ten years in a bookstore.
18:01
I’m an avid reader.
18:03
I had been exercising my mind in a lot of different ways over the years.
18:10
When the results came back from my community college assessment, I was
18:15
put in non-transferrable remedial skill levels in both English and mathematics.
18:22
That was a shock to me.
18:24
For a lot of folks, it would have been: that’s it.
18:27
I’m not good at college.
18:28
I’m not going to do it.
18:30
But I was actually angry in a different way.
18:32
I was like, heck no.
18:36
I know I’m a smart person because I’ve been keeping myself smart all these years
18:40
even though I haven’t been in school.
18:44
If this is where I’m at, then I need additional training to fine tune those
18:48
skills in a way that works for education.
18:52
I took it as a challenge that I happily accepted, not as a defeat
18:56
that kept me away from my future.
18:59
That’s the way I chose to look at it.
19:02
I actually spent quite a few semesters at the community college
19:06
taking courses that, again, wouldn’t transfer to a four-year university.
19:13
Didn’t count towards anything other than me improving my skills and through
19:21
that very long period of time of working to get good at all of this stuff, I
19:29
found out that I was actually learning.
19:31
I could see the progression and then it transitions to now I just want to
19:36
take the hardest classes I can find.
19:39
I want to find out who are the teachers that everyone can’t stand, because those
19:43
are the teachers that are going to be the toughest on me and those are the
19:46
folks, I want to have them beat me down.
19:48
I want to have them push me.
19:50
I want to have them make me feel uncomfortable because that’s how I’m
19:53
going to become really good at education.
19:58
That’s how I approached it at the community college level.
20:04
Would you like me to continue that trajectory?
20:07
What happened next?
20:09
Yeah, but can I ask a quick question?
20:12
Please.
20:15
At this point when you’re at community college still, did you have a career goal
20:21
in mind or were you going to community college because college itself sort
20:27
of opened up doors and you were still trying to find where you wanted to go?
20:32
Sure.
20:33
I had no specific career plan in mind.
20:37
I didn’t even initially have a sense of where I wanted to transfer to.
20:43
I knew I wanted to transfer.
20:44
I knew I wanted a bachelor’s degree, but I didn’t—it’s not like I was doing this
20:50
because I wanted to go into business or nursing or a specific career path.
20:56
I did know that I wanted to absorb a wide breadth of knowledge and
21:02
not narrow my focus too much.
21:04
I wanted to know everything.
21:06
I wanted to be excellent at math.
21:09
I wanted to be a great writer.
21:11
I wanted to know history and to fully understand how it
21:15
explains who we are to this day.
21:19
I was all over the map.
21:20
I wanted to be fluent in French.
21:25
I took all of the general education courses, but I did it in a very
21:30
serious way of trying to get as much as I could out of a breadth
21:34
of knowledge available to me.
21:39
With that in mind, eventually it was recommended that I look at a
21:48
liberal arts college rather than transferring to a state school like
21:51
many of my classmates were doing, which would have been great, but
21:58
some folks made me aware that there were some schools in the east,
22:05
liberal arts colleges, that were very much supportive of non-traditional
22:11
female students in particular coming into college later in life.
22:15
If they could demonstrate excellence at the community college level
22:19
that there might be a chance to get into one of those kinds of schools.
22:27
I wasn’t overly optimistic.
22:30
My backup plan was San Francisco State University.
22:34
But enough people who, again who I respected and admired, suggested I
22:38
go for it, that I threw my hat in the ring and I applied to a lot of
22:42
what are known as the seven sister schools—Smith, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke,
22:48
Wellesley—just to see what would happen.
22:51
The thing about these colleges is they are all-women’s colleges, but
22:55
they also have a history, again, of recognizing that there are a lot of
23:01
things that keep women from pursuing an education in a traditional way.
23:08
They had some additional awareness of special circumstances.
23:15
Well, I needed to do interviews for those colleges.
23:19
I needed to get to the East Coast.
23:21
If you know anything about San Francisco, you’ll know that it’s pretty expensive
23:26
and being a part-time FedEx driver and a student meant that I didn’t have a
23:29
lot of extra money, or any money at all.
23:32
But I had one advantage.
23:35
I worked for what is actually known as and categorized as an airline.
23:40
FedEx does most of its work via airlines.
23:43
That meant I could fly for free on a cargo jet.
23:49
I did.
23:51
I flew to the East Coast on a FedEx plane with the cargo
23:59
[laughs] . It’s so funny to think about it now.
24:01
I did my college interviews at those schools.
24:05
I wanted to make sure that they understood that I didn’t have the
24:07
money to pay for their tuition.
24:09
Very expensive places to go.
24:11
I made sure they knew that I flew out there on a cargo jet.
24:14
They really loved that.
24:16
Anyway, long story short: I went from remedial part-time enrollment at the
24:23
Community College of San Francisco.
24:26
I won a full scholarship to Wellesley College to pursue my dream of really
24:33
that liberal arts, that broad education, a lifelong interest in history.
24:43
It was the right place for me to go and within a few months I
24:48
was on that campus taking Latin,
24:55
rowing crew, eating
24:59
in dining halls with 18 and 19-year-old young women who came from very
25:05
different backgrounds than myself and never did I feel like an outsider.
25:10
I felt immediately that that was where I belonged, that I had worked
25:14
really hard to get there, and that I deserved and had earned every
25:23
advantage of being in a place like that.
25:27
I was there for the next three years before I completed my bachelor’s
25:30
degree and I majored in ancient and near eastern archeology was my major.
25:38
A little esoteric, so
25:44
[laughs]
25:44
. You touched on it a little bit, but can we talk a little bit about
25:49
how being a non-traditional student shaped you and ultimately if it had
25:56
any influence what influence it had on your master’s and Ph.D. program?
26:02
Yes, absolutely.
26:04
I just mentioned that
26:08
I felt like I had earned–I mean, I was completely overwhelmed to be offered
26:12
that opportunity to go to Wellesley and have that kind of support and have
26:16
the opportunity to study in that way.
26:23
While I knew that I had worked very hard for that I also recognized that
26:27
my circumstances were pretty unusual.
26:31
I
26:34
think I also mentioned that when I had taken that initial test at the community
26:38
college and had scored so low in writing and mathematics, I took it as a challenge.
26:44
Then when I found myself at Wellesley
26:49
rather than being overwhelmed by the intense academic environment, I mean it
26:53
was really several notches up in intensity from anything I had experienced before.
26:58
The workload was through the roof.
27:01
The expectations were much higher.
27:05
Again, I took it as a challenge.
27:07
This is my chance to push myself and to see my potential really come to fruition.
27:15
I dove all in.
27:18
I pulled all-nighters.
27:20
I learned the value of napping.
27:22
As an adult, I had never been a napper but my gosh, I had to take my nap in
27:28
the middle of the day for at least an hour just to keep up with the pace
27:32
of what was being expected of me.
27:37
As a non-traditional aged student, I think it’s really common and some of my
27:44
non-traditional peers at Wellesley felt this way, that they were somehow different
27:49
or separate from the main student body.
27:51
I never felt that way because I refused consciously to let that define me.
28:01
I knew that I was just as smart as the traditional aged students there and just
28:06
had a different set of circumstances.
28:08
I went all in.
28:11
I will say there were a couple aspects of my being older, and I
28:16
was in my early 30s at this point,
28:20
that made my experience there a little unusual.
28:23
Number one, I was asked by the college to manage the campus bar because I
28:30
was older and so they thought that I would be more responsible and that
28:36
I would enforce the ID requirement.
28:42
I became somewhat unpopular with a certain section of the student population because
28:47
I actually did enforce the ID requirement.
28:52
However, when I graduated the campus police presented me with the Sergeant
28:57
stripes and police patch because I was so reliable when it came to drinking
29:04
and making sure everyone was kept safe.
29:07
Anyway, that wouldn’t have happened had I been 18 years old when I got there.
29:12
It enhanced my experience a bit.
29:15
Additionally, I found myself being relied on by some of the traditional aged
29:20
students regarding the mysteries of life.
29:25
I’ll never forget the student who turned to me in the middle of a
29:29
classical mythology class and said, so when you graduate and you’re renting
29:34
an apartment how do you pay rent?
29:38
What is the mechanism by which rent is paid?
29:41
At the time it involved writing a check.
29:43
We don’t even do that anymore, most of us, but simply you write a
29:49
check.
29:52
She said, what’s a check?
29:53
[Laughs]
29:53
. There were a handful of traditional students that I became very close with
29:57
that I’m still very much in contact with who saw me as someone who was
30:02
wise because I had lived life already.
30:07
Personally, the ability to
30:13
have such a rich educational environment, to be sent overseas
30:19
for two summers to do archeological excavations on the island of Cyprus.
30:26
I did my sciences at MIT as part of the college consortium.
30:32
I did my thesis research at the Semitic library at Harvard, and this is just
30:39
after being a FedEx driver and community college student in San Francisco.
30:45
Again, a radical transformation of opportunity.
30:49
I was conscious of it at the time.
30:51
I didn’t take it lightly.
30:55
I felt an obligation to recognize what had been afforded me, even though
30:59
I worked my butt off to earn it.
31:02
Rather than graduating and, I don’t know, maybe pursuing a master’s
31:10
degree in archeology or something.
31:13
I said, I’ve done my archeological fantasy.
31:16
This has been incredible.
31:17
Education is so powerful, if you’re able to find a way to
31:22
access it and fully dive in.
31:25
I want to spend the rest of my professional life supporting students
31:31
on their journey to success in persisting, helping others to persist
31:38
and to complete and to find ways to enhance their educational experience.
31:44
After I graduated from Wellesley I moved to New York, started working at New
31:48
York University and pursued my graduate career there in higher education and
31:55
that is how ultimately, I became a higher education professional, very
32:01
focused on student access to education and making sure that students are seen
32:09
to the best of my ability and that their experience is understood and
32:14
supported in any way I possibly can.
32:23
Just a quick follow-up, do you think your identity as a queer
32:30
individual contributed to that at all?
32:39
I think in some ways I think it’s secondary, actually.
32:48
I think my identity in relation to being a non-traditional student—my unusual
32:57
path to education—is actually the primary motivator for why I do the work I do.
33:07
I think my identity as a queer person plays a secondary role in that in this
33:16
highly visible position, visible to students [and my peers, of course, but
33:22
really with students] and so I hope that my presentation as a queer person is also
33:31
seen as a positive thing by queer students who are looking for perhaps a mentor or
33:41
somebody that they can comfortably go and talk to about anything or just to
33:47
be seen as a professional with a very overt queer identity—my presentation
33:54
is pretty overt—gives reassurance to queer students that a future with an
34:02
authentic identity is very possible.
34:05
I think that that, I think that my visibility and that part of who I
34:12
am could only have become a thing because of the fact that I decided
34:21
that being in higher education was going to be my life profession.
34:27
That came first and then being, presenting queer is also an added bonus, I hope,
34:36
in terms of visibility with students.
34:42
Can you talk a little bit about your jobs before you came to OSU?
34:47
Yeah.
34:50
Well, I started at New York University prior to me going there for grad school.
34:56
I worked as an operations manager in their housing division.
35:05
Because of my previous work as a manager in a bookstore, as a manager
35:13
of a coffeehouse, as a FedEx driver with all of the logistics that go
35:17
on, my operational background was still the primary piece of my resume.
35:22
It landed me an operations job.
35:26
That job was at a great university.
35:30
There were additional opportunities that I could take advantage of.
35:36
It was a good job.
35:37
I was part of a housing system that had 12,000 beds in the middle of Manhattan.
35:42
That’s a lot of students living in an intensely urban environment.
35:48
It was great.
35:51
About a year later, I applied for and was accepted to the Masters of Higher
35:57
Education Administration Program, and I did that part-time, completed
36:01
that in about two and a half years.
36:03
That really started the professional education that
36:07
would lead to my future career.
36:12
I loved the program and had a lot of really great experiences along the way.
36:19
As soon as I knew I was completing it I knew I didn’t want to stop.
36:23
There was the potential to continue with a doctorate and
36:32
the doctorate, the Ph.D. program in higher post-secondary education
36:37
at New York University only admitted full-time students.
36:44
Part-time students were put on a path for what’s known as an EPD, a Doctor
36:49
of Education, which is different from a Ph.D., which is more research based.
36:54
Long story short, I didn’t want an EPD.
36:56
I wanted a Ph.D., but I couldn’t go full-time.
36:59
They actually made an exception for me and allowed me to do my Ph.D. part-time.
37:04
Again,
37:07
what an amazing opportunity to be the exception, to make the best of that
37:15
exceptional set of circumstances.
37:20
Again, I went all-in.
37:21
I worked full-time.
37:22
At this point I was the director of
37:28
a residential building for campus.
37:30
I was in the Division of Student Affairs, and I ran a building with 700
37:34
first-year students on Fifth Avenue.
37:37
That came with an apartment, which was pretty sweet.
37:39
I’m not going to lie; it was nice to live in a high-rise apartment on Fifth Avenue.
37:43
For five years I did that role while I was working on my Ph.D. I finished my
37:48
part-time Ph.D. in five and a half years.
37:51
That was pretty good for a part-timer.
37:54
What did I do my research on?
37:58
You might want to know because I think it relates to what I’ve been sharing with
38:05
you.
38:05
If you ever have an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. in the humanities,
38:12
you will often find yourself entering with an idea of what you want to
38:17
study but you will often be counseled into really studying what you know.
38:24
It very often has to do with your own lived experience and so ultimately what
38:29
I did was a study of non-traditional women identifying the time in their life
38:36
where other considerations were no longer priorities for a lot of different reasons.
38:42
Maybe the children had grown.
38:44
Maybe the divorce had been complete.
38:48
Maybe the moment of inspiration had occurred due to a set of circumstances.
38:55
Whatever it was, the time became clear that it was their time to
39:00
pursue their dream in education.
39:03
I studied women like myself who had found their journey and what
39:09
that moment of realization of opportunity, what it involved.
39:14
What were the circumstances that caused it and how these women found their
39:18
way to completing a bachelor’s degree?
39:23
They were anywhere from in their 20s to well into their 70s quite frankly,
39:29
were the women who I was working with who found their way to education
39:32
for the first time in their lives.
39:34
That was a really rewarding experience.
39:37
I got to work with some phenomenal leaders in education during that
39:43
journey and I completed my Ph.D. in higher and post-secondary education
39:49
in 2014 and then moved to Oregon.
39:54
I do miss the East Coast, I will say.
39:56
I miss that snow in the winter.
39:57
I wish we were getting it right now, but just another Oregon rainy winter.
40:04
I came here and I took a leadership position at Lane Community College.
40:10
Eventually I became the Dean of Student Affairs at Lane Community College.
40:17
In that role,
40:20
I had quite what they call a large portfolio that I oversaw.
40:26
I oversaw the entire Academic Advising Department for the institution.
40:30
I oversaw the
40:34
multicultural center and multicultural programs, including Native American
40:40
program in the Longhouse on campus.
40:44
I oversaw what had been the women’s center which I actually, quite a story
40:52
here, but engineered the change in the mission and name of that office
41:00
from the Women’s Center to the Gender Equity Center and redesigned its
41:06
mission to be inclusive of identities and also with a very clear purpose that
41:14
addressing men’s issues creates a better world for everyone.
41:19
I can go into that a little bit more if you want.
41:21
That was not without some controversy, I will say, but it is
41:26
still holding strong to this today.
41:28
Pleased for that.
41:30
Also, was in charge of their commencement and moved their commencement back to
41:37
campus for the first time in 30 years and redesigned how all of that went.
41:42
There were some tremendous opportunities to make positive
41:44
change at Lane Community College.
41:47
In 2018 I moved to OSU.
41:51
I’m very pleased to be able to say that, because even prior to coming here
41:55
it was very well-known that the work culture at OSU, just the environment
42:01
is just a very wonderful place.
42:04
All places have their blemishes and bruises, but OSU has been phenomenal and
42:10
working at the College of Agricultural Science has just been incredibly rewarding
42:13
and I’m just very happy to be here now and continuing the work that I do with a
42:17
whole new type of student, quite frankly.
42:21
This is the first large public institution, the first public institution
42:26
for four-year institution that I’ve ever worked at, very different from working
42:32
with community college students and very different from working with NYU
42:38
students.
42:38
That’s a large private university so there are a lot of different considerations
42:43
there, but incredibly rewarding.
42:46
Quite frankly, not just saying this because of this interview, but I
42:50
think OSU really is the leader in this state for a lot of good reasons.
42:59
Can you talk a little bit about what your job looks like and maybe the day-to-day,
43:07
both before COVID and now that we’re going through this crazy COVID pandemic?
43:15
Absolutely.
43:17
As I said in the beginning, I’m the Student Engagement Coordinator for the
43:20
College of Agricultural Sciences, and this position is relatively recent.
43:26
It, I believe, was started I think in 2014 or 2015, so a few years before I arrived.
43:33
It was still in development when I started.
43:38
The Dean of Academic Programs Office, which is where this position is located.
43:44
I’m still trying to fine-tune and define the role of Student
43:47
Engagement Coordinator.
43:53
The basic outline of the role is: to provide leadership and vision and
44:00
support for student organizations [there’s a lot more detail that goes
44:06
into that, but I don’t want to go down any specific rabbit hole unless asked];
44:12
and to administer and run and support three of the College’s undergraduate
44:19
research support programs; to work very closely with our branch
44:24
experiment stations around the state in terms of opportunities to connect
44:28
with undergraduate researchers; to teach a class that’s offered every
44:33
spring, called, “Critical Issues in Oregon Agriculture;” to support
44:42
the student learning experience outside of the classroom in every way that
44:47
that might occur [sometimes that takes the form of an event or a program or
44:54
a training opportunity and sometimes it takes the form of a one-on-one
45:00
conversation in my office with a student].
45:05
My role is to really be present to not just be there for students to walk in
45:11
but to go out and, again as I mentioned before, to make sure students are
45:16
seen, acknowledged to the best of my ability and have an understanding of
45:24
the many different opportunities that they can choose to take advantage of.
45:30
Really, to try to be mindful of how some students might
45:36
be hesitant or unsure and to be the hand that reaches out
45:41
and says, no, no it’s okay.
45:43
Come.
45:43
Let’s do this.
45:46
Some students really need that and thrive from that.
45:51
My job is to just be there for students and to find ways to help support and
45:57
see them at commencement, ultimately.
46:02
Does that answer your question?
46:05
Yes.
46:06
Did I get there?
46:06
Okay!
46:11
Maybe if you can.
46:14
Oh, COVID!
46:14
Yeah, COVID.
46:17
Yes.
46:18
I knew there was something.
46:18
Okay.
46:21
How does everything I just described work in a year where everything is remote?
46:27
Well, actually I have a lot of positive things to say about some
46:31
pretty negative set of circumstances.
46:36
Last summer, summer of 2020, I guess it was, the question was really out
46:42
there: how do we do engagement if we can’t even physically be in the same
46:49
general area, much less the same room?
46:53
We had all been familiar with Zoom and have used it here and there, but
46:59
it didn’t take long to realize that engagement might actually, in some
47:05
ways, not in every way, but in some ways
47:10
be more broad and reach more students and be more accessible
47:16
to students via remote connection.
47:22
I’ll give you a quick example.
47:24
At the beginning every fall term one of my jobs is to hold an engagement
47:29
event during welcome week where all the student organizations gather on the
47:34
quad in front of Strand Agricultural Hall and set up their tables to recruit
47:39
new students and share what they’re about and helping our new and returning
47:44
students to those club communities.
47:47
That’s always a lovely event, but obviously we couldn’t do it in person.
47:51
So, what were we going to do?
47:53
I created a virtual event, not via Zoom, actually, but using Canvas,
47:58
which was challenging but I think the right way to do it at the time.
48:05
Long story short, we were able to actually get over 600 students to attend virtually,
48:13
whereas when we had it on the quad maybe a couple of hundred students would show up.
48:19
I think there is some good reasons to speculate causes for that.
48:25
I think one of the things is that we’re able to engage in our very
48:28
valued E-campus students more broadly because or remote technology.
48:34
When things are set up for remote delivery to a Corvallis student, that
48:40
means E-campus can also be there.
48:42
It’s harder to get E-campus students to engage in an event that’s physically
48:46
on campus that’s not being streamed.
48:49
That was a thing, and we had a lot more E-campus students contacting about
48:54
joining clubs and engaging and connecting with community than ever before.
48:59
The other thing, quite frankly, is a lot of students can, if they’re sitting
49:05
in their dorm or their apartment, regardless of where they are, they
49:09
can click that button and show up.
49:12
Whereas if they were on campus, they may have multiple distractions as
49:16
they walk across the quad to get to an event that might derail or catch
49:21
their attention in a different way.
49:25
We’ve seen an actual increase in engagement in events like that
49:30
welcome week event, in undergraduate research mixers with faculty.
49:34
We had over 100 students attend last month, whereas the last in-person
49:40
version of that event I think we had about 30 students when it was on campus.
49:45
It’s been exciting.
49:46
I think one of the things I’m talking to the college leadership
49:50
about is that we can’t go back and do it the old way moving forward.
49:58
After the pandemic, we actually need to take the best of our growth in
50:03
engagement and preserve that, even when we’re back having in-person events.
50:09
We need to find new visions and new ways of maintaining that accessibility
50:15
and that outreach to students, whether they are sitting in a dorm on
50:19
campus or whether they are in rural Pennsylvania streaming in from a farm.
50:26
They are OSU students all and they deserve to have access to as many
50:30
opportunities as anyone who’s currently physically in the Corvallis area.
50:35
That’s something we’re really trying to plan for.
50:39
Of course, there have been some drawbacks, too, right?
50:43
We all get Zoom fatigue.
50:45
I know at the end of my workday; I just want to stare out the window.
50:52
I don’t want to look at a screen anymore.
50:55
I’m almost like in a catatonic state, just zoning out staring at the
50:59
birdfeeder in the backyard or something.
51:03
I think this kind of engagement can be both exciting, in terms of
51:10
its reach, but I do think that it can be taxing and exhausting to
51:17
constantly be interacting in this way.
51:20
We need to find that fine balance of how we’ll be doing engagement in the future.
51:28
It’s not all been bad, let’s put it that way.
51:30
It’s not all been bad.
51:34
That’s my general description of, I think how things have
51:37
been going pre and during COVID.
51:40
Hopefully we’ll be at post COVID soon and I can provide you with an update.
51:46
Can you talk a little bit about the impact you’ve had on the experiential
51:53
opportunities in the College of Agricultural Sciences, because
51:56
I know that you’ve changed them or, in my opinion, improved them.
52:01
Can you talk a little bit about that?
52:04
Sure.
52:06
There’s several things going on there.
52:10
Are you referring to undergraduate research in particular or just overall?
52:17
Overall, also.
52:18
Sure.
52:19
Well, let me maybe talk about them in a couple different categories.
52:23
When it comes to the undergraduate research programs, I’ve been working
52:26
very hard for the last few years to
52:30
better connect students
52:35
with how to access undergraduate research opportunities, whether it’s through the
52:39
programs I oversee or other university supported programs or through how to break
52:47
down the barriers of communication between an undergraduate student and a potential
52:51
research mentor, a faculty mentor.
52:56
I’ve actually been able to go to every START session, so every incoming
53:02
first-year student or transfer student into our college now gets a short
53:07
presentation from me and gets told please reach out to me and contact me and
53:12
let’s have a one-on-one and a lot of the students have started to take advantage
53:16
of that and really explore how to access these kinds of opportunities, whereas I
53:21
think before it was maybe just a handful of students that stumbled upon these
53:27
kind of opportunities and would apply.
53:29
Now we’re seeing a huge increase in not just students and applications for these
53:35
programs but fortunately I’ve been able to do a lot of presentations to faculty
53:42
encouraging them to submit proposals and to create learning opportunities for
53:47
research with undergraduates specifically.
53:51
I actually have spent an increasing amount of time with faculty and
53:56
guiding them through how they can participate in all of these programs.
53:59
I work with both the faculty—a lot of presentations, a lot of
54:03
interactions, a lot of one-on-one conversations—and with students.
54:09
Actually, soon I’ll be having a conversation with parents of currently
54:13
enrolled students who have signed up to learn more about the importance
54:17
of research for their student potentially, not so that they expect
54:22
it but so that they understand it if their students are doing it and what
54:28
the potential benefits of that are.
54:30
I’ve been trying to develop these programs and grow them,
54:35
hopefully with good results.
54:38
Other experiential opportunities, I’m going to jump to clubs really
54:41
quick and just say a few words.
54:47
I feel like I’ve spent a lot of time strengthening my role in terms of
54:52
coherent support and increasing the visibility and awareness of students
54:59
of all of the student organizations that we have in our college.
55:04
We have over 30 active student clubs and organizations and many of them have
55:09
existed for a long time, some are new.
55:14
As I always say, these aren’t just clubs that are having a bake
55:17
sale and hanging out for fun-zees.
55:19
Our clubs, our student organizations are an extension of the learning experience.
55:24
They are learning communities.
55:26
They are oftentimes affiliated with academic departments,
55:30
with specific faculty mentors.
55:32
They
55:34
are so engaged in professional development and, again, finding that community of
55:41
peers, both in an organization where there’s a common interest and something
55:46
I always tell incoming students, again I get to go to all their START sessions
55:50
so they hear from me, is the ability to connect with a student organization
55:55
that maybe is focused on something you know nothing about and engaging with
55:59
something totally new for the first time.
56:03
We’ve seen a lot of growth in our momentum with student organizations
56:09
and they’ve actually been able to stay pretty impressively strong
56:14
and active during this COVID year, which I’m just very impressed by.
56:21
Again, they are an extension of our learning mission and they, to me,
56:29
are very connected to that hands-on learning experience because so
56:33
much of what they do is hands-on, whether being out at the sheep barn
56:38
and doing ultrasounds or lambing season or food and fermentation and
56:47
their actual projects and playing with chemistry and fermentation
56:53
and all kinds of things.
56:55
You get to take what you learn in class, and you actually get to play
56:58
with it with our student organization.
57:03
I do see that as part of the bigger picture.
57:08
I also work with a lot of folks in specific departments that coordinate
57:13
internships and that is a huge part of the experiential learning piece.
57:19
I don’t oversee internships for the college.
57:21
They’re really departmentally run but I try to provide guidance
57:27
and support and connect potential internship opportunities.
57:33
We want to make sure they are vetted and set up for a positive student experience.
57:41
There’s a lot that goes into that that I help coordinate.
57:50
I feel like there are so many other examples that I could
57:52
go on and on and on about,
57:56
but I do think that the experiential connection for students is oftentimes
58:03
what helps students recognize the learning that they’re experiencing.
58:07
It’s one thing to get a great mark on an exam or to write a phenomenal paper.
58:11
That’s a great reflection of your learning.
58:14
But when you’re able to engage your learning in an in-person, hands-on way
58:21
you really get to apply it and see wow,
58:26
that’s, now look at me.
58:27
I’m doing an ultrasound on a sheep.
58:30
I use that example, again, but it’s a good example.
58:35
I think it’s so important to help students recognize their learning.
58:40
It helps them stay engaged in the process.
58:42
Again, for me it’s all about
58:50
that [audio breaks up] and if appropriate, to give them a hug on their way to
58:54
the stage and say congratulations.
58:57
Anything I can do to support that.
58:59
That’s just my mission, my professional mission.
59:10
Can we go back a little bit and talk about your first day, the day you interviewed,
59:18
for your position with the College of Ag?
59:20
You bet.
59:21
Absolutely.
59:25
I was offered an interview for this position back in early summer of
59:33
2018.
59:34
Let’s talk about assumptions and stereotypes for a moment, right?
59:38
Again, I’ve mentioned during this talk that I’m pretty
59:41
overtly a queer individual.
59:45
My presentation is pretty gender queer.
59:54
I was offered an interview on campus at the College of Agricultural Sciences.
1:00:00
I’ll talk about my assumptions and my stereotypes first.
1:00:05
I thought to myself, agriculture is
1:00:11
kind of understood to be a fairly conservative field.
1:00:16
Again, these were my assumptions at the time.
1:00:19
I wonder how I’ll be received on campus.
1:00:22
They don’t know what to expect.
1:00:24
They’d probably not seen a picture of me.
1:00:26
I don’t have a huge online presence.
1:00:28
So, of course, I signed up for the interview and it was a half a day
1:00:34
on campus meeting with students, with faculty, doing a public
1:00:39
presentation, a lunch, all kinds of very long process for the day.
1:00:49
I knew without any question that I was going to show up as my authentic
1:00:53
self, because for me the response that I would get on campus from those I
1:00:57
was meeting with in the college was going to tell me a lot about the place,
1:01:01
and, again, I was fairly certain, or at least I thought there was a
1:01:06
strong possibility that I might get some looks or maybe a strange comment
1:01:10
about my appearance and my identity.
1:01:15
I have to tell you, the second I walked in I felt so comfortable.
1:01:20
I walked into the Academic Programs Office, and I was
1:01:23
greeted without hesitation.
1:01:25
Nobody stumbled or hesitated.
1:01:27
All of the things that I was being mindful to be aware of didn’t
1:01:32
happen throughout the entire day.
1:01:35
In fact, the only sign of
1:01:40
any, the only thing that anyone said that might have been connected to my
1:01:45
identity was that one person asked if I preferred to be called Christina or Chris.
1:01:52
I found that to be a very respectful question and coming from somebody
1:01:58
who was really intending to be respectful and thoughtful.
1:02:05
I may have defied some of their assumptions.
1:02:07
They never let on.
1:02:08
But I will tell you one thing the College of Agricultural Sciences and
1:02:11
everyone I met that day completely defied my assumptions and expectations.
1:02:18
I left after that interview completely changed in my mind
1:02:24
about what I had expected.
1:02:26
I really felt great about OSU in general.
1:02:31
I had had a favorable impression of the university prior to interviewing and then
1:02:37
after that day with the college staff and students I just knew that if I was
1:02:43
going to be hired here, I would feel
1:02:48
pretty welcome and very comfortable, and it might be a place that I
1:02:52
could do a lot of great work.
1:02:56
Everybody has assumptions.
1:02:58
Assumptions aren’t, they
1:03:02
aren’t sort of the bad thing of just one side of an issue.
1:03:08
Everybody possesses them and it’s just so awesome when they get
1:03:12
completely challenged and proved wrong [laughs] . Fortunately, the College
1:03:19
of Agricultural Sciences proved me wrong, and it’s been great ever since.
1:03:27
I’m glad you got hired.
1:03:30
You’re my favorite person at OSU.
1:03:31
Thank you.
1:03:35
Now that you’re here at OSU, can we talk about your involvement in
1:03:42
actively working towards making those progressive changes on campus?
1:03:49
Yes.
1:03:53
As with many new jobs oftentimes that first year, especially when you’re hired
1:04:00
into a position in a complex organization, it’s always a good idea to ride things
1:04:07
out, see how everything connects.
1:04:09
There are a lot of components to my position.
1:04:11
I spent the first year going through and learning all of the different
1:04:17
components of my position and how they functioned historically and how they
1:04:22
intersected with so many different parts of the college and the university.
1:04:28
In many ways I’m working with faculty.
1:04:30
In many ways I’m working with students and students who are about to graduate.
1:04:35
Students who are brand new and need a lot of support—just a lot of different
1:04:42
intersectionalities in my role.
1:04:46
I spent the first-year learning that and also observing how I might do
1:04:51
things differently, seeing where some challenges and barriers existed
1:04:59
and trying to recognize as many of them as possible.
1:05:01
Nobody’s perfect, but I certainly was trying to see okay this is
1:05:06
how things are, how would I do it?
1:05:08
What works well and what do I want to continue with and what do I want
1:05:13
to change to improve the student experience on multiple levels?
1:05:20
Access to certain opportunities—huge.
1:05:22
Also creating an environment where people feel really welcome,
1:05:25
supported and very importantly seen, which is a recurring theme for me.
1:05:34
Year two, I created a plan for changing certain aspects of my role
1:05:45
and how things were functioning.
1:05:48
They included changing a historical student leadership institution
1:05:54
at the college, and that was the Agricultural Executive Council.
1:05:58
Ag Exec had been just a phenomenal leadership group of students
1:06:03
for decades within the college and my role was their advisor.
1:06:08
Yet during my first year I worked with a great group of students on that
1:06:11
council but also recognized that the council and how it functioned with
1:06:19
our student organizations and a lot of the annual events at the college
1:06:25
needed some work on creating a
1:06:29
more inclusive environment for students
1:06:35
and that in some ways it needed to be updated to better serve our
1:06:41
student organizations and by turn better serve our student population.
1:06:47
Yet, this was a historical institution that many of our alumni had been members
1:06:51
of and it was no small thing to turn it on its head and radically transform it.
1:06:57
That was something I identified was a need and then,
1:07:02
well, let’s just stick with that to begin with.
1:07:05
I did.
1:07:06
I worked with the college leadership and created a new student leadership
1:07:11
group that was not elected.
1:07:13
It was an application-interview process.
1:07:17
Our first group, called the Club Leadership Team, is comprised of students
1:07:21
from a variety of different majors and departments, broadest most diverse group
1:07:26
of student leaders working with clubs that we’d seen in a long time with a different
1:07:33
mission to more effectively serve and support our student organizations
1:07:38
and really connect them to college leadership and elevate their role in
1:07:44
building community within the college.
1:07:47
Year two was about identifying challenges like that, and year three, which we’re
1:07:53
coming close to the conclusion of right now, this was the year of implementation.
1:07:58
This was the year of okay, we’re actually doing this.
1:08:04
Of course, what a year to start radically transforming things
1:08:07
and doing things differently.
1:08:09
You got a whole new plan for student leadership and you go a worldwide
1:08:14
pandemic and everything is remote and off-campus, but you know it’s been going
1:08:19
pretty well I would say and I mentioned earlier our student organizations have
1:08:25
really maintained phenomenal momentum in keeping communities strong and I
1:08:31
think that has a lot to do with how we transformed the leadership structure
1:08:36
that works with me throughout the year, creating a really overtly inclusive
1:08:45
environment and making sure there’s a place for all students within our college
1:08:53
and that people can be visible and fully participate in our student communities
1:09:00
and so that’s what’s happened this year.
1:09:02
It’s been great!
1:09:03
An example of that, I will give you, is we have a new student organization
1:09:08
called, “Students for Cultivating Change.” There had been some connection with the
1:09:14
college and the national organization of cultivating change for a couple of
1:09:18
years. Our Dean of our College, when he was new, actually I met him and had
1:09:25
my first conversation with him at the event at the National Organization called
1:09:29
“Cultivating Change” held in Portland.
1:09:32
He was very supportive.
1:09:34
This organization is about supporting LGBTQ community in agriculture.
1:09:41
Again, defying those assumptions that I had on my interview day, right?
1:09:48
Our College Dean, brand new from Texas, was at that event up in Portland fully
1:09:52
supportive of the efforts to support the LGBTQ community within agriculture.
1:09:59
This was the year that I put a call out to students if you’re interested, contact me.
1:10:04
Let’s start this student group called, “Students for Cultivating Change.”
1:10:09
We did that in early September.
1:10:12
My co-advisor, Robin Frojen, who’s been at the College for a number of years and
1:10:16
runs the creamery, makes all the great OSU cheese, she and I are co-advisors for
1:10:21
this student group and we started working with interested students in fall term,
1:10:27
went through the university recognition process, wrote a constitution, really had
1:10:31
the students lead that effort, and just at the beginning of this winter term of
1:10:37
2021 received our official university recognition and had our first election,
1:10:43
our student leaders are elected to serve the rest of the academic year.
1:10:48
We’re now an official part of the college student community.
1:10:52
I think the visibility and the support of the college will increase our membership
1:11:00
and one of the big recurring themes from our current members, two recurring themes
1:11:07
actually, number one is for students who are juniors or seniors or close to
1:11:12
graduation many of them have said I always hoped to find something like this and I’m
1:11:19
so glad it happened before I graduated.
1:11:22
What’s really stunning is some of the first-year students in
1:11:29
the club at this point saying, I hoped something like this existed.
1:11:33
I didn’t see it when I applied but I hoped it would be here
1:11:37
by the time I got to campus.
1:11:39
What that says to me is that there’s a need to have a community.
1:11:43
The fact that this community got established using Zoom and during the
1:11:51
year of the pandemic further says that there were students who were wanting
1:11:57
very much to connect with each other to find an authentic queer community
1:12:05
respectful of identities and just to have somebody to hang with, even virtually.
1:12:12
I think that when we come back to campus, I know that we will be visible.
1:12:20
We will have our logo out there and I’m just very excited for students who will
1:12:24
be coming to OSU, and specifically to our college in the future, to come to that
1:12:29
club event and to see that table with that rainbow flag with our college logo on it,
1:12:34
saying yes there’s a place for you here.
1:12:37
You are welcome.
1:12:38
You’re supported and you’re seen.
1:12:41
I think it’s going to be tremendous, not just for recruiting but for
1:12:45
helping students stay the course and complete their degree with us.
1:12:50
It’s a wonderful thing.
1:12:51
It’s been a lot of fun.
1:12:52
I’m excited to see where it goes.
1:12:54
Can you expand a little bit on the support that Students for
1:13:00
Cultivating Change has gotten from the College of Agricultural Sciences?
1:13:05
Yeah, absolutely.
1:13:07
I was very encouraged, as I said before, Dean Alan Sams and I had our
1:13:11
first interaction at an event for the national organization back in,
1:13:17
gosh I think it was winter of 2019.
1:13:23
He was brand new, and I had been at the college for maybe
1:13:25
six months at that point.
1:13:29
Knowing that he had been there as a supporter gave me confidence that
1:13:36
forming a chapter of that national organization within our College
1:13:39
would be well-supported by him.
1:13:41
In the meantime, I had been asked by the Executive Dean of the College, Dr.
1:13:48
Staci Simonich, to serve on a new climate diversity and inclusivity task force
1:13:58
that the College launched this past year.
1:14:01
In some of the early meetings of this task force, which is comprised, by the
1:14:05
way, of faculty, staff, grad students, undergraduate students, really taking
1:14:09
a hard look at where the College is in current efforts to create an inclusive
1:14:15
and supportive environment for all, particularly in regard to ethnicity and
1:14:20
background and queer and gender identity.
1:14:25
It
1:14:28
became clear to me that the College was not just paying lip service or
1:14:32
going through the motions in trying to check off boxes but was actually doing
1:14:36
some really hard work to assess the current situation and just see where
1:14:42
change was needed and what that change could look like to be truly effective.
1:14:46
With all of that, I just felt very confident that establishing a chapter
1:14:52
of Students for Cultivating Change was going to be very well-supported.
1:14:57
I was actually, even though I had that confidence, I was actually very surprised,
1:15:03
kind of blown away by the level of support the College has expressed since
1:15:11
learning of the efforts to establish and make official this student group.
1:15:19
To be specific, I was approached by Dr. Staci Simonich and asked to
1:15:27
present on the formation of this group to that task force to talk about
1:15:35
how this group was forming, how these students viewed being a part of a club
1:15:41
like this, having a club like this at the college, and really just to share
1:15:46
this positive development with the entire task force as a way to advance a positive
1:15:54
climate for students, a welcoming and supportive environment for students.
1:15:58
Additionally, the head of the communications team for the College,
1:16:04
somebody who reports directly to Dean Alan Sams, is on that task force and
1:16:09
after my presentation contacted me and wanted to meet with myself and my
1:16:15
co-advisor Robin Frojen to talk more about the group and what was happening
1:16:20
with its formation and where it was in the official university approval process
1:16:25
and what it would mean for students.
1:16:28
We talked with her a bit and,
1:16:33
again, she reports directly to Dean Sams, she came back with a proposal
1:16:38
of support that really surprised us.
1:16:43
They out of their budget, I don’t think this happens for very many
1:16:46
student organizations, designed
1:16:52
a logo, which is the official university beaver logo, with
1:16:55
the inclusive rainbow font.
1:16:59
I could actually share it with you separately.
1:17:01
It’s pretty cool, and I think a lot of you seeing this interview will
1:17:05
maybe see it around campus afterwards.
1:17:09
For COVID masks, to have that with the college’s official logo next to it.
1:17:15
This is really tremendous.
1:17:16
If you think about a very queer symbol of the LGBTQ+ and allied community combined
1:17:25
with, done in the actual lettering that is official university beaver script.
1:17:34
That has to go through the university for approval, and
1:17:36
that had never happened before.
1:17:38
That’s done in rainbow and then paired with the official College
1:17:42
of Agricultural Sciences logo.
1:17:45
You can’t get more thumbs up and approval and support from
1:17:50
an institution than to have that combination of things in one place.
1:17:54
That was done for this group and it’s going to be produced in the form of
1:18:00
COVID masks, t-shirts for club members.
1:18:03
Everyone’s getting one t-shirt, one polo, although I’ll say this, queer folks
1:18:10
tend not to be big polo wearers, but we’re going to get those polos anyway,
1:18:17
and very importantly a very high-end, beautifully produced, large 8’ long
1:18:27
tablecloth banner made for tabling for this student organization to
1:18:33
be highly visible at student events and to say to the entire college
1:18:37
community: we are here, please come be a part of us if you identify as
1:18:43
part of this community and/or an ally.
1:18:47
We are here and to have the college logo on that tablecloth.
1:18:53
It’s just, it’s incredibly supportive.
1:18:56
There’s no hesitation.
1:18:57
There was no conversation like should we, shouldn’t we?
1:18:59
It was without hesitation let’s put some money behind this.
1:19:04
Let’s make sure that we’re putting our resources where we say we want them to go.
1:19:12
Yes.
1:19:13
Great things are happening at the College of Agricultural Sciences in
1:19:17
what I think is really leadership in creating true inclusivity and support
1:19:23
and not just paying lip service and checking off boxes of diversity.
1:19:28
This is really about putting intent into action.
1:19:32
That action, I think, will have a direct impact on the student experience
1:19:36
in an incredibly positive way.
1:19:38
So, yay, College of Ag Science!
1:19:44
Can we talk a little bit about maybe your hopes for Students for Cultivating
1:19:50
Change at OSU and then the broader just your hopes for OSU in general in any way?
1:19:59
Yes.
1:20:00
In
1:20:03
terms of Students for Cultivating Change and the chapter at Oregon State
1:20:06
University, and I should mention there are five other chapters that exist in
1:20:11
the United States: Penn State, Ohio State, Virginia Tech, North Carolina
1:20:16
State, one other, and then there’s us.
1:20:20
We’re the first to exist west of the Mississippi.
1:20:24
That’s something to note as well.
1:20:29
The larger
1:20:32
vision for this student organization is that it always be truly led by students.
1:20:39
Robin and I are advisors.
1:20:42
We’re here to consult and advise.
1:20:45
We want students to make this student organization always
1:20:50
be what they need at the time.
1:20:56
We provide some of the consistency and resources along the way to
1:21:02
make sure that this organization always exists for students, but
1:21:06
students will always lead it.
1:21:07
That’s a very important thing.
1:21:13
One of the early conversations among some of the students who got involved
1:21:18
right off the bat was twofold: number one, to make sure that, or to develop
1:21:25
opportunities to connect with high schools so that College of Ag Science students
1:21:34
who are queer or queer allied, can connect with high schools in the area and maybe
1:21:41
around the state and maybe around the region [still to be developed] but to
1:21:46
say if you are queer or maybe you’re figuring out your identity right now
1:21:54
and you’re not sure if ag is the place for you we’re here to say that this
1:21:58
college is definitely a place for you.
1:22:01
You don’t have to worry about that because it’s a supportive environment.
1:22:07
The worst thing would be for a student who’s passionate about food science
1:22:11
or farming or fisheries and wildlife, all the different, broad areas of our
1:22:17
college to say I don’t want to go there because maybe they have the same kind of
1:22:21
assumptions, I had on my interview day.
1:22:25
Maybe they’ll choose a different route.
1:22:26
Maybe they won’t go to college at all because they’re not sure if they would
1:22:30
land in an environment that would really be supportive of their identity.
1:22:37
There’s a lot of potential for this group to do outreach to students
1:22:40
around the state at the high school level and to really put it out there
1:22:45
that they’re a strong community within the college for queer youth.
1:22:49
The other piece of it is to connect very strongly with different
1:22:53
sectors of industry and all of the different sectors of agriculture
1:22:57
again, whether it’s fisheries and wildlife agencies, whether it’s
1:23:05
the many different sectors of agriculture within the state of Oregon, we want to
1:23:11
develop relationships with employers and with ag leaders around the state
1:23:17
so that hopefully once a year Students for Cultivating Change will actually
1:23:22
lead a student tour connecting ag students who are part of the group
1:23:30
with leaders in agriculture who will give the message of yes, there’s
1:23:37
a place for you in this sector.
1:23:39
Yes, there’s a place for you in this part of ag industry.
1:23:44
Yes, there’s a place for you in this particular state agency or what have
1:23:49
you but to do it in regard to that queer identity specifically and making that
1:23:53
connection of support, so it’s about the connection between the pipeline
1:24:00
into college and then also the link to what happens to students after they
1:24:05
graduate and their potential future careers and where they might land.
1:24:10
This group consciously wants to bring all of those things together
1:24:14
and be the link between them.
1:24:16
I think there’s a tremendously powerful future in that for this group.
1:24:24
In regard to the larger university, my vision, my hopes, my dreams, my
1:24:28
desires, well I’ve already mentioned that I’m just so pleased to be a part
1:24:35
of OSU in general in terms of all the institutions within the state of
1:24:42
Oregon, I personally think that OSU is just a leader in so many different ways
1:24:54
in truly staying to its mission of prioritizing the education of Oregonians
1:25:02
and regionally, too, outside of the state.
1:25:06
I love being at, I’m a liberal arts person, and I love being
1:25:10
at a science university.
1:25:13
Yes, there are liberal arts within OSU, and I love that that’s present as well,
1:25:18
because I think it gives a full, rich embodiment of that learning experience.
1:25:25
Being able to sit in on some of the musical performances that happen at the
1:25:28
MU from our students and then also being able to go to some of the scientific
1:25:34
poster, research poster presentations that happen and that, again, incredibly
1:25:39
breadth of learning and talent.
1:25:43
I think that OSU,
1:25:50
my hope is that OSU will continue to prioritize its really unapologetic
1:25:58
efforts to, and it’s not that it’s always done perfectly, but I think that
1:26:04
there’s a conscious long-term effort to lead, to connect to that original
1:26:12
mission of educating the masses, if you will, of being accessible to
1:26:21
students regardless of background.
1:26:24
I think those efforts are expanding.
1:26:26
I think those kinds of priorities mean something different now
1:26:33
than they may have 60 years ago.
1:26:37
I think, again, not everything has always been perfect, but I think
1:26:41
there’s an overt effort to recognize what needs to be done differently and
1:26:49
how do we actually implement that.
1:26:51
It’s an institution of action.
1:26:53
That’s what keeps me here, rather than oh yeah, that’s a nice
1:26:58
priority, we got to get to that.
1:27:00
Can’t do everything all at once, but I do love the momentum and the future
1:27:05
potential of the university to lead in its inclusion efforts and I think that
1:27:13
ties directly to its land grant origins.
1:27:16
Again, not always a pretty history.
1:27:19
Got to recognize that.
1:27:21
But it can be a phenomenal future, and I do think that we’re
1:27:23
well on our way in that regard.
1:27:28
I plan on sticking around for a while.
1:27:30
I feel like I’ve already been able to have a role in building some really
1:27:35
great things and I’d love to see where I can go with it and where I can help the
1:27:40
institution and the college specifically make positive change for everyone.
1:27:49
Is there anything that you haven’t been able to share
1:27:53
that you really want to share?
1:27:57
I think
1:27:59
in terms of any closing remarks, I know that this is easier said than done and
1:28:07
I know that everyone’s circumstances are their own, so in no way do I mean to
1:28:15
imply that my situation or my approach to life is what everyone else should
1:28:20
do, but I would encourage you if you’re able to, if you’re able to hit the pause
1:28:25
button in a time of stress or indecision and take a deep breath and believe that
1:28:31
you are actually able to push through challenges, to embrace the adversity,
1:28:40
I think if you can find that strength if you’re able to pull the
1:28:44
resources together, even if they’re just coming from within your own
1:28:49
heart and soul, so much is possible.
1:28:53
If anybody puts a challenge or barrier in your way,
1:28:58
don’t let them have that power over you.
1:29:01
Push through.
1:29:02
Jump higher.
1:29:04
It’s exhausting at times, but I believe that so many of you listening to this can
1:29:10
find that within yourselves if, again, just hit that pause button and listen
1:29:14
to your heart and soul and push through.
1:29:17
That’s my advice.
1:29:19
Great things are possible in life.
1:29:23
I think a lot of us are stronger than we give ourselves credit for.
1:29:26
That would be my parting thought.
1:29:30
Alright, thank you for taking the time to sit here and just tell
1:29:35
me about yourself and letting everyone know how amazing you are.
1:29:40
[Laughs] Well, I will just also say that it’s been a pleasure and
1:29:43
an honor and thank you so much for the opportunity to share my story.
1:29:47
I hope that others take strength from it and happy to be reached if
1:29:52
anyone wants to connect with me.
1:29:54
Thank you so much.
