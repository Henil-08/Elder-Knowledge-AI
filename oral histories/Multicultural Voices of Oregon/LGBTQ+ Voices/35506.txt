00:02
Okay.
00:02
Great.
00:03
Looks like the mic is working.
00:05
Fantastic.
00:07
Looks like this is working, too.
00:11
Great.
00:12
And we’re live.
00:13
And we’re live.
00:15
Alright, great.
00:18
Now, I think
00:23
I
00:26
will sit here.
00:30
So, we will get into some ice breakers and to a main prompt.
00:34
Will you do us the honors of a land acknowledgment?
00:37
Yeah.
00:38
Absolutely.
00:39
So, we’re gathered here today on the homelands of the Mary’s River
00:42
or Ampinefu Band of Kalapuya.
00:44
Following European invasion and the Willamette Treaty of 1855, Kalapuya
00:49
people were forcibly removed from their lands and have been subjected to a long
00:52
[unintelligible] legacy of dispossession, displacement, oppression, assimilation,
00:57
and genocide which settler colonialism continues to perpetuate to this day.
01:01
We also want to acknowledge that queerness has been made other in
01:04
indigenous communities by colonialism and white settlers and that millions of
01:08
indigenous women and girls remain missing, abducted, and lost from their homes.
01:12
We extend love and gratitude to this land and its indigenous community.
01:16
Despite these challenges, Kalapuya peoples persist and continue to uphold traditions
01:20
through vitalizing and revitalizing songs, dances, languages of many local
01:25
dialects, ceremonies, gender experiences, worldviews, and fulfill various roles of
01:30
stewardship to contribute to a reciprocal relationship with the natural world.
01:33
The living descendants of the Kalapuya are represented within the Grand
01:38
Ronde Tribes of the Grand Ronde—I’m sorry—the Confederated Tribes of the
01:40
Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians.
01:45
Among these tribes are two-spirit Indigenous folks who navigations of these
01:48
intersectional identities are an act of resilience in itself worth celebrating.
01:53
Queer solidarity with local indigenous communities is essential
01:58
for liberating us all from colonial suppression and violence.
02:01
We must reflect on and act towards supporting indigenous sovereignty
02:04
and respecting indigenous lands.
02:06
We take this moment to give thanks to Marys River and Ampinefu Bands
02:09
of Kalapuya and their traditional homelands on which we stand.
02:12
May we center that this land, this community, and this world
02:15
has an indigenous past, indigenous present, and indigenous future
02:19
and you can learn more about whose land you’re on at native-land.ca.
02:46
Eli: So sorry, I need to sneeze.
02:48
I didn’t want to sneeze in the middle of the land acknowledgment or
02:48
BLM statement [laughs] . I’m good.
02:48
Good.
02:48
Were you able to pull it up?
02:48
I’m sorry.
02:48
It was one of those things where it was like
02:52
you think you need to sneeze and then it stops.
02:54
I apologize for that.
02:57
Yeah,
03:04
was anybody able to pull up the BLM statement?
03:11
Yeah, I can do the BLM Statement.
03:13
Great.
03:13
Yeah.
03:14
Okay.
03:15
We also want to take a moment to acknowledge that Black lives matter
03:18
with this quote from Alicia Garza, one of the co-founders of Black Lives
03:22
Matter: “When we say that Black Lives Matter, we are talking about the ways
03:25
in which Black people are deprived of our basic human rights and dignity.
03:28
It
03:30
is an acknowledgment that Black poverty and genocide is state violence.
03:35
It is an acknowledgement that one million Black people are locked in cages in this
03:39
country—one half of all people in prisons or jails—is an act of state violence.
03:44
It is an acknowledgment that Black women continue to bear the burden
03:48
of a relentless assault on our children and our families and that
03:52
assault is an act of state violence.
03:54
Black queer and trans folks bearing a unique burden in
03:57
a hetero-patriarchal society
04:01
that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and
04:05
profits off of us is state violence.” That was a quote from Alicia Garza.
04:12
Thank you, Eli.
04:16
My laptop is actually charging, so someone could bring up the ice breaker for me.
04:23
I remember what it was.
04:25
Oh, great.
04:27
Alright, so, to get started we’re going to go around the circle and
04:34
the ice breaker is if you were famous, what would you be famous for?
04:38
So, share that and your name and pronouns.
04:43
I guess that means I start [chuckles] . My name’s Eli.
04:47
I use they/them pronouns.
04:50
If I was famous, what would I be famous for?
04:54
I don’t want to be famous [chuckles]
04:57
.
05:00
in this hypothetical scenario,
05:04
I would want to be a famous Civil Rights lawyer or something, because
05:10
I want to go into law and that seems like a good thing to be famous for.
05:15
Hell yeah.
05:18
I’m Tali.
05:18
I use they/them pronouns, and, I’d probably be a rock star.
05:22
I
05:26
am Quincy.
05:28
I use ze, hir, and hirs pronouns.
05:30
What would I be famous for?
05:31
I think I would be, if I had to be famous, which does not sound
05:33
great, but I’d be famous for
05:38
something, like it’d be
05:45
for
05:48
something that I’ve written, at least I would like that.
05:56
So, a writer.
06:00
I’m Rose.
06:01
I use fae/faer pronouns.
06:05
What would I be famous for?
06:07
That’s a good question.
06:09
I don’t know, either something science-y.
06:15
I’m a biochemistry major, or social justice, I guess?
06:25
I’m [Anonymous] , she/they.
06:29
I guess I’d be famous for like doing a math thing [laughs] ? Like presumably
06:34
making something that’s useful enough that my name gets stapled to
06:38
it, and people will recognize it.
06:40
Like, I don’t feel like that’s famous, though, because like, except for who
06:44
even knows the mathematicians’ names except for other mathematicians?
06:48
You could make a transform.
06:50
Those guys always get their names on stuff.
06:57
There you go.
06:57
[Chuckles]
06:57
Xander, they/he pronouns, and I’d be famous for painting.
07:05
I’m Quinn, they/them pronouns, and realistically: streaming.
07:13
I stream videogames.
07:14
I just started, so I’m not out there at all, but I would love to be, and then this
07:20
could be a part of that but my dream would be voice acting, is doing voices and stuff
07:29
like that.
07:29
I’m Indigo.
07:30
I use they/them.
07:33
My first thought was that I’d be famous for being an art teacher.
07:36
I know a little bit of all these types of art and I’m famous for like
07:40
teaching and getting people into them and they get much better, but I have
07:52
a little bit of all of them.
07:53
Awesome.
07:53
Well, I just want to share a little bit of context, why we decided to
07:57
have a recorded session this year and a lot of it has to do with, one,
08:03
is legacy and preserving our legacy.
08:06
So, in comparison with history, which emphasizes the past, reflecting
08:11
on our community’s legacy reminds us that our experiences and our
08:15
stories as trans folks are ongoing.
08:18
The legacies of our elders and our ancestors inspire us and influence
08:22
our own lives to shape the world that we live in and the stories
08:26
and experiences will influence the lives of those who follow us.
08:30
All of the students that come after us, the trans folks, will have
08:36
something to build on and know that there’s already a legacy of trans
08:41
students here at this institution.
08:42
Institutional
08:45
memory is also really important, which, at social institutions, so like OSU,
08:51
that were not built for queer and trans people, especially queer and trans
08:54
people of color, it’s of increased importance that we take intentional steps
08:59
to preserve our legacies from systemic erasure and preserving our strategies
09:05
for acquiring resources, maintaining our community’s interconnectedness
09:09
and resilience and resisting systemic oppression and uplifting each other
09:13
makes navigating these institutions easier for those who come after us.
09:19
It’s important we retain continuously the efforts that we take to dismantle systems
09:25
of oppression from social institutions that exclude us in the first place.
09:37
I can do the prompt.
09:39
Alright, so, with that context, our prompt for
09:44
sharing today is: how do we retain resources and knowledge that
09:50
strengthen our community, both inside and outside of institutions?
09:56
How do we preserve our stories and ongoing legacies.
10:01
Do you have a personal example of resources, stories, and knowledge
10:08
being passed down to you or passing these things down to others?
10:16
Yeah, and, I guess since I shared the prompt, I can start and we can go around
10:28
the circle and share just a starting place on those questions and, again, if
10:35
someone wants to pass that’s all you need to say: pass, and that will be respected.
10:42
If
10:45
anyone does pass, just because they want more time to think, then we can have
10:51
a second round where we go back around and see if anyone wants to add anything.
10:56
Also, if y’all want a little more time to think about the prompt and let it sit-in
11:01
we could also write for a little bit.
11:03
I could grab some paper.
11:04
Yes.
11:05
That is also an option.
11:06
How are people feeling?
11:07
Are people ready to dive straight into the discussion?
11:10
Or do we want to kind of like think about the prompt a little bit?
11:16
I can also repeat the prompt.
11:18
Is the full thing what’s in the email?
11:21
Eli: I believe it should be.
11:25
Okay.
11:25
I believe I sent the full prompt in the email.
11:30
But not everyone has the email.
11:31
Yeah.
11:32
I’m ready to talk.
11:33
I’ve got my talking point ready.
11:35
Great, you do!
11:37
Please.
11:39
What I was going to say is that something about this, about the idea of knowledge
11:45
and these trans communities being passed down and stuff like that reminds me of
11:50
just like the knowledge of how to, I guess, medically transition or sometimes
11:55
socially transition, these kind of, or like what providers you can go to and
11:58
stuff like that, how like that typically and historically has not had a website
12:03
or a book or something you can go to, or you see a queer person or a trans
12:08
person in class or at a bar or something, and you’re like, oh shit—I’m like that.
12:12
So, you go talk to them and you’re like: hey, yeah, I think I’m like you,
12:16
so tell me your secrets [chuckles] . And they tell you what they know.
12:22
They’re like, yeah, go to this doctor.
12:23
Go to this hotel, maybe, historically.
12:25
All these kind of—but these kind of knowledges always come in my experience
12:30
where I know from other trans folks, they come from just like it is directly
12:35
passed down from trans people to trans people kind of information.
12:39
That’s how we’ve gotten by for, I don’t want to say time immemorial, but just like
12:39
that’s seemingly just in our contemporary times, at least, how we’ve all gotten by
12:45
and it’s
12:50
a very community-based thing.
12:51
Sometimes I’ll meet trans people who have been without community and they
12:55
don’t know how to—and they feel really frustrated, because they don’t know how
12:58
to do these things, like how to bind or to talk or how to put on makeup or
13:04
a whole bunch of these kinds of things.
13:07
But, that’s the first thing that I think of when I hear talking about
13:10
legacies and passing on trans knowledge.
13:19
Those networks are so important.
13:24
The thing about, I guess, having that be passed down instead of there being a
13:31
website or a book or something you can go to is, I guess that’s part of that is
13:38
like a safety thing, you know, keeping those spaces and places and processes
13:44
safe, but also that makes it so much more susceptible to being erased from history.
13:54
Currently, for my history class—and this isn’t me going, this is me responding.
14:01
Currently for my history class I’ve been trying to write a paper on the
14:05
history of abortion pre-1800s, and it's very much a similar thing, of
14:09
the knowledge was passed down orally through communal networks and there’s
14:13
so little, and it’s so frustrating.
14:15
Yeah.
14:20
Are we going this way?
14:22
Or this way?
14:23
Are you ready?
14:24
I can go.
14:24
Okay.
14:28
So,
14:31
I come from a place where I didn’t really have access to any kind of queer content
14:36
or representation or anything like that, so I really feel like I’ve just been
14:42
getting an avalanche of information in the past couple of years, and as I find
14:49
myself, as I find people similar to me.
14:54
Really, for me, I just want to be an advocate, that it’s okay whether you
15:01
can get mental help for it, whether you can get physical help for it, whether
15:05
you’re in a safe environment or not.
15:08
For me, the way that that comes through is writing.
15:11
My passion is creative writing, and so through
15:17
my goal is probably poetry and short story writing.
15:20
I just want to make these topics, like,
15:26
not
15:28
like well-known, but just put a spotlight that there are those
15:33
hardships, that this is a more or less a common thing that people can
15:39
experience and it’s not basically it’s not a sin to experience this stuff.
15:46
I feel like, but kind of touching on the point of having a written culture
15:51
down is like, I’m not scientific.
15:54
I’m not technical.
15:56
I can’t really put down the numbers.
15:59
I don’t do the research.
15:59
I just—I write what I feel, and I think that my voice could resonate with so
16:06
many people if I just put it out there.
16:09
That’s where I want my legacy to
16:16
be.
16:16
Beautiful.
16:16
That’s a really good legacy to
16:21
work towards.
16:26
I’ve been reading more trans fiction recently, and so I think for me that’s
16:32
where, like, even though the stories aren’t factual, there’s still truth to
16:39
them.
16:40
I think that that’s where I found wisdom from the trans
16:46
community being passed down.
16:48
For
16:50
me, just to say, I’d love to read your work when it comes out.
16:52
I’ll tag you all [laughs]
16:55
. Perfect.
16:55
I’m
17:05
not too sure what I could say of substance about my engagement with community
17:10
knowledge and legacy and so forth.
17:12
I’m the sort of autistic, that means I did a ton of research before I
17:19
fully accepted, yeah, no I’m trans.
17:22
All
17:25
of the, basically just the medical side of stuff and things like that.
17:30
Yeah.
17:31
I’m super glad the stuff is online.
17:33
I would have still been a confused weirdo if I hadn’t been able
17:39
to, you know, have some kind of
17:44
resource that isn’t a person that I could look and like, hey,
17:47
how do you tell if you’re trans?
17:51
But, I don’t know.
17:53
I feel like, I don’t feel like I’ve interacted with legacy in a way that’s
18:01
more meaningful than just being in pre-existing queer spaces and getting
18:08
informative content, in that respect.
18:14
Well, I think that is kind of like worth mentioning, is that in your
18:22
experience you got all this stuff from the internet, which is like a whole
18:27
amalgamation of research and people’s personal experiences, and I think
18:31
that, I guess that’s some important commentary on how the internet has changed
18:37
things for our community, massively.
18:42
I mean, like, you were saying, the fact that you can, even if you’re in a
18:49
physical space where that sort of stuff isn’t even remotely mentioned, let alone
18:54
accepted, you can at least theoretically have some amount of community, or
18:59
at least community knowledge online.
19:10
I guess I’m in the same boat as a lot of you were, you know, before I came
19:15
here I knew maybe 3, maybe even 4, trans people where I grew up personally.
19:28
No, it was 4.
19:32
You know, so I didn’t have access to a lot of that legacy before I came here,
19:40
like, a lot of it from the internet.
19:43
I knew a lot of trans people on the internet, and
19:50
[sighs] some of those spaces are really good.
19:53
Some of those spaces are really nice and really positive.
19:57
Some of them have been the most toxic spaces I’ve ever been in.
20:02
You know, it’s... I
20:08
don’t know what to say about that.
20:10
It is what it is, I suppose.
20:17
I’m thankful that I’m here now and that I have other trans people to talk
20:24
to in person, you know, and get that knowledge that’s been passed down.
20:33
I spend a lot of time thinking about this, because I ran into a situation
20:40
earlier today where it’s like I’m trying to research something and, oh
20:45
now, the archive for this is run by a TERF now, and the stories they tell
20:51
are not going to be necessarily all the stories that were there, right?
20:57
Or, even representative, maybe.
21:04
So, it’s like, it feels like no matter where you are it’s just so tenuous… To
21:18
have a way to wrap this up?
21:19
I don’t know.
21:21
I feel like I have thoughts on this.
21:24
Give me a second.
21:25
Yeah.
21:25
[Brief
21:31
Pause]
21:34
I guess, I’m thankful for those online resources, archives and stuff when
21:42
I was still, you know, closeted at home and I’m thankful for the ability
21:50
to talk to other trans people now and being out and maybe in different
21:58
ways.
22:00
Lovely.
22:03
Well, I think for me when I
22:11
think about preserving trans knowledges and legacies, I look back on my
22:20
relationship with my gran, who came out as a trans woman, at least to me in 2009.
22:32
Having that familial connection
22:38
gave me a lot of opportunities to learn from elders, from her, but also
22:47
from friends and trans communities that she met and was able to
22:51
introduce me to over time.
22:55
I had the opportunity, fortunately, before she passed away in 2021 to
23:00
actually do some oral history interviews with her about her life and it was part
23:08
of my undergraduate senior project.
23:15
I am so grateful that we have that recorded now.
23:21
I wish I had the opportunity to update it before she passed, but I still
23:27
have those recordings and I learned so much from what she was saying.
23:38
I think the biggest thing was after hours of interviewing, realized, well
23:47
she mentioned something that I found interesting that was identifying
23:53
with change, something that she said during her last interview.
23:58
I asked—this wasn’t on my interview question sheet—but
24:03
I asked what does that mean?
24:06
She pauses and says, this is going to sound weird, but I think if I have been
24:13
assigned female at birth I would have transitioned to male, and being fascinated
24:18
by these stories of change and physical transformation, even from childhood, being
24:26
fascinated by the movie The Fly, which is an old film where a man changes into
24:32
a fly or being fascinated by werewolves.
24:37
I went from there, and I guess the point is it made me realize that identifying
24:44
with change was okay and made me realize that, oh, maybe the stories I’ve
24:50
heard through primarily a cisgendered media, aren’t the only stories.
24:59
That left me open to finding more gender queer and non-binary stories and
25:04
realizing, oh that’s a possibility for me.
25:07
Of course, online archives and
25:12
resources there was helpful.
25:16
When I say archives, I don’t just mean archives at universities,
25:19
I mean also things on platforms like YouTube, for instance.
25:25
Although, for me it was mostly YouTube is where I found a lot of those.
25:29
I don’t think I would have made the connection as well if my gran hadn’t
25:33
said what she said during the interview.
25:36
Now I have that moment recorded forever.
25:40
I’m so glad that I do now.
25:48
That memory will live on, even though she’s gone now.
25:55
These are the things that I think about when I think about preserving our
25:59
knowledges and legacies as trans people.
26:07
Thanks
26:11
Quincy.
26:11
I have, like, just so many, so many thoughts on this subject, but what’s
26:17
coming up for me right now is—it might be kind of like a dark way to think
26:22
about it, but also a way that feels empowering for me is I think about Magnus
26:29
Hirschfeld, who was a German physician in the 1930s prior to World War II, and
26:37
he had a whole, I think it was called The Institute of Sexology I want to
26:41
say, but it was an entire library of information about trans patients and
26:48
transition and queer and trans health.
26:52
That was one of the things that the Nazis went to first to burn
26:58
and get rid of and destroy.
27:01
It makes me think about how powerful those resources were that
27:07
they felt so threatened by them that they had to destroy them.
27:11
It makes me feel really empowered to think that we have the opportunity,
27:17
especially at a learning institution, to create these resources and
27:23
get to share them with people.
27:25
I also think about, like,
27:29
I am a Jewish person and I was raised around a lot of talk about the Holocaust.
27:36
Everybody always talks about people’s shoes and stuff and one thing that really
27:39
stuck with me that I heard in Sunday school one week is that the shoes are
27:43
really important because each of those people were a story and many stories.
27:53
It reminds me of all of the stories that we lost and all of the stories that
27:57
didn’t get to be told, and I think of the AIDS epidemic, too, and how many people
28:01
were lost and how many stories were lost and how much knowledge was lost.
28:06
I think it’s so important that we get to be together and we get to talk
28:13
about these things and talk about our survival together and how we’ve been
28:19
able to persist through all of these affronts to our survival and just like
28:25
how powerful that is, that we’re here.
28:31
We have the strength to show up and do these things.
28:35
It’s what
28:59
comes up for me.
29:00
Certainly relevant these days.
29:00
Yeah, unfortunately.
29:00
I know.
29:00
Thank you for sharing that, Tali.
29:00
How do I follow up on that?
29:00
[Laughs] I don’t know.
29:01
When I look at the prompt I guess the first thing that comes up for me, the
29:03
most obvious thing, is I guess the ways that I feel that resources, knowledge,
29:11
and stories are passed down to me or have been passed down to me primarily, a
29:19
lot through my work in the Pride Center.
29:21
I just get to hang out with cool queer people all day, and they teach me things.
29:27
See, Tali, you’ve taught me a lot.
29:30
I’m
29:35
going to be an LL next year slash I’m kind of in LL now.
29:39
It’s a weird situation.
29:41
I
29:43
guess that means that I will be the one trying to pass on these,
29:51
kind of everything that I’ve witnessed us building within the past year,
29:58
two years now that I’ve been here at the Pride Center, like, all the work
30:04
with Trans Story Circles, you know?
30:05
We’ve been building up to try to get another archived
30:08
session since before I was here.
30:12
So,
30:14
trying to continue those types of work and also trying to make sure that,
30:21
I guess, there’s a lot of stuff that gets lost through the turnover of,
30:29
especially like a university setting, with the revolving doors of students who
30:35
move through these spaces and who aren’t usually here for more than 5 years-ish.
30:44
And so, I feel like the longer I’ve been here the more resources
30:49
and everything that I’ve been able to accumulate in my mind.
30:55
And so, I want to make sure the people who come after me
31:01
also know about those things.
31:03
Literally just today we got the updated trans phone book of resources that’s
31:11
a giant book this thick, and I didn’t even know that we had the original
31:16
one but now we have the updated one.
31:19
And, so.
31:21
Yeah.
31:22
That can be difficult, because the way things are now we don’t exactly
31:28
get opportunities to share things with
31:33
oncoming staff members all the time, certainly not as much as I think
31:39
we should to best prepare them.
31:41
We’ll get by and I guess in preparation for leaving next year I’m just going to
31:47
try and teach people as much as I can.
31:54
Those are my rambling thoughts on it.
31:57
Thanks, Eli.
31:58
You’re going to kick ass.
32:00
Thank you.
32:00
I know I can relate to what you were saying about and thinking
32:07
ahead to next year graduation.
32:12
I know that that’s something that’s on my mind as I’m about
32:16
to graduate very, very soon.
32:20
Too soon.
32:24
The effort I’ve been putting into making sure that those who are going on
32:32
can continue events like this and have the knowledge and resources to do so and
32:42
making sure that,
32:47
like for instance, my scrapbook pages actually get into the scrapbook to be
32:54
shared in the future and feeling more seriousness around that now that it’s
33:01
actually about to happen in a few weeks.
33:06
Boy, I can’t believe it.
33:11
I guess that’s a long way of saying I can relate to what you were
33:15
just saying about thinking about your work here and continuing and
33:24
preparing to pass the knowledge on.
33:33
We can definitely, like, open the discussion up a little more now.
33:40
Usually once we go around once we do that.
33:42
Yeah.
33:44
We also, like, if anyone listening to other folks had a story or an instance
33:50
that popped up while people were talking, feel free to jump in and share.
33:57
Yeah, anything that resonated.
33:57
Also, take a second to go get a little snack.
34:02
So, folks want to take a second to get a snack, now’s a good time.
34:07
I’ll get the mic and double check.
34:08
Yes.
34:09
Hello?
34:10
[finger snaps] . Okay.
34:12
It’s picking some stuff up.
34:16
We like play it back and it’s like [makes static noise]
34:18
. Honestly, that’s why I turned the fan off.
34:20
That’s what I’m worried about.
34:22
Oh.
34:23
I mean, you’ve got so much white noise from the ventilations
34:26
and the fluorescence.
34:26
[discussion regarding the recording equipment begins]
34:26
Is the camera working?
34:27
The numbers aren’t moving.
34:30
The numbers on the camera aren’t moving?
34:37
It looks...
34:40
yeah.
34:41
Maybe if someone could come take a look.
34:44
Okay, hang on a sec.
34:45
It’s
34:51
picking up sound.
34:52
It looks like it was running at first.
34:53
This little thing that says “A End”. I don’t know what that means.
34:55
The camera’s transphobic [chuckles]
34:55
. I guess it’ll... it looks like it maybe recorded sixteen minutes.
34:56
Okay, sixteen minutes was in the middle of your thing.
34:57
Do you remember what you were saying and we’ll just continue from there?
34:58
[Group laughs.]
34:58
Let’s redo it, yeah!
34:58
I mean, I guess there would be audio?
34:59
I mean, I had to explain one thing
35:02
about
35:11
like
35:29
I’m sure glad the internet exists.
35:31
Oh, boy.
35:31
The audio is the most important thing.
35:32
Okay.
35:32
Maybe it stops like that?
35:32
Do you know how to get it going again?
35:33
Let me just.
35:33
I was like, I’m sure glad the internet exists but, wow, some space is toxic.
35:38
Oh, the memory card is
35:42
full.
35:43
Ugh!
35:44
That’s why.
35:44
Whups.
35:45
The archives are transphobic.
35:49
[Laughs]
35:49
We have
35:52
the first sixteen minutes and we have the mic, so hopefully that will be
35:59
enough for the transcriber to know our voices, at least, hopefully–
36:06
The “trans”-scriber.
36:06
[Laughs]
36:06
–We should refer to each other by name as much as possible.
36:10
Right, as to make their life a little easier.
36:13
Yeah, and this looks like it’s still running, so
36:19
that’s good.
36:19
Anyone can continue.
36:19
I’m just going to make sure there isn’t like a memory card
36:22
in here or anything like that.
36:26
Maybe we could try to just say our names when we start talking.
36:29
Yeah.
36:30
That would be good.
36:33
Let’s do that.
36:33
That could probably get edited out
36:37
in the file transcript.
36:38
[discussion regarding the recording equipment ends]
36:38
We’re recording the legacy of trans people’s ability to adapt
36:42
to our non-ideal situations.
36:44
[Group laughter]
36:46
Who said that?
36:46
Right, exactly.
36:48
[Group laughter]
36:50
. It’s some person named Tali.
36:54
Tali, they.
36:55
You have to have the badge.
36:55
No but how do you pronounce the
37:00
parentheses?
37:01
It’s like a glottal stop [makes noise] if it’s just like.
37:03
Tali [makes noise]
37:03
. [Group laughs]
37:07
. I’m Rose.
37:08
I have to leave soon.
37:10
Okay.
37:10
I do want to say something.
37:12
Okay, yeah.
37:13
Say your thing.
37:13
At the risk of going on an autistic tangent, this makes sense in my head.
37:19
It may not be relevant in the reality.
37:21
That’s okay.
37:23
Disclaimer.
37:23
You know, I played a videogame
37:29
from like
37:33
2002 over the summer called Siberia.
37:35
The general plot is that
37:40
you’re like a lawyer who’s tried to track down a missing heir of a factory.
37:47
You go across all these different locations that he visited and there’s
37:54
very much a sense of you know it was in its heyday when he was there, and
37:58
everyone talks about this guy very happily who’s completely autistic coded
38:07
by the way.
38:07
We talk about, like wow, things were great when he was here.
38:14
It sure does suck that he’s gone now.
38:17
You go past a town that’s factory’s closing, not closing, but fallen on hard
38:23
times, a university that kind of had its heyday a while ago, abandoned city resort
38:31
that few people go to now, and I think about that like I want the university
38:40
to collapse 20 years after I leave.
38:43
It’s going to do that regardless of what I do.
38:47
I would like people to remember me, I guess, so that if in 20
38:52
years you came here and asked
38:56
was Rose here?
38:57
How was she?
38:58
And people will be like, oh, yeah, I remember when she was here.
39:01
She was really cool.
39:03
It’s sad that she’s gone now.
39:07
That makes sense.
39:09
I hope that for all our trans friends, you know.
39:17
I’m Indigo, and I think that in response to that whenever, like, my old community
39:25
in Eugene, whenever we’d be around, or a bunch of us hanging out and maybe someone
39:30
who’s trans or just one of those queer friends who’s like maybe passed on or
39:36
moved to a different town or something, we talk with them and we’re like—oh, shit.
39:39
I remember they taught us this.
39:41
I remember they were always talking about this, you know.
39:43
It was always things that they had taught to us that we would always remember and
39:46
be like, yeah, remember when we played Edward Fortyhands with them or something.
39:52
Do you remember when we played this drinking game or whenever we did this?
39:54
It’s just like, this kind of like context memories of things you shared
40:00
and lived together through I think always stick around, so I don’t know.
40:03
I just always remember just talking about it and being like, remember
40:08
when, just those kind of things.
40:10
I always feel hopeful or I feel bittersweet in those moments where I’m
40:14
like, oh, man, I miss that person a lot.
40:16
I feel a little envious.
40:17
I’m like, oh, I envy how people are talking about them.
40:20
I hope people talk about me that way.
40:20
Then I get hopeful and I go, you know, I think that whenever I move
40:20
on or you know, in this realm where I was from that people will talk
40:25
about me like this.
40:27
I
40:34
guess specifically
40:38
unless—oh, [Anonymous] speaking—I guess specifically and this less
40:43
building off the notion of personal legacy and in a slightly-less trans
40:47
specific context for that, for so much of my life I just didn’t really care
40:54
what would–not like I didn’t care–but what would the world be after I die.
41:02
I didn’t particularly give a shit if anyone remembered that I existed, and
41:07
more recently, especially with art I do, I realize that it is kind of
41:13
nice to know that something I made will continue to exist afterwards.
41:20
I’m not super sure.
41:24
I need to interrogate those feelings more, because I still very much like
41:29
identify with the notion, well, I’m dead.
41:32
I won’t care because I’ll be dead.
41:34
And… I’m not sure.
41:39
But you care now.
41:40
Yeah.
41:44
That matters, I think.
41:46
Yeah.
41:47
Hopefully someone got something out of that ramble.
41:48
No, I think that’s a fairly common experience of wanting that.
41:49
Yeah,
41:58
and I know you need to go, Rose.
42:00
Sorry, you’re like on the edge of your seat.
42:02
I do have to go.
42:02
I wish I could stay longer.
42:04
Thank you for being here for the start.
42:08
If you can come to the march tomorrow, 2:30, Kerr Hall,
42:12
we would love your presence.
42:14
Right on.
42:15
Thank you.
42:16
Welcome.
42:21
I guess speaking of the march, we can like not take it this direction if this
42:28
is not what we want to talk about, but I guess I was making that connection of
42:37
the current political climate for trans folks and all of that about the very
42:46
intentional erasure of our identities, our legacies, our stories, our presence and,
42:55
I guess, if people have thoughts on that and on resisting that.
43:04
Oh, that was Eli.
43:07
Yes.
43:08
From Indigo.
43:09
I’m always like, I find myself often in this struggle where I’m thinking
43:14
about resistance versus safety.
43:17
You could stay in a small town.
43:20
You could more to a more red state, you know, and be that trans idol and
43:26
that role model that, you know, you feel like there needs to be and make a
43:31
difference and all this kind of stuff.
43:33
Then you’re like, oh, shit.
43:34
I actually think that’s cool, but I like living sometimes.
43:40
Also living happily and thriving and I’m just living in this barrage of hate
43:46
every day, so then you—I think about migrating to redder cities, migrating
43:51
safety states and stuff like that.
43:53
Something about that, I don’t know, it just reminds me about different
43:57
oppressed people migrating that we hear about in history and stuff
43:58
like that, and it’s always like a whoa moment to think of me and all
44:05
the trans people I know moving to safety states and stuff like that and being
44:10
like shit, that’s what migrating is.
44:13
That’s what it was in history.
44:14
It was just someone going, you know,
44:19
do I want to?
44:20
Do I want to end up dying or do I want to be safe?
44:20
It’s kind of trip.
44:20
But, yeah, I think about resistance versus safety.
44:26
Yeah.
44:27
I recently had a conversation with a professor who was recommending
44:30
law schools, and I was like University of Idaho’s a deal.
44:33
I was like, I’m not going to
44:38
Idaho as a trans person [laughs]
44:39
. Not safe.
44:42
It’s not the worse state, maybe, but it’s not like Pacific Northwest Oregon.
44:54
Going off of that, and this is Quincy,
45:00
you talking about law schools, next steps, and how the current political climate
45:08
maybe is impacting the way that you’re thinking about your decisions about that.
45:11
I’m having a similar experience when it comes to being on the
45:17
job market, academic job market.
45:20
Often when you are an academic, especially early on, you don’t get a
45:25
lot of choice with where your life.
45:28
A lot of it is determined by who will take you.
45:32
I had a few interviews in Florida of all places that I took because, well, I have
45:40
to apply everywhere and this person is in my subfield, which is super specific.
45:47
I met them at this conference and they asked if I would apply, and I said, yeah,
45:51
because what else am I going to say?
45:54
And being like, well, if I must.
45:56
I must.
45:57
Luckily, one of those positions was a visiting position,
45:59
so very temporary anyway.
46:01
I was like ugh.
46:03
I have to say I was not crying when the rejection emails
46:08
came after those interviews.
46:09
I was like, okay.
46:11
No Florida.
46:12
You don’t have to go to Florida.
46:13
Yes.
46:16
I was like, okay.
46:17
Thank God, and also thinking this person who is in my very specific subfield, I
46:22
was like, why do you have to be there?
46:23
Why can’t you be somewhere else?
46:25
I’m
46:28
feeling a lot of pressure for interviews that are in safety states, like
46:34
Connecticut and being like, oh, please.
46:38
Please.
46:42
Yeah, and the stress of that, and
46:47
how it sucks that this is something that I need to think about.
46:51
It’d be great if I could just go anywhere without having to think about this.
46:56
It’d be great if I could go to whatever law school and not have to
47:01
worry, but we also need to stay alive
47:09
and, again, I can see, you know the argument, like when Indigo
47:13
was talking about being the person who makes that move going to
47:18
these places, making a difference.
47:21
I commend those people who can do that.
47:24
I don’t want to, and that is fair.
47:28
Also, the people who usually are successful at that are people who
47:33
already were there, are people who have a network to go to.
47:40
So, if anybody is going to do that, having that network I think is probably key.
47:47
If I knew folks, for instance, in Florida, then it’d be different, but I don’t.
47:54
Just thinking what a difference that makes, too, in the geography affects
48:00
this process as well, how much it’s playing into the current situation.
48:10
I was thinking about that when Indigo was sharing.
48:15
I’m
48:21
interested in—this is Tali—I’m interested in what folks think about,
48:29
pertaining to the political climate that’s going on and a lot of it targets
48:36
all trans people and adults, but a lot of it targets trans kids specifically.
48:42
I can already think of from my own experience growing up how little
48:47
resources there was around me and how challenging it was navigating internet
48:53
spaces, like you and Rose were talking about, and how there’s so much toxicity
48:58
there and finding the right resources.
49:01
I’m curious what people think of
49:05
what you want to pass down to trans kids right now, or what you wanted
49:11
to have passed down to yourself when you were a kid and stuff like that.
49:19
I really wish that I had at some point heard a trans person just talk
49:24
about what it, like, just the emotions behind it, because that would have
49:32
let me figure it out years sooner.
49:35
I just didn’t have context for what I was feeling and I wish I had to know for
49:41
look for that, and I wish that I had not had to look for that, but it had appeared
49:46
somewhere in an educational space.
49:48
I have a little bit of an anecdote.
49:54
This is Quinn.
49:57
I am currently a server at a restaurant, and there was one day that
50:01
a mother and her daughter came in.
50:06
They regularly come to the restaurant I work at.
50:09
Today they happened to bring a picture book with them.
50:14
It was about a unicorn who wanted to go sea diving to be
50:24
with the narwals.
50:24
While I wasn’t staring over their shoulder reading this book or listening to the
50:29
mom read this book, I heard enough of it that generally it’s a story about
50:35
changing your identity to what your mind says it is, as opposed to your body.
50:42
Obviously, that can apply to many things, but for me as a trans person
50:46
that spoke very kindly to the inner gender dysmorphia, essentially, and
50:53
wanting to surround myself with people that better fit with where my mind
50:59
is as opposed to where my body is.
51:02
I think those kinds of resources for kids, where it doesn’t have to be trans
51:09
coded, it doesn’t have to be, you know, it doesn’t have to have gay flags all over
51:16
it, just kind of promoting the idea that diversity is okay, that you can change
51:23
who you are, how you present yourself.
51:26
You can surround yourself with different people who accept you and love you
51:29
for who you are and even if–this gets a little bit out of kids’ book
51:36
territory–but even if that’s talking about found family rather than blood family.
51:43
I think those are all really good ideas to support for children so that
51:50
it almost can point them, as well, you were saying, towards this is
51:54
another thing that you can consider.
51:56
This is another thing you can look into and that’s okay to question those things.
52:00
I thought that was a... it was just really nice to see this mother with
52:05
her daughter exploring those ideas.
52:07
She even asked her, the mother asked the daughter at one point if she
52:12
felt she was a unicorn or a narwal, and I think she said something about
52:17
being a unicorn, but I also might be misremembering which character went where.
52:25
But just kind of supporting those questions, even if they
52:30
don’t, even if they don’t lead anywhere, it can help define a
52:34
sense of self for the child better.
52:48
I’ve got a lot of thoughts for this one.
52:49
This is Indigo.
52:51
As someone who works in childcare and as a teacher now, I have a lot of
52:56
thoughts of the ways that we can serve children and growing minds and bodies
53:00
to just teach them about themselves and have a more welcoming environment.
53:07
I want to start off by saying all the breeder talk would have
53:10
been cool to take that out.
53:12
I as a 6-year-old didn’t need to be asked about who I was going to marry
53:15
and how many kids I was going to have and what their names were going to be.
53:17
That would probably be step number one for letting me be a
53:20
boy or whatever I wanted to be.
53:25
Yeah, just all of that.
53:26
That’d be great.
53:28
More any kid can do anything kind of talk.
53:31
Any kid can like sport ball.
53:33
Any kid can like painting, stuff like that.
53:35
Just kind of encouraging the kids with whatever they’re liking.
53:40
That’s one thing I really enjoy doing now.
53:43
Just like, one thing I really enjoy doing now is any kid enjoying any activity,
53:49
even if their dog looks nothing like a dog when they’re drawing, going like: wow!
53:53
My gosh, you’re such an artist!
53:54
Look at you!
53:56
They go, oh, did you hear that teacher says I’m such an artist?
54:00
It’s so empowering, especially the kids who are more closed off and
54:03
just wouldn’t be praised normally.
54:05
So, I think that’s really important, just being a good educator.
54:11
Then I think... I mean I had this really good... right, I think taking kids
54:18
both more seriously and less seriously.
54:20
Kids, all the time as a child I was asking to be called by different
54:23
names, any other name in the book I could possibly think of and also
54:28
asking to cut my hair all the time.
54:30
Every time, like every month I was asking, asking, asking to
54:33
cut my hair, just shave it off.
54:35
It was always taken as a joke.
54:37
She would be like, oh yeah, ha, ha.
54:38
You’re so funny, as if, oh yeah whatever name change.
54:44
It cost like zero dollars and zero cents to call a kid Stanford or to just call
54:48
a kid just like whatever, you know, Unicorn-Butterfly for a day, you know?
54:52
It does not take a whole lot, and it can be so helpful for them.
54:56
Because one of those times, or any of those times, they’re going to go, cool.
55:01
I can choose my own name, because my own name, like my birth name,
55:03
makes me uncomfortable so I get to choose whatever I want and that’s
55:06
step one, like having that power.
55:09
Whenever I’m working with my kids, they’ll come up with—they think that I have a
55:13
very fun and exciting and silly name.
55:15
I’ll go, yes I do.
55:16
I chose it.
55:17
I chose it to be that way.
55:19
They go, oh.
55:20
Okay.
55:21
Well, can my name be like—I’m not very creative right now—but
55:23
can my name be Butterfly?
55:24
I go, for sure, Butterfly.
55:25
How are you?
55:27
It’s like taking them very seriously, but also it’s not
55:30
this huge, earth-ending deal.
55:33
It’s just like, yeah.
55:34
I’ll call you Butterfly today and I’ll check back in tomorrow.
55:37
Maybe tomorrow you’re going to be Lightening McQueen or something, but
55:42
take it just day by day and giving you that power, because that’s my job,
55:46
to show you that you have that power.
55:48
That’s
55:58
what I think of.
55:58
Excuse me just sec.
56:00
Do you have anything?
56:01
Yeah, this is Xander.
56:03
So, I’m graduating next month and I’m going into a profession where there’s
56:09
not enough queer or trans people,
56:15
that are in veterinary medicine.
56:18
So, I know it’s one of those careers that a lot of kids are really interested in.
56:25
Everyone, I think, at some point wants to be a vet in their childhood, and I
56:31
think if when I was a kid I’d see queer and trans vets being successful, being
56:38
normal, being bad but still being good people, bad at their jobs but still
56:44
good people, I think that would have been really helpful just to see that
56:50
you can do whatever job you want to do or whatever profession
56:56
whatever life work and be yourself.
56:59
You don’t have to change yourself
57:02
to do what
57:19
you want to do.
57:19
I think that would have been really helpful.
57:19
[Brief silence]
57:19
I didn’t really figure out that I was trans until I was halfway through
57:24
high school, so I kind of feel like
57:31
I don’t know what I would pass on to my younger self, you know?
57:36
Because like
57:38
they weren’t even thinking about that
57:49
[laughs]
57:51
. Could you think of things that, because I think– I’m
57:54
Indigo– that coming out in the middle of high school is pretty early.
57:57
Oh, I didn’t come out
58:01
[laughs]
58:02
. Sorry, I mean to yourself.
58:03
Knowing that you’re trans in the middle of high school seems pretty early, honestly.
58:07
What are things that you appreciated and that helped you early in your childhood?
58:15
I think the main thing that helped me figure it out once I was in high school
58:19
was just being around other queer and trans people and the visibility of it
58:26
and talking with people about their identities and stuff and being eventually
58:32
like, maybe I kind of feel like that.
58:35
Maybe I kind of, even if I don’t have really, really intense body
58:40
dysphoria or something, or dysmorphia.
58:45
Even if I don’t have those feelings, maybe it’s okay to just want to seek to
58:54
be like that because that’s where I’m comfortable at, not because where I was
59:01
before I was exceedingly uncomfortable existing like that, but just because I
59:09
liked it better one way than the other.
59:11
It wasn’t really more than that for me.
59:16
Yeah.
59:21
I don’t know.
59:21
But yeah I didn’t... I figured it out halfway through high school,
59:25
and I didn’t come out until I moved halfway across, entirely across
59:29
the country [laughs] . Completely new people, new name, new pronouns.
59:37
[Door
59:41
opens and closes]
59:42
Hello.
59:44
Are you here for Trans Story Circles?
59:54
Yeah.
59:55
Is it okay if I sit next to you?
59:57
Please.
59:57
I had to finish some OSU stuff first.
59:59
That’s fair.
1:00:00
Yes.
1:00:01
Fair.
1:00:02
So, we’ve currently got a recorder going.
1:00:06
This is going to be recorded for the archives.
1:00:09
I’m cool with that.
1:00:11
Yeah, just wanted to make sure.
1:00:13
Later on...
1:00:13
And also, we do have the consent form at some point as well, and
1:00:21
I can talk you through that.
1:00:24
I’ve signed a couple for the university before.
1:00:28
So, you know the drill.
1:00:29
Yeah.
1:00:30
Yeah.
1:00:32
Do you want us to reread you the prompt we’ve been discussing?
1:00:35
Yes.
1:00:36
That would be helpful.
1:00:37
Yeah, and, of course, you should introduce yourself with name and pronouns as well.
1:00:40
Oh yeah.
1:00:43
Okay.
1:00:44
I’ll read the prompt and then you can introduce yourself.
1:00:47
If you have any immediate thoughts, you can feel free to share them.
1:00:50
If not, you can mull it over.
1:00:54
So, the prompt we’re discussing is—how do we retain resources and knowledge
1:00:59
that strengthen our community both inside and outside of institutions?
1:01:03
How do we preserve our stories and ongoing legacies?
1:01:06
Do you have a personal example of resources, stories, or knowledge
1:01:10
being passed down to you or passing these things down to others?
1:01:17
My name is, I mostly go by Bones with those who are in
1:01:23
the community or I’m close to.
1:01:26
My pronouns are it/its, mostly.
1:01:29
I also use they/them and he/him, but prefer it/its.
1:01:34
As far as the prompt goes, what comes to mind is hearing stories passed
1:01:44
on through the mouths of people I’m close to, my family members.
1:01:50
Like finding out about queer relatives through my mom talking about it after
1:01:55
I came out, which wasn’t as helpful as if I knew beforehand [chuckles]
1:02:06
. That’s what I have so far for a prompt.
1:02:12
That makes sense that’s, kind of, come up, the sort of communal
1:02:18
word-of-mouth aspect of our identities.
1:02:24
If you have more thoughts, feel free to jump in and add them.
1:02:26
We’re kind of in an
1:02:29
open discussion-type part of the story circle at the moment.
1:02:34
You actually gave me a great lead-in.
1:02:37
Oh, this is [Anonymous] talking, in that I was also thinking about in
1:02:42
terms of queer legacy, like I’m not the first queer person in my family.
1:02:47
I’m the first trans person, but one of my aunts is gay and I feel like that
1:02:53
having already happened before I was born.
1:02:59
Then that there was like, and the amount of maybe this kid is less-so,
1:03:06
oh maybe they’re trans, more like maybe they’re gay or something, but
1:03:13
for all that
1:03:18
growing up you get a lot of social messaging from society
1:03:24
being your assigned gender.
1:03:27
There was less of that, at least to begin with, when I was growing
1:03:33
up and when I was in preschool I had a dress and rainbow sandals.
1:03:40
Then I just got too terrified to acknowledge that I
1:03:42
wanted that to continue.
1:03:45
I don’t know.
1:03:45
Having that freedom early on was something I probably shouldn’t ignore.
1:03:51
It is a form
1:03:56
of queer legacy, so.
1:03:57
I guess part of what I’m getting from that to reiterate is that those
1:04:04
previous family members being in your family and being queer kind of like
1:04:10
made it so your family was a bit more tolerant and accepting and just safer?
1:04:16
I feel like more than just tolerant and accepting, like
1:04:18
aware that it’s a possibility.
1:04:20
Yeah.
1:04:26
This is Quinn.
1:04:27
But to kind of almost show the opposite side of that, since I come
1:04:32
from a background who didn’t have anyone prior LGBT, at least out
1:04:37
or self-aware in either regard.
1:04:40
I have theories.
1:04:43
[Group laughter] Anyway, I
1:04:46
as a child I very similarly was allowed to dress how I wanted to dress: just graphic
1:04:53
t-shirt and shorts baby all the way.
1:04:58
That really continued.
1:05:00
My parents never... they would maybe give comments, like, oh you should
1:05:04
wear dresses more often or you should wear skirts or anything like that.
1:05:07
But I think it was just really empowering to me that I was always
1:05:12
able to pick out what clothes I wanted.
1:05:15
I think even though it was most likely always from the girls’
1:05:20
section, I could still pick the shorts in the girls’ section.
1:05:24
I could still pick the Minecraft or Jurassic Park t-shirts in
1:05:28
the girls’ section, right?
1:05:31
So, even if it was limited my parents still supported that.
1:05:37
I think that’s another almost legacy thing that we should continue to embrace,
1:05:43
is if you have a child and they want to wear a dress, let them wear a dress.
1:05:47
If they want to wear cargo shorts, maybe have a talk, but
1:05:53
let them wear cargo shorts.
1:05:55
[Group laughs]
1:05:57
. Understandable.
1:05:59
Right, just taking away the importance that certain types of clothes are gendered
1:06:06
and that it’s okay to explore personal taste in fashion, even from a young age.
1:06:15
Just going off that, even communicating that while clothes themselves
1:06:21
are not automatically gendered, it’s okay to get some pleasure
1:06:26
out of how they are seen, too.
1:06:29
If it’s giving you gender euphoria, that’s a thing.
1:06:32
Like go for it, yeah.
1:06:33
Yeah.
1:06:33
And that is lovely.
1:06:35
Now, of course, do not say to other people they should be feeling for themselves
1:06:41
or that only a certain, well, only a certain gender can wear certain things.
1:06:48
But, hey, if this person’s getting gender dysphoria—I mean, not
1:06:51
dysphoria, euphoria, embrace it.
1:06:56
That’s cool, too.
1:07:00
Also, about the cargo shorts [chuckles] . As someone who never got a chance to wear
1:07:05
those as a teenager, I’m doing it now.
1:07:09
[Group laughs]
1:07:09
. At least for now,
1:07:14
just because.
1:07:17
Oh, and that was Quincy by the way.
1:07:20
How can you resist the allure of so many pockets?
1:07:22
I know, right?
1:07:24
The thing you’ve been deprived.
1:07:30
I just realized what I was going to say was supporting
1:07:33
crime, which I do–not support.
1:07:37
I do support petty crime, but pockets make it easier to take stuff
1:07:49
[laughs] . Yeah.
1:07:49
[Gasp]
1:07:52
That’s personally were I keep all my genders.
1:07:54
Oh.
1:07:56
In your cargo shorts pockets.
1:07:57
How many have you collected so far?
1:07:59
I can’t disclose that on record.
1:08:02
[Group laughs]
1:08:02
. [Unintelligble, repeats in 4 lines]
1:08:04
How many genders you have?
1:08:05
That’s just a secret of the trade.
1:08:07
Uh-huh.
1:08:07
Oh, okay.
1:08:10
No experimental genders that you’re under NDA?
1:08:21
[Group laughs]
1:08:23
. Experimental genders [chuckles]
1:08:23
. I mean...
1:08:24
The best kind.
1:08:25
This is Bones speaking, on like experimental genders.
1:08:29
For me, it’s really interesting being on the spectrum, autistic
1:08:38
speaking, and gender, because gender is such a societal construct.
1:08:44
I don’t really have this grasp of what gender is supposed to be?
1:08:53
A lot of the rules seem very arbitrary, very pick-and-choose.
1:08:59
So, for me growing up I only started to experience dysphoria when my body
1:09:07
started to develop, but I also just didn’t recognize that was dysphoria
1:09:13
until meeting other trans people who were like that’s not a normal thought
1:09:20
process, that’s not what cisgender people think about their bodies.
1:09:29
That later developed into me being more comfortable with neopronouns and this idea
1:09:37
of being genderqueer versus being binary.
1:09:44
Yeah, Indigo.
1:09:45
I was going to say it’s really hard for me to describe my gender experiences
1:09:50
growing up without describing my autism experiences growing up, because I’m
1:09:53
thinking about my mom, not forcing me but forcing me to wear certain types
1:10:00
of clothings and stuff like that.
1:10:03
She wanted a daughter daughter, like a girly girl Barbie daughter.
1:10:08
Which was great for me,
1:10:11
but, no, and so she always wanted these, all these dresses and skirts
1:10:15
and these sandals and stuff like that, but it’s like they would give me the
1:10:20
ick in a gender way but also it’s just like those things are usually made out
1:10:23
of cheap and weird, awful material.
1:10:27
It feels terrible on your skin, so I would have like a literal,
1:10:29
it’s like it was it a gender meltdown, it was an autism meltdown.
1:10:32
I’m just like not wanting, because it feels so terrible to be in
1:10:35
these clothes and also sandals, it’s like, southern California.
1:10:39
You’re sweating and you’re getting grimy all over your feet, so it’s like it gets
1:10:42
in your toes and so, I was like, no.
1:10:44
Tennis shoes every day, please and thank you.
1:10:46
It’s so hard to know which is which, both in that way where you’re like
1:10:51
this is, that Bones said, this is a social construct, so it’s like,
1:10:55
you know what does gender even mean?
1:10:56
Then also it’s just there’s so much about these weird roles being put onto you that
1:11:01
you’re like physically and emotionally just like, uck, I don’t like this.
1:11:05
This is not what I want to do.
1:11:07
I can’t wear this skirt because I want to go running.
1:11:09
You’re telling me I can’t run and play soccer when I’m in this
1:11:11
skirt, so get me out of this skirt.
1:11:13
What are you talking about?
1:11:15
[Chuckles] . It’s a bunch of stuff like that where it’s so hard to start,
1:11:18
you know, take these two things apart.
1:11:24
This is Quincy speaking.
1:11:24
Why it’s even necessary to pull them apart to begin with.
1:11:30
I feel like—oh,
1:11:36
this is [Anonymous] speaking—there’s a distinction between something being
1:11:40
uncomfy for reasons of internal, like it just feels gross and it would be
1:11:46
uncomfy in a vacuum and uncomfy because of things that society ties to it.
1:11:53
Like, gross clothes, sure, don’t feel awful, like even if
1:12:00
you’re in like a place where,
1:12:05
even if you don’t, are unaware of any notions of gender or lack thereof
1:12:09
associated with clothing, or you can have something that feels fine but
1:12:14
makes you sad because it means you’re
1:12:18
being perceived in a way that you don’t like and that internal, external
1:12:20
dynamic is a useful distinction.
1:12:25
Right.
1:12:26
Again, when I say maybe they don’t need to be taken apart, that’s an important
1:12:32
distinction, yes, in a general sense.
1:12:36
But I’ve also seen the conversation where people who are not autistic and
1:12:42
not trans keep demanding that autistic trans people explain themselves a certain
1:12:47
way and they take it all apart or just be autistic now or just be trans now.
1:12:54
It has to be explained as one or the other.
1:12:58
So, when I say it doesn’t need to be necessarily
1:13:04
taken apart, I’m talking about more like on that level.
1:13:09
But, yes, on a general level probably asking like why something
1:13:13
might feel uncomfortable and making the distinction’s probably useful
1:13:17
for other kinds of questions.
1:13:19
You know, as [Anonymous] was saying.
1:13:23
So, I just wanted to make that clear.
1:13:37
Does any folks have any other thoughts?
1:13:41
This is Bones again.
1:13:43
Something that made me think of is I’ve had to explain why I use it/its
1:13:50
pronouns to so many different people,
1:13:56
and it’s hard, because it’s just what I feel comfortable with.
1:13:58
There’s not really much more than an explanation than it gives me gender
1:14:04
euphoria, but they always seem to expect some in-depth explanation of, like,
1:14:11
trial and error or overcoming something.
1:14:16
It’s like, it literally just makes me more happy than they/them.
1:14:23
Yeah, sure, there’s maybe some other reasons, too, but at the
1:14:27
end of the day it just provides me that gender euphoria that I need.
1:14:35
I don’t know if anyone else has struggled with that who use neopronouns, but, just
1:14:41
the constant having to, even to people who are already trans and in the community who
1:14:48
are asking you why you use these pronouns.
1:14:51
It’s like hard to conceptualize, because it is literally
1:14:56
just, it causes me euphoria.
1:14:58
That’s it.
1:15:00
To tag on that, I talk about this every day.
1:15:03
It’s one of the most radical things I feel like I do in my work with children.
1:15:07
I work in K-1,
1:15:10
and I dress all types of gender.
1:15:13
I dress big.
1:15:14
I dress low.
1:15:15
All these kind of things, colors.
1:15:17
I come to work in just all black, like, you know, emo.
1:15:21
Just all this kind of stuff.
1:15:22
Stuff that teachers don’t look like.
1:15:25
Whatever.
1:15:26
Especially not a
1:15:29
Corvallis teacher [laughs] . That’s not how they look.
1:15:31
So, I go to class and all my K-1s are very interested [that stands for kindergarten
1:15:36
and first-graders], and they ask me.
1:15:39
Every day they ask me about something else.
1:15:41
Today the question was why is my hair so crazy.
1:15:43
Other
1:15:46
days it’s like why am I wearing a dress?
1:15:47
Why am I wearing a tie-dye skirt.
1:15:49
Why am I doing this?
1:15:50
Why am I doing that?
1:15:51
My answer every time is, oh, because I like it that way.
1:15:54
Every time I go, oh, I like it that way.
1:15:58
Sometimes they’ll ask more and they’re go like, well, I don’t like it that way.
1:16:02
I go, oh.
1:16:03
Well, hold on.
1:16:04
Is it on your body?
1:16:06
They go, no.
1:16:08
I go, well, that’s good.
1:16:08
Is it on my body?
1:16:08
They go, yeah.
1:16:09
I go, do you think I like it?
1:16:10
They go, yeah.
1:16:10
I will, it’s great it worked out that way.
1:16:13
But, just like, and then asking them more feels really radical.
1:16:18
Whenever they’re trying something that’s new, a lot of my kids, you know, boys and
1:16:21
girls alike, I’ve noticed in my classrooms will start to wear different makeups.
1:16:25
They’ll come to class in color ChapSticks and they’ll have it all
1:16:28
over their cheeks and stuff like that.
1:16:30
I go, like, oh my goodness.
1:16:31
Are you serving a look?
1:16:32
Look at you.
1:16:33
How do you feel?
1:16:34
They go like, I’m glad you noticed.
1:16:36
You know, like, I’m trying something.
1:16:37
I’m like, yeah.
1:16:40
One of their classmates, will go, like, oh, I think just the other day, last week,
1:16:43
I saw where their classmate was like, oh, why do you have lipstick on your eyebrows?
1:16:46
They were like, because I like it.
1:16:48
I was like, hell yeah you do.
1:16:51
Hell yeah, you do.
1:16:52
No, I think it’s really radical.
1:16:54
It’s so empowering not to have to explain yourself, and just go because I like it.
1:16:57
Period.
1:16:58
What are you going to do?
1:16:59
You can’t tell me that I don’t like it, because I know that
1:17:02
I do [chuckles] . Like, what?
1:17:04
But, no, I really feel that.
1:17:05
I don’t feel that for neopronouns, obviously that’s
1:17:09
not my experience, but having a different agenda that people aren’t used to.
1:17:16
I mean, not even– oh, this is [Anonymous] speaking – not even for neopronouns.
1:17:21
Most of my directions with my parents are in Hebrew, which is very much a language
1:17:25
that does not support pronouns other than he and she, because you need to conjugate
1:17:31
verbs and adjectives to gender people.
1:17:36
So, the fact is having to explain that yes I’m a girl, but I also like
1:17:42
they/them pronouns and it’s just,
1:17:48
it’s not they/them in a girl way.
1:17:51
It’s just they/them and I’m also a girl.
1:17:56
Yeah, that took a while for them to understand.
1:18:01
I feel like that’s also something that happens with
1:18:04
other gendered languages, too.
1:18:06
The notion of having something other than binary pronouns is
1:18:13
comparative, is on the same level of radical in neopronouns in English
1:18:22
and so forth.
1:18:22
I’m sorry, I have to leave, but thank you.
1:18:23
Yeah.
1:18:23
Thank you.
1:18:24
Thank you for joining.
1:18:25
Thanks for coming.
1:18:27
Thanks for having us.
1:18:28
And congratulations on graduating.
1:18:41
Congrats!
1:18:43
The couches are unbalanced.
1:18:45
Thank you for bringing people into the circle.
1:18:49
I
1:18:52
don’t know.
1:18:54
Oh, were you
1:18:57
going to say something at some point?
1:18:58
Uh, I don’t know.
1:18:58
My brain’s a little fried.
1:19:00
It’s week 9.
1:19:00
It is week 9.
1:19:03
Yeah.
1:19:06
It is week 9.
1:19:07
After I, oh, this is Eli.
1:19:11
After I
1:19:13
graduated, came out and everything I was also working with kids,
1:19:18
fifth-graders and seventh-graders.
1:19:24
I never really got to explain things to my seventh-graders, but
1:19:31
the fifth-graders who I was with at the start of the school year, I kind
1:19:34
of like drew a little gender spectrum on the white board and it was like
1:19:40
this is what you think of as girl.
1:19:43
This is what you think of as boy.
1:19:45
I’m kind of like the purple in the middle.
1:19:47
At
1:19:52
the time I was really figuring myself out and kind of like
1:19:56
experimenting with gender fluidity.
1:20:00
I think there’s maybe still an element of fluidity
1:20:04
a bit, but like I’d kind of like, after a year of waking up and trying
1:20:14
to be like, okay, what gender do I feel today so I can respond when
1:20:19
people ask me what gender do you feel today, I was like it’s too much work.
1:20:25
It’s too much energy.
1:20:26
It doesn’t come intuitively every morning and so I just use they/them pronouns for
1:20:31
most of the time, because it’s easiest.
1:20:35
However, one of the best things to come out of that was there was this
1:20:40
one fifth-grader, and I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but
1:20:45
he for the entire rest of the school year, every time he saw me, he was
1:20:51
like: Miss Eli what are you right now?
1:20:54
He would ask me what I’m feeling, what are my pronouns.
1:20:57
I was just like this is so pure and good and I love this child.
1:21:01
I
1:21:04
love that.
1:21:05
Yeah.
1:21:11
I don’t know, you were talking about kids and that reminded me of [sigh]
1:21:16
the pre-pandemic days in Boston.
1:21:18
Yeah.
1:21:19
No, I could talk about kids all day long but we’ve got other people here.
1:21:29
Definitely kids, and less adults, have made a big deal about gender.
1:21:36
They definitely
1:21:40
on their own seem to be more receptive most of the time.
1:21:44
Honestly, thinking about
1:21:49
what I did as a child was just to
1:21:55
have that just continue for as long as possible.
1:22:01
Also, for someone
1:22:04
to tell me as well as a teenager
1:22:11
that it is going
1:22:14
to be okay.
1:22:19
Also, as an intersex person it would have been great to know that
1:22:22
puberty does not happen in these very straightforward binary ways
1:22:26
like we usually explain it to kids.
1:22:30
That would have been wonderful,
1:22:33
and to also have had conversations with my doctor about how I was feeling as well.
1:22:41
It would have been great to have had
1:22:46
somebody just explain to me that things can be fluid.
1:22:49
Like that kid seems to understand and that that is okay and have somebody
1:22:56
just ask, like, where ya’ at right now?
1:23:00
You know?
1:23:01
Who knows?
1:23:02
Maybe my medical decision still would have been similar, maybe not.
1:23:07
I’m trying to suss that out.
1:23:09
I don’t know, but it would have been good.
1:23:12
Yeah.
1:23:13
I
1:23:17
guess that’s something that I hope I did for those kids, you know, even though
1:23:23
I wasn’t in their lives for very long.
1:23:25
I was an example of a person just being out and figuring out gender
1:23:34
and being very straightforward about that, and so I don’t know.
1:23:38
Maybe if any of them are ever having those thoughts or feelings they’ll
1:23:41
think of me and they’ll be like, okay, there are people out there who are like
1:23:48
that.
1:23:48
So.
1:23:49
Yeah.
1:23:49
Lately I’ve been getting some joy—I don’t know why I’m getting this joy.
1:23:53
It’s something I’m going to suss out in therapy, but I’m getting joy
1:23:55
because I have different kids that come to me lately and they tell me
1:23:58
about how mad their parents are.
1:24:00
I’m like, yeah.
1:24:02
I bet they are.
1:24:03
[Laughs]
1:24:03
. Yeah.
1:24:03
Kindergarteners.
1:24:06
You know?
1:24:07
That’s fair.
1:24:08
It’s not fair, but it’s like I’m glad they’re talking about it.
1:24:12
I’m like, cool.
1:24:12
It doesn’t always come out directly, either, because K-1
1:24:15
have like a really distinct way of talking, and it’s not direct.
1:24:17
But, no, and so I’ve been embroidering these shorts that I’ve just gotten because
1:24:23
the sun’s coming out and stuff like that.
1:24:26
I’ve been embroidering these.
1:24:29
Ooo.
1:24:29
So pretty.
1:24:29
Every time I embroider something on them I just think about how mad
1:24:33
it’s going to make these parents [chuckles] . I’ve got the rainbow.
1:24:37
I want to put the inclusion colors on here, too.
1:24:40
Are the parents mad because of you?
1:24:42
Oh, yeah.
1:24:43
[Laughs]
1:24:43
. I’m not surprised.
1:24:44
I’m not surprised, but.
1:24:46
My kid is being taught by this, what even is this person’s gender?
1:24:50
They can’t even, it’s blowing their minds.
1:24:52
I know, because I go by Teacher Indigo, which is explicitly not Mr. or Mrs.
1:24:56
Like, sometimes parents meet me, and they go like, oh, cool what’s your name?
1:25:00
You look different.
1:25:01
What’s your name?
1:25:02
I go, like, oh yeah, I’m Teacher Indigo.
1:25:04
Or, I go, I’m Indigo.
1:25:05
They go... because a lot of the kids just call me Indigo,
1:25:09
which is also informal.
1:25:10
I love how it breaks the barriers.
1:25:12
The parents will go, like oh, cool.
1:25:14
So, what do the kids call you?
1:25:15
I go, they call me Teacher Indigo.
1:25:18
They go, just like, they’re just mad.
1:25:20
They’re like, uh-huh.
1:25:22
I’m like, I know you want to ask a pronoun question or
1:25:25
something but you don’t know how,
1:25:29
but I’m not going to do it for you because it’s not my job.
1:25:31
But, no, and so then kids ask me all the time, less so because I’ve been there
1:25:35
all year, but they ask me all the time, they go—oh are you a boy or a girl?
1:25:38
I go, it’s both.
1:25:39
That’s all.
1:25:40
It’s just K-1.
1:25:41
They go, oh, are you a boy or a girl?
1:25:42
I go, both.
1:25:43
Some kids go, oh.
1:25:44
Well, of course.
1:25:45
Some kids go, no.
1:25:47
I don’t think you heard me.
1:25:48
So, what I said was... and I go, yeah.
1:25:49
No, I said
1:25:53
what I said.
1:25:53
Just whatever.
1:25:54
A couple of times, kids would come back the next day and they
1:25:57
go, so, my mom said you’re not.
1:26:00
[Laughs]
1:26:00
. I go, oh, interesting.
1:26:01
Tell me more.
1:26:02
Tell me more about what your mom thinks of me.
1:26:04
Tell me more about what your mom thinks, yeah.
1:26:06
They go, well, my mom said that you’re born as one or the other.
1:26:09
I go, oh, well.
1:26:11
They go, so, which one are you.
1:26:12
I go, well, I’m still both [laughs]
1:26:17
. You know.
1:26:18
Good luck.
1:26:19
I’m exactly where I want to be as far as my body and transitioning and stuff
1:26:23
like that, where you just cannot tell which way I come from unless, like, you
1:26:27
know me or you’re trans or something.
1:26:29
Just like, this cis cannot figure me.
1:26:32
So, I’m like, yeah.
1:26:33
No.
1:26:33
I will never tell you.
1:26:34
I’m just both.
1:26:35
I wish I had an adult like you in my life when I was younger,
1:26:40
because I didn’t meet another trans adult until I, too, was an adult.
1:26:47
So, it would have been so nice to even just get to meet one as a kid, because
1:26:56
it would have left a lot less doubt in my mind that what I’m doing is okay.
1:27:06
That’s what I hope.
1:27:06
I recently started telling a few kids, because like, I usually just
1:27:09
say I’m both, and that’s fine.
1:27:11
Sometimes kids like in first grade especially we talk about it more.
1:27:15
They go like, oh, well, what does that mean for you?
1:27:17
I go, well, you know, here are some things that are boy things.
1:27:20
Here are some things that are girl things.
1:27:21
Well, I like all of them.
1:27:22
I’m just too big to put in a box.
1:27:23
I like doing this and I like doing this.
1:27:25
Yada, yada.
1:27:25
They go like, that makes sense.
1:27:26
Is that how... and some of my favorite kids, you know,
1:27:29
honestly, they go like, wow.
1:27:31
Is that like how I’m a girl but I like soccer?
1:27:35
Sometimes I think I can’t play soccer but I like to.
1:27:37
I go, yes.
1:27:37
It’s exactly like that.
1:27:38
You can be anything you want to me.
1:27:39
You just talk about it and explore that in a gender way.
1:27:42
Oh, and there was something else I was going to say.
1:27:42
But,
1:27:45
yeah, no I love being an adult, an adult for kids.
1:27:49
I also just love in this little small community I make parents so mad.
1:27:54
It’s also shocking to me how many parents, like, I met them at the
1:27:58
protest that happened recently for, the pro-education protest.
1:28:02
All these parents who I have never met in my life all knew me by my first name.
1:28:07
They all knew me.
1:28:08
I was like, who are you?
1:28:09
They’re like, oh, Indigo.
1:28:10
I’m like, hey.
1:28:11
Yeah.
1:28:11
Hey what’s up?
1:28:11
How are you?
1:28:12
I don’t know who you are [laughs] . My teacher kid–my teacher kid’s friend.
1:28:16
But yeah, no.
1:28:18
I’m Dr. John Smith.
1:28:19
Doctor or parent of this kid.
1:28:22
I go, oh, great.
1:28:23
You know
1:28:28
me [laughs]
1:28:29
. [Laughs]
1:28:29
. Kids will make sure of that
1:28:33
[laughs]
1:28:34
. Then you have kids you don’t even teach whose parents know who you are.
1:28:37
That’s what I’m saying, yeah.
1:28:38
Because their friends go home and talk to their other friends
1:28:42
who talk to their parents and their parents are like, Indigo?
1:28:46
All the kids are being like, my teacher’s the coolest.
1:28:50
Honestly.
1:28:50
Apparently, I’ve heard it from parents and a few kids, I’ve started talks
1:28:54
at home about these kids, there’s a couple of fifth graders who are
1:28:58
somewhere in the queer spectrum.
1:28:59
I don’t know exactly what’s changing for them, but their mom came to me
1:29:04
at morning drop-off and was like, yeah, you know, my kid’s deciding that
1:29:07
they’re going to be a different way.
1:29:09
I was like, what are you talking about?
1:29:10
You’re being so ambiguous.
1:29:12
They were like, she’s like, some people in our family aren’t quite
1:29:16
on board, but I think that they can be how... I was like, okay, great.
1:29:21
I’m glad we had this talk, but...
1:29:23
I need to teach my class now.
1:29:25
No, apparently, I’m starting conver—sometimes.
1:29:28
I don’t want to put so much on me, but I guess I’m starting some conversations,
1:29:32
too, about gender and stuff like that.
1:29:34
Just by being there.
1:29:36
Just by existing.
1:29:37
That’s so cool.
1:29:37
What can I say?
1:29:42
Just seeing another person makes a big difference.
1:29:48
This is Quincy speaking.
1:29:50
I can think about what a difference it was when my grandpa finally
1:29:57
did come out to me and my brother and what a difference that made.
1:30:05
Also, it made me realize just how big of a deal it was to see how others responded.
1:30:12
Like, that could have been a more empowering moment if I wasn’t
1:30:19
around a bunch of cis people.
1:30:21
Yeah.
1:30:21
Who talk like cis people talk when they think they’re alone, like,
1:30:26
hearing all this stuff about like, oh
1:30:31
it’s a kind of death and grief and oh, my goodness and crying.
1:30:37
I’m like, okay.
1:30:41
Um... so, this is what this means?
1:30:45
Like?
1:30:46
No.
1:30:49
I think sometimes that can be where people get tripped up,
1:30:56
is other people’s reactions.
1:31:00
I think it took getting a fully developed brain and being an
1:31:02
adult to be like, oh Mom and Dad, that was their deal, their thing.
1:31:11
That wasn’t me.
1:31:14
I get to have my own feelings about this now, and my own relationship to what is
1:31:20
happening with my grandparent and I don’t have to pay attention to that anymore.
1:31:24
Like, what am I going to do about the fact that they’re struggling?
1:31:28
Nothing.
1:31:33
So, they hear all these kids.
1:31:40
They’re seeing an adult, which is powerful, but it seems like at least
1:31:46
some of them are getting positive reactions enough where hopefully
1:31:52
anything negative that they’re hearing
1:31:56
will be okay.
1:31:59
Also, it, yeah, parents being angry.
1:32:03
Parents are going to parent, I
1:32:07
guess.
1:32:07
It sounds like you’re handling that alright.
1:32:11
Yeah.
1:32:12
Sometimes it’s good to laugh at that.
1:32:19
Something that’s kind of a bit of a topic shift, unless other people have
1:32:24
stuff to add, I wanted, since we’ve got less than 15 minutes left, I wanted
1:32:29
to go a little deeper into this thing that when we were writing the prompt
1:32:35
we talked about a lot, kind of like specifically institutional memory, and
1:32:42
trans people within institutional memory at OSU or any other kind of institutions
1:32:50
and people’s thoughts on that, if people need a little definition of
1:32:56
institutional memory, that’s also valid, because it’s kind of not a term that
1:33:03
gets thrown around a whole lot, I think.
1:33:06
Where
1:33:09
exactly are we drawing the line between institutional memory and
1:33:13
community memory, given that so much...
1:33:14
See, that’s the thing we got to talk about.
1:33:16
So much of like, especially the queer community that’s accessible to people
1:33:21
in college at OSU is through this institution, but it’s also, there’s
1:33:27
also parts of it that are community.
1:33:29
Like, if I tell another person on Discord, like, oh, hey, you can... Fred
1:33:34
Meyer is a decent place to buy makeup if you’re still thinking about it.
1:33:37
Like, pretty much no one’s in that aisle ever, and
1:33:41
you can self-checkout so you don’t have to deal with that.
1:33:47
Is that institutional?
1:33:48
Is that not institutional?
1:33:50
I would say that specific example is definitely more community-based.
1:33:56
I guess, like, part of, oh, this is Eli talking responding to [Anonymous]
1:34:02
. Yeah,
1:34:04
sorry.
1:34:05
No.
1:34:05
It’s all good.
1:34:06
I guess part of what we need to grapple with is how do we continue to
1:34:12
try and exist and ideally thrive as a community within this institution,
1:34:20
because with your example that’s kind of like on the Pride Center Discord.
1:34:26
That
1:34:29
is technically within an OSU space, but it’s like a queer space first.
1:34:39
Yeah.
1:34:40
Yeah.
1:34:41
I guess the issue is that sometimes the institution takes issue with our
1:34:48
queerness and butt in, or like any other kind of identities that we may hold.
1:35:01
The university’s going to university, I guess.
1:35:06
So, it’s like, okay, when the institution infringes on the community
1:35:14
we’ve built within it, what do we do?
1:35:18
I don’t know.
1:35:18
These are half-formed thoughts that I have.
1:35:26
This is Bones speaking.
1:35:31
One thing I think about with institutional memory is who has access to these memories
1:35:38
and in general the public doesn’t have a lot of access to academic records
1:35:45
in general, research studies work.
1:35:50
So, how are we both educating those in the community who don’t have
1:35:58
access to these academic resources?
1:36:01
Because academic resources are often behind the barrier of
1:36:05
academia, which is financial,
1:36:10
intellectual barriers to accessing these information because in order
1:36:17
to access institutional information, you usually have to be tied to
1:36:20
the university in some capacity, whether that is as student or staff.

We are at 7:00.
1:36:34
Does anyone have final thoughts for this discussion?
1:36:49
Yes, my
1:36:53
thoughts are I’m glad that we can be in this space, have it
1:37:00
recorded, and contribute to that communal memory, institutional
1:37:10
memory [as fraught as it is].
1:37:15
It’s
1:37:18
important to be a part of memories because if you’re honest, there’s less
1:37:24
ways you can misconstrue, hopefully.
1:37:28
I still see institutions and people misconstrue what people say, even with
1:37:33
the most blatantness of intents, but as long as a record exists, we exist.
1:37:40
Uh hmm.
1:37:44
Yeah.
1:37:44
Thank you to everyone for contributing to this record of our
1:37:51
community at
1:38:13
OSU.
1:38:14
[Indistinct chatter]
1:38:16
. How do we turn it off?
1:38:18
Um, that’s what I’m... oh, is it this?
1:38:21
Probably.
