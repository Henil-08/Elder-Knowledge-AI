00:02
Okay.
00:03
Today is February 24th, 2024.
00:06
I am here with Alder Chu over zoom and we are— well, I'm in Corvallis today.
00:11
Where are you at today?
00:12
Also Corvallis.
00:14
My name is Jozie Billings and we are doing this interview as a part of
00:16
my honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary, welcome to the interview.
00:22
All right, so to start, you want to just
00:25
reiterate for the interview, how you identify and what your pronouns are?
00:30
My name is Alder.
00:31
I identify as like trans, non-binary, genderqueer.
00:35
My pronouns are he/they.
00:38
All right.
00:38
Okay, so let's just start with the beginning–your childhood, that is.
00:43
What was it like for you?
00:45
Like, were there any formative experiences for your gender?
00:47
Or, like, what activities were you involved in?
00:49
Stuff like that.
00:52
I don't know a lot about activities.
00:56
I remember a little bit about like,
01:02
I don't know about gender specific activities, but,
01:06
mostly I think of like…I
01:12
don't know.
01:13
Just, like playing as a kid and stuff.
01:17
But I don't really remember anything
01:21
from being small correlated with gender identity.
01:26
Like, I don't think I thought about that a lot, a lot as a kid.
01:29
What kind of things did you play?
01:35
A lot of
01:38
digging holes in the ground and building, like, little fairy houses and stuff.
01:45
That cute.
01:46
All right.
01:46
Well, when did you, like, start your gender exploration process then?
01:54
In sixth grade.
01:56
I think like the beginning of sixth grade, I joined the GSA at my school.
02:02
And then really quickly after that was like, oh, there's like gender options.
02:08
And I started identifying as non-binary then.
02:18
So, like, what is, what is euphoric to you in terms of your
02:21
gender and what is dysphoric?
02:22
I think, for
02:28
euphoric stuff, I think of like,
02:33
being gendered correctly by others and like looking in the mirror and
02:39
seeing myself like more masculine or androgynous, than feminine.
02:44
[Unintelligble]
02:49
All right, do
02:55
you think there were, any other significant influences on your gender?
02:59
Like maybe where you were born?
03:03
Like, what religion your family was.
03:05
Maybe a job you had.
03:06
Anything like that?
03:13
I don’t know about this specifically, but, like over middle and high school
03:19
I had some kind of like going back and forth because I was, I was kind of in the
03:24
closet at home and then out at school.
03:26
And I think that did have an influence on how I
03:33
perceive, like, being out to other people about my gender.
03:40
Yeah.
03:40
You mentioned you were in GSA at school.
03:42
Can you talk a little bit more about that?
03:47
Yeah, it was just like a bunch of queer and mostly trans
03:51
middle schoolers and… but,
03:57
we didn't really do that much.
03:58
It was mostly just like a little social group.
04:02
But I think from that I was like, able to more openly connect with queer students.
04:14
Yeah.
04:15
Yeah, okay.
04:19
So,
04:22
do you think there are any, like, role models for masculinity in your
04:26
life that you really looked up to?
04:33
Sure.
04:33
I don't think I really.
04:38
I don't think I've really thought of role models in terms of like,
04:44
modeling specific genders, I guess I don't know.
05:00
Okay.
05:00
That’s ok.
05:00
Where you, like, involved in online spaces in any way?
05:03
Or like how does social media impact you?
05:07
I've definitely been involved in online spaces, like, since middle school.
05:14
Probably, I guess, but I've.
05:18
I think since.
05:21
But in middle school I was like, as non-binary for a bit.
05:27
And then I kind of went back to being a cis-girl for a while.
05:30
And then towards the end of middle school, I started thinking of myself
05:35
as non-binary and trans again.
05:39
And I was like out in online groups as that, but in person at school
05:45
until like maybe my sophomore or junior year of high school, I was
05:50
still presenting as cis at school.
05:57
And so, I think for a while, like online groups were the only–that
06:02
was like a space I had where I could use different pronouns.
06:07
Mostly because I was around other queer people online without
06:10
it being like a big thing.
06:11
And so I could kind of explore my gender identity that way.
06:18
So those were, those spaces were mostly like positive experiences for you?
06:25
Some positive, some negative.
06:26
I think I definitely have some like,
06:34
residual stuff I'm still mostly over from then.
06:40
But like ideas of what being trans specifically has to look like from there.
06:47
And I feel like most of that I've left behind from middle and high school, but
06:53
there were still some negative effects
06:57
from… yeah.
06:57
Can you talk a little bit about, like what that was?
07:03
Like, like how they try to, like, constrain transness, I guess?
07:11
Yeah, I think there's like some prevalent ideas of specifically like…if you're
07:24
trans, it has to be defined by… I
07:31
don't know.
07:32
Like,
07:34
more about not like making trans people fit into a “cis-het and everything else”
07:43
society and like so if you're trans, your transition goal has to be just like
07:55
stereotypical cis-man or stereotypical cis-woman.
07:59
And then that's usually, also like, pretty white in terms of transition
08:09
goal and stuff, and it doesn't leave a lot of room for like, having fun with
08:15
your gender presentation or identity.
08:21
So, like that, I don’t know, that’s one of the ideas that’s kind of prevalent.
08:28
So you said you, you've moved on from there.
08:30
So, like, how do you like to have fun with your gender expression?
08:39
I feel like most of…
08:44
Initially I was trying to be masculine in a way that's just like.
08:51
Clothes that were kind of boring or masculine--boring and masculine and like,
08:59
nondescript.
09:00
And so, I think,
09:06
I have,
09:09
part of, like in college, I've been trying to wear things that are
09:12
like fun to wear and also make me feel gender euphoria and not just
09:21
feel like they're fitting into masculine constraints because,
09:24
like, I can do whatever I want.
09:28
I don't have to just be wearing, like, t-shirt and pants all the time.
09:33
What are some of those things that you wear?
09:37
I have this.
09:38
I think it's kind of fun.
09:40
I got some cool jeans that are, like, embroidered with all of these
09:44
flowers at the beginning of the year.
09:47
Just stuff like that.
09:50
Like, I think I wasn't wearing that much color in high school.
09:56
And so, it's fun to be able to do that or to feel more comfortable doing that here.
10:06
So you said you do that here.
10:08
So, like that, like happened, like after you moved out and
10:12
started going to college?
10:16
I was still.
10:21
I think I still had like.
10:26
Partway through high school I was like, kind of done with the idea that
10:30
I needed to be looking and dressing a certain way in order to, like,
10:35
be trans, but I was still kind of looking and dressing that way anyway.
10:42
And so, it was like the first week here, there were some, there were a lot of like
10:49
thrift store things and clothing swaps.
10:54
And I was like, oh, there's cool stuff here.
10:56
So, I think I've sort of started to change my presentation a
10:59
bit since getting to college.
11:02
And like, overall, how's OSU been for you?
11:09
I, I feel more.
11:16
Like my gender identity is more seen here, but I'm also specifically
11:22
on the Pride floor of the dorm.
11:25
So, like most of my friends and neighbors are trans and gender
11:30
queer and non-binary and stuff.
11:34
So, I feel like with that specifically, I feel,
11:40
a lot more seen.
11:43
And if I'm,
11:46
I still will like, get misgendered and deadnamed in class sometimes, but because
11:53
of the community I have here specifically like it, it makes that more tolerable.
12:01
I've, I didn't actually know we had a pride floor in the dorms, but,
12:05
like what's that experience like?
12:13
We like, talk to each other.
12:15
Like I know most of my neighbors on this side and the other wing of the floor.
12:19
And I get the impression that that's not normal for dorms, but I don't know.
12:25
We use the common room a lot and I don't see other floors using
12:28
their common room very often.
12:30
But it's like decorated and I… the first week of school, we had some sort of
12:37
tea party thing that like half of the floor was at, and that kind of kicked
12:44
off us socializing with each other.
12:47
So, I don't know.
12:49
I've made good friends here.
12:50
That's nice.
12:51
Would you, would you recommend it to incoming queer OSU students?
12:56
Yeah.
12:58
Nice.
12:59
Okay.
13:04
Well,
13:08
we can talk about your object now.
13:10
What did you bring today?
13:13
Yes.
13:14
Which is, it's not actually trans tape, it's off brand trans tape and it's blue.
13:21
But it's for binding, like,
13:26
for like taping your chest.
13:28
And I picked it as my object because it is,
13:35
it's like partially the,
13:39
about gender expression, like masculinizing.
13:44
But, also I have to get more of it recently, and I got the bright
13:47
blue kind instead of the beige kind because I thought it would be fun.
13:51
So, partially about the gender expression and also just having fun with it.
13:59
Why do you choose to use that over like a binder or something like that?
14:02
I
14:04
also have a couple of binders.
14:06
I kind of switch out which ones I use or like if I'm binding with a blender
14:11
with this, but my binders are beige.
14:17
So it's like, I don't know, those are less
14:21
fun in terms of color and also kind of restricting in shoulder movements.
14:29
Yeah, you keep bringing up color a lot.
14:31
I'm just kind of curious what your favorite color is.
14:36
Just colorfulness.
14:39
I don't know if I have a specific favorite color.
14:42
Interesting.
14:43
What colors are you drawn to the most?
14:50
I don't know.
14:52
I if I have to like decorate something.
14:56
I have been recently just doing stuff in pink and blue and white just
15:01
to like add elements of the trans flag to things, because that's fun.
15:08
I, there was this wizard battle thing on campus.
15:12
Yeah!
15:13
Did you go to that?
15:15
No, I didn't, but I saw the—
15:16
See the signs about it?
15:18
It was basically just a game of capture the flag.
15:20
But my friends and I did a bunch of craft stuff for wizard costumes, and I made a
15:25
wizard hat and put it in trans colors.
15:28
Because why not?
15:29
Yeah,
15:34
I saw that wizard battle—huh?
15:36
Oh, if I like, decorate things in colors, it's fun to just do it in the trans flag.
15:42
But I don't always do that.
15:47
Yeah, I saw the wizard battle stuff last year too, and I was
15:49
like, it's so creative, of like the OSU community to do that.
15:53
And they have a hobbit market in the spring too.
15:56
That’s really fun too.
15:58
I didn’t know that.
16:01
Yeah.
16:01
I think it's in May or something.
16:16
I feel like that's all the questions I had.
16:19
Do you.
16:19
Do you have anything else to add?
16:25
I don't know.
16:31
I'm just looking at the email of the questions.
16:33
[Shrugs] I don’t know if I have anything else to add.
16:33
All right.
16:33
That's okay.
16:46
Well, if
16:56
you ever think of anything else to add just let me know,
16:58
we can do another interview.
17:02
All right.
17:03
Thank you for doing this, though.
