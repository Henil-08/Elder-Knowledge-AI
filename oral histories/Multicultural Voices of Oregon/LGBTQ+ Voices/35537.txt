00:00
Okay.
00:00
Today is February 11th, 2024.
00:03
I'm here with Danny over zoom.
00:05
And I'm in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:07
Where are you today?
00:09
Corvallis, Oregon.
00:11
Okay.
00:12
My name is Jozie Billings, and we're doing this interview as a part of my
00:15
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:17
Welcome to the interview.
00:20
To get started, do you want to just, reiterate for the interview how you
00:24
identify and what your pronouns are?
00:29
I am a trans-masculine person, and my pronouns are he/they.
00:35
All right.
00:36
We're going to start at the beginning, maybe with like your childhood.
00:42
How did you act in your childhood?
00:44
What kind of activities were you involved in?
00:45
Were there any, like, formative experiences that stand out to
00:48
you in terms of your gender?
00:50
Yeah.
00:51
So I am a twin.
00:53
I grew up with a twin brother.
00:56
So when we were little kids, I didn't really see a difference
00:59
between my twin brother and myself.
01:01
Like, so I didn't really.
01:04
I didn't have any sisters or anything, so I didn't really understand, I guess,
01:10
how I was different from my brother.
01:12
So we did a lot of the same activities, growing up.
01:16
And,
01:19
yeah, I was really confused at the time, like why he could run around without a
01:23
shirt on, but I had to have a shirt on and just different things like that.
01:28
I remember he was in Boy Scouts, and I would always try to
01:32
attend his Boy Scout meetings.
01:34
Like,
01:36
I would always go to them.
01:39
And then one of the moms of one of the other kids pulled me aside and
01:42
said, this is a Boy Scouts meeting.
01:44
You can't be here.
01:47
So I had to stop going to Boy Scouts.
01:49
But
01:51
I played a lot of, like, soccer and did a lot of sports.
01:56
My mom put me in ballet, which I really hated.
01:59
I think it was really dysphoric for me, even though I didn't
02:02
know what that was at the time.
02:07
I don't know.
02:07
I always sort of struggled in some ways to relate to other girls who were my age at
02:15
the time, not other girls, but, you know,
02:20
and
02:22
I guess those were some of my formative experiences with gender.
02:30
When did you sort of start to question your gender?
02:35
I started to question my gender when I was about 14.
02:39
I was exposed to like some sort of queer narratives of gender online,
02:45
which I think is where a lot of people sort of find themselves, I guess.
02:51
So I realized at the time that I didn't really feel right or something felt sort
02:58
of off with my gender where I didn't feel, I guess I didn't really connect to
03:04
womanhood or like being a teenage girl.
03:08
It just didn't feel right to me.
03:11
So I came out as gender fluid, and in an environment that was
03:15
kind of unfriendly to that.
03:18
But,
03:21
and then I would sort of dress more masculinely on some days.
03:26
I had a binder and I guess that was my, my first sort of experiences with,
03:37
you know, non-binary-ness.
03:42
And I went on for years that way, I guess, sort of being gender fluid.
03:50
And then I started identifying as non-binary.
03:56
And when did you start identifying as trans-masc?
04:01
I guess around 17.
04:03
But then I went through a period of a few years where I sort of,
04:07
just like, shoved my gender under the bed and didn't think about it.
04:13
Sort of, was more, presenting more like a woman.
04:20
Maybe for about 4 or 5 years.
04:26
And then recently, about a couple years ago, I started presenting
04:34
more masculinely and, sort of, came out again as trans-masc.
04:44
You mentioned that your hometown or at the time you were living in the time wasn't
04:48
really welcoming of gender fluidity.
04:51
Is that kind of why you, like, repressed that gender exploration for a bit?
04:57
I think in some ways I was in an environment that was accepting because my
05:01
friends were very accepting at the time.
05:03
But in some ways, the sort of-I grew up in Orange County, California.
05:09
And it's pretty-surprisingly because you think California is
05:12
liberal-but surprisingly, Orange County is pretty Republican.
05:15
And my family, was, pretty Republican.
05:24
My dad was a Trump supporter.
05:27
And it, it just wasn't like a super welcoming environment.
05:33
I guess my mom wasn't like.
05:37
Like, she wasn't going to kick me out or anything, but she wasn't
05:42
going to respect my pronouns either.
05:43
Yeah,
05:47
like I think once the school nurse called me, "they" in front of my dad and he
05:51
went on this really long rant about how, like, the gay hivemind is like stealing
05:56
the souls of our children or something.
05:58
And it was really funny to me at the time, but it was also not funny because
06:02
he was really in my face about it.
06:04
So, it wasn't always like the most, it wasn't the most accepting, but
06:10
it wasn't like the least either.
06:12
If that makes sense?
06:14
Yeah.
06:14
It does.
06:16
So, it sounds like your parents weren't very supportive, but did you have any
06:21
other, like, role models in your life of, like, positive forms of masculinity
06:26
that you kind of like, saw as, like maybe you wanted to grow into, in a way.
06:31
Yeah.
06:32
I think other trans people, on, like, the internet who I saw or,
06:38
like, older, like I well, I followed on Instagram this older trans guy.
06:44
And then I realized he went to the same school as me.
06:48
And we're actually still friends today.
06:50
And I've sort of looked up to him as like, I like, I watched him sort of be
06:57
non-binary and then transition into a man.
07:01
And I don't know, he's sort of a role model for me of, like,
07:06
positive queer masculinity.
07:10
And what does that look like to you?
07:12
Positive queer masculinity.
07:14
Oh, man, that's a hard question.
07:16
I knew this interview was going to be full of, like, hard questions.
07:20
You can think about it for a second if you need to.
07:23
You know, I guess it's just.
07:28
Having your gender and being comfortable with it and doing sort
07:31
of whatever you want to do with it.
07:34
You know, feeling comfortable to dress the way you want to dress and be a man
07:41
however that feels good to you, I guess.
07:45
How does that differ from, like, mainstream ideas of masculinity?
07:51
You know, I guess mainstream masculinity is very like, you got to be a macho man.
07:58
You gotta, you can't cry.
08:01
You can't.
08:04
You gotta, I don't know.
08:06
It's not just aesthetics.
08:08
It's also roles, you know, like there are aesthetics.
08:12
Like you have to have, like, that triangle shape.
08:16
You have to have muscles.
08:18
But there's also like,
08:22
being the provider, being, you know, the
08:29
sort of masculine figure.
08:32
I don't know.
08:34
And it's not something I really identify with at all.
08:40
Yeah, that makes sense.
08:48
You mentioned that you, like, identified as non-binary for a bit.
08:52
Do you ever feel like, constrained by your label, or are you just okay with, like,
08:58
understanding that gender can be fluid sometimes and you're like, if it ever
09:01
changes, I'll just like, change the label.
09:05
Yeah, I guess sometimes I do feel a little constrained by it in that sometimes I have
09:12
a very confusing experience of gender.
09:14
Honestly, some days I feel like I could be a woman or I could be non-binary.
09:23
I still have a sort of fluid expression of gender, but most of the time I
09:27
feel pretty masculine and I'm really comfortable in dressing more masculinely.
09:35
And I am on testosterone, so I'm happy with my body looking more masculine.
09:41
But I still have these, sort of, experiences of wanting to
09:45
dress feminine and wear makeup.
09:47
And
09:49
some, I guess some people in the community, sort of, believe that, you
09:55
sort of can't be trans-masc or a trans man if you sort of express femininity,
10:01
but I think I express a lot of femininity.
10:05
I feel like I'm a very feminine man.
10:11
That's cool.
10:12
I would agree that some people do think that, but I yeah, you'd think
10:17
people who are open to other ideas of gender would be okay with people
10:22
doing whatever they want, but.
10:28
Okay.
10:32
So you kind of mentioned the older trans guy on Instagram
10:36
for, kind of, your role model.
10:38
Do you get, like, inspiration for your gender expression anywhere else?
10:43
Ooh.
10:44
I
10:48
don't know.
10:50
I guess.
10:52
Like,
10:55
I watched sort of like things on the internet, but also like, there's this,
11:05
there's this trans guy who's also named Danny who sort of shared his story
11:10
online about, like raising his young daughter and being like a pregnant trans
11:17
man and raising his young daughter.
11:20
And I read another memoir about a trans, man who was a parent.
11:26
And I think those sort of speak to me of like, men who are nurturing,
11:31
and I think that is important to me because I would like to have kids one
11:37
day, and I would sort of like to be,
11:41
you know, a dad, but also like someone who is nurturing and, so those are
11:49
sort of positive portrayals of trans masculinity that I really like.
11:56
That's good.
11:59
Kind of along the same vein, what is euphoric to you and
12:02
what is dysphoric to you?
12:07
I think a lot of my gender euphoria comes with, like, being surrounded
12:14
by my family and friends who affirm my gender, and sort of understand it,
12:22
and sort of the changes my body is undergoing because of testosterone
12:26
have been very euphoric for me.
12:31
Like my voice getting deeper, which is like a relatively new development
12:37
because I started T about two months ago.
12:39
So it's been really fun.
12:43
And, like, growing body hair, I know that's like a thing that a lot of trans
12:47
men sort of dread, but I think it rocks.
12:49
I think it's really cool.
12:53
And so going through those changes, but also, in the past, even when I wasn't
12:59
on testosterone sort of being accepted as a more masculine person or like
13:04
a man by my friends, and my partner,
13:09
and them using the right pronouns for me and just seeing me as a man, like
13:14
my friend, Anna, always says like, "oh, you're so masculine. I don't
13:18
know how anyone could misgender you." And that makes me feel really good.
13:25
And for dysphoria, I guess what makes me feel dysphoric is like, it's not
13:32
so bad when I'm, like, trying to pretend to be like a girl or something.
13:37
Like at work.
13:39
I just quit my job, but I was a server, and I had to sort of wear
13:45
makeup and sort of pretend to be very feminine, just because it
13:50
wasn't a super accepting environment.
13:52
But
13:55
it is more dysphoric to me to, like, try to be masculine and then have people
14:01
misgender me like, if I'm, like trying my best to, like, look like a man, I guess.
14:06
And people are calling me "she", it just makes me feel pretty sad.
14:11
Yeah.
14:16
I think also my family, who was not supportive, misgendering me, really sucks.
14:24
Like, my aunt and I went to get our nails done.
14:29
I got them in black, but, the nail tech called me "he" and then my
14:34
aunt started calling me, "she" in front of the nail tech, and then
14:37
the nail tech switched pronouns for me, and that felt really awful.
14:45
So.
14:47
Yeah.
14:48
How do you cope with situations like
14:54
that?
14:55
You know, I feel like I'm really good at suppressing my gender dysphoria.
15:02
Like, I did it for a long time, where I sort of lived life as a
15:07
woman, even though I wasn't a woman.
15:09
So I feel like it's just sort of a thing.
15:13
I don't know, I sort of shove it down and, like, try not to think about it and just,
15:17
like, grin and bear it, which I don't know is a healthy way to cope with dysphoria.
15:22
Like, I'm not telling anyone to cope with their dysphoria that way.
15:26
But that's sort of how I deal with it.
15:32
So has, you mentioned that your hometown wasn't very accepting, has
15:36
moving to Oregon changed, like how you present yourself in any way?
15:44
Not exactly like I was presenting very queer when I left Orange County and when
15:51
I came to Oregon, I didn't know anyone.
15:54
And, I sort of coped with that by seeking out, like, the attention of, like, men.
16:03
And
16:05
I met my ex-boyfriend.
16:07
And he was a straight man.
16:09
So, I was with him for, 2 or 3 years, sort of.
16:15
And I very much sort of, I mean, he knew I was non-binary, but he didn't
16:21
treat me as a non-binary person.
16:23
Like, he used she/her pronouns for me and called me his girlfriend.
16:27
And, you know, I just sort of like, let that, let that happen.
16:32
And I sort of dressed more feminine and, I mean, I came from this
16:40
very deeply lonely place of, I want to have people in my life.
16:46
But ended up being really unhealthy.
16:48
And even for years afterwards, I sort of internalized this message that in order
16:54
to be loved by men, I had to be feminine.
16:58
Which was a really unhealthy place for me to be.
17:01
But eventually I sort of overcame that and started dressing more masculine.
17:07
Just because the partner I was with, or the partner I am with, has been a
17:12
lot more accepting of my masculinity.
17:16
So, Oregon hasn't really changed my, presentation as much as, like, the
17:23
circumstances of going to college and being lonely, sort of pushed me into
17:29
a place that I was uncomfortable with.
17:33
Have you been able to find community here?
17:36
Yeah, but it took me a really long time.
17:41
I had to sort of leave that relationship, to sort of start
17:47
over and start to make friends.
17:52
And now I have, like, a good amount of queer friends, like, actually,
17:57
for my first testosterone shot, I had a gender reveal party.
18:02
And there was, like, like ten people there I think, who were,
18:07
like, loving and supportive.
18:09
And it was really fun.
18:12
Like a bunch of friends.
18:14
But then also my partner's parents, who are lesbians, came.
18:18
And it was, it was just like all queer people there, and it was really cool.
18:24
So yeah, so I sort of do have community now.
18:28
That sounds really nice.
18:30
The gender reveal party sounds really fun.
18:34
It was really fun.
18:34
I made cupcakes and they had blue frosting inside of them.
18:37
Awe.
18:38
So
18:46
this might be a little bit of a jump from the last conversation, but when
18:50
have you felt most at home in your body?
18:55
I think for a long time, like dressing feminine.
18:58
I didn't know why I was so uncomfortable with my body.
19:01
Like, I thought maybe it was the shape of my body, or, like, I don't know, the fact
19:07
that my body didn't conform to, like, a woman's body in the way I wanted it to.
19:12
But, as I have sort of stopped seeing my body as a woman's
19:17
body and started to accept it,
19:20
as my body and sort of stopped dissociating from it.
19:25
I've sort of become more comfortable with, yeah, with being in touch with my body.
19:33
And, even though my body hasn't changed that much from testosterone yet.
19:41
Seeing myself as a man has made me so much more comfortable in my body
19:45
and, like, even the shape of my body.
19:53
Okay, checking my list of questions.
19:56
Let's, I want
20:06
to ask you about your object, what object to bring today.
20:09
I brought a poem, which I'm really nervous about sharing, but, I've been writing.
20:16
I've sort of been expressing myself more since I've gone on this gender journey.
20:20
And my poem, you know, it's not, it's not like a great poem, but, I feel like
20:26
it's a good expression of my gender.
20:28
So.
20:28
Okay.
20:29
Go for it.
20:31
Okay.
20:31
It's
20:36
called a gender catalog.
20:37
And.
20:39
Okay: "First
20:40
There is a poem I wrote about clay while I was still questioning my gender,
20:44
About the ways we sculpt and shape ourselves through choice and then
20:48
There is my Old Spice Deep Sea deodorant,
20:50
But also my You perfume by Glossier,
20:53
That mingle together when I wear my Friday night best smelling
20:56
like Queer confusion and then
20:57
There is my front zip purple chest binder and my knitted packer, hand made by
21:02
unnamed angels who I send silent thank yous to every time I pass as a man to
21:06
other people's grandmothers, and then
21:08
There is my [T]estosterone and the needles that push it into my thigh,
21:11
so I can grow hair in new and exciting places, and feel my voice crack
21:14
like birdsong when I laugh and joke and yell joyous expletives and then
21:20
There is the feeling of elation when I wear my first suit jacket and cactus print
21:23
button up and brush brown mascara into the fine hairs of my upper lip that began to
21:28
grow after I started testosterone, and I feel like hot stuff going to my brother's
21:32
wedding even though I sign his marriage certificate with my deadname and then
21:36
There is my love for my fiancé and my friends and my family, because
21:40
gender cannot exist in a vacuum but is a manifestation of our relationship
21:44
to other people and society,
21:46
There is the voice in my head that tells me I will get there
21:48
one day even though I don't know where this path goes yet and then
21:52
There is the gentleness and love I radiate when I spread my hands over
21:56
and wash my very own body with soap and feel the unease I used to feel about
22:00
myself quiet as I transform and then
22:02
There is my set of brand new beginner's tarot cards that I bought with a
22:06
gift card my dead dad gave me that I prayed would tell me transitioning
22:10
was the solution to the question I couldn't even put words to and lastly
22:14
There is me learning that the answer to that question has always been me"
22:19
And, that's my poem.
22:21
That was really good.
22:22
I'm trying not to cry right now.
22:26
Goddamn.
22:27
What was your process like writing that?
22:32
I don't know.
22:33
I was, I was trying to put together sort of a list of items
22:38
that gave me gender euphoria.
22:39
I don't know, I feel like it's a very joyous poem.
22:44
And, or a sort of picture of, like, where I'm at and my gender right now in my life.
22:55
And I feel like I went sort of from concrete objects to sort
22:58
of more abstract sort of things.
23:00
But,
23:03
I just really tried to capture my standing in my own gender,
23:08
in my own life right now.
23:12
Yeah, I definitely agree, it is very joyous, they were tears of joy, but
23:18
God, I had a question about it...
23:27
Do you, do you make a lot of art like this?
23:30
Or write a lot of poems, I guess?
23:33
I've been writing more poems.
23:34
I took, a few terms ago.
23:38
I took a poetry writing class, and then I started writing more poems.
23:42
I used to write poems when I was a teenager, but they're the kind
23:44
of poems that you like bury under your bed, so no one ever sees them.
23:47
So.
23:50
But I sort of started, I don't know, I feel like when I started testosterone,
23:54
I started living as a man, I sort of, I sort of, like, stopped dissociating
23:59
from my life a little bit, and I was sort of more able to come
24:03
into, like, a more creative space.
24:07
Maybe just like, I don't know, like, I kind of hate Maslow's hierarchy of
24:11
needs, but, you know, just like having your belongingness met, sort of, allows
24:17
you to be more creative or some shit.
24:21
I don't know, can I cuss in this interview?
24:24
Other people have, so, yes, go for it if you want to.
24:27
Okay.
24:28
Yeah.
24:31
But I've sort of been able to be more creative, and that feels really good.
24:36
Do you have anything else you want to share about your poem
24:39
or your process making it?
24:40
Well, I brought a couple more objects in case that wasn't good enough.
24:44
What?
24:44
No, that was amazing!
24:46
I have my testosterone vial right here.
24:50
You can't really see it that well because it's tiny.
24:55
It's really amazing that something this tiny can create, like, such huge changes.
25:01
And then I have my hat that says Protect Trans kids, which my
25:05
partner got me for Christmas.
25:07
So,
25:09
I just wanted to be prepared with a variety of objects.
25:12
Those are good, very good objects.
25:16
I just kind of wanted to, going back to the poem a little bit,
25:22
like, I think expressions of queer joy are very important.
25:26
And I was wondering if you, like, saw any of those that
25:29
kind of inspired you in away.
25:31
Maybe not necessarily for the poem, but just like maybe for your life in general.
25:36
Yeah.
25:38
I read a lot of queer poetry online, which
25:43
makes me really happy.
25:46
And I don't know, this is really lame, but when I first started thinking about
25:52
going to it on testosterone, I watched a lot of, like, those compilations of people
25:57
being like, this is my voice one day on T. This is my voice, six months on T.
26:03
You know, just like transition timelines.
26:05
And, you know, they always look so happy.
26:08
And that really spoke to me, I guess, of, like, people undergoing
26:12
transformation, or trans-masc people undergoing transformation and, like,
26:17
loving themselves through it and loving themselves more, even if their
26:22
bodies didn't match up to society's expectations of what a man's body
26:26
should look like, they love themselves more for going through those changes
26:30
and becoming more themselves.
26:34
That really meant a lot to me, and still does.
26:37
Yeah.
26:39
Do you plan on making more poems in the future?
26:42
I mean, maybe.
26:44
You mentioned you were planning on trying to publish this one.
26:46
Are you planning on, like, doing that more?
26:50
I don't know.
26:50
I don't know if I want to get it published by, like, I don't know, I
26:53
think it'd be fun to publish it on, like.
26:56
Like a small queer, like, online
27:02
website or something.
27:05
I don't know, if I would pursue getting it, like published anywhere, like notable.
27:11
It's kind of, it kind of reads more like a slam poem, too, I think,
27:15
than like a conventional, on page poem, but I have other poems that
27:22
I think I would be interested in getting published eventually.
27:24
I think it would be really cool.
27:29
I think I don't really care about, like, sharing my poems with people.
27:33
I just think it'd be really neat to put on my resume, like "Published Poet."
27:37
It,
27:39
does poetry have anything to do with, like, your career, your major right now?
27:43
No.
27:45
I'm a psychology major, and I actually want to go to school eventually to
27:48
be a licensed clinical social worker.
27:51
So it's just a hobby, I guess.
27:54
It's a good one.
27:57
Speaking of your major, I guess, I kind of wanted to ask a little bit about, like,
28:01
your experience at OSU, like specifically
28:07
OSU.
28:10
Whether that had any influence on you in any way.
28:19
I don't know.
28:20
I think.
28:27
I, what I remember when I first got to college, something that I remember
28:31
is that I wanted to change my name in the school database, but after I
28:36
changed my name, Student Health Services told me they couldn't treat me for my
28:40
chronic health conditions because my insurance was under a different name.
28:44
So I had to keep my dead name in the school system.
28:48
And I still do have it because student health won't treat me, otherwise.
28:54
So that was something that really sucks.
28:57
And so, I still have to tell all my teachers at the beginning of term that I
29:00
want them to call me something different.
29:02
And I know that's probably not OSU's fault, but.
29:07
Yeah.
29:09
Maybe.
29:09
Maybe not.
29:10
Who knows?
29:11
Do you get your, gender affirming care through the school, too?
29:15
I don't, I get it through Planned Parenthood.
29:20
Okay.
29:23
You mentioned you took a poetry class.
29:25
Have you taken any, like, of the queer studies classes here?
29:29
I haven't, but I'm actually taking psychology of gender right now.
29:32
Oh, cool, cool.
29:33
Which has been fun and cool.
29:37
It's kind of fun and cool, but kind of.
29:39
I get to hear all of my, like, cis-classmates hot takes on gender,
29:44
which has been kind of silly.
29:48
Silly how?
29:50
I don't know, I just have people being like, oh, like, isn't gender if we have
29:56
all these societies who have the same concept of gender, isn't it like, really
30:01
valid for there to be two genders?
30:03
And the teacher was like, oh, well, actually there's cultures that
30:06
have a different number of genders.
30:09
You know, just hearing discourse about it.
30:13
But I also get to bring my hot takes to class, and share them with people.
30:18
So that's fun.
30:19
What's an example of one of those hot takes?
30:22
Well, we were talking about gender, and this guy was like, oh, well, if people can
30:27
transition to whatever gender they want.
30:29
And like.
30:33
What's wrong with, like, gendered marketing?
30:35
Like having razors for women and stuff.
30:38
If gender is this big, important thing that make people want to switch.
30:41
And
30:43
I sort of was like, okay, well, like, your gender label can sort of be like this
30:49
box, and you put all your gender shit in the box, you know, like your pronouns,
30:54
your name, like, what hormones, different things can all put those in your box.
30:59
And it only becomes an issue when other people are telling you what box you need
31:02
to have, or like what you put in your box.
31:05
So that was sort of my very simplified kindergarten level explanation of gender.
31:13
There is a class called, it's in the Queer Studies department, I
31:17
think, and it's called Queer of Color Arts and Activism, and you do
31:20
a lot of poem writing in that class.
31:22
So if you were if you were interested in taking one of those,
31:25
I would recommend that one for you.
31:27
Yeah, that would be really cool.
31:29
Okay.
31:31
Check my list one more time.
31:34
Oh, do you use social media?
31:37
I don't.
31:39
You don't.
31:40
I mean, you mentioned Instagram.
31:42
Did you used to use it and you don't use it anymore?
31:44
Yeah, I used to use Instagram a lot, but it was like a cringy,
31:48
like, it was like a cringy fan account that I want to bury forever.
31:55
I have an Instagram, but I've never really posted on it.
32:01
That fair.
32:01
So yeah, I'm not a big social media person.
32:05
That's very valid.
32:20
I don't think, I think I've asked all my questions.
32:24
So is there anything else you wanted to share that you feel
32:26
like we didn't touch on today?
32:31
I don't know.
32:32
I don't think so.
32:33
It was really nice to talk about my gender and stuff, though.
32:38
It would be cool if it was in SCARC or whatever it's called.
32:45
But yeah, I liked sharing my poem and I'm grateful for the opportunity to do this.
32:51
Yeah.
32:52
Thank you for sharing.
32:53
It's really wonderful.
32:55
Thank you.
