00:00
Today is February 10th, 2024, and I'm here with Mircalla Addams over Zoom.
00:07
And I'm in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:08
And where are you at today?
00:10
Also in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:12
Very cool.
00:13
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:16
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:19
Okay.
00:19
Welcome to the interview.
00:22
So to start, do you want to just reiterate for the interview how you
00:26
identify and what your pronouns are?
00:28
My pronouns are ze/hir.
00:31
And I, like as far as gender and sexuality, I identify as a femme lesbian.
00:38
Very cool.
00:38
Okay.
00:40
What does that mean to you?
00:42
I'm curious.
00:43
Like, to me, it has to do with, like, how gender roles are, like,
00:49
are socially constructed artifact.
00:51
And for me, like, to me, it's sort of grasping to the notion
00:56
of gender as a social role.
00:58
Like,
01:01
I'm not a woman, but I am a femme because there is, like,
01:07
because I do connect to what I've read of, like, the cult-, like it's a
01:11
way of connecting to my own cultural history as a queer person in a way,
01:16
or at least that's how I see it.
01:18
I don't know if that makes sense.
01:19
Yeah it does.
01:22
Okay.
01:24
Okay.
01:24
We're going to go even further back to the beginning.
01:28
Just to talk about your childhood for a bit.
01:31
I'm curious if you had any formative experiences in your childhood that
01:36
led you to identify this way, or, like, what kind of activities were you
01:39
involved in, kind of stuff like that?
01:43
I don't know if I can really, like, pinpoint any role models that I had, but
01:47
I do have these very distinct memories of, like, basically currently I do
01:53
really enjoy, like sort of the way I put it, the pageantry of femininity.
01:57
I love presenting femininely, even if I do not identify as a woman.
02:01
And like I can definitely looking back, I can see that part of me early on.
02:05
Like I remember getting into like fights with my mother when I was six about
02:09
wearing a coat, because if I wore a coat, you would not be able to see my dress.
02:15
This is very important.
02:16
And like, I wasn't even cold anyway.
02:18
So why was this a problem?
02:21
Like it's a whole thing, but like,
02:27
I guess while I always did enjoy presenting femininely, I also never
02:33
let it stop me from doing, like, exciting things: running around,
02:40
like kneeling in the mud, like,
02:45
gardening shit, you know?
02:49
They were both necessary to me.
02:55
Okay.
02:56
You mentioned your mother.
02:58
Did you have any role models as a kid as to what, like, femininity looked like or
03:05
like what you aspired to be, in a way.
03:10
Like, I mean, I grew up in the early 2000, and I think the notions of
03:16
femininity and what feminine beauty was was very different back then, and
03:22
I don't think I really aspired much to
03:30
it.
03:30
And here's the part where I feel, like, so annoyed as a person who, like, has
03:35
sworn off the Disney corporation, you know, like, but no, I think like, back
03:44
then, it was like there was honestly a lot of, like, identification and aspiration
03:50
with Belle from Beauty and the Beast.
03:52
Like,
03:54
she
03:58
was a brunette like me, loved to read, did adventurey things, but also had
04:04
the twirly gown happening, you know.
04:11
Sorry I just forgot to start my stopwatch.
04:14
No worries.
04:18
Okay.
04:19
That's cool.
04:19
Do you still identify with Belle?
04:22
Not so much.
04:23
Like, I don't know, it's also part of my grand, like, it's, it's part of my grand,
04:30
like, economic social statement is, as a student of media where, like, I do not
04:36
touch like anything done by the Disney corporation with a ten foot pole anymore.
04:40
And I honestly think I'm a lot happier for it.
04:44
Oh, never mind.
04:46
I remember a very good example that actually still holds up for me today.
04:50
I'm so sorry.
04:51
No, you're good.
04:51
Go ahead.
04:52
I, like, I will always like joke to my friends that's Tracy Turnblad,
04:57
from the original John Waters Hairspray, was like very formative.
05:01
That movie was like one of my very favorites growing up.
05:04
I still love it today.
05:06
Like the sense of style in it has really, definitely given me my fascination
05:12
with the aesthetic of the 60s.
05:14
Like,
05:16
there's just the scene at the end where she's, like, in this gown that's like
05:21
pale pink with cockroach print on it.
05:24
And it's like, and it feels so representative of like,
05:30
performing femininity in a way that, like, is outside of the norm still somehow.
05:40
Yeah.
05:43
Um.
05:47
Trying to think how to elaborate on that.
05:50
Absolutely, like, I can also go in on the fact that if we want to read into the
05:56
character of Tracy Turnblad, she's like a person who has her own outspoken political
06:01
beliefs and uses what privilege she has to, like, push like towards her, like what
06:06
she believes is right politically, which is also, like, feels tied to my personal
06:11
interpretation of them as like a social role of like doing well by my community.
06:19
Also, it like, it helped that I was a bit of a fat kid who got bullied for
06:23
it and, like, representation for me.
06:27
Um, so.
06:31
You mentioned gender is a social role to you.
06:36
Can you talk about that a little more?
06:39
Okay.
06:39
So.
06:43
My understanding of womanhood, or really like the only useful
06:46
definition that I really see,
06:50
is that the only people who count as women are those who really feel like
06:53
that's an applicable term for them.
06:55
And like,
06:58
and realizing that I was like, okay, great.
07:00
Yeah, no this seems to work.
07:01
But then I realized that doesn't really click with me.
07:06
And I don't know, like,
07:10
it's always easier to claim my queerness than, like, any
07:14
other aspect of my identity.
07:16
Like,
07:21
I don't know, like I...
07:26
Being single for several years on end, like, I don't know, I started basically
07:33
reading about more historical lesbian culture, like doing, like reading into
07:40
things like the Persistent Desire, or like Stone Butch Blues and like,
07:50
I do identify with the notion, of like, being a femme as like,
07:56
where it's like, it is just as much about how you care for others in your community
08:03
as it is about who and what you are,
08:07
and that really calls out to me.
08:11
Do you want to just talk about those books a little more?
08:13
I've read Stone Butch Boys, but I haven't heard of the other one.
08:17
Like The Persistent Desire is a collection of essays.
08:21
I will admit to being a little bit, what's the word?
08:24
Not.
08:25
Yeah, I was doing the pretentious thing where I drop a title that I've read
08:28
parts of, but not the whole thing.
08:30
I get that.
08:32
But basically, I believe it's called The Persistent Desire: a Butch Femme Reader.
08:36
And it has a bunch of essays from like, butches and femmes, like exploring their
08:41
like, relationships to the terms and like, their like, and how they perceive
08:46
like community relations that I think.
08:52
And the pieces that I have seen are very good.
08:53
And I do mean to read more, but then I don't read more.
08:59
Yeah I've seen, um, like a couple of femme lesbians I know have talked about how,
09:06
it's like, femininity in a way that is very different from the femininity of like
09:12
a straight woman or something like that.
09:15
Is that how you feel too?
09:18
Yeah.
09:19
Yeah I think.
09:26
I feel like it's, in the very best way possible, like,
09:32
it's more performative, like.
09:36
Like, I don't mean this as in, like, performative as in hollow.
09:39
I mean more as in, like, there's an intentionality to its construction,
09:45
at least for me, like, that I don't think I felt when I did
09:50
identify, like, differently.
09:55
Yeah, that makes sense.
09:56
Like, it's like instead of just being, like, assigned that role and
10:00
just having society tell you that's how you act, you're like claiming
10:03
it kind of as yours in a way.
10:05
And it's like intentionally what you are choosing to do.
10:07
Exactly.
10:08
That's cool.
10:09
Okay.
10:12
Okay.
10:14
Going back to your, maybe not childhood, but just like your past a little bit.
10:18
When did you start to question your gender or even your sexuality
10:22
since you say they're intertwined?
10:24
Okay, that's a whole journey.
10:27
Like it's a process of, like, I first started questioning my
10:31
sexuality around middle school.
10:35
Went through a bunch of labels, like.
10:41
This is, like, the part that's kind of embarrassing to say.
10:43
Like, identified as pan for a sec, because I thought that was more inclusive.
10:49
Which in hindsight, little me you don't know what you're talking about.
10:55
It's like still a thing in the queer community, so.
10:57
No, that's, that's valid.
10:59
Like, there's, like, vaguely, bi.
11:04
Then, I had my first girlfriend in high school, and she was a piece of shit to
11:08
me, but I, like, but, you know, like, that was still like a big turning point for me
11:13
where I recognized myself as a lesbian.
11:17
And then it's very funny, actually, the name that I have is
11:22
my legal name, but it is not the one that I was originally given.
11:26
And I changed my name.
11:30
But this actually came before I really started questioning my gender identity.
11:34
Like,
11:37
for a while.
11:38
I've pretty much always had kind of a bunch of trans friends, usually
11:43
transmasc, like in my life, you know?
11:46
So I usually go, yeah, I know.
11:48
Like we made up gender.
11:49
Good for you guys.
11:50
You know, like, but I'm fine.
11:52
I'm fine where I am.
11:57
Except when I realized maybe I wasn't, you know, like, we're, it's like, hey, wait,
12:01
you know, if, we're if, like, if this is how we look at the notion of womanhood.
12:05
I don't think that applies to me.
12:07
Where do I go now?
12:10
So...
12:14
I do identify as non-binary, but I choose to use pronouns that aren't
12:17
they/them because I kind of want to reject the way that, like, we've
12:24
kind of started to position they/them as like a third binary option, you
12:30
know, like we're like, yes, okay.
12:33
Are you man, woman, or they?
12:34
Okay.
12:36
But that still doesn't really feel what I want to get at.
12:39
Like, and so for a second I tried to use, just no pronouns, which
12:46
some people were good about.
12:48
Some people weren't.
12:48
Some people were just flagrantly confused, you know, like.
12:51
I mean, I don't know that I'm, like, getting back into the notion of, like,
12:59
looking at history and then, like.
13:02
Seeing other people who felt external to these notions really,
13:06
like, drew me to the use of ze/hir.
13:10
Like.
13:12
So.
13:14
Yeah.
13:14
Does that answer the question?
13:17
Yeah, no, it's all good information.
13:20
I mean, the questions are just to prompt you to share.
13:23
So.
13:23
Yeah.
13:26
You said something about the history of the usage of those pronouns?
13:31
I don't know, like.
13:35
Like if we look at, like, going.
13:36
Back to natural "Stone Butch Blues," looking at Leslie Fineberg, who also,
13:40
like used ze/hir and, like, I don't know.
13:45
Seeing like that sort of
13:50
external to these ideas of man and woman, you know, but still using like this term.
13:56
Like really, I think it makes me feel connected historically,
13:58
like, air quotes, like I'm doing it right, you know, the same way I
14:03
felt when like for my playwriting class, we had to write a tragedy.
14:07
So I went with something-like with adapting a Greek myth, you know, like.
14:11
I felt like, I'm doing it right, you know.
14:14
Like, it's not like it's that, like... is that a simile that
14:21
makes sense.
14:21
Right?
14:21
Yeah.
14:22
I think it does.
14:24
Yeah.
14:29
Okay.
14:31
We kind of talked about it.
14:35
So, I guess it's just kind of getting back into like the way that
14:40
you identify, what is euphoric to you and what is dysphoric to you?
14:52
I think that like.
14:54
I don't often experience dysphoria, but I know that I have in the past.
15:02
Like I used to work at the, I think, one of the student dining
15:05
halls my freshman year, and like.
15:10
You know, they made us wear the uniforms with the with this really
15:14
ugly, poorly fitting t-shirt.
15:16
And like, these black slacks that didn't really fit me well, like, rubber
15:21
nonstick shoes and, like, hair pulled up in a bun into this baseball cap.
15:25
And like, I did not feel like myself.
15:29
Like.
15:32
I don't know.
15:36
I think.
15:39
I don't know if it was just the uniformity of it or like.
15:46
The vague, like.
15:47
Masculinity of like, hair back under a hat, you know.
15:49
Like in a way that like.
15:52
But it just did not feel like me.
15:57
And like.
16:01
For things that make me feel euphoric.
16:04
I have to give props to my collection of absolutely garish hats.
16:08
Like, I have some.
16:10
Like, I'm not wearing one right now because it's like a zoom
16:12
interview, and I don't even have the hat in front of the camera.
16:15
But I have many.
16:16
Very.
16:17
Like, lacy, like, beaded things, like, on top of my head.
16:27
Big fan of the eccentricity of having prescription heart shaped glasses.
16:33
Those are prescription?
16:34
Yes they are.
16:35
That's awesome.
16:38
Like,
16:45
sort of,
16:50
corsets when I use them, especially like as a practical measure for my back pain.
16:54
Where
16:56
it feels like this crossroads between like.
17:01
Doing something that is usually considered.
17:04
Like, useless or just to be pretty, you know?
17:07
But also it's serving this purpose for my own well-being.
17:14
Sort of vintage or faux vintage dresses like, especially the ones that like fit
17:19
sort of tied up at the top and then sort of flare out into something twirly, like
17:27
walking around with a parasol.
17:29
And then I also have one of my artifacts, which actually would be a good example.
17:36
Yeah.
17:37
Go ahead.
17:38
Chose not to wear it.
17:44
[Holds up pink tank top with "BUTCH BAIT" written on the front]
17:44
Ah, lovely.
17:44
Oh, I got it from, like, queer artist on Etsy who, like, I'd been following for a
17:49
while and, like, I don't know, it got here and I just felt so pretty and so, like, me
17:58
in it, had to resist the urge to bring it on, like a family trip to like, to a beach
18:04
in California, cause I'm like, I feel like this is not the right time, sadly.
18:16
Yeah.
18:17
I love that shirt.
18:17
I've seen those shirts before.
18:18
That's awesome.
18:19
So do you like this shirt because it it, like, feels nice to wear
18:27
and like it provides you comfort?
18:29
Or do you does it help you, like, present in the way you want to?
18:33
Both.
18:34
Both.
18:34
It does look very comfy.
18:36
Yeah.
18:39
Like.
18:41
I know it's.
18:42
Been a bit of a journey getting comfortable with like baring my stomach
18:46
again, like as someone who grew up, like, if not fat, bullied for being fat, you
18:52
know, like and that's been a journey I've been on where like last summer, I
18:56
actually managed to do a bikini once, like I went to a river and it was, it was fine.
19:02
Like it was fine.
19:03
Yeah.
19:04
I would also say that like as far as like.
19:09
For, like, gender euphoria in relation to performance as a social role like.
19:16
I do feel very much myself when I'm looking after the people
19:20
I care about, you know, like.
19:25
I'm a good friend to have when you're sick.
19:28
I'm like, oh, do you need soup?
19:30
I can make soup!
19:35
You know.
19:35
I
19:39
had a thought I'm trying to
19:43
remember what it was.
19:45
So okay, so you mentioned being bullied because you're fat.
19:49
And I know it's like kind of women are expected to be
19:52
skinny, especially in the US.
19:56
Did that ever feel like restrictive to you?
19:58
Or any parts of femininity, kind of like, restricting to you?
20:04
It's actually an interesting question because like...
20:10
For a while, I was fat, like up until, like towards the end of
20:14
high school and then at the end of high school, during the pandemic.
20:19
I spontaneously lost a lot of weight.
20:21
I'm going with like, my best guess is from stress, like depression
20:25
and just fundamentally eating less because of depression.
20:28
You know, like, and for a few years I was like suddenly skinny, which
20:32
was weird, like in a way where
20:37
I felt prettier, and then I felt bad for feeling prettier because
20:40
it's like, damn, I thought I cultivated such good body neutrality.
20:43
What happened?
20:44
You know?
20:46
And I was cold all the time.
20:48
And kind of blue, you know.
20:52
But recently, this summer, I don't entirely know, Like, why?
20:58
Because it's like the human body is a mystery.
21:00
It's a process.
21:01
And I really do mean to get regular checkups and then I don't
21:03
do that, you know, like, but I did, like, gain more weight again.
21:09
And it's honestly been nice.
21:13
Like.
21:15
I don't get cold all the time like I, the only flaw is like, is
21:21
that a lot of my favorite things really don't fit me right anymore.
21:24
I'm like, that's like, that gets me with like sort of disconnect from myself.
21:28
But like, I do feel
21:32
like it feels more natural to be at this size for me, you know.
21:41
Kind of along the same vein as that, when have you felt most at home in your body?
22:00
Honestly, I think now like.
22:04
Or at least, it's the most myself I've been in this form that I
22:09
have been so far, you know, like.
22:13
Again,
22:18
like, I really do try to cultivate that neutrality.
22:20
Like my body is like,
22:24
it is like it is where I live, you know?
22:27
Like.
22:30
And I don't see a lot of use and, like,
22:36
having favorite parts of it or like least favorite parts.
22:40
This whole, like, I'm taking another acting class this term because I'm
22:45
like, I'm double majoring in theater.
22:47
And like our professor had us journal about like, what's your
22:51
favorite part of your body?
22:53
What's your least favorite part of your body?
22:54
Was it always like this?
22:55
Like it is, it's very useful, nonjudgmental, like, so we can have
22:58
that information about ourselves.
22:59
It's about movement.
23:00
Like about feeling at home in your corporeal form.
23:02
But I'm like, Andrew, it's like asking you to pick a favorite
23:07
wheel of my car, you know?
23:09
I don't know, I feel
23:17
like my body does what I want.
23:19
Like what I try to do with it.
23:21
It takes me where I need to go.
23:23
I, like, I feel more myself than I have for a long time, I think, if ever.
23:34
That's nice.
23:35
You
23:37
mentioned theater.
23:38
Did you- how long have you done theater for?
23:41
On and off for forever.
23:46
Like, always.
23:49
Like always very much loved it when I was little.
23:52
Like, I love the attention.
23:54
I'm good at memorizing-Hello.
23:56
You are not allowed on the table, you idiot.
23:59
[Picks up a cat off of the table] You are not allowed on the table.
24:03
No, your paws are stinky.
24:05
They don't go on the kitchen table.
24:08
Excuse me.
24:08
No, you're good.
24:10
I can't control my cat either.
24:12
Yeah, no.
24:13
He knows better.
24:14
He knows he's not supposed to be on the kitchen surfaces and yet.
24:19
Okay, so I don't know, since I was really little.
24:25
I did a couple years in high school, like basically it was all like from a young age
24:30
up until, like, the end of middle school.
24:33
And then I went to high school and had like all of my love for it, like
24:38
all my dreams, loves crushed by like the asshole director we had, you know,
24:42
who was very preferential, you know, like, if you were not one of the four
24:47
people out of each class, that he liked, you were kind of shit out of luck.
24:53
And so, like, that definitely got to me, like on a major level.
25:01
And then, I think I kind of just let that be for a, like, a while.
25:08
Until my sophomore year of college, when my best friend, like he, by
25:14
sheer coincidence, like moved to my hometown when I was studying remotely
25:19
there or like, no, he was, he moved to my hometown my senior year of
25:24
high school during the pandemic.
25:26
Like, we had met online and like, now, like, he's actually one of the people that
25:32
I met through "The Danger Days" album.
25:34
That's neither here nor there, like.
25:37
But basically, he, by sheer freak accident, moved to my hometown.
25:41
So, like we spent that summer like, hanging out and like we moved in
25:46
together my sophomore year and I dragged him back to college at OSU after
25:51
his year of hell working at Safeway.
25:55
And like, the thing is, he went to like a theater school, like,
26:00
for his first year of college.
26:01
Like he went to, like, a very nice theater school.
26:06
And like, so he jumped into the theater program here and through
26:13
a long campaign of psychological warfare, dragged me with him.
26:18
Like it's a long, drawn out battle to get me to pick up a theater
26:21
minor because, like, you're already taking these classes with me and,
26:24
like doing these things, you know?
26:28
And then, like earlier this term, I met with my advisors and came to the
26:34
realization that you could also double major with one more term of school,
26:42
so.
26:42
So you decided to do it?
26:43
Yeah.
26:44
I'm like, I don't know.
26:46
I'm still not a person who, really gets cast in things like, and that
26:54
definitely gets to me in the self-esteem.
26:56
But like, it's all a process I know.
26:59
Like,
27:03
and a part of me worries on some level that it like,
27:08
has to do with my gender.
27:12
Where, like, I wonder if people are confused because I do
27:16
openly use ze/hir pronouns.
27:18
And like,
27:21
you will, like, I will see teachers who are wonderful people who I get along with,
27:24
who like I have a lot of respect for, but they like just kind of, like, awkwardly
27:29
talk around me if they need to refer to me in class or like stuff like that, or like.
27:38
I get this sense that they don't really understand what's going on
27:40
and are too scared to ask and don't really know what to do with me.
27:44
Like.
27:47
But, you know, like I have involvement in other ways.
27:51
I wrote for the One Act festival last year.
27:53
I'm writing for the One Act Festival this year, and my honors
27:58
thesis is actually going to be a full length play next winter.
28:01
Like.
28:03
I'm thinking of doing something based off of, like, off of the unfinished epic poem
28:09
Christabel, by, like, Coleridge, which is cited as one of the, frequently cited as
28:15
a source for, like the novella Carmilla, from which I stole my first name, I think.
28:20
That's cool.
28:21
Yeah.
28:22
Yeah, like.
28:25
So most of my life, in some way.
28:26
But I think only for the last few years that I've been, like,
28:32
serious about it, in a way.
28:36
I'm wondering if that influenced your gender in any way.
28:41
Only because you talked about, like, the intentionality of, like,
28:44
choosing femininity for yourself.
28:46
It's like also something about like putting on a role and like-.
28:50
Yeah, no, like I that is.
28:52
I think that is, it has to do with why I articulate gender
28:56
in the context of performance.
28:57
You know, like.
29:00
Like I would argue that, you know, like on some level, like most use of
29:05
gender is, you know, like where we have these agreed upon, like social roles
29:12
and like, and functions, you know, there's like if you want to get very
29:18
stereotypical, go back to the 50s, like there's lines to it like that "Hi,
29:22
honey. How was your day?" of it all.
29:23
You know, like I think that they're definitely, I definitely classify
29:28
my gender in a performative aspect, you know, like.
29:34
Like.
29:40
Okay, honestly, a lot of my favorite articles of clothing are, like,
29:44
old costume jewelry or stuff that I bought from, like the costume
29:48
sale that I run as...I'm also the president of the theater club.
29:52
I,
29:55
everything's happening, but, you know, like.
30:03
So.
30:03
Yeah.
30:03
Like.
30:05
Yeah, definitely.
30:06
Like I. Definitely.
30:10
I don't know if, like.
30:13
I don't know if my history with theater impacted, like,
30:21
how, like, impacted my gender, but it does impact how I articulate it, I think.
30:28
Have you ever read anything by Judith Butler?
30:32
Yes.
30:33
A few of her essays like.
30:35
No, I also like I also did some reading on similar notions of proto-feminism last
30:40
term for like just doing a presentation that had to do with Oscar Wilde and his
30:45
relationship to proto feminism, because we still like it's been many years and
30:49
we still haven't decided whether Oscar Wilde was a feminist or misogynist.
30:53
Like.
30:54
What is proto-feminism?
30:57
Basically, it's like sort of pre-feminist movements that were happening in the
31:01
UK before we like really see first wave, second wave, like actual like,
31:06
like, what we class as feminism.
31:07
Like they had a lot of interesting ideas and goals.
31:11
Some of them were kind of, like, they recognize genuine injustices in society
31:17
about like how women were held to higher ethical standards, like social
31:21
standards than men in this era of England.
31:24
But their solution was just to say that everyone should be held to these punitive
31:28
ethical standards and like, like they were, they were on the ball about some
31:33
things, but like how, like we kind of like, construct, like gender and we
31:38
could reconstruct it if we chose to.
31:40
But they were also really off base about what to do with the
31:43
information they had figured out.
31:48
Interesting.
31:48
And funny enough, one of the really prominent figures was a Josephine Butler,
31:54
which always tripped me out when I was reading because I was like, wait, nope.
31:57
Different one.
31:58
Different one.
31:58
Similar ideas, different one.
32:03
Such a process to read.
32:06
Okay, I'm gonna circle back a little bit because I, wrote down something
32:12
that I wanted to ask you about.
32:13
So, you mentioned you met your best friend online.
32:16
Yeah.
32:17
Right.
32:18
Was that in like.
32:19
I guess it doesn't really matter.
32:22
How, were you involved in any, like, queer spaces online?
32:31
I was interacting with a fandom space that attract, like, that
32:36
attracted really queer people.
32:37
Like I'm like.
32:40
So basically, I met a lot of the most important people in my life
32:45
who I still keep in touch with, like around the world, online.
32:49
I met them on this, like, roleplay server, like for, role playing original
32:59
characters within the universe of the concept album "Danger Days," like by
33:06
My Chemical Romance and like, I think that a lot of the themes of that album
33:15
attracts like people who are like, if you're really into it, there's honestly
33:20
a high chance that you're queer, that you feel very alienated, that you feel
33:23
very like...out of control of your life.
33:28
As if like, as if you were,
33:34
like sort of controlled by, if you were, like, limited by circumstances
33:38
outside of your control, like.
33:43
And yeah, that attracted a lot of queer people with, like,
33:49
and everyone else at the time did identify as trans.
33:54
I was the only cis person for a sec.
33:59
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
34:03
Because Gerard Way, right, is the head.
34:06
I've seen some pictures of him and like, I don't know, very feminine clothing.
34:10
In a nurse outfit.
34:11
Exactly, exactly.
34:13
Yeah.
34:13
Like that is like.
34:16
That is a non-binary musician like, queer artist right there.
34:22
Like.
34:23
Yeah.
34:24
Like so like you already have a lot of queer people if you're looking at
34:28
like My Chemical Romance enjoyers, but if you're looking at people who are
34:32
just really obsessed with Danger Days.
34:35
That is like, that's like such a subset, you know.
34:40
Yeah, I don't really listen to them much, but I definitely know a lot of
34:44
people that do and are very queer.
34:49
Kind of, around the same area of online queer spaces.
34:53
Do you use social media at all?
34:57
I use Tumblr.
34:59
I also use Tumblr.
35:00
Like, and that is like.
35:03
That is my like, connection to like not just queer community, but like
35:10
butch femme community in particular.
35:12
Like,
35:15
I have my own little, side blog like, but, air quotes, a "Not Safe For Tumblr"
35:22
one, you know, because Tumblr has had very weird decisions about adult content
35:28
over the years, and it's who knows what it even is anymore, you know, like.
35:33
But like, that's.
35:37
Like.
35:38
What can I say?
35:38
I'm a civilized internet native.
35:40
I don't, I'm not horny on main, you know.
35:45
Speaking of, do you think being involved in those communities
35:50
impacted your gender in any way, especially because you were like-
35:53
Yeah, but because it like, helped me see other people with similar experiences to
35:57
me, like who are who articulated their gender within like the terms of fem, even
36:03
if they were like more cis, you know.
36:06
Like we're like.
36:10
An examination of.
36:11
Like.
36:12
The use of butch and feminist social roles, in addition to like
36:16
descriptors that like, really spoke to me in my experiences.
36:21
Did you just kind of stumble upon those spaces one day, or did you
36:24
like, seek them out when you're like, I feel like this applies to me.
36:30
It was just an indirect thing that happened.
36:31
You know, like I follow like I follow a bunch of other queer people.
36:34
Like, I see a few interesting posts, you know, that get it at like.
36:41
These like, they're talking about like the unique experience of like,
36:45
butches in relation to gender.
36:46
I'm like, that's interesting.
36:47
Like I follow a few more people who are talking about that.
36:49
They're like, they're also talking about.
36:52
Like.
36:53
Like they're also reblogging stuff from femmes.
36:55
Like it's like it's cyclical.
36:57
It's just like slow absorption into, like, into a space, you know.
37:03
Yeah.
37:04
That definitely happens on Tumblr.
37:06
Yeah.
37:07
Like it's a process like this aside the search functions are so broken
37:12
I don't think it's possible to effectively seek things out there.
37:15
They're terrible.
37:15
It's so bad.
37:18
All right, so.
37:20
Social media, queer spaces probably had a pretty significant influence.
37:24
Did anything else have an influence?
37:26
I don't know if you're religious, but if your religion did, like a
37:28
job you had, where you were- where you grew up or anything like that?
37:37
Like I wasn't raised in any particular religion, like both of
37:41
my parents were, and they hated it.
37:44
And like.
37:45
They kind of just threw their hands up like and said, like,
37:52
you see, ze will figure it out, you know?
37:53
Like,
37:55
just give me a lot of room to experiment myself, but like, never
38:00
really went into their own beliefs.
38:01
So like, I'm like,
38:05
I'm agnostic, like, poly- like, but colored by my experiences as, like
38:12
as a middle school Wiccan, you know.
38:13
Like.
38:14
Like like, yeah, there might be Gods, but if there are they're dicks.
38:18
You know, like.
38:20
So I don't I don't really think it did a lot for my conception of gender.
38:24
Like.
38:26
Besides giving me enough, like,
38:31
enough fore-knowledge to kind of dismiss anything like that goes on about
38:35
like the divine feminine, you know.
38:38
Like.
38:41
I.
38:44
I don't know, I think really like a big social experience growing up
38:47
for me that was like formative in some way, I don't know if I could
38:51
articulate the impact it had on my gender but, Rocky Horror Live Shows.
38:57
Like, but my home town Eugene had, I don't know if they still have
39:01
after the pandemic, but they had at least a consistent shadow cast
39:06
that did like three shows a year.
39:10
3 or 4, honestly, but usually three like Halloween, Valentine's Day and Pride.
39:15
And like.
39:17
I would try to go to every one.
39:20
Like.
39:22
It was a really wonderful place to blow off steam.
39:27
Be among people where I felt understood.
39:30
Like.
39:32
Like the way I was, always like, the way I articulated it, after having gone
39:37
to one high school football game to support my friend and marching band,
39:40
it's like, oh, this is what straight people do instead of going to Rocky.
39:46
You know, like,
39:49
the societally acceptable place to scream and throw things and like
39:58
be profane and, you know, like.
40:01
Do you want to just, like, talk about what Rocky Horror is?
40:05
Because, I've seen it before, but for people who haven't.
40:06
Oh, yeah.
40:07
No.
40:07
Absolutely.
40:08
So Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cult classic film adaptation
40:15
of a stage musical that.
40:19
It has Tim Curry.
40:22
It's a point of contention for a lot of queer people.
40:24
Now, on whether or not it is good representation, which I would
40:29
argue in some respects it isn't.
40:32
But also, it's not exactly trying to be, like.
40:35
I think that its value comes not from like its value as a piece of representation,
40:40
but more for the culture surrounding.
40:41
It, like.
40:43
Where there would be midnight showings.
40:45
Like.
40:46
With audience call and response that like, reshapes the way
40:50
that the film is experienced.
40:53
Am I missing anything, do you think?
40:55
No.
40:55
And I think that explanation about, like, whether it's good representation, I don't
41:02
think it was trying to be either, but I think it's kind of sort of like the
41:04
word queer, like it was like claimed.
41:06
It's like, I know this was probably made to make fun of us in some
41:09
way, but like, we're going to take it as our own and we're going
41:11
to build that culture around it.
41:14
Yeah.
41:14
Like Richard O'Brien, like is a person who, like, has been outspoken
41:20
about having, like their own explorations of gender, but also
41:23
has come out the other end with some weird opinions about trans women.
41:28
Like, and it kind of shows in his work.
41:31
Of course.
41:39
You'll pardon me?
41:39
I need to, I need to get some water for myself.
41:41
Okay.
41:41
I kind of like, my throat is getting to me.
41:42
Excuse me.
41:42
No.
41:42
Go ahead!
41:44
Go ahead, I gotta look over my questions anyway, see if I missed anything.
41:58
And I did remember another, like, reasonable influence, like.
42:09
Like I'm autistic.
42:12
No, this is not been like diagnosed by a professional, but like, through, like,
42:18
looking like I have a very high RAADS-R Test score, like, I. It is a useful, like,
42:27
even if it is not like diagnostically confirmed, it is a useful term for
42:30
articulating myself, you know, and
42:38
I think it also comes with this degree of alienation.
42:41
Of like, needing to understand why, like about certain rules like.
42:52
And I know that there is a high prevalence of like gender nonconformity
42:55
and transgenderism within, like, like, within, like, statistically,
43:00
within like for autistic people and, like, who am I to buck the trend?
43:13
Okay.
43:14
You mentioned you had, you said artifacts when you brought out the shirt.
43:17
Did you have any more to share?
43:18
Yeah.
43:20
I've got a nice, like, French rolling pin.
43:24
Amazing.
43:27
And what about what made you choose that?
43:31
The way it feels when I hold.
43:32
It like I love to bake, I like I have.
43:37
This wonderful pie cookbook that I bought at like the antique mall that I lost
43:42
in a move that torments me every day.
43:44
I miss it, you know?
43:46
But like, I don't know, I,
43:51
like, using it.
43:54
I've been able to, like, make things that bring comfort to the people around
43:59
me, like I. Like, again, circling back to my best friend who I met
44:04
online, who I lived with for a couple of years before he moved to Alaska.
44:10
It's all the same.
44:11
I'm following up there as soon as I finish out here.
44:14
But, like, I don't know, like.
44:19
Like, I one of the primary uses of this, like, was to make,
44:24
like I made a set of like.
44:27
like he's from the south originally, and like, I made him like this set of
44:30
chest hearts, which was like a thing that he didn't even totally know exists.
44:33
But it was like a thing.
44:34
And it was like, interesting.
44:35
Like, I don't know, it's.
44:40
It's the way that it makes the place I am feel more like home for the people around
44:45
me and for myself, but also holding it.
44:48
It feels like a weapon, like I could hit someone with this, you know, like.
44:54
And I think that there's that utility that like association with
44:58
stereotypically feminine thing, like.
45:03
That space for it, like it's used as a tool to like, care for the people
45:10
around me that really, like, makes it feel connected to my gender.
45:19
You mentioned stereotypical feminine things.
45:23
I feel like most people try and lean away from stereotypes, but do
45:26
you feel like do you like to kind of, like, accept those in a way?
45:34
I like to play with them, you know.
45:36
I enjoy what I do enjoy.
45:37
Like, I've always had a great affection permitting and baking, you know, like
45:44
I am that person, but also like I used to play roller derby and like,
45:54
and I believe in like, and I try to fix my own car even if I suck at it.
45:58
You know, like.
45:58
And I don't know, like.
46:04
Like, I
46:07
try to let myself be open to enjoy, like what makes me happy.
46:11
Even if it does, like, fall within, like stereotypical bounds.
46:14
Yeah,
46:16
that's very valid.
46:18
You mentioned roller derby.
46:19
I, yeah.
46:20
Do you want- can you talk more about that?
46:22
Yes I can.
46:24
From the ages of 10 to 17, I played junior roller derby in my hometown.
46:29
For a few years, I was, co-captain of the team when I was, like, older, and, I
46:35
haven't really done anything with it for, like, a long time, I, since the pandemic.
46:40
I mean to reach back out and then I don't.
46:45
But yes, like.
46:53
I'm like.
46:54
I think, one of the first, like, crushes I had as a queer person that I was aware
47:02
of, was on one of my fellow skaters.
47:05
And like, she did not like me back.
47:07
And it was what it was, you know.
47:09
Like.
47:10
But also, one of the first people that I like came out
47:13
to was my roller derby coach.
47:17
And like.
47:19
She was very.
47:21
It's the word like.
47:23
Nonchalant about it at the time, which was helpful in its own way, like, like.
47:27
And she mentioned being grateful that I trusted her with it.
47:29
And then, like, we were Facebook friends for a while, I don't know, I ditched
47:33
Facebook after whole thing, you know?
47:35
But fundamentally, like, I don't know, there would be times when I was older
47:40
when I would see her post with like,
47:44
her girlfriend's on there and I'm like, oh,
47:47
wow, I didn't know.
47:49
Like was just like, again, it's like it's one of those sports like rugby, which
47:56
my mother played when I was growing up.
47:59
But like, that I think on some level attracts queerness.
48:03
And like it definitely gave me more space for community there.
48:06
Yeah.
48:07
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
48:08
I, I don't know anybody that plays roller derby and I've never actually been to a
48:13
match, but it just seems like the type of thing that would attract queer people.
48:17
It's true.
48:19
Also softball, I know, I played softball, there was a lot of queer people there.
48:26
Rugby is like a hotbed.
48:30
Like it's a shame that I'm not much of one for running, like.
48:34
Or like projectile sports.
48:38
Always afraid it'll hit me in the face, like.
48:45
Okay.
48:46
Oh, you mentioned it coming out.
48:48
I was I wanted to ask about your coming out process and what that was like,
48:51
whether you ever really came out or just kind of, like, started, you know, acting
48:57
as yourself, and you're just like...
48:59
Like, I mean.
49:03
Like,
49:06
I think that there's many great quotes that I cannot recite off the top of my
49:09
head about, like, how it's very much like a process thing where there's, there's
49:14
no time that you can effectively just say "hi, like, I'm a queer person I use
49:20
x, y, z, blah, blah, blah," you know, and then everyone will know forever.
49:24
Not to mention the fluidity of identity and how, like exploring
49:27
different identities, like, necessitates, in some like, to some
49:31
extent like, multiple coming outs.
49:34
Fundament-like.
49:43
I don't know.
49:44
Like.
49:49
I was always comfortable with my sexuality, like coming out with my family.
49:52
I knew that they'd be cool, you know?
49:55
But gender was the weirder one because first of all, like
50:05
my family did not react well to the name change.
50:10
Which pre-dated my gender like exploration and,
50:20
like,
50:22
clearly both my parents were insecure in different ways about it,
50:29
even though like it had long been understood that my birth
50:34
name never really fit right.
50:36
Like, I when I was very little, like I used to like
50:41
try different names every day.
50:42
Which my kindergarten teachers were not a fan of, you know,
50:47
like my mom along with, like.
50:49
She always knew that it didn't quite fit.
50:51
But you know, we needed something to call you, like.
50:55
But after a few years, they have come around on that front.
51:00
Oh, actually, circling back, it is funny.
51:03
I had, like, I had, like, zeroed in on the name, Mircalla
51:07
Adams, Like, in high school.
51:09
I knew what I wanted to do.
51:11
I was preparing for it my freshman year, like of a college, but, I
51:17
took a class called "vampires: race, gender and sexuality," like,
51:26
it's an honors colloquia.
51:26
I, like my first term and I realized, oh, wait, Carmilla is on the reading list.
51:32
Nope.
51:33
Abort.
51:33
We can't do this thing.
51:34
They will know where it is from.
51:36
We cannot do this.
51:41
Is that name in the book?
51:43
Yes.
51:43
Like, actually, yeah.
51:44
Like, because like.
51:47
The whole like one of the plot points is that like Carmilla repeatedly
51:50
uses, like, anagrams for her name.
51:53
You know?
51:53
Oh right, right.
51:54
Like, she originally was.
51:56
Countess Mircalla Carnstein, like, and
52:02
I don't know.
52:03
That was cool.
52:04
I, I've read it, and I just, like, you know, didn't remember, but.
52:07
Yeah, I do remember the anagram thing.
52:10
55:50
52:14
Lehane is also from my gay awakening of Faith Lehane
52:18
from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
52:21
So your name is very vampire based?
52:24
A little bit, yeah, yeah.
52:26
Maybe not intentionally, but it's just ended up that way.
52:28
Yeah.
52:29
Like I consider myself a scholar of vampires.
52:33
I like I have a pilot in my back pocket that I like to describe
52:38
as if it's like if "First Kill" understood what a metaphor is.
52:43
"First Kill," like the Netflix show?
52:46
Yeah.
52:47
The one that was like.
52:52
It wasn't good.
52:53
Wasn't good like I genuinely believe.
52:56
But like it did get better towards the end.
53:00
It was.
53:00
It had room to be something fun, like kind of fun and hokey in the
53:04
way that like a lot of old 90s shows are, but it just didn't have the
53:08
room to keep making it, kind of.
53:12
Like and also had a really bad start.
53:15
Like the people fell off.
53:17
I, I know I. I'm not one of the people who's like clamoring to have it renewed.
53:22
I don't hold out hope for that.
53:24
I don't think it was, I think it got canceled.
53:26
Oh yeah it did.
53:27
It got very canceled.
53:29
But I've seen people like try to do, like the.
53:32
No, guys, if we just all rewatch it this week, it'll show Netflix,
53:36
that it needs to be renewed.
53:38
No, no.
53:41
That's not going to happen.
53:43
You mentioned your major.
53:45
One of your majors is new media communications.
53:48
Yeah, what is that?
53:49
I'm curious.
53:55
It's kind of like the study of.
53:57
How human beings communicate
54:01
in the modern, like, over history, and then in the modern era, with
54:05
emergent forms of media, like, how the internet has affected human
54:09
communication and stuff like that.
54:12
I'm getting the BFA, which has more of a focus on production.
54:16
So I have more focus on, like, how to make things in emerging medias, how to
54:21
make things in traditional medias, like they make us go through like studio
54:25
art classes and, like, the way I like to think of it as it's like learning a
54:31
little bit of everything so that I know that I'm capable of learning anything.
54:37
Like last term, we did like I had to take a class on 3D modeling in
54:45
Maya, which I hated every second of, but I made it through, like.
54:50
And I was able to export something I made into unity and got to like, walk
54:55
around in this like little gazebo I made.
54:58
It was pretty cool.
55:00
It's
55:05
like.
55:07
I've always had an interest in sort of media analysis, like
55:12
symbolism, themes, motifs.
55:15
Like, how,
55:20
like what, like how what we make represents what we believe.
55:26
Like, for my high school, I was in like I was an IB person.
55:31
I did not take an IB, any of the IB tests, but they still made me write the
55:35
extended essay, which was like a mini thesis, and I wrote mine basically on how
55:42
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Homestuck" represented like the same idea of growing
55:47
up using the metaphor of super powers, but in ways that were representative of like
55:52
how we perceive the idea of growing up with the times that they were made, like.
55:58
Stuff like that, which drew me to new media, I've never really thought
56:01
of myself as much of an artist.
56:03
Like, even though I've, I think it's always being surrounded by people who
56:08
who did and were very good and like, I never felt quite like them, you know.
56:15
But I do now.
56:18
Or at least I'll call myself one now, or I'll sort of self-flagellatingly
56:25
call myself one where I go, "I feel like such an asshole when I say this,
56:29
but I'm an artist." You know, like.
56:35
Yeah, yeah.
56:36
I think it's just learning how to make things like screenplays, 3D
56:43
models, video games, all sorts of
56:50
stuff.
56:50
You mentioned Homestuck.
56:51
I'm curious if you've read the Locked Tomb series.
56:55
Yup!
56:55
Yup.
56:57
I'm-yup.
56:58
Yeah, yeah, I just.
56:59
Yeah, cause I know that Tamsyn Muir used a lot of Homestuck references in that.
57:03
But I've never, like, I don't know what you call, interacting with Homestuck.
57:08
So, here's the thing.
57:10
It's actually not very textually referential like.
57:15
But it is like, it doesn't make references to quotes or things like that.
57:23
But structurally, you can see a lot of similarities and you can see like
57:28
where, when, Tamsyn Muir, as an author who used to write Homestuck fanfiction
57:35
might have like come up with like, might have sourced some ideas, you
57:39
know, like parallels between Ianthe and Vriska are common and completely earned.
57:45
Like.
57:48
And then the notion of, like the bubbles in the River is very, very,
57:52
very similar to like the notion of dream bubbles where dead people are talking
57:56
in Homestuck, like there's a like.
57:57
Yeah.
57:58
Like
58:01
it is a very formative media for me.
58:04
Like like, here's the thing, reading all of
58:10
Homestuck leaves, like, brain damage.
58:14
Like a special kind of brain damage.
58:16
The same like, it's a similar kind to the kind of brain damage
58:21
you get after watching all of "Supernatural," which I have also done.
58:24
Don't do that, it's a bad decision.
58:26
Like where it's you will never be the same again after it.
58:33
Okay, I guess I won't read Homestuck then.
58:38
Honestly, it's, there's worse things to have rot your brain in middle school.
58:43
Like.
58:44
Sure, there are worse.
58:45
There are worse things.
58:46
Look, it's a very interesting text.
58:49
Like it's been a while since I've read it myself, but, you know,
58:53
like, it still sticks with me, like.
58:57
So it seems like you interact with a lot of media, both in like your
59:01
major and just like in general.
59:03
I'm curious if you do have like any queer media that you think is like good or, like
59:10
not that it can be perfect, but that is like maybe your favorite one or whatever.
59:17
Like, I have a great affection for the Locked Tomb series.
59:21
I see an uncomfortable amount of myself in Harrowhark Nonagesimus.
59:26
But that's neither here nor there and no kind of red flag about me.
59:33
I, like I mentioned earlier.
59:38
Like.
59:42
Oh, yes.
59:43
Actually, no.
59:44
Like, I was going to talk about "Hairspray" more, but I've actually been
59:47
reading a lot of Clive Barker lately, and he's a, he's a British writer.
59:55
Like, was kind of bigger in the 90s.
1:00:00
But he wrote a lot of short stories and some books and some plays and wrote and
1:00:06
directed adaptations of some of them.
1:00:07
And like, the really thing, the things he's really famous for would be
1:00:12
"Hellraiser." Like, where he wrote the original story that was based off of.
1:00:17
But at some point this summer, I watched his movie "Nightbreed,"
1:00:23
which is an adaptation of his novella "Cabal," and like,
1:00:29
you could tell that it was made by a gay man.
1:00:33
Like the queerest, heterosexual romance I've ever seen and it was fascinating.
1:00:39
Like, like, it's a whole story about, like, personal, like about, like,
1:00:46
being cast as a monster and being alienated and attacked and, for it.
1:00:50
And like, being unable to trust, like, medical, like
1:00:55
professionals and law enforcement.
1:00:57
And I'm like, yeah, I see that.
1:01:02
Or like reading some of his, like, stories, like there's this.
1:01:09
Like there's.
1:01:12
They're weird in a way that queer art isn't really allowed to be anymore.
1:01:18
Like the way that we kind of like, as like,
1:01:24
as a world very dominated by like our relationship with advertisers.
1:01:29
And like.
1:01:30
How we articulate morality that has this fixation on assimilation and,
1:01:34
like, "being the right kind of queer" like, I think it's really stifled a
1:01:39
lot of queer art, in like, the recent years, like, where there's this focus on
1:01:45
being palatable and reading these short stories from the Books of Blood, it's,
1:01:53
they're, they're, that insecurity is not there yet, like there is already this
1:01:58
knowledge of like, not being acceptable.
1:02:04
So it gets just, so it creates these things that are weird and interesting
1:02:10
and kind of problematic, but in a, in a way that is interesting to me.
1:02:13
You know, like.
1:02:13
I don't know, like.
1:02:13
It's
1:02:20
like such a crapshoot between like.
1:02:22
Oh, this is, this is kind of sweet actually.
1:02:24
Like this is a story about like alienation.
1:02:26
And then, wow, that is some of the weirdest, like, that is a
1:02:32
weird offhand reference to sex.
1:02:34
Okay, man.
1:02:35
Sure.
1:02:36
Okay.
1:02:37
If that's what you're into.
1:02:39
Cheers to you, buddy, you know, like, I think, I think that,
1:02:44
like, going forward, we need to be more comfortable with discomfort.
1:02:47
And we're not good at it lately.
1:02:51
You know, great love of Clive Barker.
1:02:56
Yeah, but there was something I thought of, and then I lost.
1:02:58
It happens.
1:03:02
No, I so agree about, like, palatability of queerness.
1:03:08
It's like such a thing, which doesn't make sense because in and of itself, like the
1:03:12
name, it's like it's not supposed to be.
1:03:16
But some people got it in their head that if they try to conform
1:03:20
enough, then they'll be accepted.
1:03:22
What's the word for that, there's a word for it.
1:03:25
Assimilate.
1:03:28
Respectability politics.
1:03:29
Yes.
1:03:30
That's what I'm almost thinking, like homo-nationalism, in a way.
1:03:32
But that's not.
1:03:33
Yeah.
1:03:34
No, I know what you mean.
1:03:36
Yeah.
1:03:37
Definitely interesting.
1:03:41
Yeah, I'm- new media communications.
1:03:45
Do you work in, like, advertising and stuff?
1:03:50
The thing is, it's a very flexible major.
1:03:53
I could work in advertising if I wanted.
1:03:56
To, which I could, like, I might like because, you know, God knows that,
1:04:03
like, when I move in, like with my best friend and hopefully, like, once
1:04:09
we move the rest of the people from the server out because there's like
1:04:11
three others who live across America.
1:04:13
And then one of is in Scotland, you know, someone's going
1:04:17
to need to be making money.
1:04:19
I'm like,
1:04:22
if that has to be me.
1:04:24
Like, I'll do it.
1:04:25
You know.
1:04:26
You'll be the breadwinner of the household.
1:04:27
Exactly.
1:04:30
I was just kind of wondering because,
1:04:34
like, you're talking about being, like, normal enough for people.
1:04:40
And also, you talked about how in the theater, you think your pronouns kind
1:04:45
of like, maybe put the directors off of, like, casting yourself like that.
1:04:50
And I was wondering that, like, correlated at all with your
1:04:52
major, maybe your future career.
1:04:56
Not, I don't know, like.
1:05:00
I,
1:05:04
I enjoy writing, I like, I guess ultimately, like the eventual
1:05:11
goal is to make weird queer art with what I learn, you know, like.
1:05:16
I enjoy abstract painting.
1:05:18
I've written some plays.
1:05:20
I'm working on a short one now about like, the sense of alienation and like how you
1:05:25
can't really ever go home as the same person you were when you left like that.
1:05:30
The space that you left is going to fill in with other things.
1:05:33
And there's the same room, isn't there for you, you know.
1:05:37
Like, which is going to be its own metaphor about queerness, you know, like.
1:05:43
I just, I think.
1:05:48
So, yeah.
1:05:48
I think so, like, you know.
1:05:50
I, I want to make room, I want to make art with room for people like
1:05:54
me, like, my ideal goal with the major is to do some kind of writing.
1:06:01
Maybe that's some plays.
1:06:02
Maybe that's for like TV, because I work well in collaborative settings where I
1:06:06
can bounce ideas off and where I have guidance on where it's supposed to go.
1:06:09
Like, limitations always help.
1:06:12
But I also have a particular interest in maybe writing for video games, because I
1:06:15
think that interactive nature is really interesting, from like, just an analytic,
1:06:21
from a creative standpoint, like.
1:06:28
Have you ever-do you play video games?
1:06:30
Yes.
1:06:31
Have you ever played Celeste?
1:06:34
Yes.
1:06:34
I did not get very far, like.
1:06:37
It's hard.
1:06:38
Yeah, I think.
1:06:40
I saw people recommending it in relation to Hollow Knight.
1:06:43
And I like Hollow Knight better.
1:06:46
I do too, but I've just heard it's like a trans metaphor.
1:06:50
Yeah, yeah.
1:06:51
So, you think you're-
1:06:51
Yeah, yeah, like, climbing the mountain?
1:06:53
Yeah.
1:06:54
So are you thinking like that kind of video game writing, maybe?
1:06:58
Yeah.
1:06:59
Like I'm personally really interested in sort of things that
1:07:03
explore the impact of choice.
1:07:05
Like I have a giant soft spot for the Fable games.
1:07:10
Like, which are like, oh, you are a fantasy hero.
1:07:16
You make meaningful choices that affect the world.
1:07:20
Like,
1:07:23
it's, there's interesting things in relation to how it treats queerness,
1:07:27
because like in the first game, like you could only play as a guy, but you
1:07:30
could still like romance male NPCs.
1:07:34
Like, and I was like looking up to that l, like, I looking it up for some
1:07:38
reason, and I just come across like a fucking ancient game facts board.
1:07:42
Like we're a bunch of guys are talking about how they like to use
1:07:46
that to like, roleplay gay bashing.
1:07:50
Which I'm like, fuck!
1:07:53
What!?
1:07:53
This is not what I was looking for, you know?
1:07:56
Yeah.
1:07:57
Jeez.
1:07:57
No.
1:07:58
Yeah.
1:07:59
Or, like.
1:08:00
But like the later ones where you can play as a woman, like, you can
1:08:04
romance other woman, and it's fine.
1:08:06
No one gives you shit except, like, there is an interesting little tick
1:08:10
where, like, there is a quest in the second one where you, like, have to
1:08:14
romance an NPC for reasons and like the good option is you marry them.
1:08:18
The bad option is you give them a letter that makes them kill themselves.
1:08:21
It's, there's, there's, there's a convoluted backstory
1:08:24
to why this is happening.
1:08:26
Like it's not relevant, but like, fundamentally, that character
1:08:30
will always be the opposite gender of your player character.
1:08:33
There is no way to complete that quest as a good person who is a homosexual.
1:08:39
And that always stands out to me like.
1:08:42
But also, that's the game where there's a quest that lets you
1:08:46
trans your gender at the end of it.
1:08:48
It's, it's whack.
1:08:49
Like, it's, it's interesting the way things are like bounced between
1:08:57
sort of, like, interesting or useful or relatable things,
1:09:02
but also not understanding what they're doing sometimes,
1:09:07
like.
1:09:13
Yeah.
1:09:14
I like I would like to see that sort of thing approached with more intentionality.
1:09:22
It's.
1:09:23
I feel like sometimes I forget that queer people are a minority and
1:09:28
the vast majority of developers are going to be straight people
1:09:32
catering to straight audiences.
1:09:34
Yeah, but there's always hope.
1:09:37
Yep.
1:09:39
Okay.
1:09:40
One of my last
1:09:43
area of questioning, I guess, is surrounding your college
1:09:47
experience, whether that's influenced your gender in any way?
1:09:59
I think the experience I've had that really, like
1:10:03
articulated-like helped me refine my ideas about my gender weren't really
1:10:08
connected to OSU or being in college.
1:10:10
I think that they were mostly like extrinsic things, like the people
1:10:13
I talked to, like things I looked into with my own volition, you know.
1:10:18
That weren't related to my classes, like.
1:10:23
That's fair.
1:10:25
I remember taking this like Men and Masculinity class for honors credit
1:10:29
last year, and like, I was like, oh, so are we going to talk about, like,
1:10:33
other existent forms of masculinity?
1:10:35
Are we going to talk about, like butches?
1:10:39
Or?
1:10:39
No, no, this is patriarchy 101.
1:10:42
And I'm like, oh, okay.
1:10:43
I, I've read a lot of this, I know.
1:10:46
Okay.
1:10:48
Sure.
1:10:48
Like this wasn't what I was expecting, you know, like and I think I do like,
1:10:52
like I also like find myself in a bit of a bubble sometimes, you know.
1:10:56
Like, like I remember doing a presentation in, like, a different
1:11:02
honors class I'm taking about, like, just like we're supposed to do
1:11:05
something about, like, creativity in the quotidian, like about, like just
1:11:10
exciting, average forms of creativity.
1:11:11
And I'm like, so creativity and gender.
1:11:13
I know a bunch of people with really wild creative genders.
1:11:16
And I've got one myself, you know, like, and then I, like, went around
1:11:20
the room like, so like everyone wants to, like, try and articulate their self
1:11:24
and like they'll talk and they're like.
1:11:26
And then I remember, oh yeah, people are cis and don't think about these things.
1:11:32
Wow.
1:11:33
How
1:11:37
do you bear.
1:11:38
The Men and Masculinities, that's a Women, Gender and
1:11:41
Sexuality studies course, right?
1:11:42
Did you take any other of those or any queer studies courses besides that?
1:11:49
Like Vampires, Race, Gender and Sexuality is a colloquia, so it's like honors
1:11:52
college, but I think kind of tied into it.
1:11:55
And like, it wasn't for credit.
1:11:58
Like it was like.
1:12:01
Basically, I got to sit in like when I was in high school, one of my summers,
1:12:06
like my mom's ex-girlfriend was teaching a class, like, was basically doing like,
1:12:15
women, like, women-gender-sexuality 101, like as a summer course.
1:12:21
And she just let me sit in on it and do like, like I kept up.
1:12:24
I did the writing.
1:12:25
I did the reading, you know, like, but like I did take it, but not for credit.
1:12:31
Like I'm like, so no, I have taken other things.
1:12:38
Yeah.
1:12:38
So most of your learning, you said you did on your own volition and not through OSU.
1:12:43
Okay.
1:12:43
I respect that.
1:12:46
Finally, I guess, do you think how it like, do you think OSU's a
1:12:49
welcoming campus for queer people?
1:12:58
I've never experienced anything to the contrary, I think.
1:13:02
That's fair.
1:13:05
When people I talk to are generally pretty cool about like
1:13:08
who I am as a person and like.
1:13:12
There might be some degree of confusion with relation to, like, how to address
1:13:16
me and how to like refer to me.
1:13:18
But generally, as a rule, like, I'm, I feel welcomed.
1:13:25
Okay.
1:13:27
That's all the questions I had.
1:13:28
I don't know if you had any other artifacts or that you wanted to share.
1:13:32
Those are the ones I brought.
1:13:33
Okay.
1:13:33
I love them.
1:13:34
Okay.
1:13:35
Did you have anything else you want to add?
1:13:37
Or you feel like we didn't cover?
1:13:39
Nothing I can think of.
1:13:40
Okay.
1:13:42
Awesome.
1:13:42
Well, thank you for this interview.
1:13:45
It was very fun.
1:13:46
Thank you.
