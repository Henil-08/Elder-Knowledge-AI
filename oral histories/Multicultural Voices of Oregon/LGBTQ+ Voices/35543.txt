00:00
Okay.
00:00
Today is February 11th, 2024.
00:03
I'm here with Sophia over zoom and I'm in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:08
Where are you at today?
00:09
I'm in Corvallis, Oregon, as well.
00:12
Cool.
00:12
Okay.
00:13
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:16
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:19
Welcome to the interview.
00:21
Do you just want to reiterate for the interview how you identify
00:24
and what your pronouns are.
00:26
Yes.
00:27
My name is Sophia Williams.
00:28
I identify as a cis-woman, so she/her pronouns.
00:35
And I think that, should I introduce- I don't know.
00:40
Yeah that works.
00:41
That works.
00:42
All right.
00:45
So we're going to start with the beginning, with your childhood.
00:48
Can you just talk a little bit about, maybe experiences you had
00:52
in your childhood that you think were formative for your gender?
00:55
What kind of activities were involved in, stuff like that?
01:00
Yeah.
01:01
Honestly, sometimes I think my childhood was pretty interesting
01:07
in comparison to other peoples.
01:10
So my mom was actually like the breadwinner, I guess you would say.
01:15
Like she was the one working all the time.
01:17
My dad was a stay at home dad.
01:18
Like, it was kind of interesting because the roles were reversed.
01:22
So when I was with my friends, oftentimes their moms would always
01:26
be the ones around, like we would be hanging out and like, my dad would
01:29
become friends with their moms and like, my mom would be the one who'd
01:33
have to, like, come meet everybody.
01:35
So
01:37
it was kind of interesting seeing how that formed a lot of different ways,
01:44
I think now, or the way I act now, seeing my mom being the one who was
01:50
always kind of like the head of the house, I guess, in a way, working a lot.
01:55
To me, it was normal for my dad to be a stay at home dad.
01:58
I was just, like, chillin' with that.
02:01
For my hobbies, I really have always loved, fashion and, like, fashion design.
02:08
I, like, can remember just having these booklets of, like.
02:13
I don't know if you've seen them before, but they would be like croquis,
02:17
kind of like just like bodies, but like, you could draw on outfits.
02:20
And I had like stacks of those books just because they were fun to like
02:24
draw little outfits in all the time.
02:26
And, my parents always had us do one sport at all times, kind of.
02:33
But I'm not I'm not really a sporty person.
02:36
So I had to, like, find my way in that like, tried ballet.
02:40
Was not, not a ballet girl.
02:44
There was like, I did soccer for indoor soccer for a little while, just when I
02:48
was like, kind of in elementary school.
02:52
That was okay.
02:55
I did swimming in, which I liked swimming, but then they started to introduce,
02:58
like, really hard, like conditioning.
03:03
And I was not a fan of that either.
03:05
So, I was like, no, I did this for fun.
03:08
I'm not going to do that anymore.
03:11
Then I found volleyball in like, fifth or sixth grade, and that's when I really,
03:15
really liked, I ended up really liking that sport and pursued that until high
03:19
school, when I ultimately end up stopping.
03:22
Another thing I did that I felt like really changed the way I was as a person
03:29
was I was in a band and not like-I did do other music like orchestra,
03:33
but I was in like a band, like a guitar, like drums, singer, stuff.
03:39
We would play at like, like little pub things like, and stuff.
03:43
And that was great.
03:44
I was scared, really.
03:46
I was so, I was really, really shy before that.
03:50
But my parents made me do it because they were like, if you don't like it,
03:55
you can stop, but just try it out.
03:57
And I ended up loving it.
03:59
And I feel like that personally made me become a lot more outgoing because
04:03
I had to be on stages and like, just pretend that I wasn't really afraid
04:07
of everybody in the room at first.
04:09
But as soon as I kind of got the hang of it, I realized it
04:12
wasn't really that scary anymore.
04:14
And I actually like people.
04:16
And so, like, talking to people was a lot easier and doing stuff like that.
04:23
Would you like me to go into detail about any certain thing?
04:26
I haven't talked [indistinguishable] it could go on.
04:31
The band thing-what instrument do you play in the band?
04:34
I sang, and then I played the keyboard.
04:36
So, like piano-type stuff?
04:39
Yeah.
04:40
Do you still do that?
04:42
I do, I'm sad because I don't have a piano or like a keyboard here in
04:47
Corvallis, but when I go home, I play a lot like on the piano that we
04:51
have even I'm working on getting a keyboard down here, but it's kind of
04:55
hard with travel, like the size of it.
04:58
And just like I always, I'm missing pieces.
05:01
But I do like playing and singing still.
05:04
Like I'll sing in my room and stuff, but.
05:09
Cool.
05:09
Yeah.
05:11
So, you mentioned your mom was the breadwinner.
05:13
I was wondering if, like, she was a type of role model of you for femininity?
05:17
Or maybe anyone else, if not your mother?
05:20
Yeah, I would say two really strong, like, feminine role models
05:26
for me is my mom and my grandma.
05:29
My grandma on my dad's side.
05:32
Very different, very different archetypes.
05:36
But, my mom is a very, like, worker, always working.
05:42
She can.
05:44
Yeah.
05:44
If I'm thinking of, like, femininity versus masculinity and where those
05:49
intersect, like, I feel like she's kind of in the middle, like feminine, but
05:55
not, like, super outwardly feminine.
05:58
Not very, not very romantic type.
06:02
Not very, like, that type of way.
06:06
But I really admired her work ethic and her ability to always get things done.
06:13
And her ability of knowledge, she's a very intelligent woman.
06:17
And then I have my grandma-and my mother's a very motherly person.
06:21
Like, she's always caring and stuff, but it's just she is a little bit more,
06:25
especially when I was younger, a little more kind of just a very working person.
06:33
But my grandma, we were we were with my grandma a lot as well.
06:37
After my dad had to go back to work for financial purposes and stuff, he
06:43
would just kind of work part time.
06:45
He was a teacher, so he kind of worked at, like, different,
06:51
colleges, like the community colleges and then high schools, too.
06:55
But that was later, like at first it was just a few classes at like college.
06:59
So, we would stay with my grandma a lot.
07:01
She would take care of us a lot.
07:02
We lived in the same town.
07:05
She would always take care of us, and she was more of the stay-at-home mom type.
07:10
Like, she had, like, five children, mostly took care of them.
07:15
And then she was working, too.
07:16
She worked at, a fabric store.
07:19
She's a seamstress, so she would always be making clothes.
07:22
And that's where I got a lot of my, I feel like, creativity.
07:26
I mean, my mom is an artist.
07:28
Like, she makes beautiful, beautiful paintings, but she is not
07:32
very-she doesn't do that anymore.
07:34
And she doesn't like to do that.
07:35
So, like, when I went to creativity, like doing things with my grandma, she would
07:39
always do every single project with me.
07:41
Whatever I wanted to do, she just would get the projects for
07:44
me and my sisters work on them.
07:46
She's very, very kind.
07:48
Very like nurturing in a way.
07:50
I mean, it's kind of, I feel like my mom has both, like, I feel like they
07:54
both have certain qualities of each.
07:57
But I think those two people really impacted, like who I am and
08:00
how I carry myself as a person.
08:02
I guess I would say.
08:06
Do you think your, dad impacted you at all, being the one that
08:09
would stayed at home the most?
08:11
I definitely am a daddy's girl, slash was a daddy's girl.
08:19
Yeah, I was with my dad, like, so, so much like, me and my dad were just,
08:24
like, best friends all the time.
08:26
And, I definitely got a lot of qualities from him.
08:32
Especially just because he was a very, very, like, caring, nurturing person.
08:38
Like, he would always put his, like, daughters before everybody.
08:41
He would always just.
08:42
He did ballet with us.
08:44
Yeah.
08:45
He got invited to do The Nutcracker with my sister, and he was
08:48
like, okay, sure, I'll do it.
08:50
So, he was in The Nutcracker with her.
08:52
He was never afraid to do any type of anything with us.
08:56
He would do whatever he, we wanted to do, and he would, but he was still a very
09:02
like, he was a very masculine person.
09:05
So seeing how he can be feminine in that, like you're still a masculine
09:11
presenting and like, you know, he was a wrestler, strong, worked out a lot
09:16
like, but he made us strong like that.
09:20
So, like we wrestled with him.
09:22
Like he made sure that we could take care of ourselves.
09:25
And he always made sure that we knew that we could take care of ourselves,
09:29
and we don't need to rely on anybody.
09:31
And both my parents, that was a very strong value that they instilled in me
09:34
is my independence and my ability to take care of myself and handle myself
09:39
while still being kind and understanding.
09:43
And,
09:46
I don't know, I guess that's the best phrasing I could put
09:49
it, but yeah, I don't know.
09:50
I feel like those are the three main people that impacted me the most out
09:54
of, like, everyone in my life for sure.
09:57
And like authority or like, like, you know, not like at the same
10:02
level as you like, you know.
10:05
A parental guardian type of role.
10:07
Yeah.
10:07
Was there anyone,
10:11
like, your age, I guess, that influenced you.
10:14
I mean, I had a lot of different friends, friend experiences,
10:23
friend groups.
10:25
Like my sister.
10:27
I have a little sister.
10:29
She definitely impacted how I am as a person.
10:33
And, well, when you grow up as someone, it's just very, very, just a unique
10:39
bonding experience with that person.
10:41
At least for me it was,
10:44
we did pretty much everything together.
10:46
My dad always was like, never leave anybody out.
10:49
Everybody, include everybody and all that stuff.
10:52
So, we did everything together.
10:55
She is much, she was a much more-I was a, like, a shy talk-to-nobody,
11:01
like, just kind of in my own-and that's not who I am now at all.
11:05
But it's like the complete opposite.
11:07
But when I was kid, like, I was like, super hide-from-people-at-my-own-birthday
11:13
party, like, and stuff.
11:15
And she was very like the opposite of that.
11:20
Very outgoing, so cute, very charismatic, very diva-ish sometimes, but in, like,
11:29
a good way, I guess there were some moments, but, but then I feel like I, like
11:34
I said, I was like, really, really shy.
11:36
I did barely talk to anybody.
11:38
My friends that I had were like, my friends I like, and that's it.
11:42
And like, and I was fine with that.
11:43
I did not mind being alone at all.
11:45
I honestly felt like I was really ignorant to the fact that people
11:48
cared about having friends.
11:50
Like, I just was kind of like, okay, well, if you want to hang out, cool.
11:55
If not, I'm still gonna hang out here.
11:58
Like, yeah, I don't know, but I met my best friend from one of my previous best
12:04
friends, but she's now my best friend.
12:06
Like family.
12:07
She's like my sister.
12:08
And I feel like when I became friends with her in our old friend group,
12:12
is when I began to really find myself and find who I wanted to be.
12:17
I became a lot more outgoing.
12:18
I came out more confident and surer of myself and knowing that,
12:22
oh, I don't, I know that I have my friends like, these are my friends.
12:26
I don't care about anybody else.
12:27
Like they think I'm funny.
12:28
We like, we have a good time.
12:30
Nobody else really matters.
12:32
And then that's when I really started being more outgoing, talking to
12:36
more people, really establishing my own uniqueness and being okay if
12:42
people don't like me or if people don't like certain things I did.
12:46
And that's, and then that's kind of got me here, I guess.
12:52
Yeah.
12:52
You've talked about all these people that were like, influences on you,
12:57
like, where do you see yourself in, within the spectrum of femininity?
13:03
It's kind of interesting because sometimes I feel like I'm a pretty feminine person.
13:08
I
13:10
wouldn't say I'm super masculine, but I think that I do have
13:15
certain masculine qualities.
13:17
I think that sometimes I can be more masculine and, like,
13:22
instead of, like, hyper feminism.
13:25
But I think I definitely lean more towards a little bit more of the
13:29
stereotypical feminism that you see then versus like more masc. But I
13:34
think I have certain qualities where I would say I'm pretty, like, assertive.
13:38
I would say I'm pretty gonna, you know, say my opinion.
13:44
I'm not going to back down, really, on a lot of, like, I'm not going
13:48
to easily back down in a way of like just getting, I don't know.
13:56
I definitely think that I'm trying to, like, I'm trying I don't know, it's
14:01
kind of hard to put into words, but I think it's at a point where it's like
14:05
certain times I'll be a little bit more masculine or have masculine traits,
14:08
or even dress a little bit more, even though I really typically am pretty high,
14:13
like feminism, feminine, like feminine.
14:17
That's what I meant.
14:20
Yeah.
14:21
Yeah, that
14:26
makes sense.
14:27
You said something that I wanted to circle back on, but I forgot it.
14:30
So we're
14:36
just gonna keep on moving.
14:37
Yeah, so,
14:42
you mentioned something about stereotype, like stereotypes of femininity.
14:45
Do you ever feel like constrained by those stereotypes or even
14:49
just as a woman in this society?
14:54
Yes, sometimes.
14:56
Okay...yes.
14:58
I guess I feel like, I don't know, I feel-not necessarily constrained because
15:06
I know at the end of the day that personally, I believe I can do whatever
15:11
I want or I am able or capable to.
15:14
I know that might not be the case for everybody, but for me, I personally
15:18
don't feel constrained in certain,
15:22
like, I'm constraining myself in any way.
15:24
But I definitely do see some constraints in terms of like
15:29
just being a woman in society.
15:33
Just with like, I don't know.
15:37
I've had a lot of experiences where, you know, people don't really take
15:41
you seriously because you're a woman, I guess, in certain areas or,
15:50
yeah, I don't know.
15:50
I feel like certain times people will believe like, I don't know, maybe you
15:56
couldn't do it or maybe you-I can't, like, pinpoint a specific moment, really.
16:02
I'm
16:07
trying to, like, think about a specific time, but I definitely think
16:10
that there are some restrictions in a certain sense of just patriarchal.
16:16
Being, how we've lived that long and it being such embedded into the societal
16:22
culture and everything, that there's going to be restrictions because of your gender.
16:28
I just personally think that being as I've seen that and lived that,
16:33
especially in terms of like non-binary people or something like that, I feel
16:39
like they face those issues as well because of the fact that there are
16:46
restrictions, in a sense, of people like to put things into a binary.
16:51
So, it gets, I feel like it kind of constrains a lot of people, in a way.
17:03
That makes sense.
17:06
Were there any other significant influences on your
17:11
gender that weren't people?
17:13
Like, I don't know if you're religious, but maybe your religion,
17:16
if your family was religious, maybe a job you had, where you grew up.
17:21
Okay.
17:23
I grew up,
17:26
in Tacoma, Washington, so the Pacific Northwest, which I felt, well, I love
17:31
the Pacific Northwest just because I personally feel it's very much more
17:35
welcoming than other environments I've heard about from across the states.
17:39
I
17:42
felt like for the majority of the time, like it felt like, like for
17:48
me, in my experience, I felt like everyone was equal in my brain
17:52
and like how I was seeing things.
17:54
But like, you know, as you grow up, you see, like that's not necessarily
17:58
the case or hearing certain people talk about certain things.
18:02
I know my family was religious.
18:05
They were Catho-like, well, my grandparents are still religious,
18:09
but my personal nuclear family was not super religious.
18:14
It was kind of just like bringing you... We were like spiritual, but then we
18:18
would go to like Catholic school and like or like Sunday school or something.
18:22
And it's like bringing you the ability to choose what you wanted to do, I guess,
18:28
in a way, like my parents kind of framed it like, there's a lot out there so
18:32
you can, like, explore these different things and choose these different things.
18:36
My grandparents, however, did want us to be like baptized, in Catholic school,
18:40
communion, all that kind of stuff.
18:42
I, personally, didn't feel like that impacted me that much, just because
18:45
I think a lot of the times when I was doing the church stuff, I don't think I
18:49
was really thinking much about anything.
18:51
I just kind of doing it, because I felt like I had to do that.
18:55
So I was just like in here.
18:56
And plus I was like ten.
18:58
So I really didn't grasp anything that was going on.
19:00
I was kind of at a school doing something.
19:03
But, spirituality is something that I've grown to be more comfortable
19:10
in and understand a little bit more.
19:13
I felt like my parents really like, took those, like, beliefs and like.
19:19
Yeah, I felt like that was more important to my childhood.
19:22
Like certain saging practices we did a lot.
19:25
And, ever since I can remember, we would talk about crystals and stuff like that.
19:32
We just talked about the different things that are out there that
19:36
could possibly be the case, I guess.
19:39
I feel like that's been interesting to navigate as I get older and
19:44
kind of straying away from like religion, especially with the
19:48
constructs that religion-specifically like Catholic and Christianity,
19:55
personally, from my experience-would have brought to the table.
20:01
I really struggle with, when people, well, a lot of people, well not a
20:06
lot of people, but I know some people who believe that men are head of the
20:11
household or should be the provider, and I just don't align with that belief.
20:17
So I just feel like that doesn't really make sense for me, what I grew up with,
20:22
like everything that I've experienced, just doesn't really make sense to me.
20:26
I personally feel like I should be more of an equal, just like
20:30
partnership thing going on.
20:33
But, so I've definitely had some experiences where people I know are like
20:39
that or like try to instill beliefs like that or question people how I believe,
20:44
I guess, in a way of like those beliefs.
20:47
So that has been interesting as I've grown up to see certain people
20:51
believe that and certain people like drift from that, I guess.
20:58
Yeah.
21:00
Yeah.
21:01
You mentioned that "providing" is kind of associated with
21:05
masculine people and masculinity.
21:07
And I've heard people say like, being a protector is also
21:10
associated with masculinity.
21:11
Do you think that all those traits should be equal, like between the two?
21:18
Or do you think there's any that kind of like lend one to the other?
21:23
I definitely can understand,
21:28
like, there being more, like, I don't know if I'm thinking about
21:33
like the yin yang type vibe or pieces of a whole, like it makes sense to
21:37
have more traits than the other.
21:39
I don't think you should.
21:40
I personally don't think it necessarily needs to align to who's
21:43
more masculine, who's more feminine.
21:44
I think that in my, like, I'm trying to think about, especially my relationship.
21:52
Like we definitely like are a partnership.
21:57
But I think that sometimes, you know, he can be more of a
22:01
protector in maybe an emotional sense or even in a physical sense.
22:05
But also there's going to be times where I'm being the protector a little bit more.
22:10
I feel like it depends on the certain scenario that we're being put in.
22:14
I think that.
22:19
Because of biological differences.
22:21
A lot of times the male is seen as, or masculine people are seen as
22:25
more of the protector just because of their innate ability to do that.
22:29
But I don't think that the protector necessarily needs to be physical.
22:32
It could be emotional.
22:33
I think that both can take those parts, but I think it's about finding
22:39
the balance between both, I guess.
22:41
Like, in especially in femininity, like being the nurturer, being
22:45
like, a comfort person, I guess.
22:48
I think that the masculine person can have those traits as well.
22:52
I don't think that should be one or the other.
22:53
I think it's something that kind of maybe should alter in like a wave
22:57
pattern depending on the situation, like just kind of like parts of a
23:00
whole, like there's going to be light in the dark, there's going to be dark
23:04
in light, but in a sense there's going to be masculinity in femininity, but
23:08
there's also going to be femininity in masculinity with you at some point.
23:11
It's like it's just finding what fits to that person's,
23:17
personality identity or just like their relationships function in my opinion.
23:25
Yeah.
23:25
That makes sense.
23:27
Okay a little pre-question for the next, do you use social media?
23:30
Yes.
23:31
I do often.
23:32
Yes.
23:32
Do you, do you think that has influenced your gender in any way?
23:38
I don't know.
23:39
I, I don't know, I feel like I've been on social media for a long time, but I
23:43
also don't feel like I have someone who's ever struggled to find their like, gender
23:51
or feel like correct in that gender.
23:53
I've always felt pretty comfortable in my gender and who I am as a person.
24:00
I've noticed that, you know, sometimes I'm in more of a masculine vibe, especially
24:05
in terms of the way I dress or like some, but most of the time I feel pretty
24:09
feminine and I don't think, like I said, I honestly feel like I'm pretty oblivious or
24:15
was really oblivious when I was younger, I don't think and I don't really think
24:20
that's a bad thing, because I feel like a lot of times that stopped me from getting
24:25
hurt from like social media or bullying instances, like I truly did not care
24:30
about anybody else's, like impact on me.
24:33
It was mostly just how I felt about doing something which worked out
24:38
great because I was just felt.
24:42
I feel like that helped me at least.
24:44
And when I started using social media, I think more of the impact was maybe how
24:49
people were interacting with my social media or how people would, view it.
24:54
I have noticed, of course, I feel like this is good to note that when presenting
25:02
very feminine or very, I don't know, there's certain point where I, I would
25:07
have posted a little bit more, just like showy, I guess in a way those
25:12
would get more interactions or something like that, which is like interesting
25:17
when it's like, okay, you're kind of comparing what these are, but I don't
25:21
think it really constricted or impacted how I presented or how I felt about
25:26
myself very much, in terms of gender.
25:30
Well,
25:32
that makes sense with what you've told me so far.
25:34
So
25:36
you don't really get.
25:37
You don't really get any influence from outside sources.
25:41
So how do you choose how to, like, present yourself or like, express
25:46
your gender like day to day?
25:49
I, I don't even know.
25:54
It's like, I don't know, it's always hard for me.
25:55
I'm an apparel design major, but I always struggle to, like, I don't.
25:59
I'm not one of those people who, like hyper focuses on certain like.
26:03
Like, I know a lot of people be like, oh, this designer did
26:06
this, like, isn't that amazing?
26:07
I'm like, I don't even know who that is.
26:09
Honestly.
26:10
Like, if I see something, I'm like, oh, that's cool.
26:12
Like, if I see a TikTok, I'm like, wow, I really like can make that girl dresses,
26:16
or I really like the way that they dress or I really like the way that he dress.
26:18
I'm like, I'm gonna try that.
26:19
And I just start picking things from my closet.
26:22
I kind of just, I am really big into fashion person.
26:26
Not you cannot tell right now, but, I do love fashion, and, I like
26:33
to piece those things together.
26:34
I take a lot, like, I am a Pinterest girl.
26:35
I love Pinterest, so I surf that a lot.
26:39
So mostly I think I just take in a lot of information, I take
26:43
a lot of visual information.
26:45
And then like, I kind of use either the patterns that I see or things that I like.
26:49
I try to utilize that into my what I wear.
26:55
And how I present myself, that's kind of how I go about creating my
27:01
look or like my persona, I guess.
27:04
Yeah.
27:04
So would you say you dress more for style than for comfort, or
27:07
is it kind of like a mix of both?
27:09
Mostly style, less comfort.
27:11
As much as, like, comfort is amazing.
27:13
And I utilize, on days like this, I just feel a lot better about myself when
27:19
I'm wearing something cute, I like to.
27:22
I just like the way I like things to look aesthetically nice in
27:27
my, like the way I'm viewing it.
27:29
And if I wear a nice outfit, I feel better about myself and I feel happy for the day
27:34
because it's just something I like to do.
27:36
It brings me joy to piece all the pieces together and then to wear it for the day.
27:40
And just like, know that I'm looking the way that I want to look, I guess.
27:46
This might be a difficult question, but how do you know when something is
27:50
like aesthetically pleasing to you?
27:54
To me, it's just like, whatever I like is gonna, is gonna happen.
27:58
I don't know, I guess it's like so I'm right now especially I've been I look, I
28:04
actually always I love color, I actually the item I brought is like a million
28:08
colors and I love it but I like colors.
28:12
So sometimes I don't love to wear like black and white or like dull like
28:19
neutrals.
28:19
Honestly, a lot of days when I'm not feeling like ready to do the day, I will
28:25
just grab one of my favorites wraparound skirts that's like the brightest colors,
28:30
and then pair it with either just a regular plain top and I'll just wear it.
28:35
And then I know that I'm fine for the day.
28:36
Like I did't need to put too much effort in, but I still feel like I'm doing okay.
28:40
Like then other things.
28:42
I do a lot of trend watching, I guess.
28:45
Not in the sense of like, I need to know what's up, but it's my
28:48
job to do a lot of those things.
28:50
I work in marketing and I work, you know, I'm working on be in
28:54
the apparel design industry.
28:55
So it's kind of something that I try to work on, just, being that I deal
29:01
with media and things that are trend like, but I don't like to just follow
29:09
what trend because it's trending.
29:10
I like to like the trend.
29:11
So, trying to think I really like how right now I've been really
29:19
taken with the idea of stars.
29:21
I seen star shapes being the likes a lot more recently in
29:25
the last like year or two.
29:26
And now I'm just starting to be like, okay, now I like it.
29:30
Now I'm going to start using it.
29:32
It's kind of like it's been popular, it's coming back down.
29:35
Maybe it'll go back up, I don't know, but I like it now.
29:37
So now I'm like, okay, I'm going to start incorporating that into certain
29:42
things I design or certain articles I try to piece together, I guess.
29:50
Where-what do you want to do with your degree?
29:55
That's a great question.
29:56
Well,
29:59
okay, I'm kind of trying to figure that out still, because there's just so many
30:03
different ways you can go about it.
30:04
You can be a tech designer.
30:05
I don't love that idea, but it's what a lot of people do.
30:09
But personally, I want to be kind of like, in the creative side and less
30:13
the technical side of things like brainstorming these like apparel
30:18
ideas or even styling certain individuals or something like that.
30:23
It's more my speed than doing the technical path, sort of like, how does
30:27
this piece together, how does it do that?
30:29
I mean, those are great things to understand when designing, but I like
30:33
the design part, the design part where it's mostly like you're creatively
30:39
thinking about it and not the technical aspect of how does this piece together,
30:43
how are you going to make this piece?
30:44
How does it go?
30:45
I like to visually piece it together, and eventually I would like to have
30:52
my own brand of just my own line.
30:56
I guess in a way, that's much more in the future.
30:59
But, you know, that'd be great.
31:02
Mostly I'm trying to look into like a design, like ten years in the future
31:06
design director, where it's like running the design process and what goes out
31:10
to what offices and how that and then the technical people take it and run.
31:14
But right after college, we're going to see what happens when I apply.
31:19
But that's kind of the direction I'm trying to go in.
31:23
This is a bit of a tangent, but since you're going into this industry, what are
31:26
your thoughts on like fast fashion and like how you're going to work with that?
31:33
I don't really like fast fashion in the sense of I just, I don't know, like I get
31:41
mass market, like ready to wear stuff.
31:46
I mean, that's what a lot of most people are going to be wearing stuff
31:49
from like, I don't even know, I don't shop at, I mostly thrift shop.
31:55
So it's hard like, Target or something have ready to wear your stuff.
31:59
And I don't think that you can escape that.
32:01
But things like Shein, it's like where it really irks me just because of
32:05
the fact that A, they're ripping off designers who already made that product,
32:10
but B, there's so much clothing in landfill that I don't understand why
32:15
we can't utilize that material more.
32:17
I don't understand why I, we're over, like we're, I feel like people
32:25
are promoting overconsumption by being like, each thing is like $2.
32:29
Yeah, it's $2 because A, it's made shit-ily, B, they're not like morally
32:37
great companies that are making these.
32:40
There's a lot just there's a lot of production for like,
32:44
it's just it's not a good thing.
32:46
I'm not as well versed and I just don't like it.
32:50
And I just try to avoid things like I can't avoid certain things, like Amazon.
32:54
I mean, you have to order certain things on Amazon, especially
32:57
just in our day and age.
32:58
But like, I won't shop on Shein, like I will avoid that place, like Temu
33:04
or something like that, just because, like, I don't feel like it's right.
33:07
But to each your own.
33:10
They're, that's an individual decision.
33:12
But I do think the apparel company, like I think the apparel industry is to accept
33:17
the fact that they need to start being more sustainable and more transparent
33:21
about their business practices, and from a moral standards, from a sustainability
33:26
standard of the fact that, like our Earth is being affected and we don't
33:29
really need to be using certain harmful techniques, especially like people
33:38
don't have drinking water in the towns near factories because of the fact that
33:42
their dyes are running into the water.
33:43
And that's not acceptable because they should have access to drinking water.
33:47
They should have access to live in a town that they grew
33:50
up in and they are living in.
33:53
There's ways to go about that.
33:55
It might be more expensive, it might be longer.
33:57
But in the long run of humanity, it's more likely better, for humans, and Earth.
34:05
Yeah.
34:06
Okay.
34:06
Cool.
34:06
Thanks for sharing.
34:07
To get back on track, you mentioned you mentioned your object.
34:12
So, do you want to go ahead and share that now?
34:14
Yes, I only have one, but I have like a million things around my room
34:18
that I could grab if you want more.
34:19
But one is fine.
34:21
This is the main one that I. It's kind of big.
34:24
This is just the dress that I grabbed because I wanted to choose something that
34:30
was clothing because I love clothing.
34:32
But this is, I'm pretty sure it's vintage.
34:37
I'm pretty sure it's like a vintage, little dress.
34:40
I don't know, I thought it was vintage, so I was like, yes, I got it at the
34:44
Goodwill and, like, three-oh, gosh.
34:48
I think three years ago.
34:49
Wow.
34:50
That's crazy.
34:51
I
34:53
wore this for my graduation pictures in high school.
34:57
I wear it a lot now, especially in the spring and the summer, just
35:01
because the fabric is very breathable.
35:05
It's very sheer.
35:06
It feels like you're wearing nothing.
35:08
I like skirts because then I can, like, spread my legs out all over the place.
35:13
And also, I just like not wearing pants.
35:16
So, I like to wear things that are breathable and fun.
35:19
But I really like the low neck cut because I like the way that my chest
35:24
looks in a top like this and, I feel like it accentuates my body shape more then.
35:31
And yeah, the material and mainly the color in the pattern is why I
35:35
love this so much, just because it's really bright and it has a bunch of
35:40
colors and I just love that, I guess.
35:44
It gives a 70s look.
35:46
I'm a big vintage look kind of person.
35:49
So yeah, I was gonna say that looks very 70s.
35:51
And you mentioned you thrift shop a lot.
35:54
Like why do you find yourself drawn to, like, vintage clothes, I guess?
35:58
I don't really know.
36:00
I've never I've never really understood ever since I was little.
36:03
I've always liked vintage things.
36:04
I like old things is probably because my mom is a massive thrifter.
36:08
I referred to as "the thrift god" because she is like, she could own a
36:14
thrift store honestly, at this point.
36:15
But she's-oh, I mean, at first, I really hated thrift shopping
36:19
because I didn't like the fact that I couldn't get the clothes that
36:22
other people were getting at school.
36:23
But then I realized that there's so many better options at thrift
36:29
store, I hit an age and I was like, wow, wait, I was wrong.
36:33
This is cool.
36:34
And now I'm obsessed with this.
36:35
And so, that was like maybe like 14, 15 maybe, I don't know.
36:42
But yeah, I don't know.
36:44
Ever since I was little, I've loved, like, old telephones, just like old cameras.
36:48
I just like the way they look.
36:50
I like just the.
36:51
I don't know what it is.
36:52
I just like it.
36:54
I really don't know where that started.
36:55
It was.
36:56
I've always been that way since I can remember, when I started
37:00
liking vintage clothes, though, is like, I think I was around eighth
37:05
grade going into ninth grade.
37:06
And at that point I had been very,
37:12
I had been very hard on myself on the fact of I was really weird in
37:16
middle school, and so I felt like I need to overcompensate and be
37:19
like, really normal dressing wise.
37:24
And so those clothes were really not cute at all.
37:27
But I would wear certain, like whatever was trendy or popular, I would try
37:32
to wear those clothing because I knew that I was like, well, I've made it
37:35
to a spot now where I've left this weird kid look, I can be a normal.
37:40
And then I was just like, wait, I actually hate all of you people
37:43
at my school, and I don't really want to dress like this anymore.
37:47
And then one day I was like, oh wait, I could just actually
37:51
dress the way I want to.
37:52
And then I started and people did not really-it was kind of funny because
37:55
actually there were some people who love the way I dress because I'm dressed really
37:59
80s for a while, because I just liked the 80s and the 70s and all that stuff.
38:04
And then some people really did not like it, which I kind of found funny because
38:08
I was like, okay, you don't have to like it, but that it's good to know that
38:12
you don't like it, actually, because I feel like I'm doing something right.
38:15
If somebody doesn't dislike it, then maybe it's not good enough.
38:19
I don't know, but like, it's not it's not unique enough.
38:23
I don't know, I feel I feel a lot of times I've done unique things in the
38:26
past and people didn't like it, but it was unique enough for them to recognize
38:31
that it was me and that's what I wanted.
38:33
So, I welcome the haters.
38:36
But that eighth grade is really when I started to, like, incorporate
38:42
into my style because I realized I could do this and where I'm
38:46
going to shop can utilize that.
38:49
And it's unique.
38:50
I didn't want to look like everybody else.
38:51
I didn't enjoy a lot of the people there.
38:54
So, I was like, you know, just going to do my own thing and it works.
38:58
So, that's my, little bit into why I like the vintage.
39:04
I think it's probably because my mom probably likes vintage stuff and
39:07
brings it around all the time, too.
39:12
Yeah, that's that's cool.
39:14
You mentioned that you don't really care what people say about you.
39:19
I really respect you for that.
39:22
But kind of like, along those lines, when have you felt most at home in your body?
39:29
Yeah, I felt like it.
39:31
Okay.
39:31
When I was in, I mean, this was just such a rough time for people like.
39:36
And that was, like, not a good time for me to feel comfortable in my
39:41
body and everything just because of the fact that I was kind of weird
39:45
and, and in societal standards here.
39:48
I mean, that's okay.
39:49
I actually, I am a weird kid and I'm okay with that, but
39:52
it's okay, like to be weird.
39:53
It's cooler to be weird.
39:54
So I will accept that I am weird and that's fine.
39:58
But at the time I was not accepting of that.
40:00
So I was like, no, I have to be normal.
40:02
Like, I have to abide by these things.
40:05
And once I started being like, oh, I guess people really don't care, I don't know.
40:10
I was like, in my mind when, I don't know what happened when I hit 8th - 9th grade,
40:14
but all of a sudden I was like, why do I care about any of these people's opinions?
40:18
I think it was my friend group, because at the time, I had such a supportive
40:21
friend group that I really did not care about anybody at school because
40:26
I wasn't hanging out with them.
40:27
I wasn't like having a good time with them.
40:29
And my parents, especially my father, always instilled, I've
40:34
always had this sense of, I just always had the sense of like.
40:40
I don't know.
40:40
I don't care, I guess, in a way, and especially once I hit like a
40:44
teenage years, I was like, really couldn't care less about anyone
40:48
that was there just because I--If you don't like it, that's okay.
40:51
You can just not say it or just mind your business or like you don't have to like
40:57
not everybody's going to like everything.
40:59
And at the same time, it's I just realized that more people care about
41:04
themselves than they are caring about you.
41:06
So why are you trying to alter the way that you look when
41:10
ultimately they're still thinking about how they look for the day?
41:14
They're not thinking about your outfit the next day.
41:17
I can promise most people, and if they are they seriously have something going
41:22
on down, and they need to get that figured out because that's definitely
41:26
an issue that they should figure out.
41:28
But, I don't know what I don't like.
41:32
I think having those friendships and just like having the like, security of
41:37
like my family loves and cares about me, my friends love and care about me.
41:41
I really couldn't give a-...care
41:47
about, anybody who has to say anything.
41:50
And a lot of times, if people are going to be negative about something,
41:54
they're more likely insecure.
41:56
If someone just doesn't like something that's different, but if they're going
41:59
to bully you or like demean you, then they've got issues they need to work out.
42:04
So that's not to do with me.
42:06
That's their thing, I guess.
42:09
I don't know how to put it.
42:11
I just like, that's, I don't know.
42:15
So when you felt most at home in your body... always?
42:18
Oh yes!
42:20
No, I honestly have been really, really comfortable in my body.
42:23
I think the most comfortable I felt was, okay, I'm gonna say just out of,
42:30
like, how happy I was at the time and how free I was, was like my junior year
42:36
of high school just because I had found this, like this new group of friends.
42:40
I had gotten a partner, my new, my partner.
42:43
And like, I had been really just gotten into-really went coasting into
42:49
my fashion thing and, like, so I was like, really feel myself at that one.
42:53
And I have started dyeing my bangs every month.
42:57
So I had like this fun thing that I could change every month.
43:01
I was like, okay, this month my bangs are going to be pink, or my bangs
43:04
are going to be purple this month.
43:06
And I just felt like an it-girl, at that time, I think, I don't know,
43:09
I just felt like so comfortable and I, I'm very comfortable now.
43:13
I just think that that was such like a great little period of time that was just
43:18
so I didn't care about anything at all.
43:24
Nice.
43:26
Yeah.
43:27
So high school is a good time for you.
43:28
But I'm wondering it, like, how your college experience has,
43:33
like, how have you felt with it?
43:36
I have loved college a thousand times more than high school, actually.
43:40
I hated the high school that I went to.
43:41
I liked the friends that I had in high school, but that came to an end too.
43:46
So there's always there's always a give and take.
43:48
I didn't like the actual people at my high school.
43:50
I actually stopped.
43:51
I went to community college halfway through, so I really only went to
43:55
my high school for like two years and like, then I went to community
43:58
college and mostly was just doing my own stuff for those last two years.
44:03
Got my associates when I graduated and I came here, and I have
44:08
had a great time in college is stressful and really fucking hard.
44:12
So it has its moments where I'm like, why?
44:17
Why is this this way?
44:19
But that's more outside circumstances and mostly financial issues
44:23
like less so personal issues.
44:26
I felt I felt like in high school, there were a lot of times where you
44:31
would, at least for me, I would deal with a lot of mean girl behavior, clique
44:34
behavior, a lot of judgment people.
44:37
So working through that and then finally getting out of high school
44:41
and being like, finally, people don't actually care anymore.
44:44
Like nobody can really.
44:47
There's no cliques, at least for me, I don't know, I don't think there's cliques.
44:51
I don't think that I mean, I think that it's possible.
44:54
There's possibility, but like, it's so big, at least
44:58
for me, it's big, big at OSU.
44:59
I feel like there's so many people that, like, really, nobody could
45:04
care less about the other person and they actually get their education.
45:09
They're there for them, like I that's what I liked about, college.
45:14
There has been some people that I know where I'm like, okay, you're
45:18
bringing back that high school mentality that I don't like, and
45:20
then I just never talk to them again.
45:22
And I just leave and I'm like, we're just not good.
45:25
I'll talk to you if I see you in public and we're-I will be cordial.
45:28
But I, not surrounding myself with people who just put that energy into judgment
45:36
and stereotypical beliefs of like.
45:42
I don't even.
45:42
I can't even go into that anymore.
45:44
It's like, just like I've found that I really have loved my roommate here.
45:50
I've loved the friends that I make here.
45:53
I've had a lot of great opportunities at OSU that I don't
45:56
think I would have had otherwise.
45:58
And
46:00
I like finding people that have the same passion as me for certain
46:03
things, like passionate about women in business, passionate about
46:07
apparel design, things like that.
46:11
So, I personally have loved college a lot.
46:14
But I don't know, maybe I'm just a positive person or something, but.
46:20
No, I feel like a lot of people do like college.
46:23
That's why I ask about it.
46:24
Just because, I know don't, wanna get everyone's opinion.
46:27
But you told me that you were in a sorority, right?
46:31
Can you talk about that a little bit?
46:32
Yes, yeah, I will specify that I'm in an academic sorority,
46:38
but it's still a sorority.
46:40
It's just not the main one to think about, I guess, in a sense.
46:44
And I chose that for a reason because I personally didn't vibe with the energy
46:50
of the people who I just don't personally want to be in, like the philanthropic,
46:57
I don't even know what they're called.
46:58
The regular sororities that you see, I guess I would say.
47:04
But the academic one, I'm in a design sorority, so I'm Chi Theta Phi,
47:08
and I really liked them because it just felt really, really inclusive.
47:13
I didn't feel like anybody was getting left out.
47:15
I didn't feel like there was this pressure to be like that type, like
47:21
that archetype that they're looking for, I guess for a regular sorority.
47:27
I just felt like there was kind of like an archetype that they were looking for.
47:31
I felt like this one harnessed creativity, harnessed the passions that you like.
47:35
In the, I'm in the Collective Greek Council, which is the academic one.
47:40
So there's like a science one, there's an engineering one, there's a design
47:44
one, and then there's another one that I, I can't remember right now, but
47:47
I think it's my math or something.
47:49
But I liked how those center around your interests kind of.
47:53
And you could connect with people who have similar interests
47:56
as you instead of just like.
48:00
I also did not want to live with a group of girls.
48:02
I was a big thing that was never, ever, ever going to do because that
48:06
sounds awful and it just didn't sound like you would be for me.
48:10
30 girls in one room.
48:11
Just, that's too much, for me.
48:15
And then, yeah, I just felt like, it's really there's a lot of fashion girls in
48:20
there, so I just, I everyone was really nice when I started my sorority, and I
48:25
was really, really excited to start it and be with people who have, like, interested
48:29
in similar things they want to do.
48:31
And it's been pretty good since then, I guess, for me.
48:38
Yeah, I don't know much about the academic sororities.
48:41
So you say they don't have houses?
48:43
What is it mostly that you guys do in there?
48:46
No, we have our regular- every week we have chapter and, we do a lot
48:52
of, like, we'll have sisterhood events where we'll get together.
48:56
Whoever can come will.
48:58
Well, I know they had a sisterhood where we went to the farmer's market.
49:03
I, unfortunately, was not able to go that day, but I think they did.
49:06
I think they went to, like, this market, like by the ocean or something.
49:10
They did like an ocean day.
49:12
So we do, like, fun things like that.
49:14
We are, we had,
49:20
we have like movie night.
49:22
We, it's nice because a lot of girls will support each other a lot
49:26
where it's like, oh, we're having, like, the fashion show this week.
49:29
Anybody, if you guys want to come, just come.
49:31
It's going to be fun.
49:32
And then like, a handful of girls will come and be like,
49:33
hey, like, we saw you, loved it.
49:36
All that stuff.
49:37
Oh my gosh.
49:38
So sorry.
49:39
My phone is ringing for some weird reason,
49:43
it's from Corvallis.
49:45
And then I feel like we just we have certain things, like philanthropic things.
49:51
I also think we still do philanthropies and stuff like that.
49:54
We're currently working on a specific philanthropy for next year, and then.
50:03
For next term, not next year.
50:05
We partner, we go to like other sororities, like philanthropies and stuff.
50:10
There was just, dino trivia for the science sorority.
50:15
But we do interact a lot with the main sororities.
50:18
Like we'll have we have Greek Week coming up.
50:20
We're all.
50:21
Every Greek life person is doing that like it's a big thing, but in like,
50:27
so everybody does the it's a week long thing where you raise money and
50:31
there's a bunch of events that you can do, and it's just kind of to be the
50:35
most active and just try your best.
50:37
And you know, when you're on a team of three different frats or sororities and
50:42
stuff, there's Sing in the spring where, we do like the dancing-singing thing.
50:47
I don't partake in that, but that's out of my personal choice.
50:51
But I'm not a good dancer.
50:54
But, we do lots of fun stuff.
50:57
But also, there's certain career things that we do, in terms of just, like,
51:02
supporting each other a lot of, like, because we have such like, interests, it's
51:06
like, oh, do you want to do the art club?
51:08
Okay, cool will support you.
51:10
Go to this.
51:11
Things like, I found a lot of models for my, like, runway looks from my
51:15
sorority because they just are so willing and so supportive of, like, my work.
51:19
And it's just really nice to have that support system in college when you're
51:25
doing that kind of stuff, I guess.
51:29
Yes.
51:29
You mentioned the like archetype I guess for like the sororities
51:34
that everyone thinks of when someone says you're in a sorority.
51:38
How do you think that, like, the expectations differ in the
51:43
type of sorority that you're in?
51:47
I don't-it's very interesting.
51:49
I feel like from my personal perspective.
51:52
The
51:55
main, I don't know, I'm trying to remember what they're called,
51:58
but, just like the main, like I'm
52:02
just going to call it, like the philanthropic one.
52:04
Yeah.
52:04
I don't think that's the right term, but the, the I just felt like I've met
52:09
a lot of girls in there that were very judgmental in, like, in a way you could
52:15
just, while some though, I've met some that are great, really amazing people.
52:19
Some that's good.
52:20
You're going to have bad apples though.
52:22
There's going to be some.
52:23
And I just personally didn't feel the most comfortable being around thirty
52:28
of those, like thir- I don't know, just personally, I felt like they're
52:31
a little more uptight, a little more stereotypical when it comes to like,
52:37
society's like thin-white-blond-girl, I guess you would say that's just the.
52:43
But I'm not saying they're all like that.
52:45
I'm not saying that everybody thinks that.
52:47
I just think that historically speaking and, societally speaking,
52:54
those are typically the ones that stand out the most in the ones that, I feel
52:58
like when you're an outsider especially, definitely just carry myself differently
53:05
than a lot of the girls that I've seen in the sororities do carry themselves
53:08
sometimes that I just couldn't really.
53:11
I didn't think I would fit in very well, and I didn't really
53:14
want to live with 30 girls.
53:17
Never sounds great.
53:18
I've heard horrible stories about that, and I just, doesn't sound like a fun time.
53:23
Don't want to do it.
53:26
But the girls that I know from that type of, sorority,
53:31
they're all really, really nice.
53:32
But they do have their stories of, like, certain judgy girls.
53:36
And I think that that's just the case when you put a lot of.
53:41
I find that people that are going straight into that especially, like
53:44
right after graduating, are looking for something that's more high
53:47
school-ish or like something they can kind of grasp on to a little bit.
53:52
Whereas, like, I found a lot of people in my sorority or sororities
53:55
like that are a little bit more like, okay, well, I didn't want to join the
53:59
main sorority because of like, just like, I don't know, a personal reason.
54:04
I didn't feel like I would fit in there,
54:08
and come in later being like, okay, I like this hobby.
54:11
I just kind of appreciate that it's like interest based instead
54:14
of just like random 30 girls.
54:17
Like, you don't know how that's going to go.
54:19
You don't know if they even like anything about each other.
54:21
And I just there's going to be mean girls to every single thing.
54:25
But I just, I think that I personally didn't vibe the most with,
54:33
that those groups just because I don't feel like I fit in
54:36
the best there, I guess.
54:41
I think that makes sense.
54:42
And I, I do agree with the high school thing, and it's a very, it seems like
54:48
a very specific type of femininity that they're looking for in those sororities.
54:53
So yeah, I definitely can see that.
54:56
I can definitely see that.
54:58
Sometimes, I definitely, when you're looking at all of them or like, I
55:02
know we did this event, it's like the Greek tunnel for like freshmen and
55:06
like it's really interesting being like because I don't know, I always
55:10
feel like a little bit of an outsider.
55:13
I mean were working, I know my sorority, like, leadership, is working really
55:16
hard on trying to partner more with other sororities and other frats
55:20
to try not be as much of outsiders, because I know sometimes I think
55:23
that's how they think of us, even though we are an established sorority.
55:26
Like, I just think that because we're not the stereotypical like one that's
55:31
been around for like 100 years, which has its own complications,
55:38
that I think that they kind of think of us as outsiders sometimes, even though
55:42
we're are actively working on that.
55:44
But I think it's just evident when your kind of like in a group.
55:47
But I've had, I have had good experiences with anyone, like, from.
55:53
I've had good experiences with someone from most sororities, just I've also
55:57
had some bad times with some people.
56:00
That's just how life is, I guess.
56:03
I'd agree.
56:05
Alright.
56:05
Well, I think we've gone through all my questions.
56:07
Is there anything else you wanted to add or anything you felt we didn't cover?
56:12
I don't know.
56:15
I'm not exactly sure, honestly, I think that it's I, I really liked
56:21
the topic of conversation today.
56:23
I thought it was very fun and interesting.
56:25
So, thank you for letting me be here and do that.
56:31
I think that one thing that's really, I think that I really liked noting
56:35
on was just having that difference of like mother, father, like kind
56:40
of like parental role switch up.
56:42
Just because I feel like that has impacted me so much in comparison
56:46
to how I see a lot of people who are raised in the opposite way,
56:50
like how they've grown up to think.
56:52
It's very, I think that is really an interesting topic of conversation for
56:57
me, just because I can see it's so opposite from the other side, which
57:01
is so abnormal for a lot of people.
57:05
But yeah, other than that it was just fun talking, so.
57:08
Yeah, it was fun.
57:10
Well, thank you for doing this for me.
