00:00
Our names are Nicholas Hawkins and Jacob Dimm.
00:04
We are students at Oregon State University U-Engage Class, “Untold
00:07
Stories, People of Color in Oregon.” Today’s date is Thursday October 30,
00:13
2014, and we are conducting an oral history interview with Antonio Torres.
00:21
Please state your name and spell it out loud.
00:24
Okay, my name is Jose Antonio Torres.
00:28
Torres spelled, T, like in Thomas, O-R-R-E-S.
00:34
What is your birthdate and birthplace?
00:36
I was born in Viña del Mar on the coast of Chile in 1949.
00:44
With which ethnic or cultural backgrounds do you identify?
00:47
I’m a Latino.
00:50
When and where were you born?
00:52
What they’re backgrounds.
00:55
Oh.
00:56
You’re parents born, sorry.
00:58
My parents were born in Chile.
01:02
My father’s origin, I have no idea how far it goes back, I
01:09
guess a mixture of natives and
01:13
Spain, but we have no idea of his roots.
01:17
My mother is a more recent immigrant to Chile, so she came from Italy.
01:22
And so, I’m third generation from the Italy background.
01:29
Where did you grow up and where were you raised?
01:32
I was raised until finishing college in Chile.
01:39
I lived on the coast and attended German school, it was a full immersion program.
01:45
So my first language was mostly German.
01:51
The doors of the school were closed, and I was the guy who didn’t speak German.
01:57
So it was, right away, the feeling of being different from the rest was notable.
02:03
My family, nobody spoke German, so it was a little bit strange, but it was a
02:08
great school, nothing to say about that.
02:12
Then I went to school in Santiago where I attended Catholic University of Chile,
02:18
and I graduated with a bachelors in math first and then a second bachelors
02:26
in industrial and chemical Engineering.
02:31
Then there was a possibility of coming to the United States with the restriction
02:37
that I had to be in food science.
02:39
So I said, I don’t know anything about food science, I was a chemical engineer.
02:43
I had no idea what food science was all about, but I wanted to come to U.S. I had
02:49
been here as a kid with my parents, but I had no idea what it was to live in the
02:54
U.S. I mean, as a tourist, it’s not the same as living in a country, so I wanted
02:59
to live in the U.S. So I was fortunate to be accepted at MIT, so I went to
03:05
live in Boston where my family started.
03:09
I graduated from MIT first with a masters in Food Microbiology and
03:14
then a PhD in Food Engineering.
03:18
Who are your mentors, personal or professional?
03:22
I mean, my first mentor, and probably the most important mentor, was an
03:27
elementary professor, and he was a German.
03:33
He had a strong influence on my life because, first, he had a love for
03:40
science; his house was a museum, he collected stuff: minerals,
03:46
rocks, fauna, flora, everything.
03:51
It was fantastic experience just to go to his house and just see in this
03:55
museum where you could touch and play with anything that he had to show us.
04:01
You know, and some of those were brought also to the classroom.
04:03
So the science was there,
04:09
the discipline was there, obviously German discipline, it’s well
04:14
known for its effectiveness, okay.
04:18
But, most important was also his gentle transfer of the experience of war.
04:27
He had been on the Africa corps in Africa fighting in World War II and
04:34
later in the Russian front, which was even harsher than being on the
04:40
African desert and then, obviously, the final days in Germany for the war.
04:49
He was also very much a hippie.
04:51
I mean, if you had seen him when he was 50 or 60, he would be
04:58
hitchhiking in California trying to cross the U.S. by hitchhiking.
05:06
He was always exploring.
05:10
And one day he decided to go to the Amazons from Chile to Brazil,
05:18
just driving and getting into small villages, getting to know the natives,
05:23
how they were living originally, and getting in a lot of adventures.
05:28
So it went from, kind of what I learned was things like, I have a
05:32
horror for war, I cannot stand that, a love for science at an early age,
05:39
discipline because you’ve got to get organized, you got to do your thing.
05:43
I mean, it’s one thing saying you will do it, the other thing, you
05:46
need to get organized to get it done.
05:48
So, that was probably my strongest influence.
05:53
And then, I think that in my PhD program, I had another
05:59
person, kind of similar context.
06:03
He was a Jew who was born in what used to be Russia, or what used to be,
06:10
sorry, Poland and then became Russia.
06:14
Went also through the experience of going through part of the war thing.
06:21
And so, a little bit of that context of the horror of war, but also
06:30
what I learned from him was the love for being a faculty, right.
06:35
And being a faculty in the U.S. is totally different from being
06:39
a faculty anywhere in the world.
06:41
It’s very, very, very different, and we can talk about that if you want to.
06:46
Another thing I also learned from him, the love for writing; I love writing.
06:50
I have never written fictional, it’s always technical writing, but I do,
06:54
I really like writing and editing and I learned that from him too.
06:59
So probably those two are the most strongest influence in my professional
07:04
and personal life from a teacher
07:11
point of view.
07:11
Well, and let’s forget, also parents.
07:14
My parents, I mean, they were, they came from pretty humble backgrounds, and both
07:20
of them considered education was the most important investment they could ever make.
07:27
My father, for example, chose to live far away from home, he was never there
07:33
because he was a merchant marine, which was the only way he could make
07:36
enough money to pay for our good schooling that we were receiving.
07:44
The German school in which we were attending, me and my sisters, was private,
07:49
and, therefore, you had to pay tuition.
07:53
But, the combination of tuition, support from the German government,
07:58
plus support from the state, made for an incredible school experience.
08:04
If I can tell you just a few examples, I’m sure you have never heard that
08:09
this elementary school teacher I had, people had PhD in graphic arts, and
08:15
language, and physical education.
08:18
In elementary school system, I don’t think that you can find
08:21
that anywhere in the world.
08:22
I mean, it was an unique experience because we had that triple funding source.
08:27
A lot of Germans also had a horror for war, so instead of doing military
08:34
service, they elected to do social services, so a lot of the teachers
08:40
that we had were choosing doing social service rather than serving in the army.
08:45
That was a choice that was very popular in the sixties, seventies, and eighties.
08:50
I don’t know if it’s still valid in Germany yet, but it was the
08:54
experience of their time; they were choosing to do something good
08:57
instead of doing military service.
09:01
Very interesting.
09:03
Why did you decide to come to OSU?
09:06
When was that, and the year?
09:08
It was in 1984.
09:10
And the reason was a job.
09:14
I mean, the job description was exactly what I wanted.
09:17
I wanted to be a faculty and have the combination of requiring the unique skills
09:23
that I had acquired in my undergrad and then strengthening my doctoral program
09:31
in microbiology, which I have found to be essential to work with food.
09:37
For me, if you don’t solve microbiological programs in food, you have solved nothing.
09:43
Food would either spoil quickly, if you don’t, if you have microorganisms
09:48
there, they will grow there, they will get rotten, smell funny,
09:52
whatever, or it will kill you.
09:54
So, neither one are a very nice thing to do.
09:58
So, I liked that aspect.
10:00
Yeah.
10:01
What were your first impressions of the University, of the Corvallis community?
10:06
Well, it’s my parents that brought me to the U.S. as a kid to the East Coast.
10:15
I don’t know if you’ve traveled to the East Coast, but if you live in New York,
10:19
New York City, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, all the big cities of the East
10:24
Coast, you will think that farms are things that you go on vacation, they
10:29
are not part of real life because you live in cities, cities that never stop.
10:33
I mean, you drive from Boston to New York, and its housing never
10:38
stops; it’s always housing and then more houses and more houses.
10:42
The density reduces, but it’s always housing and housing and
10:46
housing, very urban environment.
10:49
So that was my image of the U.S., that this was just big city.
10:55
Well, I was totally wrong, this is a big farm—nothing else but a big farm.
11:00
So when I flew to the job interview, I flew into Eugene, and I had a
11:07
friend who had also graduated from MIT, was also a faculty at that time
11:12
here, so he picked me up from Eugene.
11:14
And we drive on 99 to Corvallis, and I saw sheep and cows, and I say,
11:19
“what the hell, where am I?” Okay.
11:22
It was, you can imagine the experience of coming from a big city and landing
11:30
in Eugene Airport and driving to Corvallis, which at the time had only
11:34
about 35,000 people, and this university probably had about 10, 12,000 students,
11:40
so it was very small and very rural.
11:46
When my family was over here, my kids went crazy about it.
11:52
They were like—my young boy, he was absolutely crazy seeing cowboys,
11:57
he was like, “Dad, cowboys! Cowboy
12:01
boots, oooh, cowboy boots. Cowboy belts.” A few months later, all he wanted to wear
12:08
was cowboy boots, cowboy hat, cowboy belt, and cowboy, everything was cowboy for him,
12:14
so it was a very different environment.
12:18
Did you like how it was different than what you thought it was going to be or…?
12:21
In the beginning, to be honest, I’m a city person.
12:24
I was born in a medium-size city, which now has grown to probably
12:32
about half a million to a million, surrounded by another city of about
12:37
the same size, so I was a city person.
12:40
Then I went to a school in Santiago, which is a five million city,
12:47
then I went to Boston to school, big city again.
12:51
So it was, I was not sure.
12:55
I liked the job, I was not sure about living in a small town.
13:00
So the beginning, I was not sure if I was gonna stay here or not forever; I was
13:05
thinking, maybe, I should go back East.
13:07
The main reason of going East, is that it’s easier to go to Chile where I’m from.
13:11
From here
13:14
it’s difficult to go to Chile.
13:14
So, in the beginning, I was not so sure, not so sure.
13:16
I was sure about the job, but not so sure about living a small
13:19
town, which I had not done before.
13:22
Right now, if I had to describe it to be honest, it’s kind of
13:26
a love - hate relationship.
13:28
I love the environment of being able to take my mountain bike
13:35
and do mountain biking, running in the forest, that’s great.
13:40
Taking only three minutes from home to work, fantastic, I mean, I love
13:44
that efficiency, the easy living.
13:47
This is easy living.
13:48
And when you live in a big city, life is a lot harder,
13:52
the daily life as a lot harder.
13:54
So, the compromise of being here and much more efficient, I have
14:00
more time free to do things I really like, which in my case is traveling.
14:05
I’m a traveler by definition.
14:07
I travel much more than you can think that I should’ve done as a faculty, probably.
14:15
I travel a lot.
14:16
That’s cool.
14:19
What is your current position?
14:21
I’m an Associate Professor of Food Processing Engineering.
14:25
Please describe your job duties.
14:29
My main duty as a faculty is to do research, but research not only for the
14:37
sake of research, but for the training of future researchers, future scientists.
14:44
I feel that the research is a tool to help them learn how to think
14:50
creatively, solve problems that are challenging, and get a new knowledge.
14:55
I mean, that’s what I think my main job is to have new students
15:00
that would be to do what I have been doing for the last 30 years.
15:05
The research is a tool.
15:07
But it’s exciting research; I enjoy every project that I work on.
15:13
There’ve been very few jobs, very few projects in which I have
15:16
not enjoyed every minute of it.
15:20
And one thing that I’ve managed to be able to do has been to marriage
15:27
this love for traveling with my work.
15:33
I strongly believe that
15:37
the more I interact with other people in other locations, I get
15:43
new ideas new, ways to see things.
15:46
I don’t like inbreeding when we start looking at our self here and we keep
15:51
talking to our self, keeping talking to our self even though you came from another
15:55
place, I mean 10, 15 years afterwards, you are one of these people here, and
16:00
you become the same as everybody else.
16:03
So, I want to get the opportunity to see the thinking of other people everywhere.
16:11
So, a lot of my research has collaborations that are international.
16:16
So, Mexico--obviously, I mean, it’s so close, I speak the language—Europe because
16:26
my German education, I had a strong connection to Germany, Spain because of
16:32
the language, I have a strong connection to that, and Chile because I was born
16:39
there, and now, I married a Chinese woman, so now, I host a lot of interest in
16:46
China, which, by chance, have been also a source of new projects and interactions.
16:52
So,
16:54
for example, I teach a graduate course in Mexico, and I just travel
17:00
on Thursday night, teach Friday afternoon and Saturday, and fly back
17:06
on Sunday, and I’m back at work.
17:09
So, as long as I’m
17:13
healthy enough to keep traveling, you will see me at the airport.
17:18
That’s cool.
17:18
Do you like doing that?
17:19
Oh I love it.
17:25
One of the things that I’ve the privilege is that in most jobs,
17:30
your boss will tell you where to travel; I choose where to travel.
17:37
And I choose to travel with people that I really like.
17:41
So, I mean, there are so many scientists in the world, why would you like to
17:45
work with someone you don’t like?
17:49
It is rare for me to spend much time in hotels, most of the time
17:53
I spend time with my friends.
17:55
Stay in their homes and we work and then we talk about other
18:01
things and do other things.
18:04
For example, one of my passions is biking, as I mentioned before.
18:10
And one of the most beautiful places to bike is Europe; there’s a lot of
18:16
trails where you can do wonderful biking, and one of the best is in Spain.
18:21
There’s a very old tradition that goes back to about 800 where people would
18:29
do pilgrimages to the north of Spain to a city called Santiago de Compostela.
18:36
And, probably it’s a myth, there’s a myth that Saint James, you
18:43
know, one of the apostles, the most important apostle to Jesus.
18:48
The myth is that he’s buried in this town.
18:52
So, people would travel from all over Europe to this
18:57
church to pray to Saint James,
19:04
okay.
19:04
It’s possibly invented for political reasons.
19:07
You know, the Muslims, the Moors, were coming from Africa, invading
19:12
Europe, and they made it into France.
19:15
And, obviously, they were pushing their Muslim belief, and the Christian
19:20
Kings of the North didn’t like that, they wanted to be Christian kings.
19:25
Therefore, for them, it was important they create a barrier
19:29
to this loss of their playground.
19:34
I mean, this is where they were the kings, and they wanted to keep it that way.
19:38
So, by sending about a million Pilgrims into northern Spain every year,
19:47
you created a tremendous barrier to further expansions of the Muslims.
19:54
Creating a very strong Catholic Church in Spain, stopped it and protected these
20:03
western Christians’ view of Europe.
20:07
It could have been different.
20:11
If the Moors could have gotten up all the way into Europe, then
20:14
we would all be praying to Allah today, if it had not been for that.
20:18
So, it’s an interesting.
20:19
So that traditional pilgrim still remains today.
20:23
I invite you to try it; it’s a very organized way of traveling by foot or
20:30
by bike in Europe because every small town, there’s a place where you can stay
20:37
for free or for no, close to no money.
20:40
And you will see pilgrims today from all over the world; I see people from Korea,
20:46
China, all over South America, a lot of Europe, and a few from the U.S. too.
20:56
Anyways, go ahead.
20:57
Uh, let’s see.
21:00
Please describe the types of classes that you teach, research you conduct, programs
21:04
you administer, services you provide.
21:08
Okay, so in terms of teaching, I’m responsible for two topics.
21:15
One is more descriptive than quantitative; it’s food packaging, all the technologies
21:22
that are used for food packaging.
21:25
And, a good friend of mine who works for a company in Albany, Oregon, Freeze
21:32
Dry that produces Mountain Health.
21:34
A lot of you like to go hiking, hiking food
21:40
is that packaging is very important.
21:44
Like for you, when you go outside when it’s cold and hot or raining
21:49
or snowing without clothing, that’s the same thing if you send food
21:56
into a market without a package.
21:59
It would not be very good for the food, it would not be very good for you to
22:02
go outside naked, not because it’s shameful, but because you’re gonna get
22:07
cold or you’re going to get burnt by sun or frostbite if it’s that cold.
22:13
Okay, so that’s one course.
22:16
The other course that I teach tries to give the students their
22:22
strength in quantitative views of our industry, the food industry,
22:29
how to solve quantitative problems.
22:32
When we say, for example, this food needs to be heated,
22:38
that doesn’t tell me anything.
22:39
I need to tell you what temperature and how long and how fast I need
22:45
to reach the temperature I said.
22:47
So, all those quantitative questions are engineering questions
22:50
that I try to teach my class.
22:54
And, in terms of research, there are multiple topics
23:00
I’ve covered in my experience.
23:03
But most of it has to do with solving some microorganism problem--either a spoilage
23:11
or a safety problem, microorganism safety.
23:15
So, we use a variety of technologies to control microorganisms.
23:19
Typically heat is
23:22
the most useful one, by heat you kill microorganisms; and the problem with heat
23:29
is that it kills microorganisms, which is good but it also changes the chemical
23:35
composition of food or it changes the flavor of food which is not so good.
23:40
And therefore, it’s always about how much can we do so that the quality of
23:44
food is still good while it’s also safe.
23:48
So, it’s always trying to find that optimum way you can have solve the
23:54
problem or reduce the risk to a minimal acceptable while, at the same time,
23:59
preserving the good quality of food.
24:03
We also use, look for new technologies.
24:07
And last ten years, I’ve worked a lot on the use of high pressure instead
24:14
of heat, so the advantage of using pressure is that—the reason that the
24:23
chemical composition of food changes by heat is that heat is so much energy
24:28
that it breaks the chemical bounds so the chemical nature of the food
24:32
changes because all the chemical bonds are destroyed by heat, okay.
24:38
The advantages of pressure is that it’s not so much energy,
24:43
and therefore, it cannot break covalent bonds so the chemical
24:46
nature of the food stays the same.
24:50
I can give you pressure treated orange juice and fresh squeezed orange juice and
24:55
you won’t be able to find the difference because it will taste the same, it will
25:00
have the same color, it will be minor changes, it will be difficult to detect.
25:06
Because
25:09
microorganisms is a very complicated organisms, they have a lot of structural
25:15
components, and those structural components can be destroyed by pressure.
25:19
So, I can kill microorganisms without changing the chemical nature of foods.
25:27
And there are a lot of products today on the market which it makes
25:29
it nice when you start working on something that doesn’t exist.
25:33
Because 15 years ago there was no pressure treated food, it was only just beginning
25:38
our research and this department was one of the initiators of pressure research
25:45
in ’93 when we started which was barely the beginning of this technology.
25:53
And today, we have products on the market, that’s nice.
25:59
Who has been important to you here at OSU in terms of your work and position?
26:05
Who’s been important to me…Actually, probably EOP has
26:09
been a source of a lot of my
26:16
colleagues that have been supportive.
26:21
So, Janet Nishihara is important to me--not only because she’s the
26:25
instructor of this course, but she’s been a good friend for a long time.
26:32
Another friend from the same department, Dr. [name unintelligible] which
26:36
was a partner in the scholarship that we can talk about later.
26:46
But, unfortunately she passed away a few years ago.
26:49
So,
26:52
colleagues have been important.
26:59
Two
27:02
places that have been really important for me has been Valley Library; I
27:08
find that is a wonderful place in terms of the environment, particularly
27:15
with this new structure—it’s new for me because the old one was totally
27:19
different—but since 2001, the Valley Library is a fantastic place to be.
27:27
And Dixon, Dixon Recreation Center for me is the other place that is very special.
27:35
And its special, one because the infrastructure has been well designed.
27:41
An architect will tell you how important is the design for how
27:45
you feel in that certain location.
27:47
For example, this place, I’ve tried my best to make it friendly, okay.
27:53
I just, it’s a box—and these windows are not very attractive, and the
27:57
street outside is terrible, right?
27:59
So, there’s not much you can do with this thing, but when you do some good
28:04
architectural design, they are better.
28:06
And this what happens in Valley Library and Dixon--have been good
28:10
architectural designs working on them.
28:14
The other thing is the staff.
28:16
I mean, most of them are students.
28:18
And there’s good training there because the quality of interaction
28:23
that the students do with the people that they serve, it’s fantastic.
28:28
If you ever work there, congratulations.
28:34
Those are the ones that can come to my mind.
28:40
Most of—most my collaborations
28:45
or support have been coming from outside the university because of my nature of
28:50
trying to seek this international network.
28:55
And my students, I shouldn’t forget my students.
28:58
When I say my students I’m talking about my graduate students; they are like—it’s
29:02
like, you know, you’re exploring and you can be the head of the exploration team
29:08
but you better have good relationship with the team because when you are in
29:15
a no place land when you don’t have no idea what’s going to happen, having
29:19
the support of your team is important.
29:22
My students have been very
29:26
supportive.
29:26
How have you seen the OSU, and just the community of Corvallis, change over
29:32
the 30 years that you’ve been here.
29:34
Oh yeah.
29:38
First of all, the color has change.
29:42
Earlier,
29:45
when I went to register my kids in Hoover elementary school,
29:52
the first impression was the statistics.
29:57
When they said that you will be here the diversity in the school, I said I don’t
30:03
want to be anything, I just want to bring school to kids, my kids to the school.
30:09
But they said there was 99.7, 99.8 percent white.
30:13
There were other schools with a little bit more, but Hoover school was in the
30:19
North of Corvallis was very, very white.
30:23
And the other thing also, was
30:29
there was a strong rejection for people that were not white.
30:34
I was shocked to hear questions like,
30:40
“When are you leaving?
30:44
When are you going back?” And, I couldn’t understand it because probably
30:49
you—I should give you a context.
30:52
There are many jobs that you can have in this country, right.
30:58
All of them have one thing in common, great mobility, you’ll be
31:02
moving from job place to place, company to company--not faculty.
31:08
Faculty jobs are the most stable jobs there can be.
31:12
So, having a faculty job, and knowing that in Hoover school there were
31:17
so many of the faculty that are new faculty, that also stable jobs, why
31:23
was I being asked when I was leaving?
31:25
That didn’t feel quite right.
31:28
Or when my kids were
31:35
told by the parents of other kids that they shouldn’t play with their kids
31:42
because their language would be, their way of talking English would be damaged, okay.
31:49
My kids were born in the U.S., they speak like a gringo, okay.
31:53
They went to from preschool--from childcare, preschool, kindergarten,
32:02
all through college in the U.S.—they speak like gringos.
32:08
So, I couldn’t understand.
32:11
Some parents, when they would find out they were not born in the U.S.,
32:16
their kid would stop coming from our home—it was a bit strange.
32:22
That was very discouraging to say the least.
32:28
I think that has changed; there’s much more acceptance of diversity today.
32:36
There have been a lot of efforts by the community, in particular the
32:43
university and some companies, when--for example when Hewlett Packard was a
32:49
much stronger employer in this city.
32:53
I mean, what you see of Hewlett Packard today is nothing to what it was ten
32:58
years ago, I mean probably it was five times larger than today, that’s huge.
33:04
And,
33:06
they had a lot of Indian foreign engineers, foreign scientists that
33:10
came from, originally from India.
33:13
And every time they brought one of their employees with an Indian
33:17
background, he wouldn’t last here more than three or six months and the guy
33:21
would, or the woman, would just quit.
33:24
And they were desperate because they needed this skill and they
33:30
brought this skill over here and then the guy would disappear.
33:32
What
33:35
I heard that Hewlett Packard had to do was bring a bunch of the same background,
33:42
so suddenly we had a lot of people from India working for HP in town because you
33:48
had, you need a certain mass, I need to have people like me to whom I can talk to.
33:54
So at the beginning, it was very hard because I didn’t
33:56
have any to—recent hires at
34:03
OSU, several new faculty actually from, not only from
34:08
Latino, but actually from Chile.
34:10
For me, have been very great to be able to talk about common
34:15
things that we can share.
34:17
I mean, I thought if we don’t share anything it’s difficult to
34:21
have conversation which leads to friendship and leads to relationship.
34:27
At the beginning, when you don’t know each other, you need to have
34:32
something in common so you can have a seed in which something can grow.
34:37
The reverse is it takes a lot of effort.
34:40
So, being an immigrant takes a lot of effort because you come
34:44
from totally different background.
34:46
Are there any events or programs that stand out to you that either
34:53
helped diversify Oregon State throughout the 30 years or kept
34:57
Oregon State from diversifying, kind of held it back a little bit?
35:02
I mean, the most important one for diversity has been the cultural centers.
35:09
I mean, there’s no question that the cultural center have
35:12
made a big, big difference.
35:15
They have been grown to have an even a larger impact within all the
35:21
new infrastructures that have been built or within the construction.
35:26
Again, because you need to have a place where you can go that you will
35:32
find people with that common thing that allow you to survive, okay.
35:39
So that has been very important.
35:43
I have to recognize that, in recent years, I have not participated very
35:46
much there, but there was a time where I was, every week, in the cultural
35:52
center doing things over there.
35:56
My daughter, for example, was the coordinator for the cultural
36:00
center for two or three years.
36:02
And that happens for one reason; because she, when she was a little girl, when
36:07
we first came over here, we started going to a cultural center; so for her,
36:11
a cultural center was a natural place to be in, therefore later on to be
36:19
a leader there.
36:19
Things that held back—perceptions that are negative.
36:27
There is always this perception that…
36:34
[break]
36:35
What do you see as Oregon State University’s role in for supporting
36:40
faculty or students of color?
36:45
The most important thing to remember--this role for the host.
36:51
I mean, if I invite you home, I’m the host.
36:56
And if I want you to come to my home, I need to make it comfortable for you
37:02
and I need to make it welcome to you to come to my home, otherwise I can invite
37:09
you, but you’re not going to come to my home--I said, I don’t like that place, I
37:13
get treated badly, why should I go there?
37:15
You’re not going to go.
37:16
So that’s the role of OSU, it’s an infrastructure, it’s an organization,
37:24
it’s like being a good host, okay.
37:36
The problem that this is an organization with a lot of hosts at different levels.
37:43
I mean, we can have a campus president at the top level saying wonderful
37:48
things, but then each individual student eventually goes to a classroom.
37:53
And there are cases when teacher faculty eventually faces a department
37:59
head, etc. etc. etc. So, there are many hosts and I would say there’s still
38:06
a lot of work to be done to make all hosts understand that they have a role.
38:12
And that goes into my next question.
38:13
What suggestions would you have for OSU, I guess, to be better
38:17
hosts for these people of color?
38:25
First of all, there has to be a recognition for being good hosts.
38:29
There has to be part of the assessment of all the different leaders that
38:37
we have from the instructors and the teaching assistants to department
38:41
heads, the deans, blah blah blah.
38:42
They all need to be recognized when they’re doing a good job—there are
38:47
many on campus that do a fantastic job at being a good host, but
38:53
they are not being recognized.
38:55
So, I would say recognize them.
38:57
I would forgo punishing, I would go recognizing.
39:02
I think that if you recognize, people will say, “Wait a minute I’m not getting
39:06
recognized, what’s going on here?” Eventually people will change—some of
39:12
the people will never change, okay.
39:15
I always remember that there’s only one person you can be sure of that
39:19
you can change, and that’s yourself.
39:21
The rest, good luck.
39:27
What would you, or if you have anything to say, on the season that Oregon
39:30
State is currently in and where do you think this university is heading?
39:36
This city?
39:37
Yeah, the campus of Oregon State or just the city of Corvallis.
39:42
Okay.
39:42
I
39:45
mean, obviously OSU has grown tremendously in the last ten years;
39:52
I mean, it’s been amazing to see.
39:55
At the same time, I think we’re reaching the limit on how much we can grow.
40:00
I think it’s—everybody’s realizing that if we grow more, we’ll have to change
40:08
the city, and I’m not sure there’s a need or whether I want to do that.
40:16
I would need to be convinced that it’s worth the effort of changing the city.
40:23
I think that we’ve had a lot of underutilized spaces, a lot of
40:28
underutilized facilities, and a lot of underutilized resources,
40:32
but now, we, I would say, it’s the opposite—we have over-utilized
40:34
our resources and its getting very difficult to work on this campus.
40:41
Last year, for example, I had one day that there was electrical shutdown,
40:46
only one building was effected on the campus—this one, where I was teaching.
40:51
I could not teach my class.
40:52
I couldn’t find an empty classroom on an entire campus.
40:56
And I said, I don’t care where, just tell me where I can go—there was none.
41:00
That’s too much of utilization.
41:03
You must—things will always fail, you must have some spare
41:07
because things will always fail.
41:12
The—on of the things that OSU could do to make it more welcome—I
41:22
mean, obviously, the diversity of this country will keep going.
41:29
Immigrants will flow into this country like never have happened in the past;
41:37
I mean, it’s impossible to stop.
41:40
I think that this century is gonna, we’re gonna see much more migration than
41:45
we saw last century, for many reasons.
41:50
First of all, communications.
41:53
I mean, people see what this look like, what you can do, traveling
41:58
become a lot easier, so people will travel and they will see.
42:04
And a lot of countries overseas are doing well, they will have the means
42:09
to travel, and they will see, they will meet people here, they will fall in
42:14
love, and or they will like this place.
42:16
But, for many reasons, there will be more migration, so the
42:22
diversity will get worse and worse.
42:26
I’ve been in Europe a lot, and one of the things I like in Europe is
42:31
the acceptance of multiple languages.
42:34
In the East by people, accept and learn other languages.
42:40
Unfortunately the U.S. being lazy and we only speak English, and that’s a problem.
42:46
I think that with the language—when you learn a language, particularly when
42:50
you learn a language well, you also get the culture behind that language
42:54
and there’s a lot of value in that.
42:58
I was fortunate is that I went to a full-immersion German program, and even
43:05
though I don’t look like German at all, when I go to Germany, I feel it, okay.
43:12
And there are certain things that I like about Germany, for example, I always tell
43:17
my friends that what I like the Germans, is they’re always singing—Germans sing,
43:22
they are constantly singing, I like that.
43:25
They’re constantly walking, they like walking—a lot of things
43:29
that you learn from the language.
43:32
What else?
43:34
Going back to what you said about how being a faculty member here is
43:38
different than being a faculty member overseas somewhere, do you want to
43:42
expand a little bit more on that?
43:46
The relationship between students and faculty is much more friendly, it’s
43:53
a—there’s a, in most countries, you have a very structural organization,
43:57
you have the super professors, the assistant professor, the assistant to
43:57
the assistant—very structured, okay.
44:10
And you never see the super professor.
44:13
Here, you can go to a class and have a conversation with the best professor on
44:20
campus and he will teach you the same way.
44:24
The other thing, the other thing that’s also very different is that when
44:28
you become a professor here, and you begin as an assistant professor, which
44:33
is the first rank, you have almost the same power as a full professor.
44:40
You have the same privileges, the same obligations—you’ve got to get
44:43
funding, you got to teach classes, you supervise graduate students, and
44:48
you decide what are you going to do a research to do your work, okay.
44:53
And that’s very important because most PhD will finish 26, 27, 28—most of
45:04
them, that’s the age when they finish.
45:08
That’s the age where you still are changing, okay.
45:13
By 31 you become an established person, your personality will become—you’re
45:18
still growing and so when you become an assistant professor, you are still
45:24
growing, you are full of energy, full of an idea, full of innovation, and you grow.
45:30
And, you cannot do that in other countries.
45:32
So, in other countries, you become an established professor when you’re 45—it’s
45:37
too late, you’re old, you didn’t have the chance to bloom and get all the rules
45:44
and the branches as you could’ve had.
45:46
That’s very sad to see a lot of faculty that burn out before they start their
45:52
careers because they’ve been squeezed and not given any rights or privileges
45:58
to exercise what is a wonderful job.
46:01
I mean, this job of teaching others, it’s wonderful.
46:07
I mean, I’m helping to create the next generation, that’s a beautiful job.
46:13
And I work with people, what’s more beautiful thing than people?
46:18
I mean, it’s much more beautiful than this computer or a car or this
46:20
desk—a person is a beautiful thing.
46:24
So, that’s why you have to have people that have not
46:30
been destroyed by the system.
46:32
And then you also mentioned how you go down to Mexico and teach
46:36
that graduate student course, are you currently doing that now?
46:40
I do that one in one term, the winter term.
46:42
You’re doing it winter term?
46:43
Alright.
46:44
And the rest of the year, I have PhD students and other graduate
46:49
students that work with me and I go on there on a less-frequently basis.
46:52
But, in the winter term, I go every two week or every week.
46:57
And when you’re down there, are there things down at that university that you
47:00
see that you enjoy down there that you wish you could bring back to Oregon State?
47:05
Yeah.
47:05
One thing is that—this is, I’m sorry this is going to be a
47:10
complaint about our students,
47:14
for some good reasons, and some—not good—some valid reasons.
47:18
When I say to a student, one day I’m coming next Wed—next weekend, and
47:25
I’m going to be teaching on Saturday between nine and one o’clock, then
47:31
want to go for lunch together, and want to work from three to seven, and
47:36
then afterwards want to go for a beer?
47:39
So, there’s a lot of informality in that relationship, but also a lot
47:45
of flexibility upon the students.
47:49
They appreciate the effort of their faculty, they go over there, and
47:54
they say, whatever time you want to teach, I’ll be there, okay.
48:00
If I tried to do the joke over here, I would have revolution, okay.
48:05
They would say, “Oh I cannot do it on Saturday, I already have plan, and not
48:09
only plans”… and sometimes, yeah, you have a job, I understand that. That’s
48:17
an unfortunate reality of how costly U.S. education has become, I think that, yeah.
48:24
It’s too costly; it should be a lot less costly.
48:28
Then we can talk about the many reasons why it could be less costly, beginning
48:33
with books—I find it ridiculous.
48:35
I mean, at my class in food packaging, I want to use a book, it’s a wonderful book.
48:42
The last time that I checked, which was about eight, ten years ago, it was $360.
48:47
I mean, how can I ask a student to buy a $360 book?
48:51
Eight years ago, which today is probably $450, I thought, I cannot do it.
48:59
Are there any experiences that you’ve had--maybe with students, as you said
49:03
that in the U.S. it’s a little more informal—experiences of, like, one-on-one
49:07
time with students where you’ve really—or, they’ve helped you grow in your experience
49:11
here at Oregon State, or you’ve helped them grow that you really enjoyed that?
49:15
Yeah.
49:15
I mean, one
49:20
experience that I came from sabbatical in industry, that was, kind of,
49:25
the initial conception of the idea.
49:27
I went on sabbatical in ’93 to Kraft foods in Chicago.
49:33
They have a big research center North, Northwest of Chicago and had the privilege
49:40
to work there for a year and a half.
49:43
And one of the—there was one idea that was always in all the discussion
49:52
we had was because of leverage.
49:55
If you have a little bit, you have leverage to get more, okay.
50:00
So they said if you have 50,000, you said 50,000 to get 100,000.
50:09
So I said, I’m going to try to establish a scholarship program for
50:16
students of diversity, but I know that I will never have enough money
50:23
to make it an important program.
50:27
And, the other thing they also said, I want it to be visible.
50:34
I said, how can I make something because I was just a single person with a
50:38
couple of people from EOP, from Fishes and Wildlife, a few colleagues that
50:42
we’re working with—maybe six people?
50:45
How can we make something that would have an impact?
50:48
And then we came with an idea—first of all, to focus on
50:53
students with leadership skills.
50:54
I said, because student leaders are visible, so just by
50:59
choosing student leaders, our program will be visible, okay.
51:06
And the other thing we said, we’re going to negotiate, we’re going
51:12
to get some funding and with that funding in hand, we’re going to
51:15
negotiate to get more funding.
51:18
And so, we got a grant from USDA to recruit students, and
51:24
we got less than a $100,000.
51:29
And, with that money, we started negotiating with Food science,
51:34
EOP, Housing, Fishes and Wildlife, Horticulture, Animal
51:40
Science, what else negotiators.
51:43
And we said, give us something.
51:47
So from Housing we got, for example, some free housing.
51:51
So, there’s always a free room somewhere, so they said, we’ll give you free
51:56
housing so you can offer the students a scholarship in the form of free housing.
52:02
And from the different departments, they all chipped in money.
52:09
And we recruited about 26-30 students through the scholarship program.
52:16
And our target was every organization that we could get into and become,
52:25
one of our students become a leader of that institution, of
52:27
that organization, we will attempt.
52:30
And I was proud that we got the first black female as association
52:38
of OSU students president, was one of the students from the
52:42
program — Melanie Spraggins.
52:44
And so, we had the visibility.
52:48
All students were of high risk because—and we lost a few.
52:54
We lost one, for example, who was very promising, and we couldn’t understand why
53:00
he was having so many financial problems.
53:03
All his scholarship money he was sending back home.
53:06
So, after a term we had to say, “We’re sorry, I mean, you cannot do that, we have
53:12
to drop you.” But, except for a few—that was the only one we dropped—everybody
53:21
graduated, most people went to either law school, medical school, or graduate
53:27
school, or business school afterwards. I said, one of them just called me this
53:34
summer and said that he finished with an electrical engineering degree, and now
53:41
he’ll be working for Motorola for a while.
53:44
And he took some food science courses, in particularly a lot of chemistry
53:49
courses, which is not typical in an electrical engineering program.
53:52
Are you electrical engineering?
53:54
No, but I’m a chemistry.
53:54
Okay.
53:56
No, there’s no chemistry there, okay.
53:58
And he said that Motorola, they found his chemistry background was very
54:03
important when litigating patents.
54:08
So Motorola is now paying him to go to law school to get his law degree so
54:14
that he can become a patent attorney.
54:17
So, you never, there was--never expected it to happen.
54:21
Or, I had another--twins, they were twin students, both
54:28
electrical engineer students.
54:30
And they come to me one day and said, “I need a letter of recommendation,”
54:34
and he said, “Me too.” And I look at them, I said, these two guys,
54:38
they have the same background.
54:42
And they said, we’re applying for the Millennium Gate scholarship.
54:47
And, I don’t know if you heard about that one, but that’s a dream of a
54:50
scholarship; it pays everything, everything—books, travel to meetings,
54:55
computer, graduate school until you finish whatever you decide.
55:01
So, once you get it, you can get a PhD fully supported, okay.
55:06
So both of them, come to me, they’re both strong students,
55:09
both great soccer players, great student leaders, they look the same.
55:15
How can I write two letters that are different at the same time?
55:20
Both got the same chance, both them got the scholarship.
55:25
So and, both them went to grad school—Stanford, and etc. So, those
55:31
are the pleasure of working with any student who has enough motivation
55:37
to go beyond just the classroom.
55:40
And, those kids were everywhere--were playing soccer, great players,
55:49
students organizations, doing well in school, it takes an effort.
55:56
And they both come from a family of seven kids; both parents were immigrants.
56:02
So immigrants going back and forth to Mexico and still were
56:06
able to get seven kids through schools, all of them through OSU.
56:12
Incredible.
56:14
What would you say are some of your greatest accomplishments?
56:19
Greatest accomplishments, wow.
56:22
My students.
56:24
My students, I mean, there’s no question that my greatest
56:29
accomplishment is students.
56:30
I mean, for example, I had a recent PhD from my group, he went back to Chile.
56:39
He was, he—his parents got a PhD in, at OSU in forestry.
56:46
So he had grown, lived in as a kid, going to elementary schools here in Corvallis.
56:52
So, his dream was to come back to Corvallis and get his own PhD.
56:58
He did.
56:59
He was being stolen by my home university in Chile, and his current
57:06
university fought back, and offered him more because he’s incredibly good.
57:14
He has told me this week, he got a, close to a million dollar to stay.
57:24
Okay, so they said, “We’ll build you a lab, everything you want, we’ll
57:28
give you this, we’ll give you, but you have to stay.” That’s great to see.
57:34
So, when they’re so successful, it’s great to see.
57:37
Or my first PhD student, who was a Chinese, and I knew he was
57:48
the best to be a faculty.
57:50
And went back to see him in China two years ago, and he was
57:56
department head, he’d done a wonderful career as department head.
57:59
He was the same person.
58:01
And I had—the second was also a Chinese, but he was a business guy.
58:08
Although he did a PhD, he was a business person.
58:11
I knew it from the beginning.
58:12
And I went to visit him too, and he and his brother had built two very successful
58:22
biotechnology companies in China.
58:25
So, those are things that say, yeah, I did okay, I did okay.
58:30
I mean, their success is what makes you feel good, makes it worthwhile working
58:34
here ‘til late so that they can finish.
58:38
And, you know, as I said, the key is to motivate them while, at the same
58:45
time, not to quench their dreams.
58:48
So, don’t squeeze them; let them bloom, and kids will do incredible things.
58:55
I mean, my two current PhDs that I’m talking about right now, the
58:59
work that I’m working here on the computer, one of them has a crazy idea.
59:04
She’s from Thailand, and I had a crazy idea that’s send her
59:08
to Spain for a year and a half.
59:10
I had a project with a colleague over there, and we needed one student.
59:14
And I said, “You want to go?” “I don’t speak Spanish.” “It’s okay,
59:18
just go.” And she went, okay.
59:21
So, it—one thing is important, they have my--I’ve gained their confidence
59:26
that I’m crazy but probably they will be okay to do the greater thing they do.
59:31
And the other Chinese student that came to me one day and said, “You know, you have
59:35
all these connections in Latin America, I want to have an experience in Latin
59:39
America.” So, I sent him to Chile for one whole year, okay. And finished two
59:46
publications, he did okay. It’s a lot of fun; he knows more of Chile than I know.
59:52
He went to Easter Island which is part of Chile, went to the desert
59:57
in the North, went to the South.
59:59
So, he did great.
1:00:02
He didn’t want to come back from Chile, okay.
1:00:07
And did, at the same time, his work—he did what he was expected.
1:00:11
So,
1:00:14
students are the most satisfactory part of the equation.
1:00:18
Is there anything else you’d like to discuss at or talk
1:00:21
about in these last minutes?
1:00:25
I think that also my kids.
1:00:28
I mean, that’s a—if
1:00:32
you want to go to a Beaver home, choose any of my kids,
1:00:37
it’s Beaver all over the place.
1:00:38
I really like how much they have learned to love OSU.
1:00:45
And, both of them are doing great professionally, and their
1:00:53
support for OSU is unquestionable.
1:00:57
My daughter, she works in Anheuser-Busch in Virginia, Williamsburg.
1:01:02
She’s three or four times a year here, she manages somehow to come over here.
1:01:09
And now that she’s a recruiter for Anheuser-Busch, her first
1:01:14
mission is to get another Beaver working for her company.
1:01:19
So,
1:01:24
I like that.
1:01:24
Anything else?
1:01:24
No, that should be it.
1:01:25
Thank you.
1:01:26
It was fun.
