00:01
My name is Lyndi Petty and I will be conducting this oral
00:03
history for my undergraduate thesis at Oregon State University.
00:07
Today is May 3oth, 2017 and the time is 2:50 p.m. Our
00:14
interviewee will introduce herself.
00:16
Hi!
00:16
I’m Jasmine Armas, and I am a fourth year studying zoology.
00:22
So, to begin, I’m going to ask you a little bit about your childhood.
00:27
So, where were you born and raised, and what was it like growing up there?
00:31
So, I was born and raised in Los Angeles County.
00:36
Different cities, but the most,
00:39
the one that my grandparents moved to was Maywood, California, and then my
00:44
mom moved us to Lakewood, California, a few years into my elementary school.
00:50
So, I regularly visited back in Maywood, California, so I
00:55
still consider that my hometown.
00:56
It was predominately, a predominantly Latinx community, with about
01:01
97% being Latinx identifying.
01:06
And so, it was just very homey, I would say.
01:13
It was just, I grew up with a lot of family because we all lived in houses
01:19
that were across the streets from each other and they were multi-family
01:23
homes, so I lived with my cousins.
01:25
And, my cousins were my best friends.
01:30
Describe the, I mean you already mentioned this, but describe
01:32
the community you grew up.
01:33
How did your community shape you as a person?
01:36
So, as I mentioned, my cousins were my best friends.
01:40
They’re the ones I went to school with, I regularly saw every day.
01:44
And when I was growing up in Maywood.
01:46
And when I moved to Lakewood, it was on a weekly basis.
01:49
So, I would say that I grew up really needing that family
01:56
aspect in every facet of my life.
01:58
And, I got it at school through sports, through band, through
02:05
different organizations that I met.
02:07
They always filled a kind of second family role when I was away from home.
02:12
So, I think my family was very, made sure to take care of each
02:17
other, and our community made sure to take care of each other.
02:20
And I’m not going to say there weren’t toxic behaviors, and things like that,
02:24
in my community, but it was always trying to take care of each other.
02:30
Nice!
02:31
And is that something you feel you carry through in the work that you do and….
02:39
[laughs]
02:39
? Yeah!
02:40
I would say that!
02:41
Behind me is a quote, my favorite quote, by an activist named Harsha Walia,
02:47
“Be as loving to each other as we are dangerous to the system,” so really
02:51
tying that community aspect is essential to resisting systems of oppression.
02:58
Thank you, so now I’m going to ask you some questions about your time at
03:03
Oregon State, including the Speak Out.
03:06
So why did you choose to come to OSU?
03:09
So, I am a first-generation student.
03:12
And so, I went to a high school in a wealthy area that did try its
03:18
best to prepare me for college.
03:20
But I still didn’t have a lot of knowledge about it, outside of the internet and
03:25
what my teachers were pushing me towards.
03:29
They were pushing us towards University of California schools, so UC schools,
03:33
and Ivy league schools, which is not a route that I really wanted.
03:40
And so I chose Oregon State, actually, because I missed the application for all
03:48
California State schools and I thought that I needed to go to school immediately
03:53
after high school and I didn’t want to “get behind” or whatever, so I was looking
03:59
at schools out of state. And I actually chose Oregon State because of their menu,
04:05
like their food menu, and their zoology program because I’m vegan so I had to
04:09
make sure that I could eat on campus.
04:11
So yeah, that's essentially why I chose Oregon state, because they had a
04:16
zoology program, they had a vet school that I could look at, and they had
04:23
food.
04:23
[laughs]
04:23
[laughs] Food is essential!
04:25
So what was your first impression of OSU once you arrived?
04:29
My first impression was not the most all-encompassing of OSU because I
04:35
came in through Luis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation [LSAMP]
04:38
, so minorities in the STEM field.
04:42
So, we did two weeks together, or about a week together, where we toured
04:48
the campus with other folks who were people of color or women in STEM.
04:54
And so, we toured the campus; we did a lot together.
04:59
We spoke to the faculty.
05:00
They tried to get us into the research immediately.
05:03
But like all my friends, so all my friends when in Los Angeles when I was
05:08
down there were people of color most often, because it was pretty diverse.
05:14
And then here, I came in with that group of people and I
05:18
assumed that it would be diverse.
05:19
Cause I didn't pay attention to, I didn't really, when I saw 70 percent
05:24
of the population was white, it didn’t really click in my head what
05:27
that really meant until move-in day.
05:29
And move-in day was the first, it was such a cultural shock.
05:33
I had never seen so many white people in my life before.
05:35
So that was shocking.
05:38
And then just to ground myself and to remind myself who I was, because people
05:46
stare, I just always had my headphones in and I was always playing Spanish
05:53
music, and just minding my own business.
05:55
It
05:57
was an interesting transition.
06:02
So what organization did you get involved
06:07
in after you arrived at OSU?
06:09
You mentioned you were LSAMP?
06:13
And then, what led you to be involved with those organizations?
06:16
So LSAMP was actually, I was recruited when I was applying to OSU.
06:24
I think that's actually one of the reasons I chose OSU because I got flyers and
06:32
stuff in the mail from the LSAMP program and I was like, “Oh, I should apply to
06:38
OSU then.” That helped me with the science portion of it and making connections
06:43
with professors and students in the same field that I’m in. Aside from that,
06:49
I’m really big on, I was really big on environmentalism before I came to Oregon
06:55
state, so I joined the Waste Watchers, which is a group on campus that focuses
07:01
on education around waste reduction.
07:05
And
07:08
I learned a lot through that organization, but I ultimately
07:10
left it just because it was very
07:16
centered around, I guess, the majority of the people in there were white and
07:22
it was centered around, I guess, a white experience with environmentalism.
07:26
That was not something I could connect with, or international
07:28
students who came to try to join the organization couldn’t connect with.
07:32
So I ultimately left after a term of really being involved and then at the
07:39
end of the year move out, that was the last, I think, big thing I did.
07:44
And I did Repair Fairs, where we sewed; I helped sew things back together
07:51
and then I did demos, like DIY stuff.
07:55
And then outside of those organizations I didn’t really get involved
07:58
with organizations per say, but I got involved with departments.
08:02
My roommate, she was hired for the black, the Lonnie B. Harris Black Cultural
08:07
Center, and so I spent a lot of time there, and that's how I ultimately
08:12
got involved with Racial Aikido, which is an amazing social justice retreat.
08:18
And from that, I ended up getting involved and getting hired at
08:23
the Cento Cultural César Chávez.
08:25
So most of my involvement has not been through student run
08:28
organizations but departments
08:33
on campus.
08:34
And now, do you still work for the Four C’s [Cento Cultural César Chávez]
08:38
? No.
08:38
So I did four years at the Cento Cultural César Chávez and I did one year as a
08:44
social, or, a dialogue educator for the Social Change Leadership programs.
08:52
And right now, I'm working as a Peer Advisor for Student
08:55
Leadership and Involvement.
08:57
So, it’s ultimately club support and
09:01
that stuff, yeah.
09:03
Awesome!
09:04
Sounds like you’ve been really busy during college
09:09
[laughs]
09:09
. So, is there anything else that you'd like to touch on about being involved
09:14
in clubs or with your organizations?
09:17
Oh!
09:18
I, so, I’m also, my first year I joined Kappa Delta Chi Sorority incorporated,
09:22
which is a Latina founded organization.
09:24
And through that I got involved with the unified Greek council.
09:29
So, that’s the all-encompassing council for six multicultural
09:35
organizations on campus.
09:36
So I would say those are the ones that I got predominantly, mostly
09:40
involved with outside of work.
09:43
And I do want to mention that the Social Change Leadership Programs position, our
09:48
department was specifically tailored and made to keep Miguel Arellano, who was
09:53
the GTA for the Centro for two years.
09:58
He was graduating and leaving OSU, and to keep him here, on campus
10:03
and still working here, they created an entirely new position.
10:06
And so that first year of Social Change Leadership
10:09
Programs was the 2014-2015 year,
10:15
it was him just getting
10:19
really trying to really narrow down what specific focus of the department was.
10:23
And the second year was when me, Jesseanne, and Haniya
10:26
got hired for the position.
10:29
And so that was the first year they had students in the position and then the
10:35
last year, because they ended the program after, after we worked there last year.
10:43
Sad,
10:46
but awesome that you were so involved.
10:48
So,
10:51
while you were working for the Social Change Leadership Programs
10:58
is when you also organized the Speak Out.
11:01
So how did you become involved with organizing of the Speak Out, and why
11:05
was it important for you to create a platform for students of color to
11:09
voice their concerns and experiences?
11:11
So
11:13
one of the biggest things about the Speak Out that we were supposed to
11:17
distance ourselves from was our position as a dialogue educator and not, that
11:25
the Speak Out wasn’t organized because
11:32
our jobs, our student jobs.
11:34
But I think the only way that we would have organized the Speak Out,
11:39
is the only reason that the Speak Out came to exist the way it did was
11:43
because me, Jesseanne, and Haniya were hired together in this department.
11:49
Because that’s how I got to know Jesseanne, and Jesseanne was the
11:52
person that did come to me and Haniya after a meeting, really upset about
12:03
OSU not responding to students of color’s concerns.
12:07
And then that with the activism happening on other campuses, that was started
12:15
by the activism in Mizzou [University of Missouri] , all of that really
12:20
tied together and helped us put on the student of color Speak Out, yeah.
12:29
So, was there a specific catalyst moment that sparked the Speak Out?
12:37
I think the catalyst moment was just
12:41
Jesseanne getting together with me and Haniya and us being like, well them
12:46
primarily, being like, “This is not okay.
12:51
Just, the apathy from OSU is not okay, and we need to do something
12:55
about it.” I think, I would say that was the catalyst moment, just us
13:01
deciding, “We’re going to do this” and then organizing it within a week.
13:09
That’s impressive!
13:11
Seriously, I did not know it was a week.
13:13
I thought it was months.
13:16
So, what were your overall goals of the Speak Out, and
13:19
what did you hope to achieve?
13:21
So, I don’t have our list of demands from the university, which
13:25
I was trying to look up earlier.
13:28
For me, the ultimate goals was giving students of color a voice and
13:34
just shaking up the administration.
13:38
I am not a fan of institutions, and so just
13:47
the student of color Speak Out really threatened OSU’s marketability.
13:54
And I wanted to see them actually do something about students' concerns
14:01
on campus, and if that meant threatening their marketability,
14:04
then that was what we needed to do.
14:06
So I really wanted it to be a point and catalyst for Oregon State to actually
14:17
act on what it speaks it does.
14:21
So that's primarily what was my goal, outside of giving students of color the
14:27
space they needed to talk about their concerns and address the climate of
14:34
racism and white supremacy on campus.
14:37
So, there was really two primary goals, was the, providing a platform and then
14:43
also really sticking OSU to their word?
14:46
Mmhmm [in the affirmative]
14:47
Okay, awesome.
14:50
So, describe the process of organizing the Speak Out.
14:53
How long did it take?
14:54
Well we alluded to that.
14:56
Were there any challenges that arose in planning the Speak Out?
15:00
Yeah, so it took a week.
15:02
I remember, I think, I’m pretty sure we started, actually started
15:06
on a Tuesday and then the Speak Out was the following Monday.
15:11
So,
15:15
I would say there were a lot of challenges.
15:17
The primary one being the department, the departments we were working for
15:22
did not want to be associated with our Speak Out, Student of Color Speak Out.
15:26
And so they really
15:31
hounded down on us about not talking, even saying the word, I feel like,
15:38
about organizing a Speak Out while we were in the office working.
15:44
So
15:47
the challenge was still trying to get our work hours in and plan
15:51
the Speak Out at the same time, and so there was that challenge.
15:57
And then also, the departments that we worked for would come in during our work
16:05
hours to talk to us about a Speak Out that they didn’t want to be involved with,
16:10
giving us advice and information as to what to do, even though they were telling
16:14
us that they don’t want to be involved in anyway shape or form with the Speak Out.
16:20
And so, that was just really emotionally draining, just knowing that the
16:27
people that are in positions that you thought are there for you and
16:31
that would be supportive, were not, but it was also really refreshing to
16:37
see other people, or other areas, or people, reaching out to support us.
16:43
So one of the two, the concerns were mostly like as students we
16:48
don't have the same resources that student employees do in reserving
16:52
space and getting a livestream for
16:55
folks who are not able to come.
16:56
So the space was provided to us by the director of player
17:03
personnel, which was Rachi Wortham?
17:08
I can’t remember his last name right now.
17:10
And then the livestream, OSU Livestream, was paid for and provided
17:15
to us by Susie Brubaker Cole.
17:16
So we were
17:19
supported by other areas that I didn’t really expect support from.
17:23
And then, so that wasn’t something that we had to worry about, primarily because
17:31
Rachi reserved Gill Coliseum for us and then Susie Brubaker got the livestream.
17:37
But then, we were still, it was still emotionally draining, continuously
17:40
being bombarded by our departments.
17:44
And then,
17:47
in a form of self-care, we actually took that weekend and spent it together.
17:52
And on the Sunday before we had the Speak Out, we all cut our hair in some way.
18:01
So I, this is still growing out [points at hair on side of head]
18:05
I shaved this part of my hair,
18:11
and then my hair was dyed red, was just doing a lot with my
18:15
visual representation of myself.
18:19
And what was the reason you wanted to do that?
18:21
Just like a change and just, yeah, a change
18:27
So you all did a change?
18:28
Mmhmm [in the affirmative] Haniya and I cut both sides here [indicates both sides
18:32
of her head] and Jesseanne got the back [indicates the back of her head] shaped
18:35
like a triangle, no, yeah, some shape.
18:38
That sounds awesome.
18:40
Yeah, it was just spontaneous.
18:44
So were there other folks involved with organizing the Speak Out, or
18:48
was it strictly the three of you?
18:50
In terms of organizing how the Speak Out would look it was
18:54
primarily me, Jesseanne, and Haniya.
18:58
And then outside of that, we had that support from Rachi
19:03
and Susie B-C.
19:05
So no other students?
19:07
Mmm Mmm [in the negative]
19:07
Did other students know about it?
19:10
Obviously, they went to it, but while you’re planning it?
19:14
I can’t really remember, if, how, because it started with, Tuesday, Haniya sent
19:22
out an email to all administration, the President Ed Ray and all the VPs
19:30
of all the different areas on campus, demanding their time to come and
19:36
listen to students of color’s concerns.
19:38
So I think once that letter was sent out,
19:44
we had a Facebook event, yeah, so students did know about it, and our
19:48
friends definitely knew about it.
19:50
So,
19:54
people knew about it, especially since it was within a week.
19:57
But there weren’t other people involved, or other students involved.
20:02
So was the Facebook event your primary method of marketing the event, or was it a
20:08
lot of face-to-face, word of mouth stuff?
20:12
I would say it was both, Facebook and word of mouth and telling people about it.
20:20
Nice, and obviously your marketing worked really well.
20:25
Yeah, and then President Ed Ray sent a letter to the entire student body.
20:34
That’s where we got a lot of people coming from.
20:36
And then, since I was involved in Greek life at the time, or I am, I was able to
20:46
connect with the director of fraternity and sorority life, because a lot of
20:54
the language around our student of color Speak Out was being warped
20:57
and turned into a “dialogue” and a “discussion” which is not what we wanted.
21:02
And so that was another challenge actually.
21:06
So clarification, Ed Ray sent an email prior to the event?
21:10
Mmhmm [in the affirmative]
21:11
. Okay, to just advertise, okay.
21:13
Yeah, to the entire student body about
21:17
the student of color Speak Out, not naming it the student of color Speak
21:20
Out, naming it primarily a “dialogue.”
21:24
Oh.
21:25
And then that’s the language other departments go to advertise it
21:28
to their departments or college.
21:32
So that was one of the causes for concerns so with those departments
21:36
we had connections to we tried to
21:41
clarify that language was not right.
21:43
Okay.
21:46
So how were you feeling leading up to the Speak Out?
21:50
Nervous.
21:53
I wasn’t good with crowds.
21:54
I also had a conference call right before the Speak Out.
21:59
I think in the livestream you can see me.
22:03
Leading up to the Speak Out I was on a conference call with somebody.
22:05
It was like a 30-minute conference call.
22:08
And so I was nervous, but I was also trying to deal with
22:12
other stuff at the same time.
22:14
So yeah, I’m not, especially the amount of people that came
22:18
was a lot, I was like, “Whooo.”
22:22
Do you know how many people came in the end?
22:25
Did you get an official head count?
22:28
I don't think we got an official head count.
22:29
A
22:32
lot.
22:32
I can’t even conceptualize how many people were there.
22:35
Just the whole stadium on one side was full and then the sides.
22:42
Hundreds.
22:43
Yeah, there’s pictures to prove to my friends.
22:46
Sorry I’m asking you all these additional questions, but I realized as we’re talking
22:50
that I never actually asked the other two.
22:55
What was the campus climate prior to the event and were there certain needs
23:00
that the university wasn’t addressing?
23:05
Which you mentioned part of your proposal, but?
23:15
I don’t know, my memory is not that great, so I’m not sure I
23:19
remember the campus climate before.
23:22
I think the recurring campus climate of apathy and just
23:27
ignoring the students of color’s concerns.
23:33
And learning the bias, just send in a bias report, just send in a bias report,
23:40
was the primary method of dealing with racism on an administrative level and
23:47
nothing was done with those bias reports.
23:53
So,
23:56
I’m trying to follow your specific highlights.
23:59
Describe the immediate response from the OSU administration
24:02
regarding the Speak Out.
24:04
Did they invite you to future conversations?
24:06
If so, did you feel that your voice was heard?
24:09
We were invited to speak with President Ed Ray and his team.
24:15
I’m not really sure what the rest of the VPs of the school, I don’t
24:20
know what the structure looks like.
24:22
But we were invited to a conversation with President Ed Ray, and there were the
24:28
three of us as students and then a whole table, conference table, of other people,
24:33
that, whose names I will never remember, and half of the faces that I don’t.
24:38
I primarily see two, three, of the people on, that were at the table, on
24:46
a semi every few months kind of thing.
24:51
But I can’t tell you who was at the table, except President Ed Ray
24:55
and me and Jesseanne and Haniya.
24:58
How did you feel about being asked to come to this conversation?
25:03
I
25:05
think, for me, I was hopeful.
25:07
I was actually very positive and hopeful that this would enact some
25:12
change, and so I was really hopeful about us being invited to the table.
25:21
But when we got there, I felt like it was a lot of
25:27
complaining?
25:28
I don’t know.
25:32
My immediate, the things I remember from the conversation was President Ray
25:36
continuing to be like [pounds hand on table] “We cannot continue business as
25:40
usual,” and him just saying that over and over again. And that’s exactly what
25:43
I feel happened after that conversation.
25:50
But were you able to provide your thoughts and express your
25:55
concerns further at that meeting?
26:01
I want to say we were given a small amount of time.
26:05
The majority of it was Ed Ray speaking, taking up a lot of space.
26:11
Interesting.
26:14
How did you feel about the initial response and action of the administration?
26:18
So referring to the email that Ed sent to everybody, creation of the
26:24
Office of Institutional Diversity.
26:27
And the town halls.
26:27
And the town halls, yeah.
26:36
I, well since I, my initial reaction to just the creation of the town halls?
26:43
Oh!
26:43
[Armas receives a cell phone with Ed Ray’s email] Oh
26:50
this is all the stuff that President Ray said he would do?
26:56
Oh yeah.
26:57
Okay, so he said he would do, he’d create a Chief Diversity Officer,
27:03
which he did, and was just hired this year, she’s going to start June.
27:12
Student representatives to Oregon State's existing leadership council.
27:21
Quarterly town halls, that was a thing that I don’t see anymore.
27:24
I think there were two?
27:26
Two.
27:26
There were two.
27:27
And the first one was a lot of Ed Ray talking back at students after
27:34
they had addressed their concerns.
27:36
So students would address their concerns about different things like
27:42
people wanting more space than they had, I think was primarily a lot of
27:47
what was being asked, for disability access services and then veterans.
27:55
I remember those specifically and I remember Ed Ray just responding to
27:59
that and saying, “ Well, we’ve come a long way doing this and this and this
28:04
and this,” and just taking up a lot of space to the point where someone had to
28:07
actually call him out and the tell him how instead, “You are here to listen and not
28:13
to defend the university,” essentially.
28:17
And then I didn’t, I don’t think I went to the second one, but I
28:21
heard it wasn’t that much better.
28:24
So I think my initial, my,
28:29
to the town halls, I just was very disappointed.
28:38
University will create referral systems and resources to address
28:41
bias concerns, a hotline,
28:47
will develop required online educational programs as well as
28:50
orientation programs, interracial awareness, civil and social justice
28:55
and diversity for entering students.
28:56
That is one thing that I think at the end of our time as dialogue educators we
29:02
were asked to be part of, specifically with Student Leadership and Involvement,
29:08
and that's where I work with now.
29:10
And so, that’s what I assumed I would be doing for some of the
29:19
year is developing those online modules, specifically with a social justice
29:24
framework and that’s not what, that, just, that program, or that vision, just
29:30
ended up dying sometime in the summer.
29:35
So you never actually got to be a part of any conversations about it?
29:38
Mmm Mmm
29:42
[in the negative]
29:42
. Did they tell you why it fell through?
29:45
No, because primarily for the student leadership and involvement, as a peer
29:51
advisor, the online module that I’d be making would be specifically for
29:54
clubs and not the first-year students.
29:57
But my supervisor [camera cut]
30:03
. That the online modules that we made for clubs and organizations, student-run
30:12
organizations, would be applicable or in
30:18
congruence with the first-year ones.
30:22
But the first-year modules never, I never heard anything about them
30:28
since, so my supervisor’s vision just kind of died out with that.
30:34
[Head nodding] Yeah, I think my initial, just, I felt like
30:44
a lot of councils were said that they were going to be made and I didn't really
30:49
see, I, we made it very clear that we didn't want to be the only students
30:55
that were helping out in these councils.
30:57
And that's what I felt they wanted, was that we would be the three primary
31:04
people helping them in their councils.
31:07
And I remember having a list of students who reached out to me and wanted
31:11
to be involved with these councils.
31:14
And I remember reaching out to
31:19
the dean of
31:23
student life [unintelligible] . I remember reaching out with that list and
31:27
being told that they already had enough students on the committees, and that
31:33
adding anymore students would essentially
31:39
mess up the weekly scheduling of those meetings.
31:43
And then after that conversation, I was asked to be on the committee,
31:48
and then I had said, “Well, I have this list of students that had wanted
31:53
to be involved. Can I forward this information to them?” I was still added
31:59
to that committee without being asked if I actually wanted to be on it, so.
32:05
And, they were saying there was too many students even though
32:10
it was just the three of you?
32:12
Were there other students that they pulled in?
32:15
I think, I definitely saw on email chains that I was involved with one or two
32:20
other students, but as far as getting other voices in that I know wanted to
32:28
be part of these conversations, they,
32:33
their first, the first time I asked them was, “Oh, we have enough.” And the
32:40
second time they just kind of ignored
32:45
me.
32:45
Interesting.
32:48
So how do you feel that the OSU community, which includes other students, staff,
32:54
and faculty, responded to the Speak Out and the events post Speak Out, and did
33:01
anyone specifically reach out to you?
33:05
The one… I remember the day after a lot of people were coming up to us that we
33:11
never seen before in our life thanking us for the Students of Color Speak Out.
33:16
It was a lot of administrators and faculty.
33:22
I remember the department that we worked for, that had wanted nothing
33:26
to do with us when we had actually organized the Speak Out, hosting a
33:35
department sponsored debrief about the Speak Out, getting a lot of, I
33:42
think, fake congratulations from them.
33:45
And then I remember Luke Kawasaki had been working with the College of Liberal
33:53
Arts, and trying to, I remember we had a Skype call with them to talk about
33:59
what the College of Libera Arts could do to help support students of color.
34:06
And so that was the, aside from just random people congratulating us, I
34:10
think that's the one college or person that actually reached out to us to
34:15
see what we wanted, what they can do.
34:20
And was that for students within the College of Liberal
34:23
Arts, or were they trying to...
34:25
Yeah.
34:25
Were they thinking of the whole campus?
34:27
I think it was predominantly College of Liberal arts, and what they can
34:32
do for their own college and their own students in that college, and
34:36
then also how they could support
34:42
our demands from the
34:49
university.
34:50
So after the event, in what ways did the university decenter students of color?
35:00
Let’s see... Well primarily that piece of not wanting too many students
35:08
involved with their committees.
35:11
Which I don’t know if half of them even exist anymore or
35:14
what they're doing with them.
35:16
I think the lack of transparency and communication from President Ed Ray and
35:24
the fact that we don't even know what those committees are or what they're
35:26
doing, or what OSU’s currently doing.
35:32
I think, just the overall lack of transparency is decentering students of
35:37
color, because we're not being told or informed about what progress is being
35:44
made within those departments, the Department of Institutional Diversity, or
35:53
just the various committees that they had made afterwards, or the online modules.
35:59
So just the lack of transparency.
36:02
If I’m not hearing about it, then nothing is being done, in my opinion.
36:07
So nothing is being done for students of color, if you can’t
36:11
tell us you're doing something.
36:15
And the point was to bring students into the conversation,
36:19
not continue to leave them out?
36:21
Yes.
36:22
Perfect.
36:22
Yeah.
36:24
Another thing, I think, I didn’t talk about it earlier, but we had
36:29
to meet with the Board of Trustees.
36:32
And the first, so they had wanted us Thursday night to have a dinner
36:37
with them, I think at 8 o’clock, and then the following morning at 9 a.m.
36:42
they wanted us to speak during the Board of Trustees meeting, before
36:46
they had their actual meeting.
36:48
And I remember, at the dinner, it was the three of us and the student representative
36:55
on the Board of Trustees were the only students there with the Board of Trustees.
37:00
And I remember,
37:04
I honestly, they said something about getting to know them more, and I
37:08
thought it would be us conversing about strategizing how to bring students
37:14
of color into these conversations and just make this campus better.
37:22
But, that's not what we got at all.
37:24
I feel like it just further widened the gap, for me at least.
37:31
Just hearing the conversations that they wanted to have with us instead of talking
37:36
about the Student of Color Speak Out,
37:40
being 15 minutes late to the dinner,
37:45
getting tipsy during the dinner,
37:49
and then just having conversations about their properties and the buildings they
37:54
wanted built at OSU, and just all the money that I’m listening to them talk
38:01
about that they’re essentially, I felt, wasting, instead of talking about how
38:09
to address students of color’s concerns of racism and white supremacy on campus.
38:15
And so
38:18
then, the previous day, the next day, Friday, we had breakfast with them.
38:26
I remember being late.
38:29
We had breakfast with them and then we had,
38:34
they had questions for us about what our goals were with the
38:38
Student of Color Speak Out.
38:39
I remember the department, the heads of the department we were
38:43
working for being present for that conversation and I don’t remember why?
38:48
They were introducing us.
38:49
They didn’t even introduce us right.
38:52
And I...
38:54
Did they mess up your name, or something?
38:57
They messed up our positions and the depar-, Social Change Leadership Programs.
39:04
I don’t think they messed up my name at least.
39:10
But yeah, and then I remember after that meeting, I remember someone talking about
39:17
using more, essentially what I heard was using more delicate language around
39:24
what the issues we were speaking about.
39:26
And I think I remember Jesseanne getting into the mic and saying, “We’re talking
39:30
about racism, that’s what we're talking about.” [laughs] . I remember that part.
39:35
And I remember after we left that President Ed Ray was given a $20,000 raise
39:44
by the Board of Trustees, for the amazing work he's doing on campus, for the school.
39:51
And how did you feel about that?
39:53
He was being rewarded for our Student of Color Speak Out, with money.
39:58
I had just been hearing about them and their vision about
40:01
what they’re going to build.
40:02
As an out of state student, I already know that most of my money goes towards
40:07
that and so just seeing that they're going to use another $20,000 to just
40:11
give to President Ed Ray, which I know he used for his scholarships, but
40:15
that’s not helping all OSU students.
40:19
And so,
40:23
they could have just done something else with that money.
40:24
They could’ve not given the money.
40:25
They could just stop wasting our money.
40:27
That’s another issue.
40:27
[laughs]
40:33
So, you’ve touched on a lot of the things in the question I’m about to ask, but
40:39
do you feel that the university is doing enough to address the concerns that
40:43
were brought up during the Speak Out?
40:45
In your opinion, what else could they be doing?
40:50
Aside from being more transparent, about what they're actually
40:55
doing right now, I think,
41:00
yeah I’m hearing a lot about plans still, planning to do this, planning to
41:06
do this and it's almost been two years.
41:08
So I’m wondering what’s actually been enacted outside of making the office
41:13
of, or Institutional Diversity Office?
41:16
And so I know there’s only, I think one person right now, and
41:21
there's going to be three by June?
41:25
I think there’s two now, and then there’s going to be a third.
41:28
But having three people work on systematic and institutionalized racism is very,
41:37
it’s going to be hard for them, and it’s not enough people working on this.
41:46
So, I
41:49
don’t think they’re doing enough,
41:55
yeah.
41:58
So, kind of leading off of that question, you don’t think that they’re doing
42:04
enough, so would you say that the campus climate, as it is now, has not changed
42:11
since the campus climate two years ago?
42:13
It's definitely changed, for the worst.
42:17
Just because of the current administration with the Cheeto Puff in office
42:28
[referring to President Trump] , and so a lot of white supremacist feel
42:31
a lot more empowered on campus and are given room to feel empowered.
42:37
And so I, aside from, I, you can’t, I can't really “aside from” this entire
42:46
Nazis in office deal, but the university is definitely not doing enough to
42:53
respond to white supremacy on campus.
42:59
When we did, when we had protested white supremacist building names,
43:07
the university was very adamant about policing the way that we protest, and
43:15
then had a town hall afterwards, which was not productive.
43:21
It was not facilitated well, and there wasn’t enough input on these,
43:28
on the questions that they wanted input on because of all the side
43:36
conversations and things that were going on within the people that
43:40
were present, specifically this little white supremacist corner.
43:46
And then, but then when there as white supremacist or white nationalist
43:52
posters on campus, they were quick to respond and say, “This is not, this does
43:58
not represent our campus,” And so, I just don’t think OSU is doing enough.
44:08
And that our campus climate is changing for the worst because of our current
44:12
administration [presumably referring to the Trump Administration] and it’s
44:16
still just isn’t enough being done.
44:20
Do you think that the administration has created improved avenues for students
44:25
of color to have this platform to talk about the issues that they face?
44:33
The
44:35
President and his admin-?
44:37
The OSU President?
44:39
Ed Ray and them?
44:40
I wouldn’t say that they’ve really created platforms because the town
44:44
halls that they were supposed to have quarterly don't exist and
44:48
weren’t facilitated in a good way.
44:53
And so, I would say that no.
45:01
I’d say that departments on campus and specific areas of campus are putting
45:06
on great events that are trying to bring space for students of color,
45:14
but not the university as a whole.
45:19
Well, that is the last question I have regarding the Speak Out.
45:24
I want to thank you again for your time.
45:28
And then I guess one last closing thought or question would be, do you
45:33
have any advice for future students who are trying to navigate OSU?
45:39
Yeah!
45:42
In terms of being a student,
45:46
well actually no, I’m just going to be in terms of trying to do activism on
45:50
campus, there's just a lot of apathy on this campus and it comes with
45:54
white fragility and it comes with just
45:59
a lot of white fragility.
46:02
But also, in terms of a university standpoint, I,
46:07
this is my fourth year and I’m going into my fifth year, and every year
46:11
there's always been something that we've had to protest for and every year
46:16
our responses and our demands are not met, so I’m quite tired of working,
46:24
or trying to work with the university and go at their pace of molasses.
46:30
So,
46:33
my advice is, so I mentioned earlier OSU cares a lot more about its reputation
46:44
and marketability to future students, as we can see with approximately 2
46:52
million dollars they’re spending on this logo change, after raising tuition.
46:58
So, they care more about their marketability than their students, I feel.
47:03
And so, if they’re not responding to your demands
47:11
for a more inclusive campus climate, then just in any avenue that you can,
47:18
threaten that reputation, in any avenue.
47:21
If that means bringing reporters on to campus from different,
47:25
like the Gazette Times, I don’t know what, I’m from LA, CNN?
47:33
No, I don’t know if CNN is around.
47:35
I don’t know.
47:36
The Oregonian, maybe?
47:37
Yeah, The Oregonian.
47:41
OSU really cares about its reputation.
47:42
I saw that, in, from I think Steve Clark is the VP of Marketing?
47:47
Yeah.
47:48
He really cares about that reputation, more than the programming
47:53
that's going on on campus.
47:54
So just threaten the University's reputation.
47:59
Slander them.
48:02
Well, thank you for those closing thoughts.
48:04
Thank you again for this oral history.
48:07
Oh yeah, and be resilient, like this nopal [motions to cactus drawing behind]
