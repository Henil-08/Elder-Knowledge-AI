00:02
My name is Natchee Barnd; I am an Assistant professor of Ethnic Studies and
00:05
Native American Studies as part of the School of Language, Culture and Society.
00:10
Today’s date is May 30, 2013,
00:15
and I am interviewing Matt Williams, a staff member of the Native American
00:19
Longhouse at Oregon State University.
00:22
So first we’ll start with just some basic information about yourself,
00:26
if you can tell me what is your name and then spell it out loud for me.
00:30
So my full name is Matthew Williams, but I go by Matt Williams, and
00:35
then it’s spelled M-A-T-T and then Williams is W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
00:42
Okay.
00:43
And what is your hometown, or where is home to you, or for you?
00:47
So, my hometown’s Winston, Oregon.
00:50
It’s a small town in Southern Oregon.
00:55
The town’s pretty much surrounded by a lot of
01:01
logging, and basically logging’s what made the town.
01:03
It’s also famous for Wildlife Safari, which is a zoo there.
01:10
It’s like a drive through wildlife park, and just kind of a random fact,
01:16
but I went to the same high school as Troy Polamalu and was coached by
01:20
Troy’s cousin, Joe Polamalu [laughs]
01:22
. Alright
01:24
[laughs] . Alright, so what is your age, your year in school, and your major?
01:28
Um…so I’m 21 years old right now, a junior here at Oregon State and I’m
01:35
majoring in Exercise and Sport Science, with the Fitness and Nutrition option,
01:40
also I’m a minor in Ethnic Studies with a Native American Studies emphasis.
01:47
Great.
01:48
And are you affiliated with a particular tribe or tribes?
01:52
So I’m enrolled with the Oglala Sioux tribe of South Dakota, and I also have,
01:59
some Cherokee and Osage ancestry as well.
02:02
Great, thanks.
02:03
Alright, so the next series of questions are about your work here at the Longhouse.
02:07
So, first question is what is your position at the Longhouse and what do
02:12
you do or what does that entail, and then, sort of a follow up, and how many
02:15
years have you worked for the Longhouse?
02:17
Uh, so currently I’m Internal Coordinator here at the Longhouse,
02:22
one of two coordinators, internal being a person who takes care of stuff
02:27
within the center, paperwork, purchase requests, uh, meets with the office
02:32
assistants and assigns tasks to them.
02:35
The External Coordinator deals with more of the outside things with the
02:38
community and with other centers on campus, um, so I’m pretty much a person
02:42
who’s in charge of maintaining, the center—make sure, you know, we have
02:47
things, like supplies stocked up, paper and supplies for students coming in.
02:53
A lot of what I do, I create the staff meeting agendas and help facilitate the
02:59
staff meetings and, just make sure the OAs and some of the support staff are
03:05
on task and basically be a person, that can provide support to groups coming
03:11
in and information to them, as well.
03:14
And how many years have you worked for the Longhouse?
03:16
So this is my third year working at the Longhouse; this year’s my first
03:20
year as an internal, uh last year I was Activities coordinator and freshman
03:25
year I was an Office Assistant.
03:27
So I’ve kind of went up the ladder in that aspect, and moved my way up.
03:35
Okay.
03:35
So it sounds like you didn’t have any other space, but
03:37
I’ll ask the question anyway.
03:38
Have you worked for any of the other cultural centers?
03:41
[Laughs] No, I haven’t worked for the other centers, um, I’ve considered
03:45
working for another center just to get new experiences, and working with
03:49
a different community, but even by working here at the Longhouse, we work
03:53
with all centers anyways, and we have meetings - the all coordinator meetings
03:58
we have with all the other coordinators at every other center - and so we do a
04:01
lot of work around, some collaborative events with other centers as well.
04:07
So we do get a lot of experiences with working with them, as well.
04:12
Okay, that question will come up again, so we may add to that later,
04:17
but when did you, or why did you decide to work at the Longhouse?
04:22
So, when I came here as a freshmen, I really had no clue there was a Longhouse,
04:29
until someone, one of my friends mentioned to me that—he knew I was, I identify
04:33
as Native, and he’s like, “Hey, you know, the Native American Longhouse is
04:36
hiring,” so I went over and applied and I got the job as the office assistant,
04:42
and basically, you know, I really had no intention of working there, honestly,
04:47
it’s just I needed a job at the time, but I’m really glad I did, because of
04:50
all the experiences that came about.
04:53
So…
04:55
Mhmm.
04:56
Thanks to that friend, right, that told you about it?
04:58
[laughs] . So, do you think that your expectations—although you said you
05:04
were—you know, you didn’t even think you were going to necessarily get the
05:07
job or work there, but, and I’m saying there because we’re sort of looking at
05:11
that old site, which is no longer there, but, um…whatever expectations or hopes
05:16
that you had for the work, and maybe not, maybe the first year, but maybe
05:19
the second and the third years, do you feel like those hopes or expectations
05:23
for your work were either matched or not matched or were they surpassed,
05:27
and maybe a little bit about why you felt like they sort of matched your
05:30
expectations or hopes for the positions?
05:32
Um, I think for the most part they matched.
05:36
I think they’ve exceeded some of my expectations with some of the
05:40
events that went on, and just planning and giving me experiences
05:44
personally, and growing from it.
05:47
I think it matched in the respect that it wasn’t something I wasn’t expecting.
05:52
I—I expected pretty much everything I experienced, and you know, I—it wasn’t
05:58
too much of a workload or anything.
06:00
It was just about right.
06:01
You know, it’s really nice that they, a lot of jobs on campus, especially the
06:05
cultural centers, work around your class schedules, and work around, you know, as
06:10
being student-led, student-run centers; I like that aspect of it, is that they
06:16
work around your schedules, and you know, whatever responsibilities that
06:22
you have with other groups on campus.
06:24
I’d say they meet for the most part, and in some ways exceeded.
06:27
So…
06:28
Okay.
06:28
So I’m going to split this second, this next question in actually into two parts.
06:33
So first part is can you describe the projects, events or activities
06:38
during the Fall Term, or specifically during Heritage Month, that were
06:42
especially meaningful to you?
06:44
So for Heritage Month one event that was important to me was actually an event
06:50
that I put on, which was acorn processing.
06:53
And I did that event with Margaret Mathewson, through the Anthropology
06:58
Department, and she basically came in and we worked on doing uh grinding
07:06
of acorns and I thought it was like really culturally significant, ‘cause
07:11
a lot of people would come in and learn the significance of, you know, what
07:14
acorns were used for as staples of diet, especially, you know, tribes in
07:19
Northern California, used them a lot.
07:21
And, I—I just thought events like that are really important to me because you
07:27
know, teaches people traditional ways, traditional lifestyles and also, you
07:31
know, modern day like people can still use acorns if they know what they’re
07:34
doing [laughs] . And so I really like that and using natural things from
07:40
the land and um…Let’s see, another event I thought [phone rings] was
07:46
really good was um…here we go, I have to [phone rings] stop trying…So the
07:53
other event that I really liked was actually the end of Heritage Month and
07:57
it was the indigenous feast which was
07:59
held at a dining hall here on campus and basically that consisted of,
08:06
there was chefs that came in and did traditional meals from different regions.
08:12
I believe we had some dishes from the Northeast, from the Southwest, we’ve
08:17
had the some dishes from the Southeast even, and Northwest, you know, salmon
08:22
being a stable to Northwest tribes diet.
08:26
And I just thought that was really cool how there’s foods from each
08:30
region of the U.S. represented there and it taught people about the kinds
08:34
of traditional diets and what, you know, the things people ate to live
08:40
on during, you know, when tribes lived off the land and everything, and I just
08:45
think it’s important that people, you know, experience that because it’s,
08:48
you know, part of the U.S. history, and the first peoples that were here.
08:52
Okay.
08:53
So the second part of this question then is can you then describe the
08:57
projects, events, or activities during the Winter or Spring Term that
09:01
were especially meaningful for you?
09:04
Um, so for the Winter Term we didn’t have a whole lot of events.
09:07
That’s usually our, um…our term where we’re kind of preparing for the Spring
09:11
term events, and we have a lot of downtime, but Spring Term, the two events
09:17
that were really significant to myself and to our staff was the Salmon Bake and
09:24
also a Pow Wow, which was put on by the NASA, Native American Student Association.
09:29
The Salmon Bake, you know, is just really important.
09:34
It’s our biggest event every year.
09:36
This year we’ve had well over a thousand attendees,
09:41
as well, you know, as having the family come over from
09:44
the Warm Springs Reservation.
09:45
They come every year and do a great job and this year we had a drum group and a
09:51
dance group and it’s just, it’s something people look forward to every year.
09:58
And we want to do a good job of putting that on, representing not only our center
10:02
but our community around OSU as well.
10:06
And what, so what’s the, whose the family that comes out from Warm Springs?
10:08
The family that comes from Warm Springs is the Jacksons, Kate Jackson is the grandma
10:15
and she comes and she’s pretty much the head of it all, and then she brings some
10:20
family members; I know Sheila is the mom, and then…I forget the name of the son,
10:28
but he comes every year and helps, and her friend Richard, who works for the
10:34
Environmental Resources office at Warm Springs, he comes and helps cook as well.
10:39
So they’re—they’re the same people that come every year and they’re
10:41
really supportive of Oregon State and the Longhouse in general.
10:45
Okay.
10:46
Alright.
10:49
So next question, what have been your challenges working at the
10:52
Longhouse and…how have you overcome them, whatever they may be?
10:59
I’d say some of the challenges that I’ve faced here is just trying
11:05
to manage time for the most part, because it is hard being a student and
11:10
working at a student-run, student-led center where expectations are higher.
11:14
And you have people coming in, especially with our new center, we have people
11:18
coming in all the time, and you have to be just prepared and you know, kind of
11:22
on spot, just to, you know, for people asking questions or they want to tour
11:27
and it’s just, it’s just managing time has been a little bit hard for me.
11:32
I know freshmen year I was on academic warning for one term, and so but Diversity
11:39
Development and Victoria Nguyen was very good with uh working with students,
11:44
you know, emphasizing academics first, and she put me with an academic coach
11:50
freshman year to get my grades up for the next term, and I think that was a
11:54
good learning experience for me, that term, just, you know, how to manage
11:59
time, to focus on school, and you know, I was a freshman trying to, you know,
12:03
find out where I stood in college, and trying to find where I fit in here
12:08
at Oregon State, and you know, I felt like the Longhouse was a good fit.
12:12
And then one other challenge is just kind of trying to put school first,
12:16
‘cause sometimes you want—might want to put the Longhouse work first, ‘cause
12:20
you really enjoy it or I really like being here and stuff, and, but you
12:25
know, school’s the first, should come first, is really important, and that’s
12:30
kind of one challenge is basically just the time management and everything.
12:36
Alright.
12:36
Great.
12:36
So what have you, or what would you say are some of your successes working at the
12:41
Longhouse, and this can be personal, it can be sort of programmatic, or otherwise.
12:45
Um, I’d say a lot of my successes, a lot of mine personally came last year
12:51
when I was Activities Coordinator, because I put on activities—coordinators
12:56
are required to put on two events per term, that’s six per year.
13:00
And when I was activities I put on, the acorn processing which is
13:06
kind of an annual thing we do every year, and also we had a storytelling
13:11
event, which was really good.
13:12
A lot of people from other cultural centers came to that as well.
13:17
And it was Gordon Bettles, he’s a storyteller, an elder from the
13:22
Longhouse in U of O in Eugene, and he’s really good and that—that
13:28
event was important to me, you know.
13:30
I’d see those two events as accomplishments on my part, especially the
13:35
acorn processing that we do it every year now, and we have good relations with the
13:40
Anthro department and for future events, we’ve had discussions about, you know,
13:46
doing like an outdoor space outside of this center and maybe doing like brain
13:51
tanning and things like that, you know, a little more messy but traditional
13:55
things, you know, that are really cool.
13:58
So I believe that, that’s a big accomplishment on my part, just
14:02
getting that started with the Anthro department and those relations, so…
14:08
Great…so what—and you mentioned this earlier, but um, as of—to return to
14:12
it, what have you been here—what have been your interactions with staff
14:15
from the other cultural centers?
14:17
Um…so freshman year I didn’t have a whole lot of interaction with the
14:22
staff, just being an Office Assistant.
14:25
Really the only reason I would go to the other centers is if they sent me on an
14:29
errand or something, to run flyers or things like that [laughs] . You know,
14:34
being a new guy they kind of send you on the jobs no one wants to do, so…
14:39
[laughs]
14:39
that was my really only interaction with the other staff, and I didn’t know half
14:43
the staff in the other centers when I was a freshman, but the last couple of
14:46
years, being Activities Coordinator and doing events, I’ve had a collaborative
14:51
event with the Black Cultural center, so I had to work a lot with some of the staff
14:56
there, and I knew a few of the staff, from freshmen year there as well, but
15:02
I did an event with them, uh, centering around African American/Native American
15:06
relations, like especially in the South.
15:09
Um, like during the Civil War era, and we had Dr. Robert Thompson come in
15:16
and speak from Ethnic Studies, on some of those relations and relations, you
15:21
know, I wasn’t even that much aware of until, you know, that event and then
15:26
a lot of people, you know, discussed some of those historical relations
15:30
between tribes and African Americans.
15:33
So that—that was one way I worked with the other centers, was doing
15:37
some of those collaborate events.
15:39
This year I’d say more—I know most of the staff at all of the centers [laughs]
15:44
this year, so it’s more I see them at the events that all centers attend, or
15:50
like, you know, Salmon Bake a lot of the other centers were there, their staff.
15:54
So some of the bigger events on campus, you know, like the step
15:57
show they just had last weekend.
15:59
I saw a lot of staff from other centers, so, usually at these bigger events is
16:03
when we get to meet with them and also at the all coordinator meetings we meet
16:07
with a lot of the other staff, as well.
16:08
Mhmm.
16:09
Okay.
16:10
And so, I—actually it’s a follow up, so on the…um, the…black
16:15
and native sort of…event, was that, how was that initiated?
16:20
Was that initiated through the cultural center staff, or…
16:22
That was—yeah, that was initiated through the staff; that was actually me and uh,
16:28
Yohana Abraham, she activities last year for the Black Cultural Center, we just
16:35
wanted to work together ‘cause we needed another event ‘cause we were required to
16:38
do two each per term, and that counted as one, even though we collaborated.
16:43
And she just wanted to, you know, what are some ways we can collaborate and do
16:48
a historical event between the native Longhouse and the Black Cultural Center,
16:52
and that was one way, because Dr. Thompson was knowledgeable on some of
16:56
the race relations during the time, so we just had that talk and Yohanna I’ve
17:01
known since I came here to OSU; I was
17:03
in a bridge program, prior to um, Fall Term starting freshman year.
17:09
It was basically like we took a course, transition to college and we went on
17:13
a rafting trip and it was a really fun experience, just getting that tra—er
17:17
transition to college, and that’s where I met her and so kind of she
17:21
was a person I met since, I mean, ever since I’ve been here, so we wanted
17:25
to work together on an event, so…
17:27
That’s great…Cool, alright so I have two questions just about the new Longhouse.
17:33
So first one is just were you a part of the design process for the new
17:37
Longhouse, especially since you’ve been here for several years, and if so,
17:40
just, a little bit about how what—how, what, how you participated in that.
17:43
Yeah, so wasn’t…too involved with the actual design of the
17:48
structure of the building.
17:50
I was more involved with the placement of some of the items, the totem pole, the,
17:55
some of the furniture, the television, things within this center, myself,
17:59
Tyler Hogan and Daniel Cárdenas were
18:04
involved with making those decisions and you know I felt like that was, I’m
18:10
glad Victoria asked us that because, you know, we can have our input as
18:13
to where those items are placed.
18:15
And also some of the, some of the doorways we were kind of discussing,
18:21
you know, where would those go, but we weren’t involved too much with
18:24
the whole structure, outside, you know, frame design of the center.
18:29
Okay.
18:31
And then sort of a more of a reflective question here is, you know, what,
18:34
you know, we have just transitioned right, and so what would you say
18:38
the new Longhouse means to you?
18:41
So…to me, you know, this new Longhouse has been, a long time coming, in my opinion.
18:50
To me it means a lot because, it’s one of the newer structures on campus, even
18:54
though there’s a lot of construction going on right now; it is something that people
18:59
see, um, you know, just walking by going to Dickson, they’re just like, you know,
19:04
“Wow, that’s—that’s a great center” - you know, just kind of mind-blown by how,
19:10
how beautiful it is and everything, and when people come in, you know, it’s great
19:15
to hear things like, “Oh this is—I’ve never seen a Longhouse like this” and
19:19
there really isn’t too many cultural centers on college campuses, so, to me
19:24
it’s really special that, you know, I’m fortunate to be here at Oregon State
19:27
where they’re really inclusive of diverse communities and they’re making this
19:32
possible for all the cultural centers.
19:34
Not just ours, but as rebuilding them and as brand new cultural centers, so…
19:40
Great.
19:41
Uh, so the next, series of questions are just about the future and the
19:46
larger picture of the Longhouse and, you know, the future of the Longhouse.
19:52
So first is what projects, events, activities, etcetera, would you
19:57
have liked to have seen, or would you recommend for the future?
20:00
Some things you thought about would be great.
20:03
It sounds like you did initiate several but are there are others that you still
20:06
kind of think it would be really great if someone in the future could do this?
20:10
Right.
20:10
Um, there are a few things like I mentioned with the, with Anthro doing
20:16
some of the outdoor, you know, things, like brain tanning, I think that’d
20:19
be great to do more of those events.
20:22
Also one event that Mariah Huhndorf, our activities, was trying to do for
20:27
a while but never really got a lot of support for doing it, was an Alaskan
20:32
Native Games, and basically now we have the space to do that kind of thing.
20:38
It would be great if we could maybe collaborate even with Dickson Rec and,
20:41
or do it there or something, which, you know, we’d have like a full basketball
20:45
court to do it, and maybe work with uh Greek Life on doing something, ‘cause I
20:50
know Greek Life is like not as involved with the cultural centers, and I feel
20:54
like there should be some sort of tie as like to cultural awareness within
20:59
those communities, ‘cause there is not a lot with the Greek community.
21:03
But just having something fun and open for people like that, maybe they
21:06
can, the Greek communities can sponsor t-shirts or something for the event
21:11
as they’re really good at doing those sort of things, like fundraisers.
21:15
Just having something like that would be really good, I think, in my opinion,
21:18
just to, you know, have an open, fun event, and that way, you know, Greek
21:22
life will learn a little bit about, you know, the cultural centers and the
21:25
Native American Longhouse in specific.
21:29
A few, one other thing I really think that’s lacking is, myself and Tyler
21:34
and Daniel had discussions about is actually going out to visit high
21:40
schoolers from Native tribes in Oregon.
21:43
Maybe doing, you know, every term doing a trip to a different reservation,
21:48
or a different, tribal community in Oregon and just talking to, you know,
21:51
high school juniors and seniors about coming to college, and where the
21:55
resources that OSU provides for Native students, and ‘cause I feel that’s
22:00
really important, especially with Native student retention being not very good
22:05
at most universities and even here.
22:08
You know, things like the Longhouse is a great opportunity for a lot of
22:13
students to you know, to have support and feel like that second home, you know.
22:20
Mhmm…Alright, so what advice would you give future Longhouse staff, or
22:25
just generally any OSU cultural center staff, from your experience, you know,
22:30
you’ve had several years at least, so you’ve seen a lot of things [laughs]
22:33
. [laughs] I feel like one of the best pieces of advice I can give to someone
22:39
working here or at any cultural center is just to, if you’re coordinator, its
22:46
best to delegate tasks, because then, I know, beginning of this year, a couple
22:51
times I wouldn’t delegate things and then everything would be on me to get done.
22:56
So I wasn’t as good at doing that as I should have been, but use your office
23:00
assistants if you’re coordinator, make sure they’re they have tasks assigned,
23:04
things to do, and also just, just working as a group, especially on the bigger
23:09
events, because it’s hard when maybe two or three of the coordinators are doing a
23:13
lot of the bulk of the work and then the office assistants and other support staff
23:18
are, you know, just doing small assignments.
23:20
It’s good to work together and, especially when the big events come, to
23:25
execute them, you know, it’s easier with the full staff on board working, so…
23:31
Sounds like it’s probably beneficial for them as well, right?
23:34
Possibly preparing them for a transition to get other positions, and…
23:37
Yeah, and that, that actually, you know, after this year a few of our
23:41
office assistants considered applying for activities coordinators next year.
23:45
So that’s just something that helps them prepare, and even office assistants, if
23:49
they wanted to put on an event together, that’d be a great experience for them,
23:53
you know, actually doing an event and maybe, maybe having to, you know,
23:57
talk in front of people or something they’re not used to doing, so it really
24:01
prepares, you know, students for getting those experiences and moving up, so.
24:06
Yeah.
24:08
Okay.
24:09
So based on working at the Longhouse, what is a take-away that you’ve gained,
24:13
that you would like to share with others,
24:18
so other than sort of the advice, but what take-away do you think you’ve…you
24:23
would bring with you when you leave, so thinking about what, you know, I mean
24:26
once you’re gone, you’re graduated, you’re out in the world, what is that
24:29
thing that you, that you’ve gained that you’re going to take away, you think?
24:32
One thing uh, personally I think I’ve gained is just, one thing is maturity.
24:38
I think I’ve matured a little bit since coming here freshmen year.
24:41
And just learning to be more responsible, you know, working with a staff.
24:47
You have to work with a group, so that can apply to any job
24:50
that you get in the future.
24:53
You know, having someone ahead of you, like Daniel’s ahead of me, so.
24:57
You know, respecting authority and just, just general things really, working
25:01
with a group, learning to you know, make deadlines; pretty much anything we do
25:08
here is maybe not to, like, an extreme like, you know office, like business job
25:14
or something, but it does prepare you just for things like that in the future.
25:19
Whatever your job might be, whether it’s, you know, you’re going to be a P.E.
25:23
teacher, or you know, working with uh, as a CEO of Nike or something [laughs]
25:29
it really applies like, in any way, so…
25:33
Those skills right?
25:34
Those skills that you need.
25:36
Um…so what is the biggest issue for you in terms of the purpose
25:41
of the Longhouse and why do you think that is an important issue?
25:47
I think one of the biggest things, one of the biggest misconceptions that students
25:53
have when they come in here is that “Oh, do you have to be Native to come in here?
25:57
Is it just for Native Americans?” And, we’re trying to, you know, get this
26:02
out to the community here at OSU that, you know, it’s not just for Native
26:05
Americans, it’s for, you know, we’re here to support the Native community as
26:09
well as the non-native community, and any students that come in here, and you
26:14
know, we’ve had students come in and show us their tribal enrollment cards…
26:17
[laughs]
26:17
and it’s like “you don’t have to do that, you know?
26:20
Really, just, it’s fine, anyone can come in here, it’s open to anyone.” And
26:24
I don’t know who puts these things in people’s minds, but it’s just, we’re
26:28
trying to, you know, make our presence on campus and you know, it’s kind of been
26:33
an issue because, I mean, sometimes we have the same students that are coming
26:37
in here and a good majority of them do identify as Native American, which is
26:43
good you know, we’re supporting Native students, but there’s still some here
26:46
that, you know, just don’t come by or choose not to be here, but just getting
26:51
our presence felt on campus, that we are supportive of some of these other Native
26:55
students here, as well as non-native, so…
26:57
Mhmm.
26:58
Okay…uh so how would you describe the impact of the
27:02
Longhouse on Native students?
27:03
And you’ve sort of already started to answer that, but…
27:06
Yeah, so I noticed the transition from our old center to our new center.
27:13
We had some new students that were transfer students here that started
27:18
coming regularly and they started showing up and I noticed they’re—they kind of
27:24
stuck around, and there’s a few of them that have considered even applying here
27:27
next year for a job, so for the most part, you know, I think we’re doing a
27:31
pretty good job, and now that we have the events like the Grand Opening and
27:35
we had a lot of Native alumni, and a few students here, you know, that were
27:39
there and they were like, “Oh man, this place is cool, and, I’ll start coming
27:42
by more,” so. And our NASA group, you know, has gotten bigger, with the Native
27:46
American Student Association putting on the Pow Wow this year, so I feel like um,
27:52
for the most part we got a pretty decent start, but I’d like to see the numbers
27:56
go a little higher in the future, so…
28:00
Mhmm.
28:01
Okay.
28:01
So parallel to that, how would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on
28:04
OSU and the local community more broadly?
28:07
Um…on OSU,
28:12
it’s a positive impact for the most part.
28:15
Now that you know, all these changes with Oregon State, and Oregon State being
28:20
you know, one of the, I consider one of the top institutions in the country
28:26
to go to college, especially you know,
28:28
like engineering, agriculture, really popular programs, forestry, and more
28:33
of a really science based college.
28:37
I just think it says a lot about how inclusive a university is when
28:41
they’re, you know, putting this much effort out to rebuild cultural centers.
28:47
It says a lot and it says a lot about how supportive Oregon State is of
28:50
the Native community here and the surrounding tribes you know, with
28:54
Grand Ronde and Siletz being right over here towards the coast, you know it’s
29:00
really supportive to them, they see that and they’re like you know, OSU’s
29:03
supportive of us as being Native people.
29:07
Even though not—Corvallis is not necessarily the most diverse,
29:11
especially in regards to Native American population, but just in the
29:14
surrounded area, with the surrounding tribes, I think it says a lot, so…
29:19
Okay.
29:21
Uh, so what suggestions or ideas do you have for future collaboration
29:25
between the Longhouse and with OSU or with the larger communities, so
29:31
ideas of an event you may have or how the Longhouse might collaborate,
29:37
differently than maybe they are already?
29:40
Um, I feel like with the University in general, uh, we haven’t really
29:48
done a whole lot um, that I know of.
29:52
You know, Daniel or Tyler might speak better on this, but I really haven’t
29:57
seen like a lot between, you know, the OSU…like, I don’t know, just in general
30:03
the OSU community and the Longhouse.
30:08
I have seen, you know, things like the Grand Opening, I know President
30:11
Ed Ray and Larry Roper have shown their support, but I’d like to see
30:16
more from some of the departments and colleges focusing more with us.
30:21
I know there’s a couple groups that have reached out and that’s a good start.
30:25
Student Health Services is one that’s reached out to us a lot
30:28
and really wants to collaborate.
30:30
They actually met with all the centers and, or really wanted to focus on health
30:35
related issues within each community and I really thought that was a great idea, you
30:40
know, just for that awareness, you know they focus with us on, you know, diabetes,
30:45
and things like that, and they’re just, you know, they came and talked to our
30:48
staff and were just like, “Hey what are some things we can collaborate with on
30:51
in the future in regards to you know, promoting health awareness here at OSU?”
30:57
And I felt like that was a good start and a good initiative for them, and
31:02
I was glad to see them, you know, put their head forward and kind of you know,
31:07
get out there and meet with us, ‘cause there’s very few groups have done that.
31:12
I know the Center for Civic Engagement has met with us and, you know, I’ll
31:20
be attending the trip to Warm Springs after this term, for a week, doing
31:24
community service, and I feel like that was a good outreach program with
31:27
them, you know, just you know, student sustainability has reached out to us.
31:32
So there’s been a few groups that have really wanted to work with
31:36
us; I feel like there needs to be more like, involvement with like
31:39
the College of Public Health and Human Sciences, the you know and now Ethnic
31:44
studies is being involved, so, there are groups, I just want, like, to see more
31:48
departments getting involved with us.
31:51
It sounds like you also—you’re suggesting that it does require
31:55
them to take some initiative to sort of make those links, ‘cause…
31:58
Yeah
31:58
‘cause you all are fairly limited
32:00
right
32:00
in terms of how much you can do outside, but it sounds like you’re appreciative
32:03
when they make that effort to bring in and say, “Look we’re thinking
32:06
about you, we want you, we want you, we want to be in, you know, have a
32:09
partnership with you in some way”
32:11
Right and they do have to take that initiate, we’ve also had uh, Susan
32:16
Flores from the OSU Alumni Association, she’s been super supportive of us,
32:20
and she kind of came out of nowhere.
32:22
No one knew who she was before, and now—
32:24
--I think she’s, I think she’s new, so that’s partly what it is too [laughs]
32:26
Okay [laughs] , but she’s taken a really big initiative in working with us and
32:32
I’m glad she is, you know, working with these alumni groups, Native alumni and
32:37
things like that’s really helpful to the center and helpful to us as a staff.
32:42
So yeah, I mean, I feel like these groups needed to take initiative
32:45
for the most part, and to help us, you know, collaborate with us.
32:50
Yeah.
32:50
I know personally I also met a lot of the alumni just this last event from the
32:55
Grand Opening and then alumni event that followed that evening, and I was able to
33:00
meet a lot of Native alumni, many of them had worked in the Longhouse in previous
33:04
years, so that was already could see the impact of that kind of initiative.
33:10
Um…last uh, question in this future and larger picture section here, can you
33:16
describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories, or these kinds of stories,
33:21
is important to you and to your identity?
33:25
You know, I could probably talk a long time on this, but just sharing
33:32
a person’s experiences in general and their history or where they come from
33:37
is just helpful to the future of the Longhouse, to their staff, you know,
33:44
cause they can go back and listen to
33:45
these and you know, take advice from it and learn you know, where has this
33:49
center been, how far has it come?
33:52
you know we’ve, we’ve been at the old Longhouse since 1971, so that’s, so
33:58
that’s a long time you know, to wait for a new center and now we have all
34:02
this going on and we’ve had, you know, high school groups coming through now
34:06
from reservations and from other tribes in Oregon and that’s something we
34:12
really like to see because those groups are seeing that, you know, there’s a
34:17
place for native students and moving forward just the oral tradition, you
34:22
know, talking about like where we come from is good, you know, students can
34:27
kind of see “Oh maybe they’re from the same tribal community or something”
34:31
or from the same area, you know.
34:34
My my dad being adopted from Pine Ridge, when—Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota,
34:40
when he was a year old was, was pretty you know, devastating to him actually,
34:45
as a person, ‘cause he didn’t know a lot about his tribal heritage growing up,
34:49
and when he got older he had to kind of relearn you know, like where he came from.
34:54
He went and worked at an alcohol rehabilitation center for five years and
34:59
they put on a Pow Wow every year, and he would, he would help do that in California
35:04
where he was living at the time and he learned a lot about his culture that away.
35:10
You know, just things like that, learning where people come from, that’s where my
35:13
whole native family is from, Pine Ridge and so you know, it’s just interesting
35:20
to hear stories about where people come from, you know, some of their experiences.
35:24
I heard stories form my dad and great uncle when he grew up on Pine Ridge and
35:28
you know all the crazy things that were happening during AIM and 1970s back there.
35:34
You know, I just think for the most part it’s really cool to hear other people’s
35:38
stories, I like listening to them, so.
35:43
So there’s one question just about campus sort of experience, can you
35:48
describe your experiences at OSU pertaining to your racial or ethnic
35:52
identity and/or your tribal affiliation, so just generally what had it been
35:56
like and what is your experience as a Native person walking around campus?
36:01
[laughs]
36:01
Being at OSU, like, how would you describe that?
36:05
You know, it’s interesting because I noticed when I first came here, you know,
36:11
working at the Longhouse a lot of my friends from the dorms were like, “Oh,
36:14
you know Matt works at the Longhouse” and stuff and they knew, like a lot of
36:19
them know I was Native and I am mixed ‘cause my mom’s white and stuff so, you
36:25
know I’m not someone who fully identifies as, but I noticed some of the events
36:31
like the N7 basketball game that go on on campus you know, I some students
36:36
that were like you know, “Why are we supp- paying all this money for new
36:41
jerseys when we have one Native American
36:42
basketball player being Joe Burton?” And I was just like why would they think that?
36:49
Do they know what N7 really is?
36:50
They’re wearing the t-shirts, but do they know what it’s about?
36:54
‘Cause I’ve met Sam McCracken who’s the director of N7 and he’s you know,
36:59
the whole purpose of N7 is to support tribal youth and providing the sport
37:04
opportunities because I think that’s important and a lot of the reservations
37:09
where, a lot, basketballs a main sport on reservations and that’s kind
37:14
of an outlet when there’s maybe not a lot of opportunities there, so it
37:20
provides the opportunity so you know, people don’t realize the purpose.
37:24
And I know during Halloween time it’s challenging ‘cause you see a lot of people
37:31
with stereotypical you know headdress and the little flap they wear and you know,
37:37
as the Indian maiden, things like that.
37:40
We had one cultural center event around stereotypes during Halloween,
37:47
what not to wear kind of deal.
37:48
[laughs]
37:51
Events like that are really important in my in mind ‘cause people don’t realize
37:54
the effect or may not realize like who’s around them or someone’s that not like,
38:01
they don’t appear Native or something.
38:04
I’ve kind of faced both sides because people see they Native in me but
38:07
then they’re like, “But you’re White and Native” – I’m like – or they’re
38:10
like my dad’s family, “Oh, you’re White” and I visit my mom’s family
38:15
and they’re like “Oh, you’re Native.”
38:17
[laughs]
38:17
So, it’s kind of both sides you know stuck in the middle.
38:22
It’s interesting just a lot of the students are not aware of the issues.
38:28
I haven’t really faced too much prejudice, but you know like in high school some,
38:32
some of my friends, just jokingly, “Oh how’s your teepee holding up?”
38:36
and stuff like that, you know, so just things like that, a lot of people are
38:41
not aware of – I know last year when Oregon, or last Fall when Oregon State
38:47
was playing Utah Utes football team and I heard some girls in the back sitting
38:53
behind us they’re like, “What’s a Ute?” like it was an animal or something.
38:58
And I’m like, “It’s a Native American Tribe” and they’re like,
39:00
“Oh, I had no idea” – you know, so just things like that, you
39:04
know, I’ve seen especially during Halloween, it’s just interesting, so.
39:12
So the last question is more actually for you to add anything that you feel that
39:17
you want add, anything you want to go back to that you felt like you missed or maybe
39:21
you want to share one more thing about or any last statements that you might
39:26
want to leave, anything just to wrap up…
39:30
Um…I mean, I think I covered a lot [laughs]
39:35
Yes.
39:35
So far, one thing I would say is that I think for us to move forward as a center
39:43
we need to work with Admissions in going to making trips to these tribes working
39:49
with Admissions and having representatives from OSU go to talk to high school
39:53
juniors and seniors so we can get the ball rolling so to speak on trying to
39:59
you know kind of recruit I guess Native students and say hey you know provide
40:04
pamphlets with our majors and some of the programs here at Oregon State, you
40:09
know that we have an American Indian Admission office, we have a Longhouse,
40:13
you know we have a Pow Wow that’s starting to grow, Salmon bake you know just the
40:20
retention, to improve retention rates to move forward we really need to go
40:23
visit the tribes and put our heads out there instead of, you know, tribes are
40:28
starting to come here too but we really need to go out and visit these communities
40:32
especially right over here since were so close to Siletz and Grand Ronde;
40:36
it’s important to be involved with those communities and show our support as well.
40:42
Alright well that’s it, so thank you.
