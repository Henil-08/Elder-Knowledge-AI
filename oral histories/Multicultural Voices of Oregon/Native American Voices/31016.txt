00:02
My name is Natchee Barnd, I am an Assistant Professor of Ethnic Studies and
00:05
Native American studies as part of the School of Language, Culture and Society.
00:10
Today’s date is May 30, 2013
00:14
and I am interviewing Mariah Huhndorf,
00:20
a staff member of the Native American Longhouse at Oregon State University.
00:25
So, we’ll start off with the basic questions just about yourself.
00:29
If you can tell us what is your name and then please spell it out loud.
00:34
Okay, my name is Mariah Huhndorf; that’s M-A-R-I-A-H and then
00:38
Huhndorf is H-U-H-N-D-O-R-F.
00:42
Great, and what is your hometown or where is home to you?
00:46
I was born and raised in Kenai, Alaska.
00:51
So that’s both home and hometown?
00:53
Yes.
00:53
Ok, just want to make sure [laughs] . What is your age, year
00:58
in school right now and your major?
01:01
Ok, I’m 21 years old, this is my third year in school, and my
01:06
major is General Science with an emphasis on Pre-Physician Assistant.
01:12
And then, fourth, are you affiliated with a particular tribe or tribes?
01:17
Yes, on my mom’s side I’m Athabaskan, and then for my dad’s side, Yupik.
01:23
Alright, so these next set of questions are geared toward asking
01:27
about your work here at the Longhouse.
01:29
So the next eight questions or so, so first, what is your position at the
01:33
Longhouse right now and what do you do?
01:35
And then, as sort of a follow, how many years have you worked for the Longhouse?
01:40
My current position is activities coordinator…
01:45
Just
01:47
what is that, what do you do?
01:49
I just put on events.
01:52
Other organizations also reach out to me to help them put on events that have to
01:57
do with the Native American Longhouse.
02:00
So I’ve been doing that this year.
02:04
I also worked at the Longhouse last year as a sophomore, and
02:08
I was an office assistant then.
02:11
There I just helped around the office, led people to the right resources, and just
02:16
was a welcoming face when people came in.
02:19
Can I ask you a follow up?
02:20
So when you help the groups that are coming in that want to have events,
02:23
what kind of things did you, what’s the range of things, I imagine
02:27
there’s a lot of different variety.
02:29
Usually they want to do some kind of craft.
02:31
A popular one is making dream catchers.
02:33
So, I usually
02:36
give a little background on dream catchers and then teach them how to make them.
02:38
A lot of people show up for that.
02:40
I’ve also done this new event that I kind of created was Totem Art.
02:44
And we just painted totem designs on pieces of wood.
02:48
And of course before then I explained the meaning of it.
02:52
It’s just kind of a fun craft, as well as learning a little bit about
02:55
the culture that goes along with it.
02:57
So, were those initiated by outside interests?
02:59
Or was that something that you proposed and then brought in folks to participate?
03:04
Um, both, for the Totem Art, I first did that for my own
03:08
event here at the Longhouse.
03:10
Then I had like dorm halls come and say “Hey, I want to do an event for my
03:14
dorm.” And then I kind of collaborated with them and did it. And same with
03:17
the dream catchers, we’ve done dream catchers in the past as just an event.
03:21
Usually like in the beginning of the year to kind of welcome people to the
03:23
Longhouse and tell them what it’s about.
03:25
Then word kind of gets out that we do that, so then other dorms…
03:30
Will ask for it?
03:31
Yes.
03:31
Ok, thanks.
03:34
So, second question on this.
03:35
Have you worked for any of the other cultural centers, and
03:39
if so when, and what position?
03:40
I have not.
03:41
I’ve worked here at the NAL.
03:43
You only have one more year left, two out of three here.
03:47
Why did you decide to work at the Longhouse?
03:50
I decided to work here because I heard about it when I was in high school because
03:56
my brother and sister used to work here.
03:58
So, my junior year in high school I came and visited them, and I thought
04:02
it was really cool, and I just kind of thought I’d kind of bring on the
04:05
tradition so all three of us worked here.
04:07
Wow,
04:09
that’s amazing [laughs] . That is a nice tradition.
04:13
Were your expectations or hopes for your work here matched,
04:15
surpassed or not matched.
04:18
And it sounds like you also had that background, so I imagine
04:21
you had some ideas about your experience when you came in.
04:26
So, either in your position last year or this year, I guess, how did you feel
04:31
your expectations for the work here were matched, or not, or surpassed?
04:38
I thought it was pretty good.
04:39
Like, I always thought working at NAL would be pretty cool because, like, I’d be
04:43
able to share my own culture from Alaska.
04:47
I definitely have been able to do that because people always ask about
04:49
it, and it’s just cool to compare Alaska native culture to Native
04:54
American, like, here on the coast.
04:58
So, yeah, I think my expectations and hope of working here were matched.
05:03
[Laughs]
05:06
Okay.
05:08
Can you describe the projects—I’m going to break this into actually two parts—can
05:12
you describe the projects, events, activities, etcetera during the Fall Term.
05:17
So, specifically during Heritage Month that were especially meaningful to
05:21
you, whether they were your events or just Longhouse events more broadly.
05:26
Yes, so as an activities coordinator I had come up with events, and we just
05:32
obviously did them during Heritage Month.
05:34
One that I did was Alaska Winter Games, which is based off the
05:41
Native Youth Olympics from Alaska.
05:42
Right.
05:43
So I just went and explained, like, what those games, like, how they were done
05:46
and then kind of the meaning behind them.
05:48
And that was obviously meaningful for me because it allowed me to bring
05:53
Alaska native culture down here and people kind of realized how different
05:57
it was but how there’s still connection.
06:00
So, I had a lot of fun putting on that event.
06:02
I definitely heard a lot of good feedback about it too.
06:04
Everybody was very excited about it [laughs]
06:06
[Laughs] Yeah.
06:07
Sounds like it was a very memorable activity for a lot of folks.
06:12
So if I can, so the second part has the same question, but I kind of wanted
06:16
to break up the Fall Term Heritage Month stuff from the more recent stuff
06:20
because, obviously, the most fresh set of events and activities just happened,
06:26
so I wanted to make sure we sort of think about the year, across the year.
06:32
So, can you describe the projects, events, activities, etcetera during
06:36
the Winter or Spring Terms that were especially meaningful to
06:42
you?
06:42
One event that I explained earlier was the Totem Art.
06:48
That turned out to be a pretty big event.
06:50
I would say that’s pretty meaningful too because, again, that kind of like,
06:53
goes back to my culture in Alaska and it kind of originated from there.
06:57
So, just being able to do events like that, that kind of relate my culture,
07:00
just makes it more happy, and I’m more excited to do stuff like that.
07:06
And it was also cool too because now that with the Totem art, or Totem Pole
07:09
here, like, it tied everything in.
07:12
It just was a lot of fun.
07:14
That’s great.
07:15
So, what have been your challenges working at the Longhouse and
07:19
how have you overcome them?
07:22
[laughs]
07:24
um...
07:29
No challenges?
07:30
[laughs]
07:31
[Laughs] In terms of…?
07:34
It can be in terms of anything.
07:37
It can be business it can be…you know…
07:39
Um, I would say like we have so much going on here and we’re not
07:43
all working like at the same hours.
07:46
So, just the communication, we do pretty good at it, but there’s
07:50
just always a little thing that might not get understood.
07:55
Especially with the new Native American Longhouse we have a lot of events that
07:59
aren’t associated with us, so, people expect us to know what that event is,
08:03
so they come in and ask questions.
08:05
And I’m like “I really don’t know because that’s not our event.” So,
08:08
that’s been really challenging.
08:10
So, has there been a way that you or the Longhouse has found a way to try
08:15
to…how do you manage that communication?
08:17
Do you have to leave little post-it’s all over the place?
08:20
You know what I mean, how do you…?
08:22
During staff meetings we usually go over the reservations.
08:26
That helps because we kind of are warned ahead of time, like what events
08:30
are coming up that are reservations.
08:34
And then I guess we kind of ask questions of what it’s about, but again,
08:37
we kind of always don’t really know.
08:39
So I guess, when we do reservations we should probably, like, ask the people
08:44
that are putting it on more about it, just like general stuff so that we know.
08:49
Thanks.
08:51
So what have been your successes working at the Longhouse?
08:55
Obviously the events that you felt really good about are successes, but
08:59
I think maybe just more generally as well if there were certain things
09:03
you thought were successes for you.
09:06
Um, I’d say
09:10
in general, just working here feels like a success, um, it makes me pretty proud
09:16
when I go back home and I tell my family and stuff what I do here at Oregon State,
09:21
it’s not just going to school, but I’ve come to, like, share my own culture.
09:24
And I know I have an uncle that, like, he’s always is excited to
09:28
hear me working at the Longhouse.
09:31
I’m just pretty proud to work here.
09:34
Good.
09:36
Let’s see, last of this grouping.
09:39
What have been your interactions from staff from the other cultural centers?
09:44
Um, let’s see…I think more like just support, like, we first had
09:53
the little retreat in the beginning so we get to know the other
09:57
staff members from other centers.
10:00
And there, like, I feel like the bond like is pretty good for the start,
10:04
and then like throughout the year we, like, will see each other know
10:08
just knowing there’s that support.
10:10
Like, we go to their events or they come to our events, and I think mostly that.
10:17
Okay, so for sure the retreat and then the specific events people show up for?
10:22
Mmm hmmm.
10:24
So then, we have a couple questions here about the new Longhouse, which
10:26
we just opened, now what, it’s been not even two weeks I think.
10:30
Has it been two weeks?
10:32
Since we’ve been open?
10:33
Well, since the grand opening of this, well I guess it’s been open since January.
10:37
I mean the grand opening in just the last couple weeks here.
10:42
So, first question along those lines.
10:44
Were you a part of the design process for the Longhouse, and if
10:47
so, if you can talk a little about
10:51
that?
10:52
I’d say sort of like, when, before the Longhouse was really built, well,
10:59
I guess in the process of it being built, like during staff meetings
11:04
be told what’s kind of going on and then we just kind of just put our input
11:07
of just tiny little things like maybe where statues should go or paintings.
11:13
Um, in that sense we’ve had a part.
11:21
As far as the actual building, maybe not so much, but I know it was pretty
11:25
cool because when my sister was working here, like I know she would talk about,
11:29
like, she actually had a part and like them coming up with the garden and how
11:33
the building should be facing and stuff, so I thought that was pretty cool.
11:37
Okay.
11:39
And then so, follow up on that, what does the new Longhouse mean to you?
11:43
That’s a big question right?
11:44
[laughs] So
11:49
maybe you can think about it, and we’re sort of looking out the window
11:52
where the old site was, so thinking about the difference between the old
11:56
one and the new one and having a new one, and what that sort of might mean
11:59
for you, especially because you were here for that transition this year.
12:05
Um, I guess it’s kind of like a new start, but we still keep a
12:09
lot of the like, obviously the memories, and like, what it means.
12:14
So, I thought that was kind of cool.
12:16
Um,
12:19
I don’t know I just [laughs]
12:24
um,
12:27
maybe you should pause it.
12:31
Okay, so
12:37
not only the new Longhouse kind of a new start but it
12:39
kind of like leaves something.
12:42
Because I know I graduate next year and like it will always be cool to
12:45
come back to Oregon State, and no matter, like, how much kind of changes,
12:50
the Longhouse will always be here.
12:52
And I know that’s kind of for my siblings as well, like, they were in
12:55
the old center, so, I mean, they won’t see that anymore, but they still,
13:00
like, feel like they kind of left something here that will always be here.
13:05
Yeah, that must be a nice thought to have when you come back here to be like,
13:09
“I was here when that thing opened.
13:10
I was the first staff that was a part of that.” That’s pretty cool.
13:17
So these next questions are about the future and sort of a larger
13:20
picture thinking about the Longhouse and the campus more broadly.
13:24
The first one is, what projects, events, or activities would you
13:28
have liked to have seen or would you like to recommend for the future?
13:31
So I’m think about some things that maybe you didn’t do or that
13:34
you wish or that you imagined what would have been really good to do?
13:40
Um, I always look for
13:44
like projects and events that like tie in everybody, because I know, like,
13:49
the Longhouse everybody thinks it’s just like native students or like
13:53
maybe they don’t feel as comfortable walking in if they’re not native.
13:57
So, like, it’s tough
13:59
because as an activities coordinator I try do this, but try to get more,
14:05
like, diversity in here or people feel comfortable about coming in
14:10
here and even if it’s an event.
14:13
I know we always try to like keep it to like Native American culture, but
14:18
sometimes I feel like just an event that doesn’t really have to do with
14:21
that would be fine because it would allow people to just come in and kind
14:25
of get used to what the center is about.
14:28
So it’s like a balance between the two, so reaching out but also working within.
14:33
Sounds like you’re looking for kind of a balance.
14:37
Yeah.
14:37
So, what advice would you give future Longhouse staff or and/or OSU
14:42
cultural center staff more generally?
14:46
Folks who might be coming into this position or reading this or listening
14:50
to this about to start their work here?
14:56
Um, for the staff, like, I’d say like obviously…the way I see the Longhouse
15:03
is like for people to come in and just kind of share their own background
15:06
culture, like, no matter what it is.
15:08
So, like for staff I know it’s kind of common like they want to share their
15:13
Native American cultures because we’re the Native American Longhouse, but I
15:16
would definitely suggest like asking people about their background even if
15:20
they are like, obviously if they are not Native American, but like I don’t
15:24
know, just make it more welcoming that it’s like for all cultures, so
15:28
that people just feel more welcome.
15:32
Based on working in the Longhouse, what is the take-away that you gained or that
15:37
you would like to share with others?
15:39
So something more like an advice that you know, someone coming in, what one
15:43
thing would you want them to know?
15:50
Or actually maybe the, or now that I’m rereading this, sorry, I’m
15:54
mucking up our interview here.
15:56
I’ll read it again, based on working at the Longhouse, what is the
15:59
take-away that you gained that you would like to share with others.
16:01
So, it sounds actually more like, what is it that you will actually bring with
16:05
you, and we talked a little bit about that with that sort of this moment, this new
16:09
beginning, but is there something else that you are taking away from your work
16:14
here, assuming that, let’s assume, I don’t know if you’re coming back next year?
16:21
Assuming that you don’t work here again, what is it that you’re going to take
16:23
with you from working with Longhouse?
16:27
Um, on the business sense of it, I’ve definitely taken away, like, just working
16:32
with the community, being able to talk to be people, being able to work around that.
16:40
Otherwise working at the NAL, I definitely
16:47
gained more appreciation of like where I come from,
16:51
because before like, obviously like,
16:57
I knew my background, like being an
16:58
Alaskan native, like, it was just something, I lived in it so it wasn’t
17:03
like that significant just because it’s my lifestyle, but coming here like
17:06
learning other people’s like, oh, wow people actually live differently and
17:10
have different cultures or whatever.
17:13
So,
17:16
I guess it just gave me more appreciation of where I come from, when I go back home
17:20
to Alaska, like when I see things that I would have not though much about, now
17:24
is like, oh wow, it has more meaning.
17:27
Or even when I see like my own people it’s like, I don’t know, it just gives me
17:31
more pride about being an Alaskan native.
17:34
Yeah, it sounds like you’ve sort of a fresh set of eyes to see…
17:36
Yeah, exactly.
17:37
To see yourself and your family, that’s great.
17:44
What is the biggest issue for you in terms of the purpose of the
17:48
Longhouse and why is it important?
17:51
The biggest issue,
17:54
it sounds to me like what’s the, I guess what’s the biggest challenge
18:01
for the Longhouse or the biggest…
18:05
Um, I think again it has to do with people thinking it’s just for Native students.
18:11
That is our goal, is to make Native students welcome, but like that’s
18:15
the goal for everything is to make everybody feel welcome here.
18:18
It’s a place people should take advantage of and use the resources, just
18:22
a comfortable place to be on campus.
18:26
So I definitely think that’s a challenge because I don’t know how many times people
18:30
come in and ask, “Is this for only Native students?” Like, “No, it’s definitely for
18:34
the whole campus and community members.”
18:38
Yeah, I know I also get a lot of folks that say I’ve never been to the Longhouse.
18:41
It’s sort of odd to me to imagine never having stepped foot inside.
18:46
I think it’s part of that same idea that they are sort of a little bit leery or
18:51
wary of whether or not they’re welcome.
18:54
How
18:58
would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on Native students,
19:01
specifically, and you can talk about yourself as you have already, but you
19:05
can also sort of speculate on how you see it impacting other Native students.
19:12
Um,
19:15
having the NAL definitely gave me, like, kind of a purpose on campus.
19:21
Like, my freshman year I didn’t go in the dorms, so I didn’t like
19:26
meet other students or anything.
19:27
So when I was on campus it was like okay, I’m just here doing classes,
19:31
but having the NAL like, that gave me a place on campus, kind
19:37
of somewhere I kind of belonged.
19:41
Also, it allows you to meet other people.
19:44
I know I met Ramsi here, like our sophomore year.
19:49
We both weren’t working here yet, but like I met her through the Longhouse
19:53
and she ended up being, like, my best friend throughout college.
19:56
So, for students that are not really clicked into the campus, it’s
20:03
definitely a place where you can…
20:08
Okay.
20:09
How would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on the OSU and the
20:13
local…I’ll reread that…how would you describe the impact of the Longhouse
20:19
on the OSU and local community?
20:21
So, stepping sort of outside just Native students, but thinking about
20:25
OSU as a whole or even the broader, sort of, Corvallis or Oregon community?
20:36
Um, I think it definitely,
20:42
like, makes OSU
20:45
and the local community kind of like more aware of the culture,
20:50
like obviously there’s tribes throughout Oregon but people might
20:53
not put much thought into that.
20:55
So having the Longhouse here kind of maybe sparks that…
21:05
[laughs]
21:06
. People are always asking, “What is that building?” It doesn’t,
21:08
architecturally, it doesn’t match anything at all [laughs] , so it definitely
21:15
peaks people’s interest it seems.
21:17
Last
21:20
two on this section, what suggestions or ideas do you have for future collaboration
21:24
with the OSU and local community?
21:26
So, things that you think, again, the Longhouse might do or do better in terms
21:31
of that connection to OSU campus more broadly or the community more broadly.
21:41
I guess we don’t do too much with the community, like whenever
21:46
we do events or anything we are focused towards the campus, which
21:50
is fine, that is kind of our goal.
21:52
But it would be cool to even like put our flyers or something not on
21:57
campus because all of our flyers, they always stay right on campus.
22:03
That would be pretty cool if we just went to local stores and were
22:05
able to put up flyers like that.
22:09
We do have some local community come to our events, but it would be
22:14
a lot cooler if we got a lot more.
22:16
Right, find a way to build that relationship a little more or something,
22:22
formally maybe it sounds like.
22:23
Yeah.
22:26
And then last question in this section, can you describe your thoughts on why
22:30
sharing your stories, and this can be your stories, or I think stories of students
22:35
like we’re doing here with the history, the oral history and the interviews, why
22:41
sharing your story individually or the story of the student staff is important to
22:46
your identity or to your Native identity?
22:52
Let’s see…I think it’s important to share like my story or anybody to
23:01
share their stories because it allows for better connection between people.
23:06
Like, you understand where they come from and kind of who they are that
23:12
allows for better understanding of
23:14
each other.
23:20
I know like, obviously I share a lot of stories of about back home in Alaska
23:23
and like people aren’t really aware of what that culture is up there.
23:28
So, just being able to share that like they get interested and I
23:32
don’t know it’s just a fun way to make people more aware I guess.
23:38
I guess I feel like, in sort of the lower 48, Alaska kind of gets left sort of out
23:45
and sometimes in terms of the stories, even within sort of Native stories.
23:51
I can imagine that could be attention or a little bit of a gap
23:56
that often gets sort of left there.
24:00
A lot of people think Alaska is the little, or the big island
24:03
near Hawaii on the maps [laughs].
24:07
Um, and so we have one bigger question here about more campus sort
24:13
of experiences, and then I’ll ask if you have anything else that you
24:17
want to add that maybe we haven’t covered or things that you want to go
24:20
back and discuss a little bit more.
24:23
So this is sort of the last question: Can you describe your experiences at
24:27
OSU pertaining to your racial or ethnic identity and/or tribal affiliation?
24:32
So how those identities
24:36
impacted your experiences here at OSU.
24:52
So, my experience at OSU coming from Alaska, like, there’s
24:57
definitely a lot more people.
24:59
With just the population of Oregon State students, that’s more than I’m
25:04
ever used to back home [laughs] . So like just having more people around and
25:10
like just the culture of it, it’s a lot different than Alaska, just even the
25:17
way people might act and even dress.
25:26
What were some of the first things that maybe struck you, are there any particular
25:29
things that you noticed right away?
25:31
Things that just struck you as odd or different or that you
25:33
realized, oh, I’m somewhere new?
25:36
I guess I don’t know, like I guess the Oregon culture I guess.
25:41
Like in Alaska we always seem to be a couple months or even years behind in
25:47
like what’s going on down in the States.
25:50
So even when it came to like the music or the way people are dressing, I noticed
25:56
its different, and then I see it happening kind of later in Alaska.
26:00
Even when it comes to like recycling, that was kind of a new thing for me
26:04
[laughs] . I was like, wow people are constantly recycling down here.
26:07
So like I know I started recycling back in Alaska now.
26:11
People think I’m weird up there [laughs] . But yeah, it was kind of culture
26:16
shock, but it’s nice because Corvallis itself isn’t a huge city, but it’s
26:23
definitely bigger than where I grew up.
26:28
Overall, I think it was a pretty good transition from
26:31
Kenai to going to school here.
26:37
Well, so the last part is just to see if you have anything else you
26:41
wanted to discuss or add or change.
26:46
Sort of an open ended opportunity for you, any last statements.
26:53
Well, I guess overall, I’m very proud to say that I’m going to be graduating next
27:00
year from Oregon State, and I definitely think that the Longhouse has made my
27:05
experience here at OSU really good.
27:08
Like I said before, I met my best friend here, it was fun to be able to
27:12
share my culture here, and just kind of have a bigger part of OSU campus.
27:19
Like I couldn’t imagine coming to school here just going to classes and getting
27:23
my degree without having the Longhouse here, like having no connection on campus
27:27
or just being able to meet more people like through the cultural centers and
27:33
like definitely with the cultural centers and just working here I’ve met a lot
27:36
of pretty people and like my experience just wouldn’t be the same without it.
27:42
Great, well, thank you so much.
