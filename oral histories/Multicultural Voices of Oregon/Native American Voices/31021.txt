00:02
My name is Natalia Fernández; I am the Oregon Multicultural Librarian,
00:06
a staff member with OSU’s Special Collections and Archives Research Center.
00:10
Today’s date is May 23, 2013, and I am interviewing Nadia Alradhi, a
00:17
staff member of the Native American Longhouse at Oregon State University.
00:22
So let’s go ahead and get started with just some basic information.
00:26
If you could state your name and spell it out loud.
00:29
Okay, so my name is Nadia Alradhi, spelled N-A-D-I-A and last name A-L-R-A-D-H-I.
00:39
And what is your hometown, or where do you consider home?
00:43
Estacada, Oregon.
00:45
Should I spell that too?
00:46
Sure.
00:46
Okay.
00:47
E-S-T-A-C-A-D-A, Oregon.
00:51
Okay.
00:52
And what your age, your year in school, and your major?
00:56
So, I’m 21.
00:58
This is my third year at OSU but credit-wise I’m a senior and
01:03
then, I’m Public Health, Health Promotion, Health Behavior.
01:08
Okay, and are you affiliated with any particular tribe or tribes?
01:12
Yeah, so I’m enrolled in the Karuk Tribe of Northern California which
01:16
is a federally recognized tribe.
01:21
Okay, well this next set of questions is about your work with the Longhouse.
01:25
So if you could state your position with the Longhouse and what you
01:29
do as well as how many years you’ve worked for the Longhouse.
01:32
So I’m an Activities Coordinator here at the NAL and it’s kind of in
01:37
the name…so I coordinate activities but I also, a large part of it is
01:42
reaching out to others, other centers and collaborating with them as well.
01:48
So you just basically you just come up with an idea for an activity and you
01:52
make it happen, so it’s really cool.
01:53
And this is my first year working for the Longhouse.
01:57
And have you worked for any of the other cultural centers on campus?
02:01
No, I have not.
02:02
So then why did you decide to work at the NAL?
02:05
So last year was my first year at OSU, 2012 was, and, oh no, I
02:11
came here in Fall of 2011, yeah.
02:16
And I was involved in Native American Student Association, after I transferred
02:21
from the community college to here and I became the secretary of the
02:26
Native American Student Association and we had our meetings in the
02:29
Longhouse, the old Longhouse, and
02:33
it’s kind of a big campus and it’s, I feel like it’s easy to get lost and
02:38
the Longhouse was really welcoming and I spent a lot of my time there anyways
02:43
so I figured I might as well apply.
02:45
And I also wanted to help bridge the gap between NASA and the Longhouse;
02:51
since I was involved in NASA and not really the Longhouse I wanted
02:55
to help bridge that gap, yeah.
02:58
So were your expectations, hopes for your work matched, surpassed, not matched?
03:05
Yeah, so they were matched, and they actually surpassed my
03:09
expectations in flexibility.
03:11
They really take into consideration that you’re a student and that’s
03:15
really nice, like if you’re like, “I need to study today” they’re, they
03:19
understand that. And, it’s matched in other places, like, flexibility again
03:28
in, “I have this idea, I want to do this” and they’re really accommodating
03:32
of that. Um, I’m trying to think.
03:36
With, with NASA I would’ve liked to see a better bridge built there
03:41
so that I guess wouldn’t be matched yet but there’s at least a starting
03:44
point for that relationship.
03:50
Okay, so you’ll probably have, a lot to talk about here, as the Activities
03:54
Coordinator, can you describe the projects, events, activities – we
04:00
can start with Fall Term and then move on to Winter and Spring – that
04:04
were especially meaningful to you or that you’d like to share?
04:06
Yeah, so Fall Term was my first term and so we get to the training in the
04:13
August and they’re like, “Okay” – oh, no, beginning of September, like, “Okay
04:17
so, what activities do you want to do?” And it’s like “Well, this is my first
04:20
time ever doing this, so do I really just get to do anything?” So, kind
04:24
of all of my first events were really meaningful ‘cause it was “my first
04:27
events” but, so I did a bow and arrow event and it didn’t get that good of
04:35
att4endance; so I think that it was important because it taught
04:38
me how to plan a successful event and so I learned from that.
04:42
And then my next event was a medicine bag making event and that was my second
04:48
event and that drew a lot more people.
04:50
And I think it’s because the location was easier to find, and the advertising
04:55
was better, and I think people actually just had genuine interest in too, not
05:01
that they didn’t for bow and arrow, but I learned from my first event.
05:06
And then another one during Fall Term that I’ll talk about was this
05:11
pumpkins in the Native American culture and that was held on Halloween.
05:16
So, I partnered with the Women’s Center and they do an international student,
05:22
like, dance almost on Halloween and it’s held in the MU Ballroom, and I
05:28
was like, well, I want to do something for Halloween because I like Halloween
05:32
and I thought well pumpkins, they’re a major staple in Native American
05:38
food so why not, bring that idea into a carving pumpkins on Halloween?
05:45
And especially international students don’t really know how to carve a pumpkin
05:49
so we actually had a couple hundred pumpkins and taught about 1000 people, we
05:56
kind of shared, how to carve a pumpkin, so that was like probably one of my
06:00
favorite events because there were so many people that didn’t really know what we
06:05
were doing, so we got to teach them that.
06:07
And we also got to teach them why pumpkins were important, and still
06:12
are, to the Native American culture.
06:14
So that was my favorite Fall Term event.
06:17
Should I just keep going?
06:18
Sure, let’s move on to Winter and Spring.
06:21
Okay.
06:23
Winter was kind of a quiet month because we moved into the new center.
06:28
So, that was a big project in itself though, so that was the highlight of
06:33
Winter Term but Winter Term was also the first time where I worked with some
06:38
of the dorms on campus and I liked that aspect of it too because sometimes when
06:44
you’re holding events, you don’t really get a lot of numbers of people coming to
06:48
your events so going to them, they kind of provide an audience for you and the
06:54
people that come are more receptive to hearing what you have to say in the first
06:57
place ‘cause they’re coming to your event.
06:59
So, Winter I went to Halsell Hall – um, what was the other one?
07:06
– Wilson Hall and then I’m working on going to Sackett and it just kind
07:10
of keeps building on top of itself.
07:13
But we so [do] dream catcher events,
07:17
and I think people like, a lot of people have dream catchers and they
07:22
don’t really know what they are.
07:23
Or they’ll put them on their car dash and have them hanging there, which is
07:26
fine, but I like being able to teach them what it means and teaching them
07:30
how to make it in an authentic way.
07:33
Oh, and then our other activities coordinator is doing one with
07:36
Weatherford, so a lot of the dorms like working with us and that was
07:39
mainly what I did with Winter Term.
07:41
Oh, and I also did – I’ll just keep going – so I also did a Finals Week
07:46
Survival Workshop and I partnered with CAPS, so I think Winter Term I
07:51
really explored partnerships because it makes planning events a lot easier.
07:56
But, I brought in a CAPS employee and a graduate student, or he’s a PhD
08:03
student, and they just kind of, we had an open discussion about, like, “What
08:09
makes you stressed during finals week?
08:10
How do you cope with that?” And the reason I did that event was because a lot of
08:15
people think that out [our] events, I mean they are supposed to be focused around
08:19
Native American culture, but I feel like, especially with this new center, people
08:23
were coming in and were saying, “Can I, like, can I be in here?” Is this only for
08:26
Native Americans?” and that was the main question I was hearing and I was like,
08:29
okay, I want to do something that opens it up to everyone where everyone can feel
08:34
welcome and it’s very obviously, I mean finals week survival, you don’t have to
08:38
be Native American to come to that. That was the last thing I did in Winter Term
08:44
‘cause I was not [omit] getting sick of people saying, “Can I be in here?” but
08:48
I wanted people to know they could be.
08:50
Yeah.
08:54
On to Spring Term?
08:55
Sure.
08:55
So Spring Term, this term, um, what have I done, let’s see.
09:00
So, this term had [has] been dominated by planning the Pow Wow
09:07
which is actually NASA’s thing.
09:10
So I’m the secretary of NASA as well, Native American Student Association, and
09:14
even though that’s not really the same thing as the Longhouse, I think they’re
09:19
closely affiliated, and we’ve, Tyler and I, we’re both in NASA and that’s
09:26
kind of taken up the most of my time.
09:28
So, is it okay if we talk about that?
09:29
Um-hmm.
09:29
Yeah?
09:30
Okay so,
09:33
that one was especially meaningful to me because I put the most time in it and I’ve
09:38
been working on it since like last Spring, since last Pow Wow, so that actually just
09:43
happened this past weekend so it’s kind of, it’s a relief to have it over with but
09:49
it’s also like really, I feel successful looking back at it because we drew, I was
09:57
talking to my mom about this, we were able to draw such a huge community together,
10:03
well it’s a small community but when we’re all together like that it feels big.
10:06
And,
10:09
I really enjoyed that.
10:10
And then I was talking to what’s-his-name, that guy I just met about the 5k we did.
10:17
That was really meaningful as well because I’m a health major, public health major,
10:21
and trying to raise awareness about, well diabetes, ‘cause Jim Thorpe’s 5k
10:27
Dash for Diabetes was really meaningful, because a lot of Native American’s live
10:33
in disease and they don’t really know how to take control of that, even though
10:36
it’s just a 5k, it’s like an event that only last for a couple hours, that
10:42
little bit of information can make a big difference and even just raising awareness
10:45
‘cause we necessarily don’t get a lot of, Native people coming to it, but we
10:50
get a lot of community members and they can learn in case they didn’t know that
10:55
this is an issue in the Native culture.
10:59
We also partnered with a lot of clubs for that event, ‘cause it’s kind
11:03
of become my baby; my sister and I work on it together because it kind
11:07
of died out and I just learned that 2003 was the last year it happened.
11:12
And so, my sister and I, when we came here in 2012, we started it again and then
11:17
this year, it like quadrupled in size, we got over 50 participants this year,
11:22
so, those are just the activities that I can think of right now [laughs] , yeah.
11:28
Okay, great.
11:29
So what have been some of your challenges, if any, working at the
11:33
Longhouse and how have you overcome them?
11:36
Hmm, um, okay, so I wrote down here, my challenges have been, coming to the
11:44
Native American Longhouse you have a bunch of different cultures within one
11:49
culture, so each tribe has their own like specifications in the way they
11:53
do things and I still don’t know my own culture of the Karuk Tribe like
11:59
100 percent through so it’s kind of challenging coming here and not being
12:04
expected, but people ask you like about this tribe specifically and you’re like,
12:08
“Well, all tribes are different” and I’m still trying to learn all of the details
12:15
of them, as many as I can at least.
12:21
So that’s been a learning process, I’d say has been one challenge.
12:25
Also being a student, I mean you have, taking classes, I’m taking like
12:31
17-18 credits and working and being a student is always a challenge, but
12:39
I’ve overcame that challenge specifically because, because
12:44
the Longhouse is so flexible.
12:47
They really work well because they know you’re a student, that’s why
12:50
you’re here in the first place.
12:53
Well, then it sounds like you’ve talked about this a little bit already
12:55
with all you’re amazing activities…
12:57
Aww, thanks.
12:58
but, what have been some of your, what you consider your
13:00
successes working at the Longhouse?
13:03
Yeah, so, I kind of did already touch on these, but I would say, hmm,
13:13
involving as many community members as I can with branching out to the
13:16
dorms and to the different centers.
13:19
Oh and we worked for the 4Cs, to do a Transforming Columbus Day event.
13:24
I really liked that one in particular because it takes this, figure in
13:32
the American culture of Christopher Columbus, he’s like this great gut
13:36
that founded America, but really, I mean people were here before him
13:39
so I like any event where I can,
13:45
transmit a message that people might not have thought of before.
13:49
So those, anytime I can do that I’m happy and I feel like most of the
13:53
time working here that’s what happens, so that’s a major success to me.
13:59
And you mentioned this a little bit with the example you gave with working
14:02
with the 4Cs but can you talk a little bit more about your interactions
14:06
with the other cultural centers?
14:08
Yeah so, the other cultural centers, it’s all been positive to me at least.
14:15
They’re really; it’s like a support system within a support system.
14:19
They, everyone’s’ honestly just really nice, like, we did a staff training
14:26
at the beginning before we all started school and that was really nice getting
14:30
to know everyone, so now when I call over to another center, I know who
14:34
I’m talking to and we actually, we all get along pretty well, at least I do
14:40
with the staff from the other centers.
14:42
Yeah,
14:45
and I think we support each other’s’ events too, which is nice, to have that
14:52
other aspect of support, level of support, it’s all about support, so yeah [laughs]
14:58
. Okay, well this next set of questions is about the new Longhouse, so were
15:03
you part of the design process of the new Longhouse or when you came had
15:08
that already been pretty much done?
15:10
Yeah, when I got here that, that was done already.
15:13
They had the blueprints up on the wall; it was pretty much all done.
15:18
So in terms of transitioning from the old Longhouse to the new one, since you
15:24
were here during the transition, what does the new Longhouse mean to you?
15:28
Hmm, ah well, it means a lot of things,
15:33
I think it shows the university’s commitment to the Native community
15:39
because Oregon has, I think Portland’s like the ninth most concentrated, urban
15:46
Native population and we have such an under representation of that here at
15:50
OSU, and I mean, I just think there’s a major disconnect there, and them
15:57
building this new center, I mean it’s beautiful, and I think it really does
16:00
show their commitment, I mean hopefully.
16:04
But it means a lot of things like we added the name “Eena Haws” at the end of Native
16:10
American Longhouse, so I think it shows,
16:17
we stayed committed to the people that worked at the Longhouse before by
16:20
keeping Native American Longhouse, but we also added “Eena Haws” because when
16:24
you’re here, everyone’s a Beaver, “Eena” means “Beaver” and I was a part of that
16:29
conversation and voting on the new name.
16:34
And I just think the Longhouse, I mean the old one was like this too but it just
16:41
formed such a sense of community, which I think is really important and you need to
16:46
keep that with you, so I could go on and on, but it means a lot of things [laughs]
16:51
. Great, so this next set of questions is about ideas for the future and sort
16:57
of the bigger picture of the Longhouse.
17:00
So what projects, events, activities, would you have liked to have seen or
17:05
would you recommend for the future.
17:09
So one major event that I was kind of disappointed to not see done was
17:13
“Calling All Natives” and it’s an event that I guess, this is my first, was
17:19
my first year so I wasn’t too familiar with it in the Fall right when school’s
17:24
starting where you get a phone list of all the people that self-identify as
17:29
Native American and Alaska Native and you personally call them and say, “We’re
17:34
just welcoming you to the campus, we have a gift basket” – I guess, they’ve done
17:39
that in the past – and I thought that was a really good idea because we are so
17:43
underrepresented we might as well reach out and it’s doable to call everyone
17:47
personally, so I really hope that that can get done next year ‘cause it didn’t
17:53
happen this year, and that’s important.
17:59
And what advice would you give future Longhouse staff or OSU
18:05
cultural staff in general?
18:07
I guess the biggest piece of advice I would give is to ask questions
18:10
because if you don’t know what’s going on, I mean, just, just ask.
18:14
And like, if you don’t know an aspect of the culture or referring to something,
18:19
this happened to me, where someone’s referring to something, where I’m just
18:22
like, “Okay, what is that?” so don’t be shy to ask questions about the
18:27
culture because that’s what you’re here to do, you’re here to learn about the
18:31
culture so that you are able to teach other people about it, definitely ask
18:37
questions would be my biggest piece of advice, yeah, for someone else.
18:42
So based on working here at the Longhouse was [what] is the takeaway or a couple
18:48
of the takeaways that you’ve gained that you’d like to share with others?
18:52
I think working at the Longhouse, the biggest takeaway that I’ve
18:58
gained is that culture, it is important, and I wish I could think
19:03
of a better word than “important” because it’s more than important, but
19:11
I think the Longhouse has taught me how to come to a new place, ‘cause
19:16
it’s away from home, and make this bond with new people that I’ve never
19:22
met before, but you become, you become close to them and Daniel always
19:28
calls us a family which, it’s kind of nice because it almost is that way,
19:36
and so I think the biggest thing I’ve taken away from this experience is
19:40
how to come to a totally new community and how to make myself a part of it
19:47
or have them welcome me into it; um, does that answer the question?
19:51
Yeah, okay.
19:52
Okay, so for you what is the biggest issue or the most important reason in terms
19:59
of the purpose of the Native American Longhouse in terms of why it’s important?
20:05
So I think the Native American Longhouse is important because, it provides a
20:11
space not only for Native students but for people that just need a place to go,
20:16
like, if I’m on campus and I think, “Oh, shoot, I need to go print that assignment”
20:21
like, I always know this is here; or if it’s, just starts to rain really hard,
20:26
I know I can come to the Longhouse and
20:31
it’s just all around important too because the people going to this college
20:36
to university should know what was here before them, like, Native Americans were
20:41
here long before they were and like, that gets lost, I mean the university’s
20:48
showing its commitment now but we were in that little Quonset Hut forever and not
20:54
many people even know what this is, so I think it’s important because people need
20:58
to remember what was here before them.
21:03
So how would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on Native students?
21:09
Well, for me personally as a Native student on OSU’s campus, it’s impacted
21:13
me because it’s made me want to learn more about it which might seem kind of
21:20
weird, but so I’m in this psychology class and we’re learning about ethnic
21:27
minorities in mainstream white societies and how when you’re in that type of
21:33
community you’re more likely to not want to embrace your ethnic background which
21:40
is - there’s this whole like psycho-social aspect about it - but I feel like that
21:47
happened to my Papa, my mom’s dad, and
21:54
he didn’t, it’s not that he didn’t embrace it, it’s just he got a lot of racism, or
22:00
discriminated against, and I could see it hurt him, and now that he’s passed my mom
22:07
has really found her native roots again and really started to connect with it and
22:12
she started to have me connect with it and, let’s see what question are we on?
22:20
How the Native American Longhouse has impact Native Students.
22:23
Oh, okay yeah, so coming here after my mom had started to reconnect, ‘cause
22:28
it’s never lost ‘cause it’s always a part of who we were but there’s been that,
22:36
discrimination that’s made him kind of shy away from it and so I don’t feel like
22:40
my mom could have learned as much as she could have, but she is a very spiritual
22:47
person and you can see that when you meet her - I mean if you ever do but - and
22:52
so it’s impacted, the Longhouse has impacted me because coming here is makes
22:57
me want to learn more and as much things as I can, like I’ll come in and there’s
23:01
something going on, I’m like, I wanna learn about that and I wanna know more
23:05
about that, and so I think that biggest impact on me and other Native students
23:10
is learning about not only your own culture, but all aspects of the culture
23:18
itself, ‘cause it’s a big umbrella.
23:21
That’s the biggest impact.
23:23
And how would you describe the impact of the Longhouse on
23:27
the OSU and local community?
23:29
I
23:32
feel like the Longhouse has attracted a lot of community members and so I
23:38
think it’s been a positive impact.
23:42
Like people will just be coming through here and they’ll be saying, “I’ve been
23:46
watching this get built online and I so happy it’s finally here!” And I mean,
23:50
Corvallis, my dad always jokes around and says, “College students and retired
23:55
people” [laughs] , and there, I mean, there is an older population that does
24:00
come through here, and they’re really excited to see this cultural center
24:05
here for them, but I have heard some negative comments which I don’t really
24:12
like to talk about, but when this first was, literally my first day here open,
24:17
so people were walking by and were like, “Well, what is this?” and I could hear
24:22
them talking and one of the girls was like, “It’s a waste of a parking lot” and
24:27
I could not believe what I was hearing, could not believe it, and I didn’t k now
24:31
what to say, you know, but you know they kept walking and we’re still here so,
24:37
that group of girls, I don’t know what to say about them, but I feel like it’s
24:44
been a positive impact other than that.
24:46
I mean there’s always going to be negativity but for the most
24:50
part the Longhouse has positively impacted OSU and the local community.
24:56
I’d like to think [laughs]
24:59
And what would be your suggestions or your ideas for future collaboration between
25:04
OSU and the local community perhaps to help bridge that gap and educate people?
25:12
Let’s see, for future collaboration between OSU and
25:15
the local community, I think,
25:21
so the Longhouse kind of feels like it’s a different culture when you come in here
25:27
and I think people are intimidated by that and maybe one collaboration could
25:32
be like with the MU, I’ve kind of reached out to the Memorial Union president,
25:39
I don’t remember her name right now, but she’s really, she’s really nice and
25:42
they get a lot of exposure, so working with groups on campus that get a lot of
25:48
exposure is what I would suggest because we want this to be a bigger thing, like
25:56
we want it to grow and in order to do that you have to work with people that
26:02
get a lot of exposure, and I wish it wasn’t like that but you need to know
26:05
how to, how to make something grow and I think that’s the best way to do that.
26:11
The other future collaborations would be,
26:18
anything that kind of makes people want to come I guess; like things
26:21
that are interesting and things that might not have been done before.
26:23
That’s a good one, because sometimes you get in a rut doing the same thing
26:27
over and over, but bringing new ideas in, is awesome and I think working
26:32
and collaborating with OSU or the community can bring in new ideas too.
26:37
Okay.
26:39
And can you describe your thoughts on why sharing your stories is
26:43
important to your identity, if it is?
26:45
Yeah, so, actually when I first heard about this idea, I was like, I don’t like
26:49
to – I mean I like to talk obviously but [laughs] I get kind of shy sometimes,
26:58
but I think it’s important because the Native American saying “Every decision
27:04
we make, let us think about the seventh generation ahead of us” and so by having
27:11
this recorded and having this shared with sharing my own stories, maybe someone,
27:17
who knows, in like a hundred years from now, needs to know what was happening
27:21
here a hundred years ago and they can look back at this and they’ll be able to see
27:28
other people’s stories.
27:29
And let’s see, it’s important to my own identity because kind of that saying
27:35
I said, as a Native American we like to think about our future generations
27:40
and that’s kind of my identity as a whole, and it works into the future
27:47
generations as well, but who doesn’t want to be remembered, you know?
27:52
That too, so yeah.
27:54
Okay, so if you’d like can you describe your experiences at OSU pertaining to
28:03
your identity, your Native identity?
28:06
Yeah, so there’s been positive and negative, kind of mentioned
28:10
the negative one earlier.
28:12
But
28:16
when I’m like in class even, as a Public Health major we’ll talk about,
28:22
let’s see, health disparities in minorities, and we’ll use Native
28:28
Americans and they always talk about diabetes and I think, and alcoholism,
28:34
also they talk about that a lot.
28:36
And I’ll always make a point that you know fry bread and all this fatty food
28:40
that is put on the reservations is not, it’s not native to the Natives.
28:47
So it was out there and that’s what they were given and they had to
28:50
eat it if they wanted to survive so I’ll make that point in my classes,
28:56
so that’s been an experience that I’ve had while here at OSU is,
29:01
the people, they don’t like to blame Native Americans for being obese or
29:08
why does this population have such an increased rate of diabetes but I’ll
29:13
just, I mean, they’re not, they don’t really know, I feel that they don’t
29:17
know the whole story so I let them know [laughs] . And I always make a point
29:22
to do that because it’s not, it’s not the right story that they’re getting.
29:33
But there are lots of positive things too, of course, there’s
29:36
always positive, especially with
29:41
Joe Burton being here for the basketball team, I think a lot of people feel,
29:46
like the N7 shirts, people think that’s cool or they think that’s, like, I
29:52
want that shirt but they want to know the meaning behind it too, or I want
29:56
them to know the meaning behind it too.
29:59
So I think just seeing those N7 shirts when people walk by, it’s
30:02
like, it’s a positive thing, ‘cause it’s like, your raising awareness
30:05
even if you don’t know that you are,
30:09
but they’ve been positive more than negative but I feel like the negative
30:14
ones kind of stick out a little bit.
30:17
But
30:20
the new Longhouse though has been amazing, so I’m just so happy it’s here, so there’s
30:27
a lot of experiences I could talk about.
30:29
And so would perhaps say that you see yourself as an advocate?
30:37
Is that something that you enjoy doing or do you feel that you have to?
30:41
Or is it a mix of both?
30:43
Yeah, I think, and I don’t want to make myself sound like a rebel student that
30:48
just [laughs] or anything like that but I do feel like an advocate because we
30:53
are so underrepresented on campus and maybe even if you do come here, I wasn’t,
31:00
I didn’t live on a reservation, but if you do come here from a reservation
31:03
or if you do, Native culture is, your kind of soft spoken, you don’t, I
31:13
mean you don’t like to interrupt or any of that but you know if it needs to be
31:19
done, I’ll do it because it’s, it needs to be heard, and I feel like, I mean
31:25
there’s, there’s this one other Native person in my class and I know, I asked
31:29
him like afterwards, one class, “Are you Native?” and it’s just kind of like that
31:34
connection, it’s there before you even know the person but I guess I’d like
31:40
to think of myself as an advocate, yeah
31:45
[laughs]
31:45
. Okay well, is there any other additional information that you’d like to share
31:50
that we haven’t discussed or is there anything that you’d like to go back to
31:54
that we’ve talked about and share more?
31:56
Hmm,
31:59
not that I can think of.
32:00
Okay, well, so just as a little extra follow up, I’m interested if you could
32:05
share just a little bit about the Native American Student Association and how
32:11
you see its mission and the Longhouse mission and how you see those intersecting
32:19
or how you see them as different?
32:21
Yeah, um, yeah, can I clear one thing up, so regarding the me speaking out in
32:27
class, yeah because so, we’re learning like, what they teach you is you know
32:32
Native Americans have x, y, z rates of diabetes and then we move on but
32:37
they don’t say like what’s behind that so I like to make sure people know.
32:42
Yeah, so that’s why I do that, it’s they don’t tell you why they just
32:45
tell you the facts and health is all about prevention so why not?
32:49
I mean they do, they show some films but yeah so I feel like
32:55
sometimes they try to skip over it.
32:57
Yeah, so bridging the gaps between NASA and Longhouse,
33:00
can you repeat the question?
33:02
Can you sort of describe as what you see are the similarities and
33:08
differences between the two in terms of their missions and their purposes?
33:12
Yeah, so our missions and purposes, I feel like they’re pretty much in
33:17
line with each other but there is a divide between, from what I understand,
33:23
what I’ve heard is NASA and the Longhouse used to work really closely,
33:29
but that kind of went away, I don’t really know when.
33:32
But now they are just two totally different, and I feel like, so I came
33:39
here and I was first involved with NASA and then I was always in the longhouse
33:44
and I was like “Why, why is it like this? Why aren’t we the same thing?
33:50
‘Cause we’re already such a small group, why divide it even further?” and so I’ve
33:56
been trying, like becoming an employee here, I was like, okay, I’m going to work
34:01
here to make the Pow Wow even better and I’m gonna do this and that, I had wild
34:06
dreams, but I think that even they’re coming up with some new job descriptions
34:13
and a new position I believe, possibly, so I think was [one] of those new ones
34:21
should really be focused on rebuilding that relationship with NASA because it’s
34:25
kind of gone and it’s hard coming here and there’s a wealth of knowledge in the
34:30
Longhouse the NASA could really benefit from that we do use but I feel like
34:37
the effort, it shouldn’t, it shouldn’t be that hard to just kind of, they
34:42
should work together and that’s that.
34:45
And just as a follow up, do you notice that in your experience, so people
34:51
choose one or the other and in your case you decided to try and bridge the gap?
34:56
Or is it common for people to participate in both?
34:59
Yeah so everyone who works at the Longhouse is technically a member of
35:05
NASA but they don’t necessarily come to all the meetings or help with the
35:11
events, or you know like on Facebook they’ll be a member but they don’t
35:18
help out as much as I would like to be honest and
35:24
so yeah, I was working here or I was with NASA and I was
35:28
like well, why is it like this?
35:32
What can I do?
35:33
Well I can work at the Longhouse and also be the secretary of NASA I think that will
35:39
really help bridge the gap and I wrote we had like reviews of our job descriptions
35:44
and I wrote in it someone should be in charge of working with NASA and I wrote
35:50
that in my job description but I don’t think anything really came from it so.
35:55
So maybe you recommend, like you made a recommendation for next year…
35:58
Yes!
35:59
That would be a major recommendation, is don’t let NASA go away, like don’t,
36:03
‘cause they, we are really small club.
36:05
I think the Longhouse only had [has] like nine or ten employees but NASA only
36:11
has like five or six and pretty much all of us are graduating so I’m kind of
36:15
worried about it to be honest so next year people should really try to reach out
36:23
and help as much as they can because we really are here for the same
36:27
reason, might as well work together.
36:30
Okay, well great, well other than that, unless there’s
36:33
something you’d like to add?
36:35
Just thank you for doing this.
36:37
Well, thank you so much I really appreciate it.
36:40
Yeah, thank you.
36:43
So just as a little follow up to the distinction between NASA and the NAL
36:48
can you describe a little about the positives as why you see that it’s
36:53
important to keep these two entities separate and yet work together?
36:59
Yeah so,
37:03
I think it’s important for NASA to stay its own club and the Longhouse to stay
37:09
its own entity separate from NASA because if you combine the two then you lose
37:18
the club aspect of NASA and it’s kind of nice just being able to pop in for a
37:23
meeting really quick if you have to go and like if you work for the Longhouse
37:28
you’re technically an employee so I don’t really know if they could just be
37:33
a club member of a place where people are working so that would kind of get
37:38
lost and be really sticky and I think ‘cause, the Longhouse it does house NASA
37:45
and it does provide a space to store some of our stuff, and the staff members
37:49
do, I mean they do help out but I think
37:55
the gap should be bridged so when you are hired, it shouldn’t be like an expectation
38:02
to work with NASA but something should be done where NASA’s not so lost.
38:07
Because last year was my first year on campus and they’re like, “Do you want
38:11
to be president of this club?” and it’s like, “Well I don’t even know what I’m
38:14
doing here” so it’s a positive keeping them separate for sure because you want
38:21
to keep that club feeling and it’s not so strict it’s not so formal but it’s nice
38:27
to also have the Longhouse being separate, but they should also work together.
38:31
It’s like a weird, long story.
38:34
Okay, great, thanks for the follow up.
38:36
Yes.
