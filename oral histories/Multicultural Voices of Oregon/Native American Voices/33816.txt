00:00
Okay, this is Ed Walkinstik-Man-Alone.
00:06
What year were you born, Ed?
00:09
Well it depends which birth certificate you look at.
00:11
The uh, one from the rez or the one from the United States government.
00:16
I have to go by the one from the U.S. government so it would be July 14,
00:22
1938, which makes me five years younger.
00:27
[laughing]
00:28
I understand your name was Wonder.
00:30
Can you explain that.
00:34
Yeah the de-Indianization program of the 1930's --1920's and 30's-- were
00:39
young Indians were taken from the reservation and shipped a good distance
00:43
away, and put in what were fondly referred to as "Government Indian
00:48
schools", and taught to be white.
00:51
They were stripped of everything that they ever were to know about
00:58
being - what they were - who they were.
01:02
Uh, while I was in the schools, we learned a rather cruel lesson about
01:09
this quote "Nation under God" that our teachers, Christian as they were, were
01:17
directed to do one thing - and that was to mentally and physically abuse us any
01:21
way they could until we became white.
01:24
We were stripped of our names, our identities, we were not
01:28
allowed to utilize our language.
01:32
Any thought or any mention of any Indian tradition, ceremony or anything like
01:37
that, you were physically beaten for it.
01:41
So uh, it was a, it was total brain-washing process.
01:45
Now this is the idea, like I said, to make us white.
01:48
What they did, was make us better Indians!
01:51
It pretty much backfired, because excuse the expression, even at
01:56
that age it pissed a lot of us off!
01:58
Uh, we were not white, and we still are not white, and we don't want to be white.
02:04
I mean the little bit of white blood I had in my veins right now I find an insult.
02:12
I mean, you know yeahch.
02:13
You know, it's like them thinking they had a little black blood in
02:17
their veins you know, they would die of hydrophobia or something.
02:22
But uh, now it was just total stripping of one's culture.
02:28
And it still goes on today, except that the schools are not as physically
02:34
brutal, but they are as mentally brutal.
02:40
I didn't realize that.
02:41
Oh yeah.
02:42
The schools still exist, in fact there's one just about, oh
02:44
forty or fifty miles from here.
02:45
Chemawa.
02:47
And regardless of what you want to say, you know they say "Great
02:50
Indian School," and everything else.
02:52
Well you should get up there, and look at the inner politics
02:56
of that school, it is still run by the "Bureau of Idiotic Asses".
03:00
You know, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which unfortunately are a necessary evil.
03:06
They're the only thing between us and extinction.
03:10
Okay?
03:11
But they are our absolute dictator, providing we want to carry their card.
03:18
I refuse to carry it, the card, and I refuse to even register.
03:23
My family never registered, anything else when they moved the families
03:28
back in the 1830's - we're part of the Trail of Tears - the Choctaw lived
03:33
and navigated the Mississippi River from the Gulf of Mexico all the way
03:36
up to the Great Lakes; they were the largest tribe east of the Mississippi.
03:43
Uh,
03:50
in fact the Choctaw were the ones that taught both the French and the
03:53
British and all others that came over to navigate the Mississippi.
03:57
They're the ones that set up the trade routes on the Mississippi River.
04:02
So in case the anthropologists want to know how, say, quote "something
04:06
that was supposed to be up there got down there", very simple.
04:11
It's very possibly the Choctaw or one of the river tribes, had brought
04:14
it down, off the old trade routes.
04:18
Where were you raised?
04:23
Uh, raised.
04:24
[chuckle] That's kind of a cute word.
04:27
Uh, an Indian doesn't get raised.
04:30
He gets beaten up.
04:32
You know, or beaten down.
04:34
It was six of one, half a dozen of another.
04:37
Uh, no we were thrown up, and we were thrown up in government schools,
04:43
and when those became unpopular, we wound up in cotton cottages, and then
04:49
in orphanages, I finally wound up in an orphanage down in California.
04:52
Down in California?
04:55
Yeah.
04:55
Sacramento.
04:57
And uh, like I said, it wasn't a pretty sight all the way down the line.
05:02
Uh, a rather interesting anecdote, there was a young lady that, uh,
05:09
came from the same reservation I did.
05:11
Uh,
05:14
well, when we - first time we entered the government school; in fact I had a
05:18
paper around here that I'll dig up for you, it's called "America's First Pool",
05:22
that I wrote a number of years ago.
05:25
Anyway, the young lady, I won't give her name cause - in honor of her rest
05:33
- was, uh, promptly raped the second day she was there by the so-called
05:40
"Christian" teacher.
05:42
I mean brutally raped!
05:44
And uh, nothing she could do about it, this -you know, what
05:47
did an Indian have to say?
05:48
Didn't amount for anything, you know, equivalent to what a Black had to say, or
05:52
what a Black still has to say, Mexican- American, or Polynesian, you know.
05:56
It was the white over the Polynesian, always taught that, always first up.
06:01
So uh, this is just a quick synopsis, but anyway, when they closed down Argum
06:11
[?] School, which is up further north of here,
06:16
in fact it became a Japanese internment camp, during World War Two.
06:21
We were sent on to cotton cottages and then to the orphanage in Sacramento.
06:26
We were promptly informed at the orphanage in Sacramento that, uh, in order to be
06:33
part of the society, uh, that we would promptly have to become Christians.
06:36
Attend the Christian church, on the threat of beating.
06:42
She promptly committed suicide.
06:44
She said she'd rather be dead than Christian.
06:48
So, it's kind of rather a sore anecdote going back, but this
06:53
is, this is still going on.
06:57
One of the problems is that, uh, the wechecho, the white person out here,
07:02
does not understand traditional life.
07:05
Is not really interested in traditional life.
07:08
They're interested in filling their books up with, you know snatches of
07:10
what they get, and what they like.
07:11
You know, for a-what do you call it, romantic [?] issue, but to get down to
07:19
the nitty-grittys uh, I often question it because I've seen too much of what I know
07:27
is true - changed in the white writings.
07:31
That's why you notice on the release I signed for you that reads "shall
07:35
not be taken out of context nor shall the meaning of any of it
07:37
be changed" of what I've said.
07:40
Otherwise - no, you can't have it!
07:43
There are certain things I can't even talk about, because
07:47
they're forbidden.
07:48
By the white man?
07:48
No.
07:49
By our heritage.
07:52
They're you know, ceremonies, or thoughts, groups, societies
07:58
amongst Native Americans.
08:00
You have 'em amongst Polynesians.
08:03
Things that you do not discuss.
08:05
They're like private societies, within a society.
08:08
So everything is not open to what we call the wachecho.
08:13
This, number one they're incapable of comprehending it in the first
08:17
place, otherwise they wouldn't be turning around and stuffing a
08:20
multitude of different religions down our throat when we've had one for
08:23
25,000 years that worked just fine!
08:27
And the same thing again.
08:29
You go to the Islands, the religion there was beautiful.
08:33
But it was "wrong", see?
08:38
[both laughing] But anyway, where was I?
08:43
It's,
08:46
well anyway - the thing I'm aiming at is just that the white person
08:50
does not understand cultural shock!
08:54
And even to this day, you see, I'm still going through it.
08:58
Look at me - I'm nearly fifty years old, on my one birth certificate.
09:04
Uh, but I still
09:10
cannot fathom the double standard out there.
09:13
That we are called citizens, but uh, we're not!
09:18
We're things!
09:20
We
09:24
remain the brunt of sneers, jokes, uh, second-class position.
09:31
In fact, in most cases, third class
09:35
position.
09:35
The laws are not equal, anybody of another colored element, the laws are not equal
09:42
whatsoever, and that I can prove to you.
09:45
There's a box on the other side of the wall there and
09:48
a pile of paper right there.
09:50
I'm in year seventeen right now, just, what do you say, getting my
09:55
rights and benefits for an injury suffered seventeen years ago through
10:00
the United States government.
10:03
Well, twenty-two years in court to get my name back should be rather interesting!
10:07
You know, weiho can go down and change theirs tomorrow, you know.
10:13
Really don't even have to give a reason.
10:17
What brought you back to the east coast from when you lived in California?
10:22
I know you lived in North Carolina?
10:24
Yeah, it was in - well, I've lived all over the United States.
10:28
In fact, all over the world.
10:30
But uh, North Carolina, what brought me to North Carolina is that the Solar
10:36
Chariot, it's a motor home that I built, actually a class-room on wheels that
10:41
taught appropriate technology, alternative forms of appropriate technology, such
10:46
as solar, wind, bio-fuels - that's making fuel out of alcohol - moonshine
10:53
- okay, I was teaching people how to build all their own equipment, how
10:57
to recycle, how to how to survive, basically, without the use of money.
11:03
And, uh, that particular motor home went 571,000 miles in seven years.
11:10
Was totally unfunded.
11:14
It was all done on bartering.
11:16
Forty-seven round trips across the United States the hard way.
11:19
You'll find it in Mother Earth News, issue fifty-three- "Ed Walkinstik,
11:24
Hope, and the Amazing Solar Chariot".
11:26
But anyway, our job primarily is going to rural, poor areas.
11:32
To teach!
11:32
And it was all, like I said, done by bartering.
11:36
How do you charge somebody that is already so far down in the hole that, you know,
11:42
the only thing that will help 'em is help.
11:46
You don't come in there and take the last thing they have!
11:50
No matter how minimal it is.
11:52
Well, this is a concept in which the white person out here cannot understand.
11:56
They talk a lot about it, you know, "Help thy neighbor" etc. All this, but uh,
12:03
they'll help their neighbor, and they will find out which pocket it's in and get it!
12:10
Uh - that was primarily what the chariot was.
12:14
Educational tool - hands on - right on the spot, we taught people
12:19
how to build their own things.
12:20
How to do this; How to organic garden.
12:23
Herbology -for medicine purposes, stuff like that.
12:27
See I'm of a medicine family.
12:30
Our family were herbalists.
12:34
Herbal shamanics.
12:36
I learned about that today.
12:37
The medicine man.
12:39
Yeah, well see, they turn around and say "medicine man", but do they
12:43
make a distinction between whether he's a herbalist, or a spiritualist?
12:47
Or is he both?
12:47
They,
12:51
uh, where I come from, you had a spiritualist Medicine Man,
12:56
dancer - rattle shaker, quick way to define it in the English word,
13:00
cause there's no translation in our language, to the English word for it.
13:04
And then you had the herbalist who administered, uh,
13:08
different herbal concoctions.
13:12
Alright, that's where the name Walkinstik comes from.
13:17
Or the word Dubdehono.
13:21
It does not mean somebody with a cane.
13:24
Walkinstik's a little animal.
13:27
Looks like a ferret, or like a marmot.
13:32
Maybe I can think of a better one.
13:34
Like a little otter.
13:36
Okay.
13:37
That used to lead the
13:41
people to the healthful herbs; where they grew when the animal was ill, and
13:48
they would watch what the animal did.
13:49
And they would utilize those herbs.
13:53
Then they started watching other animals and everything else, but a Walkinstik is
13:56
the, in lots of tales it is the one that introduced the Elders to the medicines.
14:03
So-
14:04
That's interesting.
14:05
Okay.
14:07
So we're named after the animal, even though, but we're not
14:11
of - but that animal is not a clan.
14:14
We're of the Bear Clan.
14:16
You've seen me frequently wear a necklace with the bear claws on it.
14:19
The Bear Clan ring.
14:22
Okay now the Bear Clan, uh - clans are families; more or less Bear
14:27
Clan cannot marry Bear Clan.
14:31
Wolf Clan cannot marry Wolf Clan.
14:33
Snake Clan cannot marry Snake Clan.
14:35
Snipe cannot marry Snipe; goes right on down the line.
14:37
Eagle can't marry Eagle.
14:41
Really the same thing as marrying your cousin.
14:43
Okay.
14:44
Or your sister.
14:45
You know.
14:48
Oooooooo.
14:49
But Clan can inter-marry, and hopefully like to marry up.
14:55
More or less, Bear Clan is considered, by the white standard I guess, and
15:00
I guess in the Indian standard, Bear Clan, say, is above Fox Clan.
15:05
But, uh, only in the idiom
15:09
of size-comparative analysis.
15:13
Actually, no, the Fox clan has its distinct element, which
15:18
does not exist in the Bear Clan.
15:20
The Bear Clan has its distinct element, which does not exist in the Eagle Clan,
15:24
or the Fox Clan or any other clan.
15:26
They have their own ceremonies, their own traditions, and everything else.
15:29
Just like all families.
15:32
You know, all families are different even though they come together.
15:36
Uh, even though Indian life,
15:40
how do you say - I even hate the word Indian.
15:42
That came from Columbus, and that poor slob never even landed on the shores here!
15:50
The word Indian is a-is-isn't-is not Indian.
15:56
No.
15:56
We're
15:57
- What would you liked to be called?
15:58
Native American?
15:59
Native American, preferably.
16:00
Yes.
16:02
Because we are the first Americans, we are the original Americans.
16:08
Yes.
16:08
And I would say that those indigenous to this land, and those forced over here,
16:15
to be enslaved on this land, probably have more right to this land than
16:19
those who claim this land as, um, their sovereign you know spot in the world.
16:25
More or less, not to be non-patriotic, I believe that, uh, what has happened,
16:32
and what is still going on is um...
16:38
What's a good word for it, without being too offensive?
16:41
Uh, derogative.
16:46
Very derogative.
16:48
Very inhuman.
16:50
Example, not one treaty has been kept, so white man has no honor.
16:58
I mean he's already proven that.
16:59
He, you can stand here and just watch his honor hobble down every day.
17:04
Just hobble down like, like an old broken-down old man There is no honor.
17:11
His honor is in what he can get his hands on.
17:13
How fast he can get his hands on it, and how much he's got in his pocket.
17:17
And, you know, whose wife can he trick.
17:22
But his thing is, you know, well he's macho da-da-da!
17:26
And in Native American life - No.
17:28
Uh, Native American life you gotta remember that a great number of
17:32
the, uh, tribal associations are matriarchal, not patriarchal.
17:37
And I like the matriarchal aspect of it because there's just better balance.
17:42
Much better balance.
17:44
Of course uh, the women have the upper hand in this element, which is great
17:47
- more or less, divorce is very simple.
17:50
If you blew it, she just took your moccasins and stick 'em outside the door!
17:54
And, she's saying basically, "You're lucky to go with those!"
18:00
And there was no recourse.
18:02
Nobody else in the tribe'd intervene.
18:06
Alright.
18:06
Uh, you see this, very, very much even to this day uh, particularly
18:11
down in the Southwest with the Navajo, and the Zuni and the Hopi.
18:14
And the, uh, Pima.
18:17
Particularly with the Navajo, which are the-right now being totally abused.
18:22
Thoroughly abused!
18:24
Uh, they, they trump up this thing at Big Mountain, saying that the Hopi and
18:27
the Navajo are fighting, which is a crock of - excuse the expression - shit.
18:31
I worked there!
18:34
I spent a lot of time in those areas!
18:36
All round Cameron, Tube City, that area there.
18:39
And no they're not fighting each other!
18:41
That's another Hollywood ploy because vested interests want to strip mine
18:46
that, just like they did Black Mesa.
18:49
Those lands are sacred!
18:51
That's a church.
18:51
Is that the, the Navajo tribe - is that the one, the government
18:59
is taking them off the land?
19:00
Nearly 11,000 of them, Nearly 11,000 of them are being forcibly removed.
19:04
In fact, in about four days.
19:09
And the other thing that's coming up is the, uh, they're talking
19:13
about making them pay for it!
19:16
The Navajo!
19:16
Well, you people - uh, not you,
19:21
the American taxpayer, which I guess is us, has already paid millions
19:27
and millions and millions of dollars for this relocation program.
19:31
"Relocation program".
19:36
Well, "relocation", say, in 1833 through 1936 was called the Trail of Tears.
19:41
Okay.
19:43
And has accomplished nothing!
19:46
Absolutely nothing, other than destroying a very ancient, sacred way of life!
19:53
It's genocide.
19:56
Which, by all international treaties on this earth - is illegal!
20:04
It's a direct violation with the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty, signed with Mexico, when
20:11
Mexico ceded their rights to specific parts of the United States, particularly
20:16
that of the Southwest - Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California.
20:23
It's in direct violation, because the Treaty states politically
20:26
that the indigenous of that area, shall remain in that area.
20:29
And be un- you know - untampered, unmoved,
20:34
not stripped of what is sacred.
20:37
Now this nations sits here - you get on TV, on any day of the week
20:43
here, and you can hear Jerry Falflat on TV, Jerry Falwell, you know-
20:48
[Giggling]
20:48
Gimme, gimme, gimme, you know.
20:51
Who's the other one?
20:52
Rogers or somebody.
20:53
Anyway, all these TV prophets.
20:57
[cough]
20:59
And I'm not sure how you spell that.
21:00
Is it p-r-o-p-h-e-t, or p-r-o-f-i-t?
21:04
[Laughing]
21:05
Uh, turning around and saying, "Well the only way to heaven is uh,
21:09
through your paycheck" You know.
21:13
"Stick with us, kick in a few bucks, and we'll make sure you get there."
21:23
People have got to go down - they've got to go look - they've got
21:29
to go down, understand the simplicity of this form of life.
21:33
The beauty of it.
21:35
My god, you think they've got laws out here?
21:40
Tribal law is mind boggling!
21:43
I mean there are taboos left and right!
21:46
There are do's and don'ts left and right that make the so-called weho-wachecho laws
21:52
uh, akin to something out of kindergarten!
21:59
But the laws are sacred.
22:01
And then to have this, this,
22:05
un-formed fool walk into societies that are in excess of 25,000 years old and
22:12
tell them they're doing it all wrong!
22:16
When their society hasn't even reached the first thousand years!
22:21
It doesn't make sense.
22:26
It just, you know...Who are they?
22:30
What are they doing here?
22:33
Kind of reminds me of this cartoon I always have in my mind.
22:36
It shows two Indians standing up on a hill overlooking the rock at Plymouth,
22:40
and the boys getting off the ship there.
22:41
Standing on the shore talking, you know.
22:43
The other Indian is pushing the other one-turned around saying - "Aw let
22:45
'em alone! What harm can they do?"
22:50
[both laughing] Isn't that ironic?
22:52
But uh, now - it doesn't make any sense!
22:58
Uh
23:01
- the labeling, everything else they do.
23:04
Well, you've seen the labeling?
23:09
I had one wonderful experience talking with young lady, a Māori from
23:14
New Zealand, here, and uh, I think we've learned well from the white
23:20
about one thing - about labeling.
23:22
I think in Hawaii, they call a white a hoale.
23:26
Uh, we call them [unclear] - "white spiders".
23:31
[both chuckle] They spin a web - tie the Indian by the
23:34
feet - see, so he starves to death.
23:37
And then uh, the Māoris, down in New Zealand they call them pākehā.
23:45
And uh, about the best way to translate that is uh, something like uh, what is it?
23:51
Something like - just a minute, I gotta think of the word.
23:55
Uh, oh a "bureaucracy of a different color".
24:02
[Laughing] It was the closest, the closest that I could
24:10
think of pākehā.
24:10
I think it's probably the best translation that I could think of.
24:13
The "bureaucracy of a different
24:23
color".
24:31
Why did you decide to come to Oregon?
24:35
I suffer from, uh, what do you call it?
24:40
I don't sweat.
24:43
Well - and being in the South, as hot and humid as it was, I couldn't
24:47
even go outside during the day.
24:50
Okay.
24:50
For me, getting away, out of that, heat down there like that is fatal.
24:55
So we, I was raised here in the Northwest when I was a child,
24:59
and I've always loved it.
25:00
Took me thirty years to get back here.
25:03
And I always managed to, you know, survive in this area.
25:07
I'm surviving very well in this area.
25:08
I can actually go outside during the summer time, and
25:10
you know, that's a rare treat!
25:13
After sitting in a bathtub for six years.
25:17
[laughs] Yeah - sitting in a cold bathtub during the summer
25:19
-that gets to be a real drag!!!
25:21
I mean after six years, you come out looking like a -you know,
25:24
a really dilapidated prune!
25:28
You ever sat in a tub for a long time?
25:29
Well alright - you try it for eight to twelve hours a day, for three months.
25:37
Okay.
25:39
Well, that, it's a long story but you know, to heck with it.
25:42
I don't sweat.
25:44
I'm learning to sweat again, now that I'm back out here.
25:48
I'm not being bombarded uh, by the uh, the consistent heat that you have down there.
25:55
You know, the Carolinas and that area there were you know,
25:57
you get a-hundred, hundred and three, hundred and four degrees.
26:01
And 97% humidity!
26:05
I mean, I've spent some time over in Hawaii - I've never seen
26:09
that type of humidity in Hawaii!
26:11
I have in Panama!!
26:13
You know.
26:15
And down in Pago Pago, yes.
26:17
But uh, you know, and throughout the South Pacific, but nothing like
26:23
what's in the Carolinas, and Georgia and - Oh and also, eastern Texas,
26:30
like down around Corpus Christi.
26:31
You don't breath in the air - you drink it!
26:36
It's almost thick enough to cut.
26:38
But no - it took years to get enough money to get back out here!
26:42
But I got back out here again!
26:45
I have no intention of leaving unless I go, you know, go back overseas.
26:52
There are some places overseas that I would very very definitely
26:58
would reconsider living again.
26:59
Japan's one of them.
27:02
I spent two and a half years there, and probably two and a half of the
27:05
most beautiful years of my life.
27:09
There, and in Sweden.
27:14
Uh, I wouldn't mind living in Germany for a while.
27:16
I don't know if I want to live there continuously!
27:21
And, uh, New Zealand - I would, you know, providing it would be somewhere around
27:28
the Māoris.
27:29
Māoris, Māoris [changes pronunciation slightly] , depends
27:32
on whose saying it to you.
27:32
The Kiwis down there call them the Bloody Ories!
27:35
[both laugh] Of course, the Māoris turn on them - call them the dumb Kiwis.
27:41
I know you're an educated man.
27:43
Uh, I know you're intelligent.
27:45
You're a 4.0 student.
27:47
What are you studying?
27:49
Which time?
27:52
This - Now.
27:54
Alright I just left the field of industrial technology, 'cause I've gone
27:59
just about as far as I can in it, and I'm now looking at educational media,
28:07
which would be under the Liberal Arts program umbrella.
28:10
More or less going through three different, uh, what do you call it?
28:17
Concentrations.
28:18
To form one degree.
28:20
And I'll finish up my baccalaureates in that.
28:22
And then I will probably continue on, in the same field, through the School
28:27
of Education, and my Master's program.
28:30
So uh, see I'm not looking at uh, at the uh, program that is offered
28:37
there - in Educational Media, cause that's only for, you know, grade school
28:42
and high school - stuff like that.
28:43
My interest lies after high school.
28:46
More or less for secondary.
28:48
I'm interested in people, uh, adults, like myself, that have been injured,
28:57
and lost their jobs, been out of work, like me for seventeen years!
29:02
And have spent seventeen years trying to get a baccalaureate's [sic] degree.
29:06
I've spent what, uh, three of those years in school, and the rest in court.
29:16
And this was a guarantee that when I was injured that I would be
29:18
retrained, and I'd be put back to work!
29:21
I was formerly employed by the United States government.
29:24
Hm, gee what a coincidence!
29:25
Them again!
29:27
[laughing] Oh - everything'd be all taken care - and all this other stuff!
29:32
I will not go into the details of what has been taken care of - we
29:36
could write a book on that!
29:38
But, uh, excuse the expression -I have been scheiße-ed.
29:42
Screwed, uh, cheated,
29:48
berated,
29:51
insulted
29:55
- and I could think of a lot of other adjectives or verbs whichever you
29:59
want that would describe exactly what it is to uh, deal with the,
30:06
with these government so-called Vocational Rehabilitation program.
30:12
Uh, you're better off going out and living with the bears.
30:17
Eat your food out of a log like they do!
30:21
Because, uh, they don't keep their word.
30:25
They don't know how to keep their word.
30:33
I find very few white people that I can stand face-to-face with.
30:37
I'd rather stand, and look at 'em sideways!
30:41
More or less, I want to be out of the way, in case they throw more bullshit!
30:45
Mm-hm.
30:47
How do you - You have kids, right?
30:50
None of my own.
30:51
The only child I had, a little boy, died in 1980.
30:58
But I've raised nine children.
31:01
These are children that, uh,
31:04
well, like these two that I have here.
31:09
Now she was left stranded out in the middle of nowhere, in Texas, with
31:14
two toddlers, and absolutely nothing!
31:17
Now she's got guts.
31:20
And uh, well she pulled herself up by her bootstraps.
31:25
I, I like a fight!
31:26
I can't stand these people that sit back - Woe is me!
31:30
You know?
31:32
They gotta go forward, and say hey I ain't gonna buy it.
31:37
That ain't the way the law is written.
31:39
But uh, I've been with her now - six years.
31:47
And I've watched two very, very confused, very small children grow
31:52
into some, probably some of the most respected children in town right now.
32:00
And we constantly get comments on their manners and everything else.
32:06
But we also get a little response back every now and then, on what do you call
32:15
a - racial - indifference, as far as - particularly in the Mormon community.
32:25
Uh,
32:28
we've had the kids come home occasionally and you know, crying - they were
32:35
insulted for their Indian-ness.
32:38
They didn't think like, uh, quote "the Mormons did".
32:42
Of course the Book of Mormon turns around and coldly quotes that the
32:47
Indian is a filthy race, and godless!
32:51
And the only way they can redeem themselves, is become Mormon.
32:56
[laughing] It never ends!
32:59
So I, I find them a source of humor!
33:04
Where a lot of people would find them a source of irritation.
33:07
I find them as a source of humor.
33:09
I mean, why be angry with them?
33:11
They - you can't be
33:14
angry at ignorance!
33:18
True.
33:18
I mean really, you know, that would be playing their game.
33:26
No, we kind of enjoy our distinctions.
33:33
Do you uh, raise them to not like the white man?
33:37
Of course not!
33:38
No, in fact we encourage - uh,
33:42
I may sound like, you know, like I don't like the white man.
33:45
No.
33:45
No, no, no, that's completely out of context.
33:49
No.
33:52
I do, I enjoy all people.
33:56
I enjoy all people, uh,
34:01
it's not my place to judge them.
34:06
So, you know, it's like this house - it's, it's like Shoe's [?] house.
34:12
It's on the honor system.
34:15
And those that defile the honor, they're just not welcome.
34:22
But no, this door is always open.
34:27
It's always open.
34:28
You know, there's always a hand available.
34:31
Well, we have a lady and her son here, Marie.
34:36
They're out from North Carolina.
34:37
They've just gone through a very emotional and degrading-breakup.
34:46
And you know, she's, was in the state of blowing her brains out.
34:51
She had no way - come out here.
34:57
Come home.
34:59
Come here and let us try and help.
35:02
That's it, and we've done this for years, and years, and years.
35:06
We would have it no other way.
35:10
No, to say I don't like the white man would be erroneous.
35:19
I don't trust him.
35:19
[both laughing] Okay?
35:24
But like him, yes.
35:25
I just don't trust him.
35:28
I mean, what's he gonna steal from me?
35:30
I don't own anything.
35:31
He made sure of that years ago!
35:38
Can you talk to me about your parents?
35:40
Not much is known about them.
35:42
Great-Grandfather's the one that raised me.
35:43
Dad, uh,
35:48
broke the Great Wall.
35:49
He married outside the tribe.
35:51
He was a full-blood.
35:53
He married a lady that was Kwakiutl and Jewish.
35:58
The Kwakiutl, that's the Indians of British Columbia, that carved the
36:01
totem poles the Chilkat blankets.
36:04
Alright, apparently her mother had, uh, married a Russian Jew fur
36:13
trapper, or something like that.
36:15
Up in Canada.
36:16
Now, how mom and dad ever got together, I, you know, to this
36:19
day, well, I don't even know.
36:20
But I know they did.
36:21
I know Dad was banned from the [unclear] Reservation in Mississippi forever.
36:26
He was never allowed to return.
36:28
For breaking the Law.
36:31
I could visit it, but I couldn't stay overnight!
36:35
So, we were on the other Reservation, which was in Oklahoma,
36:38
a place called Broken Bow, which is just west of Eagleton.
36:41
In fact, dead north of Paris, Texas.
36:48
Well, like I say, you people don't even know what the Laws are, yet,
36:52
I mean not you - I'm taking the context of the white idiom, out here.
36:57
They don't know what Laws are!
37:02
I'm not even sure they know what the sacred is.
37:05
Otherwise, they wouldn't be doing what they're doing.
37:11
They wouldn't be standing out there and cheating every
37:14
chance they get for their gain.
37:20
I mean what are we supposed to do as Native Americans.
37:24
Buy skyhooks?
37:27
See, there's nowhere for us to go any more.
37:30
I'm the last living member of my family, and it's gonna stay that way.
37:33
More
37:36
or less the Walkinstik-Man-Alone name, when I go, it goes!
37:43
At one time, I didn't want it that way, but now - I don't know.
37:47
You know, kinda caught in between.
37:51
Maybe I ought to do what Great-Grandfather said - let it in there.
37:58
You know, they broke his heart!
38:01
They trashed it.
38:01
He was so angry, he refused to ever learn anything dealing
38:04
with the English language.
38:09
He hated it so bad.
38:11
He hated the handling.
38:15
The broken promises.
38:17
White man doesn't know what a promise is!
38:21
But to him, I guess it was made in good intentions, uh,
38:25
see - promises have long memories.
38:28
The white man doesn't - out of sight, out of mind.
38:31
And you asked
38:40
about land - and land rights.
38:44
We don't have any land rights!
38:47
Not really.
38:49
What's happening at Big Mountain is a good example of it.
38:53
If they want it, they'll come take it.
38:55
You know, you don't see too much of it in the Northwest yet.
38:59
But of course these are the last tribes to be affected by the western
39:02
migration of the white people.
39:06
But, see, the directive is already written in Washington, D.C., under
39:12
B.L.M. and B.I.A. - Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs
39:17
- to do away with all reservations.
39:20
To assimilate the Indian into the "melting pot." Now I mean - I may not
39:28
see it in my time, but it's coming.
39:30
And lot of the Indians out here are totally oblivious.
39:34
"Oh, it won't happen to us, da-da-da-da." "We're protected - you
39:37
know, we have...what's this,
39:40
uh, Restoration Program and everything." Restoration's just another form of bull.
39:47
I mean, you know, with big, long horns.
39:51
It, no, uh-uh, they're only fooling themselves.
39:55
There are no reservations left in Oklahoma.
40:00
Ours was taken away from us in the 1940s.
40:05
It's now, where the Indians are, it's just called Indian Row.
40:10
It stretches from southeastern Oklahoma all up into northeastern
40:12
Oklahoma, but reservations, no.
40:15
There are no official reservations left in Oklahoma.
40:20
And, the Navajo Reservation.
40:22
The Navajos were moved down around the Hopi at the turn of the century.
40:33
Their reservation was up at Black Mesa.
40:34
There are a few Navajos that are still up in that area there, sure,
40:39
those that weren't in the way.
40:41
And they went and strip-mined the coal, strip-mined the uranium.
40:42
Now, they bypassed thirteen environmental impact laws to
40:42
go ahead and strip-mine that
40:54
out.
40:56
And the land is totally unreclaimable!
41:00
All the tailings and everything are laying just the way it was dug up.
41:04
The radioactive tailings from the uranium mining, are all laying right there.
41:09
The Navajos that are around that area there have used those
41:12
tailings to build their homes.
41:14
Now we have a massive, massive, horrendous problem with
41:22
birth defects, cancer, respiratory problems and everything else that
41:26
are directly related to this.
41:28
Course they didn't bother to notify the Navajos that it was dangerous.
41:34
Now, you see, out here, you couldn't begin to do that!
41:37
You couldn't go in there and tear up the land, leave it lay like that.
41:40
You have to recover it, put it back as close to the way it was, but
41:44
you see, the government's thinking on this is "Well why bother?
41:47
It's Indian land!
41:51
We just - you know tear it up - make it a little rougher for 'em.
41:55
They like to live like that."
41:58
Well - that's - virtually it's just, um, if it was brought out clearly, and
42:05
in the clear words that it's supposed to be, it was deliberate homicide.
42:13
You know, just deliberate homicide.
42:14
They were in the way.
42:16
Now the white people out here, they think well, you know, they got it
42:19
set pretty well, and everything else.
42:22
But uh, say - they are not looking at the vested interest, but the
42:26
vested interest is looking at them.
42:30
You have a law out here that is very interesting.
42:34
Very similar to the one they use on, uh, taking reservations
42:37
away and everything else.
42:38
The law out here is called Eminent Domain.
42:42
If you're in the way - they move you!
42:46
They'll take your land and move you - physically.
42:51
You see, the white people can't relate that law to what's been going on for over
42:57
500 years here with the Native American.
43:02
They can't relate the law to what happened up in Hawaii.
43:05
They can't relate the law to what's happened in all the South Pacific islands.
43:09
And in the Virgin Islands.
43:10
And the east Atlantic or the west Atlantic.
43:14
They just do not relate to this, to where they're standing right here.
43:20
Well, ask those people that have been in the path of a freeway!
43:27
And they'll find out immediately.
43:28
Well okay, like with the Navajo.
43:32
They're taking these poor individuals.
43:34
They've taken a couple, three thousand of them, gave them nice houses, in town.
43:40
Now remember, these are sheep herders, with no skills, that
43:46
have never lived outside the confines of their ancient lives.
43:52
Most do not even speak the English language.
43:54
Have been forcibly moved into a hostile area - you know, in town with the whites.
44:01
And the whites resent it very much.
44:04
Given these beautiful homes, and the banks immediately come in and
44:07
give 'em loans on these homes, you know, mortgage their homes so they
44:11
can get the fancy car and everything else and live like the white man.
44:16
But they forgot to tell the Indian one thing when they do it
44:21
- he's unskilled.
44:23
He has no job or anything else.
44:24
So what happens when the note comes due?
44:28
They take his car, and his home!
44:29
And put him on the street.
44:32
He can't go back to the land he came off of.
44:38
So, he has to go out there and get himself a skyhook.
44:40
Skyhooks don't exist.
44:45
There's no place for the Indian here.
44:50
See, the thing that irks me the most, and, uh, in fact, I think it's
44:56
probably the grossest insult that the Native Americans have ever suffered
45:02
- is the white man calling an American Indian an amateur environmentalist.
45:10
Calling the American Indian an amateur environmentalist.
45:15
That this land thrived without problem
45:20
for time immemorial before he showed up!
45:24
And in less than 500 years it's not even safe to drink the water, let
45:28
alone go out and breathe the air.
45:33
And this is progress?
45:36
It's progress to "Stone City", is what it is.
45:39
In case you don't know what "Stone City" is, that's, you know, these
45:41
little plots of land you see around with headstones on 'em.
45:44
Okay.
45:45
Great progress.
45:47
Excellent, nice thinking.
45:52
[chuckling] Amatuer environmentalist indeed!
45:57
But land rights - no, we don't have any, not really.
46:02
I don't care what the clown up there in Washington, D.C. will say, you know, "Well
46:05
we gotta help these poor Indian people"
46:09
They could help by leaving us alone - dammit!
46:13
That would be, you know, the greatest help they could ever do.
46:16
Leave us alone and stay out of our hair, and for Christ sakes stay out of our, you
46:24
know, our tribal lives.
46:27
If they really want to learn, they're most welcome!
46:30
But to come in, and to turn around and say "Oh no, you're doing it all wrong!"
46:35
Well, that's like asking the Black person to come in to, say,
46:40
a Mexican town and to turn around and tell them they're all stupid!
46:46
How far would he get?
46:49
He'd better have a razor 'bout that long, okay,
46:54
that's just to knock the bullets away as they're coming!
46:59
No I,
47:03
now, just sit back and kind of watch it evolve.
47:08
I'm up to my ears in Native American affairs.
47:10
In fact uh, I guess
47:17
- [break in recording]
47:18
-uh,
47:21
you know the white man, uh, they turn around and make a law and enforce
47:31
it, quite frequently without anybody's vote.
47:34
Except, you know, their quote "leader", and,
47:42
uh, that law is enacted and enforced,
47:46
and that's okay and if somebody doesn't like it, they can get up and you
47:52
know, raise a little smoke about it.
47:54
Uh, it might be delegated and regulated and then, maybe changed to some extent.
48:02
But if you take an indigenous individual or somebody not of the color of
48:06
the white, and they turn around and start questioning the law, say, we
48:10
get slapped with the "activist"'- activist - doesn't make sense.
48:19
It does not make sense!
48:23
When you turn around and say "Hey, it's wrong" you know it's wrong -I know it's
48:27
wrong - let's do something about it.
48:29
Well, the vested interests turn around and say "Oh, nail that activist!
48:33
You know, he's making waves!"
48:37
Well,
48:39
how do you fight something like that?
48:42
Sure, I was on Alcatraz.
48:45
Damn proud of it too.
48:46
I was at the Nisqually fishing up in Washington.
48:50
Proud of that!
48:51
I was at St. Regis.
48:52
Damn proud of that!
48:54
You went to, um, protest at Alcatraz?
48:57
Alcatraz, yes.
48:58
Alcatraz Island.
48:59
Alcatraz means "pelican".
49:02
But, um, okay, here it was.
49:06
Alioto was the mayor of San Francisco at the time.
49:09
Since Alcatraz is in the county of San Francisco, you might say, uh,
49:16
whatever the name of the county is - I can't remember the name right now.
49:19
Anyway, Alioto, when they closed down the federal prison, uh, it's in the 1863
49:25
treaty that that belongs to the Indians.
49:27
Okay?
49:28
Being held in trust for the Indians.
49:30
I like that - "Held in Trust", uh [chuckles] well, why can't we have it?
49:36
Well anyway, they decided that uh the power, the Fathers in San Francisco
49:42
decided "Well, we'll sell it to these big corporate types - they'll put a nice
49:45
resort out there on the Island." Sell it?
49:51
Sell It!
49:55
Why don't they ask the owners?
49:57
You know.
49:59
They were gonna build a big resort and everything else out there, you know.
50:02
"Well the Indians got no use for it!" So, well the, you've seen the
50:08
unification of the Native American.
50:11
It happened at Alcatraz.
50:14
More or less, enough is enough!
50:16
You're not gonna do like you did on the East coast!
50:21
Get, you know, an island for $12.50 worth of beads.
50:26
We have, you know, learned a little bit since then.
50:29
So, I mean $12.50 worth of beads - that's fine!
50:33
But we're still not that stupid, we ain't stupid enough that
50:35
we're just gonna let you take it!
50:38
And furthermore, it's not for sale!
50:40
Did that happen in the 60's?
50:41
Yes.
50:42
Yes, uh-huh.
50:43
1969.
50:45
I read about that in the book we have.
50:48
Oh great - well, you're looking at one of those smiling faces that was
50:51
standing out there, you know, giving a few war hoops every now and then.
50:56
But, uh, it's just, you know, it was just one of those
51:01
crazy things!
51:04
There's Laurie.
51:07
Anyway,
51:10
we drew the line there.
51:13
Now, excuse the expression, and I think maybe it'd be about the time
51:16
to say it, it's now we're pissed off.
51:22
If the white man wants to play the game that way,
51:27
there's one thing about the Indian - he understands.
51:31
White man's got no honor.
51:34
And if an Indian has to die, at least there's honor in death.
51:41
We're gonna fight from now on, and we're gonna fight harder.
51:47
What happened with that fishing - the fishing rights?
51:51
Nisqually?
51:52
Oh - it's been prolonged.
51:55
That came under the, uh, under another treaty in which the
52:00
Nisqually were guaranteed the uh fishing rights, in perpetuity.
52:04
That means forever!
52:05
There's no question about it.
52:07
It's their right to fish on that river.
52:10
Well, the commercial fisherman, who are out there with their big nets and
52:13
everything else, you know, gathering up everything, and the Nisqually picking
52:17
up the, you know, the few extra salmon running up the river, not quite that many,
52:23
were being blamed for taking all the fish!
52:26
It's the commercial fisherman!
52:27
Well, the commercial fisherman
52:35
- [Someone knocks at the door] Ya!
52:35
Hello?
52:35
[break in recording]
52:35
Anyway, uh, the fishing right thing is coming up again; is gonna effect
52:38
the great, greater Northwest Indians.
52:41
It's just that, you gotta remember that most of the, uh, quote
52:46
"commercial fisherman", are white.
52:48
And they're lobbying right now, to do away totally with those clauses
52:54
in the treaty allowing the Indian
52:59
his natural traditional way of life, and a way to feed his family.
53:04
See again, they're taking the only occupation these people have
53:07
and understand, away from them, which is a tradition, which is a
53:10
religion - and turning around and saying "Go put on a suit, and you
53:15
go downtown and work." You know.
53:19
Well that's like, it's like you know, taking tepees and buffalos on the freeway.
53:24
Makes about as much sense.
53:25
But it's no good.
53:28
So, uh, but that - you're gonna be seeing a lot of that here before long,
53:32
but the object is that you're gonna start seeing a lot of violence here.
53:37
Unfortunately.
53:39
And I understand from a few people that I've talked to over in the Islands,
53:47
they're not at all happy any more.
53:50
A lot of the encroachment that's going on into, further into the Islands,
53:54
into some of the sacred areas.
53:56
And uh, [chuckles] every once in a while, I mean, white boy comes back over - got
54:02
his head shoved in by the, you know-[Phone rings] [Tape stops and starts again]
54:07
But anyway, uh, like I said, I've seen a few white boys walk back over here with
54:13
their head stoved in, and somebody called them a haole just before they hit 'em.
54:16
[both chuckle], and they can't understand why - they apparently are the sons of some
54:22
developers, that are over there, that are saying, you know, "What the hell - some
54:27
dumb superstition. Plow it under and put a condo there." He has no concept!
54:36
And I, you know, I hope the Polynesians do get up and start
54:41
knocking the snot out of 'em.
54:44
They're not gonna find it so easy with us anymore!
54:47
The object is, is that we're slowly unifying.
54:52
Unifying, meaning that right now, all the Indians are their
54:55
own, in their own tribes.
54:58
No, we're unifying as a Nation of Indians.
55:01
More or less, you know, old tribal grievances and stuff like this, that
55:07
had been in existence for centuries,
55:11
are being cast aside for the, uh, defense of - to maintain what little
55:18
we do have, and that is our identity.
55:22
As the natives of this country they call America.
55:29
We don't own the land.
55:33
We were put here as the caretakers!
55:37
Now we have somebody here to turn around tellin' us that
55:43
we don't know how to care-take.
55:44
Therefore, we shouldn't have it.
55:47
And therefore, that since they're better equipped, they'll care-take it.
55:53
Only trouble is - is their caretaking is awful rough on moccasins!
55:59
You fall on the ground and you know, you get a bruise or two - and
56:02
you fall on concrete out here -if you get up, you're gonna be lucky!
56:07
The Great Spirit didn't mean for there to be all this concrete.
56:11
This stone that's not natural...The Great Spirit God didn't mean for people
56:17
to be stacked on top of each other.
56:19
If he had he would have built 'em stacked on top of each other; didn't mean for 'em
56:23
to come over here and smell like roses, or
56:28
what have you.
56:29
If he'd a wanted, he'd a made 'em a rose.
56:32
I mean, you know, you turn on the television anywhere,
56:36
you're evil if you stink.
56:38
You're evil if you smell like yourself.
56:40
They don't even know what a person smells like anymore.
56:43
He's gotta smell like some flower of some type, you know.
56:48
Real flowers of the family - blooming idiots.
56:52
[laughing] And you know, it's
56:59
- I don't know.
57:01
Like I said, being out here is still strange to me.
57:05
But that's why I feel more at home in Japan, or over in the Islands, or
57:08
down in New Zealand, than I do here.
57:14
I mean, this is foreign to me.
57:19
I don't - it doesn't make any sense, what's going on.
57:23
It's against all teaching!
57:27
Yet I'm forced to live in it.
57:30
Can you tell me something about the Choctaw Tribe?
57:36
How they-
57:37
Choctaw.
57:37
Choctaw.
57:37
How they - did they live in a teepee?
57:39
Or those mud houses?
57:40
Oh no, no.
57:40
The Choctaw are part of the longhouse people.
57:45
You had what, excuse the expression, "Five Civilized
57:48
Tribes" quote, a Yankee term, okay?
57:53
And there were the Cherokee, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole.
58:02
Alrighty, as history has it, we're also known as the Disowned, more
58:08
or less, we broke the Great Law.
58:10
We came south to hunt, and did not return to the great North, the Northeast.
58:16
Now if you get up around the Seneca, the, the Assiniboine, uh, Mohawk,
58:24
Huron those nations up there.
58:26
Those are all longhouse people.
58:28
Corn planters people.
58:29
Corn Planter was the first major chief that the United States signed
58:32
a treaty with, uh, George Washington.
58:34
That treaty was broken here, back in the 1940's or 1950's.
58:41
Blatantly busted!
58:42
In, a, uh, when they put up a dam in a place called, what the Indians now call
58:47
Lake Perfidy, it, uh, it's on that album.
58:52
Bitter Tears by Johnny Cash.
58:54
But anyway, uh,
58:57
the Choctaw are longhouse people, just like the people of the great
59:02
Northeast, more or less the long, rectangular houses, that were communal.
59:09
Alright.
59:09
They were partitioned off for some privacy, but they were primarily communal.
59:13
They were also noted as the Mound People.
59:17
And, uh, I get a kick out of you know, sitting here and reading all
59:21
these cute little anecdotes coming up in anthro-magazines about all these
59:25
mysterious mounds coming up through Ohio and through the Carolinas and everything
59:29
else, and what are they, and what do they represent, the whole shootin' match.
59:33
And, um, I, you know, kinda tongue and cheek it every once in a while,
59:38
remember what Great Grandfather said - he turned around and he said "Gonna let'
59:42
'em mull over these for a while, that oughta blow their minds, you know."
59:45
But he didn't say it that way, but it's the closest translation I can
59:50
make, without being, uh, facetious.
59:56
Uh, but they never thought to think that maybe,
1:00:02
uh, the answer's right in front of 'em, but they're so close to the
1:00:05
trees they can't see the forest.
1:00:08
If they ever stopped to think that maybe some of these are representations
1:00:11
of clans, and clan burial grounds.
1:00:14
Ah.
1:00:18
It's one element, also some of the mounds have no burials in 'em or anything else.
1:00:23
These are sacred.
1:00:24
The Choctaw in history and belief, believe they came from one of these mounds.
1:00:29
That's rather ironic, uh, my research in later years, uh, we find that
1:00:36
the Hopi had the same belief.
1:00:39
And several tribes have beliefs similar to this - that we came from under, out
1:00:48
into this world.
1:00:51
But, uh, pick up a book called The Book of the Hopi sometime;
1:00:56
it's rather interesting.
1:00:57
But no, the Choctaw are Mound people, and there were several
1:01:02
tribes involved in Mound building.
1:01:06
Uh, also, we were a republic,
1:01:13
more or less.
1:01:14
The Choctaw were a republic.
1:01:16
You'll find out a lot of the, uh,
1:01:20
forming of the American government is directly taken from the longhouse people!
1:01:27
The American government is set up in many aspects like the Indian republics
1:01:33
were; particularly those of Corn Planter and a few of the others-more or less the
1:01:39
Mohawk, the Seneca, the Iroquois nations.
1:01:45
Can you tell me some of the laws of the Tribe?
1:01:48
Uh, I have to think a minute cause I have to watch, uh,
1:01:54
what I'm - if it's forbidden.
1:01:56
Well, I told you one; uh, the one my Father broke.
1:02:03
He can never return 'cause he married outside the Tribe.
1:02:05
That's, that's in the Bloods.
1:02:06
If you break a law, then it's automatic that you can't come back?
1:02:11
No it depends on the law you break.
1:02:14
The severity of the Law.
1:02:16
Uh, to marry outside the Tribe, as a pureblood, is the equivalent
1:02:21
of, you know, of a murder.
1:02:27
You've destroyed a very sacred part of an indigenous group.
1:02:32
And, um,
1:02:35
banishment is usually the penalty more than taking them out and hanging 'em
1:02:42
or something like that, which is, you know, actually it' s just not done.
1:02:49
Banishment was probably the most devastating thing that could happen.
1:02:59
Uh - Laws, laws, laws, laws.
1:03:05
You don't whistle on the Reservation
1:03:10
at night.
1:03:10
That's a belief that we have.
1:03:12
What?
1:03:12
That's a belief that we have.
1:03:12
That's - you'll find it's a very common belief amongst the indigenous, because
1:03:15
you do not wish to wake the evil spirits.
1:03:17
Right.
1:03:18
Right.
1:03:19
Yeah.
1:03:21
That, that's a very steadfast rule in a great number of Indians,
1:03:27
indigenous colonies of the Americas.
1:03:31
And it's also uh true as you get into the Eastern Atlantic
1:03:36
regions, it's still there, I hope.
1:03:39
All throughout the South Pacific it's the same way.
1:03:42
I know that the Māoris, will actually turn pale at night if you whistle.
1:03:48
Uh,
1:03:52
Laws: Well the Great Laws, which were handed time immoral, make
1:03:59
the Ten Commandments look like something that came out of a cartoon.
1:04:05
More or less Laws such as
1:04:10
it's forbidden to strike a woman, for any reason.
1:04:14
It just something forbidden, don't do it!
1:04:18
Out here, the white man, he takes fair game in seeing how
1:04:22
fast he can knock one down.
1:04:23
How quick he can insult one.
1:04:26
This is unheard of!
1:04:29
In fact it's mind boggling!
1:04:30
I still can't handle it myself out here.
1:04:33
It's just you know, in fact most of the fights I've been in here in
1:04:37
the white world have been when a man has abused a woman, verbally.
1:04:43
And, uh, it's, well unfortunate, turn around to say you know,
1:04:51
that's not very cool man - and of course, the guy takes a swing, and of course, the
1:04:54
next thing I know, I want to scalp him.
1:04:57
[both laugh] But remember now, the scalping and tomahawks are not Indian.
1:05:03
Scalping?
1:05:04
Scalping is not Indian; and tomahawks are not Indian.
1:05:07
Scalping was introduced by the French, tomahawks were introduced by the British.
1:05:12
We just had good teachers.
1:05:16
We had something like a mace, or a "coup" club, is what it was
1:05:19
called, usually it was a curved stick with a round stone in it.
1:05:23
And what you did, you went up there, you went up and counted "coup",
1:05:26
or otherwise knocked his head in.
1:05:28
Counted "coup" was meaning to ride into the thick of the battle, strike
1:05:31
your enemy without killing him, and leave the battle, and count "coups".
1:05:36
Alright?
1:05:37
Uh, we had games like lacrosse, which is a,
1:05:44
what could I say is a mild - well, you've played over here at the
1:05:47
campus, a mild form of lacrosse.
1:05:52
Okay?
1:05:52
Ours was rather brutal.
1:05:54
In fact, it could be quite brutal.
1:05:59
Uh,
1:06:03
Jesus, there's so much
1:06:07
- you cannot - Oh, okay, another thing too, is you see - this just galls
1:06:12
me - I'm out here all the time seeing it - We think all Indians wear long
1:06:18
hair, the headdresses, stuff like this.
1:06:21
Now, this let's examine that closer you know.
1:06:25
Because you go to the pow-wows and everything around here.
1:06:27
Or you see pictures it's always somebody in a headdress, yeah, with long hair
1:06:31
hanging down and feathers sticking up.
1:06:35
That's rather difficult if you're on horseback, and riding
1:06:38
through the woods isn't it?
1:06:40
You're liable to get hung by your own hair.
1:06:45
No, they, uh, what they call the Appalachian Indians, of which Choctaw is
1:06:51
considered part of the group, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Chippewa, Creek, uh, Natchez
1:06:57
and a bunch of other tribes like that, always wore close-cropped hair.
1:07:00
In fact, um, one of the ways you can trace some of the elements back as far as
1:07:05
finding out where the southeastern tribes came from, is one, by dress; two, by their
1:07:14
houses; and three, by their hair styles.
1:07:18
You get in amongst the Cherokees, you'll find out they wear Mohawk haircuts.
1:07:25
The more traditional the Cherokee is, the more of a Mohawk he's got!
1:07:29
And you see that in Cherokee in North Carolina right now.
1:07:34
Now the Cherokee in North Carolina are the ones that the government
1:07:38
didn't get during the Trail of Tears.
1:07:40
They hid out!
1:07:41
Well, they still have their Reservation there, and believe
1:07:44
me, they're very staunch about it.
1:07:47
And, uh, they just,
1:07:52
they don't mind white folk coming, but, uh, like I said, they don't
1:07:56
hate 'em, they just don't trust 'em.
1:07:59
And, uh, they tend their own business, their own law, their
1:08:03
everything else, like I say.
1:08:05
We, the Choctaws, just here in the, what was it, about fifteen
1:08:10
years ago, got the right to try our own people under Indian law.
1:08:19
More or less, it came under the, uh, Brother's Mercy case
1:08:26
back several years ago where the member of a family had asked to be
1:08:31
dispatched because he could no longer live the way he was living, and
1:08:35
had asked his brother to kill him.
1:08:38
Mercy killing.
1:08:40
His brother did.
1:08:41
Well, the white government stepped in and, you know, "we're gonna
1:08:44
hang that sucker up for murder".
1:08:47
And, uh, I can tell ya right now we raised enough stink and enough
1:08:53
dissension among the Native American groups of that area, that the
1:09:00
government backed off and Choctaws now try their own people, under their own laws.
1:09:08
Because, they know, the white man cannot comprehend the traditional laws.
1:09:15
He's not interested enough to learning 'em.
1:09:18
His mind doesn't work that way.
1:09:20
You know, he's got, uh, well, you know, his form of logic - his form
1:09:28
of logic - nobody else has any logic.
1:09:33
But, uh, no, laws
1:09:37
that just - you have to live there in order to understand them.
1:09:42
Most of 'em are not written down.
1:09:46
It's a living thing - just like over in the Islands.
1:09:48
They're not written down.
1:09:49
It's something that you're brought up with - a custom - custom
1:09:54
law - they're laws involving custom.
1:09:58
You know, and anything dealing with
1:10:02
it.
1:10:02
Sit down and say "What are some of the Laws?" I can
1:10:05
pinpoint a few, and that's it!
1:10:08
But the overall - no - it's something you have to live.
1:10:15
The one I told you would be classified as a superstition!
1:10:20
So they would turn around and say "That's not a law - it's a
1:10:22
superstition." Believe me, it's a law!
1:10:27
You can, you know, get badly beaten for whistling!
1:10:32
And you can, in a lot of cases, if you persist, be banned!
1:10:40
Another thing too, is amongst our people, you don't,
1:10:49
if psychologically there's something wrong with 'em, in the Native American
1:10:56
belief there's nothing wrong with 'em, that they are "gifted" somehow.
1:11:02
In another spirit - and they're not to be harmed.
1:11:05
They're not to be abused.
1:11:08
The same thing out here, where you have, where they got you know, the
1:11:14
constant battle about the homosexuals,
1:11:18
Native Americans have 'em too - any indigenous people have 'em,
1:11:22
except these are highly respected!
1:11:24
And they're usually midwives!
1:11:29
They're highly respected.
1:11:30
They have a high esteem in our tribe.
1:11:33
They're not looked down upon.
1:11:37
You know, everybody doesn't have to be a warrior - somebody's
1:11:41
got to deliver babies.
1:11:43
Otherwise you don't have any warriors.
1:11:49
So, the whole concept of - the easiest way to take the concept of the Native
1:11:55
American living, and their laws, is to go back to your roots, as a Polynesian,
1:12:03
as a Hawaiian, you can understand it,
1:12:09
the white person out there can't.
1:12:11
There's no way -he's not equipped to!
1:12:14
He's never seen it, he's never lived it.
1:12:16
"Yeah, live in a dirt floor shack!
1:12:20
Oh - go out and dance around a fire!
1:12:22
Eat stuff that was burnt in the ground!
1:12:25
Or, go out and get some stuff off trees, and make this delicious stuff".
1:12:35
They're not equipped!
1:12:36
They're not equipped.
1:12:41
The idiom is "Live, and let live." Out here, the white man can't do that.
1:12:46
If you don't live like a white man he doesn't let him live.
1:12:49
It their idea-
1:12:50
So do you feel that what is going on, like when Hawaii got taken over
1:12:55
by the white man, South Africa, and Indians, is that all the same?
1:13:00
Basically the same thing?
1:13:03
Exactly.
1:13:04
It is disgusting!
1:13:06
But it is, again, one race on this earth that is imposing its ideas upon
1:13:13
anything sacred, anything personal, anything human, in the name of their
1:13:19
God, which they don't even respect!
1:13:25
Their God's only part time - only
1:13:32
when they need him.
1:13:33
[break in recording]
1:13:33
We were
1:13:37
just discussing how this is happening in Africa, and the-oh-American Indian, just
1:13:45
about anywhere there's indigenous people,
1:13:53
we've covered that pretty well.
1:13:54
It is a disgrace - the white people, this one particular race, has no comprehension
1:14:02
- they're so caught up in their own idea.
1:14:10
They preach one thing - yeah - "Thou shalt not kill - and if you don't believe it,
1:14:14
I'll kill you!" That type of mentality.
1:14:20
The only thing right is white.
1:14:24
And, uh, unfortunately
1:14:28
I hate to leave him with a cold message
1:14:33
- if the only thing right is white, it's in the minority!
1:14:40
It's very definitely in the minority.
1:14:43
The white man doesn't understand that he is the minority!
1:14:46
You know, he calls himself
1:14:51
the majority.
1:14:55
He's gonna keep on, and he's gonna piss off the indigenous of this world, and
1:14:59
he is gonna become even more scarce!
1:15:04
But what he's doin' in the meantime, as a white man?
1:15:08
If he isn't controlled here before long, there won't be any world for any of us.
1:15:14
There won't be
1:15:17
anything.
1:15:17
Lot of people now, they're just don't even want children anymore
1:15:23
because of what is happening.
1:15:26
Why bring 'em here?
1:15:27
So they can be abused also?
1:15:30
So they can be insulted and degraded?
1:15:32
You know, debased?
1:15:35
That's not a way to live.
1:15:39
And I, you know, I'm not gonna be-excuse the expression-their Nigger.
1:15:45
I outgrew that a long time ago!
1:15:48
And, uh, I will not tolerate being talked down to by them.
1:15:56
They have no business, because one, they may be well educated,
1:16:02
but they're not mentally equipped
1:16:06
to handle truth.
1:16:11
Truth is, to them is,
1:16:15
is like a lollypop.
1:16:16
It's there until it melts.
1:16:19
It's temporary.
1:16:21
Only use it, you know, when it will benefit them.
1:16:27
Well, the government's the same way.
1:16:27
This is not a government, what they have.
1:16:31
This
1:16:33
is an oligarchy, more or less.
1:16:37
A government by the people, for the people - no, we don't have that anymore here.
1:16:44
And the biggest problem with it is, it's centralized!
1:16:49
I believe in the Polynesian government, it's like the Native American
1:16:53
government - it is non-centralized.
1:16:56
More or less, the decisions are made by all, for the benefit of all.
1:17:00
Not most -but for all.
1:17:04
And this is the thing that the white man cannot understand.
1:17:05
He has to have "A Leader" you know, Big Daddy, the honcho you know, okay.
1:17:13
"Charge!".
1:17:16
No, and he cannot even fathom the idea of a non-centralized government.
1:17:24
It's you know - it doesn't exist.
1:17:27
It's impossible.
1:17:28
It can't work.
1:17:30
That's funny-
1:17:33
how long have the Hawaiians been in the Islands?
1:17:34
How long have the Polynesians been in the
1:17:38
Hawaiian Islands?
1:17:40
A long time - way before they came.
1:17:44
Long, long before they came!
1:17:46
Same thing throughout all the South Pacific.
1:17:48
And they didn't have any problems.
1:17:50
Right.
1:17:52
In fact, they were
1:17:56
quite free.
1:17:57
You know, they were themselves.
1:18:03
The same thing here.
1:18:05
Uh, history here - without too much trouble to show,
1:18:09
Native Americans here - 25,000
1:18:15
years, and no problems.
1:18:15
And in Africa - look at it!
1:18:22
They've been down there since time immemorial, and they
1:18:26
were getting along just fine.
1:18:30
It don't make much sense.
1:18:33
You got one group people turn around and saying all the rest of you are wrong!
1:18:36
Uh huh.
1:18:38
So the best thing to do is I wish they'd shut up and start listening, more or
1:18:42
less, come in and learn something, for a change, instead of dictating.
1:18:48
They might find that there's a lot of beauty in the things they're
1:18:50
missing or that they're changing, I know that the devastation that's
1:18:54
been wreaked on the Hawaiian Islands is so disgusting that I mean,
1:19:02
I want to bomb it every time that I go there.
1:19:04
And
1:19:06
it's getting harder and harder to go over there and find something that's
1:19:11
even a semblance of being untouched.
1:19:14
You know [voice fades] . And that is, um,
1:19:22
the, what is the word for it, the legacy which has been handed us,
1:19:28
like you and a bunch of others, has been very, very predominantly here
1:19:33
in the United States amongst the Native Americans, the legacy is, uh,
1:19:40
infant mortality rate that would scare the hell out of any nation,
1:19:46
teenage suicide rate that should be nonexistent but is rampant,
1:19:55
the total debasement, cultural shock problem that to this day remains
1:20:04
totally ignored.
1:20:10
It's just... I...
1:20:17
I find it very difficult to
1:20:22
comprehend this,
1:20:24
this class of
1:20:27
individual, that
1:20:31
had appointed himself as "The Leader",
1:20:38
that has taken it upon themselves to go ahead and
1:20:44
purposely destroy things that he cannot fathom - or will not fathom - or
1:20:50
even bother to try and understand.
1:20:54
That, unfortunately,
1:20:58
in our belief and
1:21:03
language and idea, is not considered a human being,
1:21:12
but as a form of animal
1:21:20
that is known up in the northern part of the United States, particularly
1:21:26
central and northeastern part of the United States, called a kihkwahâkew
1:21:31
- wolverine!
1:21:33
Destroys for the love of destroying!
1:21:37
That, uh, I guess that's the only the way I can classify
1:21:39
the white man, is a kihkwahâkew
1:21:44
- wolverine.
1:21:47
He's the devil's child.
1:21:48
A
1:21:52
horrible thing to say, but what do you say after 500 years?
1:21:59
He's great?
1:22:02
[both laughing]
1:22:03
How come I keep hearing that word in the distant islands over there - haole.
1:22:09
And in New Zealand pākehā, and weihocha, and wachecho, and kuncha.
1:22:21
He's destroyed everything he's touched.
1:22:24
That was simple - it was beautiful.
1:22:27
I don't know - I don't know where to put it.
1:22:34
Like I say, I have a great many friends,
1:22:39
many of whom are welcome in this house here as guests but the white
1:22:43
man as a whole I do not trust!
1:22:46
But then those that enter this door are not white.
1:22:50
Even though their skin is.
1:22:53
Those are the ones you can trust.
1:22:55
It's just like walking [in] their shoes.
1:22:59
You know, Sharon and I were discussing that here a couple of days ago, and turned
1:23:05
around and said you know when we were there last Thanksgiving it was like uh,
1:23:10
going to dinner at the United Nations.
1:23:13
At this friend's house?
1:23:14
Yeah, it was such a pleasure.
1:23:17
It really was!
1:23:19
You know,
1:23:24
all these cultural differences there, but there was no cultural debasing!
1:23:28
So
1:23:31
all I gotta do is walk across the street, and in five minutes, I'll have
1:23:35
a dinner debasement that you wouldn't believe - with a book thrown in,
1:23:42
and well Shoe [?] was probably the reason why I moved here.
1:23:50
It's hard
1:23:54
to find people as pure and real as he is.
1:23:59
It's very, very difficult.
1:24:06
When I speak with Shoe [?] , you know,
1:24:11
it's here.
1:24:14
It's here, you know.
1:24:16
The man walks tall.
1:24:19
He never has to turn around and look at his shadow,
1:24:26
'cause his shadow is real - he's real.
1:24:28
He's a good man.
1:24:31
I'll tell ya
1:24:35
- if we had more like him making the rules out here
1:24:44
- I think there would be some hope for the future.
1:24:48
I really do!
1:24:50
I sincerely believe
1:24:54
it.
1:24:55
This is Michele M. Teruya.
