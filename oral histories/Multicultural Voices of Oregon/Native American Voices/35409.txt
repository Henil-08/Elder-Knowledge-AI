This is an oral history interview with Laurie LaPointe, an OSU student,
00:05
and full-blooded Lakotian Indian.
00:07
I’m interviewing Laurie LaPointe, a Sioux Indian from South Dakota.
00:14
Laurie, can you give me as much background as from where you come from, your tribe,
00:23
and some of the traditions that they
00:29
have?
00:30
Again, I am from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, the
00:33
south-central part of the state.
00:36
Much of what we consider our homeland consists of Badlands, Black Hills…a
00:47
famous monument nearby is Mount Rushmore.
00:50
A
00:52
great majority of my relatives still do live there, as ancestors
00:58
for generations back have.
01:02
And that is partly due to a tradition; a homeland is very much
01:07
that, though centuries ago the Plains Indians were very migratory,
01:14
partly due to the constraints that white men have put on us, yet…
01:19
Mm-hmm.
01:19
Yeah.
01:19
…we have always taken seriously homeland, you know, that that is very sacred.
01:27
Let’s see, as far as—
01:28
What tribe did you come from?
01:31
Okay, Sioux, which is the French name, the name that the French people gave
01:36
us which means Snake People, when actually we call ourselves Lakota,
01:42
and Lakota can kind of be equated with a family name, as in scientific.
01:49
And even under Lakota, there was a branch that referred to themselves as Dakota.
01:55
Huh.
01:58
I can’t quite off the top of my head remember what – it was something – it
02:02
was just a real minor qualification they made to the people, like the Northern
02:09
People, you know, something like that.
02:11
Right, mm-hmm.
02:13
Of Lakota, you can break it down into Yankton,
02:22
Oglala, Pine Ridge, Rosebud, and those actually referred to regional tribes,
02:32
and I belong to the Rosebud.
02:35
I’m not quite sure how you – I guess to like different tribes in Africa.
02:39
Yeah.
02:39
You know, we consider them all Negroid, yet each tribe—
02:42
There’s the Mandinkas, there’s the Zulus and things like that.
02:45
Exactly, exactly.
02:47
Exactly, and even within Lakota, there were some dialect variations too.
02:54
Not too much, but some.
02:57
Were you guys – buffalo was your main subsistence for where you—
03:03
Well, see that’s a little bit of a fallacy in that we did rely on
03:11
buffalo for very nearly the sole source of protein in our diet, yet
03:21
just as much, if not more, of our actual diet consisted of vegetable.
03:26
You know, of the berries and the roots and—
03:29
So, you were hunters and gatherers, as compared to the more settled
03:35
Indians who were agricultural.
03:37
Right, right.
03:38
We didn’t…actually employ the land.
03:43
You know, we didn’t raise gardens, we didn’t raise crops and harvest and
03:47
things like that, but we used, to a great extent, what was available on the
03:53
land, again, the wild roots, the berries.
03:58
And that was – those things were very important to fill in when the buffalo, you
04:06
know, in the middle of winter and things like that when you didn’t have the fresh
04:09
buffalo available and things like that.
04:11
So, though people consider us the buffalo tribe in our main
04:19
[stumbles] subsistency, excuse me, it’s only because that was really
04:22
the only meat source that we pursued.
04:26
We didn’t eat too many other things because we didn’t consider anything else
04:33
to have been given to us, you know, as a food source, where in our philosophy
04:42
the purpose for the buffalo’s existence was to provide food for Lakota… So,
04:54
let’s see, what else?
04:55
How much do you know about the traditional religion?
05:00
Okay, something about that, that I always, because I actually have
05:06
been asked that question quite a few times, and I always – a lot of people
05:11
understand it at least somewhat, but I usually always clarify that, per
05:17
se, Indians don’t have a religion.
05:19
Right.
05:20
If you went home, said “what is your religious affiliation,” and
05:25
you were speaking to a traditional Indian, you know, with a traditional
05:30
Indian mentality, he would not know to what you were referring.
05:34
Right.
05:34
He – because no such word even exists in the language.
05:39
You would – in essence, you would be expecting that man to sit down and define
05:44
the totality of his life, you know?
05:46
Right.
05:47
And I don't think many of us are prepared to do that at a moment’s notice
05:52
[Robert laughs] . But to go with the analogy of what you’re referring, I’m
06:00
not
06:04
too – at least by detail – familiar with actual rites and
06:10
ceremonies and things like that.
06:12
I know some of the greater philosophies and principles and concepts behind things.
06:20
You know, for instance, the…in the Indian philosophy, there is a great reverence,
06:31
nearly to the point of worship, for Mother Earth, where we perceive that
06:40
all life has emanated from Mother Earth.
06:48
Let’s see, as far as our creation story, I think it’s something like
06:54
Pollen Boy met Corn Husk Girl, something like that, you know, where in our
07:01
philosophies human beings are not the only animated creatures, you know.
07:07
Other things possess their own spirit as well.
07:11
Do you believe in the Great White Spirit, the One Spirit who
07:15
is – controls or is above all?
07:19
Yeah, um…
07:20
Because some tribes don’t believe in that.
07:21
I was wondering…
07:21
Right, right.
07:23
We believe that there are many spirits.
07:26
And yeah, we do believe that there is a controlling Great Spirit,
07:34
and then there are, semi to be equated with a god, and then there are all your
07:42
minor deities as well; wind, rain, sun, moon, mountain, rock, water, you know,
07:53
just about everything they believe possessed a divine character to it.
08:01
And that, a reverence being born out of honestly believing that that was true,
08:10
they – much of your typical Indian’s life was spent trying to be more and more
08:19
aware that you are never alone, either in presence, or never alone in reaction,
08:28
or every action you put forth does not just have repercussions on yourself.
08:38
It…you know, to them they can equate it with throwing a pebble out into the
08:43
middle of a pond, you know, the waves will go forever if the pond is forever
08:48
big, and so they see every little act they perform and every little task they
08:57
accomplish as being a very small, yet very important part of a greater whole.
09:03
You know, the harmony kind of a thing.
09:07
And, of course,
09:11
there are the rites and the ceremonies that go with just
09:16
about everything, you know.
09:17
There are few even everyday tasks that they perform without
09:24
some kind of mental preparation.
09:26
Of course, I am talking more of pre-white coming Indian.
09:33
Right, yeah.
09:34
Mm-hmm.
09:34
Where you – anymore you won’t see this, at least
09:37
– Yeah.
09:39
…that mentality quite as intensely.
09:45
So again, to ask an Indian what is your religion, you would need to ask them…
09:55
His whole life.
09:56
Right.
09:56
Why do you grind your corn circling to the right instead of to the left?
10:03
Why do you gather water only when the moon is half full, you know, and
10:11
such-a-such-a things where they actually have philosophies and attitudes and
10:18
reasonings behind that, you know, to which they adhere very seriously.
10:26
Laurie, could you tell me as much as you could what the traditional family
10:35
responsibilities, as what the woman did and the man and the child, children?
10:44
In that respect, my understanding is that your traditional family unit
10:53
was not much different than any Caucasian, in the sense of most of the upbringing,
11:02
at least for their first eight or nine, 10 years, was almost exclusively Mom.
11:08
And that was just partly because, you know, up until that age the child’s
11:13
needs are more physical and emotional, and there isn’t that much mental
11:20
develop—or actual leading mentality as far as, you know, education.
11:25
It’s all just kind of them experimenting with their own thoughts
11:29
and imagination and things like that.
11:33
So, in that sense, an Indian family was the same.
11:39
A part of something that might be a little different is that after that,
11:43
you know, those first 10 years or so,
11:47
the upbringing and the teaching of the children did become
11:50
strictly sexually differentiated.
11:55
The mother taught the girls and the father taught the boys.
12:00
Where Dad might have a little bit of authority and decision making in the
12:08
girl’s life, you know, even as far as things like marriage and things like
12:11
that, yet the mother, after that say 10 years, had no say in a son’s life.
12:18
A son became exclusively his father’s son.
12:24
And that, to them, was because a woman could know nothing.
12:28
I mean, just in their way of thinking, a woman could not know, because she was a
12:34
woman, what it was to have been brought up a man, you know, what it really means
12:39
to be a full Indian man, as it were.
12:46
And that was partly because in their perspective a woman, the woman was created
12:58
just to meet the needs of a man, and she didn’t need to worry about beyond that.
13:06
She needs to know how to make good corn mush and how to cure a buffalo
13:11
hide and sweep a clean teepee, and [Robert laughs] that was about that.
13:17
Has this changed?
13:19
Um…
13:20
For – as when the white man came along and then, as in modern-day
13:26
living on the reservation?
13:31
That’s kind of a hard question to answer because ideally, you know,
13:36
to make a really accurate comparison you would need to be able to
13:44
take a family pre-white and compare them to a family post-white, yet a family
13:54
that had, as much as possible, kept themselves apart from white influence.
14:04
And you can’t find that anymore, so I think just by sheer numbers
14:12
it was inevitable that in Indian society there crept in many white
14:19
attitudes and things like that.
14:22
And so, sure, as with almost…as with any other subcultures in the United States,
14:33
there’s a lot of attitude that you can see reflected in white society,
14:39
and sure among that being women’s lib, you know, or something like that.
14:45
Though…and I can’t say comparing that to any other ethnic
14:51
group, but from what I’ve seen,
14:58
the Indian women – perhaps I should even say from my mother’s generation – has
15:05
not pushed in that direction so much.
15:09
You know, they are satisfied with their lots in life, as it were, though
15:17
from my mother’s generation to present-day I think inevitably
15:25
your young Indian woman has a lot of the same attitudes as soon as
15:30
your young white woman, so [laughs]
15:32
. Mm-hmm.
15:32
In that sense, it would have changed.
15:37
Let me ask you this: as you stated before, the children were separated at a
15:44
certain age, say around eight, nine, 10 and the girls were taught by the mother
15:50
the daily chores and things like that, and whereas the boys were taught by their
15:56
fathers the hunting and things like that…
15:59
Right.
16:00
Where was the history?
16:05
How did they learn that?
16:09
Was there someone who – assigned this position that would, around the
16:14
campfire at night, the families would come together and they would listen
16:21
to this, you know, the man or woman…
16:24
Reciting the history?
16:27
Reciting the history, you know?
16:27
Yeah, most tribes did have their storyteller.
16:33
It
16:36
was a man who…and this was by tradition too, where if he was
16:43
born into that family, that was how he become a storyteller.
16:47
Okay.
16:47
Not otherwise.
16:50
Part of that – and I think this is a phenomenon that is in most cultures
16:57
too – is that that was just for survival.
16:59
You know, to be as consistent and as accurate with their history as
17:03
possible, that usually means a real direct linear relationship, you know,
17:09
where a father chose his eldest son.
17:13
You know, he did not choose his eldest son for one year and
17:18
then his middle son for another.
17:19
You know, just to maintain the – at least as much – of the totality
17:26
of the history, it needed to be one person telling another person.
17:31
So yeah, that was very important, though
17:38
Lakota were fairly technical – well, I shouldn’t say technical – but
17:44
at least very conscientious and precise at some written word.
17:52
Most of it was pictorial,
17:56
yet they did do that to a certain degree.
18:00
But again, a vast majority was verbal.
18:05
And then much of that to – I mean, I don't know if it’s obvious, but I said
18:11
the storyteller father to son, that again is almost always how it was.
18:16
You know, it was always the male.
18:18
And again, that was just the – in their perception, a male mind was just very
18:25
different from a female mind, where a male mind had been equipped for that
18:29
kind of memory, you know, that kind of understanding and all those things.
18:33
And to a certain degree,
18:37
women were not allowed very much, even to…
18:44
They were allowed to hear the general, like the creation story, and
18:51
Lakota are very famous for telling stories to convey morals, you know, and ethics and
18:58
things like that, and so there are always the stories that all children are told,
19:04
you know, to learn the common lessons.
19:06
You know, you put your hand too near the fire and you’re going to get
19:08
burnt [Robert laughs] , you know, they all heard those kinds of stories.
19:12
Yeah.
19:12
But when it came to the real…the stories describing tribal ceremonies
19:19
and tribal rites, there were many more of such stories that only men
19:25
could hear, versus there were a few that a mother would pass down only to
19:31
her daughter, and things like that.
19:32
But again, those were usually stories conveying
19:39
principles behind, or principles that made say everyday tasks important, you
19:45
know, that was probably to instill in them a value of what they were doing because
19:53
I imagine, as with any kids nowadays, a girl sometimes looks at what her dad is
20:02
doing with the son and saying why don’t I get to do those fun, exciting things,
20:05
and that happened back then too, I’m sure.
20:08
And so, that’s when a mother would step in and say, you know, your
20:13
role here is very important too.
20:15
You know, back when, with First Woman and First Man, you know, it was the
20:19
woman that did this and, you know.
20:24
So, I think a lot of the differentiated teaching, again, was partly
20:32
born out of a need to continue.
20:38
Way back when, when continuing meant just finding food for
20:43
the day and things like that,
20:47
probably culture, or their society or whatever, was not advanced enough
20:51
to…for everybody to be concerned about say tribal history and customs,
20:59
where a majority of the tribe needed to be concerned with gathering food.
21:03
That left the responsibility, say, in the hands of just one person: “well, we
21:09
will entrust to you to remember these things for us so that we can go out
21:14
and collect food” and things like that.
21:17
So, I’m sure where that differentiation came from.
21:20
And then again, a man, just for survival could be expected to teach
21:27
a son and remember all those things, but couldn’t be expected to be
21:32
able to teach his daughter as well.
21:33
Right.
21:33
You know, so that’s where a man said, “I will learn these things and teach my
21:38
son, and you, my wife, will learn these things and teach our daughter,” you know?
21:42
Mm-hmm.
21:43
And I think, by the same token – and I don't know how much of this is just…nature
21:54
kind of working itself out – but they were very compatible, you know, as
21:59
far as you don’t see, at least in the reading I’ve done and just observing of
22:08
interactions with families, you don’t see many times like the female stories
22:13
versus the male stories at cross purposes.
22:15
You know, they always, almost always, made allowance for what was going on in
22:23
the men’s lives and what was going on in the women’s lives and their roles.
22:27
And you know, so it wasn’t that it was a black and white.
22:30
It was very much like a jigsaw puzzle where they kind of
22:33
all fit together very neatly.
22:35
Huh, very interesting.
22:39
Do you know anything about
22:42
how young they got married, how many children, and the highlight or
22:46
the high point of the Sioux nation, of how many people, and can you…?
22:53
I don't know too much about numbers.
22:57
I do know that
23:01
– and I think that this is probably…well, kind of…what seems logical to me, anyway,
23:11
in thinking about it is that, as with any culture in the entire world, we’ve
23:15
all been migrating along a path of, you know, whatever, becoming technically
23:22
higher in society or all those things.
23:25
And that would have been true for the Lakota nation as well as any other.
23:32
And so,
23:35
what – I guess what you need to define is what along the line, you know, that
23:40
line of history has slowed us down, and I think the number one thing would
23:44
be the coming of white man where, for a time, we were completely oppressed.
23:52
You know, there was no chance to evolve in society.
24:00
We were boxed.
24:03
So, the high point would be just pre-white coming.
24:11
Pre-white, huh.
24:13
The average age, I think what we learned in the class, for marriage, was about 14
24:18
for the girl and about 15 for the boy?
24:21
Uh-huh.
24:21
Or young man?
24:22
Yeah, yeah.
24:24
That’s my understanding as well.
24:30
I don't know all the…physical reasons behind it, but what I’ve studied of
24:40
anthropology is that the Indian were maturing at a younger age than say their
24:50
counterpart Europeans where, in Europe, your 14-year-old girl and your 15-year
24:57
old boy, even in by society’s standards, were still in pantaloons and knickers.
25:05
You know, where they were – you know, a young man wasn’t considered
25:11
to be even intelligent until whatever, 20 or something like that.
25:18
And I think part of that too might be born out of physical circumstances in that in…
25:27
The children were given more responsibility at an early age.
25:31
Well, and that was partly born out of, again, a need for survival where, for
25:36
an Indian, they didn’t evolve, say in society… They didn’t move in the line
25:46
of okay, we’re going to quit trying to adapt to our environment all the time
25:52
and learn how to adapt our environment to ourselves, where that’s a lot – I
25:57
think – and I think to me, or in my opinion, that’s where the big divergence
26:01
came between Indian mentality and white mentality, is that an Indian never lost
26:07
sight of that he did not possess the land.
26:11
He did not possess the nature.
26:14
It was not his to adapt, you know.
26:17
Right, or to take.
26:17
He was only here to – right, to adapt to it.
26:20
And so, kind of out of that same mentality, the never lost the
26:25
need to just survive in their environment, and so that meant,
26:31
on just a purely physical basis,
26:36
part of survival just meant numbers, and numbers mean the younger you
26:41
can start propagating and the longer you have to propagate, you know.
26:46
So, I know there are all sorts of natural selection and evolutionary principles
26:53
behind that being a K-species versus an r-species and all that kind of stuff
27:00
[Robert laughs] , and I don't know what all that is, but I do know that… Oh,
27:06
like an example would be mosquitos and fish, you know, where just
27:11
to survive they propagate…
27:14
As much as—
27:14
A lot.
27:15
—Right, mm-hmm.
27:15
A lot, you know, and of all those numbers, how many survive?
27:19
Probably not very many, but that’s how they survive.
27:22
And I mean on a lot smaller basis, of course, I think that natural selection
27:32
worked so that your Indians were maturing at a little bit younger age,
27:37
and so marrying at a younger age too.
27:41
Hmm.
27:42
As compared to many European counterparts.
27:45
Okay.
27:48
Let’s get into some more personal history about you and your family.
27:59
How did your mom meet your dad, and how did you get out here to Oregon?
28:06
Well, my father was my mother’s second marriage.
28:12
Her first marriage
28:16
her husband was found missing in action or something like that.
28:22
I’m not even sure what all those details were.
28:24
And they’d just met on the reservation.
28:28
It’s a small place [laughs] , you get to know everybody.
28:36
And then my father she had known since they were children.
28:40
They had played together, so when she lost her first husband, just having
28:46
maintained natural friendship ties with my father and then just having those
28:51
work into a marriage relationship.
28:58
Nothing extraordinary, you know, about that.
29:04
Some – that, their marriage, lasted…let’s see [mutters]
29:16
…about 11 years, I guess.
29:21
And then when I was six they separated and he moved – okay, I guess I’m
29:30
kind of jumping ahead of myself.
29:31
So, they were married probably about 1955
29:40
on the Rosebud reservation.
29:44
She had my older sister and my brother
29:51
there on the reservation.
29:53
They lived there for several years, and then about 1960, I guess,
30:00
they moved to Denver, Colorado, and then I was born in 1961.
30:04
They had moved to Denver I think more just [for] economical reasons.
30:08
My mother got a job.
30:10
She had received her R.N. degree at nursing school in Nebraska and then
30:17
she had moved back home, and that’s when she married her first husband,
30:20
lost him, married my father, had two children, and moved to Denver,
30:27
Colorado where she had gotten a job at Denver General Hospital, and my
30:31
father had gotten a job at someplace.
30:35
I’m not sure [both laugh]
30:37
. And then I was born in 1961.
30:41
My father’s job was not panning out so he began looking around
30:46
for other jobs and my mother began looking around for other jobs, too.
30:50
She found this position in Silverton, Oregon, which is where we have moved
30:55
to and have lived there ever since.
30:57
And because it was a lucrative enough job, though my father hadn’t found a job
31:05
here, they moved out to Oregon anyway.
31:08
And my mother has lived in Silverton ever since.
31:12
Again, the primary reason being, you know, economics of the situation.
31:24
Something that my mother told me years later, I mean just years ago actually
31:32
– and I’m not sure how much this really entered in, though I know she thought
31:37
about it a lot, I don't know how much priority she actually gave to this thought
31:44
– but she said she’d always been very aware that to stay on the reservation, for
31:52
her, would have been very detrimental in that, for her personally, in that
32:01
she felt it would not have allowed her to grow and to pursue the prosperity
32:08
that she wanted to see in her life and she wanted to have for her children.
32:14
The quality of livelihood on the reservation
32:22
is not that good.
32:23
Rosebud Reservation is not one of your more prosperous ones.
32:28
Right.
32:31
And she knew she wanted to be a nurse, but the hospital in Rosebud offered
32:39
little advancement opportunities, and salary ceilings were very low
32:46
and, you know, things like that.
32:48
And so she knew – you know, part of the motivation was the finances, yet
32:54
she also knew that on a larger basis she wouldn’t – she couldn’t really
33:01
have the freedom that she wanted if she had stayed on the reservation.
33:04
Hmm.
33:05
But again, knowing my mother like I do, I don't know how much she would have
33:10
really allowed that to enter into her decision because had she felt that she
33:16
could have provided for her children just as fine on the reservation as
33:20
anywhere else, and yet still knew that she might personally not be able to
33:24
grow, she probably would have stayed,
33:29
thinking that the benefits of having her immediate family around and having
33:33
her kids grow up with the cousins and the aunts and the uncles might
33:37
have outweighed any, quote “freedom,” unquote, we may have had by moving away.
33:43
How
33:45
about your tradition and your mother teaching you the traditional
33:51
ways of life as an Indian?
33:54
And do you feel that because of situations like your mother’s and your own where
34:01
the Indians are forced to leave the reservation, that those traditions
34:09
are going to slip away and die and the Indian way of life is going to be gone?
34:14
You’re going to mix in within society?
34:18
And do you know any of your own language, native tongue at all?
34:23
I do know some.
34:24
I mean, I can count and I can say the months and I can name body
34:30
parts and [both laugh] , and I can—
34:33
Give me a sample.
34:34
I can ask—
34:35
Can you count to ten for me?
34:46
[Counts
34:49
in Lakota] and I can’t remember five [counts in Lakota]
34:57
I can’t remember nine and I can’t remember 10 [both laugh]
35:00
. Oh well, pretty good, just a sample.
35:03
Yeah.
35:03
Just a sample.
35:05
One thing that, for instance, [speak Lakota]
35:10
, that whole phrase is the equivalent to our word “pepper,” in the – where pepper
35:18
is just a sound that we have caused to be a word to symbolize something, where
35:24
in the Indian language, [speaks Lakota]
35:28
is the actual description of pepper.
35:31
You know, a little round, hard, black, spicy, stony things.
35:36
[Laughs] woo [laughs]
35:37
. So, yeah, we don’t have just a word that symbolizes something.
35:43
Right.
35:43
We usually have words that…
35:46
Describe.
35:46
Describe something.
35:51
Let’s see, what else can I say?
35:54
Hair is… [speaks Lakota] . I heard that a lot.
35:59
“Going to wash my [speaks Lakota] ,” I heard that a lot. You
36:09
know, “you need to wash your [speaks Lakota] .” She was always funny. [Speaks
36:11
Lakota] , I was taught that when I was 10 years old, and this was a very important
36:16
facet to my life and I asked my mother to teach me how to say “I love milk” [laughs]
36:24
. [Laughs]
36:25
. So, though I have not pursued, you know, speaking Indian as my
36:30
second tongue, because it’s a very difficult language [laughs]
36:34
— I was just going to say, that is a very sound – you know, sounds very difficult.
36:36
Yeah, it’s a little similar to German.
36:39
You have a lot of the guttural—
36:41
I was just going to say…
36:41
—half swallowing your saliva and then quick, getting out these
36:45
syllables, you know, kind of things.
36:46
Right, mm-hmm.
36:46
And a lot of nasal kind of, nasalizing your Ns and things like that.
36:54
So, as far as the language, I know little to nothing.
36:58
You know, it’s – again, it’s very complicated where you even have different
37:05
words for, say, if you’re describing something as being red you would say one
37:11
thing, versus the sun was red, you know.
37:17
And even if you’re saying it or you’re saying that someone else said it, you
37:22
know, and all those kinds of things.
37:24
As far as traditions,
37:29
a little bit…
37:34
I kind of have to go back a little bit to my mother’s upbringing.
37:38
Again, of her – she was brought up in a time where she was brought up in
37:44
a school, it was a Catholic school,
37:49
by white priests, white nuns that said Indian was paganism, [Robert tsks]
38:01
Catholicism was right, and that meant suppression of everything that could even
38:10
slightly be connotated as being Indian.
38:12
Right.
38:13
They weren’t allowed to wear any Indian dress…
38:16
Right.
38:17
…paint, or even talk in their tongue, as I recall.
38:20
Right, right.
38:20
Exactly.
38:20
They were forced to wear uniforms.
38:22
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
38:24
[Tsks] so anyways…
38:25
And I think it was difficult for my mother because in her home life,
38:33
though her mother was full-blood Indian
38:38
and spoke only English to the children, having realized that her children were
38:42
in Catholic schools and being expected to speak only English, yet her father
38:49
did not even know English, never spoke it when – in dealing with his children.
38:54
He only spoke, you know, native tongue.
38:57
So, the children were yet expected to respond to their father as Indian
39:02
children, yet in turning around – you know, so after a while that became
39:09
only on vacation times, and for the other whatever, nine months out
39:13
of the year, they’re expected to act and be little white children.
39:17
So, I think for my mother that was difficult, perhaps even more than
39:22
– she’s the youngest of six kids – I think even more so for her than the
39:27
others because she was right, you know, her age people were right at a
39:36
little bit of a transition time where
39:42
kind of the peak of, as it were, Indian oppression in society – and
39:51
she – so, she was being instilled with all of those “you are not red, you are
39:57
white,” you know, “if you want to be recognized as an individual, you need
40:02
to be a white individual; if you want to prosper as an individual, you need
40:06
to prosper as a white individual.”
40:08
So, she was, you know, being the hardest hit with those things, yet in
40:12
her lifetime we have seen that peak on the downward now, where – and I
40:21
don't know if it’s just pretentious or not – but there’s been, quote, “more of
40:26
an awareness,” you know, unquote, that to be Indian is not a bad thing. So,
40:34
she’s had the pull
40:38
of all those education years and having those instilled in her, yet having to
40:43
respond to children that were brought up in a time – or her children, as
40:48
in myself – brought up in a time where it was good to know yourself.
40:53
You know, it was good to be aware of who you were and get to know your roots
40:58
and things like that, which is a lot of what I have been brought up in.
41:03
So, where me responding to those things and asking all the questions, and so her
41:11
needing to respond to the questions of her child, yet her education was such that
41:18
we don’t even talk about that; we don’t even want to recognize that, you know?
41:23
You don’t need to worry about what it was for, you know, to be an Indian.
41:26
That doesn’t need to be a concern.
41:28
You just need to be an A+ student in school and you just need
41:32
to be a well-rounded person.
41:35
It doesn’t matter if you’re an Indian, that kind of thing.
41:39
So, there wasn’t a whole lot of
41:44
real direct let’s sit down and talk about, you know, this ceremony and
41:50
this tradition, and things like that.
41:52
Much more often than not,
41:56
she would answer my questions say inadvertently in that I would say “Hey
42:03
Mom, when we did such-and-such a tradition or rite back home, were we doing it
42:09
because, you know, for this reason?” And she would respond, you know, “no,
42:15
we did it because,” kind of a thing.
42:17
It wasn’t always a…it wasn’t always a positive giving of information.
42:23
Sometimes it was just to get me to shut up [both laugh] , you know?
42:28
Yeah.
42:28
A lot of times.
42:29
What about things like
42:32
bead making, little things like that—
42:36
Well, see—
42:37
—that’s passed down from mother to daughter?
42:40
Again, my mother has all that knowledge.
42:44
You know,
42:47
she knows, or at least knew – I don't know if she can remember a lot of things now
42:52
– but she knew how to do all those things.
42:54
She knew all the traditional food preparation, you know, she knew all the—
42:59
Wow.
42:59
—traditional
43:03
societal dos and don’ts and, you know, all those things.
43:08
And partly just by lack of immediate environment, having moved away from
43:14
the area where she would be, on a daily – at least more-so on a daily
43:19
basis – pursuing those things, she’s forgotten a lot of things.
43:23
And you know, how much that was subconscious or conscious
43:28
oppression, you know, I don't know.
43:30
I did learn some things just by a child’s pushiness, you know?
43:36
Curiosity?
43:36
Yeah, and like “Mom, I’m bored,” and she’d “well here, let me teach you how
43:39
to do something,” you know, something to keep me busy for a couple more hours.
43:43
And so, I learned some of the like leather working.
43:48
You know, just not complicated things, but just more pastimes.
43:52
And in that sense, that is very traditional.
43:55
That is very – that has been going on for centuries, you know, a mother,
44:01
when the child is young, just to keep the child occupied, a mother began
44:06
teaching a little girl to do beadwork and to do the basket weaving and, you
44:13
know, “here, take this cornmeal and add so much water,” and things like that.
44:19
So you know, I received some of that just because I was a child and she
44:27
was a mother needing to keep a child occupied [Robert laughs] , and the
44:31
things that she knew were Indian things.
44:36
But it wasn’t really with the intentions of “I need to raise
44:40
my child…I need to raise my child an Indian” sense and attitude,
44:50
and things like that.
44:51
As I asked you before, what do you think is going to happen with situations – do
44:57
you feel that the Indians are having to leave the reservations and that
45:02
they’re going to lose their traditions, as in what happened in your family?
45:06
Mm-hmm.
45:08
Um…
45:08
What do you see as what’s going to happen to the American Indian?
45:16
[Clears throat]
45:17
… Are they going to melt into society?
45:20
I think
45:24
in a lot of things we’re kind of stuck between a rock and a hard
45:27
place because…you know, for centuries Indians – and this is true, again, for
45:37
any culture – we have our old mold.
45:40
You know, we come kind of in our own shape.
45:43
And by external circumstances, suddenly we were expected to be
45:47
thrust into a shape that was not ours, you know, as far as reservations.
45:54
You know, that was such an alien concept to us, of whites
45:58
staying in just one place.
46:01
You know, we will misuse our privileges, you know, we will abuse the land here.
46:06
We need to move on and give this place a chance to recuperate and things like that.
46:12
And suddenly these white people were coming and saying “we give this land to
46:17
you, it is now yours; it can never be taken from you,” where words like “taken”
46:22
and “it is now yours” and, you know, “we give it to you,” those were totally alien
46:30
concepts to, yet to survive we needed to incorporate those into ourselves so
46:36
that we could see to it that well, we don’t have much but we do need to make
46:42
sure this land isn’t taken from us.
46:44
You know, we do need somewhere to live, even though that kind of basic instinct…
46:52
So, in some ways, I think we have irrefutably lost some of the pure
47:04
philosophy – and that’s partly just by external circumstances – we can never
47:11
again live the way that we used to.
47:14
And because we cannot do that, we cannot maintain a lot of the
47:18
same attitudes that we used to.
47:22
And—
47:25
[tape cut]
47:25
. [Tape resumes] again, just by sheer numbers, a lot of perspectives and
47:31
concepts and ideas and ideologies and all those things of white society have come
47:36
into us where, again, to a degree, we’ve come past a point of ever getting back to…
47:44
Right.
47:45
Okay.
47:47
But on the other side of that, I would argue that though external
47:53
circumstances have changed, a lot of what constituted an Indian
47:59
mentality were internal circumstances.
48:02
You know, internal feelings and ideas and thoughts and environment.
48:10
You know, what went on inside of me versus just what was going on externally.
48:22
And so,
48:26
I think that we need to…Indians, the Indian nation…I don't know, pause and
48:40
reflect on what it is exactly that we think we’re trying to get back to.
48:49
The greatest fear I have is that the white concept of ownership has seeped
48:58
in enough into our way of thought that, in one sense, the waters are
49:06
forever poisoned, kind of a thing,
49:11
again, because at a real basic level the philosophy was such that we
49:18
are just a small part of a greater whole, never that we were above the
49:24
whole and that it belonged to us.
49:27
You know, how can you own something that you are just a part of?
49:34
So, I’m fearful that we have become so caught up in the trappings of
49:42
being an Indian, where I venture to say that, to a degree, ownership
49:51
of the Black Hills is a trapping.
49:54
Ownership of the Badlands is a trapping; ownership of the reservation is a
50:00
trapping, where somewhere along the line we need to keep in balance that, though
50:06
those are external circumstances that we don’t have control over, you know,
50:10
just for survival’s sake, we do need to maintain some kind of authority or
50:16
say over what goes on in those places.
50:19
Yet we need to remember that we maintain that say, but not out of ownership.
50:29
So,
50:33
I see a need for the Indian people to – and I guess I do need to say
50:40
Lakota because there are I think other Indian tribes of the United States
50:45
that have somewhat been able to get back to their roots – you know, and
50:51
in keeping that balance of while our external circumstances state that we
50:56
own the reservation, but internally they need to know that well, we are
51:04
the wardens over this, say, or it has been given into our care for a time.
51:08
You know, kind of a balance.
51:11
And I don't see the Lakota having achieved that at all.
51:16
In going back home now, I see few
51:21
Indians that are satisfied.
51:23
Have you ever been to the – your reservation?
51:25
Oh yeah, we go back home – and even when I say home, that’s usually what I mean – we
51:31
go back home every two or three years.
51:34
Our – we’ve been doing that since I was six.
51:37
That was my mother, my three brothers and my sisters and myself.
51:41
We did that, like I said, ever two or three years, until I was about 13.
51:46
And then after that, as my older brother and sisters got old enough to kind of
51:50
be more independent, it kind of dwindled down to the younger kids, and in the
51:55
last, say eight years, it’s been just Mom and I that have been gone back.
52:00
And then there have even been times during that time when just Mom has
52:03
gone back, and say just because I’ve been in school or something
52:07
like that I haven’t been able to go.
52:09
And now my oldest brother’s married and with three kids, and my sister’s married
52:13
and three kids, and my other brother is, you know, off doing his own thing.
52:18
So, it’s partly just dispersion.
52:22
But Mom, for sure, maintains fairly close ties, you know, bonds, and
52:30
keeps up on going back there.
52:31
That’s good to hear.
52:31
It wasn’t like you totally separated yourself.
52:32
Oh, not at all, not at all.
52:34
In fact, I think that’s something that my mom’s kind of agonized over,
52:42
thinking
52:45
she bereft her children of all familial support.
52:51
You know, she was a single parent, four children, working full time.
52:59
She couldn’t give.
53:01
She didn’t have a lot of extra to give, you know, the motherly embellishments,
53:08
as it were, where she needed to be concerned with getting us clothed and
53:12
fed and for school and things like that.
53:15
There weren’t – you know, there weren’t the birthday parties and
53:21
just even Mom being a den mother, you know, things like that.
53:26
She just didn’t have time for those kinds of things.
53:28
And I think sometimes she felt had she stayed on the reservation those
53:33
things might have been, at least peripherally, been supplied by aunts
53:38
or uncles or something like that.
53:42
So, I think she took very seriously, even though we couldn’t afford it, she – like
53:48
I said, we always took that trip back home at least once every couple years.
53:54
And so, in that sense,
53:59
she realized – and I don't know if it was…I’m not sure what the motivation
54:05
was – but there was a desire in her for us to have a working memory
54:12
and a relationship with our roots.
54:15
You know, so that was important enough to her to see to it that we went, even if
54:20
it meant her going in debt for, you know…
54:23
What was it like for you when you could first realize, you know, the difference?
54:29
Did you feel like an outsider when you first went to the reservation?
54:34
Young – actually, that didn’t really start happening until I got older.
54:40
As
54:43
a child, until I was 10 or 11, for me it literally felt like I was going home.
54:53
You know, I never felt that I didn’t belong there.
54:58
There were times that I felt out of place just by sheer lack of experience.
55:04
You know, we’d go to a pow wow, such-and-such an event would happen, and
55:08
I wouldn’t know why or I wouldn’t know the significance behind it, or I would
55:13
meet a cousin or a second once-removed by marriage and things like that
55:19
and I wouldn’t always understand the significance of the proper behavior in
55:25
meeting this person, you know, and things like that where, in Indian society, those
55:30
things are still very much recognized.
55:33
It’s only been lately, well, a tradition that has always been in Indian society,
55:39
or in many, was that a mother-in-law never addressed her son-in-law.
55:49
They – in all the years that her daughter was married to this
55:52
man, she never spoke to him.
55:54
Huh.
55:54
It was just taboo.
55:55
You know, I can’t even tell you all of the reasoning behind it or how that
55:59
arose, but that was something that was very strongly adhered to until
56:04
just, you know, not very long ago.
56:05
In fact, my mother has even admitted that when my sister got married, she
56:13
had a hard time relating to my sister’s husband for a while because, whether she
56:18
really agreed with it or not, she had been brought up in that environment that
56:24
said you do not speak to your son-in-law.
56:28
So, that was something that she was kind of surprised to find out about
56:31
herself, yet she felt it very strongly.
56:35
So, a lot of things like that I didn’t always know when I went back home, and
56:42
so sometimes I would do the wrong thing.
56:45
I was never punished for it, or never ostracized, but there were times
56:49
when I knew I distinctly felt that my mother was embarrassed by something
56:53
I had done or something I had said, you know, and I was wondering what
56:57
have I done, what did I do wrong.
56:59
And most of the time she would try and explain, and most of the time I
57:04
didn’t understand, you know, because there were a lot deeper, moral
57:10
concepts going on that I had no idea.
57:13
So, all I, you know, “I don’t understand, I don't understand.”
57:16
But again, as a child, you know adults and most of society are
57:22
much more apt to forgive you.
57:25
So, it really wasn’t until I got older, you know, whatever older being where
57:31
society recognizes you as an independently working agent more where now I was solely
57:38
responsible for my actions, you know, where that age where you are expected
57:43
to know things, you are expected to act properly, and if you’re going to a place
57:49
strange to you, you take the time to find out what’s right and what’s wrong.
57:52
And
57:57
I can even remember
58:01
the time, I mean the trip, where that was not true, and then the
58:05
next trip where it was true,
58:08
where there were – I did something wrong, I think, and there was just a
58:14
different feeling of the disapproval where it was a little bit more of a
58:19
“Laurie, you really should know better.”
58:21
You know, and yet I still was kind of falling back on the well, how
58:24
should I know better, you know?
58:26
Yet just by age where in their society their children by that age knew those
58:33
things, and so for me to go back and not know was kind of obvious.
58:40
But
58:42
it wasn’t ever to the point of being ostracized when it came – and that
58:47
was never familial disapproval.
58:50
It was always just out in public or something like that where of course
58:56
my aunts and uncles would know my personal situation, and so would
59:00
know that I didn’t necessarily have the opportunity to know everything.
59:07
And they were always very quick at teaching me.
59:09
You know, when I would say “what did I do wrong?” they’d – most of the time
59:13
they’d kind of laugh and shake their head and say “well Laurie, let me tell you.”
59:16
[Laughs] Yeah.
59:20
So, going home has never been a negative experience for me.
59:24
It’s always been something that I eagerly look forward to.
59:27
And in a lot of ways, there’s a lot of freedom in knowing that you’re
59:33
going to be among people who are a lot like you in mentality and
59:38
in attitude and in motivation.
59:41
You know, I mean some of the real gut-level things as far as just
59:45
thought processes and how you analyze things and how you approach things.
59:52
How is that different to the way I or… [Laurie laughs] not, you know, but—
59:57
No, I understand.
59:59
I’m not sure I can answer that in, you know…
1:00:01
You had talked, before we started taping, about the Indian attitude and motivation.
1:00:10
Can you…?
1:00:12
A little bit I think the bottom line is, again, what I have said before as
1:00:19
part – as far as you would never hear, I think in a true…a true Indian philosophy,
1:00:33
Indian supremacy, the way that the white, the phrase “white supremacy” became so
1:00:40
popular for a while; “white supremacy,” the phrase describing a white mentality
1:00:47
as far as they came as conquerors, they came to possess, they came – “this
1:00:53
is our land now.” There isn’t that equivalent in Indian philosophy, in Indian
1:00:59
thought, at least in a greater sense.
1:01:03
You know, there are the smaller instances of an Indian brave going into battle and
1:01:10
he gains coup, you know, those become his.
1:01:16
He uses those to actually partly define his manhood,
1:01:23
yet, on a much greater whole, they do not have that mentality
1:01:29
of possession and ownership.
1:01:32
And I’m not sure if I can define all the aspects of it but that nearly makes
1:01:44
white mentality and Indian mentality in opposite directions on a – that color
1:01:52
is almost how you look at everything.
1:01:55
Mm-hmm.
1:01:56
I don't know if you can understand what I’m trying to say because
1:01:59
I’m not sure I can describe it.
1:02:04
For instance, if you and I were to go stand at the foot of a mountain and
1:02:11
– with the intention of getting to the top of the mountain, you perhaps – and
1:02:19
again, I’m just using you as a general…
1:02:21
Right.
1:02:21
…I’m not necessarily “you” in specific – once you got to the top, it would
1:02:26
not be out of character for you to say “I have conquered this mountain.”
1:02:30
And look down and look around, yeah.
1:02:32
Right, and say “I am on top of the world now,” you know.
1:02:35
Mm-hmm.
1:02:35
“The world lays at my feet.” Yet, in Indian philosophy, I would never say
1:02:41
that. That is not a concept that…that I could have. For me, it would be…“look
1:02:54
all how much more there is beyond me.”
1:02:58
Yeah.
1:02:59
Where I am just this minute speck.
1:03:03
You know, almost – it’s kind of almost a reverse where maybe in
1:03:09
your typified Caucasian mentality they would see themselves “I’m
1:03:17
above all this now and everything looks so small and undetailed and,
1:03:25
you know, general and abstract,” where
1:03:30
it kind of, in the reverse, an Indian would say…might…well, let’s see if
1:03:38
I can think how I’d say that. They would look at all that and say “and to
1:03:44
think that when I am down amongst it, I am as nothing.” You know, they would
1:03:50
say “there is so much more beyond me.
1:03:53
There is so much more outside of me.
1:03:56
I am just such a small part of a greater whole.”
1:04:01
Wow.
1:04:02
And that…I think that even more is just an example of what I’m trying to say,
1:04:12
but the attitude that’s behind that
1:04:17
really makes, really makes whites and Indians very different [laughs]
1:04:24
, which is partly why we…couldn’t – I don't think we could’ve won.
1:04:33
I’m putting aside numbers.
1:04:35
Mm-hmm.
1:04:35
We couldn’t have won against the white man because we couldn’t combat,
1:04:42
you know, the attitude difference.
1:04:45
We – you were – “you” [laughs] – the white men were fighting with not just
1:04:54
different physical weapons, but they were so motivated by something so
1:04:59
completely different that – to motivate them into actions that would never
1:05:03
occur to a white person because they didn’t have the motiva—the attitude to
1:05:09
motivate them in the same direction.
1:05:11
Right.
1:05:12
Huh.
1:05:17
So, sometimes I find myself dealing with that even today.
1:05:25
I, you know, I do not pretend to aspire to the same
1:05:34
level of philosophy as they did pre-white.
1:05:37
You know, of course, I can easily think in the same way as – you know,
1:05:45
I’ve gotten to the top of mountains and said “look it, I’m above all
1:05:50
this,” [Robert laughs] you know.
1:05:50
So, it’s not that I don't think that way, it’s just that I also have…on the same
1:05:57
deep level, I have an understanding of having stood on that mountain top and
1:06:02
say “look how much beyond me there is.”
1:06:07
Wow.
1:06:07
You know.
1:06:10
And so, sometimes that has hindered me in say pursuing things,
1:06:20
where I do not always possess the same competitive, say, type of a spirit.
1:06:31
And—
1:06:33
Not always go, go, go, go, strive, strive.
1:06:35
Right, right.
1:06:36
Motivate, get to the top, you know.
1:06:36
Right, where for me—
1:06:38
We’re going to step on everybody, I don't care, me, me, me, you know.
1:06:41
Exactly.
1:06:41
My sense of self is not so intimately defined by what I
1:06:46
own or what I have accomplished.
1:06:48
Again,
1:06:52
this is on a – more on a theoretical basis, because I have been known to
1:06:56
claw and kick a few times [Robert laughs] myself [laughs] . But
1:07:03
there have been times when
1:07:06
I have not known how to completely, properly,
1:07:16
act in white society, where I have felt just an alien sometimes.
1:07:26
And there have been times when I’ve actively rebelled against that, where
1:07:31
I’ve been thrust into a situation that if I wanted to, say succeed in
1:07:37
it or, you know, whatever your measure of accomplishment is, I would need
1:07:43
to…perform in such a manner or put forth in such a behavioral pattern,
1:07:53
and I have felt that to be…opposed to what I would feel inside of myself.
1:08:03
And so, I have said “no.” You know, if
1:08:08
in accomplishing such-and-such a deed I compromise what’s going on
1:08:15
inside of me, it’s just not worth it.
1:08:18
And so, in a lot of ways my life is not exemplified by…you know, I
1:08:25
have not led a typical successful, prosperous white society life.
1:08:35
I’ve been – well, I don't want to say accused, but okay, like an example is that
1:08:42
even though I am nearly 25 years old, I have not even gotten a bachelor’s degree
1:08:47
yet, and that’s partly because…you know, it has not been so important to me that
1:08:59
I attain this bachelor’s degree; that I own this sheepskin [Robert laughs] , that
1:09:05
I have behind my name “B.S. in Zoology.”
1:09:10
You know, that hasn’t been as important to me as – in fact, school
1:09:15
has much more been a background for things that are going on in my life
1:09:21
otherwise; the people that I have met,
1:09:26
the learning that I have done, you know, educationally, socially, all those things.
1:09:34
So, it doesn’t bother me that, you know, even though I’m almost 25,
1:09:38
I’m still pursuing a bachelor’s where most kids my age are – nearly
1:09:44
have their master’s, because
1:09:47
that sense of ownership, that sense of needing to possess something to
1:09:51
define me by is just not as acute in me as in maybe a lot of other people.
1:09:58
Huh.
1:09:58
What does it mean to be an Indian to you?
1:10:05
I think a little bit the defi—my definition of that I’ve kind of
1:10:11
scattered throughout all those things, throughout this whole interview.
1:10:16
And to me, again, it’s mostly an attitude where, for now anyway,
1:10:29
there’s enough external pressures that we don’t – we can’t really afford to pursue
1:10:39
a lot of the outward manifestations of what the attitude should be on the inside.
1:10:43
Mm-hmm.
1:10:44
Okay, that’s kind of a peripheral definition.
1:10:49
And what I mean by that is…for me, to be an Indian does not mean that I will own
1:10:59
my own 12-foot diameter teepee [Robert laughs] . And it does not mean that I will
1:11:04
necessarily have a name-giving ceremony done before I’m age 25, which is very
1:11:10
unlikely now because I will be 25 in two days, which is a tradition for a woman.
1:11:18
It does not mean that my hair will be down to my waist and will be
1:11:23
worn in braids, as you can see.
1:11:26
It does not mean that I own a traditional buckskin dancing dress, you know.
1:11:33
There are a lot of things that it doesn’t mean for me, and for me, most
1:11:39
of those things are the manifestations.
1:11:43
I do feel that…and again, this is still, you know, all exploratory for me.
1:11:55
I am only 24 [both laugh] , so there’s a lot about life and just being
1:12:01
a human being that I don't know.
1:12:04
Yeah, I think there is a lot about me in personality and attitude and motivation
1:12:10
that is Indian, so it’s a little bit hard for me to sit down and say “this is what
1:12:15
defines Laurie LaPointe as being Indian” because to me that’s analogous to trying
1:12:21
to, okay, describe Indian religion.
1:12:25
They are one and the same for me.
1:12:27
I – a large – okay, what I can say is that a large part of what defines
1:12:33
Laurie LaPointe can be typically defined as say Indian personality
1:12:42
characters, you know, or attitudes.
1:12:45
I
1:12:47
have a tendency to be stoic.
1:12:50
I have a tendency
1:12:54
to not pursue, say, male-oriented activities.
1:13:01
Not to say that I stay home and bake bread all day [Robert laughs] , not
1:13:05
that at all, but I’m not – you know, I don't need to say compete all the time.
1:13:19
I’m usually more analytical in my approach.
1:13:23
I am not an extremely emotional person.
1:13:28
I have a fairly dry sense of humor.
1:13:32
You know, so there are things that you can say in my mind this is what
1:13:36
I typify as being Indian, and I will possess a lot of those things,
1:13:44
but to look at my outward life, you might not necessarily even know.
1:13:51
Hmm.
1:13:53
So, at this point in my life I’m more adept at defining Laurie LaPointe
1:13:59
as being an Indian as what she’s not [laughs] , you know, by what I’m not
1:14:06
more than by what I am…because for me to say “Laurie LaPointe is an Indian,”
1:14:14
all I can say is “Laurie LaPointe.”
1:14:16
Mm-hmm.
1:14:17
All I can I say is “I am this way, this way, this was, and this way.” And…because
1:14:25
I’m Indian, I guess that’s what it means for Laurie LaPointe to be an Indian.
1:14:29
Mm-hmm.
1:14:30
What the – how I met you was through Northwest Hills Bible Study
1:14:37
in School of Christian Learning.
1:14:41
How do you – how did you become a Christian?
1:14:45
And
1:14:47
I know that through a lot of my books they blamed the plight of the
1:14:52
American Indian on Christianity; how can you…can you define that
1:14:58
for me a little bit, go into that?
1:14:59
Yeah,
1:15:02
a little.
1:15:03
[Robert laughs] . Again, this is all just kind of personal conjecture.
1:15:08
I became a Christian when I was 13 years old, Christian being
1:15:13
defined as a born-again personal relationship with Jesus Christ, though
1:15:21
I was brought up in a devout Catholic environment, went to
1:15:27
church every Sunday, took communion every Sunday, went to confession
1:15:32
at least once a month, all of the
1:15:37
external manifestations of what should have been going on
1:15:41
internally but wasn’t always.
1:15:46
And I became a Christian when I was 13 years old, under the influence of my
1:15:53
eldest brother who had become a Christian a couple years before and has since then
1:16:00
become a pastor and has his own church, a
1:16:06
nondenominational, semi-charismatic Evangelical church up in
1:16:11
Vancouver, Washington.
1:16:16
For me, that was – I did have some hard times.
1:16:21
At 13 years of age, I was just trying to not only realize I’m a little
1:16:31
different from some people, I kind of wonder why; “hey, I see some Indian
1:16:38
qualities about me,” you know, not only was I coming into that kind of an
1:16:42
awareness, but also just your normal human development of “who am I, where am
1:16:47
I going, what defines Laurie LaPointe?”
1:16:54
And in so discovering – you know, at first just in taking bulk knowledge, as it were,
1:17:03
about Indian society in history, and even the anthropological aspects of it, even
1:17:09
all those kinds of things, and in just learning some aspects about Catholicism,
1:17:17
and in just learning some aspects about
1:17:21
Christianity and where I saw differences in Catholicism and…a greater concept
1:17:31
of Christianity, and yet learning the philosophies of Indian lore and,
1:17:38
you know, all those things, that was a hard time for me of trying
1:17:43
to harmonize all those things.
1:17:48
And in going back and saying “wait a minute, it was supposed to be Christianity
1:17:53
that was supposed to be enlightening these people,” and having heard, you
1:17:57
know, what you just expressed of it’s the Christianity, supposedly the Christian
1:18:03
church that just nearly destroyed, you know, many Indian cultures, and so trying
1:18:09
to bring all those things in balance, I don't pretend to make excuses for all
1:18:16
those people, and I certainly can’t know their hearts and their minds, but I do
1:18:23
know that…in particular, the Catholic Church, you know, which was the main
1:18:32
influence in South Dakota, pre-Vatican II Catholic, very staunch, Roman Catholic,
1:18:43
couldn’t have been more diametrically opposed in thinking to Indian thought.
1:18:51
So, in that sense of the word, I do place a lot of responsibility
1:19:01
on the Catholic Church.
1:19:03
I could go into all sorts of discussion on what I perceive to be the differences
1:19:11
between the Catholic Church doctrine of that day and true Christianity.
1:19:18
Um, we—
1:19:19
Right.
1:19:19
That’s just like in our class; a lot of things get blamed on the missionaries,
1:19:28
and they kind of put the explorers and the adventures into that group of
1:19:33
missionaries, whereas maybe our definition of a missionary isn’t someone who’s
1:19:38
not out to conquer these people and…
1:19:44
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
1:19:44
…trying to change their lifestyles or their traditions, you know?
1:19:49
Right.
1:19:51
Right.
1:19:54
Because [sighs] for me…in some very important fundamental ways, as far
1:20:06
as attitude, Christianity and Indian philosophy are very compatible.
1:20:13
Yeah.
1:20:13
When—
1:20:14
Very compatible.
1:20:15
Earlier in this interview when we were talking about religions, I saw a lot
1:20:19
of undertones within the – your —you know, traditional Sioux religion,
1:20:26
you know – that are some of the basics of Christianity, you know?
1:20:32
Mm-hmm.
1:20:33
And I can’t – I too become very upset when someone doesn’t go in and
1:20:39
learn the culture first, you know, and sees that the underlying things
1:20:45
that they believe is the same thing…
1:20:46
Right.
1:20:47
…as, you know, these people believe in.
1:20:50
So – see, I think a problem is that
1:20:58
when we say the missionaries were responsible for destroying a lot of
1:21:03
the culture, I think what we need to be saying is that these white people
1:21:08
came in, and these white people came in with their white supremacy attitudes.
1:21:14
Missionaries, pioneers, farms, whoever, you know, whatever their title
1:21:20
was, that was – that’s unimportant.
1:21:23
It’s the fact that they came in with their conventional white
1:21:28
attitudes, and that’s what destroyed.
1:21:31
It happened to be that they came in under the title of the Christian workers.
1:21:37
Right.
1:21:37
And I think that that’s where a lot of the friction has come in where…
1:21:46
I don't think
1:21:50
that what they were pursuing was…was bringing these people into harmony
1:21:58
with Christianity so much as conquering them, you know, from their own white
1:22:05
attitudes and things like that,
1:22:09
which is unfortunate because, again, for me I – there’s no conflict in me
1:22:18
of adhering intimately to your typical Indian philosophies and adhering
1:22:26
intimately to Christian values.
1:22:31
They motivate me in the same direction.
1:22:35
If not overlapping, they’re parallel, and they don’t – there’s
1:22:40
no compromise in me for those things.
1:22:45
I guess I would have to admit to the Indian philosophy perhaps in
1:22:52
the pre-white pure sense of the word was that they did worship the earth.
1:22:58
You know, they did worship these other gods, and I do not adhere to that,
1:23:03
yet I bear a great reverence and I honor the earth and I have a great
1:23:08
respect for all living creatures.
1:23:11
I bear
1:23:16
a deep amazement and an awe at nature, and—
1:23:20
Nature itself.
1:23:21
—and the principles that rule it, and the ruling hand behind it all.
1:23:26
There’s no incompatibility there for me at all.
1:23:30
And the two have enhanced the others a lot – each other a lot.
1:23:36
I feel that in some ways I am more of a fulfilled Indian, perhaps, because
1:23:48
of my Christianity, and in some other ways I’m more of a fulfilled Christian
1:23:52
because of my Indian philosophy.
1:23:55
So, I don't see that as a problem at all.
1:24:01
And I know my older brother feels the same way.
1:24:04
As I said, he had become a Christian a couple of years before I did, where
1:24:10
he had been involved with some of the mid–seventy or late seventies, early
1:24:19
eighties radical Indian movements.
1:24:21
He was involved with AIM, which was the American Indian Movement, marched on
1:24:26
Washington, hurled a few stones [Robert
1:24:32
laughs] I think, and—
1:24:33
Got their attention [laughs]
1:24:33
. —yelled a few adjectives and, you know, all of that, and
1:24:40
came to a point of
1:24:43
seeing the incompatibility of
1:24:48
that behavior with what they were really trying to achieve as an Indian nation.
1:24:56
And
1:24:59
then, having become a Christian, and
1:25:06
you know, pretty much completely pushing off the violent tactics,
1:25:11
and I see in him now a real
1:25:18
fulfillment of
1:25:22
teaching.
1:25:23
You know, a teaching in the same sense as Indians would sit down and teach.
1:25:29
You know, I see him teaching his sons and
1:25:36
I – to me it would be – it probably very nearly approaches what
1:25:41
went on centuries ago, you know.
1:25:44
He sits down with his son and says, you know, “let me tell you this story,” and in
1:25:50
so doing, defining a moral or a behavior or a principle or something like that.
1:26:00
So, I think for both of us, you know, a real fulfillment on both aspects.
1:26:07
And again, in the same sense that in Indian philosophy there’s no word
1:26:13
for religion, you know, my being a Christian and my being an Indian,
1:26:21
you can’t differentiate the two.
1:26:23
They are one and the same, you know.
1:26:27
What do you see as… and what do you think, how the Indian’s going to survive?
1:26:38
Let me give an example.
1:26:39
The
1:26:42
Navajo and the Hopi Indians are – the Navajo are getting
1:26:47
pushed off that reservation—
1:26:49
Right.
1:26:50
—and the U.S. government going in and mining uranium ore on a
1:26:58
lot of the nation’s – the oil and the coal – we keep pushing
1:27:04
them off their land; we keep, you know, cutting back on their reservations,
1:27:09
polluting the lakes, you know, how is the American Indian going to survive?
1:27:16
[Sighs]
1:27:18
Is there anything they can do?
1:27:22
Is – are groups like AIM, are they going to help any?
1:27:26
Are, you know…?
1:27:28
I do not perceive that they have done much good
1:27:37
[laughs] , up to this point.
1:27:38
I think the problem, again, is a little bit of at least what
1:27:42
I started to refer to earlier,
1:27:47
you know, the analogy that we are between a rock and a hard place
1:27:50
because for us to survive today…means doing what we have always done to
1:27:59
survive, and that means adapting.
1:28:01
And in this instance, it would mean Indians adapting to white society.
1:28:06
And in so doing, we lose, to a degree, you know, it’s inevitable
1:28:13
we lose some of our Indianness.
1:28:13
Mm-hmm.
1:28:16
How much of that we would lose in the process, I cannot say.
1:28:19
You know, and I guess on the extreme pessimistic outlook; in order to
1:28:28
survive, we end up destroying ourselves,
1:28:32
in the sense of in order to survive against the whites we need to act
1:28:39
on that level, and in so going to that level, we lose our own.
1:28:44
[Unintelligible]
1:28:46
Is that – if that makes any sense?
1:28:47
Yeah, sure it does.
1:28:49
I guess on a positive level is that hopefully, as we are moving along to
1:29:00
putting forth the energies of
1:29:05
needing to be understood, and putting forth the energies of being
1:29:09
understood, hopefully, white society would be moving along the same line
1:29:15
in coming closer to understanding, and so not making us venture so far
1:29:21
from our ground zero, as it were.
1:29:25
And so, maybe if we met somewhere in the middle, we would not be so far
1:29:32
away from our own level that we could not at least recapture some of that.
1:29:36
Yeah.
1:29:37
A lot of what I see and what I’ve learned and I’ve read from this class is you have
1:29:44
the white man’s greed, unsatisfied greed.
1:29:49
You know, he sees something and he wants it, and yet he has given this
1:29:54
land to the Indian and said, you know, “this is yours and yours alone
1:30:00
to govern this,” and yet he sees something on there and he wants it.
1:30:04
And then I see, from the Indian, a stubborn pride, you know, of the
1:30:14
unbending tree, and I – unfortunately, what I end up seeing from what I’ve
1:30:20
read about the Indians and what’s going on in the Navajo and Hopi, there’s
1:30:27
no way that they’re going to be able to compete against the white man’s
1:30:31
power, the white man’s government, and
1:30:35
they’re going to end up being crushed, you know?
1:30:39
Mm-hmm.
1:30:39
And totally, you know, repressed.
1:30:42
Yeah, I have a tendency to see it that way too, in that we either lose
1:30:48
externally or we lose internally.
1:30:50
It’s a no-win situation for you guys.
1:30:52
If we strive to maintain the internal, we learn all of the
1:30:58
external manifestations of our life.
1:31:00
You know, we lose any of the land that we would have seen as our place to be.
1:31:08
We lose any of the, you know, the different elements of our
1:31:13
lives, you know, the buffalo.
1:31:16
We have lost the Black Hills to have as our place of worship and things like that.
1:31:25
We have lost…
1:31:28
Yet, if we fight to keep those things, we have external gone to the white
1:31:37
man’s level and lost our internal.
1:31:40
You know, the… You know, in other words, agreeing to the attitude
1:31:47
of “this is mine to fight for
1:31:54
and I will,” you know, “to an extreme, I will kill to keep it.”
1:32:04
But unfortunately, if they want to keep their land, like you
1:32:07
said, they’re going to have to…
1:32:10
They have to…
1:32:12
…to do that.
1:32:12
…adhere to behaviors…
1:32:14
They got to fight fire with fire.
1:32:15
Right, right.
1:32:16
And I, you know, our fire can never be as big.
1:32:21
Right.
1:32:22
…as the white man’s fire.
1:32:22
And like you said, in the process, you lower yourself and you degrade yourself.
1:32:26
Right, right.
1:32:27
Or, you know, I don't quite want to go that extreme, just so much
1:32:32
as we go to where we are not.
1:32:35
Yeah.
1:32:36
You know, we just, we jump islands, you know?
1:32:40
Sort of.
1:32:42
Just a different plain, a different way of though.
1:32:45
And you know, you cannot – it is nearly a road to madness, as it were, to try
1:32:54
and behave in a way that you cannot.
1:32:59
And that right there is very nearly the greatest sin in Indian philosophy.
1:33:06
You know, for them, in Indian philosophy, everything that comes
1:33:11
out of you comes…you know, every
1:33:18
action or event comes out of only what can be inside of you, to begin with.
1:33:24
Mm-hmm.
1:33:28
So, for them to say…to exhibit
1:33:37
say greedy behavior implies that there are greedy tendencies inside of
1:33:43
themselves, yet that is diametrically opposed to what their true attitude is.
1:33:51
So, it – that’s literally swallowing their own tail, kind of a thing.
1:34:01
Mm-hmm.
1:34:01
It’s – I don't know.
1:34:01
So, as far as survival [sighs]
1:34:10
… I think it’s going to be hard [laughs] . I…
1:34:18
All I know
1:34:22
is that somewhere along the line we need to keep the balance of being
1:34:28
caught up in keeping hold of the external manifestations, what I
1:34:34
referred to earlier as trappings, some of them, you know, being right.
1:34:43
Keeping in memory a rite and a ceremony versus to have the attitude
1:34:50
behind the ceremony— [tape ends]
