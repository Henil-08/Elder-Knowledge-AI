00:04
And ah, do you
00:09
know off-hand, which ones they were?
00:10
[which tribes were first brought to reservation]
00:14
Well, there
00:21
were many, many.
00:23
But, primarily it was the Rogue River.
00:30
I heard they were brought here after a war?
00:34
1850-1855, yeah.
00:36
And, ah,
00:39
the Chetcos, from California and Oregon.
00:45
And this constituted many, many splinter bands.
00:47
See, the Rogue River had three, three main bands, and out of that, that
00:54
constituted maybe thirteen splinter bands.
00:57
And the Chetcos were primarily the same way, and the Tututnie,
01:01
and the Alseas, and ah,
01:08
then some from the Mid-Willamette Valley were brought here also.
01:13
Were they all pretty much brought here at one time?
01:16
Yeah, within a year or two.
01:23
Then they all eventually
01:27
took the name of Siletz.
01:27
Yeah, Siletz is just a name.
01:29
Of course you hear a lot of the [unclear word] and the writers speak
01:33
of the Siletz tribe which, I guess way back in the 1700's or or something
01:39
like that some whaling vessel or some explorer came through and had
01:42
seen some Indians on the coast, and
01:47
called them Siletz Indians, I guess.
01:49
But that's kind of vague.
01:53
Actually, Siletz is just a name.
01:54
Where did the name come from?
01:57
I was reading and I heard all sorts of different-
01:59
Oh, there's all kinds of things.
02:00
But, my, my information came from my grandfather who
02:08
was brought here, and he was a Rogue River Indian.
02:10
And it was passed down from him, that the terminology of Siletz
02:15
means crooked and winding.
02:18
And to me, that's about as realistic as you can get because our river
02:25
is a very good explanation of that.
02:27
From the headwaters to the mouth, is only 18 miles by air.
02:32
By land, it's 128, so I think it's kind of self-explanatory if the word definition
02:38
means crooked or winding, I think it'd be, fit right into that category
02:44
rather than the myth that a serpent jumped out of Devils Lake with a white
02:48
shawl on its shoulders and it captured a, an Albino Indian and, you know.
02:55
I hadn't heard that one.
02:56
Oh, yeah, well, that's kind of fantasy, you know.
03:01
And they called her Celestia and Celesta [spelling not sure] and all
03:04
this stuff, and some of the British explorers finally come up with a word
03:09
named Siletz or Celeste, or something like that, but that's what you read.
03:16
I don't buy that.
03:19
I'm more apt to believe what my grandfather told me.
03:22
That sounds a little more down to earth.
03:23
Crooked and winding, and I think it's more, as I said [unclear] because
03:31
from the headwater to the mouth is only 18 miles, and by road or the way
03:35
the river goes, it's 120 some miles.
03:39
So, I'm more inclined to believe that.
03:42
Yeah, Okay, on ah,
03:46
And at times, in question, that in again is kinda a vague area,
03:51
but at one time they claim there was 36 different tribes brought
03:59
here.
03:59
And, I wish I was a little more prepared than what I am.
04:01
I have a,
04:08
ah, roll of 1835, a names and tribes, and maybe later on I could get this for you.
04:15
It may be of interest to you.
04:16
They have census's at the library on microfilm.
04:19
Would that have the-it has the names of people.
04:20
I haven't looked at it yet, but I think it tells the
04:25
families-
04:25
It could, yeah, it could.
04:27
This here has been a broken down form of the families that
04:30
were registered here in 1885.
04:32
According to the tribes?
04:34
According to the tribes,
04:39
yeah.
04:39
In 1849, I read somewhere that there were only 12 Siletz, that there was
04:43
a pure band of Siletz Indians, but in 1849 there were only 12 of them because
04:51
of an epidemic.
04:52
Have you heard anything about that?
04:53
Well, yeah, but still again, that's a very, very vague statement.
05:00
But, I heard that there was actually a "Siletz" tribe.
05:03
We, l yeah, but
05:07
that's-I'm inclined to believe this too, that, due to the
05:09
folklore of our elders, that, ah,
05:13
I also learned that
05:19
the first known Indians that was known here, even by then that used to
05:25
migrate from California to the Columbia River, and vice versa, even from
05:30
clear up to British Columbia and down.
05:34
This particular tribe was called the Flathead tribe, Flathead Indians.
05:41
These are the ones that they're seeing--
05:41
- These are the ones that they're speaking of.
05:42
And, here again, I believe
05:49
this too.
05:49
And I think there was a migration of Indians that migrated here from various
05:53
areas and more or less kind of settled here because Indians at that time
06:00
themselves, were like nomads of the coast
06:07
because they had access, there was no limit to where they wanted to be.
06:15
And ah, you know, as far as the Siletz tribe is concerned or the Alsea
06:18
River, Umpqua, or whatever--and the writers and philosophers they, a lot
06:24
of times they would come ashore-I
06:31
think the only ones that had real good documentation was the
06:35
Hudson's Bay trappers, that really did negotiations and business and
06:40
tradings with the Indians that were established inhabitants of the area.
06:46
Rather than a myth of "I'd seen a bunch of savages running through the brush
06:50
and we'll call them this, you know".
06:55
It was folklore, you know, and I'm inclined to believe this, that in
07:01
the migratory system of the coastal lands, that there were intermarriages
07:09
even before there was such a name as intermarriages among these people.
07:16
Even though there may be a bilingual language barrier, but I still think they
07:20
had this type of a relationship because our folklore tells us, particularly in
07:28
the basketry, that some tribes along the Columbia River have the same arts
07:36
as some that were in this area and in like, Crescent City, California.
07:41
So therefore, somewhere along the line, unless it was a gift of the
07:46
"Great White Father'' that made these people have so many things in common.
07:53
But, they are identified as such.
07:57
You know, so here again, I have to relate back to the old stories
08:04
that you hear in our folklore.
08:06
It's kind of passed down.
08:06
What are some
08:11
of the old stories you've heard about the life on the reservation, or any-
08:15
It was miserable.
08:17
I heard the first couple of years a lot of people starved.
08:19
They did, and they deliberately starved them.
08:22
Oh, they did?
08:23
Yeah, because,
08:27
see, when they first brought them here it was something similar to the
08:30
"Trail of Tears" when they moved back East, with the Cheyennes and them
08:34
people; white settlers, and Indians and all, and they marched them.
08:38
They did the Indians here the same way.
08:41
They took them up to the mouth of the Columbia and drove them like herds
08:44
of cattle without proper provisions.
08:47
Everything that they, their household goods were thrown overboard and so on.
08:54
So, when they got them on these ships, they were, what they had on their backs.
08:59
And the provisions were poisoned to eliminate, because, see, the
09:05
Rogue Rivers in particular were warlike, they were defined as
09:12
the savages of the coastal area.
09:16
And, ah, so this is why many of them never really got here.
09:21
Some split, some went back down there, some was directed in a different
09:25
area, such as the Grande Ronde.
09:27
Some of them located in the Grande Ronde area, with the inland, Willamette Valley
09:33
Indians, the Kalapuyas and so on, you see.
09:37
And there again, they integrated after a passage of time.
09:41
Was
09:45
there some on the Alsea?
09:46
Wasn't there a reservation?
09:47
Ok, there was Alsea, yes.
09:49
And,
09:52
this here again was one of the native bands of Indians, that this was
10:01
their inhabitance.
10:02
They were not a nomad tribe, then?
10:03
No, this is their aboriginal grounds, and I think, thinking back over history,
10:10
and writings and readings, I think that was one of the biggest Indian
10:16
entities on the coast, was the Alseas.
10:20
And they, again, were imprisoned and moved off of their lands,
10:26
and therefore they inherited the
10:33
[unclear] of the Tillamook Indians which constituted the Tillamook area.
10:41
And they
10:44
had nine or thirteen splinter bands of the Lower Tillamook,
10:50
which constituted the Alsea Indian.
10:55
Oh, the Alseas were a split from the Tillamook?
10:56
Well, they were moved.
10:57
See, they were held prisoners on their own aboriginal grounds,
11:03
then they were moved, I think
11:06
many of them moved back.
11:08
But under the treaty [unclear] of the United States in
11:16
1855 and clear through to 1875, that they were declared a
11:23
Tillamook band: Tillamook band of Alseas, or whatever, whatever.
11:26
They used so many definitions that-but they called them a splinter band.
11:33
In the Upper Tillamook, were the Nehalem bands of Indians, Nehalem
11:38
and Clatsop, which run to the Columbia River and even across the
11:43
Columbia River because that was--.
11:48
The terminology of boundaries was completely meaningless to the Indians.
11:52
I mean,
11:55
the concept of fables that drew these imaginary lines to define
12:03
counties, states, or whatever.
12:05
See, to the Indians, it was meaningless.
12:07
If you come from over there, you come from over there, regardless of
12:11
whether it's Oregon City, or whatever.
12:13
You know, if you come from Crescent City, you come from down there, you know.
12:18
So there again, I think it's in a writer's dreams of interpreting
12:25
whatever you want to interpret, frankly.
12:28
And this is where a lot of it's misleading, from the early
12:32
terminology or definitions.
12:41
Have I got you completely confused?
12:42
Maybe when I turn the tape off, I can figure it out.
12:44
Which tribe are you from?
12:50
Rogue River, and Molalla.
12:52
My
12:56
grandfather was Rogue River and my grandmother was Molalla.
13:00
And the Molalla I'm speaking of was the ones that were around the area
13:06
of Molalla, Oregon and Oregon City.
13:08
Not the Molallas which is your southern band down in Southern Oregon.
13:15
They were two different bands, and there again the pronunciation is
13:23
kinda twisted.
13:24
Are they spelled
13:26
the same?
13:26
Well, similar.
13:28
See, one is even in common language is Molalla [pronounced Mo-lala] and the
13:34
other is Molalla [pronounced Mole-L].
13:36
They're spelled the same, but in the eyes of the federal
13:40
government, it means the same.
13:52
Oh, they're the same according to them?
13:53
The same people.
13:53
I noticed that there was some kind of government order in 1875 to
13:55
remove the Indians off the Alsea.
13:58
They did, they abrogated, done away with completely, of the
14:04
Alsea band at that time, 1875.
14:07
Why didn't they do the Siletz?
14:07
It said they were going to on the order.
14:12
Okay, what they did at that time was split the reservation in half.
14:17
Rather than annihilating them completely, they just took half their land away.
14:21
Yes, there was a million acres?
14:25
1,439,000 acres on the original reservation.
14:27
So, was that the first cut they made on the reservation or was there more.
14:30
Yep, no that was the first cut.
14:33
Then, in 1884, they recut it again.
14:37
They took 25 miles plus, I think five miles
14:45
of the rivers, of the Yaquina, Alsea, and Umpqua rivers, and opened
14:51
it up to settlement for settlers.
14:55
And the railroad company did this, through negotiations with
15:00
whoever it is, I don't know.
15:02
Hogg?
15:03
Wasn't it Hogg?
15:04
Wasn't his last name Hogg that was trying to put a railroad through?
15:08
I'm not sure if it was in this area.
15:11
Oh, I don't recall, I don't recall on that.
15:20
But, Palmer, Joe Palmer was the one, I think it was Joe Palmer, the one that
15:24
did the negotiations with the Indians.
15:27
As a matter of fact, he was the one that had them pretty well stabilized
15:32
in the areas that were designated for them, when he was removed, well
15:37
everything went to pot and pieces.
15:39
He was working for the government?
15:41
Yeah, he was the agent.
15:43
The superintendent of the Indian affairs, or whatever.
15:48
But once he left, was that when they ordered the land cut?
15:49
The first one?
15:49
Well, yeah.
15:49
I think that's - the first land cut came after
15:55
he was removed.
15:56
Getting back to the
16:06
early, history, I mean what life was like on the reservation at first
16:10
- It was hell!
16:13
Were there missionaries?
16:14
I talked to a grandson of one of the early missionaries here, and he couldn't
16:19
remember, he couldn't remember that much
16:27
about what his grandfather actually did, but-
16:27
There was, periodically, and basically, I believe most of them went to the Catholic
16:33
type religion in the early days, other than their own particular type belief,
16:43
which many of them went away from.
16:47
And they were - well, see the government's intent was, "We'll build you a school,
16:53
we'll give you a mill in four years time, you'll be educated and you'll
16:58
be able to compete in this world of progress." Well, this never happened.
17:04
"We'll teach you religion." They had the Methodists here, and
17:07
they had the Catholics here.
17:08
Of course they had the Shakers, which is a, apparently a foundation of something
17:15
that was brought here from the East Coast.
17:20
What exactly is the Shaker church?
17:21
There's still one here, isn't there?
17:22
Well, yeah, there's one [unclear-tells where it is].
17:27
I couldn't really define it,
17:33
define it completely other than the fact that, ah, that it was a strong belief
17:39
of the Indian people, whether, ah.
17:42
It doesn't really follow the set rules of the Quakers, or whatever
17:45
they, were over on the East Coast.
17:48
Maybe the names were the same, but I don't think the beliefs or the
17:53
philosophy behind it was the same.
17:59
There's only four or five of them on the West Coast now.
18:01
Yeah, in Crescent City, and there used to be one here, and you take up
18:04
in Nehalem Bay and up in Washington and a couple of other places
18:08
still follow the Shaker religion.
18:12
They don't have services here now?
18:13
No, no more.
18:14
You see, these people have all gone.
18:15
They've all gone to California, or up
18:19
north.
18:21
They haven't had a Shaker service here for, oh, many years, oh, eight
18:27
or ten at least and maybe more.
18:34
But I want to go back to the Catholic again, I'm talking about the late 1800's
18:41
and early 1900's because the town of Depoe Bay, for example, in Lincoln
18:48
City, was built by the Indian people.
18:50
The highways as well as everything else, and they lived in the Catholic mission
18:59
there.
18:59
Wasn't that area on the reservation then?
19:02
It was the reservation.
19:03
Because it encompassed the [unclear].
19:04
The whole coast, [unclear].
19:05
All of it?
19:05
Yeah, ah, anyway it was from Tillamook down to Cape
19:24
Perpetua, down south, was the boundary.
19:30
What is, well that historical marker on the side of the road for Depoe Charlie?
19:33
Do you know anything about him?
19:34
Down on where?
19:35
That was a family.
19:39
Now, ah, that's kinda a-I'd have to refer back to my notes or wherever I put that.
19:41
See, Depoe Charlie I believe was originators on the Yaquina Bay and
19:59
I believe
20:07
that ah-.
20:12
And there was another man here by the name of Charlie Depoe.
20:14
He wasn't the same man?
20:17
Not the same man.
20:18
See
20:21
one was an educated
20:27
teacher, he was a school teacher.
20:31
And, the other one, he was a businessman.
20:34
And I don't know if both these people were Indians or not.
20:36
I know one of them was.
20:39
They said they didn't know-
20:43
Charlie Depoe was a teacher.
20:43
Charlie Depoe was?
20:43
Yeah.
20:47
Either on the marker or on another source I got, it said
20:50
that he was either associated with the early day army, or was a-
20:55
Well, I think he was a British, and not British, yeah, British soldier.
20:59
But I think he had something to do with the first founding of, of the
21:05
first fort on the Yaquina River.
21:07
Now, that may not be true either, I'd have to refer back.
21:13
-When we talk about the same two people, now, that confuses me too.
21:16
Do
21:19
you know which one is which though, in your notes?
21:22
Yeah, well, Charlie Depoe definitely was an Indian.
21:27
Depoe Charlie, whether he was or not, that I couldn't say off hand.
21:29
[unclear sentence about his notes]
21:29
If I, ah,
21:41
the missionary that I was talking with the grandson of, he was either
21:49
with the Brethren church or Methodist.
21:52
Was there a Brethren church?
21:53
It'd have to be Methodist.
21:55
There was no Brethren.
21:57
No, either Methodist or Catholic, were the only ones that
22:04
I ever heard of.
22:13
And, I believe the Methodist was one of the first, because he was a
22:17
traveling person, that just traveled.
22:21
He was a circuit rider for a while.
22:26
Yeah, that's it.
22:27
And, then he came back and I guess he lived on the reservation from 1891 to
22:33
1901, and then he went back to Toledo.
22:34
It was the Ellsworths, if that name sounds familiar.
22:38
There's an Ellsworth Pass somewhere around here I think, but he had a hotel
22:44
in Toledo from 1901 until he died.
22:46
But he taught Industrial Arts here and he was a minister.
22:52
Mmm.
22:54
Yeah, that could be true.
22:55
Was
22:59
there one school or were there schools with each of these churches?
23:05
Ah, well, Government Hill for an example was an Indian school, and
23:10
even had many white kids going there.
23:15
Is that the one that burned down in 1939, or, is it still up there?
23:21
No, it, ah, everythings completely removed except the old hospital
23:28
and maybe one other building.
23:30
But the [unclear] school's in Logsden, in the Upper Farm area, and they were only
23:36
four blocks apart, and one was a white school and the other was an Indian school.
23:41
And, that was in the early 1900's.
23:43
I've got some old pictures of that.
23:49
Would you be willing, if I could borrow them maybe, and
23:53
then copy them and return them?
23:56
I won't do it today, but maybe later?
23:58
Yeah, maybe later on we can have another meeting.
24:00
I'll show you a whole bunch of old pictures, and ah, try to define them,
24:06
show you the people, Charlie Depoe,
24:12
them people, and [unclear name]
24:16
and Chief John's people.
24:18
And, these were some of the original inhabitants, original people
24:24
that was brought here of the inhabitants of the Rogue River.
24:25
I do have
24:29
some of those pictures.
24:30
How old
24:35
was your grandfather when he was brought over here?
24:38
Ah, seven.
24:40
I think he was seven years old.
24:43
So, then he lived his whole life on the reservation?
24:45
Yeah.
24:46
He died in 1950,
24:50
50,
24:53
no 69, and he was 96.
24:54
Do
24:58
you know anything about why they closed the reservation?
25:06
Why?
25:09
Well, yes and no.
25:12
Basically,
25:19
the world of progress and automation was coming upon the people and
25:22
the federal, we were completely under federal jurisdiction.
25:26
We were body of people that were even organized as a tribe, but our
25:32
voice didn't mean a hell of a lot.
25:35
The Bureau of Indian Affairs controlled everything that we done.
25:39
And they had the, well, the council was more of an advisory, had an
25:43
advisory capacity rather than a controlling capacity, of chamber
25:49
sales [?] and the sales of allotments which were allocated to all the
25:56
living Indians in 1884 to 1892.
26:01
Which, this all never happened either.
26:03
They only had, I think in the neighborhood of 300 allotments and that
26:08
time they had probably 2000 Indians.
26:13
So, not everybody got an allotment.
26:17
This was in the 1900's?
26:19
1800's
26:23
I knew there were 2000 Indians in-
26:25
See, 18-Well, the Allotment Act opened in 1882, 1884, and closed in 1892.
26:38
The Allotment-?
26:38
The Allotment Act,
26:41
Which entitled to all living Indians at that time, to be
26:46
eligible for an allotment.
26:49
But, it didn't develop, it didn't work that way.
26:53
So then, after 1884, there weren't anymore-
26:56
1892, I believe, I think it was the last, or '94.
27:02
It was one of the two years that they cut off the Allotment Act.
27:11
Then,
27:13
in
27:19
1925, the agency, the government, whatever it was, was taken from the reservation?
27:24
I heard that they, that Indians just kept the land that they had, one source
27:29
said that, and one source said that they-
27:31
Ok, in 1934, they had their Reorganization Act.
27:40
And this is when they defined Siletz as a reservation, or recognized
27:46
the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, and the Grande Ronde agency.
27:57
I think that was in 1934, 1936, one of the two years.
27:58
This was after the reservation had already been officially disbanded?
27:58
No.
27:58
Oh,
28:05
it wasn't?
28:06
No, it was still, what remaining acreage was left was still a
28:11
reservation, which was very minimal.
28:14
At that, at that time, we only had five sections of timber
28:20
land, a 40 acre parcel up here on Government Hill, which nine acres of
28:29
that, ten acres of that was our cemetery.
28:36
And, it was dedicated in
28:39
1910 as the Paul Washington cemetery,
28:44
in 1910.
28:44
See, 1910?
28:45
Or 1917?
28:45
One of the, I can't recall.
28:58
But, in 1910, is when they done away with much more of the land,
29:05
and took away much of it, and opened it up to public domain.
29:11
So, by 1934 and '36, there was very, very little land left.
29:17
Five sections of timber land and 40 acres that I just spoke of
29:22
was the only thing that was left.
29:26
And a little bit that's in the city limits now, the Millside[?] Park is one of them.
29:32
That belongs to the Indians.
29:33
And, they had some water, water rights that
29:39
was established
29:42
way back
29:45
when.
29:45
What were the principal occupations, or whatever of
29:51
the Indians in the late 1800's?
29:52
The mills?
29:52
You mentioned-
29:53
Mills, and farming.
29:53
And that was it, period.
29:54
Has that changed much now, is the mill still here?
29:56
Ah,
30:08
primarily in the 1800's, 1900's, 90% of our,
30:15
90% of our people were in the lumber industry, whether working in the
30:23
logging, sawmill, - or whatever, it had something to do with wood products.
30:31
In all the phases, them days, of what the lumber industry was about.
30:38
Then, in the termination time of 1956,
30:44
we dropped down to about a 45% ratio of working in the lumber industry.
30:51
What year was this again?
30:52
In 1956 we were terminated, from federal jurisdiction.
30:59
That' when they done away with all the remaining land.
31:09
It was finalized et that time.
31:14
And really the---
31:15
[tape
31:17
break]
31:18
....pulp mill over there.
31:19
They've done away with many of the sawmills.
31:21
This
31:23
land, when they terminated all the remaining land, did you get, you got
31:28
to keep what you were on, didn't you?
31:31
No.
31:32
The only thing that you kept, if you had an allotment, that you, was your homesite,
31:42
and you paid taxes like everyone else had.
31:46
And that was yours, but the tribal lands, which was the five sections of timber
31:52
land that I was speaking of earlier, that was finalized, oh, in '52 or '54.
31:59
That was all sold, done away with.
32:03
And, it was divided among tribes, the money.
32:10
And the people, they enrolled in these tribes, got a certain part of the money.
32:15
And none of it, none of it was any too great, the final payments.
32:21
[JT - Lady comes in [Mrs.
32:26
Gregory?] - she was raised in Upper Farm [she's not an Indian] and is "very
32:44
prejudiced on the side of the Indians." She's teaching Indian history during
32:45
the summer school program there.]
32:46
...Harold Mackey,
32:52
and he's a
32:55
writer.
32:55
And, he, you know, he knows some, he don't know a lot, cuz there's
32:59
many a blank spot in the coastal parts, which we're all aware of.
33:07
But, there's many linkages within that book that work within our area.
33:14
[JT
33:18
- Lady talks-she can't be understood on tape when she speaks.]
33:37
A lot of that information is available [unclear phrase].
33:39
But still, there's a lot of, lot of lines, things written between
33:46
the lines, that just make good reading to the reader, you know.
33:53
A lot of the outright truth, and what really happened, very
34:00
little of that's documented.
34:01
Where
34:16
was you at?
34:17
Where was you at there?
34:18
Is
34:22
Archie Ben and Mrs. Streets also-there's a bunch of different
34:27
people reviving the old traditions.
34:30
Yeah, we had summer school here this year, and we had history.
34:35
Mrs. Gregory [the lady mentioned above] was the coordinator for the history, and
34:42
ah, Gladys Muschamp
34:54
and Ida Bensell,
34:57
and Carie Streets, which is one family, is
35:03
bringing back the basketry.
35:04
Are Gladys Muschamp and Carie Streets the ones bringing back-
35:12
And Ida Bensell.
35:15
Ida's the mother of the two, and she's 90,
35:19
she's going on 96.
35:20
I
35:30
guess it was officially over yesterday, and they're going to try to obtain some
35:33
more funds, they're going to try to continue for ten days or three weeks.
35:39
Has it been going for most of the summer?
35:42
The 23rd of June till
35:45
yesterday.
35:46
It was supposed to go until the 25th, but I guess due to the fair, and a few other
35:52
complications, I guess they had to stop.
35:54
I never did get the complete story on why it stopped.
35:57
What were they learning?
35:58
Was it basket weaving, and-
36:00
Basket weaving, beading, singing, drumming, dancing, and history.
36:05
The history, mainly, it involved the coastal area, and
36:10
the Siletz Reservation area.
36:14
See, our intent and I hope we can document enough of this localized,
36:20
that we can introduce it into the school, have it part of the curriculum.
36:26
Whether it would be a block type deal or an elective part.
36:32
And this will take us probably two years to get it solid enough so that
36:35
we can present it to the school system and see if we can get it to happen.
36:42
And, there will be people we will be contacting, Dr. Beckham and this
36:48
person right here [referring to author of a book], and trying to
36:50
fill in some of the blank spots that, that are kind of darkened areas.
36:58
And, see if it fits in with some of the things that we're learning about.
37:03
Because, they too are writers, and most good writers like to
37:07
write on what makes good reading.
37:16
[JT - tape turned off; unrelated part]
37:16
The hospital originated there
37:22
in the early 1900's and some of the people see, in most of your readings,
37:30
the Upper Farm was very greatly [unclear word] in most of your writings.
37:36
Upper Farm?
37:37
Yeah,
37:39
that's and, that's the Logsden area, and many [unclear] that
37:43
you don't even read about.
37:44
And, these people were some of the original people that were brought
37:47
here in 1855, and prior and after.
37:54
And this is Lower Farm, see.
38:01
So, [unclear part]; Siletz in general, when you speak of Siletz in general,
38:05
you could be speaking of Upper Tillamook clear down to Coos Bay or
38:17
Siuslaw, you know, down in that area.
38:21
[JT
38:26
- unrelated talk]
38:26
I had one other question.
38:31
I saw an old picture from 1924, and they called it the "Last official
38:36
Indian ceremony in North Lincoln County" or something like that.
38:40
But, there were a lot of names on it that sounded familiar: Archie Ben?
38:47
and Pat Ben?
38:49
[He responds yes to each of these] Is that Archie Ben's
38:50
father, or is it the same one?
38:50
No, same one.
38:51
Lets see, are any of these people still here: Johnnie Williams?
38:59
William Brown?
39:01
Mrs. Abraham Leggen?
39:01
[He responds
39:07
no
39:12
to each of these] It's the same one then, Archie Ben?
39:13
RR: Yeah.
39:13
How old is he?
39:13
75
39:15
[JT - Lady talks; isn't clear.]
39:29
It said last official Indian ceremony.
39:32
Yeah, well that's another myth.
39:34
I was going to say, if it's being revived so much now.
39:39
So then, they talked about one in the 1950's, so I don't know
39:44
why they said the last official.
39:45
[JT - Lady talks; unclear]
39:45
Well, it was in, it was on Boiler Bay.
39:45
[Mrs.
39:45
Gregory speaks again] Is that why it was called the last?
39:45
[She talks again]
39:45
Yeah, you see,
40:08
they used to have the tradition of the Depoe Bay Salmon Bake, until the late
40:14
'40's the Indians used to have that there, and that again was ripped off.
40:19
By the Jaycees?
40:20
Yeah, well, whoever.
40:23
Really, that's a fact.
40:25
They used to have yearly meetings there, at Depoe Bay?
40:31
Well, they used to have yearly ceremonies there.
40:34
A pow-wow, a salmon bake, and the whole works.
40:41
Because that was one of the most famous localities.
40:43
The Indians came over the hills, spending the days, and weeks, and months
40:51
[unclear part] along this local coast.
40:54
It was most centrally located,
40:57
and so, therefore, it was just the ceremonial grounds
41:01
that they've always inhabited.
41:03
And
41:06
they always met, whether clear up to the Nehalem Bay, or they went down
41:11
the coast to wherever, Coos Bay.
41:14
They migrated, maybe only down to Alsea or something like
41:19
that, and then they'd come back.
41:21
And they'd spend weeks or months, or whatever it took to gather all
41:25
the provisions that was necessary.
41:28
So, the encampment didn't last for one day, it lasted till they filled
41:34
their provisions, their supplies.
41:37
And in the meantime, they were always in festivity, because in the Indian history,
41:43
in the culture, they gave thanksgiving
41:51
whether it was the sun or the moon, or whatever, time had no meaning.
41:56
Time is meaningless.
41:57
I have to
42:08
get the spelling of some of these names right.
42:11
[spells some of the above names] I
42:31
think that will be enough to go on for a while.
42:37
Well, you can kind of
42:41
fill in between the lines, and kind of figure, figure out
42:47
for yourself a lot, I believe.
42:51
There was one other question, I guess, on the, I read one newspaper
42:55
heading, I didn't get the story, but it said, the heading was
42:59
"Siletz Indians seek tribal status."
43:02
Yeah, ok.
43:04
We reorganized in, ah, let's see, 1972.
43:08
And
43:14
we are now introducing a bill in Congress for the Siletz Restoration
43:18
Act, which will, hopefully, restore our federal status.
43:26
And, basically the reason, and the objective behind it, so we can qualify
43:33
for money in many of the grants and funds that are available to the rest of the
43:37
reservations throughout the United State, such as, Health, Education, and Welfare.
43:43
I guess that's the [unclear end of sentence].
43:48
Because when they [unclear part] they even took our identity away
43:51
from us, as Indians, we're "others."
43:54
[JT - lady talks; unclear]
44:00
Are you organizing as the Siletz tribe?
44:03
Confederated Tribe of the Siletz Indians.
44:06
So the,--I also heard that there was a drive to be, like all the different
44:12
tribes, to make them distinct, with their heritage like that.
44:17
Is that-you're not organizing along those lines?
44:19
No.
44:23
Not that I know of anyway.
44:24
There may be another movement somewhere, but basically we're
44:28
[unclear word] in right here in
44:34
our ancestors or whatever had.
44:41
And that's primarily the area that we've been speaking of.
44:45
It used to run 30 miles inland, the reservation.
44:47
How big is it now, the, I mean how much, just
44:52
the 40 and the-
44:53
Well, all that we have now to lay claim to, is the 11 acre
44:58
cemetery plot, that's all.
45:02
No other resources, no other land.
45:06
The town isn't-
45:07
No, the town is, is strictly all city.
45:17
[JT - Lady talks; unclear.
45:18
Then, some unrelated conversation.]
45:21
Because there's only a few remaining old ones [?] left that
45:26
have this hidden in their hearts.
45:28
The Upper Farm?
45:30
Yes.
45:33
[unintelligable]
45:37
And some of these people are not all Indians, either.
45:40
Some of these are some of our early pioneers that were first, first here, too.
45:46
Is that mostly Logsden?
45:48
Logsden area, yeah.
45:51
See, that in itself had about seven different names before
45:53
it was ever named Logsden.
45:55
Had another little town up there that they used to call Rocko[?]
45:59
which you don't read about.
46:01
Never heard of it.
46:01
Did you know, do you know the people, or the history behind that?
46:10
[unclear part at end]
46:11
Well, yeah, I know, from my dad, but I could through all my notes and
46:15
things [unclear part about notes] my grandfather would relate stories, and
46:20
I just enjoyed them, I never wrote them down one heck of a lot of anything, you
46:26
know.
46:27
And that's, that's a lot of history.
46:30
[JT - Mrs. Gregory talks again]
46:36
Yeah, and they tried to segregate them.
46:39
See the
46:44
thoughts behind the whole thing, and it's easy to realize, that anytime you
46:48
bring in more than two tribes that have a bilingual-type misunderstanding, that was
46:57
kind of a set-up by the Federal Government to make them war-like among themselves,
47:04
to annihilate them, to eliminate them.
47:07
You know, this, a lot of writers don't like to write this, but it's fact.
47:12
They tried to
47:15
make them turn against each other, you mean?
47:15
Well, certainly, to eliminate them.
47:17
[JT
47:29
- Mrs. Gregory speaks.]
47:30
Yeah, then they only give them one-third of the, well, not quite
47:34
one-third of the allotment that
47:40
they should have received.
47:42
There were 2,000 some, there should have been 2000 allotments.
47:43
But I think there was only 300 some, or 400 or some.
47:49
400 out of 2,000?
47:50
Yeah, and these were parcels the size of 80 acres to 360[?].
47:57
See, everyone was entitled to an 80 acre allotment.
48:01
But, this never happened.
48:06
Yeah.
48:07
Down on the river down here, someone just bought a 20 acre plot.
48:09
And before they had a chance to know who [unclear word] it, they took it away from
48:13
them - immediately - that was on Coyote Rock country down
48:18
there, that, all of that there.
48:21
There was a legend behind Coyote Rock, wasn't there?
48:30
Oh, there's quite a legend, yeah.
48:30
There's a lot of fantasy there, but I have a tendency to believe what, like I say
48:36
again, what my grandfather told me, that a, like I mentioned earlier, the Indian
48:44
people gave thanksgiving to everything,
48:48
and this was one of their ways of rewarding the river they would leave
48:52
some of their precious gems, jewels, or
48:56
whatever, on this particular rock, because they
49:00
were so instructed by the great spirit, [unclear
49:08
word].
49:08
And it hold true to form even today, in many instances.
49:25
And for the few remaining ones left, they have their way of
49:28
doing their own thing, you know.
49:34
What's that, the legends left?
49:34
The Indians, yeah, in their own type of worship, you recall modern
49:40
day church, they have their own ritual, ritualistic type of worship.
49:50
And if they did it right out here in open public, there'd be no doubt about
49:52
it, they'd probably get arrested, you
50:01
know.
50:01
But, they were great believers in giving thanksgiving, to everything.
50:12
[JT
50:16
- Mrs. Gregory
50:18
lists
50:21
some of the things
50:26
they gave thanksgiving for; unclear.]
50:27
There still is people doing this, then?
50:28
Oh well sure, yeah.
50:29
But
50:46
many of that will never be exposed.
50:50
Because, that again, that belief was intended to destroy.
50:59
To wipe away that thing and get them educated in the world of progress.
51:06
Not realizing that some of the same things that the Indians were trying
51:10
to relate to them, that we're going back to now, if we're going to exist.
51:20
But the, the great leaders of this nation didn't realize that, until now.
51:28
And things are starting to [unclear word] and going back to who's going to survive.
51:36
See, the Bicentennial's coming on soon, they tried to annihilate the
51:40
Indian people, but they have survived.
51:43
All our people, they're still here.
51:47
So now your writers and your
51:51
[unclear word], they want to know "why", and "how", because
51:57
they tried to eliminate them, to annihilate them, but still they survived.
52:00
They can't understand why.
52:00
[JT - [] unrelated talk; dealt with different people he'd been talking to
52:00
about the Siletz Indians - gives out the information with the intent to
52:00
get it back, to receive a copy, for use in history for their schools.
52:00
Doesn't want information that they don't also have to get in some book,
52:00
and lost from his people's access.
52:00
Shares information with the intent they will also have access to it.] RR:
52:14
This game I was talking about [an Indian gambling game] is
52:15
very, very interesting and the only way it can be told is by someone
52:15
who's done it like Archie Ben.
52:16
I couldn't attempt to tell you in detail all about it.
52:18
But, one thing is,
52:43
that's
1:00:13
interesting,
1:00:27
is how they train.
1:00:29
They go without food.
1:00:31
They trained for it?
1:00:31
Oh yeah, just like you would in sports.
1:00:35
They'd sweat, and swim.
1:00:37
Never drink water for 11 days.
1:00:39
Doctors tell you that you can't live that long, but that's a bunch of bologna.
1:00:44
But, this happened, this Is actual, factual.
1:00:53
And,
1:00:55
there, sometimes they'd have a ceremony that lasted two or
1:00:57
three days singing and dancing.
1:01:01
And when they played till somebody won, sometimes that would take
1:01:05
anywhere from two days to two weeks.
1:01:12
Because they laid everything on the line, whether it was gold,
1:01:16
horses, machinery, whatever.
1:01:31
[JT - Mrs, Gregory speaks; unclear]
1:01:33
Yeah, [unclear sentence] You see, that in itself is a
1:01:42
story and a good one.
1:01:43
Really interesting.
1:01:56
And we hope to have a study in here, in this building with Archies, and
1:02:00
he's still got the original game, it was passed down to him by his father.
1:02:05
And we're going to have him give us a demonstration and
1:02:07
go through the whole works.
1:02:08
JT: Do you know when that would be?
1:02:11
Well,
1:02:14
not for sure.
1:02:16
Do you have a phone number, I can get a
1:02:21
hold of you?
1:02:21
I think you gave it to me at the pow-wow, in my other book like that.
