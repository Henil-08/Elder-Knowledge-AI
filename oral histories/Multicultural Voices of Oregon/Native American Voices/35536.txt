00:00
Today is March 9th, 2024.
00:02
I'm here with Cloe McMichael over zoom, and I'm in, Corvallis today.
00:07
Where are you at today?
00:08
I'm in Corvallis as well.
00:10
My name is Jozie Billings, and we are doing this interview as a part of my
00:14
honors thesis project, Beyond the Binary.
00:17
Welcome to the interview.
00:18
Thank you for coming.
00:19
All right.
00:20
Thank you.
00:21
Yeah.
00:22
So, to start, do you just want to reiterate for the interview how you
00:25
identify what your pronouns are?
00:27
Yeah.
00:27
So,
00:30
I identify, I guess, like, as, woman, but
00:38
more of, like, a non-binary woman, I guess, because, like, I don't, I don't
00:44
know, I'm in a weird place with my
00:48
own identity, I guess.
00:48
But I do use she/they pronouns.
00:53
Because I'm trying to move away from, like, being, like,
00:58
gendered as, like a full woman.
01:00
Like I don't want to be seen as just a woman anymore.
01:03
And so I'm trying to move away from like that.
01:09
And that you also said in the survey that you identify as
01:13
two-spirit, is that still true?
01:15
Yes.
01:16
Yes, yes.
01:17
Okay.
01:19
Just wanted to make sure before I started asking you about that.
01:23
So to start, why don't you talk about your childhood for a bit?
01:29
Maybe like when you started to, like, question your gender, like
01:32
what activities you're involved in as a kid, any formative experiences?
01:35
Stuff like that?
01:37
Yeah.
01:38
So I grew up on the, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.
01:45
That's out in eastern Oregon.
01:46
It's right outside of Pendleton.
01:48
And growing up, like, until I was like five, I really didn't know a lot
01:54
about my culture or where I like where I came from or anything like that.
01:59
And then when I was five, like, we really got immersed into, like, our culture
02:05
and like, what we call [Umatilla word] , which is like basically our church.
02:09
And
02:12
during that time, it was like really... that's when I kind of, like, started
02:16
to decide that I wasn't just like, I didn't just want to be a girl anymore,
02:22
because in our culture, it's really like gendered, like men have like their
02:27
roles and then women have their roles.
02:30
And like, I felt so restricted.
02:33
Just like being confined to, like, women's roles.
02:36
I was like, it's felt weird to me to, like, know that,
02:40
like, that's all I could do.
02:41
I couldn't, like, go out and hunt like a man or like I, I wasn't supposed
02:46
to go out and fish like a man.
02:47
And so that's when I was kind of like, maybe I don't want
02:51
to just be a girl anymore.
02:53
And
02:55
so that's kind of when it started.
02:57
And like, I grew up, like mostly just doing those girl roles and,
03:01
like, learning all of those things.
03:03
And then once I got into high school was when I was, like, more taking on,
03:08
like, my two-spirit identity and, like, going into the community and, like, doing
03:15
these male roles so that, like, I could not just be seen as a woman anymore.
03:20
And, it kind of really all fell into place when I was a junior in high school.
03:33
That's when I kind of left the constraints of, like, what my culture said I
03:39
could, could do, and I started to do all of the things that I wanted to.
03:45
And so that's kind of when I, like, took on my, like, two-spirit identity.
03:52
Just because I had, like, this feeling growing up that, like, I shouldn't
03:58
have to choose what I want to do.
04:00
Like, I can do it all if I like, if I can, why not, you know?
04:06
And so that's kind of where it came from.
04:09
Along with, like, my parents growing up, always like, told
04:13
me that they wanted a boy.
04:15
And like, they always told me like, you were our last chance to have a boy.
04:19
And then you came out a girl.
04:20
And so I always, like, kind of had this like, undertone feeling
04:24
of like, I should have a boy.
04:26
And
04:29
like, growing up too, like, my parents would always tell me like, oh, like, this
04:32
would have been your name if you're a boy and like, your dad really wanted a boy.
04:36
And so I would always, like, be trying to, like, fulfill that role
04:40
for my dad of, like, being his, like,
04:46
what's the word like in, "intern-son" almost of, like doing all the things
04:51
that like a son would do and like trying to, like, be that for my dad, not that
04:57
like he was asking me to or anything, but I kind of just, like, felt like I
05:01
needed to fulfill that role for him.
05:06
Yeah.
05:07
That was kind of like where it all came from, I guess.
05:13
Yeah.
05:13
So you mentioned that you kind of started in high school, I
05:17
think it was, you started doing things that you wanted to do.
05:20
What were those things?
05:22
So, like growing up in the culture, like, women are kind of put into the
05:28
role of, like, having to, like, cook and, like, gather the foods and all of that.
05:34
And men are more put in a role of, like having to, like,
05:38
build sweat, which is like,
05:42
cultural thing that we do for, basically like to, to clean our, our spirits
05:49
and stuff and like, they take care of that and like, doing the hunting and
05:53
the fishing and like, learning all of the songs and like, things like that.
05:59
And so I wanted to, like, take on that role to, like, be the provider
06:04
for my, like, my family and like being able to, like, know those
06:10
things, to be able to pass them on.
06:13
Because one thing in my life that, like, I've really tried to do is
06:17
like, learn my culture to pass it on.
06:21
And I like, couldn't do that if I wasn't like a two-spirit like
06:25
I couldn't learn both sides.
06:28
And so that's kind of why I really wanted to like, learn the other side
06:33
of like the songs and, and how to hunt and where to hunt and all of
06:39
those things, in my culture that I wouldn't be able to learn without
06:43
taking on, like, masculine qualities.
06:48
Yeah.
06:49
That's cool.
06:50
So, you mentioned, like, you wanted to learn the masculine roles and you
06:55
saw - or like your you wanted to fulfill that role for your father - I was kind
06:59
of wondering if you had any role models for, like, that type of masculinity.
07:03
If it was your father or maybe somebody else?
07:05
Yeah.
07:06
So, there's, there's one other two-spirit person that, like, I know of in my
07:10
community and like the one moment that I remember, like in high school when I like,
07:16
decided that I was that's what I was, was, I was a part of this, like, art group, and
07:25
we did a lot of, like, screen printing.
07:28
And so, I was doing an art show and this two-spirit man-like, this
07:31
two-spirit person came in and like, was talking to me and just telling me
07:37
that, like, I can be whatever I want to be in, like, really just telling
07:42
me that, like, being a two-spirit is okay and like that being that in the
07:48
community, like, isn't a bad thing.
07:51
Because like during that time and like still now like two-spirit identity really
07:56
isn't prevalent within my community.
08:00
And a lot of people don't like, see it as... there's a lot of homophobia,
08:06
like, let's just put it that way.
08:09
And so, like, he really, like, made me feel okay with, like, who I was.
08:14
And so like, he's basically my role model of like, it's okay to
08:19
be what I want to be, you know?
08:22
So, him and then my uncle, my, my mom's brother has, since I was a
08:29
child, basically like, took me under his wing and, like, taught me all
08:34
that he knows about, like, the, the masculine side of our culture.
08:39
And, he's like, the reason that, like, I am learning how to hunt and
08:46
learning all of these, teachings from the male side of our culture.
08:54
Cool.
08:55
Very fun.
08:57
And I love uncles, they're always so good.
09:00
I know, and he knew from the beginning too, like, when I like came out.
09:05
He was like, that's old news, like I already knew that.
09:10
You really thought you needed to tell me?
09:11
You know, like, well, I don't know, like I felt like I needed to.
09:18
That's awesome,
09:21
so what was your coming out process like?
09:25
Well, I like, was really, really scared to come out to my parents,
09:30
honestly, because my mom, she's really,
09:36
she has like that old style of thinking, I would say.
09:39
And like, I didn't come out to my parents until the beginning of last year.
09:46
And like, I basically, I, like, shaved my head.
09:50
And then my parents were like, whoa, what are you doing?
09:55
Like what?
09:56
And then that's kind of I was just like, yeah.
10:02
Yeah.
10:02
And then I, like, came out to them and they were like, we it
10:05
was really hard for us, honestly.
10:08
We I didn't talk to my mom for probably almost four months just
10:13
because she was, she just wasn't okay with it within herself.
10:18
And, then I had to sit down and have a conversation with her of, like,
10:23
mom, I'm not like, a different person.
10:25
Like, I'm, I've been this, you just know now.
10:29
And once I had that conversation with her, she was much more okay with it.
10:36
She was like, well, since you put it that way.
10:38
And I was like, I've been this since I was a kid, mom, you just know.
10:47
So you said you shaved your head.
10:48
I have also shaved my head.
10:49
I thought it was a great feeling.
10:52
How did that feel like for you?
10:53
And maybe, what were other, like, euphoric things that you have done
10:57
that, like, related to your gender?
11:01
It was like, honestly, so freeing for me.
11:04
Like when I shaved my head, it was just like, I felt like all of the, like,
11:09
layers of, like, not trauma, but like,
11:15
I guess kind of trauma of, like, I didn't know who I was, and like, I wanted to be
11:20
this person, but felt like I couldn't.
11:23
And then once I shaved my head, I felt like I could just be who I wanted.
11:27
And there was no like, there was like, nothing holding me back.
11:31
And yeah, it just felt really freeing.
11:36
And then I think another moment of like,
11:41
euphoria for me and my gender would, would be going back into my community
11:47
with my shaved head and like, taking on a different role than I was before.
11:53
Because going back in, a lot of people were like, whoa, like who are-?
11:58
Like a lot of people didn't know who I was.
12:00
And like, I felt like I was like reintroducing myself a lot
12:04
because they were like, they just like, didn't recognize me.
12:09
And so I think that was like another moment of like, euphoria because I
12:13
felt like I could introduce myself as, like a new person almost, of
12:18
like, I'm not who I was before.
12:22
And like, I guess I still am that, but I'm like a different person now with that.
12:27
Like, as my history.
12:31
This might kind of be the same answer as what you just told me.
12:33
But when have you felt most at home in your body?
12:37
I think honestly, like being in Corvallis was like one of the first times, like
12:43
I felt like okay with, like, my gender and like who I was just because.
12:52
It's just like everyone here is like, so accepting and like, you
12:57
really can just be whoever you want.
13:00
And so I think, yeah, like being in Corvallis and like being able to
13:06
just like, like not have to, like, hide who I am in a way was like
13:13
the most freeing moment for me.
13:17
Okay.
13:18
Yeah.
13:18
How, how else has your time at OSU been for you?
13:24
I think it's been, overall really positive.
13:30
I did have a few moments where, like, being Indigenous, like, not
13:38
not being queer, but just being Indigenous has, like, put some, like,
13:42
pressures on me just from, like,
13:47
folks, like, in classes and stuff, just like saying things
13:50
that are kind of like racist.
13:53
But like my overall experience with, like my gender in Corvallis
13:59
has been like, really, really positive and like, just like helped
14:03
me come out of my shell, I guess.
14:04
And like, yeah, I come out of my shell because being back home, it's like,
14:10
you can't really like, be open as open about it as, like you can here.
14:15
It's more of like the people who accept you, you can be open with.
14:19
But when you're around people who don't accept it, you have
14:22
to like put on this show.
14:24
And so, yeah, being here is like, I can just be me all the time.
14:31
Can I ask what your major is?
14:34
I have a double degree in history and ethnic studies with
14:38
a minor in Indigenous studies.
14:41
Wow.
14:42
Oh, what do you, what do you want to do with that?
14:45
Eventually, I hope to profess in Indigenous studies and,
14:52
yeah, like, be a professor.
14:54
But if not that, I really love history, and I want to be a historian for my tribe.
15:03
Just because I think that history is really important,
15:05
especially for Indigenous people.
15:07
And a lot of the times, the history that we're recording is in a way
15:12
that's not true to, like, our culture.
15:16
And so I really want to help integrate like, oral history back into, like,
15:24
the way we record history in like, on a reservation and, like, Indigenous
15:30
history, like, in, in a whole, just because oral history is so important
15:38
and like, as you, you know, taking oral history right now, you can get so much
15:43
from it just from like an hour interview.
15:45
And I think it's really important to just, like reintegrate that
15:49
back into like recording history.
15:53
Yeah, that sounds really cool.
15:55
Yeah, oral history is great.
15:56
I have done a lot of these interviews.
15:58
So,
16:01
you mentioned that you, like, felt more comfortable being who you, like
16:05
coming out of your shell in Corvallis.
16:07
So, like, how do you think it would be if you went back, like, if you
16:10
were to be your tribal historian and you lived there full time?
16:14
I think it would definitely be.
16:16
There would be a very long like transition period of like me having to like tell
16:23
people like, no, like I'm, I'm not a "she" like, I go by "they" and like
16:31
a lot of that turmoil of like people accepting who I am and like not like
16:38
reverting back to like, who I was, just because, like, even like for my
16:45
mentor that I was talking about earlier.
16:47
Like, they go through a lot of,
16:51
times in their community where they're like, just not going to go to that because
16:56
like a certain ceremony because they know, like people will be there that
16:59
are going to like, call them by their dead name and like, say these things to
17:04
them that like, just are unnecessary.
17:07
So, a lot of like moments like that of going into places where
17:11
I know, like it's not going to be the most positive, but like, I have
17:16
to put myself in that position to make those other people understand
17:20
that what they're doing is wrong.
17:21
Yeah.
17:24
Yeah, that makes sense.
17:27
This is not really the greatest transition, but I
17:30
realize I skipped a question.
17:33
Have you been, like, involved in any online spaces or like, social media and
17:37
how have those influenced your gender?
17:41
I mean, like, I personally like I go on social media, but it's
17:46
not like I'm not really that active, honestly, in social media.
17:52
But,
17:56
yeah, I think, being in space, like, in the same spaces as, like my mentor, like,
18:04
on Facebook, has really helped me like, understand like, because they post a lot
18:10
of, like, activism things and just like, about their own identity and like their
18:16
own journey has, like, helped me, me understand my own and helped me realize
18:24
that, like, I'm not alone just because being from such a small place and like
18:32
a place where a lot of people aren't queer, it's, it's kind of like isolating.
18:38
And, so, knowing that, like, I'm not the only person on my reservation
18:42
that's going through this has like,
18:47
made it like, not as isolating.
18:50
Yeah, yeah, that's nice.
18:53
Sorry, that was rude, "that's nice." Okay, so let's talk about your object now.
18:57
What did you bring today?
18:59
I was going to.
19:00
Sorry, I don't have it.
19:01
Let me grab it.
19:02
You're good, you're good.
19:04
I was gonna bring this muffler, and so it's basically, a muffler
19:14
is just like, a big bandana.
19:18
And, I brought this as my object because.
19:26
We use these as, like, head coverings in my in my culture.
19:33
And so when I shaved my head a lot of the time when I was home, I would
19:39
just be wearing this, this head covering, because it kind of in
19:45
a way, like hid what was going on underneath it because it's so long.
19:50
It kind of gives the illusion that you have hair under there.
19:53
And so when I would go back, and when I went back into my community and was going
19:59
to like these ceremonies and things, I would always be wearing this one because
20:05
it was like, it was, like, almost like a security blanket in a sense of like,
20:12
well, if I have this on, like, people won't be able to like, say mean things
20:18
to me or like, it was a way to like protect myself from, like, the homophobia
20:28
that I was going to be like, going into and like experiencing in those spaces.
20:34
And then now I kind of have, like, taken it back to my- back to me and like,
20:41
started wearing them as a way to, like, express myself and, like, use the colors
20:48
to, like, help me, like on a daily basis.
20:51
Remember that.
20:52
Like, it's okay and like, I'm happy with who I am.
20:58
And so, I've kind of like taken it from like a security blanket to, like
21:03
a way to express myself through, like, the colors and, the patterns on them.
21:12
Yeah.
21:12
It's really beautiful.
21:13
Is there anything like particular about the colors or patterns that
21:16
is meaningful or you're drawn to?
21:20
This one specifically, it's the flowers on it.
21:26
One, one like thing my dad always used to tell me when I was a child was like,
21:31
whenever I feel stressed or like, like anxiety, I have to, like, stop and smell
21:37
the roses and, like, smell the flowers.
21:40
And so every time I, like, have those moments of, like, being so anxious
21:45
and, like, feeling like I was going to, like, throw up because I was like, so
21:49
anxious in these, like, in these, like, ceremonial settings that like, I could
21:54
just, like, know that these flowers are on my head and just be like, okay,
21:58
like, let's just take a second and take a deep breath and like, it will be okay.
22:07
That's nice.
22:08
Well I think I've covered most of my questions, is there anything
22:11
else you wanted to share?
22:16
Not really.
22:19
I guess I could share, like, just the way... I guess I kind of did
22:22
that, but just like, the way that I see two-spirit within, like, my own
22:28
identity is like, I see it as a way to
22:33
embody both sides of my culture and, like, both sides, like
22:39
both masculine and feminine.
22:41
And so, I can be masculine and feminine at the same time and
22:48
not have to choose one side.
22:50
I think that's like one of the most important things about, like, me
22:56
being two-spirit is not having to choose which side of my culture
23:01
that I'm going to make important.
23:07
Yeah.
23:07
How do you how do you see your gender?
23:09
I guess, like, not outside your culture, but like, not within the context of your
23:15
culture, like here in Corvallis, maybe.
23:18
Like here in Corvallis, I, I like to be seen as like...
23:26
I like to be seen as the grey area, you know, like, people can look at
23:29
me and, like, not know right away if, like, I'm a girl or a boy, I don't like
23:34
the feeling of, like, automatically like being gendered by someone.
23:39
And so, I like to feel like my appearance and like the way that
23:45
I carry myself doesn't gender me.
23:50
Just because, yeah, I like to be seen as both, like, masculine and feminine.
23:56
What kind of, what kind of clothes or stuff do you like
23:58
to wear, day-to-day basis?
24:01
I wear a lot of, a lot of layers.
24:05
I always wear, I'll always be wearing a long sleeve.
24:09
Unless it's like 80 degrees.
24:10
I'll be wearing a long sleeve underneath a short-sleeved t-shirt.
24:14
And then I always, I don't wear any fitting clothes.
24:18
