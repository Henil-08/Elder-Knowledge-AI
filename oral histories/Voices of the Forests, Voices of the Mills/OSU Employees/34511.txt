00:01
This is the interview with George Brown.
00:03
The place of the interview is George Brown’s office in the College of Forestry.
00:10
The interviewer is Max Geier.
00:11
The time of the interview is 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday,
00:18
the 19th of September, 1997.
00:23
George Brown is the Dean of the College of Forestry at Oregon State University.
00:30
Get this thing going before I forget.
00:33
So, I wanted to start out here maybe with a little bit of background on yourself.
00:36
Okay.
00:37
How you got involved here.
00:38
Ted Dyrness tells me you did your graduate work here at the Andrews in ’63.
00:42
Right?
00:42
Yes.
00:43
I did some of it there.
00:45
I came here after I got out of the military in 1964, and I had arranged
00:56
to work here in the Corvallis laboratory for Ted and Jack Rothacher;
01:03
they were kind of my two bosses.
01:05
And that was sort of an interim position until I began my Ph.D. work
01:13
at Oregon State in the fall of ‘64.
01:17
So, that summer was a very interesting summer.
01:20
I worked on a number of projects, on all of the study watersheds from Coyote
01:27
Creek down at Tiller [Ranger District on Umpqua NF] and the Fox Creek watersheds
01:32
[Bull Run Watershed, Mt. Hood NF] . Did everything from boundary survey to just
01:35
an immense number of soil pits, it seems like an endless number of soil pits, with
01:39
Ted [Dyrness] . And then did a lot of soil physical and chemical analyses of those
01:48
samples that we took out of the pits.
01:50
Everything from
01:57
bulk density to particle size distribution, to some of the pressure
02:03
plate profiles on soil water retention.
02:07
Also some chemical analyses as I recall.
02:11
But it was kind of a complete,
02:14
sort of a spectrum of “soil stuff.” But, we would do other kinds of things,
02:21
instrument chart changing and that sort of stuff, during the summer months.
02:26
And later, I terminated with them, when school began.
02:30
Then,
02:35
my doctoral dissertation was on the impact of timber harvest
02:43
water temperature.
02:44
Basically, I put together an energy balance model for
02:48
predicting stream temperature.
02:51
One of the study sites that I used, which was just an ideal place to do
02:56
this, was the H.J. Andrews Watershed 3, down in the lower clear-cut.
03:03
It was a great place because, if you’re familiar with that stream down there in
03:08
that lower clear-cut, it’s almost like the sun comes on and the sun goes off,
03:14
I mean, it was such that the sun would come up over the stream, and this blast
03:20
of direct beam radiation would hit the stream, and then at four in the afternoon,
03:26
the light turned off, essentially, from the direct beam, and it was great.
03:31
I mean, you didn’t have to worry about the sort of sampling problems with
03:36
patches of shade and patches of sun.
03:38
I mean, it was on or it was off, a great place to do some of these studies.
03:43
So, you did your undergraduate work at Colorado State?
03:47
Colorado State, yes.
03:48
And your masters, also?
03:49
Right?
03:49
Yes, I did.
03:51
If you could talk a little bit about your background and how
03:53
you came to be interested in working out here in the Northwest.
03:58
You started out there in Colorado, so are you from there, or
04:02
-- ? No, I grew up in Missouri.
04:03
So I’ve kind of moved west.
04:07
I got a Bachelor’s Degree in Forest Management, and that bachelor’s degree,
04:15
was a great opportunity at Colorado State.
04:17
It’s a great school, and it was one that, at that time, well it still does, it had a
04:24
number of departments in the college, and you were able to take courses in fisheries
04:29
and wildlife and range and recreation and those sorts of things, and really get a
04:33
very broad natural resources background.
04:39
About the time I entered, started in my junior year, had an opportunity
04:44
to work in the woods a couple of summers, and my interests changed.
04:49
And in part, because of an association with a guy who was a good friend of mine
04:58
and was very excited about the brand-new program in watershed management that
05:01
had just started at Colorado State.
05:05
Mind you, this is back in the late ‘50s when watershed management, there
05:08
were only one or two places around the country that did offer that degree.
05:16
Who was that person?
05:17
Bob Dills.
05:17
Bob Dills.
05:18
Well, he was the professor who led the program.
05:22
And
05:26
Bob was a very enthusiastic person.
05:29
Well, I talked to him about the possibilities of doing a
05:33
Master’s Degree in Watershed Management, or even transferring.
05:36
He suggested that, since I was so far along in my undergraduate program in
05:39
forest management, I complete that degree, use my free elective credits
05:43
to take calculus and some other things that were not required in a typical
05:46
forestry curriculum at the time, and get ready to go to graduate school.
05:51
He offered me a graduate assistantship, and in that master’s program,
05:59
I had just a tremendous education experience.
06:03
It was kind of a young, green kid who was in graduate school with
06:08
a bunch of seasoned veteran folks that had been out and about and
06:15
they were very serious about what they were doing, very enthusiastic, and both
06:20
of those things really rubbed off on me.
06:23
And so I really enjoyed the master’s program.
06:26
And while I was there doing a masters, one of the people, became
06:31
a close friend, Jim Krygier.
06:34
That’s K-r-y-g-i-e-r.
06:36
Jim was a professor here at Oregon State.
06:41
He was on a sabbatical leave at Colorado State, taking his course work
06:47
for a Ph.D., in watersheds, there.
06:52
So, Jim and
06:55
I, spent a lot of time talking to one another.
06:57
We were right across the aisle in the graduate bullpen, our desks were close.
07:02
And then I had to go into the service right after my master’s degree.
07:09
I had a commission.
07:10
What branch of service was that?
07:11
Army.
07:12
Army, okay.
07:17
I suppose I could have delayed for a Ph.D., except for the fact that
07:20
the Berlin Wall went up, President Kennedy mobilized all the reserves,
07:24
and people who were in my kind of position, were immediately called up.
07:28
I was fortunate to finish the master’s degree without having
07:31
to break and go on active duty.
07:35
Jim [Krygier] had said, “Well, let me know when you’re gonna get out of the service,
07:41
and I’ll see if there’s anything at Oregon State I can offer you.” So I did.
07:48
He had gotten started on a program called the Alsea Basin Logging
07:53
and Aquatic Resources Study.
07:56
It was a cooperative study, the first of its kind really, to look at the impact of
08:01
timber harvesting on aquatic resources.
08:05
He
08:07
needed help with that.
08:10
The college’s role was to
08:17
do temperature studies on the hydrology in the interior of the largest watershed.
08:21
The geologic survey had gauging stations at the mouths of these three
08:25
small basins, but we were looking in the patch-cut watershed, at a
08:31
much more, micro-level response.
08:33
Jim
08:35
needed help with that.
08:37
I did the water temperature part and at the same time, did a doctoral dissertation
08:44
on this energy balance approach to predicting stream temperatures.
08:50
That’s really how I came to be here at Oregon State.
08:53
Interestingly, at the end of my Ph.D., Jim was having some serious
09:01
health problems, and they never did I think discover exactly what it was he
09:09
had, but the doctors predicted that it was quite likely to be terminal.
09:16
Fortunately, it was not, but in anticipation of Jim’s declining health,
09:22
the department had asked me if I would stay on the faculty after I finished
09:27
the Ph.D., and continue to lead the research on the watershed study.
09:31
Also, to pick up Jim’s classes and to give him some relief, which I did.
09:38
And sort of the rest, is history.
09:41
That was ‘66?
09:42
‘66. And
09:46
so, I’ve been here ever since.
09:50
Can’t get away.
09:51
Yeah.
09:51
I’m curious, I think you covered this, but maybe a little more detail here.
09:57
What was it exactly that got or drew your attention to the Andrews, when
10:00
you found this great place to study?
10:02
What first attracted you there?
10:04
Well, I’d been there as an employee, I’d been there as a worker.
10:08
And I’d spent a lot of time banging up and down the stream channels
10:11
with Ted Dyrness and Jack Rothacher.
10:13
We’d dug soils pits all over the place, and I remembered this nice, straight,
10:18
open channel that was unshaded.
10:22
This is the time before there was any riparian protection, I mean you
10:25
cut right down to the creek bank, and so it was a very open, open stream.
10:33
There was a gauge at the bottom, so I didn’t have to go out with a
10:36
pygmy meter and measure stream-flow, I mean, it was already being
10:39
recorded on a continuing basis.
10:41
There was just all kinds of attractions there, and it was
10:44
a familiar piece of territory.
10:46
So the existing infrastructure of it, the site, was something you considered,
10:50
the stream gauges and stuff like that.
10:51
Oh yeah, sure.
10:53
Right.
10:53
Do you remember your first impression, when you first started working there with
10:56
Ted doing these soil pits, what was your impression of the place was at that time?
11:01
Oh, I was blown away by it.
11:03
I’d never been in a place like this.
11:06
Coming from Colorado, and all of a sudden finding yourself in
11:09
stands, mixed-conifer, old-growth stands, was quite an experience.
11:14
I remember the first day I went down there was with Jack Rothacher and Ted,
11:18
and they were, it was partly a “show-me trip” [informational tours] , but we were
11:22
also doing some work while we were there.
11:29
We got up to, I think we drove up the road, it
11:36
brings you up on the watershed, above the boundary of Watershed 3.
11:41
We got out of the truck, there were these giant trees, and Jack Rothacher said,
11:49
“Okay, it’s time for a dendrology lesson.
11:51
Tell us what these trees are.” Well, it was a mixture of western red
11:55
cedar, hemlock, and Douglas-fir.
11:58
I looked up to see if there were some distinguishing characteristics, and
12:04
of course, the limbs are up at 125-300 feet, so I looked down on the ground,
12:09
and there was this mixture of cones.
12:11
I couldn’t tell one from the other.
12:13
Because in Colorado,
12:17
most site test specimens we used in dendrology, which had been, good
12:22
grief, I’d taken dendrology almost eight years before, were all in a
12:28
contained little thing you could look at and get your hands on.
12:31
Here, everything was up, and I had no clue as to what the bark
12:35
characteristics were of the trees.
12:38
But it was a great place, and I spent a wonderful summer
12:41
there, going back-and-forth.
12:44
We would live down there [Blue River] in some beat up old trailers.
12:53
It was not what you’d call gracious living.
12:56
It was in a trailer court right across the highway from the ranger station.
13:03
Dick Fredriksen was the resident hydrologist
13:09
on site, and Al Levno worked with him.
13:15
Both of them lived in Blue River, and both, I think on
13:18
the ranger station compound.
13:22
But then we would go up periodically for these special things.
13:27
Do you recall at that time, what your knowledge was of the function of an
13:32
experimental forest, and at this place, definitely, the reputation of the Andrews?
13:35
Had you been around it at all before that?
13:37
Nope.
13:38
All new to
13:41
you?
13:41
Yep.
13:41
Aside from Ted, who you were working with, and had you heard
13:43
of any of the scientists that were working down there at that point?
13:47
Yeah, I heard of Jack Rothacher.
13:49
Okay.
13:51
And I’d read some of the stuff that he’d written.
13:52
But that was pretty much it.
13:56
And Ted, you had met here on campus?
13:59
Well, I showed up to work for Ted.
14:02
Oh, okay.
14:02
So, I kind of showed up over there, and that was the first time.
14:06
So, he introduced you to the whole concept of
14:11
the forest [experimental forest]
14:12
. Yes.
14:12
But the forest [Andrews] was a very different place then.
14:13
They were just beginning to do harvesting experiments.
14:17
I mean, this was back in the infancy.
14:21
There’d been a few harvest units done up there that Roy Silen had put in place,
14:26
and there were these three watersheds that were kind of the start of the experiments,
14:32
and they had just begun to harvest.
14:35
They’d finished the harvest on Watershed 3 while I was there in ‘64, and they
14:41
were finishing up the harvesting on Watershed 1, which was using a crane
14:48
system [Wyssen] that was in place.
14:50
And they were still doing the yarding on that.
14:53
That was [unintelligible]
14:55
. Yeah.
14:55
His operation, yeah.
14:56
Right.
14:56
Besides from the trailers at the Blue River Station [Ranger District] , can
15:00
you remember much about the facilities?
15:02
What else was there?
15:03
The ranger station.
15:04
And Dick Fredriksen may have had some kind of little laboratory facility in
15:09
the ranger station, but it wasn’t much.
15:12
That was pretty much it.
15:14
None of the stuff up there on the forest that’s there now, was there.
15:19
And Jack Rothacher’s living down there at the house.
15:22
Not when I was here.
15:23
He had transferred down here to Corvallis, and I think Fredriksen was probably living
15:28
in the place he was living in, or had been living in, because Dick lived on-site.
15:35
Where did he live, Fredriksen?
15:37
He lived in the compound.
15:38
The compound, okay.
15:39
Yeah.
15:40
How much interaction did you have with Blue River, the people in Blue River?
15:44
Almost none.
15:45
What did you do when you were not working?
15:47
Well, there wasn’t much to do, honestly.
15:50
It was before the dam [Blue River] . The dam was not in place then, and kind
15:57
of the big event of the day was, where we were going to dinner, and we had
16:01
only a couple of places to choose
16:05
from.
16:05
[Laughter] And then, after dinner, there was a lot of conversation and
16:08
you read books, stuff like that.
16:10
And what I did was, I spent a lot of time getting ready for my
16:14
German exam and my French exam.
16:17
Good place to study.
16:19
Yeah, in those days, the Ph.D. required two languages, and I had studied German
16:25
in an Army language school, and so, shortly after I got here, I took the
16:30
German exam, and then immediately shifted to trying to learn French on my own.
16:37
So, I spent a lot of time doing that in the evenings.
16:39
If
16:42
you could,
16:47
what were the results of your research that you were working on when you were
16:50
doing your doctoral research out there?
16:54
Well, I put together a stream temperature prediction model that was energy-
16:59
balance based, and it worked fairly well.
17:03
I also ultimately took that model, because of the predominate importance
17:09
of net solar radiation, and put together a kind of quick and dirty thing that
17:14
managers could use for predicting the impact of opening streams at various
17:20
reach lengths, and temperature changes that would occur within that unit.
17:26
Again, this is before the time of riparian buffer strips [vegetation
17:30
along streams] that were required later.
17:32
This also demonstrated the importance of shade and controlling stream temperature.
17:36
But that was kind of the thrust of the research.
17:41
Were you working with anybody else on that research, or was this something
17:45
that you kind of did on your own?
17:45
No, it was all my own.
17:47
I mean, it was a typical doctoral dissertation.
17:49
You’re kind of given the problem by the major professor and some
17:52
grant money, and you did it.
17:57
Do you recall much interaction among different scientists down
18:01
there when you were working there?
18:02
I guess I’m trying to get a sense of the kind of community that existed there
18:06
among the people working on the forest.
18:07
There was a very close working relationship within the watershed
18:11
group, and Jack Rothacher was a marvelous project leader.
18:17
He and Ted worked very closely together, and also with Dick
18:21
Fredriksen and Al Levno.
18:22
They were a really close-knit team.
18:24
And I, for a short period of the time, became a part of the team, and
18:27
they were great people to work with.
18:29
I thoroughly enjoyed it.
18:31
When you were done working, did you come up here to Corvallis, or did
18:35
you spend almost all your time while you were doing your study down there?
18:37
No, most of the time was here.
18:38
We would go down and live in the trailer periodically.
18:43
You know, we’d be down there for a week at a time, and then come home and what not.
18:49
So it was.
18:51
And then we were at other places.
18:52
We did work on the, as I said, at Tiller [District] on the Coyote Creek
18:59
Experimental [watersheds] , or South Umpqua, I guess it’s called, the
19:02
South Umpqua Experimental Forest.
19:05
And then up at the Bull Run, which is where they have the Fox Creek Watershed.
19:12
The
19:16
close-knit team that you’re talking about on the watershed, these are people
19:19
who were interacting here on campus?
19:21
Or did you see that when you were working down at the Andrews, or both?
19:24
Kind of both.
19:28
The question that has been perplexing me here recently, as I get into my
19:32
research a little bit, is the kind of evolving relationship between
19:35
people in the OSU College of Forestry and the [U.S.] Forest Service.
19:39
How would you describe interaction among those two groups in the early ‘60s?
19:43
What would you talk about there?
19:44
Well, there’s a lot,
19:51
in addition to the interplay between Jim Krygier and Jack Rothacher
20:02
and Ted Dyrness.
20:04
Ted got his Ph.D., as I think you know, under Chet Youngberg.
20:09
There was this interaction between Chet and Ted.
20:10
At
20:18
the time, this building was not in place, and we were up at the
20:23
so-called, “Old Forestry Building.” It’s now called Moreland Hall.
20:28
There were scientists there that worked with our faculty.
20:34
They had some awful lab space down in the basement, almost in
20:38
the furnace room kind of thing.
20:41
[Laughter]
20:41
They had Forest Service scientists?
20:42
Yeah, Forest Service scientists with our people up there.
20:46
Bob Ruth [Forest Service] and Bill Ferrell [OSU] , for example, worked closely
20:49
together, and there may have been some others that were actively involved.
20:55
But it was a small community.
20:56
I mean, the lab here was nowhere near what it is now, of course.
21:01
They had just recently built the new facility, the first story, the little
21:06
low place, the one-story piece of that building [of Forestry Sciences Laboratory
21:11
complex] , just before I had arrived, and so they felt these were great new digs for
21:16
them and people who were in that complex.
21:21
So, the Forest Service people moved over there from the old building first.
21:23
Right.
21:24
My understanding is that it was kind of a phased development of
21:27
that new building over there.
21:28
Yes.
21:28
And they started to kind of open there.
21:33
At what point did faculty here begin to move into that building?
21:37
About, can’t remember if it was 1980 or ’81, but we moved
21:46
the Forest Science Department, almost all of it, up there then.
21:53
We rented the space, and we’ve been there ever since.
21:56
That was ‘81, you said?
21:57
I think it was ‘81.
21:58
‘81, okay.
21:59
Maybe it was 1980.
22:01
I’d have to think about that for a bit, but it was around that time.
22:05
Do you recall the reasons why that move was made at that point?
22:09
No, although I think it was the fact that they may have gone through a budget
22:15
reduction and had space available, or simply that they had added this new
22:21
structure there, they built the other part of it, and simply were unable to fill it.
22:27
Okay.
22:28
That’s when Carl Stoltenberg was dean?
22:30
Right.
22:33
Maybe you could talk a little bit about what your perception
22:34
is of the impact of that move.
22:36
How did that affect
22:37
-- ? Well, it did a number of things.
22:39
It certainly gave us access to some wonderful facilities.
22:43
I think if you compare, we had the Forest Science Department, some here, but mostly
22:50
in the old Forestry Research Lab, which was a building built in the early ‘50s,
22:56
and really not very good laboratory space.
23:02
So putting them over here certainly upgraded the facility quality immensely,
23:09
and it also provided us a host of new colleagues for them to interact with.
23:21
But, we’ve had this ongoing, and maybe you’re gonna get to this in a minute,
23:25
but we’ve had this ongoing tremendous working relationship with the Forest
23:28
Service for a very long period of time.
23:34
The kind of the thing that brought it about, I guess I’d say, accelerated
23:40
that interaction, was the National Science Foundation’s International
23:45
Biological Program, or IBP.
23:51
Once that happened, it provided a very large, new source of money.
23:57
And Jerry Franklin, who was Principle Ecologist in the Forest Service here, and
24:07
Dick Waring, who was a faculty member, now a distinguished professor at OSU,
24:17
really provided the bulk of the leadership for this program.
24:21
University of Washington was also a partner, in what was called the
24:24
Coniferous Forest Biome Program, and they really provided tremendous
24:33
direction for this research.
24:36
And the OSU portion of the research was extremely well done, and they,
24:44
these two guys, pretty irreverent about how they distributed these funds as
24:50
P.Is., and by that I mean, they were very hard-nosed about having scientists
24:57
that were gonna produce quality research, and that may not have meant having
25:04
people that were already on the faculty.
25:07
We had a very different faculty then than now.
25:10
The faculty in the college were a lot less research-oriented, and so what
25:17
Waring and Franklin did, was recruit a bunch of young hot dogs that were
25:24
really go-get-em types, young post-docs.
25:30
The names will be immediately familiar; Fred Swanson and Jim Sedell, Phil Sollins,
25:38
and a host of others of that kind.
25:44
These are people who were really aggressive, good, no-nonsense scientists.
25:51
I mean, they were going to go out and get the job done.
25:53
They were tremendously excited about the opportunity to put together a major
26:01
ecosystem model for the way the coniferous forests of the Western Cascades operated.
26:08
Now at that time, I was a hydrologist on the campus, and I chaired the hydrology
26:13
committee for that initial IBP program.
26:13
And so
26:21
it was a great experience, and kind of a very heady time.
26:28
That did a couple of things.
26:31
It really set the stage for strongly-integrated, interdisciplinary
26:39
systems research, and that became the modus operandi which has continued today.
26:47
People marvel at the way in which scientists on this campus,
26:51
that includes the federal agency scientists, work together.
26:55
Well, it’s a habit.
26:55
It got started when people were young and they were not fighting
26:59
over turf and they were really interested in doing this systems work.
27:07
Franklin and Waring played a very critical role here in helping us collectively
27:15
to work together on a complex issue.
27:18
Very demanding people, they really pushed everybody very, very hard.
27:24
And so at the end of this, the Forest Service took these post-doc
27:30
people, basically, and turned them into Forest Service scientists.
27:34
Okay?
27:35
So the fact that they [laughter] started wearing a green shirt [Forest Service]
27:42
didn’t make a bit of difference, they just kept doing as they were doing,
27:46
and that was interacting with the faculty and sharing facilities and
27:53
writing grants together and continuing the work with the National Science Foundation.
27:59
And of course, the National Science Foundation was ecstatic
28:02
about what these guys were doing, because they were successful.
28:07
I mean, this was a place that the National Science Foundation could
28:11
point to and say, “See, ecosystem research can be done, and it can be
28:14
done successfully.” After IBP ended, the next program which this slid right into,
28:22
was the Long-Term Ecological Research
28:27
[LTER] program, and we haven’t missed a step. I mean, it’s just
28:31
continued to go right along.
28:32
So, I think the IBP program started in something like ‘68 or ‘69, and you
28:39
know, we’ve been at that 20 years.
28:43
Interesting.
28:44
Or 30 years, good God!
28:49
[Laughter]
28:52
It’s an interesting focus when you decided to pick up post-docs
28:56
to do this kind of work.
28:57
Yeah, it created quite a stir.
28:59
There was a lot of friction about that.
29:01
I was going to ask you about that.
29:03
Because some of the older scientists
29:08
sort of assumed this money was going to come out automatically
29:10
to them, but it did not.
29:13
And it did not because of what these guys were asking them to do.
29:16
“We want you to do this kind of work on this piece of the system, we want
29:19
it to be able to tie in backwards and forwards, okay, and we want it by
29:25
whenever.” And a lot of folks were just unable to fit into that kind of a thing.
29:30
Sounds like there’s a certain kind of adaptability to be willing to
29:33
focus, refocus their research or
29:36
-- [Interrupting] -- right, and to really rethink how you do research.
29:38
I mean, you’re not just there doing your thing, you are part of a team and you have
29:43
a very crucial part of that box to fill in, and we’re counting on you to do that.
29:49
And we’re not just counting on you to fill in the box, we’re counting
29:52
on you to fill in the box in a way that ties with the other sides of it.
29:58
Now, let’s see.
29:58
You chaired the hydrology committee for the IBP program, so you were involved with
30:03
the recruitment of some of these people.
30:05
How does that work?
30:06
Yeah, well the people I had on my committee were not post-docs.
30:12
We had a
30:15
young scientist by the name of Dennis Harr, who then, was an assistant
30:21
professor and eventually went to work when Jack Rothacher retired,
30:26
permanently for the Forest Service; again another one of those linkages.
30:32
And we recruited a hydrologist out of, I think University of Nevada-Reno, by
30:37
the name of Gurgy, who was a modeler.
30:43
Well, he did not [laughter] live up to our expectations, let’s just say that.
30:50
I stuck with this program for about three or four years, and then was appointed
30:54
department head in Forest Engineering, and had to give it up, and I think Dennis
30:59
Harr took over the hydrology piece.
31:02
Went by this pretty quickly, and it’s a small point, but I wanted to get
31:05
a glimpse here of what’s going on.
31:07
This guy Gurgy, who didn’t work out, was there any particular reason for that?
31:11
Yeah, he just never was able to successfully put together the
31:15
kind of models that we needed.
31:16
Okay, so the product wasn’t coming in.
31:18
Right.
31:18
Did, did it have anything to do with the kind of group environment there?
31:21
I don’t think so.
31:21
Well, in a sense, he was a long way away,
31:26
physically.
31:27
Okay.
31:27
Yeah, so we’d send him stuff and nothing would ever come back.
31:31
Where was he?
31:31
Nevada.
31:32
Nevada-Reno.
31:32
Okay.
31:33
He never came out?
31:34
No, he did not join us, he stayed where he was.
31:37
He was a professor there.
31:38
Oh, I see.
31:39
Was that unusual?
31:39
Yeah.
31:41
Although
31:44
the other piece of the IBP program for the Coniferous Biome was the
31:48
University of Washington, and Dale Cole [UW] chaired that group.
31:53
And they operated kind of independently, but Waring and Franklin
32:00
would contract with other faculty from other places to help out
32:04
with certain pieces if they had some specific expertise.
32:08
And Dick can tell you about that in a lot more detail than I.
32:12
Yeah, I’ll talk to him.
32:13
Were there any problems with recruiting people to do this, I mean, was this
32:18
something that people wanted to do?
32:18
No, if you had money.
32:20
Yeah.
32:22
[Laughter] That’s one of the marvelous things, money.
32:24
And in terms of where the research had to be done, much of it was done at the
32:30
Andrews, was there any concern about that, or coordination of the work down there?
32:36
No, they did a marvelous job of coordination.
32:40
Dick Waring is a very, very well-organized person, and
32:49
the fact that we were working on a same, a similar site was,
32:52
I think, a great advantage.
32:55
Although there were studies done in other kinds of locations and places,
33:01
for example, some of the lichen work that got done was done out here on
33:06
the research forest of the college.
33:09
Oh, the McDonald.
33:10
Right.
33:12
But, the Andrews was a great location, it got people together, and there was a
33:19
tremendous amount of good communication.
33:21
There would be these meetings on a regular basis, sort of sharing what
33:24
you know and what you’re doing.
33:27
And we were breaking a lot of new ground in those days, particularly in
33:32
the biology areas, learning about the importance of the under, beneath the
33:39
surface of the soil system and all the nutrient cycling and all the importance
33:44
of insects in that role, looking really at the complexity of old-growth
33:51
forests, which people had not examined.
33:55
The
33:58
common knowledge of the time was that these were systems that
34:01
were really kind of stagnant and dying, they weren’t productive.
34:07
But, my gosh!
34:08
There was all kinds of stuff going on in those forests.
34:11
And they did some really incredible work up in the crowns of these things, looking
34:17
at the dynamics of what goes on up there, finding all of a sudden, my gosh, you’ve
34:20
got all sorts of animals up there living.
34:23
It’s not just the spotted owl, it’s the red-footed tree vole and any
34:28
number of other critters up there, and then there’s this lichen system
34:31
up there which is sucking nutrients out of the air and depositing them
34:36
down on the ground as they fall.
34:38
So there was some really
34:43
gee-whiz kind of stuff that came out of that.
34:46
Do you have any perception of what the reaction to this kind of research
34:50
was from the standpoint of forest managers in the industry, for example?
34:55
Well.
34:55
Or the National Forest
34:59
Service?
35:00
Yeah.
35:00
Ultimately, and by ultimately, I mean, probably there was a lot of mystery
35:05
about what was going on up there.
35:08
But the Forest Service in my view, the National Forest System’s piece,
35:14
those guys have been very, very cooperative right from the get-go.
35:19
And there have been a series, we have been very fortunate, particularly
35:24
the last 10 or 15 years, a series of rangers who really put body and
35:33
soul into making that place work.
35:36
Because while it is a PNW Station facility, the ground is managed
35:43
by the National Forest system.
35:47
So you had to have good cooperation with the ranger district and
35:54
Willamette National Forest.
35:55
And that was really one of those models, I believe, of interaction.
36:00
Can you think of any people in particular that would kind of fit that?
36:05
Oh, sure.
36:06
Steve
36:06
-- -- Eubanks?
36:06
Yes.
36:07
Eubanks was a classic,
36:13
personally very interested in what was going on, the current
36:16
ranger, and his successor, wish it would recall who it was.
36:23
Lynn Burditt?
36:24
Lynn Burditt, thank you.
36:26
Hell to get old.
36:29
Lynn is another one who is very professionally interested
36:34
in what’s going on out there.
36:37
Both of those folks, and there probably were others as well, but
36:40
those two in particular, saying “Hey, let’s start seeing if we can apply
36:45
some of this stuff operationally outside of the research forest.”
36:50
Now, Steve came in, I think, in the mid-80s, and Lynn is current.
36:54
Before that, when the IBP was going on from ‘68 to about ‘75, was there
37:00
much of a sense of what was going on?
37:01
You said it was kind of a mystery at that time.
37:02
Well, there wasn’t as much interaction as Lynn and Steve
37:10
did, at least my sense was that was the case.
37:12
Now, this is spoken from afar, and the best information you’re going to
37:17
have about that is Jerry and Dick.
37:21
But I think this has been a place where the Forest Service has really
37:26
been interested, has paid a lot of attention to what’s going on up there,
37:30
has been very helpful in facilitating operational things, like harvest
37:35
and thinning and planting, and road construction and site development.
37:41
I just think they’ve just done a marvelous job.
37:43
Again, a real example of
37:50
agency and university cooperation.
37:55
As you know, probably from experience, you can’t tell the players without a program.
38:03
You go up there on field trips, and the Forest Service scientists
38:06
and the University scientists are interacting, they’re telling this
38:10
part of the story and that part of the story, and we’ve got Art McKee who
38:15
is site manager and an OSU employee.
38:19
The guy who manages programs is Fred Swanson, and Fred’s a Forest Service
38:23
employee, but we’re working off of a National Science Foundation grant
38:26
that comes to the university [OSU]
38:30
. It’s the way it ought to be, not to be restricted by these boundaries.
38:35
I’m just trying to think, in the middle of the IBP research, were there many
38:39
of those kinds of trips and tours taking place that you can recall?
38:45
No, not nearly as many as there have been of late, at least my
38:48
sense is that that wasn’t the case.
38:50
Yeah, right.
38:52
Dick can answer that question better than I can, but I mean, these guys now are
38:56
almost loved to death by people wanting to come up there and see this place.
39:00
You know, this now is after a 30-year track record of a stack of
39:06
publications, and this place being, kind of known as one of the meccas
39:10
of forestry research in the country.
39:14
The
39:16
IBP program was really the beginning of when that started to occur.
39:21
The IBP era is when the place kind of gelled in terms of scientists
39:24
coming together and, and really focusing as an interagency kind of
39:28
- Well, it moved from being a Forest Service experimental forest, in which the
39:34
money, the scientists, were primarily, if not almost exclusively Forest
39:39
Service, to really, a much bigger thing.
39:44
It became a
39:48
regional, then a national, and then kind of an international research facility.
39:54
It really did.
39:56
Up until that time, nobody’d heard of it.
39:58
Not much, you know.
39:59
Well the forest [HJA] , well, people here knew about it, but probably
40:04
not very many places beyond that.
40:09
When I was in school in the ‘50s and early ‘60s,
40:19
the place for a hydrologist to go, the mecca then, was the Coweeta
40:26
Hydrologic Laboratory in North Carolina.
40:28
Okay?
40:31
That was kind of the grand-daddy of them all.
40:34
And there were other experimental forests.
40:35
There was the Fernow Experimental Forest up in the Northeast [West
40:41
Virginia] , but that was kind of it.
40:44
And the Andrews really didn’t become a focal point until after
40:48
that, I think, until after the IBP program really cranked up.
40:51
I mean, that doesn’t mean that there wasn’t good work going on here or that
40:55
it wasn’t important stuff, it was just the visibility that came with that
41:01
IBP program, this bunch of young “hot dogs” doing some really great stuff,
41:08
and just like that, it took off.
41:12
Now, as a member of the faculty in the College of Forestry [OSU]
41:15
, during this IBP period, what was your perception of the purpose of
41:20
the forest, experimental forest at that time, one such as the Andrews?
41:24
And what I’m thinking of here, is comparisons between that and the
41:28
state of the McDonald-Dunn Forest.
41:30
What are the different roles that they play in terms of your program
41:32
here and what you expected of it?
41:34
Then?
41:34
Yeah.
41:36
Well, there wasn’t was much research going on at the McDonald-Dunn Forest then.
41:42
This is a forest that’s really kind of grown up in a 30-year period.
41:47
We got it as a cutover in the ‘30s, and from then to probably the
41:53
early ‘60s, it was trying to get the thing restocked and replanted.
41:58
We had CCC people doing planting up there, and faculty and students would
42:03
go up for what they called Arboretum Day, and cut brush and plant trees.
42:10
From the early ‘60s until probably the early ‘70s,
42:16
maybe the mid ‘70s, the management plan for there was to produce some revenue
42:20
for the college and to clean up the damage from the Columbus Day Storm
42:25
. That’s kind of the management scheme.
42:28
But the trees just continued to grow and we’ve got a remarkable facility there now.
42:34
Whereas down on the Andrews, you had a lot more money.
42:37
I mean, it was a targeted research effort, and you had better money and facilities
42:43
there, coming through the Forest Service, than we ever had coming through the state.
42:49
So, very different.
42:51
The one experimental program that we had that I think, at least in its day,
42:59
was sort of a visionary rival to the Andrews, was the Alsea Basin
43:06
Logging and Aquatic Resources Study.
43:08
Because that was very new, it was an interagency cooperative program,
43:11
it had some money, and allowed us to for the first time, to look at
43:16
interactions between harvesting and water quality and fish.
43:19
The Andrews was looking at harvesting and water quality, but not so much
43:23
the fish part, and particularly not the kind of anadromous fish
43:26
we were dealing with over there.
43:28
Now, was the [U.S.] Geological Survey and Oregon State University?
43:32
It was Forest Service, Geological Survey, Federal Water Pollution
43:39
Control Administration Lab, which was the precursor to the EPA, and Oregon
43:47
Department of Fisheries and Wildlife.
43:49
No, that’s not right.
43:51
It was the Oregon Game Commission.
43:54
That was the precursor.
43:55
We used to have a game commission and a fish commission and they merged into ODF
43:59
& W [Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife], and so, this was before that,
44:01
and this was when the Game Commission which was responsible for sport fisheries.
44:09
At Oregon State University, the program was coordinated by
44:14
Jim Hall, who is now Professor Emeritus in Fisheries and Wildlife.
44:20
And I think Georgia Pacific was an industrial cooperator.
44:27
I think that’s kind of the mix of them.
44:30
I’m trying to get a grip here.
44:33
One of the leading differences with the Andrews, seems to be a lot of private
44:35
land involved in the McDonald-Dunn Forest.
44:37
Is that right?
44:38
Some.
44:38
Two of the three experimental watersheds were Forest Service, the third one
44:42
in which we did the clearcutting and burning, was Georgia Pacific land.
44:46
Okay.
44:47
On a much smaller scale in the Andrews,
44:57
and three watersheds for a very specific purpose and for a relatively short
45:02
time, like a 15-year study period.
45:04
Oh, okay.
45:04
So, it was not ongoing.
45:06
Although Jerry Franklin was able to get the control watershed in the Alsea
45:12
Basin declared a research natural area.
45:16
I’m trying to think when was it that you became dean [OSU-COF]
45:21
here, ’80, or was it the late ‘80s?
45:21
No, 1990.
45:23
Oh, okay.
45:24
Yeah, January 1 of 1990.
45:29
But I’ve been thinking, until that point, you were acting as,
45:35
you were just were on the faculty, right?
45:37
Were you chair of a department?
45:38
Well, let’s see.
45:39
I joined the faculty in ‘66 as an assistant professor.
45:45
In 1973, I was appointed head of the Forest Engineering Department.
45:51
And then in, must have been
45:55
‘86, I became Associate Dean for Research, and then in ‘90, was selected as Dean.
46:08
What I was going to ask here is a little bit difficult, testing your
46:12
current position as dean, looking back on the history of the college
46:16
and how developments at the Andrews have influenced priorities and mission
46:22
at the College of Forestry at OSU.
46:25
What kinds of change do you see resulting from the kinds of work
46:28
that was being done at the Andrews?
46:31
Well, I don’t think it changed our mission at all,
46:41
but I think what it did
46:45
very clearly, is it resulted in
46:52
a lot better science integration in our Forest Science Department,
46:58
in the biology part of what we do.
47:03
It brought us a lot of just tremendous young people into
47:09
the college, with obviously different interests and attitudes.
47:16
But
47:19
it also was the first time our faculty, or a large percentage, had
47:29
worked together on a systems problem.
47:31
Now, we worked on, sort of a general kind of systems problem with the
47:37
Alsea Basin stuff, but it was never put into the context of a model.
47:42
And we worked cooperatively with people from the agencies I
47:46
just mentioned and, and across campus in fisheries and wildlife.
47:52
But the Andrews work, starting with the IBP program, and then
47:56
going to the LTER, really,
48:01
I think helped demonstrate the premium that high quality
48:07
team research can give you.
48:13
And I think that’s been really the best legacy, if I could
48:17
say, from the Andrews effort.
48:20
And then, there’s some great people that came as a result of that, that have been
48:25
working on, basically the soft money that has been generated from that, for years.
48:30
There’s a
48:34
paradox there that we’re looking at in the study, which is the paradox of
48:37
long-term ecological research being funded with soft money, short-term money, and
48:42
some of the strains it causes on people.
48:44
Oh sure, I agree.
48:46
And it is a paradox.
48:49
But it’s unfortunately, the tenor of the time.
48:54
I don’t see any other option because our traditional institutions,
49:02
the funding for those, is continuing to be reduced over time.
49:06
I mean, you can’t count on a decent research budget and increases every year,
49:12
in either a federal or a state budget.
49:15
And so, it has taken that kind of long-term commitment by the National
49:21
Science Foundation, soft money yeah, but I think then, my sense is, and this
49:26
might be totally wrong, but my sense is that that National Science Foundation has
49:34
got a lot at stake in the LTER, and in the Andrews.
49:38
I think they want to continue to invest money in this over time, and I think
49:43
if we quit doing good research, and if we do not provide good stewardship
49:48
of the funds, and we invest in dumb research, they’re going to pull it.
49:54
But my sense is that, as I said a moment ago, this gives the National
50:00
Science Foundation a tremendous example to point to and say, this is what you
50:06
can do with good ecosystems research.
50:11
I just think it’s a glorious example for them, and barring some unforeseen
50:16
catastrophe, I think we’ve got a shot at continuing that program for a long time.
50:22
So, the paradox is not so much a paradox as it’s self-perpetuating.
50:24
Yeah, it’s just in that sense, in my view, it is.
50:30
I think the National Science Foundation would be dumb to cut this kind of money.
50:34
I think they could be held up to tremendous ridicule, so
50:37
long as we’re doing good work.
50:38
I mean, if we quit doing good work, bets are off.
50:42
But it has come to, I think having somebody like the National Science
50:49
Foundation that has resources, their budget just continues to grow for funding
50:54
that kind of stuff, I think they’ve now got the responsibility for doing that.
51:00
It used to be that
51:08
what you used to think were rock solid agency budgets, like the Forest Service
51:12
budget, or like the state budget to support the Forest Research Lab [OSU
51:16
COF] would be able, and should be, the places that provides the funding.
51:20
I mean, we can barely keep the doors open now.
51:23
But, like you said, it does create a problem for some people.
51:28
It makes you very nervous.
51:30
I mean, you can’t count on that money, except from grant-to-grant.
51:37
That’s a very unnerving kind of position to be in.
51:40
And we’ve got some young people, well they’re now middle-aged people, over
51:45
there, who’ve been living off of this kind of grant money for 10 or 15 years,
51:49
and that’s not a good thing to have.
51:51
I just believe we need to be developing some kind of a funding
51:55
base to keep them in a permanent position, but it isn’t coming.
51:59
The state [Oregon] here, at least, is not investing in that, and I don’t see
52:02
the feds doing much of that either.
52:04
Yeah, I’m kind of interested in the [circumstances] at work there, where
52:06
you have people, a lot of stress involved, and the question is, what
52:10
kind of person is, first of all, attracted to that position, and what
52:14
kind of person stays there long-term?
52:17
And some of those people, I guess, eventually move into permanent-funded
52:20
positions, but not all of them, and sort of just hang out.
52:23
I’m trying, this one person,
52:25
the name is escaped me, but there are several examples of those
52:27
leading scientists that just
52:28
-- -- Yeah, Mark Harmon.
52:30
Yeah, that’s the person I’m thinking of, actually.
52:31
Yeah, classic.
52:32
This guy is just absolutely tremendous.
52:36
We haven’t had in our system, new positions we are able to offer under
52:46
something called program improvement, or
52:51
you
52:55
have a retirement and can fill behind that retirement.
53:00
Those are the two ways to do it.
53:02
We have not had a program enhancement since 1987,
53:08
because of the budget situation in the state of Oregon.
53:12
Because we’ve had declining budgets, when we’ve had vacant positions, we
53:17
quite often have not filled behind them,
53:22
simply because we’re catching up on the budget reduction.
53:26
I mean, we used retirements or other vacancies as a means of
53:35
avoiding having to fire someone.
53:38
That’s a hell of a way to manage a program.
53:40
None of us like to do that, but that’s basically the circumstance
53:44
we’ve been in for a decade.
53:48
Do you think that there is relationship between putting that kind of pressure on
53:51
people and the kind of cooperative effort that developed out there at the Andrews?
53:55
No.
53:56
I guess I would never intentionally put that kind of pressure on people.
54:01
This is a circumstance of the time and I regret it a great deal, because these
54:07
folks have futures and they have families, and living from grant to grant is I think
54:17
a very debilitating kind of thing, in terms of an outside source of pressure.
54:24
Fortunately, people like Mark Harmon are such great scientists they can
54:29
almost count, you know [Laughter] , their soft money has become more
54:34
reliable than our hard money, which if you want an anomaly, that’s it.
54:42
Because these guys have done such good research, and have established such
54:45
a reputation, that I think they’re in great position to continue funding and
54:52
increasing the size of their funding base over time, whereas with the normal
54:56
appropriated funds, the so-called hard dollars, we can’t do that.
55:02
If you want anomalies, that’s the big one.
55:05
So the long-term focus works in their favor in that case, because
55:10
the research is structured where, if you buy into the beginning
55:13
with a grant, there’s a reasonable expectation you’re going to have to
55:15
continue funding that in the future.
55:18
Yeah, well, there is some of that to be sure.
55:20
But particularly again, where you’re doing great work as they are, the
55:25
agency loves to, that’s the place and is a slam dunk for their investment.
55:30
And you can give money to Mark Harmon, and you know that money is gonna get you
55:34
something in the end, and something good.
55:37
And so, the agencies are looking for people like that, I’m just sure they
55:40
are to make those kinds of investments.
55:43
But that doesn’t take the pressure off of Mark.
55:45
It means he’s living, you know, kind of on the edge, wondering about the next grant.
55:51
You can’t help but worry about that stuff.
55:54
Kind of a critical element here as you pointed out with the IBP, a big chunk
55:58
of funding coming in from a nucleus of activity at the Andrews, from regular
56:04
faculty and then post-docs, and that kind of creates a nucleus for moving forward.
56:10
But then, if understood you right, most of those people who are brought
56:13
in, post-docs, became permanent appointees in the forest [Andrews]
56:18
or some central figures anyway.
56:19
Yeah, that’s right.
56:21
That did happen, which is very unusual.
56:23
So, the soft money was a stimulus, but then there was
56:25
this hard money to fall back on.
56:27
And it’s that later period when the LTER is formulated, in the long-term
56:32
-- [Interrupting] -- Right, and there was an increasing program in those times.
56:35
Okay.
56:36
That was the other kind.
56:37
They had some hard, appropriated funds in order to pick up those positions.
56:42
Where they would not, they would just wave them good-bye.
56:44
So, the current situation, from ‘87 on, is very different from that earlier
56:47
period, I guess is what I’m getting at.
56:48
Yes, exactly right.
56:50
It certainly is, because in
56:54
the early ‘80s and the mid ‘80s, there were some program expansions
56:57
in federal agencies going on.
57:00
So that, and the PNW Station, and I don’t know this to be the case, but
57:06
my sense is that the PNW Station was growing at a more rapid rate than
57:10
some of the other stations were, in part because of the issues out here.
57:15
This place has been the cauldron for forest policies, federal forest
57:19
policies, particularly for 20 years.
57:22
Yeah, that’s another issue I wanted to get into here, and move along here.
57:26
I don’t know what your time frame is like, we’re about 2/3 of the way
57:30
through, and then I’ll get out of here.
57:32
I wanted to talk a little bit about Jerry Franklin’s move into
57:35
leadership and then, eventually, out to the University of Washington.
57:38
As I understand if I’m recalling this right, he left somewhere around ‘86, about
57:41
the same time that you were coming in as Assistant Dean of Research, is that right?
57:46
Right.
57:48
Can you recall what was going on there?
57:51
No, I was never really privy to that.
57:54
Jerry, by ‘86,
57:58
had a
58:01
long time in the Forest Service, it may have been close to 30 years,
58:06
and I think he was looking for something else to do.
58:08
Jerry’s the best guy to talk to about that.
58:11
We did not have a position here for him, they did at University of
58:15
Washington, and so he made the move.
58:17
But the particulars of that, I was not privy to.
58:21
Okay.
58:21
I was curious if you had a reaction to that because he was so central
58:24
to building up this, this secure element, and then in the ‘80s
58:28
-- [Interrupting] -- But it’s been really interesting.
58:31
Jerry
58:33
has stayed connected very well down here.
58:39
In fact, he was here this week.
58:43
I gave a lecture, in fact, the opening lecture for this IUFRO, or
58:47
Uneven Aged Management Workshop.
58:51
So, there’s been a lot of on-going connection with him.
58:55
That hasn’t stopped.
58:57
Yeah, that, he was also instrumental in putting together the
59:00
-- -- He was also instrumental in putting up a joint administration agreement
59:06
between the
59:09
Forest Service and Oregon State University at the Andrews when Art McKee came in.
59:14
Yeah, right.
59:15
And I don’t know, this was drafted in what, 1978?
59:21
I think that is when that was.
59:22
Yeah, I guess I don’t know the date on that, but I’m sure he had an
59:26
important role to play in all that.
59:28
He did some very creative things.
59:31
There were those he helped put in place, a network of research natural areas
59:37
around the state, a tremendous legacy.
59:40
How would you characterize, looking at that joint agreement between the
59:46
university [OSU] and the Forest Service, it is very unusual you have the Forest
59:49
Service property with a non-site director as an employee at the university.
59:54
What are some of the problems associated with that, and how are they overcome?
59:57
Well, I guess
1:00:04
you’re going to have to talk to people that are more intimately involved in
1:00:08
the day-to-day operation about that, if you want sort of the nitty-gritty of how
1:00:14
those things occur, and are administered.
1:00:19
I’ve talked to Art about it, but I’m just curious from your standpoint.
1:00:21
From my standpoint?
1:00:22
Let me give you sort of the big picture standpoint.
1:00:24
The big picture standpoint is, I think this is a tremendous example of
1:00:28
how we ought to be working together across organizational boundaries.
1:00:33
Talk
1:00:36
about examples of governmental efficiency, this is one.
1:00:41
We all [OSU] , and these guys, the other neat thing about the people that
1:00:46
have been involved in this program, is that they don’t like administration.
1:00:52
Okay?
1:00:54
That’s my impression, and so they do everything they can to avoid having to
1:00:58
be bound up in administrative hoopla, and they get on with the science.
1:01:05
And the Forest Service and the university [OSU] have given them
1:01:08
a lot of freedom to do that.
1:01:11
So, that’s what they do.
1:01:13
They don’t argue about boxes on an organizational chart, they don’t
1:01:18
worry about reporting lines, they don’t worry about all these other
1:01:21
kinds of oft-times tenacious, and contentious administrative issues.
1:01:27
They just do the work, and they’re committed to doing that.
1:01:31
So
1:01:33
they avoid a lot of the administrative garbage that plagues bureaucracies
1:01:39
when they’re trying to interact.
1:01:41
They don’t mess with that.
1:01:42
I give them a great deal of credit for that style of operation.
1:01:46
And of course, we have tried to minimize the number of hurdles and administrative
1:01:54
hoopla things they’ve got to go through.
1:01:58
So I think it’s great.
1:01:59
I think that ought to be the model of how organizations like ours interact.
1:02:04
But of course, there’s the question of how they manage to do that.
1:02:07
If you look at where they came from, you know, organizations
1:02:11
that are fairly bureaucratic, the university and the Forest Service,
1:02:16
many of those people can’t do that in those organizations.
1:02:18
Yeah, true.
1:02:18
But I think you had people on both ends of the administrative spectrum willing to
1:02:22
allow this to happen, then you had Jerry Franklin who had a lot of credibility in
1:02:29
the Forest Service, people had tremendous respect for him, and old ‘Jer just
1:02:35
went out there and did it [laughter], and talked these folks into it.
1:02:39
And if you had a different personality involved, it may never have happened.
1:02:46
But he had the tenacity and
1:02:52
the organizational respect necessary to pull that off, and he did it.
1:02:58
And by organizational respect, you mean both within and
1:03:01
outside of the organizations?
1:03:01
Yeah, but mostly there [Forest Service] , because that’s their
1:03:04
facility and the federal government.
1:03:07
You know, universities are, for all you think about organizational bureaucracy,
1:03:13
we’re a heck of a lot less bureaucratic in many ways, particularly when it comes to
1:03:17
property things and interactive kinds of things, than a federal agency tends to be.
1:03:24
So this was a real coup that Jerry could have pulled this off, and
1:03:27
he did it within the organization.
1:03:28
Yeah, Jerry and Art have both pointed out that if they had tried to sit
1:03:33
down and codify what they were doing, they probably couldn’t have done it.
1:03:36
It was a fact that, like you say, they were willing to
1:03:41
go out and do this.
1:03:41
What you’re saying is, it’s the kind of person, a certain kind of panache
1:03:45
that you have to have, to carry it off.
1:03:45
That’s right, exactly.
1:03:46
Panache is the right word.
1:03:49
Well
1:03:50
-- -- Brass is another word [Laughter].
1:03:53
Well,
1:03:55
also as you pointed out, the critical point is that people at both agencies,
1:04:00
or all the agencies involved including the forest [HJA] , need to be willing
1:04:04
to let them make that move, so I want to ask you in your working with PNW
1:04:10
Station, who are some of the people up there who have had some of that kind of
1:04:14
characteristic that you can take off?
1:04:18
You mean administratively?
1:04:19
Yeah, administratively.
1:04:21
We’ve had a great series of station directors up there [PNW Station] . While
1:04:25
all this stuff was going on, you had people like Bob Buckman, Bob Tarrant,
1:04:33
Bob Ethington, the three Bobs, and Charlie Philpot.
1:04:41
And Tom Mills now.
1:04:42
We find him a great guy to work with, but he kind of came after all
1:04:47
this stuff has already occurred, but these guys were all in there, sort of
1:04:56
fueling the flame, if you will.
1:04:59
And they were the kinds of people at that end that were willing to
1:05:03
allow these kinds of arrangements to go forward, and applauded them.
1:05:08
All three of the Bobs and Charlie, did that in great style.
1:05:13
They were, they were just super to have.
1:05:15
So that’s, that’s the 30 years.
1:05:17
Yeah, so in other words, right at the top, it’s the station director
1:05:20
level that was really critical there.
1:05:21
Yeah, you bet.
1:05:22
Okay.
1:05:25
In terms of your role in relation to that, being here [OSU] , who have you
1:05:27
been closely involved with at the station?
1:05:33
Well, I guess my role and interactions are primarily with
1:05:38
the director and their staff.
1:05:40
Although I interact a lot with the guys here, just because they’re
1:05:44
doing some interesting stuff and they’re fun to interact with.
1:05:48
Fred [Swanson] and Jim Sedell;
1:05:52
I have had not that much contact with Herman Gucinski, but Logan Norris has.
1:06:00
Almost a day-to-day kind of thing.
1:06:02
But my interaction has been primarily with the station directors,
1:06:06
Charlie Philpot and now Tom [Mills]
1:06:10
. Has the success of this program affected the kinds of faculty that
1:06:13
you go out and try and recruit for the university program here?
1:06:18
Oh, I’m sure it does.
1:06:21
Most of the work is concentrated in forest science, okay.
1:06:27
And because of that, that is kind of our “forest biology” department.
1:06:33
I think clearly it has.
1:06:35
As I mentioned to
1:06:38
you, we have not
1:06:41
filled any new positions for a long time, given our situation.
1:06:47
But the last one we did, the one I told you about, in 1987, we had a program
1:06:51
enhancement and used that money in long-term productivity and for Phil
1:06:55
Sollins, again one of the people that was on soft money working on the Andrews, who
1:06:59
was moved into the permanent position.
1:07:03
So I think if you talk to Logan [Norris] , and I suspect you will, he’ll tell you
1:07:09
that you need people that are going to be able to work together, and can work
1:07:13
in a sort of a systems environment,
1:07:17
and that are willing to really
1:07:24
be able to function and communicate in a very high energy team.
1:07:31
Can you think of any examples of people who’ve started out in that direction
1:07:35
and somehow it didn’t quite pan out?
1:07:40
I’m sure there have been, but none come to mind immediately.
1:07:46
Let’s
1:07:50
back up a minute here.
1:07:53
I wanted to also get a handle here on your level of interaction, as dean here,
1:07:58
with forest managers in the Willamette National Forest and industrial leaders
1:08:04
who work with the Willamette National Forest, and how this initiative on
1:08:07
the Andrews affects that relationship.
1:08:09
I don’t think it does.
1:08:13
We’ve always had a lot of interaction with the Willamette Forest supervisors;
1:08:18
Mike Kerrick, and now Darryl Kenops, who makes a great point of
1:08:26
stopping in from time-to-time, and I see him at professional meetings,
1:08:29
he’s very active as is Mike, in
1:08:34
the Society of American Foresters.
1:08:36
So there’s a lot of that kind of interaction with Darryl.
1:08:40
Darryl works hard to keep us up-to-date on what’s going on the Willamette,
1:08:46
which is a place of great contention.
1:08:50
But I don’t think it’s affected our working relationships, other than, it’s
1:08:55
a common thing, an interest that we have.
1:09:00
The forest supervisors are interested in what’s going on at the Andrews,
1:09:06
as I am, and it’s a common topic of conversation when we get together.
1:09:14
I guess what I’m thinking of is the implications of this kind of research for
1:09:18
issues like the spotted owl controversy, and the impact it might have on the
1:09:23
university’s relationship with its alumni and owners and other things.
1:09:27
No, I don’t think so.
1:09:28
There, you know,
1:09:32
this doesn’t mean that the results or the applications of
1:09:35
results haven’t been contentious.
1:09:36
They have been, and there’s been a lot of interaction about that.
1:09:43
But I think it’s provided, a good opportunity for a lot of dialogue.
1:09:50
Now some of that dialogue is very heated, mind you, but so
1:09:53
far, the dialogue has been civil.
1:09:56
And we’ve had people raising questions about some research results, and I think
1:10:03
that’s good; that’s what science is about.
1:10:05
I mean, if we were all sort of sitting back with our hands folded
1:10:10
demurely, I think we wouldn’t be doing our job as scientists.
1:10:13
Can you give us an example of some people who have raised those kinds of questions?
1:10:16
Yeah.
1:10:19
The issue of Jerry Franklin,
1:10:26
you may know, well, maybe you don’t.
1:10:31
He was taking the research results off the Andrews, and was and has continued to do
1:10:38
so, sort of extrapolate them to what he thinks this means in terms of management.
1:10:44
There was a different point-of-view by one of our department heads, Bill
1:10:48
Atkinson, who is now retired from
1:10:53
Forest Engineering.
1:10:54
Bill was not an engineer, but he was a silviculturist, and he was raising
1:10:58
some real concerns about if we are we ready to go from the stand and small
1:11:06
basin studies, to the landscape level.
1:11:10
And these were some very heated debates.
1:11:15
But I think legitimate ones, in terms of saying, well, are we ready to do
1:11:18
this at the landscape level, kind of carte blanche, by the agency, before
1:11:23
we’d begun to make the next step or the next investment in research that
1:11:28
would go from the stand level and plot level, to a much broader scale.
1:11:35
So yeah, there’ve been those kinds of debates and discussions.
1:11:38
We’ve got one right now going on about the impact of timber harvesting on floods.
1:11:46
Gordon Reeves [Gordon Grant, actually] and
1:11:52
Julia Jones wrote a paper in which they hypothesize or contend
1:11:57
that timber harvesting and road construction increases floods.
1:12:01
Now our hydrologists look at the same data and say your data doesn’t
1:12:05
show that, in fact, it shows just the opposite of what you contend.
1:12:09
And so there is a debate scientifically about what this
1:12:13
same set of information means.
1:12:14
Well, that is great, I think that’s super.
1:12:17
So long as that debate is done civilly and professionally, and this
1:12:23
is what we really ought to be about.
1:12:25
Can you think of any examples of that kind of a debate broke open in terms of
1:12:29
people involved with the Andrews and then led to some kind of a re-synthesis, or
1:12:34
-- ? -- A what?
1:12:35
A reevaluation or a synthesis that kind of grew out of that dispute, in other words?
1:12:47
Well, I think this hydrology one that’s going on right now
1:12:50
is going to cause there to be a
1:12:54
reevaluation.
1:12:54
There’s been some other hydrological questions, giving you, as the hydrologist,
1:12:58
giving you some hydrology link.
1:13:00
Dennis Harr looked at some issues about
1:13:07
the impact of harvesting on flood flows from rain-on-snow events
1:13:13
in the transient snow zone.
1:13:15
Dennis
1:13:18
raised some questions; does timber harvesting, or does it not, influence
1:13:23
the size of the peak flows from those
1:13:26
events?
1:13:27
In my view, this work was never really able to demonstrate that one way or
1:13:31
the other, but again, our hydrologist looked at the same information and said,
1:13:41
we don’t see that being able to be defined, or definitively proven.
1:13:47
And I think people have relooked at that as, at least saying well,
1:13:52
do we know or don’t we know, and the answer is probably not.
1:13:55
So there are those, and I suspect there are some of those going on,
1:13:59
biologically as well, but I’m not attuned enough at that to tell you.
1:14:03
[Nicole Duncum begins Transcribing from this point on the tape; also seems to
1:14:03
be break in recording/transcript, making subjects and commentary discontinuous].
1:14:03
I was curious, things like large woody debris.
1:14:06
Oh, the large woody debris thing.
1:14:08
Absolutely!
1:14:14
I misunderstood the question.
1:14:17
A lot of the Andrews work has caused people to look at things differently.
1:14:21
I thought you were asking if there were scientific issues.
1:14:27
Well, that too.
1:14:28
I gave you a couple of examples of those, but the idea of looking
1:14:32
at the world in a different way,
1:14:38
a host of things have come out of the Andrews as a result of that.
1:14:41
The whole idea of large wood in streams first, then large wood terrestrially
1:14:50
on the land, the idea of legacy stuff.
1:14:53
The whole idea of wildlife leave trees or legacy trees; that was a whole
1:15:02
shift in the way people were looking at these issues, and the biggest one
1:15:06
is to elevate the thinking about the forest in terms of a landscape scale.
1:15:15
Because our focus in this country traditionally was on stands.
1:15:23
Now, all of a sudden these guys down there started raising these questions
1:15:26
about landscape-scale phenomenon.
1:15:28
And
1:15:32
that has changed really the way a lot of people have looked at the forest now.
1:15:38
All of a sudden ecosystem management is the buzz word of choice but what
1:15:42
ecosystem management means is we’re going to look at things in a much
1:15:46
broader context, because water and wildlife, they don’t operate as stands,
1:15:55
they operate in a much bigger system.
1:15:58
Now, I think this is one of those things that this has been ultimately the thing
1:16:02
that has gotten people to focus on.
1:16:08
I’m trying to remember talking to you, you talking about taking some industry
1:16:16
leaders up into the Andrews on a tour and showing the large woody debris.
1:16:21
I think it was Stub Stewart
1:16:24
- Yeah, it was Educator’s Day.
1:16:25
Remember the trip?
1:16:26
Yeah, were you there?
1:16:27
Yeah, yeah.
1:16:28
Parts of that were part a revelation or quite a break-through.
1:16:32
Well, there were a number of those.
1:16:33
You know, the issue of large woody debris in streams, was
1:16:40
an interesting one as well.
1:16:45
Back in the 70’s,
1:16:48
the fisheries people, particularly in the coast, were paranoid about
1:16:55
fish blockage and blocking the migration streams, and there were some
1:17:02
hellacious log jams over there that gave them pause for that.
1:17:07
But as often happens in bureaucracies, they made this kind of one-size-fits-all
1:17:13
prescription, and said, “Okay, let’s get all that wood out of the creek
1:17:16
so the salmon and steelhead can run up the rivers,” without thinking
1:17:19
very much in a systems way again, about what this stuff was doing.
1:17:24
So we had people doing bits and pieces of that a lot on the Andrews, by our
1:17:30
faculty and by the Forest Service.
1:17:34
And these pushy post-docs like Sedell and Swanson, and over coffee one time,
1:17:45
we got to kind of comparing notes about, kind of a little brown-bagger
1:17:49
thing, what are we finding out from all this work we’re doing?
1:17:53
Well, the overwhelming message was this stuff is critically
1:17:57
important to the health of streams and habitat for fish and wildlife.
1:18:01
So, we said, “What are we going to do about it.” Well, I volunteered
1:18:04
to host, and this was when I was department head for Forest Engineering.
1:18:07
I volunteered to host a workshop on woody debris in streams.
1:18:14
And these guys did all the work, all I did was get up and introduce all the people.
1:18:18
We imported some experts from afar, guys by the names of
1:18:23
Ken Cummins and Robin Vannote.
1:18:26
They were aquatic ecologists of the first order, and not only that, they
1:18:31
had an able to talk to lay people about what they were doing in their science.
1:18:39
Where were they from?
1:18:41
I don’t know.
1:18:46
Both of them were from the East, and I can’t remember where Cummins
1:18:50
is from, well, I can’t remember where either one of them are from.
1:18:55
But they came because Jim Sedell knew them, and we
1:19:01
hosted this marvelous workshop.
1:19:04
We called it “logging debris in streams,” and that was kind of a macro-rebellion
1:19:08
because what we were going to tell these folks this material in the
1:19:12
streams is good stuff, leave it there.
1:19:14
Don’t jerk all this stuff out because the fisheries guys were requiring the
1:19:18
loggers not only to pull the stuff that fell in the creeks and pull it out,
1:19:21
they were requiring that while you were down there, hand clean all the debris
1:19:25
that’s in the stream and get it out.
1:19:28
So, these guys were spending enormous amounts of money and energy pulling out
1:19:32
old logs and yarding them up on the banks.
1:19:34
So you “whistle clean” these streams, and you went from a pool-riffle
1:19:37
system to a riffle system.
1:19:40
Well, it was very contentious, and the fisheries guys were enraged.
1:19:45
Then
1:19:48
over time, the evidence, the preponderance of evidence and good scientific work
1:19:54
by all these people, got people to finally rethink this whole idea,
1:20:00
and the same thing is happening about the wood on the landscape.
1:20:05
The old wood there and implications of nutrient additions, the idea of habitat
1:20:13
for a lot of critters, just on and on.
1:20:18
So those things were again very important about getting people to think differently.
1:20:24
Can you think of any examples of people who started out being
1:20:29
resistant and then - [changed]
1:20:33
? Yeah!
1:20:34
In fact, I won’t share the name with you, but at that meeting, the
1:20:40
workshop we had, we had a guy who was at that time, he worked for the Fish
1:20:44
Commission, and these were the people responsible for the commercial fisheries.
1:20:49
And they crossed over with the [Oregon] Game Commission on salmon.
1:20:52
But this guy came up to me, shook his fist in my face, and cursed me for having
1:21:03
just ruined 20 years of his work, and I said, you may want to think
1:21:10
about whether during those 20 years you were doing the right thing.
1:21:13
I thought he was going to hit me, I really did.
1:21:16
He then left the Fish Commission and
1:21:25
as a fisheries biologist, and joined the Forest Service on one of our
1:21:29
large national forests, and I saw a notification in the paper that he had
1:21:34
received an award for his fish habitat restoration work, particularly for the
1:21:42
role he had played in bringing more large woody debris back into the channels.
1:21:48
I saw that and it made my day, because this guy, had made a 180, and he’d been
1:21:57
recognized for how well he did this.
1:21:59
Yeah, that’s something I’ve run across in the course of this research.
1:22:05
I was also looking at Alaska a couple of years ago and people had been doing
1:22:11
research believing that what they were doing was right, and then there were major
1:22:15
paradigm shifts, and suddenly they found people questioning and challenging them,
1:22:23
and they took it very personally.
1:22:24
Yeah, and I think we kind of get past that, and it seems to me
1:22:32
that this is why it is so important when we put science out for public view;
1:22:40
that shows willingness by professionals to take those kinds of challenges, and
1:22:44
take them not as a personal affront.
1:22:47
That’s hard to do when you put body and soul into this.
1:22:50
You collected data through thick and thin, you’ve written this
1:22:55
down, and signed your name to it.
1:22:58
It’s you.
1:23:00
But to be able to step back and take challenges in a professionally objective
1:23:06
way, we don’t do a good enough job, in my view, of teaching our young
1:23:09
scientists about the importance of scientific debate and how to engage in
1:23:15
that in a way that is professional and is civil and is positively constructive.
1:23:23
And
1:23:26
I just think, when we take it personally, I think we’ve missed the point.
1:23:32
And I think we need you to know if your research will survive rigorous challenges,
1:23:40
which can strengthen the conclusions.
1:23:45
I learned that in “Logic in the Scientific Method” [class] as a student
1:23:48
in Colorado State. So I think we don’t teach our students to do that very well,
1:23:59
which is part of the British system.
1:24:02
The idea of British debate; it’s scathing as they get up
1:24:07
and wail away at one another.
1:24:10
It’s kind of like lawyers debating in a court case, and once that’s done
1:24:15
they walk out of the court room and can go have a beer with one another.
1:24:18
We ought to be able to do the same, mind you.
1:24:20
Is there a public relations component also in what the Andrew’s group has been
1:24:23
able to do has made them successful?
1:24:27
Yeah,
1:24:30
they have.
1:24:32
There’s always a danger in the public relations point-of-view
1:24:36
that sometimes you can release information before it is really ready.
1:24:41
But the good thing that they have done there I think, has been to really
1:24:47
share their science with a huge number of people, particularly managers.
1:24:52
Okay, it’s this idea that you talked about a minute ago.
1:24:55
You take people from the forest industry, and you show them the importance
1:25:00
of what you are doing to maintain the productivity of their sites.
1:25:05
I mean that’s a powerful message.
1:25:07
These guys, contrary to popular opinion, are not
1:25:11
the rape, pillage, burn, cut-up and get-out folks.
1:25:14
They are in the business for a lifetime, for generations, and
1:25:19
they want to maintain the viability and productivity of that land.
1:25:23
So, the Andrews has been a place where they’ve talked
1:25:25
about those kinds of things.
1:25:27
They’ve also excited a lot of lay people about that, and have done a marvelous job
1:25:33
of bringing in students from NSF-sponsored programs, many of them minority students,
1:25:40
who have gotten pumped up about science.
1:25:44
They’ve done a bunch of those kind of ancillary things that
1:25:47
have been really important, and done a great job politically.
1:25:53
I was on a trip in which we went walking through
1:25:58
the Andrews with Senator Hatfield and saw our first spotted owl,
1:26:03
his first too, on that trip.
1:26:07
The Senator, Congressman AuCoin and others that have been supportive of the program,
1:26:13
have really gotten pumped up about this.
1:26:15
And in part they’ve been pumped up because of the partnership
1:26:19
with the National Forest system.
1:26:20
I mean, it’s not just an isolated research project on those trips,
1:26:24
Lynn Burditt or Steve Eubanks
1:26:28
applying science on the rest of
1:26:35
his or her district.
1:26:36
And that makes a huge impression, because people like Hatfield want to see the
1:26:45
kinds of research investments that are being made to payoff in terms of actual
1:26:51
practice, and programs like the Andrews is a classic example of where that occurs.
1:26:58
Just to divulge on this trip with Hatfield.
1:27:01
Who was, aside from yourself, who were the scientists who were on the trip?
1:27:03
Oh, just the whole “hee-haw” gang.
1:27:06
I mean
1:27:08
Art McKee, Fred Swanson, and Mark Harmon.
1:27:13
We were in Harmon’s long-term log decay study when the owl joined us,
1:27:22
so it was one of the Senator’s natural resource assistants,
1:27:27
who there with, probably 10 or 15 people total; two van loads.
1:27:37
A good example of the cooperative element is that you always keep
1:27:44
walking the forest together.
1:27:46
Hatfield, as I recall, and AuCoin were instrumental in bringing in
1:27:50
the funding for the facilities.
1:27:51
Oh, yes, right.
1:27:53
They were both in appropriations and
1:28:01
AuCoin really noticed these guys were living out of these rummy trailers.
1:28:06
I mean, they had all these third-hand trailers up there on the present site,
1:28:11
and they took him up and showed him that.
1:28:13
I don’t know whether he or Swanson was the one that coined the term
1:28:17
“ghetto in the meadow,” but he was very impressed about the work they’ve done,
1:28:23
and saw the need for new facilities.
1:28:25
And so that’s what brought them the marvelous campus up
1:28:28
there with the new buildings.
1:28:32
Oregon State University has some mandate to extension work, and I guess one
1:28:38
element of that would be to bring home the information to local communities.
1:28:43
I was just curious if there was anything like that with the
1:28:45
Andrews that you are aware of.
1:28:47
Well, they’ve got this Cascade Center [for Ecosystem Management] , for learning.
1:28:54
I can’t remember the name of it, but they have taken it upon themselves
1:28:58
to do a lot more educational stuff through the Andrews with the scientists
1:29:01
they’ve got up there, and I think those folks are committed to that.
1:29:08
I just am amazed at the number of visitors they have up there, and that
1:29:12
come up there on a regular basis.
1:29:15
Art and Fred can tell you in detail how many they get, but it’s a huge number of
1:29:23
people that come through there, and it happens because these guys are committed
1:29:27
to telling the story about what they find.
1:29:31
It’s just not we’re going to write a bunch of scientific papers and
1:29:34
go to AAAS and Ecological Society of America [ESA] meetings, give
1:29:39
our papers, and that’s that.
1:29:41
These guys are interested in sharing the information they’ve
1:29:45
got with a whole host of folks.
1:29:48
I gather from what you said earlier at different times and different
1:29:51
ways, that you see this as a model for the way things ought to be done.
1:29:55
I guess the million-dollar question is, “Is it a viable possibility that could
1:30:01
become a model on a broader scale, or as you said, there are unique circumstances
1:30:06
that led to this at the Andrews.”
1:30:07
Yes, there are.
1:30:09
The Andrews is a kind of a facility-focused activity.
1:30:14
I mean, it is far greater and far broader, don’t get me wrong, as not everything
1:30:18
they do is within the boundaries of the Andrews Experimental Forest.
1:30:23
But this is a very-focused program and the Andrews plays a central role in the
1:30:30
long-term funding pattern that has come.
1:30:36
You asked a minute ago about how this program had influenced our thinking
1:30:43
about how to do research, and I say it is a clear example of the importance
1:30:52
of integrated, interdisciplinary research, which has produced a
1:30:57
big payoff as a result of that.
1:31:00
It’s the “whole is bigger than the sum of the parts” kind of thing.
1:31:07
We have subsequently had two other integrated programs that have not been
1:31:13
as site-focused as the Andrews, but nonetheless played off of this idea.
1:31:19
We have some of the same characters involved in doing research in a program in
1:31:26
southwest Oregon on reforestation called the “FIR” program [Forestry Intensive
1:31:30
Research] . A lot of these same people now have this same teamwork mentality going
1:31:36
to work on the system of reforestation in a harsh site in the kind of topography
1:31:42
found in southwest Oregon. And currently, a program on the coast called COPE, the
1:31:48
“Coastal Oregon Productivity Enhancement” program, plays off the same idea of
1:31:53
integrated, interdisciplinary research.
1:31:57
Again, great stuff coming out of that program, and a lot of the same
1:32:01
characters involved on the Andrews are involved in these two programs as well.
1:32:05
So what you are saying is that the snow ball effect is picking up?
1:32:07
Yeah, it is, and it is a sort of a mental construct about how you
1:32:14
can do research most effectively.
1:32:17
Once that mental construct begins to sink in, it will be more viable.
1:32:21
It becomes a habit, then it’s the way we do business.
1:32:26
So, do you see that as having potentially the power to change
1:32:31
the mind-set of the Forest Service, for example, and surrounding areas
1:32:39
that’s probably beyond the scope of the university?
1:32:40
Well, yeah it is.
1:32:41
But I think very clearly
1:32:45
I see it is as a wonderful example, for whomever, Forest Service,
1:32:50
university, you name it, as a way of doing successful research, and
1:33:00
here is a living example of something we often talk about only theoretically.
1:33:07
Well, to bring it back a little closer to home here,
1:33:12
in talking with Jerry Franklin, who obviously had some personal reasons
1:33:16
for leaving Oregon State University as well as professional ones, he
1:33:21
had a little bit of a falling out I think with Carl Stoltenberg, who as I
1:33:25
understand, you were fairly close to.
1:33:28
I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit, just for context
1:33:31
here, really some of the ways in which you would see your vision
1:33:35
as dean here, either following his footsteps or marking out new territory.
1:33:40
What are some your similarities and differences with him in
1:33:43
terms of priorities and goals?
1:33:49
And again, I don’t know the context of the Jerry Franklin-Carl
1:33:53
Stoltenberg interaction, and that’s not one that I care to know about.
1:33:58
I mean those are between two people.
1:34:02
But Carl
1:34:05
was a great dean.
1:34:06
He was dean here for 22 years, and in that time,
1:34:16
he really saw the explosion of science in this college
1:34:25
go on.
1:34:26
And
1:34:29
he was very much a statesman.
1:34:32
This is the guy who served as chairman of the Oregon State Board of Forestry
1:34:35
longer than anybody before or since, who was president of the Society of
1:34:41
American Foresters, and who was probably the most respected Dean on the campus.
1:34:48
Just a tremendous individual.
1:34:51
He was a
1:34:57
great role model in many ways for me because he appointed me as
1:35:02
department head over the objection of a lot of folks, because I was a
1:35:07
hydrologist taking over the reigns of what had been at one time called
1:35:11
the “logging engineering” department.
1:35:15
He took a real risk, took a lot of heat, so he was a guy that would
1:35:21
stick by his principles, and had a tremendous amount of personal integrity.
1:35:27
I also appreciated the style of management that he had in which he pretty much
1:35:39
let the department heads run their departments.
1:35:43
He was not a micromanager and I surely hope I am not, but he was a
1:35:49
guy that would let you take the bit in your teeth and run with it, and as a
1:35:56
result of that, a host of folks did.
1:35:58
Dick Waring did, but he didn’t micromanage Dick with the IBP stuff,
1:36:05
didn’t micromanage me as a department head, and I think that was a great thing.
1:36:10
We’ve had to deal with different sets of problems and
1:36:18
the problems I have faced budget-wise were different than ones than the ones he faced
1:36:24
because the State of Oregon has continued to disinvest in higher education.
1:36:29
How so?
1:36:33
We all have a different kind of personal style in the way we do stuff, but again,
1:36:39
I try not to micromanage the departments.
1:36:42
We have a lot of great faculty here that we have given a good deal of
1:36:51
reign and rope to, they’ve responded marvelously to that, and we’ve
1:36:57
just seen tremendous things happen.
1:37:01
The growth has continued and I marvel at it.
1:37:06
I watch as our faculty continues with fewer and fewer appropriated dollars to
1:37:12
gather more and more outside grant money.
1:37:17
I keep thinking, “My God, this can’t continue,” but the reputation of this
1:37:21
faculty is such and the quality of the work they do is so high, that it
1:37:27
just keeps growing. We are the number one forestry research program among
1:37:32
universities in the country in terms of outside grant support. We’re 14th
1:37:38
in terms of state support.
1:37:40
So this is a great place to be and
1:37:45
we’ve done some things here,
1:37:49
things I’ve tried to do, to get us involved more in policy-level issues.
1:37:56
That’s been easy to do because the explosion that has occurred as a result
1:38:00
of the Northwest Forest Plan and the implications of that, but we’ve had
1:38:06
people take a tremendous amount of leadership in responding to those
1:38:11
and they’ve done those really well.
1:38:14
We’ve taken our own research forest and put in place a long-term plan for
1:38:20
that, which I think made it more of a research forest than it was before,
1:38:26
and that’s an ongoing evolution.
1:38:28
I see that as a kind of work in progress.
1:38:34
The big fight has been in holding the place together.
1:38:39
It’s like fighting a rear-guard action as the resources have continued to dwindle.
1:38:48
You mentioned fundraising as being more vital.
1:38:51
Yeah, outside fundraising is something Carl didn’t really need to
1:38:57
do in the same way we’ve had to do.
1:39:00
I spend a tremendous amount of time at that.
1:39:03
This building [Peavy Hall] was built with state funds, that building
1:39:06
that’s going into construction right now [Richardson Hall] , is going to
1:39:09
be built with 10 million dollars of federal funds, 14 million dollars of
1:39:12
private funds, and so a huge part of my days involves fund-raising stuff,
1:39:22
and I think it’s going to get worse rather than better.
1:39:24
I don’t see the State of Oregon coming to our aid in any foreseeable future.
1:39:32
I mean, hell, if we are in the middle of an economic boom as we are now, and
1:39:38
we can’t get enough money to run the universities, what’s it going to be when
1:39:42
we have an economic downturn, and we will?
1:39:46
That’s scary.
1:39:49
I’m curious about fundraising.
1:39:52
You likely know there are major donors likely to be turned off or turned on
1:39:56
by what’s going on at the Andrews?
1:39:59
Do you think?
1:39:59
At the Andrews?
1:39:59
The kind of research that’s going on there.
1:40:00
Nah, I don’t think
1:40:02
it makes a difference.
1:40:03
Don't pay much attention to it?
1:40:05
Well, no.
1:40:05
I think they pay attention to it, but I don't think people have the right idea.
1:40:10
They get the impression that industry is very vindictive and that
1:40:17
they’re watching over us closely.
1:40:19
Every time we talk, I go in public, and people ask questions like, how is
1:40:25
your research influenced by the fact that you get this harvest tax money?
1:40:29
And the answer is none at all.
1:40:32
The industry has never in my career come here
1:40:39
and raised hell with the college.
1:40:42
Oh, they raise hell with the college because they don’t like something, a
1:40:44
research result that doesn’t meet their preconceived notions, but they’ve never
1:40:48
been vindictive about that, they’ve never come at us and said, we’re going
1:40:51
to cut your budget because of what those yo-yos on the Andrews are doing.
1:40:55
That’s never ever happened.
1:40:58
Neither has it happened where they say, “Look, we want you guys to prove x, y, or,
1:41:04
z.” They’ve not coming at us with that.
1:41:06
They’ve said, we want you to do more research in fish and wildlife habitat,
1:41:11
because these are key issues for us, but they’ve never said we want
1:41:15
you to prove this or we want you to come up with this research result.
1:41:20
Never had that happen.
1:41:22
The money we get in harvest tax comes to us in a lump from the state, and
1:41:27
we have no idea who paid how much.
1:41:30
They send us a check quarterly, I send the money to the department heads mixed
1:41:35
with other funds, so they haven’t a clue and the faculty even less of a clue
1:41:41
where their appropriated funds come from.
1:41:44
They see a mix of harvest tax, general fund, and McIntire-Stennis money.
1:41:50
You just get a dollar and we worry about the bookkeeping in here.
1:41:57
So no, that doesn’t influence them.
1:42:04
If there is research they don’t like, they let me know about it, or ask
1:42:08
why in the hell is so-and-so doing or saying these kinds of things.
1:42:11
I get them calmed down and say, talk to the scientist.
1:42:15
Quite often where they hear about it is in the newspapers, which are
1:42:20
inaccurately reported in many cases.
1:42:23
Had a case of that not long ago.
1:42:29
But they’ve not been vindictive about that at all.
1:42:31
I mean, we’re collecting money right now for the building from a
1:42:36
host of large and small companies.
1:42:41
They see this place as a very important place and they’re not
1:42:45
going be vindictive about that.
1:42:49
I’ve talked to scientists
1:42:52
and there’s an interesting issue to address here.
1:42:53
Correct me if I’m wrong.
1:42:54
My understanding is that the fundraising for the College of Forestry
1:42:57
is the highest in the university, and it’s been going up recently.
1:43:03
At the same time the Andrews and the people at the Andrews, have been
1:43:07
getting into research that is highly controversial, and challenging a lot of
1:43:12
what forestry has done, including some of these large donors or their companies.
1:43:19
So, there is a seeming paradox there
1:43:27
– it sounds like you feel comfortable with telling them that they can go and talk
1:43:31
to the scientists, knowing the scientists will be able to communicate with them.
1:43:35
Isn’t this unusual?
1:43:36
Probably.
1:43:38
I mean we have some remarkable people here.
1:43:41
This ain’t your average dime store forestry school.
1:43:44
And they’re mature, and they’re by and large, people who communicate well.
1:43:54
The other thing is that they that they do their work well, and so when they
1:43:59
come up with research results, they’ve got a basis for saying whatever it
1:44:05
is they say, and you know it’s the business of incontrovertible evidence.
1:44:10
You may not like the results, but you’re going to have a hell of a time,
1:44:16
what number did you have that were bitter, that it’s that kind of a thing.
1:44:21
Some of these things may fly in the face of commonly accepted
1:44:26
knowledge, and all of that, but no, they are able to make their case.
1:44:33
Can you think of an example of someone who raised a question that
1:44:36
you directed to the scientist, and they were able to bring them back
1:44:40
on board or resolve their concerns?
1:44:54
Well, it’s happened a number of times, but at this moment late in the
1:44:57
afternoon, I can’t dredge up an example.
1:45:02
There is one, and this doesn’t have to do with Andrews research.
1:45:06
I
1:45:20
thought I would let you off the hook a little bit on this question.
1:45:24
What I’m really interested in here is how scientists perceive that kind of
1:45:29
interaction and how it relates to how they perceive their mission on the Andrews.
1:45:35
Can you think of any scientists that to whom you’ve sent people on
1:45:39
occasion talk about the research, some good examples of people who are
1:45:42
good communicators and successful at helping with the donors like that?
1:45:46
Hmm.
1:45:46
People that have been involved in the Andrews is what I’m
1:45:49
talking about.
1:45:50
People in the Andrews?
1:45:53
Well, I can’t think of a specific person.
1:45:59
We’ve had
1:46:02
a lot of folks down to the Andrews, we’ve had, this educator
1:46:07
team/educator day program, which included a significant number of CEOs.
1:46:15
We’ve had the OSU Foundation,
1:46:21
and the Council of Regents.
1:46:23
These are the big, big donors for the university, not just for the college.
1:46:27
They had a day-long field trip down there and they were just
1:46:31
blown away by what was going on.
1:46:34
We had these, and most were elderly people, and I was a bit
1:46:40
aghast, because the Andrews team was sort of tripping these guys.
1:46:46
I kept thinking, some of those old people are going to break if they fall!
1:46:50
But they were just really turned on by what they saw down there.
1:46:55
Do you know roughly when that was?
1:46:56
It’s been a couple of years ago.
1:46:58
Maybe three summers ago.
1:47:02
I’ll check with Fred [Swanson]
1:47:03
. Yeah, he’ll know when it was.
1:47:05
But those have been very positive kinds of experiences, and
1:47:12
we do interact with donors, not necessarily with Andrews’ people,
1:47:17
but we do get faculty in touch with potential donor people.
1:47:25
The most recent one I recall was Steve Strauss, one of
1:47:31
our Forest Geneticists, but
1:47:35
it happens all the time depending on what the donors’ interests are.
1:47:39
And I think Art was right, Stub Stewart, who has been a major donor to
1:47:43
the university, was really intrigued by what was going on down there
1:47:50
and this whole idea of large wood and stuff [leaving woody debris on
1:47:54
land] , which just really got him to thinking; he’s a unique character.
1:47:57
He’s a guy that’s in his mid-eighties now, and he was a CEO in the Bohemia
1:48:03
[Logging] Company before they sold that to Willamette Industries.
1:48:08
But Stub regularly goes on these science adventure trips, the kinds of things where
1:48:14
they’ll take small boats, and they’ll go to the Galapagos, or they’ll take a small
1:48:17
boat up the Amazon and get you into a zodiac and run you up some jungle stream.
1:48:22
I mean, he enjoyed that kind of stuff, so he was really intrigued, as others were.
1:48:32
Would he be good to talk to about this?
1:48:32
No, I don’t think so.
1:48:33
You’d have a hard getting a hold of him to do it.
1:48:36
But, again, it was because of who he was.
1:48:39
He was also Chair of the Forest Research Lab Advisory Committee.
1:48:43
So he has this kind of proclivity for forest science stuff.
1:48:51
Art said that he had an experience with him up there on one of
1:48:55
these trips, and he kind of pigeon-holed him and talked to him.
1:49:02
Yeah, exactly.
1:49:03
I know, he’s a great guy.
1:49:05
Can you think of perhaps somebody else, a
1:49:10
donor that might be interested and involved,
1:49:15
someone I could talk to.
1:49:17
None come to mind just concerning a specific location [Andrews] . We have
1:49:21
a lot of donors, obviously, but it’s a more generic interest in forestry
1:49:28
than just focused on the Andrews.
1:49:33
Stub’s focus was not on the Andrews.
1:49:35
The dollars he has given have been for forest genetics and a number of
1:49:41
other projects on the campus, but not specifically Andrews-related.
1:49:51
But none come to mind that are sort of an Andrews-focused issue.
1:49:56
Well, we’ve got the Andrews, you don’t have to tell me right now but if you think
1:49:59
of something or somebody let me know.
1:50:02
I don’t understand what you’re after.
1:50:03
I think what I’m looking for is someone who I could talk to who would be
1:50:08
interested in the programs at Oregon State University who would be conversant
1:50:12
in the science that is taking place.
1:50:20
Yeah, I think the zinger is, conversant in the science that’s taken place.
1:50:26
I think most of our donors are not what I would call conversant in the science.
1:50:35
They tend to give to us because they know we do good work kind of in general.
1:50:41
A lot of them are interested in undergraduate education as
1:50:45
much as they are in science.
1:50:50
Most of them couldn’t tell you specifically what’s going on at
1:50:54
the Andrews versus other places.
1:50:59
And I think that would be the case for even for people like Stub
1:51:03
Stewart, who kind of keep in touch with what’s going on in forestry.
1:51:11
And I think that’s probably a good thing, that is to say, we do not
1:51:15
have the Andrews over here, and then the rest of the forestry program.
1:51:20
It’s all kind of woven together.
1:51:23
And so being able to find someone who is, would be
1:51:31
specifically knowledgeable about that kind of research program, we
1:51:36
probably aren’t going to find it.
1:51:38
Most of our donors are elderly people, I mean they’re at that point in their
1:51:42
lives where they’ve got significant resources to share, and they just
1:51:48
don’t keep track of that stuff.
1:51:50
Well, I was just curious.
1:51:52
It would be helpful if I could get a great deal of talk about the Andrews about the
1:51:57
communication efforts, the interagency cooperation, and people I could talk to.
1:52:02
I’ve interviewed Mike Kerrick, I could talk to Bob Tarrant,
1:52:06
I’ve talked to you and others.
1:52:06
One of the key elements here is what the people at the Andrews
1:52:06
have tried to do, to come up with
1:52:13
kind of a paradigm for real world management that’s not
1:52:18
exclusive of timber production.
1:52:23
And you hopefully get that a perspective of that from the standpoint of someone
1:52:28
that’s evolved in the industry and hasn’t been close to the college
1:52:31
for a while, not necessarily the Andrews, but just in general terms
1:52:35
of a perspective of what’s going on.
1:52:40
I think the problem is, identification of that with the Andrews, enough
1:52:45
knowledge about what’s going on at the Andrews, to be able to
1:52:51
relate that in any kind of definitive way.
1:52:54
We’ve got a lot of people in the industry who are very knowledgeable about forestry,
1:52:59
obviously, but I doubt that even they would sort of be able to say, oh yes,
1:53:03
this is something that came out of there.
1:53:07
I don’t think they’d be able to do that.
1:53:12
We’re getting along here in time, but I was curious if you had any perspective
1:53:16
of how what’s been going on at the Andrews with Oregon State University
1:53:20
and the Forest Service, and whether that has changed expectations among your
1:53:26
peers or other institutions, of what to expect from an experimental forest?
1:53:31
No, I doubt that.
1:53:34
I’m not sure that other colleges, certainly the University of Washington
1:53:40
is well attuned to what we’re doing, and there will be other places as
1:53:45
well, but as a college kind of thing.
1:53:50
Most of the
1:53:53
college forests tend to be small, underfunded, and are not nearly
1:54:01
heavily utilized as this one is.
1:54:04
You are kind of on your own hook, if you will, for resources
1:54:09
to make the management occur.
1:54:12
Certainly that’s the way it is in the West, as sometimes
1:54:14
they’re quite remote from where
1:54:18
the college is headquartered.
1:54:20
I mean, it is unusual to have a research forest right next
1:54:24
door like we’ve got here.
1:54:28
Probably within an hour-and-a-half drive down to it.
1:54:31
Well, a lot of them are really an hour-and-a-half, but they’re
1:54:33
really not, because they’re an hour-and-a-half and they don’t take
1:54:37
students to them on a frequent basis.
1:54:40
And they don’t have the kind of research facility that you’ve got down there
1:54:45
because this one obviously came from federal origins, and the rest of us
1:54:49
have to scrounge from pillar-to-post to keep a program like that going.
1:54:56
Yeah, for example, at Cascade Head Experimental Forest.
1:55:00
Yeah, right.
1:55:03
Well, Cascade Head is nowhere near what the Andrews is.
1:55:05
I mean, it’s just kind of a small, satellite place.
1:55:10
Although it’s interesting many of the people at
1:55:14
the Andrews have worked there.
1:55:14
Oh, yeah, right.
1:55:15
Now don’t get me wrong.
1:55:16
I’m not trying to denigrate that, but as a facility it’s not
1:55:20
got near what this one’s got.
1:55:21
But, students are taken down
1:55:25
to the Andrews a great deal, although it is an hour- and-a-half away.
1:55:30
It’s kind of attracted people.
1:55:32
Yeah, but they go down there kind of special stuff for very long
1:55:36
kind of full day field trips.
1:55:37
What we have here on our research forest [McDonald-Dunn] is a chance
1:55:41
for students to go up there for a lab.
1:55:44
So they’re up there in twenty minutes, do their lab for an
1:55:47
hour-and-a-half, and come back.
1:55:49
You can’t do that in most places.
1:55:53
We have a lot of student traffic down there, don’t get me wrong,
1:55:55
and they tend to be Saturday trips.
1:55:57
Well, you’ve been very patient with me.
