00:03
Yeah, what we’re trying to do here is establish a record that will
00:30
be acceptable for not only people reading the book, but also for people who
00:34
might be interested in future research.
00:35
You bet.
00:37
What I try to get started out with here is a little bit of background information.
00:41
Okay.
00:42
From my understanding, you started working with the Andrews group
00:46
somewhere in about the beginning of the IBP, in the middle of the 1970’s.
00:48
Maybe you could talk about your academic and personal background
00:53
until that time, to get started.
00:53
Okay.
00:57
I completed a Ph.D. at the University of Georgia in 1973.
01:05
I came out here at the beginning of 1973, and had a one-year fellowship
01:11
with the U.S. Forest Service.
01:15
That was with Jerry Franklin and
01:22
his group at that time.
01:25
Then, the following year I joined Oregon State University in what had
01:29
been the Forest Management Department [College of Forestry] . That was all
01:33
during IBP [International Biological Program] . IBP started in earnest
01:38
about a year before I got here.
01:44
I was pretty early in it.
01:46
I actually got a one-year,
01:50
federal government internship, which were federal, government-wide.
01:53
They weren’t specifically forestry, but the Forest Service got a couple of them.
01:58
That’s how they were able to hire me.
02:02
Then I came on as a research associate post-doctorate
02:06
with Oregon State University
02:15
for the remainder of IBP.
02:16
1974 through ‘78?
02:17
Well, that part went through about
02:22
1977.
02:23
Then, we started getting some additional National Science Foundation grants.
02:29
They were kind of designed to go for a term or so after IBP, but
02:35
they still included some IBP-type
02:41
projects.
02:42
Then, years later, that led to the formation of the succession of grants
02:48
that led to the formation of the EER [Experimental Ecological Reserve] , and
02:51
ultimately the LTER you have now.
02:55
It was kind of a transition out of IBP.
03:02
I got a regular position at OSU about 1980 or so.
03:16
So, now you’re on regular appointment?
03:19
In what’s now the Forest Science Department.
03:23
When I came here with the Forest Management Department,
03:26
there had been a split to
03:30
form Forest Management and Forest Science.
03:32
[OSU
03:35
College of Forestry] That includes people like Dick Waring, and people like that.
03:50
Okay.
03:50
I was going to ask you about
03:56
your background.
03:56
I went to Texas Southwest Junior College in Brownsville, and I went
04:01
to University of Texas at Austin.
04:04
I did a Bachelor’s in Zoology, and a Master’s in Zoology.
04:10
The master’s work was in population ecology of arthropods,
04:17
which are decomposer organisms.
04:19
I then went to University of Georgia, and
04:26
after a couple years of course work there, the IBP was just starting there, also.
04:32
This was in the Deciduous Forest Biome [IBP category] . So, I
04:34
did my doctoral work at a place called Coweeta Hydrologic Lab,
04:41
which is now an LTER site, and I worked on nutrient- cycling and decomposition
04:47
in hardwood watersheds back there.
04:50
I came out here and continued similar research in the
04:55
Coniferous Forest Biome of IBP.
04:58
So, that was kind of a little background.
05:01
I was just looking at the chronology here.
05:05
You were at U of Georgia about the time that Art McKee was out
05:10
there.
05:10
Uh-huh [affirmative]
05:11
Did you know him when you were there?
05:11
Oh yes, I did.
05:11
We overlapped.
05:12
Art actually started out with Phil Johnson to pursue a degree.
05:16
Phil left to go to the National Science Foundation, and Art decided
05:20
to stick around that while the Andrews site manager job came up.
05:28
He was kind of between professors because his original major prof
05:31
had left, and he had a couple of years of coursework to get through.
05:35
He just decided to come on out here and take the job.
05:38
I think he eventually intended to go on for a degree again,
05:45
and he
05:47
took some courses here, but eventually, the way things worked
05:50
out, Art just kind of evolved into what has become his kind of job.
05:59
Did that play a role at all in why you came into ecosystem science here?
06:01
Well, there’s one person, unfortunately you’re not going to
06:07
interview, but you’ll hear about him, and that is Dick Fredriksen.
06:09
Sure, yeah.
06:10
Dick did a lot to pioneer some of the water sampling approaches,
06:15
but he came back from a trip to Coweeta to help him install one of
06:20
those proportional water samplers that’s a key part of his own work.
06:25
I met Dick and talked to him about the work out here.
06:30
So, through his contact, I
06:36
had an opportunity to come here and be a post-doc.
06:41
Those people played a role in getting me out here, plus Jerry Franklin
06:46
secured a one-year fellowship.
06:50
Had you known Jerry Franklin before?
06:52
I had not known Jerry, just his reputation as a plant
06:59
ecologist.
07:00
Well, the thing that was really important is that people like Dick
07:03
Fredriksen, Jerry Franklin, and Ted Dyrness, who were here with the Forest
07:09
Service, played a tremendously powerful role for those of us who weren’t
07:14
used to these particular forests.
07:16
Basically, getting us started, getting us oriented.
07:21
Jerry had developed a habitat-typing approach.
07:32
People like he and Dick Fredriksen took me around to all the watershed research sites
07:37
of the Andrews, right after I got here.
07:39
That was early in the winter of ‘93.
07:42
But, we were able to get started right away on the research, because
07:47
they got us oriented and sort of laid the groundwork for us.
07:52
And, we had technical help and financial support from the IBP
07:56
to start that research out.
07:57
Back up
08:00
just a minute here
08:01
Sure.
08:02
On the decision to go to Georgia from Texas, what was
08:05
the attraction again in Georgia?
08:07
The ecosystem part that Georgia was pioneering at that time.
08:15
And, I wanted to go on and do something more general, and
08:22
there were a number of people there that were influential.
08:25
Dave Coleman, who’s there now, is an ecosystem scientist
08:30
who had just joined there.
08:32
Odum, of course, was there, Eugene Odum, and my major professor,
08:37
Carl Monk, was there, who had worked on plant ecology at Rutgers
08:43
Carl?
08:43
Carl Monk
08:45
M-o-n-k?
08:46
M-o-n-k.
08:49
Okay.
08:50
Another thing that influenced my decision was the opportunity I had in 1966 with
08:56
a NSF fellowship to go to the University of Minnesota’s Itasca Biological Station.
09:01
That’s the forestry site on Lake Itasca, and they teach
09:07
courses there in the summer.
09:10
I had a plant ecology course under Murray Buell from Rutgers, who had
09:15
done all his work at Minnesota and knew a lot about Minnesota forests.
09:18
I really got introduced to forest ecology, plant ecology, in that ecosystem up there.
09:24
But, I didn’t really have any background in forest type exposure at Texas.
09:29
Yeah.
09:31
And Murray Buell was Carl Monk’s major professor, who then became
09:37
my major professor at Georgia.
09:39
So, there was a connection there and I had an interest in that and in the ecosystem
09:42
approach, so that’s why I went to Georgia.
09:46
While you were working at Georgia and at Coweeta, were you aware of things
09:51
going on at the Andrews at that time?
09:54
A little bit, but most of us were right in the middle of our graduate work.
09:59
One of the nice things about this whole IBP thing, was that they had
10:04
a fair bit of money for people to travel and put on workshops, to kind
10:09
of get across the biome boundaries.
10:12
And I did get to take part in one at North Carolina where some people
10:17
came out from the Andrews group.
10:21
We knew about the other biomes.
10:23
I went out to Colorado State to
10:28
the short-grass prairie site.
10:32
There was a site there in IBP and we worked on Pawnee Short-Grass site.
10:38
So, a lot of people were meeting each other across geographic
10:44
and disciplinary boundaries.
10:45
This was with IBP.
10:46
There was a big modeling effort there, to bring together people in
10:51
plant and animal ecology and soils.
10:53
It was a very great time to be in ecological ecosystems
10:58
research.
11:03
I wish we had similar opportunities now.
11:07
We have the LTER.
11:08
Still, I wish we had a similar kind of national effort to allow
11:11
the current generation of graduate students and post-docs to have
11:16
that kind of cross-fertilization.
11:18
We do at some levels, but we had a remarkable kind of national effort
11:24
behind that whole thing at that time.
11:26
You don’t see the IBP showing up in LTER?
11:28
Well, they do.
11:30
There’s is an outstanding network, okay.
11:32
I think what we need is also some educational funds to allow people to
11:37
move a little bit more between them.
11:42
To promote cross-fertilization?
11:43
Yeah, to promote more inter-site work.
11:47
I think we’d all benefit from that.
11:48
We had the basics there by just kind of adding some things
11:53
that strengthen the inner ties.
11:55
And it sounds like there will be some additional inter-site funds
11:59
for the next year or two to promote
12:03
them.
12:03
But, the other part was the strength of the foresters.
12:05
The foresters had an inspiration at Coweeta, and out here, having been all
12:13
the years of work in watershed studies and laying out all the stuff, we knew
12:17
about vegetation, all the basics that you would need to go in and start
12:21
a new study, had already been done.
12:24
Ted Dyrness has done a lot of work on soils.
12:27
Dick Waring was Jerry’s physiological ecologist, and he was ready to get
12:31
into ecosystems-style research.
12:34
There were a really good combination of
12:40
folks.
12:40
You could say IBP itself, but you have to add all the institutional support.
12:46
For me, the Forest Service was very important, as well as the National
12:51
Science Foundation, and Oregon State University was willing, too.
12:57
We had people working at the University of Oregon, and we had interchange
13:02
with the University of Washington, which made this whole effort possible.
13:06
If
13:08
you can think back to when you first started working there.
13:15
What did you perceive as being the opportunities or your
13:20
career goals at that time?
13:22
In relation to working with the IBP group at the Andrews, where
13:25
did you see that taking you?
13:26
I wanted to do good basic research in soil
13:33
ecosystems, related to how different water systems work, components
13:38
decompose, and how nutrients cycle.
13:41
This was an excellent place to do that.
13:43
So I felt that I had time, if I could get several good years of work done and out
13:48
in publications, whether I stay here or end up going somewhere else, that would
13:52
lay a real good groundwork for future work I wanted to do, and teaching that I
13:58
would eventually want to do, and students that I would eventually want to have.
14:02
So, you were looking at about a three or four-year investment of your time?
14:05
That was the initial outlook, sure, for I think the majority of the years.
14:09
Also,
14:12
many of us thought that there would be a career opportunities for people who were
14:16
trained from the ecosystem perspective.
14:21
We had a group of senior leaders, like Dick Waring and
14:24
Jerry Franklin, Stan Gessel
14:31
and
14:33
Carl Monk, and the people at Georgia.
14:38
They had come out of pretty classical disciplinary areas, but they were leading
14:42
this effort to do the ecosystem research.
14:45
They gave a large number of post-docs and graduate students a chance
14:49
to really get in on the ground floor of a new era in ecology.
14:57
I think it basically has worked out for many of us in that program, who have
15:03
had excellent career opportunities to do ecosystem-oriented research ever since.
15:07
So, you see a lot of people going off from the IBP into other leadership areas
15:13
then or with different organizations?
15:16
Oh, sure, in other areas.
15:19
I think it has strengthened nationally, the programs in a number of universities.
15:27
Cornell is one example
15:32
among many.
15:38
But do you see people from the Andrews from the Coniferous [Forest] Biome
15:43
taking those kinds of leadership roles on a national level, or
15:47
people that you worked with?
15:49
People from the Andrews have served in leadership positions at NSF, for example,
15:54
and at NASA, as program directors.
15:58
Jerry was a program director at NSF, Dick Waring is at NASA.
16:07
That’s one type of example.
16:11
Our better achieving students have done well getting jobs.
16:17
That to me, is one of the ways you’re going to train people and
16:22
move them out, and I think they have.
16:24
There’s a book coming out any day now, by Dick Waring and Steve Running, and Steve
16:33
Running was a master’s student here at the time of the IBP, Dick Waring’s student.
16:37
He was doing physiological modeling of trees and plant-water
16:41
relations, which lead to the development of one of the first
16:47
plant-oriented part of the structure of the hydrological
16:48
model Waring started working on.
16:52
Steve is at Montana.
16:53
He’s
16:56
just one example.
16:58
I had a student, Dan Binkley, who’s now a professor in Forest
17:02
Sciences at Colorado State.
17:04
He’s done a lot of ecosystems research.
17:08
What was his name?
17:08
Dan Binkley.
17:09
Dan Binkley?
17:09
And I have another student who did a masters with me, Richard
17:15
Boone, who’s at the University of Alaska, at the LTER up there.
17:22
Working with Keith Van Cleve?
17:23
No, Keith retired.
17:25
Unfortunately, a little too soon.
17:27
I wish he had not retired quite yet, but Rich is doing
17:31
forest soils research up there.
17:33
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your first impressions of the place
17:39
and people at the Andrews when you came here to start working with the IBP.
17:44
What’s your recollection of how the place struck you at the outset?
17:49
Well, I thought it was well-organized and well-structured, considering we
17:53
didn’t have very much in the way of actual facilities at the Andrews.
17:57
But, we had the watershed installations.
18:01
We had a little office down there at what was then the Blue River
18:05
Ranger Station, and we had a couple of trailers to stay in.
18:09
If you’re familiar with the whole layout of the Andrews
18:14
now, none of that was there.
18:19
You can see that we needed a good organization of the research and
18:24
support of that research down there.
18:28
That had all been pioneered.
18:30
It was starting in the early ‘60’s with the watershed-level research.
18:37
It was then kind of a remote area, but because all that structure
18:41
there, people knew their way around.
18:43
The senior people did, and people like Al Levno or one of the main
18:51
field technicians or the foresters, kept all that stuff running.
18:58
Even with the handicap of not having much in the way of facilities there, it
19:01
did not, except for the inconvenience of having to go back-and-forth, it didn’t
19:06
inhibit getting started right away on
19:10
stuff.
19:11
It’s the same thing in Coweeta, although Coweeta has a little bit
19:13
better facilities, I guess you’d say.
19:16
It had a little better lab and office facilities, because it was a
19:21
hydrologic station since the 1920’s.
19:25
It didn’t have a really good lab and research station
19:29
until a number of years later.
19:32
But it had the organization.
19:33
It had the background.
19:35
When you’re going into a new place, unless you’re clearly pioneering something there
19:40
like a survey or maps, you need that.
19:43
And we had the support here at OSU.
19:45
With this building, although partly-completed, we had excellent labs
19:50
and OSU gave us the support we needed for, in my case, chemical analyses, because
20:01
we already had been doing that, and we had a water lab here with the
20:07
Forest Service group.
20:13
By today’s standards it was not much, but we had a pretty good computer system,
20:18
and started early to try to manage data.
20:22
Like everybody else, we’ve had to learn a lot
20:31
about that.
20:33
You’ve probably seen or heard something about that history down
20:42
there.
20:42
You come here from a, like you say, fairly well-established site
20:47
like at Coweeta, to one that is on
20:51
the rise.
20:51
A major investment from IBP coming in and a lot of new people arriving.
20:57
What was your impression of the working group, the people that were coming in?
21:03
Tremendous amount of enthusiasm and cross-disciplinary discussions.
21:14
We really had an interest in ecosystem philosophies.
21:17
Not only on the land, but in the streams, also.
21:21
We had a very good stream group evolving and we were trying to get ideas about
21:25
how the forest and stream interacted,
21:30
because we did focus on a key watershed down there, which was Watershed 10.
21:36
That integrated a large part of the group effort.
21:38
Although in my case, I utilized habitat types spread across several locations
21:47
in addition to the Watershed 10, because it was starting to be cut.
21:50
So,
21:53
then we hired Fred Swanson to look at erosion processes.
22:00
We
22:02
were beginning work on modeling, at least conceptual modeling,
22:05
how the system tied together.
22:07
So, I think it enabled people to get some very good ideas.
22:12
We did have a watershed base to work upon, but the idea was to put together
22:16
integrated model structures for how these forests work, how forests and stream might
22:23
interact, what would be the short-term and long-term erosion processes.
22:28
And it was amazing just to think about it.
22:31
Fred Swanson, for example, was trained originally as a volcanologist.
22:36
He actually wanted to study volcanoes, but he also wanted to study near-term erosion
22:41
processes, and he kind of made a career choice, kind of with the Forest Service.
22:45
He said, “Well, I kind of have to give up volcanoes, because
22:47
it’s never going to happen.” So, what happened a few years later?
22:51
He was the main expert they had already hired.
22:55
Fred could turn right around and point north, and be ready
23:00
to lead on Mount St. Helens.
23:02
That’s kind of a fortuitous coincidence.
23:04
People like Jim Sedell, who got interested in what happened to Spirit Lake.
23:08
So, I mean, that was a really unanticipated opportunity.
23:12
Nobody could have foreseen that.
23:14
But I do think the leadership here promoted a very good atmosphere for
23:21
integration of ecosystem processes.
23:29
We were encouraged just to work hard on our specialties, but we
23:33
were not isolated specialties, as we worked in integrated groups.
23:37
And I think that made a tremendous difference.
23:41
Would you see it as a function of the university, or with
23:42
your group in particular?
23:44
Well, I would say, the overall group here, which included the
23:47
university [OSU] and Forest Service.
23:49
I mean, some of the people in the Forest Service were adjuncts of the
23:54
university, but I think of it as sort of a unified whole, personally.
23:59
As you pointed out, you have a similar structure as at Coweeta
24:03
with the cooperation of a university and the Forest Service.
24:06
Was there a distinct difference here in terms of the climate for that
24:09
kind of disciplinary involvement?
24:11
I think they were both very good.
24:14
I
24:17
was quite early in the Coweeta group.
24:19
They didn’t have much stream research.
24:20
When I first came, they were just starting it.
24:22
So, more of their integration came a little bit after I left there, whereas I
24:31
finished my doctorate and came out here, during the formation of some of that.
24:34
So, it’s not that one necessarily had it better, truly, than the other, it’s just
24:40
they were about a year or so out of phase.
24:43
If I had stayed on as a post-doc there at Coweeta, for example, which could have
24:48
been a possibility, I would have probably worked with that group for a while.
24:58
We had a goal to try to really understand ecosystems.
25:02
To
25:04
try to get a really good understanding of ecosystem functions, given the
25:08
structure of these forests that we had, and their complexity.
25:12
So, it was things like that that enabled people to start thinking
25:14
about the roles of some of the trees that make coarse woody debris.
25:20
As an organic matter component in these forests, and ultimately as a
25:26
nutrient-cycling component and as a wildlife component, and all the other
25:29
things that have been done since then.
25:32
I think we’ve been able to open up a remarkable number of doors, you
25:37
know, into the future.
25:38
I’m curious.
25:39
You mentioned working with Al Levno when you first got here.
25:44
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the kinds of interaction you had with
25:47
different groups like technicians at the Andrews, or other people at the
25:51
district [Blue River RD] down there.
25:52
You mentioned using the facilities there.
25:53
What was the degree of interaction with people?
25:54
Well, they helped us put out and set things up, helped find places.
26:00
It was
26:03
kind of an efficiency process.
26:04
You can do it all yourself, or you go out and have somebody help you for a
26:08
couple days and get ahead by a factor of
26:14
several days.
26:14
Al would go down there to service the samplers.
26:19
Dick [Fredriksen] would also go along.
26:21
But,
26:24
they took time out to take me around, as did other people.
26:28
Because I wanted to look at litter decomposition, and on a habitat
26:33
gradient, which is basically a micro-environment gradient from
26:36
the dryer to the wetter side.
26:39
We could look at gradients, which will allow us then to integrate
26:43
across types of habitats that occur on the watersheds, like Watershed 10.
26:49
But I didn’t know where all those [places] were, but they
26:51
had mapped all this stuff out.
26:52
So, there was a good infrastructure there of information for locating your plots?
26:59
Getting all that was done very, very efficiently on the Andrews.
27:02
Well, just kind of bringing me up to speed on the plant
27:06
communities and so forth out here.
27:07
Because up to that point in time, I’d had plant ecology in Minnesota
27:12
and worked at Coweeta, but I had not been exposed to western forests.
27:17
I mean they’re so different, because they’re big and old and evergreen.
27:21
At least, there’s this old-growth hemlock at Coweeta, but you don’t
27:27
get much feel of the old growth here.
27:31
Coweeta had another big interesting phenomenon in that there had been the
27:35
chestnut blight there in the 1930’s, which wiped out about half of the trees
27:40
in that entire basin, of “old-growth” chestnuts, well, “mature” chestnuts.
27:46
Some of which were over 200 years in age.
27:49
I looked at some of the rings in a few of the downed trunks.
27:53
Even
27:55
though it had not been logged since the 1920’s when they did selective
28:01
logging, it was not pristine or as undisturbed as the Andrews.
28:09
Did you see that as offering unique research opportunities?
28:13
What?
28:13
The different kind of a forest you’re concerned with here
28:17
[research opportunities]
28:18
? Well, I wanted to look at the role of chemical substrate quality of litter,
28:27
and that includes things such as different as Douglas-fir and dogwoods
28:32
and some of the [understory] plants, because of their soil-building qualities.
28:38
And the other nice thing that I got to do out here, kind of just immediately
28:44
post-IBP on the Andrews, was to look at
28:49
post-fire succession.
28:50
So, I got to do two very interesting projects on that, one with my
28:55
student Dan Binkley, and another with Dave McNabb, who was here.
29:09
I thought that would be something that would be important for management, given
29:12
that these are fire-prone ecosystems, given that, maybe we’re thinking of
29:18
going back to use of fire in management.
29:26
So, we need to know more about the understory plants.
29:29
And knowing more about the understory plants, you need to know what they
29:33
contribute to the nutrient cycle process.
29:35
Even though their productivity may not always be very great, they’re
29:40
there for a long period of time.
29:41
And in older succession, they dominate the sites.
29:44
I did have a chance to do some interesting new work that I
29:49
really am very interested in.
29:52
And another thing I got started on in Coweeta and pursued here was work on
29:57
the role of fungi in nutrient cycling.
29:58
Was
30:03
that affected by the difference among species?
30:05
I was interested in the role of fungi in the ability to network
30:10
in the soil and litter, both as decomposers and as mychorrizae, to
30:15
intercept and recycle nutrients.
30:17
So, they’re critically important in sort of helping tie the rhizosphere, the root
30:23
zone, the litter zone and rotting wood and all that; all those things together.
30:30
The dominant sort of microorganisms do about 90% of the decomposition,
30:38
and fungi do a big part of that.
30:41
Bacterials are important, but we’ve had some really nice chances
30:45
to try to look at how mychorrizae functions in these forests.
30:49
Which ties back into what I call all the “belowground.” So
30:55
that’s some of the research I’ve been doing.
30:56
So,
30:59
you started that as a post-doc.
31:02
You’re mentioning several of these students that you’re working with.
31:04
Do you take on students?
31:05
Well, I also had a student here who worked with me.
31:08
His name was Robert Fogel, Bob Fogel.
31:12
He was a Ph.D. student with Jim Trappe.
31:15
But he worked as my research assistant for the first three years that I was out here.
31:21
He helped me do the litter decomposition research while finishing his own
31:27
Ph.D., which was in mycology.
31:30
He was looking at the taxonomy of micro-active fungi.
31:38
He and Jim Trappe helped me get started doing
31:44
research in my garage.
31:46
Bob finished his Ph.D. here, and he stayed and got his own
31:50
post-doctoral funds to do some work on
31:56
mycorrizhae studies.
31:57
Then he got a job at the University of Michigan in Ann
31:59
Arbor, and is now a professor.
32:05
Again, it was because of the entire group that’s here, there
32:08
was a lot of interesting times.
32:10
But there was a person here by the name of Chet Youngberg, who had actually
32:14
been Ted Dyrness’ major professor, who had done research on soils and
32:21
had done some very nice work on it, as had some of Chet’s students.
32:27
One of his students, Dave McNabb, came over and worked with me
32:33
on a project at the Andrews.
32:38
Chet had a small but important part in the IBP program, too.
32:43
He did soils work on the Andrews, and some of his students did
32:47
some projects on the Andrews.
32:49
And then, of course, Ted had been his Ph.D. student, so he
32:53
had an interaction in that.
32:55
He just died here this last fall, I guess.
33:07
Both Jim and
33:09
Jerry had appointments in botany, and Jerry I guess had appointments
33:12
both in botany and forestry.
33:15
I’m
33:23
curious to know about interactions with people in the district,
33:27
staff at the Blue River station.
33:29
Was there much interaction with them in terms of locating
33:31
sites on or off the Andrews?
33:35
Well, I didn’t have much interaction with the actual district staff at that time.
33:38
It was really only later when we evolved a much broader working
33:43
relationship with what became the
33:48
EER and the LTER, that we had silviculturists dedicated
33:50
to the Andrews program.
33:51
I mean, more of that staff was dedicated to specific project ties with the LTER.
33:56
They gave us access, but I think it was the PNW Station folks
34:00
who really facilitated things at that time when I was first here.
34:06
The district folks were just kind of doing the district things, I mean,
34:11
I don’t think they were terribly interested in ecosystem studies.
34:17
So, the PNW Station was really the more involved ones?
34:20
Yeah, they were the leaders on that.
34:23
Now, we’ve evolved I think to what once was described as a pretty good partnership
34:29
with the Blue River Ranger District.
34:33
You know, district rangers back in those days were still kind of in charge of
34:38
timber operations and that kind of thing, and I don’t think they and the research
34:43
community were interacting very well.
34:46
There was hope that would happen, and I think it has happened,
34:50
more as time has gone by.
34:51
Do you see what I’m saying?
34:53
I don’t think it’s unique to the Blue River Ranger District.
34:57
Now you’re with the Forest Service?
34:59
No.
35:00
Right now I’m on appointment at OSU.
35:02
I’m actually a historian with Western Oregon University
35:10
[in Monmouth, Oregon]
35:10
. You’d get a better appraisal of that from people like Jerry Franklin,
35:15
depending on who was district ranger.
35:17
Some were interested, some were not very interested, and some couldn’t care one
35:21
way or the other, in the early days.
35:26
The critical thing, was that places like the Andrews, Coweeta, and several
35:29
of these places around the country got set up as experimental forests.
35:33
Not all of them succeeded, but out of that entire matrix, some did succeed,
35:39
and it allowed the research contingent of the Forest Service to develop and
35:44
do some meaningful long-term studies.
35:48
I’m curious about knowing how the relationship changed over time.
35:53
One of the factors there is the management of the growing number of
35:58
scientists on the Andrews in this period.
36:00
Was there a regular check-in procedure, or people you advised where your study sites
36:06
were, so you didn’t overlap those people?
36:09
In the beginning, it was quite informal because there were so few
36:12
of us, and we had Watershed 10.
36:16
We did have information, but there wasn’t a lot of formal structure.
36:23
There weren’t many people, as it was a fairly small number of people, and
36:25
people like Art McKee in key positions.
36:30
I think his role was at that time more facilitation and support,
36:37
what became the evolution of the Quantitative Services Group and
36:41
data bank [Forest Science Data Bank/FSDB] , and the need to manage
36:44
data and document studies better.
36:46
Then, came a much better appreciation of where things might overlap.
36:52
Now we have GIS: geographic information systems.
36:55
We just didn’t have all of that infrastructure.
36:59
I guess there was some chance that people could accidentally step on each other’s
37:03
toes, but we had very little of that.
37:06
You just worked through Art mainly?
37:07
We worked through Art, and people knew each other, and people
37:11
knew where things were going on.
37:13
They kind of knew where each other’s sites were.
37:15
So, we didn’t have any problems.
37:20
Now it’s a much bigger organization
37:25
with lots more people in it to manage.
37:26
There’s a lot more people-managing going on.
37:28
Sure.
37:29
But there’s also a lot better documentation work by far being done.
37:34
I was curious how those kinds of processes changed during the
37:38
time you were involved there.
37:40
How would you characterize your level of involvement in decision-making
37:44
about how to run things at the Andrews?
37:47
I had really no involvement in that.
37:50
I think that was true mostly with the
37:55
age class of researchers that came in here.
37:58
We were given a lot of latitude to concentrate on the problem.
38:03
We didn’t worry much about management.
38:08
I wasn’t told to go down and manage Art McKee for the next three
38:12
months or something like that.
38:14
They interfaced directly with people like Waring and Franklin.
38:20
Number one, we didn’t really need to do that.
38:21
Number two, I think it worked a lot better to have pretty much
38:26
senior leadership for this stuff.
38:27
Do
38:29
you see what I’m getting at?
38:30
Yeah.
38:31
So, that left us a lot more time to work with each other, a lot less red tape.
38:37
There
38:40
are many senses of that term, but we didn’t have to worry about management.
38:47
Like now with the LTER meetings each month, there wasn’t anything
38:51
formally-structured like that at the time?
38:53
We had meetings, but they were more science and integration-oriented.
38:58
We did have organizational ones, periodically, particularly at the
39:03
beginning of the field season each year.
39:04
But with a much smaller organization, you really only needed a couple of those
39:09
per year to kind of keep things on track.
39:11
Now they have monthly meetings.
39:14
If you’ve been to a couple of them, you see how structured they are.
39:18
We had some definite structure, but you could basically organize things
39:22
for the field season in late May or early June, get together and kind
39:26
of plan what was going to happen.
39:29
And if there was going to be logging somewhere, and then we had to be aware
39:32
of the logging stuff, things like that.
39:36
Safety concerns they were quite good at calling our attention to
39:44
it.
39:44
I’m also curious where you stayed while you were working there.
39:46
Did you tend to drive down to the Blue River to work each
39:49
day, or did you stay overnight?
39:51
We had a couple of trailers and somebody could camp out.
39:56
Often, we’d go down for two or three days, just because of logistics.
40:00
I did a fair number of one-day runs, especially in the summer
40:04
when you could get in long hours.
40:07
But, we had enough, just enough.
40:09
We were a small group with a couple of trailers, so we were able to make it work.
40:16
We got by with that for I don’t know how many
40:22
years.
40:22
When we got the beginnings of funding for
40:27
the full site together, we built a garage.
40:30
There’s
40:32
still part of that thing left.
40:34
Other than the two trailers and that one garage when you first come into the
40:36
Andrews site, which was a good storage depot for stuff, that’s all we had.
40:41
And then, a couple of small trailers put out up on Mack Creek for overnight
40:47
stays, because some of the stream group would go up there doing storm watches,
40:50
and they needed to stay overnight in inclement weather and for safety reasons.
40:54
If somebody got hurt or a road got closed, you want to have a place for
40:59
people to stay out of the weather.
41:01
They also built this log cabin on Mack Creek.
41:06
The other thing was when the full IBP came in, at sort of an end of an era
41:11
when NSF had been supporting building a lot of field station facilities.
41:15
They were supporting this big national research effort, and they were just
41:19
kind of finishing a big building stage.
41:22
It was still going on, and we got around to wanting to put a major
41:27
installation in, but it was kind of hard going, because they weren’t
41:31
wanting to do that much anymore.
41:34
Art and Jerry had to work years and years, numerous grants, to get
41:37
all the pieces of that together.
41:40
I think they can be credited, along with people helping them, with
41:43
a major effort in getting that whole facility thing together.
41:49
I guess this was so that the NSF could move to a different emphasis?
41:53
Well, they had put a lot of work into building up field stations, and they
41:56
felt that, I think, they had done that.
42:00
There were excellent ones in existence, and
42:04
in some ways I think they were kind of hoping that the Forest Service, for
42:07
example, might want to do that, but it was encountering some budget considerations.
42:11
It wasn’t ready to build a field station itself, either.
42:16
Kind of like, each party would say, “Why don’t you do it?” No, “Why don’t you
42:19
do it?” So for several years, we went back-and-forth, and not much got done.
42:24
It was kind of critical because we were evolving
42:30
along the way towards the EER, which was the predecessor to the LTER,
42:36
with only minimal facilities, and now we’re up to nearly full facilities.
42:43
If we get a bit more laboratory and classroom space down
42:47
there, we’ll be able to really
42:50
do both the research and teach down there.
42:54
See, the other thing was that a lot of people wanted to do some teaching
42:57
at the Andrews, but they had to take classes down for a day or overnight,
43:01
or we’d have these short courses in the summer where people would camp out.
43:04
We didn’t have the facilities for doing that kind of
43:09
thing either.
43:09
So, there’s a lot that, probably more of that [teaching] would have been done
43:11
if we’d had the facilities earlier.
43:13
But, at the same time, I would say the lack of facilities didn’t
43:16
really inhibit us from getting a lot of stuff done in the beginning.
43:20
It did make it less efficient, though.
43:22
Were there ways you had to compensate for that?
43:25
Well, I don’t know that you compensate for low efficiency.
43:28
You just don’t get as much done, if you had to drive down and
43:33
have to bring all your gear and stay a couple days and come back.
43:37
That’s less efficient than having your stuff down there, when you can go down
43:40
and work for several days and come back.
43:42
That’s what people did.
43:45
But it didn’t affect the kinds of studies that you put in?
43:48
No, it didn’t.
43:50
It just meant that we had a little bit more extended travel time back-and-forth.
43:59
Was there any impact on the kinds of people you could recruit
44:01
to help you work down there?
44:04
We had good support for the task force people.
44:09
We had started those who worked through the whole organization.
44:15
And the counterpoints in the Forest Service like Al Levno and Ross Mersereau.
44:21
I had Bob Fogel.
44:24
They hired a guy by the name of Mike McCorison, who helped set up the entire
44:28
Watershed 10 sediment sampling network.
44:30
Mike who?
44:30
Mike McCorison, M-c-C-o-r-i-s-o-n.
44:35
I think just one “r”.
44:43
We
44:45
had a small, but critical group of field-technical people that
44:48
went back-and-forth, and helped keep everything running for us.
44:52
These were the people on-site there, when you were up here trying to do studies?
44:55
And then, there were individual professors who had graduate students working, so
44:59
all that made a pretty good network.
45:02
Looking back, it’s kind of remarkable to me how much we could do and did get
45:06
done, considering we didn’t have the facilities down there that we do now.
45:12
Was there much interaction with local residents in Blue River?
45:16
Were people hired from the community to work?
45:17
There was some hiring in Bend, as I recall.
45:22
We didn’t have what we now have, which is that the Forest Service has evolved
45:28
a much better structure to educate the public about its activities.
45:35
There at the ranger station [Blue River RD] , you could stop and get a map or
45:39
some information, but couldn’t stop in and learn about ecosystem research.
45:46
In other words, whether it was a local resident or a traveler, there
45:49
wasn’t much there to inform people.
45:52
And we didn’t have a headquarters to set up anything like that.
45:59
I don’t know if that meant some foregone opportunities to get
46:02
the residents a little more educated about what we were doing.
46:07
There’s a small number of local people.
46:09
So, they didn’t come beating down your door looking for work?
46:11
No, they didn’t.
46:12
And we didn’t go beating down their doors and seeing if they heard
46:15
about it, but they didn’t know a lot about what we were doing.
46:20
I think now we’re in a much better position to educate all
46:24
levels of people who come there.
46:27
We’re obviously geared to disseminate information here at
46:30
the university, for students.
46:31
We might as well be in a position to educate
46:39
the general public.
46:40
Also, it’s the general public that was paying the tax bill for IBP.
46:52
You keep talking about how you
46:56
would identify as your primary audience.
46:59
Who do you think you should be communicating your results of research to?
47:04
Well, I think my primary audience was and is the research community, primarily, and
47:11
secondly, management, of course, to the degree that we can learn from the basic
47:18
science studies of how to manage forests.
47:22
That’s what I’ve been trained to do.
47:26
But, I also feel
47:30
that there should be people who can take this information and bring it down to
47:38
primary and secondary education levels in this country,
47:44
and to the public-at-large.
47:47
In terms of what your particular responsibilities are concerning writing
47:51
for other researchers and managers, who have helped you reach other audiences?
47:56
I’ve taken part in some educational programs and extension workshops
48:01
to work with training Forest Service professionals, such as
48:05
silviculturists, about ecosystem studies.
48:08
We have a thing here called the “Silviculture Institute,” which was
48:12
active until just the last year or so.
48:16
It was active for
48:20
almost 15 years.
48:23
And there was a short course designed to bring people back for two week modules,
48:27
and we did an ecosystem module here.
48:31
So, we had some training, because many of the folks that had gone through
48:35
and gotten degrees in forestry, had not been exposed to what was
48:39
going on in ecosystems research.
48:42
They had a basic degree in forestry maybe ten, twenty years ago.
48:47
Some of them got their degrees at or before we were just
48:51
cranking up this kind of work.
48:53
It wasn’t in the textbooks; it wasn’t in the courses.
48:56
So, we had that kind of educational effort.
48:58
We’ve had to continue a lot of extension activities.
49:02
We’re doing less of that at the moment only because the funding
49:06
is down in the Forest Service.
49:11
Forest Service managers that were cycled in here for training?
49:13
Also forest scientists, wildlife biologists, and a lot of professionals.
49:18
I’m not sure, I think, Lynn Burditt was one of the people that cycled in for that.
49:24
I don’t know whether she did.
49:27
If she didn’t do it here, she may well have done it somewhere else.
49:30
She did something at OSU.
49:30
I can’t remember if it was this particular program or not.
49:34
Well, there are now a number of people who went through that program and
49:38
went on to become district rangers.
49:41
I don’t have the full list, but it’d be interesting.
49:45
You could probably get a list.
49:48
Anyway, that certainly helped a lot.
49:52
The one area I see needing more work, is to get it down to
49:56
primary and secondary education and more into the general public.
49:59
That’s a
50:02
current need?
50:04
I think it’s a continuing need because we are trying to involve
50:08
public in a lot of decisions about the management of our public lands.
50:14
So, an informed public would be nice to have.
50:17
It’s a complex issue.
50:19
Just to clarify things for me.
50:20
The Silviculture Institute was offered by Oregon State
50:23
University, or by the Andrews Group?
50:25
That was operated by Oregon State University.
50:28
Okay.
50:28
Then, people would need to know, what is Andrews, and what is not.
50:30
We have had short term extension courses that were done on the Andrews.
50:34
This one had some field trips to Andrews, but it was headquartered here.
50:39
There had been, I don’t know if people like Jerry Franklin talked about it, but
50:44
he originated some programs to bring in folks just to the Andrews like for a week,
50:52
and to do a grand tour of the studies there, and then, different people would
50:56
talk about their studies in the field.
50:58
And they still are doing some of that.
51:02
I’ve got some copies of the early draft from the first program.
51:07
I think one of the earliest that would
51:11
have been done is probably the early 80’s.
51:11
Yeah, that seems about right.
51:12
Seems about right.
51:13
Maybe as early as ‘79 or so, I don’t know.
51:18
Silviculture Institute didn’t get going until
51:22
… wish I could tell you the date on that, certainly by 1980, it was started.
51:28
And actually, Dick Waring was one of the first leaders of it.
51:38
Maybe you could talk
51:43
a little about your perception of how the decision-making process of
51:46
the Andrews group has changed in the time you’ve been associated with it.
51:50
Initially, there was not much involvement by people below the level of Jerry
51:56
Franklin and Dick Waring, I think.
51:59
We were allowed to make our own decisions about our own research, once we were
52:04
recruited to do work in a particular area.
52:09
All the day-to-day decisions about my own work with
52:14
Chris and Bob Fogel, and with help I got from people like Dick Fredriksen and Al
52:18
Levno, I got to make my own decisions, so I could carry on my own research.
52:27
But I wasn’t making the major decisions, about let’s say hiring post-docs
52:34
or managing research funds.
52:37
We did get to help with some of the NSF reports, writing some of them.
52:42
We got to help work on some of the budgets, stuff like that.
52:47
It was just such smaller, sort of close-knit group that we
52:55
didn’t need a real formal sort of hierarchical structure to make it work.
52:59
It worked quite well with people like Dick and Jerry and me at the main institutions.
53:06
Plus, you know they kept up with what we were doing.
53:11
How would you view that change in your career since you’ve been
53:14
associated with the group since then.
53:18
What would you identify as some of the more important changes?
53:20
Well, some of it is organizational.
53:23
People like Jerry eventually left here, and went to the University of Washington.
53:33
Dick Waring stayed here,
53:43
and did other things.
53:47
Ten or twelve years ago, Dick Waring decided to get involved with NASA,
53:52
because they were starting to do
53:57
surveys of planet Earth in conjunction with their planetary exploration program.
54:02
They showed that they didn’t really know a lot about planet Earth.
54:06
Ironically, because they didn’t.
54:08
And this was one of the first efforts at use of remote sensing imagery,
54:13
and everything began to evolve as remote sensing and GIS and all
54:17
that technology came into being.
54:18
So, Dick got involved with NASA to try to educate them more so that they
54:25
could address landscape, regional, and even global sort of questions.
54:31
He sort of got out of the Andrews thing in order to get into the NASA work.
54:38
He still is very interested in ecosystem level applications,
54:41
but he went off in that direction and he gave up some leadership.
54:48
And then Jerry eventually left here, so other leaders came into being.
55:05
Jerry went to Washington and got a whole new set of things going, and
55:09
eventually got the funding together for the Wind River Canopy Crane
55:13
set up, all that sort of thing.
55:17
So, this was a fairly smooth transition then from Waring and Franklin?
55:21
Well, I don’t know how to describe it.
55:24
It was kind of a natural change in career direction and interest for them.
55:29
Whether it was smooth or not, I’m not going to judge.
55:35
But nationally, the program for what became the LTER system was evolving.
55:44
I believe Jerry and Dick were still here working with this group, maybe
55:49
not full-time, but were here when the first LTER proposal was put together.
55:55
So, they did take us through the IBP and several years post IBP, up to kind
56:01
of the doorstep of LTER, if you will.
56:06
Parts of what was called the EER.
56:13
So, once the LTER was started, it was kind of a natural transition
56:20
[point for them] . Dick got involved in that and then Jerry
56:22
left for University of Washington.
56:24
So, their own interests diverged from here and from each other’s interests.
56:48
Could you talk about how your own career goals and your perceptions of
56:55
your area of specialization, changed in that time, and different models
56:59
or paradigms of research that might have paralleled that transition?
57:05
The IBP in immediate post-doc years, certainly did make it possible
57:14
for us to put together some of the first
57:20
pretty-detailed ecosystem level budgets, for
57:25
not only the structure of system, but also dynamics of the system.
57:30
That was a major synthetic effort of the group.
57:32
What I think many of us have been doing since, depends on people’s interests.
57:36
They have
57:38
diverged.
57:38
For myself, I’ve been very much interested in focusing on
57:42
below-ground ecosystem processes.
57:45
There’s a lot we didn’t know then and we still don’t know now, there’s a lot to do
57:54
there.
57:54
So that has been a pretty good pick up?
57:56
It’s pretty good.
57:59
We had the opportunity to put together major ecosystem models.
58:03
I’ve been interested in looking at below-ground ecosystems
58:03
functions, gotten off a lot of into work on mycorrhizal fungi.
58:03
Some of it continues on the Andrews, some of it continues
58:05
elsewhere in the Northwest.
58:05
Usually I’ve been
58:15
involved in fires and fire ecosystems.
58:25
I got that interest from a project on the Andrews, but I’ve been interested
58:32
in fire in east side forests and
58:39
its impact on nitrogen-cycling, wood decomposition, and
58:46
ecosystem recovery, from fire.
58:50
We’re faced now with having to deal with the consequences of many decades
58:53
of fire suppression in the forest, how we’re going to get that back in there,
59:03
and avoid big, big, total landscape fires.
59:09
People are learning how to do it, experimenting with or doing it
59:11
on a smaller scale, but they’re not really able to do it on a big
59:19
scale, on a scale of many, many thousands of acres, but they’re trying to get there.
59:21
We’ve got literally millions of acres to deal with.
59:27
So, it seems different, but it is ecosystem application, because one of
59:32
the things the Andrews taught us is that you have to look at disturbance
59:37
as being part of the system; they’re not undisturbed entities.
59:39
Fire is rare over here.
59:40
Windstorms may be more common.
59:44
Insects and diseases are in all these forests.
59:50
Another important area is to look at is the effects that pests and pathogens have.
59:54
I’ve been
1:00:00
working on that.
1:00:04
People were going to have a project up there to look at the impact of
1:00:07
forest diseases on ecosystem processes.
1:00:11
Since it’s a very nutrient-limited forest, we’re going to have
1:00:13
very large disease centers.
1:00:19
What we’ve done is to use some of the other forests around
1:00:22
here, as sort of satellite places to do selected components.
1:00:28
You can see we do all these things on the Andrews, but on the other hand, you
1:00:33
can take advantage to satellite areas.
1:00:38
At least that’s what I’ve been doing for mine.
1:00:40
As the IBP began to wind down,
1:00:45
you participated in jobs in other regions.
1:00:48
You stayed here, but your work began to spread out a little.
1:00:53
Is that because of changes in the policy concerns or
1:01:00
more just in your research interests and [funding] opportunities?
1:01:02
I would say more my research interests and opportunities.
1:01:03
But, I managed to be in policy management [related arena]
1:01:09
, trying to improve management,
1:01:13
that’s what I would
1:01:17
say.
1:01:17
You’re suggesting though, that your lessons learned from the Andrews,
1:01:17
some of that informed your choice of the kind of research you did?
1:01:18
Right.
1:01:18
How would you characterize your current involvement with the LTER group and the
1:01:32
Andrews group?
1:01:35
One major research project I’ve had going on down there looks at the effects
1:01:39
of water chemistry on decomposition.
1:01:45
I had
1:01:48
several years before that
1:01:54
from about ‘86 to ‘94, when we had a period of research on mycorrihizae, and
1:01:59
some of that was done at the Andrews.
1:02:04
Then, since about ‘94 to now, we’ve been focusing on water quality stuff.
1:02:08
Some of our main research sites are at the Andrews, so we’re still using it.
1:02:13
And who would you identify as kind of your leading collaborators?
1:02:17
Well, Robert Griffiths here at OSU.
1:02:21
Bruce Caldwell.
1:02:21
I have a master’s student, Illyana Balachovic, B-a-l-a-c-h-o-v-i-c,
1:02:33
who’s completing her master’s research on that project, which
1:02:36
should be done by this spring.
1:02:39
What about
1:02:49
your current involvement with decision-making on the Andrews
1:02:52
or with the LTER group here?
1:02:54
I have no involvement with that.
1:02:56
You don’t get involved with the LTER meetings?
1:02:59
I go to them occasionally, but I’m not involved with the main
1:03:10
group, you know, the main decision-makers.
1:03:13
I’m curious about the
1:03:18
connections of the IBP people after you’ve left here.
1:03:23
Would you identify yourself as being fairly typical in that regard?
1:03:29
I think so.
1:03:30
I think we retain a lot of our original interest in the
1:03:34
big picture of the ecosystem.
1:03:37
But, we’ve had our own career paths, and we have a remarkable amount of
1:03:43
freedom and opportunity to work together.
1:03:45
As a young, evolving group, we’ve developed our specialties.
1:03:50
I’d assume
1:03:54
nearly all the people who’ve stayed in the research arena have continued to
1:04:00
do some type of ecosystems research.
1:04:03
Whether they stay working here or elsewhere or with each
1:04:07
other in the original group.
1:04:08
People like Jim Sedell about stream ecosystem
1:04:17
research.
1:04:17
Fred in erosion and geomorphology research.
1:04:19
Both he and Jim are more into a little more administrative stuff, so they
1:04:23
don’t have as much time for that.
1:04:26
I don’t have administrative work, so that’s why I have more
1:04:29
time for research than they do.
1:04:31
You’ve mentioned quite a few students that you’ve worked with and my impression
1:04:36
is that you tend to work with graduate students more than with post-docs.
1:04:40
That’s right.
1:04:41
Students.
1:04:41
Is that a choice?
1:04:43
Well, that was mainly an opportunity I had with monies for people like that.
1:04:50
I’ve had some outstanding graduate students.
1:04:52
I haven’t had, personally, hardly any money for post-doc people.
1:04:56
That’s just the way it worked out.
1:05:00
Given the best of all situations, I would probably have liked to have had
1:05:06
a couple of post-doctoral folks, doing some things and following up on some
1:05:11
things that they do on the Andrews.
1:05:13
I might well be a little more formally involved with the Andrews there.
1:05:17
But I haven’t had the financial wherewithal to do, that plus
1:05:21
keep certain students going.
1:05:25
I think some choices in life are a little more opportunistic.
1:05:31
The IBP gave them then leaders of that work here
1:05:40
during the main years I was here, about a million dollars a year.
1:05:44
In 1974, 75, and 76, dollars.
1:05:48
That would be a markup of at least three-fold, today.
1:05:52
So, envision three million dollars today, in today’s money, as guaranteed.
1:05:58
You know, definitely available for foreseeably three to five years,
1:06:04
or whatever it’s going to be.
1:06:06
That was a tremendous window of opportunity.
1:06:12
I would like to see us get, not necessarily me, personally, but
1:06:18
just to continue to create some of that kind of opportunity for the
1:06:21
next generation of researchers.
1:06:23
And it wouldn’t have to necessarily be here.
1:06:27
The LTER infrastructure allowed you some opportunity to do that.
1:06:36
I’m just trying to say that I think that the framework for the opportunity is even
1:06:40
greater than it was when I started here, but it takes a certain amount of funding.
1:06:47
The infrastructure is well funded, but I think it takes a certain
1:06:50
amount of money to fund students and post-docs on top of that.
1:06:55
And keeping the infrastructure going, is quite a bit more expensive
1:06:59
now than it was when first we had no infrastructure to keep going.
1:07:05
And the Forest Service supplied more of that support, they had more money for
1:07:12
supporting that.
1:07:12
Now about the time the IBP dissipated, about the time you started to get
1:07:15
leads on an appointment at OSU, if I’m looking at the time frame here.
1:07:19
Did that have a bearing also on the kinds of research that you began to
1:07:28
do?
1:07:28
Well, Oregon State University has an area of research in forest
1:07:34
productivity and culture and management.
1:07:37
Both of those are relating to management.
1:07:39
So, the kinds of work I did in soil ecosystem studies fit right into that,
1:07:44
so that was a niche that was here.
1:07:48
I did apply for and competed for a position here.
1:07:53
In terms of potential research sites and the kinds of work in Coweeta you
1:07:58
started, as I understand it, your focus diffused out from the Andrews
1:08:02
and you began work in Eastern Oregon.
1:08:06
Well, actually, that came quite a bit later, but I would say
1:08:13
we continued to do some research on the Andrews.
1:08:17
Then, we worked on
1:08:21
the effect of pathogens on the forest ecosystem at Waldo Lake.
1:08:25
That was done in, what, ‘81 through about ‘83?
1:08:29
Then, we had another opportunity in the mid ‘80’s to go on the east side
1:08:33
to look at three big insect outbreaks.
1:08:36
I don’t know how long you’ve been out here yourself, but in the ‘80’s there
1:08:39
were big insect outbreaks in the east side, bark beetles and spruce budworms.
1:08:47
We had a project over there.
1:08:49
Then, toward the end of the ‘80’s, early ‘90’s, I had this fire project.
1:08:53
I
1:08:56
just finished that up.
1:08:57
Actually, we got the last paper out last year.
1:09:01
Then, I started some research on
1:09:05
mycorrihizae in the mid ‘80’s, some of which was at the Andrews,
1:09:08
some of which was nearby Coast Range forests, just because they’re
1:09:11
handy, you know, easy to get to.
1:09:13
In fact, that’s how we would gain some credibility, and
1:09:17
still do, any of these things.
1:09:18
It’s good to have sites that are satellites of the Andrews, so that you
1:09:23
could broaden the applications of those.
1:09:27
As good as the Andrews is, I’ve always felt that you should try to demonstrate
1:09:33
relevance elsewhere, because we’re demonstrating ecosystem principles,
1:09:36
and try to take it outside that.
1:09:41
Other people have gone on, they’re interested in landscape
1:09:45
applications and that sort of thing.
1:09:47
I haven’t gotten into that, but clearly you have to build bridges outward.
1:09:57
Once you
1:10:00
get on a tenure-track appointment at OSU, does it then become easier to
1:10:05
work with graduate students, or are you more willing to take on a graduate
1:10:09
student than you might be otherwise.
1:10:10
Both, because you have the time.
1:10:12
I would have liked to have had students very early, but when you’re a post-doc,
1:10:21
you’re not in a position to be an advisor.
1:10:22
You could help students and work with-them, but you can’t
1:10:24
be a major professor until you get a real faculty position.
1:10:28
So, in that situation you would tend to work more with technicians?
1:10:32
And other fellow post- docs, is what I did.
1:10:37
So, your circle of collaborators would change?
1:10:39
Right, definitely.
1:10:40
Well, and I very much wanted to take what I learned and to help
1:10:46
train a new generation of students.
1:10:49
So, if I was given an opportunity, I’d like to turn around and do it for
1:10:53
as many more as I could in my career.
1:10:55
Sure, sure.
1:10:56
Still doing that, I hope.
1:10:57
[Chuckle] A few more grey hairs.
1:11:03
One
1:11:06
more thing I wanted to ask you though.
1:11:08
Did you get to talk to Jim Sedell today?
1:11:08
Yeah, I did.
1:11:10
I got to this morning.
1:11:11
It was a long haul to get on his calendar.
1:11:14
Get him tied down and disciplined and not fidgeting in his chair?
1:11:17
[Chuckle] He’s a great guy.
1:11:19
Mainly just because he
1:11:20
-- -- Going in a million directions, though.
1:11:22
Yeah.
1:11:23
Just getting in on his schedule was the problem most of the time.
1:11:25
Yeah,
1:11:30
I understand.
1:11:30
Off-the-record, how long have you been involved in this project?
1:11:33
Oh, I’ve been with the Andrews project since ‘96.
1:11:41
But I’ve been working with the PNW Station here on these history
1:11:46
projects since about ’91, actually.
1:11:49
So, you’ve gotten to know the LTER group fairly well.
1:11:52
Fairly good, yeah.
1:11:53
Been down there in the summer and you’ve seen some of what they do.
1:11:56
Yeah.
1:11:56
You have a feeling for what they’re doing now?
1:11:59
Yeah, in general.
1:11:59
I tend to go to most of the meetings when I’m in town here so, yeah.
1:12:03
Okay, alright.
1:12:04
So, you really do know people pretty well.
1:12:05
If you didn’t really know folks like Jerry Franklin and Dick Waring, who weren’t
1:12:10
directly working with it, you should.
1:12:12
Yeah.
1:12:12
They, I only know through interviews I’ve done with them.
1:12:15
You know because they haven’t really been involved with the group
1:12:17
very much since I’ve been here.
1:12:19
People like Ted, who was here at that time, he went off to Alaska for a major
1:12:23
period, but came back as a retired guy helping us put the soil database together.
1:12:27
He started out on it and then we finished.
1:12:29
Yeah.
1:12:29
You know, it’s interesting how they
1:12:32
circle back.
1:12:33
Ted, I’ve really enjoyed working with him, because before I did this, I
1:12:36
was working on the Alaska history.
1:12:38
That’s right, you’ve got two bangs for [him] , right?
1:12:41
He was up there for 15 years.
1:12:43
Okay.
1:12:43
Because I just was curious.
1:12:45
It just helps me to ask you a couple of questions.
1:12:54
I’ve been asking everybody I interviewed just to get a sense of changes over time.
1:12:58
Maybe you could tell me how you might characterize the difference between basic
1:13:01
and applied science, as you understand it.
1:13:05
In forestry, I think it’s more difficult to do, because
1:13:14
you could see the applications
1:13:21
easily.
1:13:21
In other words,
1:13:24
understanding the basis of things like forest productivity or soil
1:13:30
fertility or how mycorrihizae work or
1:13:35
how a log decays.
1:13:37
These are all good, basic science questions, but we urge that we
1:13:40
need to know them because of the tremendous resource use in forestry.
1:13:46
I
1:13:49
don’t see there being real hard and fast lines between those.
1:13:54
That’s what I enjoy about being in forestry.
1:13:56
You can concentrate very hard on those basic science questions, and you
1:14:01
can sit back and turn it around and sort of think about the adaptation.
1:14:05
Maybe, I wouldn’t directly do that, but try to write stuff out,
1:14:09
and try to cast our findings so that others can incorporate that
1:14:19
into management.
1:14:21
Given what you’ve said there, in forestry, is it likely that all
1:14:28
findings will drive the kinds of basic questions that are being asked in
1:14:32
research as kind of a demonstration of the value of the discipline?
1:14:37
I don’t know that it drives it.
1:14:42
Some people might think that that’s true.
1:14:45
But I’ve felt that good research should be somewhat policy-independent.
1:14:51
Because you’re trying to formulate what one would think are important
1:14:55
questions about how an ecosystem might function, might be sustained or managed.
1:15:04
There’s a lot we have to learn about that.
1:15:12
It’s inevitable that policy will come into play, but I would rather see good research
1:15:21
and management guide policy rather than policy simply driving research.
1:15:30
On the other hand, where do you get your directions for ideas and
1:15:36
creativity, and trying really new things?
1:15:42
The public has a lot of interest in managing the resources of the country,
1:15:47
so that translates itself into policy.
1:15:50
That’s why we ended up with things like an EPA, because we were very
1:15:53
concerned about the environment.
1:15:54
So that’s there, but
1:16:00
they’re also kind of expecting people who have had training and research and
1:16:08
education, to come back to them with
1:16:15
a better knowledge base upon which to base management.
1:16:24
I think at a university, we have a chance to interact with policy, but
1:16:28
I don’t feel we should be driven by
1:16:32
it.
1:16:33
We can contribute to it, but it is dialogue.
1:16:38
I don’t think we should just formulate policy either.
1:16:42
We contribute to the ideas of how to formulate policy.
1:16:46
I
1:16:50
think we have to be
1:16:54
careful how we do that so that we don’t try to impose our values, because there
1:16:58
are difficult issues to deal with here.
1:16:59
They’re interesting issues, they’re challenging issues,
1:17:02
but they’re sometimes difficult
1:17:07
issues in relation to the resource base of this planet.
1:17:08
So that puts a lot of responsibility on people to try to handle them in
1:17:12
a responsible manner, so that the
1:17:16
different sides of these questions get explored.
1:17:20
Some are popular and easy, some are not easy, and they may not be popular,
1:17:26
but maybe they’ll be important.
1:17:30
That’s the way I feel about it.
1:17:33
Do you have a sense of the relative success of the Andrews in
1:17:37
particular, in achieving that kind of balance in comparison with other
1:17:41
places like, for example, Coweeta?
1:17:47
I think they have certainly contributed to our knowledge
1:17:52
base of how ecosystems function.
1:17:55
I certainly think that that’s going to have a bearing on future management.
1:18:02
For me, being sort of in the middle of it, it’s a little more difficult to say how
1:18:06
much they’ve really contributed to policy.
1:18:09
They certainly contributed to the national discussions about
1:18:11
ecosystems, ecosystem management.
1:18:14
I think that’s fair to say.
1:18:17
We’re right in the middle of that now, so, it’s an ongoing
1:18:26
conversation.
1:18:27
One other thing here that’s kind of a corollary to what we were talking about
1:18:29
earlier in terms of what you view as your
1:18:34
audience for the work that you do; how successful or consciously do
1:18:42
you think the Andrews group has targeted an audience or audiences?
1:18:48
In other words, how well are they known for what they do?
1:18:51
They’re known, I think in professional audiences, they’re known very well,
1:18:56
nationally and internationally.
1:19:00
I think they’re also known quite well in management circles,
1:19:08
and they certainly have had some impact on policy.
1:19:12
When we talked earlier about this whole, levels of education, I don’t know how
1:19:16
much the general public knows about them.
1:19:20
People in Oregon have certainly heard about them, but I don’t
1:19:24
think somebody in New York has heard about the Andrews or Coweeta
1:19:30
or Hubbard Brook.
1:19:31
It would be an interesting question to ask.
1:19:33
But, nationally, many people,
1:19:39
have heard of ecosystem management.
1:19:39
I think a bit of an educational sort of job still to do there yet.
1:19:43
So, the legacy of ecosystem management has become well-known?
1:19:47
I think so.
1:19:48
But the links between that and what people are doing, and from what I
1:19:52
hear and from what you’re saying, I’m gathering the Andrews has been
1:19:57
a leader in ecosystem management.
1:19:57
Look at
1:20:03
the recent
1:20:06
Mars lander and the tremendous focus that that got all over the world.
1:20:13
I think
1:20:16
the involvement of things like NASA is going to help to educate about
1:20:21
global ecosystems, and integrate up.
1:20:25
So, there are various levels on which this educational process will occur.
1:20:29
I think we need more of it.
1:20:32
I’m not gifted at working with, say, elementary school kids, personally.
1:20:36
But I think people who can do that, need to be trained in some of that
1:20:40
information base, so they can incorporate it, because there’s a lot happening in
1:20:46
science and medicine and everything else.
1:20:49
There’s a lot of information to teach people today.
1:20:54
Our policy-makers, our governmental leaders need education as well.
1:20:57
We don’t have that many scientists in Congress.
1:21:01
Look at the impact on Congress of the astronauts who became Congress-people.
1:21:06
You know that a relative handful were primarily
1:21:13
flight engineers.
1:21:17
They were not even basic researchers, but, as a group, they certainly
1:21:20
have had a big impact in Congress, because of their expertise in science.
1:21:25
That’s just one illustration of what I’m getting at here.
1:21:28
We need more of those kinds
1:21:31
of
1:21:35
people.
1:21:35
I wonder if you could tell me, from your perceptions of having worked with
1:21:39
this group for a while, what would you consider to be the more enduring legacy
1:21:44
of this research group at the Andrews,
1:21:51
from 1971 up to the present?
1:21:53
I think we will have an enduring legacy of a really good foundation level of
1:22:03
coniferous forest ecosystem research.
1:22:10
That includes the
1:22:14
watershed studies, it includes model development, includes
1:22:22
all of the vegetation and plant ecological applications.
1:22:28
It includes physiological ecology that was done, soils work, little
1:22:35
things like coarse woody debris,
1:22:39
the role of the crowns of tall trees, the epiphytes, because we have a
1:22:44
clean atmosphere out here, things like lichens, where some of the
1:22:50
findings canopy research pioneered.
1:22:54
There are many facets to it.
1:22:55
The stream research.
1:22:57
You know there’s erosion research.
1:22:59
You can go back to the major sub-themes of that work, I think are all going to have a
1:23:04
very good legacy, both scientifically and
1:23:10
in policy and management.
1:23:10
Now, we’re
1:23:14
not just at the Andrews but are trying to interact with countries in Eastern Europe
1:23:18
to deal with all the pollution problems in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
1:23:26
I don’t know if you’re going to interview Mark Harmon, but he’s doing a lot of work,
1:23:29
and has done a lot of work in Russia.
1:23:32
Yeah, I did, but I’m trying to remember if we talked about it.
1:23:35
I can’t recall.
1:23:36
Okay.
1:23:36
But that’s an example where it’s going out onto the planet.
1:23:40
Jerry Franklin had some very good ties with Japanese forest ecologists.
1:23:44
Some of them came here during the IBP.
1:23:47
We now have several Japanese graduate students here doing ecosystems research,
1:23:55
and we’ve certainly had very good interactions with China.
1:24:06
Those are just select examples.
1:24:11
The International Biological Program didn’t only occur here; it occurred
1:24:14
in Canada, it occurred in Western Europe, they were counterpart programs.
1:24:19
I think some of those international ones never had quite the funding levels,
1:24:25
duration, or widespread scope we had here, partly because they didn’t have the
1:24:30
money, even in places like Britain, but they did get ecosystem groups together.
1:24:40
Dick Waring’s done a sabbatical there, and he could tell you about that.
1:24:44
So, if you’re looking for how it’s gone out from here, it’s gone out from
1:24:49
here in a lot of very interesting ways.
1:24:51
We had the Swedish ecology team over here, and we had Japanese ecologists.
1:24:54
In other words, all through the years it’s been a very large international contingent
1:24:59
of folks who’ve come through here.
1:25:01
Some of them on sabbatical some of them, short stays, so,
1:25:07
there are a lot of threads.
1:25:08
It will be interesting to figure out, I know some of them, but you’ve
1:25:15
been a little more focused in this discussion with how we interacted with
1:25:18
places like Coweeta and University of Washington, but there’s been
1:25:21
all this international interaction.
1:25:26
And we’re probably sort of starting to have impacts in
1:25:29
Third World countries, too,
1:25:32
‘cause of the issues of reforestation and land degradation
1:25:37
and all those sorts of things.
1:25:39
But, I tell my students that an education in forestry will give them the chance
1:25:44
to not only apply things in U.S. forest management, but they, if they
1:25:49
want to do international work, there’s going to be really good opportunities.
1:25:55
If you have a good, stable economic environment, we don’t have wars going
1:25:59
on.
1:26:00
In other words, if you look at the 20th century, it’s been pretty disrupting.
1:26:05
And, if you’ve got a country like Sweden, you see where you didn’t have two world
1:26:09
wars, you look at the infrastructure.
1:26:10
You go down to Germany, and they have a lot of excellent science and a
1:26:14
lot of things that have been rebuilt after two world wars, but they don’t
1:26:18
have a lot of forest that hasn’t been pretty seriously impacted by it.
1:26:25
Sweden has old growth, some of the old-growth forest left.
1:26:28
You get that sense when you get in Europe, of the different
1:26:32
impacts that have occurred.
1:26:36
It’s something that if you try to look at this internationally, do get to go to
1:26:39
some of these places, as there’s a story you’re going to be interested in seeing.
1:26:47
Sweden’s very environmentally conscious, Germany is becoming more so.
1:26:52
So, what you’re saying is one of the important legacies, is in the people?
1:26:54
Well, you know another country that’s really blossomed, is Spain.
1:26:57
Because Spain after Franco has really trained an outstanding young group
1:27:02
of scientists who are doing excellent things, but are not having nearly the
1:27:07
financing some other countries do.
1:27:09
They’re doing some excellent work.
1:27:14
They care about their ecosystems.
1:27:16
They’ve been doing things since the time of the Romans, so
1:27:21
they’re not exactly pristine.
1:27:25
[Chuckle]
1:27:25
I’m following what you’re saying.
1:27:26
To give you an example, in Spain, the local jurisdiction of grazing
1:27:30
cattle on land have been in business for hundreds and hundreds of years.
1:27:36
And they take precedence over, say a U.S. Forest Service.
1:27:41
It’d be like the county regulations having been in existence for 500 years,
1:27:47
the United States came into being, and now we have the Forest Service.
1:27:50
Guess whose regulations would sort of be the prime for local land management?
1:27:54
It’s reverse to what you’d think of in this country.
1:27:57
So, that makes it challenging for people in Spain to govern.
1:28:01
They are forced to work with local people, and almost first to educate
1:28:04
them in what they’re trying to do.
1:28:06
To deal with local jurisdictions and then bring in the national
1:28:10
system, makes it a little harder.
1:28:15
Something I learned from my Spanish students.
1:28:21
Trying to extrapolate?
1:28:22
I know we’ve progressed, but I just see a lot of ways in which
1:28:26
something like the Andrews and these other ecosystem study groups
1:28:33
are potentially interacting nationally and internationally.
1:28:39
So, what you’re talking about is a model of interdisciplinary exchange that’s been
1:28:43
extrapolated into international arenas.
1:28:44
Right.
1:28:46
People like Dick Waring are developing short courses.
1:28:49
He’s done it in Austria and I think he’s going to go to Eastern Europe
1:28:52
with it, because those students need to be able to catch up with us and not
1:28:59
duplicate all the intermediate steps.
1:29:03
They need to be brought up to speed in terms of computers, methods, and
1:29:09
where we are in our science, so that they can catch up and start doing
1:29:14
work that’s comparable to ours.
1:29:16
They’re going to have to go through some of the same experiences in
1:29:21
terms of developing organizational structure and all that.
1:29:25
You just have to kind of go through some of that, but at the same
1:29:27
time, they shouldn’t have to go back and do all of the 1970’s type
1:29:31
research we did, or the ‘80’s.
1:29:35
Some things, yes, but we should enable them to catch up a lot easier.
1:29:40
They’ve got a huge job to do and in many cases not nearly the funds we had.
1:29:45
All of these countries are still dealing with both the aftermath of wars and real
1:29:50
resource pressures on their forests.
1:29:54
So, they’re challenged.
1:29:57
Well, I probably should let you get back to work.
1:29:59
Phil Sollins is talking just along the same lines about the Canadians
1:30:03
as part of the IBP, and the history of how people have moved from the IBP
1:30:10
into national leadership positions.
1:30:14
Right.
1:30:15
Well, one way to think of it, is Canada’s a huge country, but it’s not a large
1:30:19
population, it’s about like California.
1:30:22
They
1:30:26
did some very nice stuff, but they didn’t have all the funding and all
1:30:33
the groups behind it that we had.
1:30:37
But, we had some very good interaction with
1:30:41
some of the Canadians, some of the British and Canadian specialists.
1:30:44
There’s a doctoral student from the UBC [University of British
1:30:49
Columbia] research scene I’ve been trying to steer in that direction.
1:30:52
Well, one person that you need to talk to [would be Hamish Kimmins]
1:30:55
, because he has been one of the outstanding ecosystem research.
1:31:03
He’s written a major textbook on forest ecology.
1:31:06
He’s been working on forest ecosystem models for nearly 20 years now.
1:31:15
He’s a Yale-trained ecologist.
1:31:20
In fact, Dan Binkley, who’s my student, did a masters with him
1:31:23
and then came down to work with me.
1:31:29
But there are people like that that would be well worth talking
1:31:32
to sometime or knowing about.
1:31:37
I shouldn’t take up all of your afternoon here.
1:31:39
You’ve been generous enough, but I’ve got to get my daughter from daycare, too.
1:31:42
Did you have anything that you wanted to zero in on, because I
1:31:46
kind of actually jumped around?
1:31:46
Well, I appreciate the opportunity to try to provide you, hopefully, some
1:31:52
useful information about my experience.
1:31:54
It was very positive for me, all the way.
1:31:58
Yeah, good.
1:31:59
Well, it’s been helpful.
1:32:00
I feel I could have done more, sometimes, with maybe more resources,
1:32:04
post-IBP, but I’ve been very blessed to get a lot of good things done.
1:32:09
Now Phil’s done some really nice work in the tropics, too.
1:32:14
I don’t know if he’s brought that out, but he’s done a lot of work in Costa Rica.
1:32:17
Yeah, we talked about that, a little bit of the transition.
1:32:19
He had originally lived down there in Puerto Rico and moved, I think, during
1:32:23
his high school years or something.
1:32:25
You already had that, that he had several interesting projects down there.
1:32:31
He’s gone out
1:32:53
and done some nice stuff for
1:33:17
the classes.
1:33:18
Well I better-
1:33:18
Gotta
1:33:47
go.
