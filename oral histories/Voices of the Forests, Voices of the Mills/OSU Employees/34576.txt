00:15
[tape begins in mid-sentence]….
00:15
latitude in, what type of research project to start.
00:19
It needed to be something in the Andrews, and something that helped
00:24
understand stream ecosystems, something that wasn’t already being done.
00:30
So, I thought about it, and my background was particularly working with fish,
00:37
but there was a grad student starting a project at that time on fish, so we
00:42
decided to try to spread things out and diversify, so I ended up working on
00:46
primary production in the stream, which is the food base for the stream ecosystem.
00:53
My thesis was looking at a clear-cut section and an old-growth section of
00:57
Mack Creek up in the Andrews, and looking at the primary production rates and
01:04
nutrient dynamics associated with that.
01:10
IBP was a great
01:15
learning experience because it was one of the first truly
01:21
multi-disciplinary ecosystem programs.
01:29
We had people like Jim Sedell and Jim Hall and Jerry Franklin and Dick
01:34
Waring and Kermit Cromack, and lots of other people to learn from, and
01:39
the program was constantly getting together and exchanging ideas and
01:45
concepts about how ecosystems function.
01:48
So, I learned a lot about a lot of different ecosystem components instead
01:52
of just learning a lot about streams.
01:54
Had that been a focus in your undergraduate work at Tennessee?
01:57
Yeah,
02:01
by the time I’d finished up my undergraduate work, I wanted to go
02:04
into ichthyology, the systematics and the taxonomy of fish, but there
02:08
weren’t many jobs, and so I decided that was a pretty stupid thing to do.
02:13
I thought, fisheries ecology or fisheries biology had more job
02:19
opportunities, so I would go into that.
02:23
But
02:25
actually, when I first arrived, I was looking at the role of fish
02:28
carcasses on stream productivity.
02:32
I decided for some logistical reasons that weren’t really tying
02:37
in well to the IBP project, at least the way I saw it at the time.
02:41
There were some logistic problems in terms of doing nutrient cycling work but
02:46
I couldn’t really look at productivity, because we didn’t have as many carcasses
02:50
coming back as historically came back.
02:52
So, I shifted to the primary production study, because it
02:54
was needed in the project.
02:58
I was kind of filling need as opposed to sticking with my background.
03:02
Did somebody advise you in that?
03:07
Yeah, it was a discussion with Jim Sedell, Jack Donaldson, and
03:11
Jim Hall; we all kicked it around.
03:15
But none of them had expertise in primary production.
03:19
Luckily, Dave McIntire was on campus at the time, and Dave
03:25
was developing a stream ecosystem model for IBP.
03:29
And he was one of the pioneers in primary production work in streams.
03:35
What program was he in?
03:36
IBP.
03:36
[International Biological Programme, Coniferous Forest Biome]
03:37
But on campus?
03:38
In Botany.
03:45
At Tennessee, were any intellectual mentors or people that you
03:52
worked with?
03:52
Dave Etnier, E-t-n-i-e-r.
03:55
He’s the fella who did most of the original work on the snail
03:58
darter back there in Tennessee.
04:04
He’s a taxonomist, but he was also one of these people with diverse background.
04:09
He came out studying dynamics of sunfish populations, and he was
04:18
also a great fish systematist.
04:21
He’s written a book I’ve got it at home right now; Fishes of Tennessee.
04:25
That’s just a beautiful text with color plates of all
04:30
the fishes of Tennessee, so it’s a monumental work.
04:33
He was going to be publishing it about two to three years after I left
04:37
in’71, but it just came out last year.
04:44
He was also a good aquatic entomologist.
04:46
He was great for an undergraduate to be around; he taught me a lot.
04:55
He liked to go out collecting fish, and so it seemed like every other weekend he was
05:00
taking us out and we were collecting from some different stream in the Southeast.
05:05
I got to see lots of streams and learn a lot about fish in my undergraduate work.
05:10
Had you started out at University of Tennessee interested in fish?
05:14
Yeah.
05:14
When
05:17
I was in high school, I thought I wanted to go into
05:20
medicine, wanted to be a doctor.
05:21
Then I
05:25
went to a National Science Foundation-sponsored school for
05:27
marine biology down in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, the summer between my
05:33
junior and senior year in high school.
05:35
So, I decided marine biology was pretty cool and that I was interested
05:43
in that, but I was working my way through school, so I couldn’t
05:46
afford to go to a coastal school.
05:48
So, I decided to go to UT at least for a few years, and perhaps transfer
05:53
into the marine biology program.
05:54
But, while at UT, I got bitten by freshwater systems, and decided that
06:02
they were my real love, so I got into streams and freshwater work
06:09
and decided that was just great.
06:12
The Ocean Springs program is run by the school system in Tennessee?
06:17
No.
06:17
Ocean Springs, Mississippi, is run by the National Science Foundation.
06:20
It was part of their high school student and high school teacher
06:25
education programs that they still run.
06:31
It was great.
06:32
It was a summer, about eight-week course, at a field lab for a lot of
06:42
southeastern universities, as they all use this one laboratory facility
06:46
at Ocean Springs on the Gulf Coast.
06:52
So, we spent eight weeks exploring the Mississippi Sound
06:56
area and making collections.
07:01
We had a lab with aquaria all over the place, and just kind
07:05
of constantly dumping aquaria.
07:07
Anything we got in the field we’d dump it in the aquarium.
07:10
We were staying at a 4-H club camp across from the lab, across the bay, so
07:14
our transportation was via these boats.
07:17
We were just a bunch of high school kids with boats and nets
07:20
and things let loose for summer.
07:22
That sounds fun.
07:23
It was.
07:23
It was a blast.
07:27
It was roughly split, I forget what the split was, but slightly
07:31
more boys than girls, also our hormones throbbing and everything
07:36
[chuckle], so it was a great summer.
07:39
Mixing as well as learning about biology and geology of that area.
07:44
So, I really enjoyed it.
07:46
Learned a lot.
07:47
So,
07:53
you shifted your interest from pre-med then to fisheries at that point?
07:57
Yeah.
08:03
Looking back on
08:07
it, multi-disciplinary programs have always fascinated me, or people who can
08:13
understand a lot about different kinds of systems, are very diverse in their
08:18
own interests and backgrounds, and who don’t just narrow on one specialty.
08:23
Must be
08:25
some character flaw or something, that I’ve always been attracted to that.
08:30
This NSF program exposed us to a lot of geology and water chemistry and hydrology,
08:38
and then also to a lot of biology.
08:40
The majority of it was biology.
08:43
Then coming in working with Dave, who was that kind of person who was into
08:51
many different fields of zoology, and then moving from there and landing
08:56
in IBP, which was just a buffet of these people that knew something about
09:03
forest and stream ecosystems, and we were tied into the Seattle arm of IBP.
09:12
They were working on lakes up there, so it gave us a chance to talk to people
09:17
like Bob Wissmar about lake systems.
09:21
From a multi-disciplinary point-of-view, it was great.
09:27
OSU has always been blessed with a
09:32
diversity of ecologists, and a lot of aquatic ecologists as well.
09:37
We’ve been fortunate; it just kind of happened.
09:44
For some reason or other, and I still don’t quite understand
09:47
it, I think it’s a serendipity.
09:48
OSU has a faculty that puts a fairly high premium on working
09:52
together and interacting.
09:57
And most of the multi-disciplinary activities happening across campus,
10:02
and inter-departmental, inter-college,
10:08
are happening because people just want to do it, not because OSU says we will become
10:13
a leader in multi-disciplinary studies.
10:15
I don’t think it was ever programatically deemed the goal by any entity.
10:22
It was just that people that were here enjoyed doing that and saw
10:26
that they gained a lot from it.
10:28
Was it always like that when you got here?
10:30
Yeah.
10:33
As a matter-of-fact, I think one of the greatest risks to it at this
10:36
campus, and just about any other campus I’ve seen, I’ve come to
10:40
realize, is if you formalize it.
10:42
If you start building a center, if you have meetings of the multi-disciplinary
10:48
ecosystems, da, da, da, da, the more you formalize it, the more you kill it.
10:53
That’s one of the reasons we have these gatherings, we call them the
10:56
“Monday Morning Meetings,” that started because the stream types
11:05
needed to coordinate on just who’s going out to the field
11:07
and who’s going to do what.
11:08
So, we’d just get together every Monday morning and make sure we didn’t
11:14
have a lack of coordination.
11:16
Then we started having the grad students present their research projects, and
11:20
people trying out papers that they were going to giving at meetings.
11:23
Then we felt, suddenly, those presentations starting taking
11:27
over the meeting, and we started having them every Monday morning.
11:30
It was a different kind of presentation, and we still have them.
11:33
They started back in the early 70’s, 72’-73’, and they’re still ongoing.
11:44
We get people from all over Oregon, all over campus for sure, to
11:50
come in and give informal talks.
11:53
Some of them are well-polished, and others are just grad student research plans and
11:59
we trying to give them some feedback.
12:01
Very
12:03
laid back and easygoing, but we always have about 25 to as many as 50
12:08
people show up from all over campus.
12:12
There would be civil engineers, forest engineering, EPA people, ODFW researchers,
12:20
grad students, botany; just a real mix.
12:24
One of the cool things about it is the attendance shifts.
12:31
I think one of the reasons the attendance and the interest stay
12:34
high is that no one has to be there.
12:36
You’re not required to attend, it’s not formal, it’s not a class.
12:41
If it’s of interest to you and you get something out of it, you
12:43
come; if you don’t, you don’t.
12:45
No one says, “You haven’t been here. You’ve missed three meetings!”
12:51
I think that’s been a really good part of it. To some degree I think that’s
12:55
why the LTER meetings also work.
12:59
They’re not closed, they’re not forced.
13:02
If you really want to stay hooked into the LTER program, it’s best to show
13:06
up, so that way you don’t lose track.
13:09
If
13:11
you start feeling like you need to touch bases with people, you
13:15
know at least once a month, you’re ‘gonna get a chance to connect.
13:20
It’s still not a
13:24
formal meeting where you just have to be there.
13:27
But these Monday morning meetings have been going since the early 70’s and
13:31
they’re kind of institutionalized now.
13:33
People expect that they’ll be there each week, and they follow
13:36
it to see what’s going on?
13:37
Right.
13:39
They’ve become part of our daily lives,
13:46
but it’s still very informal.
13:47
As a matter-of-fact, the department head and grad students approached
13:50
me about setting it up as a seminar series they could get credit for.
13:57
I decided not to because I didn’t want students to start signing
14:03
up for it, expecting a class.
14:05
You don’t have expectations.
14:06
I wanted it to be open, so no one had expectations.
14:09
It could be anything it wanted to be.
14:16
The other thing is that any program has a certain amount of inherent
14:21
power in it, whatever you’re doing,
14:26
and that can threaten other programs that are trying to do something
14:31
and they see it as competition.
14:33
Our department has a formal seminar series as several departments do.
14:37
I didn’t want ours to be viewed as competition for other seminar series.
14:43
It was just here to be taken advantage of, but not formalized.
14:46
It plays an administrative role, too, coordinating field
14:50
activities and things like that?
14:52
Actually we’ve lost that side of it to be honest, because the presentation
14:55
side has kind of taken over.
14:57
But we know that on Monday we will run into people.
15:01
So that if you’ve got to coordinate, it’s still a good time.
15:05
We’ve stuck to the Monday morning meeting time because it helps if you’ve
15:09
got to get things coordinated for the week, you can still do it on the side.
15:15
But we don’t have time that says, “Okay, who’s going to the mountains, and who’s
15:18
leaving at what time, and this is what we’re gathering if you need it,” the
15:22
way we used to take care of all the field and logistics sides of things.
15:28
Now, we just assume that people will take care of that on their own.
15:37
As
15:49
I understand it, you were at basically two universities in your undergraduate
15:53
and graduate period, Tennessee and OSU.
15:55
Is that right?
15:55
Right.
15:57
Can you talk to me a little bit about the differences about those
15:59
two institutions in terms of this multi-disciplinary experience?
16:05
Well, I was an undergraduate, and undergraduates experience universities
16:08
differently than graduate students
16:13
do.
16:13
As an undergraduate, you’re pretty much taking classes and under the
16:19
pressure of completing your degree and taking all these classes.
16:24
Luckily, I was fortunate that Dave let
16:32
me work in his lab.
16:33
I essentially volunteered in his labs for three years,
16:35
working about 20 hours a week.
16:38
That actually had me playing around with grad students more than most
16:42
undergraduates get to, and going to all the grad seminars, and hanging out at the
16:46
bars with the profs and the grad students.
16:50
It was multi-disciplinary in a more restricted sense than the IBP program was.
16:55
The IBP program was looking at both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
17:03
The multi-disciplinary aspect at UT was probably fortunate for me at the time.
17:09
It was more like
17:12
aquatic organisms, and was multi-disciplinary in terms of
17:16
micro-invertebrates, fish, systematics mycology, ecology, and lakes.
17:22
There was a limnologist there, Dewey Bunton, who had a major
17:26
lake program, so there was all this zooplankton, lake fisheries,
17:29
and lake chemistry work underway.
17:31
So, it was aquatic and multi-disciplinary, and what I got here was a blend
17:35
of aquatic and terrestrial.
17:37
You
17:41
attribute that to the IBP program then?
17:45
Right.
17:45
As an undergraduate, had you heard about the IBP program?
17:50
Yeah, I’d heard about it because Oak Ridge [National Lab] was in the IBP program,
17:54
and that was part of UT, so I knew of it.
17:57
I’d gone to some seminars and heard about some of the work that they were doing.
18:06
I knew of it, even when I was an undergraduate.
18:09
I was very naive and didn’t really understand the full programmatic
18:14
scope of the IBP program.
18:16
I just knew it was a bunch of ecologists
18:21
trying to make sense of different regions, and that’s about it.
18:25
Back there they had hooked into
18:30
that?
18:30
Yeah.
18:30
Not trying to lead you into this, but we had a really great
18:34
group when I first arrived here.
18:36
I was fortunate as a graduate student because in
18:41
the aquatic side here we had Jack Donaldson, who went on to become
18:48
the Director of Oregon Department of Fisheries and Wildlife.
18:59
He actually left the university to start his own aquaculture group on the coast,
19:06
Oraqua.
19:06
I think Weyerhaeuser
19:10
eventually bought them out,
19:14
and then tried an aquaculture program in Springfield at their plant.
19:20
I think it finally faded away.
19:23
With declining salmon returns, it just wasn’t economically viable.
19:27
But Jack was kind of the leader of the bulk of the aquaculture
19:34
attempts in Oregon, and he was here.
19:39
Jim Hall was kind of a guru of watershed studies for fisheries.
19:45
He had been the leader of the Alsea Watershed Program over on the coast,
19:51
the first watershed level study of fisheries’ responses to land use.
20:00
He was really kind of the anchor of the whole aquatic program and IBP here.
20:05
He
20:08
became my major professor after Jack left, a great major professor.
20:12
Jim Sedell was a young post-doc on the program and there’s no
20:19
one that can match Jim for ideas.
20:22
He’s just constantly spinning off ideas.
20:27
Then Dave McIntire, one of the pioneers in primary production work in streams.
20:34
Jack Lyford, who was in [OSU’s Department of] General Science at the
20:38
time; they’ve now been merged over into Botany and Biology and Zoology.
20:46
He taught courses in bio-geography, and he’s probably the closest I’ve run into
20:53
in my career as a natural historian.
20:56
He was equally adept at identifying an alga and identifying
21:05
a tree; his botany was tremendous, identifying a mammal, any organism.
21:15
He could start telling you about its range and distribution, its
21:18
ecology and evolutionary history.
21:21
He was fascinating to be around.
21:24
Taught me an awful lot.
21:25
That’s Jack Lyford?
21:26
Jack Lyford.
21:27
Then Frank Triska came on as a post-doc in the program in about ’74.
21:34
I think, something like that.
21:37
Triska?
21:37
T-r-i-s-k-a.
21:40
And Norm Anderson.
21:42
Norm was quite an entomologist here in the program, and
21:51
one of the regional authorities on macro invertebrates and streams and
21:55
has trained most of the people in the region now that are the experts
22:01
on systematics of aquatic insects.
22:03
So,
22:06
they were just really great people to be with, very supportive of me as
22:10
a student, gave me lots of latitude in terms of what I wanted to study.
22:15
The good thing about the IBP program was these people.
22:20
If you could make a case that what you were approaching was sound
22:25
and well-reasoned, they would give you the latitude to do it.
22:29
It was a very open environment as opposed to a very controlled one; stepping
22:35
through the classes, drawing some tables and graphs, get in and get out of here.
22:45
Anyway,
22:47
those people I just mentioned all had their own different areas of expertise.
22:55
But, as a collective whole, they really developed a nice perspective
22:58
on stream ecosystems and trying to figure out how stream ecosystems work.
23:03
One thing I really smile about and enjoy, and I’ve teased Jerry about
23:10
this for years, is that one of the things that emerged out of the
23:16
program here was the recognition of the role of large wood in ecosystems.
23:21
I think in general, except for Burchard Heede’s work in
23:29
the Fremont National Forest in Colorado, this
23:37
was the first place that ecologists started recognizing
23:41
the importance of large wood.
23:44
That has led to the management changes we see now in the management
23:46
of large wood in forest ecosystems.
23:49
The cool thing about it was
23:52
that it came out of the stream program.
23:57
Well indirectly, it came out of logging, and then out of the stream program.
24:02
Hank Froehlich was a veteran forest engineer [at OSU] , and he was looking
24:08
at debris flows and landslides,
24:12
and one of the things that was being attributed to causing debris flows and
24:17
landslides was a lot of slash, logging slash, left on the hillsides or in a
24:22
stream after an [logging] operation.
24:25
So, it ponded up the water and would cause this mass failure.
24:30
So, he started doing measurements of how much logging slash was
24:34
actually being left out there.
24:37
He developed some censusing techniques for measuring how much wood was there.
24:43
In doing so, he kind of needed to differentiate how much came
24:48
in during the logging operation, and how much was there before.
24:53
While he was doing this, Jim Sedell kind of looked over his shoulder and started
25:00
saying, “Hey, there’s a lot of wood there.” In the IBP program we were looking
25:03
at carbon stores and carbon cycles.
25:07
So,
25:10
Jim started asking him if it would be possible to use his approaches to
25:15
measure how much wood was present, and Hank came out to the Andrews and showed
25:21
us how to use his survey techniques.
25:25
We started applying this to streams and found there was a huge
25:28
amount of wood in the streams.
25:40
We brought it up at a few meetings, and people started saying, “Oh, that’s an
25:44
anomaly, that’s just the Andrews, or that’s just the Northwest.” So, we started
25:49
going to streams around the country.
25:53
We went back to the Smokies, and we went up to Heart’s Content, Pennsylvania, and
25:56
a few other places, and measured [wood in the streams] . Any place there was
25:59
an old forest we found a lot of wood, and any place that there was not an old
26:03
forest, the wood amounts were about 10% of what there were in forested areas.
26:11
The thing that was cool about it is that as soon as we started talking about all
26:13
the wood in creeks, some of the forest types, like Franklin and others, started
26:18
saying, “Hey, we’ve got a lot of wood on the forest floor too.” So they started
26:23
measuring wood on the forest floor.
26:25
I
27:01
always like the fact that a lot of the wood story came
27:04
out of the creeks at first.
27:06
That’s interesting.
27:07
Maybe you could talk about
27:13
this nucleus of intelligence at OSU that you found yourself in the middle of and
27:17
how you got this focus at Mack Creek.
27:20
You said it was about the time IBP ended,
27:26
if I remember.
27:26
Was there a shift in your focus because of that?
27:29
Yeah, kind of.
27:31
Actually, right about the time IBP ended, there was another
27:36
major aquatic program that emerged that had international impact.
27:42
I
27:44
was part of it, but not directly.
27:49
It was kind of interesting.
27:50
The River Continuum Project was from an NSF
27:56
grant that Jim Sedell was the PI on, from here.
28:02
It was with Wayne Minshall at Idaho State working with the Salmon River, Ken
28:07
Cummins at Kellogg Biological Station working in the Kalamazoo River Basin
28:14
[Michigan] , and Robin Vannote working in the Brandywine system in Pennsylvania.
28:20
They came up with this idea about rivers being a continuum,
28:23
from headwaters to large rivers.
28:25
So,
28:28
right about 1975-’76, when I was finishing my doctoral research,
28:35
that program was just coming
28:39
on.
28:40
I helped them get started and attended several of the early
28:45
workshops, and helped them develop their primary production system.
28:50
I built all the chambers they used across the country, and actually,
28:54
they ended up using my techniques for measuring primary production
28:58
at all the river continuum sites.
29:00
I went out when they first got started,
29:05
and spent the first half-year working with their field crew getting them
29:09
going in the field, and trying to finish up my degree at the same time.
29:19
They brought in at that time, Bob Naiman, as a post-doc for the River Continuum
29:23
Project, and Dale McCullough and Chuck Hawkins, as research assistants.
29:33
So, they kicked into another major phase in the aquatic program here.
29:40
Naiman was here several years, went on to another position, and ended
29:45
up at the University of Washington.
29:48
Chuck and Dale both got degrees here after they finished up as research assistants.
29:52
Chuck is a professor at Utah State, and Dale is a leader at the Columbia
29:58
River Intertribal Council, and
30:03
so we grew up together.
30:11
Right around ’77, when I was trying to get ready to defend my thesis,
30:16
I took a job with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service out
30:20
of Columbia, Missouri, but was stationed here in Corvallis.
30:25
It was a field station, and the national fisheries research lab was in Columbia.
30:31
I was supposed to be looking at contaminant-related issues in
30:35
the Northwest forests for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
30:41
I worked for them for
30:47
almost four years, and decided that I didn’t like some of the constraints
30:54
in the federal system, and wanted to come back to the university.
30:57
So, I got a post-doc with Ken Cummins, who had come here in the aquatic program.
31:03
Jim Sedell left and went to Weyerhaeuser, and Ken Cummins
31:08
took his place here at OSU.
31:12
So I came back to be a post-doc with the stream program again.
31:21
What were some of the concerns about Fish and Wildlife Service
31:28
work?
31:28
The lab itself had always been into toxic substances in the environment,
31:33
and their impact on fisheries.
31:34
They were trying to broaden their perspective into ecosystem-related
31:38
processes and sedimentation.
31:41
But, they wanted a field person in the Northwest, so that when they had
31:45
an issue, they could deal with it effectively, whichever end it started on.
31:50
I was suddenly running streams in Idaho, Washington, California, and Oregon.
31:56
So, I got to know the Northwest well over that three or four-year period, and that
32:00
was before I had kids, so I could spend the time on the road and not suffer.
32:05
That sounds like a crisis response kind of approach?
32:11
No, the Fish and Wildlife Service had their own regional crisis approach.
32:15
This was more from a research point-of-view, what are emerging
32:19
contaminant issues, kind of getting on the leading edge of them,
32:21
and deciding what the lab should do about them, and to advise.
32:24
Okay.
32:31
When I first took the job, it was one of these things where, it was going
32:35
to be a big program, they were getting us on the ground for six months, and
32:38
then there was going to be an assistant leader and students coming, and there
32:43
was going to be a major research lab at each of these places around the country.
32:48
And then Congress cut the funds, so it became us, that was it,
32:55
and no other funding beyond that.
32:57
We ended up being more advisory than doing the research part.
33:03
It was one of those things that had great plans to start with but never developed.
33:09
They still have them, and they have been able to get funding into them, but when
33:15
I resigned here, they decided not to replace me and use the funds to help some
33:20
of the other labs around the country.
33:22
So, the closest one to here I think is in Davis.
33:24
It sounds
33:28
like an interest in getting back into research, kind of drew you back here?
33:31
Yeah, particularly academic research.
33:35
They were still promising us that just around the corner, they were
33:40
going to get the funds and we’d be able to do field research.
33:44
We were able to dabble in little projects.
33:47
We just didn’t get enough funding to really make it work.
33:51
I think it could have worked, but I got tired.
33:57
I remember going back for training programs, and they had some
34:00
different perspectives than I did.
34:02
I remember the lab director telling us that, in running government
34:06
contracts, we had to go to a workshop on how to be a project officer.
34:08
And he said, “Okay, first of all, if you can possibly do it, do a cooperative
34:15
agreement within some exchange or program within the Fish and Wildlife Service.
34:20
Failing that, do an intergovernmental agreement between the Federal
34:25
government, failing that, with state governments, failing that, go to a
34:29
temp firm, and last and very least, go to a university.” “Why?” I asked,
34:33
and he said, “Well, they’re mavericks, they never give you your product,
34:36
and they always give you something else that you weren’t looking for.”
34:42
Then, they would get me back there like once every six months, and we would
34:48
have this research planning meeting, and they would get people in from D.C., even
34:52
congressional staff and things like that.
34:55
I’d get back there and they would always get us in for a day or two, and they
34:58
said “no” and go out to dinner with these people, sit and talk them at the meetings,
35:03
but really pump them to see what kind of research Washington wants to support.
35:07
After a couple of years, I said, “Wait a minute, this is back-asswards.
35:12
We’re the researchers, we’re the scientists.
35:12
We should be telling Washington what
35:15
research needs to be done!
35:16
This thing of, “We’ll hear what Washington wants to fund, is crazy!”
35:21
And they said, “Hey, it may be crazy, but it’s the only you stay alive in
35:24
this business.” That there’s certain things that are gonna be dead on
35:27
arrival, even if it’s the best research.
35:30
So, we have to know what they’re receptive to, and then take what we think is good
35:34
research, and try to blend it with what is politically acceptable, or where emerging
35:39
programs are occurring.” I said, “That sucks.” There were a couple of research
35:45
projects I wanted to push on, and they said, “Well that’s a good idea, but it
35:49
just doesn’t fit programmatically.” I talked to the lab director, lab leaders,
35:55
program leaders and staff, and they said, “Gregory, what you gotta do is figure out
35:59
what you want to do, bootleg it within your research program, and you kinda
36:03
find a way to nest it so that they never see it.” Within a year after I left,
36:09
two of the program leaders got their wrists slapped for doing just that, and
36:15
had their own interests pulled away from them, and were told they couldn’t do it.
36:21
I remember chuckling and thinking, “I told you guys that wasn’t anyway to
36:25
run a research program!” Universities are better for people that don’t like
36:31
those kinds of programmatic constraints.
36:34
It’s much dicier in universities because you never know when you’re going to
36:38
have support and when you aren’t, but you can do anything you want as long
36:42
as you can convince someone that it’s sound and that they will fund it.
36:47
That’s great for people who like that kind of openness, but the
36:51
risk and pressure of getting the dollars at universities are great.
36:57
If you like more
37:00
continuity and guaranteed funding, but with less freedom on research ideas
37:08
that you pursue, then I think federal or government research is better.
37:14
The PNW people here like Swanson and others, have been able to have a blend,
37:19
because of NSF connections few federal researchers have the luxury of possessing.
37:26
You came out of [US] Fish and Wildlife and landed here as a post-doc
37:30
right in the middle of the EER, and the beginning of LTER was kind of
37:30
based on interagency cooperation.
37:30
Maybe you could talk a little
37:36
bit about that, or your perception of the differences there, and why it works here.
37:44
I think we’ve been fortunate.
37:46
I’m not sure why it occurred, but back even in the IBP days, they made a
37:52
conscious decision, probably Waring and Franklin had the wisdom, I guess, that
37:57
there needed to be both a university and a Forest Service presence in the
38:03
leadership of the Andrews Program
38:08
and IBP.
38:09
It was interesting because Waring and Franklin were both very strong
38:12
personalities, and both brilliant in my opinion, but diametrically opposed
38:18
in their approach to the world.
38:21
And that caused conflict.
38:24
It was one of those kinds of dynamic tensions.
38:26
It was one that, I think served the program for many years,
38:29
but at times took its toll.
38:32
Because, Dick was an experimentalist,
38:41
and Jerry was more of a large-scale
38:46
observationalist.
38:47
Quite often, the large descriptive studies of pattern and things that
38:50
Jerry wanted, Dick just couldn’t stand, because experimentally it was weak.
38:57
So, the early program was infused with both.
39:01
I think the large-scale patterns give you a context for the experimental
39:07
approach, so while you can balance the two, I think they were great.
39:12
But it does cause tension, and while you have limited resources and someone’s
39:15
‘gotta lose, it can cause hard feelings.
39:22
With that, Franklin was the Forest Service presence and Waring was the OSU presence.
39:29
Then, when Franklin kind of took the lead in the LTER days,
39:37
we tried to make the shift with EER
39:42
and LTER, with it still being joint.
39:44
But, there was a point at which Dick was no longer comfortable with the split,
39:53
and he kind of said, “It’s either going to be strongly experimental, or I’m
39:57
backing out of the leadership role.” So,
40:02
he backed out of the major leadership role, was still a presence, but decided
40:07
to pursue his experimental approaches, and has done quite well doing so, obviously.
40:16
At that time it was moving into the
40:21
early stages of the LTER, or the pre- to early stages of the LTER,
40:22
right around the early 1980’s.
40:28
Franklin
40:30
carried the weight there, and helped get the LTER program on its feet.
40:41
Then, when Jerry left to go to University of Washington, Fred [Swanson] took over.
40:46
The university side has always been present though it wasn’t as
40:53
visible as the two-headed monster that we had in the IBP days.
41:01
It’s mainly because Fred watches out for OSU concerns and we watch
41:09
out for Forest Service concerns,
41:12
and so I think in the people in the research program there has been a
41:16
great respect for the strength that each group brings to the table, no
41:26
one wanting to do anything that would jeopardize either the university’s
41:31
involvement or the PNW involvement.
41:36
Our regional relevance is largely because of the Forest Service link.
41:42
But
41:47
our academic rigor and empirical science comes heavily from the
41:54
university, or at least has that credibility in the public eye, whether
42:01
reality or not.
42:03
Because you can have experimentalists oversee the site just as easily
42:07
as you can here, and you can have
42:10
the more descriptive studies in the university side, too.
42:15
But the public perceives there to be a difference; that universities are pinheads
42:20
and the agencies are all application.
42:23
So, if that’s the way they perceive it, great.
42:24
They’ll see we’re doing basic science, but applying it, and we’ll kind of take
42:30
advantage of their attitudes, their perception, and watch out for each other.
42:38
To be real straight, I doubt if it’s part of your historical accounting
42:41
here, but we’re in a phase that’s isn’t history right now, it’s current events.
42:47
The PNW doesn’t know what the shit it’s doing.
42:53
[Chuckle] Somehow, within the PNW research program there are people that are starting
42:58
to question contractual arrangements, and a lot of the financial arrangements
43:00
came through co-op agreements between the university and the Forest Service.
43:03
I don’t even understand where it’s coming from.
43:17
Those are being questioned now, and even being said that, they’re inappropriate.
43:23
The Forest Service is putting all these restraints or constraints
43:28
on those co-operative agreements.
43:32
With the attitude, someone up in the PNW thinks that all of these co-op
43:36
agreements are just ways for the university scientists to get rich.
43:40
Well, to be honest, almost all the co-operative agreements we’ve run have
43:45
simply been for people like Jim Sedell and Fred and such to get projects done.
43:51
Sometimes we don’t even get anything out of it, it’s just
43:53
that we’re hiring people for their crews, to get their projects done.
43:57
But there’s been this perceptions that somehow these funds are being misused.
44:02
And it’s doubly bad because the university, these are U.S.D.A.
44:08
projects, and the university doesn’t get any indirect costs or overhead for
44:13
running the accounting and everything.
44:16
But yet, they’re starting to require very detailed accounting and the university is
44:21
not getting paid for it, so it’s having to hire a full-time person just to take care
44:27
of these co-op agreements and not getting any money for it, at a time when the
44:31
university is hurting because of Measure 5 [state ballot measure limiting taxes,
44:33
hence state funding] , this kind of stuff.
44:35
Even Fred was being questioned as to whether his being PI on the LTER
44:40
program was a conflict of interest, that as a Forest Service scientist
44:43
he should not be in that position.
44:45
So, the last two years have been very troubling for me.
44:50
What has always been very good teamwork between PNW and OSU, suddenly, there’s
44:55
this glitch, and I hope it just passes.
44:57
I know that Fred and Jim have had to spend enormous amounts of time dealing
45:04
with policy level questions with the PNW, but I hope it doesn’t start affecting the
45:08
history of where we go on the Andrews.
45:11
I think eventually they’re going to have a tough time, because the
45:14
National Science Foundation brings a lot of weight and credibility to
45:18
the university link with the Forest Service, or even larger scale memoranda
45:24
of understanding about NSF and Forest Service working together in research.
45:28
If PNW subverts that, it seems like it’s not going to go over
45:32
too well at a national level.
45:35
You’d mentioned earlier, kind of in passing that, there’s virtue in a loose
45:40
organization, and lack of formality.
45:41
Dick Waring and Jerry Franklin talked about that, too.
45:46
Sounds like what you’re saying here is that there’s more of
45:48
the focus now on these formal agreements and what the details are?
45:52
Not from anything we’re doing, and only slightly from OSU.
45:58
OSU, because of the budget cuts, has gotten more persnickety about things.
46:03
Particularly in response to this move that emerged out of the PNW, we can’t
46:07
even trace its roots back to Washington.
46:09
It’s something that came out of the PNW that’s a contractual kind of thing.
46:14
None of the scientists want it.
46:17
It’s nothing that anyone here is supporting.
46:20
It’s just something that everyone has to pay attention to.
46:26
People have been hesitant to make much of it, and I’ve been uneasy because I’m
46:32
willing from the university side to keep quiet, and not challenge the PNW on it.
46:37
Because of working together, the partnership has been so important,
46:42
I don’t want them to think that we’re suddenly badmouthing them.
46:46
At the same time, there’s a point at which we have to stand up and say, “Hey,
46:50
we’ve spent all this time and emotion trying to deal with these hurdles
46:55
that are being placed in the way.
46:57
And from what we can tell, they’re only be placed there out of some ill-defined
47:05
interest in the PNW, and they’re getting in the way of the research.”
47:09
And so, trying to decide when to finally make an ass of myself and jump up and
47:15
down, or do that with the university,
47:19
where I’ve had openings I’ve tried to get across some subtle messages, but this
47:23
isn’t constructive, and I’ve been able to at least talk to Fred’s supervisor
47:30
and say, Hermann Gucinski is immediate supervisor, and say, “What’s going
47:35
on here Herman? This is crazy?” and Herman is struggling with it himself.
47:42
I think the
47:47
kind of self-regulated, co-operative nature of the team of people that
47:54
work on the Andrews, has been what has held it together through the
47:59
years, and still will, I think.
48:03
Programmatic constraints can only start damaging it so far before people will say,
48:10
“No wait a minute, this isn’t right and we’ve got to do something about it.” The
48:15
interesting thing about the research program on the Andrews is
48:22
there’s a certain core, a fairly small core, of
48:28
support for the research. People get this idea that there’s some big fat check that
48:33
pays for all the research in the Andrews.
48:36
But, if you look at the numbers, the majority of the research comes from
48:39
other grants that people get and bring through the Andrews, and add
48:43
to the LTER program, and before that,
48:51
EER, and before that, IBP.
48:51
The NSF-base funding from the Forest Service-base funding
48:54
together provide the nucleus, a
49:01
real powerful base for people to build research around because
49:07
we have long-term records.
49:10
We have expertise in many different areas, so, if suddenly you need
49:15
someone with soils expertise, you can go to Phil Sollins or
49:18
Kermit Cromack or Bob Griffiths.
49:21
If you need some terrestrial plant expertise, you can go to
49:26
Jerry or Art McKee, or whomever; you need geology, you go to Fred.
49:32
You can build on that so well, and we all count on it.
49:36
From time to time you’ll notice that, if different programs are
49:39
going strong, they’ll get a grant.
49:41
They have a big push and so it changes.
49:43
It just always kind of bubbles.
49:44
There’ll be a certain part of the team of scientists working the Andrews and
49:49
have a big push going and then they’ll diminish, and they’ll go down to a
49:53
kind of lower level of operation, and then another one kind of picks up.
49:57
So, it’s always kind of changing and a new grant comes in and it will be hot for a
50:01
few years, and then something else takes.
50:03
It’s kind of a research succession.
50:06
In
50:09
1978 there was a kind of a formalization of this agreement between OSU and the
50:14
Forest Service, as I understand, that had to do with the facilities out there.
50:18
There was a need to upgrade them and sorting out who would do that.
50:20
That kind of coincides with
50:23
when you started your post-doc work, is that right?
50:25
Right.
50:27
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your resource needs at that time
50:29
and the scientists on the Andrews, and what’s your perception of the
50:32
Andrews as a resource scientist?
50:37
That was an interesting time of change around
50:46
1978, from my point-of-view, just my perspective on things.
50:48
In late 1977, I went to work for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
50:55
For that three or four-year period, I had no formal ties to
51:02
the Andrews program because I was at the Fish and Wildlife Service.
51:07
But, there was a research grant we had from NSF that came in during that time
51:15
that I continued to work on, even though I was with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
51:19
Jim Sedell also left, I think in 1978, and went to work for
51:23
Weyerhaeuser up in Washington, heading aquatic research for Weyerhaeuser.
51:30
Ken Cummins, one of the world’s leading stream ecologists, came in right around
51:37
that time, I think ‘78, to replace Jim.
51:44
With him came a couple of other researchers, Milt Ward, and Amy Ward.
51:51
Milt was Ken’s student at Kellogg, at Michigan State, and he came as a
51:57
post-doc, and Amy came as a post-doc.
52:05
Suddenly the research team kind of changed.
52:08
There were still people like Norm Anderson around, and Jim Hall, but still, Cummins
52:16
and Milt and Amy Ward.
52:19
Cliff Dahm was a graduate student I was working with.
52:22
He and I were both graduate students together, he was in oceanography, and
52:26
we actually supported his graduate program for a few years working
52:30
dissolved organic carbon in streams.
52:33
He also finished up his degree and became a post-doc in the program.
52:41
So, the aquatic program kind of shifted right there in the late 70’s, early
52:45
80’s, particularly the early 80’s, we had kind of a new cast of characters.
52:53
I
53:01
didn’t see an abrupt change in research needs, it was just kind of a growing need.
53:06
As the Andrews was being used more and more, the old system of two trailers
53:13
and a warehouse just wasn’t cutting it.
53:17
So, it was a matter of finding some funding opportunities, both within NSF
53:25
and Forest Service that were aligned, and it was the right time to make a
53:31
move to develop a centralized facility there at the warehouse site, what
53:36
we used to call the warehouse site.
53:37
Had there been much change up until that point from when you first
53:40
started working at the Andrews?
53:42
As a matter-of-fact, I did all my research out of a camper on the
53:47
back of a pickup that we would take off and put on cinder blocks.
53:50
The
53:57
pre-1980’s days quickly get into stories of the old days.
54:04
Occasionally we’ll hear some of the students
54:09
griping about facilities or something.
54:12
You don’t want to go there, because you’ll get me back into the old days [laughter],
54:16
when all we had were two trailers and were suckin’ a hose that we used to
54:22
provide water from a creek, and I ended up suckin’ a rotten giant salamander.
54:28
It
54:31
was plugged one spring and we were trying to get it going again, and I
54:34
sucked on it and this funky fungused-up salamander shot into my mouth.
54:38
It took me about three days to get the taste out
54:42
of there.
54:42
[Chuckle]
54:44
In those days there was a trailer up on the hill above the Blue River
54:50
Ranger Station, and there was a trailer at Rainbow on up the river.
54:55
The Forest Service people by-and-large, used the trailer above the Blue River
54:59
Ranger Station, and the IBP researchers, university researchers, used the Rainbow
55:06
trailer, though there was some exchange.
55:08
I stayed up at the other one a little bit, some of the Forest Service
55:11
people stayed down at Rainbow.
55:13
But it was jammed, it was everyone using the Andrews packed into two trailers.
55:19
A lot of times you’d just end up camping, because you didn’t
55:22
want to be in the trailer.
55:23
It was just too jammed and not enough space.
55:28
So, we had to improvise more.
55:29
We didn’t have nice lab facilities.
55:33
To do some of our analytical work, we’d have to go down and
55:37
work in the chem lab in the Blue River Ranger Station, at night.
55:41
We used a water lab in the base of the Ranger Station
55:46
for processing samples sometimes.
55:50
And we used the warehouse.
55:54
We had a warehouse put up at the site that’s still there, that green
55:58
warehouse right as you drive in.
56:00
So, we would work out at the warehouse sometimes when we had
56:05
to process big batches of samples.
56:07
We’d work there.
56:12
But as I saw it, the facilities needs just kept growing and finally there
56:20
was some funding opportunities that lined up and it was right around
56:22
the time that I was getting ready to ship back to the university.
56:30
So, I kind of saw it from a slightly remote vantage point,
56:33
but was still involved in it.
56:35
Now when was that you shipped back?
56:37
Right around 1980.
56:38
‘80?
56:39
Yeah, ‘80-’81.
56:41
Right around the start of the LTER program is when I remember it.
56:46
I could be wrong on the exact years, but roughly.
56:49
So, you finished the Ph.D. in 1980?
56:53
‘81.
56:53
‘81. Okay.
56:54
It was actually finished in ’80, but the way the dates went on,
56:59
it was dated according to when I could go through commencement.
57:03
And that was based on work that you did while you were at
57:05
the Fish and Wildlife Service?
57:07
No, actually, it was late ’77.
57:11
I went to work for the Fish and Wildlife Service intending to finish up my degree.
57:17
Suddenly, it stretched out for three years, and I defended in 1980, delinquent.
57:22
You
57:34
spent a fair amount of time up there.
57:37
Were there places you went for relaxation, leisure time, recreational places,
57:43
while you were working at the Andrews?
57:45
Yeah.
57:50
Two major places that I would go were
57:59
back up in the Mack Creek watershed and Lookout Ridge.
58:05
That whole block of the southeast corner of the Andrews,
58:13
it’s kind of been my favorite spot back in the Andrews.
58:17
Every year I like to try to squeeze in a hike back up through Mack Creek,
58:23
all the way up to the ridge, and there’s some nice snow melt ponds that
58:29
sort of source from Mack Creek, and then go on around that little ridge.
58:37
Then Lookout Creek itself, skinny dipping in Lookout Creek, things like that.
58:47
It kind of varied according to
58:51
where we were staying.
58:54
Back when we stayed down at Rainbow, we did a lot of things down on the McKenzie.
58:57
Now that we’re staying up in the Andrews, I don’t do nearly as much
59:00
stuff down on the McKenzie, rafting and floating down, getting in a dry
59:05
suit and floating down the river.
59:08
And now, to be real honest, the
59:13
recreation is
59:18
not as regular as it used to be, because we’ll go up and
59:22
have this bout of field work.
59:24
You’ve worked hard all through the day, you get in about six or seven
59:27
at night, you’re kind of tired, you sit down and have dinner,
59:29
then play cards and drink beer.
59:33
A lot of it’s right there in the admin site [HJA] , to be honest.
59:36
You work hard in the field during the day, and you relax around the admin
59:40
site, occasionally, go pick mushrooms or something for the evening’s meal.
59:45
I
59:51
know folks up there that do mountain biking and kayaking or fishing and
59:58
things, and you can always tell when they get a second, they’re off and
1:00:03
doing those things, and I don’t do that as much as some other folks.
1:00:07
I used to do a little fly fishing around the McKenzie, Deer and
1:00:13
Tidbits [Creeks] , but I don’t do much of that anymore.
1:00:23
Our crew ends up doing things together, so I don’t end up going off and doing
1:00:30
things by myself as much as I used to.
1:00:35
Maybe you could talk about your involvement with the
1:00:38
local community in Blue River?
1:00:41
Has that changed over the years?
1:00:46
Yeah.
1:00:46
It’s
1:00:51
interesting.
1:00:51
The town of Blue River has changed over the years.
1:00:56
It’s been going through some sociological changes, and the Andrews has never been
1:01:05
a tightly knit part of the Blue River community.
1:01:09
It’s always been, “Those strange folks working up in the woods.” The
1:01:12
only people that I see really getting tied into the community are people
1:01:18
who live up there in the community as opposed to living in the Andrews.
1:01:23
Art McKee or a few of the other people that live there year-round,
1:01:26
and their kids might end up in the schools and things like that.
1:01:29
Art lived in Blue River and he was on the school board, so he became part of
1:01:33
the community for several years there.
1:01:36
I don’t see him being nearly as closely knit in the community as he used to be.
1:01:42
Many of the Forest Service people obviously are more closely knit
1:01:50
into the community than the university types are.
1:01:53
The university folks work out of Corvallis, and show up there, but
1:01:56
the main Forest Service people are stationed in Blue River.
1:01:59
But I’ve noticed, and this could be wrong, but it’s just my perception,
1:02:03
that now more of the Forest Service people are not living in Blue River.
1:02:08
They’re living in Eugene or elsewhere down river and commuting.
1:02:12
Yes, some others said that.
1:02:13
In the old days I think the majority of them lived right in Blue River.
1:02:20
So, when I would talk to them, you’d get into a little bit of the flavor
1:02:24
of the local politics and things.
1:02:27
The town also had more active bars back in those days.
1:02:31
My connection to the community was in the Blue River Tavern or the Cougar Room.
1:02:35
We’d get to know the locals by
1:02:39
having a beer with them and shooting pool.
1:02:46
The Cougar Room went through all kinds of changes, becoming a restaurant,
1:02:50
this, that and the other thing [topless] , finally burning down.
1:02:54
The Cougar Room had disappeared when it burned down.
1:02:59
It was called the Forest Glen when it burned down, but it still had a
1:03:03
back bar called the Cougar Room, I
1:03:08
think.
1:03:08
The Blue River Tavern kind of struggled for years, and it kind
1:03:13
of expanded and contracted, and now is a flea market, I think.
1:03:17
It’s not a tavern anymore.
1:03:20
There’s no reason to go into Blue River, except to pick up groceries
1:03:27
or get gas, so you don’t kind of cruise in the evening and shoot a
1:03:34
little pool and drink some beer.
1:03:37
You can still go up to the Log Cabin Inn.
1:03:38
You can’t shoot pool there, but you can get a beer there in the
1:03:42
Calico Room or whatever it’s called up at McKenzie Bridge.
1:03:45
This
1:03:52
place that you bop in on at the end of the Andrews day, it sounds
1:03:56
like you would come down there at the end of a working day maybe?
1:03:59
Right, yeah.
1:03:59
We wouldn’t really stop on the way in.
1:04:01
It was just a matter of after the working day, particularly when I was
1:04:04
younger [chuckle], I would go down and close down the bar at night, and
1:04:12
in doing so, meet more of the locals.
1:04:14
At that time in the ‘70’s, it was a weird mix.
1:04:23
Blue River was kind of on the fringe of Eugene, so they had a lot of
1:04:30
young counterculture people, and then, old traditionals, the logging culture.
1:04:34
It was a real interesting blend sometimes, not getting along.
1:04:38
There was a little bit of a drug culture up there for awhile because
1:04:41
they were planting down in Eugene, and so people came to the periphery.
1:04:46
There was an interesting blend going on at the time, and we got
1:04:50
a little bit of it at the bars.
1:04:51
I remember going in and playing foosball once, and a couple of us
1:04:55
thinking we were pretty good, and a couple of locals come up, put
1:04:58
the quarter down and challenged us.
1:05:00
So, we’re sitting there and they’re chatting with us as we were
1:05:02
playing, and we could tell from the questions, you know, “Who are you?
1:05:06
Where are you doing?
1:05:08
Where do you work?” After we told them we were collecting fish up in Mack Creek
1:05:12
and da da da da da, they pretty much knew that we weren’t narcs [chuckle],
1:05:16
they boom, boom, boom, boom, just cleaned us out [chuckle], and said, “Thanks for
1:05:20
the game!” and walked off [laughter].
1:05:23
So, there was that side of things that I don’t see anymore.
1:05:26
It may still be out there, but I just don’t get a glimpse
1:05:28
of it the way I used to.
1:05:30
And
1:05:33
Blue River seems to be aging a little bit.
1:05:36
The counterculture is still up there, the logging community is still up there,
1:05:39
but it’s all aged a little bit, and doesn’t seem as dynamic as it used to be.
1:05:46
Economically I think they’re struggling.
1:05:48
It’s becoming more of a summer home type community for Eugene than a
1:05:53
mountain community in its own right.
1:06:09
I think they kind of know that the Andrews is there, but it’s peripheral
1:06:15
to their life and social structure.
1:06:18
It’s
1:06:21
never a big deal and the only people that notice it are the Forest
1:06:23
Service types that interact with
1:06:29
it.
1:06:29
It’s interesting.
1:06:31
The Andrews is right on the boundary between the McKenzie District
1:06:36
and the Blue River District.
1:06:38
There’s always been a strong tie to the Blue River
1:06:43
District, and there’s never been antagonism.
1:06:47
At times, I’ve sensed a tiny bit of resentment on the part of the McKenzie
1:06:52
District for the Blue River District getting all this credit and kudos
1:06:55
for things happening at the Andrews.
1:07:00
That’s probably incorrect, but I still kind of sense it from time-to-time.
1:07:07
It’s always baffled me why they’re haven’t been stronger support from both districts.
1:07:13
I mean, the Andrews could easily be viewed as a part of both programs, but because
1:07:18
it falls entirely within the Blue River District, I guess that never has happened.
1:07:22
Who do you work with most commonly at the district?
1:07:25
People there
1:07:28
that you’ve been closer to?
1:07:28
John Cissel and recently Jim Capurso, but he just left.
1:07:36
He was a fish biologist there on the district.
1:07:38
What was his last name?
1:07:38
Jim Capurso.
1:07:38
And Michelle McSwain was the hydrologist for
1:07:42
the district.
1:07:43
And then,
1:07:53
Dick
1:07:56
Bickford.
1:07:58
He’s still there as a fish bio.
1:08:01
And
1:08:07
Karen Geary in the, kind of GIS shop, and Terry.
1:08:14
I forget her last name, in the GIS shop.
1:08:17
And
1:08:24
Monty Wilson,
1:08:30
who was head of the timber operations.
1:08:37
And there was a Brad.
1:08:40
I forget Brad’s last name.
1:08:41
He’d been there for a long time and unfortunately was one of
1:08:44
the pink slips things, he got a transfer to another place.
1:08:48
But he’d been up on the district for about 20 years, or 15 years.
1:08:52
Brad Levitt,
1:08:56
he was more in terms of general operations.
1:08:59
I’m not sure what his official title was, but a lot of the programmatic things we’d
1:09:06
have to do, Brad would give us a hand.
1:09:07
And then Jim Mayo
1:09:13
on the Augusta Creek work, things
1:09:20
like that.
1:09:20
Actually,
1:09:25
I’ve never had a negative interaction with any of the
1:09:27
Blue River-Forest Service staff.
1:09:29
They’ve always been supportive of what we’ve been doing, at the very
1:09:35
least tolerant, and in most cases enthusiastically supportive in trying
1:09:40
to help us with what we’ve been
1:09:45
doing.
1:09:46
The only thing that I can remember is back when I was a grad student,
1:09:49
first here, right around ‘74-’75.
1:09:52
I
1:09:55
forget who the district ranger was at that time, but he didn’t
1:10:01
like all these university types swarming all over the district.
1:10:06
And I remember he sent out a memo about “Naked hippies driving cars at
1:10:15
high speeds on the Andrews, and this was going to have to stop!” So, we always
1:10:18
talked about the naked hippie memo.
1:10:19
[Chuckle]
1:10:20
Was
1:10:24
there a lot of that going on?
1:10:25
[Laughter]
1:10:26
Not naked!
1:10:28
[Laughter] We may have been driving too fast.
1:10:30
I will probably ‘fess up to that.
1:10:35
So, that was about the only negative interaction I can remember.
1:10:42
Generally, the district rangers have been great.
1:10:45
Lynn’s [Burditt] always been supportive.
1:10:47
Steve Eubanks before her,
1:10:51
Jim, what’s his name, before Steve?
1:10:53
I think it was Caswell, I can’t remember now.
1:11:04
But it’s been good, compared to the early IBP days when I think
1:11:07
there was a little bit of friction.
1:11:08
I don’t think the district ranger was thrilled
1:11:15
with things, so Jerry and Dick Waring got to deal with him.
1:11:20
So right in the early ‘70s, it didn’t seem like it was as
1:11:23
chummy as it has been since.
1:11:25
Were there check-in procedures or anything when you were working out there, or
1:11:29
things you had to do or people you had to see, before you went and started
1:11:31
working on a site at the Andrews?
1:11:34
In terms of the safety concerns that we have now, no.
1:11:37
But in terms of before we could start doing projects, I remember
1:11:44
as a grad student, I had to do a project where we actually released
1:11:46
radioactive tracer into the stream.
1:11:48
We had to go through all this approval up through the PNW,
1:11:53
and get authorization to do so.
1:11:58
I remember doing that.
1:11:59
In
1:12:03
IBP as well as the LTER, it was the general understanding that you didn’t
1:12:07
do anything that would permanently alter a site or greatly disrupt
1:12:10
a site, without running it by the overall group and getting approval.
1:12:16
So, even in IBP days, if I wanted to do something where we started clipping
1:12:20
vegetation or chopping down vegetation in Mack Creek to do an experiment
1:12:23
or something, I would have to get approval of the whole IBP group.
1:12:28
Same thing with the LTER now.
1:12:30
Any kind of destructive sampling that we might do, we’ve always had to get approval
1:12:37
because it’s one of the big challenges
1:12:39
So
1:12:46
that was an informal process?
1:12:49
It varied in formality.
1:12:50
There were actually times I was even
1:12:55
responsible for requests to make it more formal, and we adopted some policies.
1:13:00
But we’ve always
1:13:05
strongly discouraged the people from doing anything that permanently
1:13:08
alters the site, and, if it does, to get approval from the general group.
1:13:16
So, if I submit a proposal to NSF,
1:13:21
the policy of the LTER is to have it approved.
1:13:24
You have to describe it at the LTER meeting, and
1:13:29
if it’s ’gonna be something major, it has to have the approval
1:13:32
of the PI and site manager.
1:13:34
Our
1:13:36
group at least has to know that, and they can decide whether it
1:13:40
needs a vote or discussion or appoint a committee to look into it.
1:13:45
People coming in from outside the Andrews have to run their proposals
1:13:48
for whatever they’re doing by
1:13:52
Art McKee and Fred Swanson at the very least, and maybe more as needed.
1:13:58
Practically all those requests get circulated to all of the leadership teams.
1:14:02
The co-PI’s on it, so in case there’s any concerns and it gets brought up in
1:14:06
meetings so they can say, “Speak up, if you’ve got a problem with this.”
1:14:11
Because cumulatively over the years, we can destroy those 16 thousand
1:14:15
acres, so that all we do is study the effects of scientists, and don’t
1:14:19
really study the ecosystem any more.
1:14:23
I think most of us really work hard to try to make sure that our projects
1:14:31
don’t cause permanent loss of the research potential of the Andrews.
1:14:40
But, there’s still a challenge.
1:14:41
You still find what we call “science garbage” out all over the Andrews.
1:14:45
Stuff left over from studies 30 years ago that someone just never cleaned up.
1:14:53
Even on our own sites, about once every year or two, we have a two-day clean
1:14:58
up where we just go out on site and try to clean up some of the flagging
1:15:04
and posts and things that have been placed around and are no longer active.
1:15:09
It sounds like a lot of that is still at the discretion of the project leader.
1:15:12
Yes.
1:15:13
Pretty much.
1:15:14
It’s still largely informal.
1:15:18
We expect people to act responsibly and
1:15:25
think about the best interests of the Andrews program, and if
1:15:28
they don’t, we deal with it.
1:15:32
There’s very little chance of causing great permanent damage
1:15:37
without someone noticing, but it’s always lurking out there.
1:15:40
We are living in fear of someone going out and permanently poisoning
1:15:46
a site or something like that.
1:15:47
I can’t imagine anyone being stupid enough to do it, but all it takes is one person.
1:15:56
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your philosophy or strategy for recruiting
1:16:00
and hiring staff or assistants out there?
1:16:05
That’s been an interesting one over the years and watching how our program
1:16:10
has done it, and then also, how
1:16:14
my personal philosophy has evolved.
1:16:17
When I hire research assistants or students, besides looking at their
1:16:25
experience, academic record and skills, I also look at their people skills and call
1:16:33
their references, and talk to them about how well they get along in group settings,
1:16:38
and ask if are they team players.
1:16:39
Occasionally
1:16:43
you run into people who can’t even sit in a room by themselves without
1:16:47
having an argument, and they’re just destroying any kind of group effort.
1:16:54
Occasionally, you run into people who are brilliant and well-focused, but they’re
1:16:57
totally self-serving and self-centered in the way they approach their research.
1:17:04
While that can be quite successful in a team setting, it destroys
1:17:09
the trust and confidence that team members have in one another.
1:17:14
So,
1:17:17
for a summer temporary position to a permanent faculty position
1:17:23
I apply that standard very heavily, and it weighs equally to
1:17:29
their ability and experience and productivity.
1:17:33
I’ve been very fortunate, as I’ve had great people in the program,
1:17:42
though you do run into personality conflicts.
1:17:45
There are people who can’t get a long from time-to-time.
1:17:51
But having the majority of people in a group that can work together very well,
1:17:56
even helps through those tough times.
1:17:58
We’ve bumped into a couple of them.
1:18:00
There have been personality conflicts within our group.
1:18:06
But I think people look at the Andrews in general and the large
1:18:10
number of people that are up there, the 30 to 75 researchers that are
1:18:13
up there at any one point-in-time, people get along amazingly well.
1:18:17
There are very few
1:18:21
outward conflicts, and people resolve their problems fairly effectively.
1:18:26
You know, you get that many people in one small place you’re going to have conflict.
1:18:31
We’ve generally been able to take those issues on and deal
1:18:33
with them constructively.
1:18:36
One issue that’s come up in interviews is the difference between
1:18:40
hiring post-doctoral or graduate students to help on projects.
1:18:47
I was curious what your philosophy was on that?
1:18:53
I worry about that from time-to-time.
1:18:55
I’ve kind of let the research itself dictate what the
1:18:58
most appropriate hiring is.
1:19:01
For a variety of reasons coming out of IBP and the River Continuum Project,
1:19:06
we’ve had some research assistants that we’ve put a lot of responsibility
1:19:12
in their hands in the aquatic program, unlike some of the others.
1:19:18
And we’ve gotten some very effective research assistants over the years.
1:19:25
That’s been one of our strengths.
1:19:28
One of my philosophies has been, in a research team, if you get constructive
1:19:32
people on the research team and make a long-term commitment to their careers,
1:19:36
I try to make a commitment to them as well, to the degree possible.
1:19:40
It means there’s a continuity, but you don’t change and suddenly abruptly
1:19:45
decide, “Well, maybe you don’t need a research assistant, maybe we need
1:19:49
a grad student, or maybe we need a post-doc.” That means you’re terminating
1:19:52
someone, and they have a livelihood. So,
1:20:01
I’ve tried to balance what the research needs are versus what I
1:20:05
consider the academic needs are for the research program, versus
1:20:09
personal commitments to people.
1:20:13
I think you see that running through the Andrews programs, and in some cases,
1:20:16
some decisions, both on the Forest Service side and the academic side, have
1:20:20
been personal commitments to people.
1:20:22
There are people who’ve had long-term presence on the Andrews, and their
1:20:26
position wouldn’t necessarily be the most effective or efficient at
1:20:30
any given point-in-time, but over the years they’ve been tremendously
1:20:35
important in the success of the Andrews.
1:20:38
And the fact that they have that continuity gives them a base that
1:20:41
you don’t get unless you do invest in that, but it does mean you have
1:20:48
a little bit less flexibility.
1:20:49
There have been times, because of research grants, that we’ve gone with post-docs.
1:20:54
We’ve had post-docs like Gary Lamberti, Donna D’Angelo, and Dale McCullough,
1:21:01
who were post-docs a little while.
1:21:03
I was a post-doc.
1:21:04
And we had Milt and Amy Ward who came on as post-docs, and then Chuck Hawkins.
1:21:13
They all were post-docs.
1:21:14
So, the aquatic program over the years has had,
1:21:19
easily ten or twelve post-docs.
1:21:22
At this point-in-time we don’t have any post-docs.
1:21:25
We’ve got either grad students or research assistants.
1:21:28
So,
1:21:31
I don’t have a fixed structure that I generally tend to go for.
1:21:35
I get concerned when we don’t have enough grad students, and we start going
1:21:38
toward research assistants and post-docs.
1:21:41
I get concerned when we don’t have the continuity, that if it’s just
1:21:47
graduate students, they have short-term interests they need for their program,
1:21:52
but they don’t have the continuity and expertise to help with that.
1:21:58
From my point-of-view, often just in terms of administrative research,
1:22:01
it makes it extremely efficient to have experienced research
1:22:05
assistants over long-term post-docs.
1:22:08
Long-term post-docs in the long run, that’s not a good thing,
1:22:13
because it’s a disservice to a person in that position for their
1:22:16
career to be a long-term post-doc.
1:22:19
They need to be moving up in the academic ranks, so they tend to be more
1:22:27
transient; moving on to another position.
1:22:30
To
1:22:34
be honest, I try to take a look at the research that we’re doing and the
1:22:41
balance in a program, what the needs are.
1:22:43
I don’t dictate it specifically on, “I want a certain mix.” But, if it starts
1:22:50
heading toward one end of the spectrum or the other, it starts making me feel
1:22:55
a bit uneasy, and so I’ll probably start writing proposals that allow me
1:23:01
to move back towards another direction.
1:23:05
Is there a deterrent to heavy reliance on graduate students
1:23:07
in case of funding cutbacks, or
1:23:12
the Forest Service?
1:23:14
It’s part of the funding scene
1:23:18
to go for a full post-doc, unless it’s a trainer-ship
1:23:22
kind of a program or something.
1:23:23
If you just put a full post-doc in the proposal these days,
1:23:28
it means that suddenly you’re talking about a chunk of probably
1:23:33
seventy-five thousand dollars a year by the time you pay fringe benefits,
1:23:37
overhead, and things like that.
1:23:42
Yeah, seventy-five to eighty thousand dollars and dedicate it to a post-doc,
1:23:47
that’s a big chunk of a research proposal.
1:23:49
You can’t write too many of those in unless you’ve got mega-money coming in.
1:23:58
We have
1:24:03
one person, Judy Li, who’s in a research assistant professor position, kind of the
1:24:08
next step up in promotion from post-doc.
1:24:12
So, we go into the soft money research, professorial, or academic positions,
1:24:19
and most of my post-docs have moved into those before they actually
1:24:22
moved out of the post-doc position.
1:24:24
We do still have Judy Li as one of those in our program.
1:24:30
She’s getting so senior that I have trouble thinking of her that
1:24:34
way anymore, she’s just one of the research professors in my opinion,
1:24:38
but she came up through the ranks.
1:24:44
How long has she been here?
1:24:46
Let’s see, probably ‘84, something like that, early 1990’s, mid 80’s.
1:24:56
She
1:24:58
was first Ken Cummins’ grad student, then she became my student when Ken left.
1:25:05
She finished her Ph.D. with me, and then has been
1:25:12
post-doc-ing on a couple of my grants, and now is research assistant
1:25:17
professor, and also teaching.
1:25:20
From
1:25:27
time-to-time I’ve talked to Fred, and Fred’s had concerns
1:25:29
and interests about the overall balance in the Andrews program.
1:25:34
Do we have enough young people?
1:25:35
Do we have enough post-docs?
1:25:37
Do we have contacts?
1:25:38
Because some of the principle investigators have very busy schedules
1:25:41
and getting them is tough, so sometimes people like seeing post-docs around.
1:25:49
We’ve had discussions about that.
1:25:50
But, I think any kind of fixed policy or fixed goal of a certain
1:25:56
distribution, isn’t going to work.
1:25:58
You have to kind of be opportunistic and just pay attention to
1:26:04
the strengths and some of the emerging weaknesses as they occur, and use
1:26:09
opportunities to shift those around.
1:26:12
But to be honest, watching it over the years, I don’t think
1:26:13
there’s any perfect blend.
1:26:15
We’ve had graduate students that essentially function
1:26:19
almost as faculty members.
1:26:20
They’ve had such strong and aggressive leadership skills.
1:26:26
We’ve had doctoral members that didn’t really exercise a major influence.
1:26:30
You
1:26:32
get lots of different
1:26:36
interactions.
1:26:39
I don’t think there’s a magic answer there.
1:26:48
What proportion of work do you try to get done up there using graduate students
1:26:53
and post-docs as compared with the Forest Service technicians or their employees?
1:26:57
What’s the manpower/need ratio?
1:27:02
My program or the overall Andrews program?
1:27:04
Your program in particular, and what you know of the overall.
1:27:09
In my program, we’ve had cooperation with Forest Service, but we haven’t really
1:27:19
counted on it as part of the research.
1:27:25
The one exception would be the last, not this summer, but the previous two summers,
1:27:30
1995 and 1996, we did have for a four-week period use some of the Forest Service
1:27:38
fish crews on our electroshocking sampling crew, but that was kind of a first.
1:27:45
So, on any of our restoration experiments, we usually use the Forest Service
1:27:52
to carry out the contracting and installation, with us advising them.
1:28:00
For installing some of the equipment that require contracts and things,
1:28:03
we’ve worked together on those.
1:28:08
Otherwise, we’ve pretty much relied on our students, technicians, and
1:28:14
post-docs to get the research done.
1:28:19
We may coordinate with them, but we don’t count them in doing the work.
1:28:25
In the program overall,
1:28:32
I’d make the distinction between the Forest Service PNW researchers versus
1:28:37
the Forest Service district people.
1:28:42
Obviously, the Forest Service researchers have a major presence on the Andrews.
1:28:50
Without thinking, I’d put it roughly 50/50, without the difference is going
1:28:55
to be slightly skewed either way.
1:29:00
Regarding the district people and their involvement,
1:29:04
I would say that their presence and their involvement has grown in recent years.
1:29:13
They are playing more of a role particularly the application
1:29:20
of the research into policy.
1:29:22
Things like the Augusta Creek project, and now the Blue River AMA [Adaptive
1:29:28
Management Area] Landscape project.
1:29:29
The district’s [Blue River R.D.] providing a lot of leadership
1:29:32
in that end of the research.
1:29:36
And, there are some notable exceptions.
1:29:37
People like Matt Hunter working on amphibians and streams, and so there
1:29:43
are research pieces that are done from time-to-time by [Willamette
1:29:49
National] Forest Service employees.
1:29:50
How
1:29:53
about work away from the Andrews?
1:29:55
What portion of your work do you do away from the Andrews?
1:29:59
It varies.
1:29:59
There’ll
1:30:02
be years that it will be 80% plus.
1:30:06
I would say this year, probably 80% of our work is in and around the Andrews.
1:30:12
There are other years it may only be 30% or so, like when we were
1:30:17
working up at Mount St. Helens or over in the Coast Range.
1:30:22
Next summer, we’re going to have a project going on the Willamette
1:30:24
River, the question is, does that count as Andrews or not.
1:30:27
It really won’t directly be the Andrews.
1:30:30
We’ll probably work out of OSU instead of going up to the Andrews to do it.
1:30:34
It’s related, but somewhat distant.
1:30:37
I’d say it ranges between 30-80% being in the Andrews, which is a
1:30:46
function of what research is coming in.
1:30:49
Please
1:30:58
talk about the evolution of your ideas about plant/herbivore interactions
1:31:01
between ecosystems and how that’s evolved over the last decade or so?
1:31:10
I guess that my research focus has evolved.
1:31:16
I’d say my interests and concepts of
1:31:21
stream ecosystems
1:31:25
have changed or grown as the research has added more information,
1:31:31
but it all grows from trying to understand how stream ecosystems work
1:31:37
and the landscape context of a river network.
1:31:43
Right
1:31:46
from the first when it was just studying primary production, to
1:31:49
going into looking at plant/herbivore interactions, to nutrient dynamics,
1:31:55
to large wood, to fish assemblages, to disturbance and restoration approaches,
1:32:02
it’s still trying to figure out how a stream ecosystem ticks, and how that
1:32:08
river network fits into the landscape.
1:32:12
There’ll
1:32:14
be times a particular research project gives me the ability to
1:32:17
focus on a piece of the puzzle.
1:32:20
At one point, I may look at plant/herbivore interactions, and try to
1:32:23
see how they compare to plant/herbivore interactions in other ecosystems.
1:32:30
But then, as that research winds down, other research opportunities, such as
1:32:35
looking at fish communities, may come up.
1:32:37
So, I’ll start looking at long-term fish
1:32:41
assemblage dynamics and
1:32:44
habitat relationships.
1:32:48
Now, we’re shifting into some even landscape-level restoration
1:32:55
analysis, how we screen the landscape for restoration potential.
1:33:03
It may look like it’s going from process-level work, up to community-level
1:33:08
work, and up to ecosystems and landscapes.
1:33:11
The scale my research
1:33:14
focus has been growing, but actually from my perspective it’s been the same.
1:33:19
It’s just addressing opportunities to look at different pieces of the puzzle.
1:33:23
There’ll be in grants and things that come by in competitions, and they’ll
1:33:29
focus on certain types of research.
1:33:31
I’ve to some degree been opportunistic.
1:33:36
So that opportunistic approach means availability of funding or other
1:33:40
people doing similar kinds of research?
1:33:43
Both.
1:33:44
Availability of funding for the most part, but also a chance to cooperate
1:33:47
with others on particular projects.
1:33:49
All
1:33:52
of it still having, on my part at least, the same focus of trying to understand
1:33:55
the stream ecosystem, and it’s part of either the multi-disciplinary
1:34:01
or the jack-of-all-trades characteristics of my research.
1:34:06
I don’t like to just be known as a fish ecologist, or just a plant ecologist, or a
1:34:13
water chemist.
1:34:13
I like to be known as a stream ecologist who is knowledgeable of everything,
1:34:18
from water chemistry to geomorphology to ecological processes to community
1:34:25
dynamics to landscape processes.
1:34:29
That’s what I enjoy, trying to figure out how it all works together.
1:34:33
Do you look at any work or any centers of research elsewhere that are kind
1:34:37
of models for what you’d like to build in your research programs?
1:34:41
There are research centers around that I admire, and
1:34:48
I frequently check out what they’re doing because I admire their work and to see
1:34:55
which directions they’re heading in.
1:34:57
Examples would be the Coweeta program in Georgia and the Arizona State program
1:35:04
with Stuart Fisher and Nancy Grimm, and the New Mexico Sevilleta program with
1:35:08
Cliff Dahm and Jim Gosz and those folks.
1:35:17
I guess programmatically, those would be the three.
1:35:23
Then there’s just the larger community of stream ecologists.
1:35:26
There’s a society called the North American Benthological Society.
1:35:33
NABS meetings each year have the most current aquatic research
1:35:36
in streams around the world.
1:35:39
So, you watch what’s happening in the field in general in terms of ideas,
1:35:45
and note things that you feel you have the expertise to start to step in
1:35:49
and grapple with some of the issues.
1:35:52
If you look at your practical research, are there any particular studies
1:35:58
that are problem solving methods that you’re particularly proud of?
1:36:01
That you made a major breakthrough in your ability to understand these systems?
1:36:18
There are no landmark pieces that I would
1:36:25
necessarily jump at.
1:36:27
I think a lot of the work we’ve done on forest/stream interactions, riparian
1:36:32
work, is synthetic and has provided a context for a lot of research in streams.
1:36:41
So,
1:36:44
a lot of the riparian research, would be one.
1:36:48
And I’m
1:36:53
interested in the emerging research we’re doing that deals
1:36:57
with disturbance and restoration,
1:37:01
and how that fits into ecosystem processes, like the large wood and
1:37:06
geomorphology and vegetation work.
1:37:10
I like the way the riparian research is moving into landscapes
1:37:15
and disturbance and restoration.
1:37:22
The only one that could be pointed to as kind of a coherent product that stands
1:37:27
alone, would be the riparian research.
1:37:29
And one of the cool things about the riparian research is that I see it as
1:37:32
a nice blend of basic research, and
1:37:36
then, application to land management.
1:37:41
A lot of riparian research in the 80’s led to an unfortunate problem
1:37:50
that the Forest Service was running into, that allowed us to develop
1:37:53
the riparian management guidelines for the Willamette National Forest.
1:37:59
Back in the late 80’s, the Forest Service was suddenly challenged with
1:38:04
coming up with a new forest plan before the Northwest Forest Plan [developed in
1:38:07
1980s, culminating in Willamette National Forest plan of 1990] . I had been asked
1:38:11
to sit on a committee to review their riparian guidelines for the national
1:38:15
forest, and suddenly, the entire committee got eaten alive doing this forest plan.
1:38:21
A couple rangers asked me if I would take a stab at writing the guidelines myself.
1:38:32
Rangers Herb Wick and Steve Eubanks asked me if we would be willing to, and Linda
1:38:37
Ashkenas and I wrote up some guidelines.
1:38:41
They were really open, saying, “If you see any things you think should
1:38:46
be changed, just note them and we’ll take a look at them.” So, for
1:38:49
about a year-and-a-half there, we developed riparian guidelines for the
1:38:54
Willamette, and they approved them.
1:38:57
I still remember, it was amazing,
1:39:00
we called for no harvest in any of the riparian management zones, we called for
1:39:12
all floodplains to be included within those riparian management zones, and
1:39:17
we called for 200-foot widths on the large streams and even on the ephemeral
1:39:24
streams, the class 4 streams as they’re called, having buffer strips along those.
1:39:31
So, we went on this field trip at the end of it, and it had gone out for draft.
1:39:36
We sent it out to all the districts for comments, and I was surprised,
1:39:39
as I expected the timber beasts to just go crazy when they saw this.
1:39:42
And the only comments that we got back were how to strengthen it,
1:39:45
and how to put more meat in it.
1:39:46
I remember being out in the field and a couple of things blew me away.
1:39:49
We had this thing about no harvest in the riparian management zones,
1:39:53
and I expected a bunch of the timber types would not be happy with that.
1:39:58
It came up for discussion, but Monty [Wilson] , the timber
1:40:03
operations leader for the Blue River District
1:40:08
who had just been there for about a year at that point, stepped up and said, that
1:40:12
he’d seen a number of riparian zones that were gone into for partial harvest, and
1:40:18
almost none of them had the final product what they were really shooting for.
1:40:23
He said, “Until we know that we can go in there and do what we say we’re
1:40:27
doing, we shouldn’t be messing around in there.” I was kind of blown away.
1:40:31
He was very supportive, other people were supportive, and finally, we got
1:40:35
to the very last stop of the day, and Mike Kerrick, the supervisor at the time
1:40:42
said, “Wait a minute. These little ephemeral streams, leaving buffer
1:40:47
strips on every little ephemeral stream, there’s a lot of them up here.
1:40:52
What’s your reasoning on that?” The cool thing was, he wasn’t saying, “This
1:40:56
is crazy!” or “This is bullshit!” He was saying, “What are you thinking?
1:41:00
I mean, why would we do this?” So, we explained about landslides and
1:41:05
debris flows coming down and the large wood stabilizing that and
1:41:09
slowing down the runout distances.
1:41:16
So he said, “Well, then that sounds to me like, if it’s a stable
1:41:23
part of a watershed with an ephemeral stream, and you’ve got a lot of understory
1:41:26
vegetation over the creek so it doesn’t get hot, you don’t really have to have
1:41:30
that for your functions that you’ve described?” We said, “No, I guess
1:41:34
that’s right, if it’s stable.” He said, “Well then, how about going back to the
1:41:39
drawing board and just rewriting this one section so that you can deal with
1:41:44
all the functions you’ve identified?
1:41:46
But don’t make an across-the-board buffer strip.” So, we ended up with
1:41:51
a classification of unstable lands as well as moderately stable and stable.
1:41:56
We said, “Okay, you have to have this 25-75 foot, no-harvest buffer
1:42:00
strip on ephemeral streams, if it’s in an unstable category.
1:42:04
There’s an intermediate practice for the moderately stable, and you don’t have
1:42:10
to have any special precautions on the stable class four streams.” That was the
1:42:15
first time that I know of in this region that they were leaving buffer strips on
1:42:18
little streams that dry up in the summer.
1:42:24
They adopted them, and they had been in place for just a little bit less
1:42:28
than a year when the Timber Summit occurred with Clinton . Suddenly,
1:42:35
with the Northwest Forest Plan, they [Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment
1:42:37
Team or FEMAT] were considering these broader conservation strategies across
1:42:41
the region, and they looked at what we’d developed for the Willamette, used it
1:42:44
as a starting point and built on it.
1:42:47
In essence, it eclipsed the Willamette’s plan by going even broader.
1:42:55
There’s a real cool thing we did there, because it made it more scaled to the
1:42:58
system than just an arbitrary distance.
1:43:02
But they were able to use the Willamette as a reference point, saying, “Now,
1:43:06
in addition, this is what we need.” As a result, the Willamette plan
1:43:11
didn’t get as much visibility in and of itself, but it helped the
1:43:16
evolution of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:43:19
The cool thing about all that; it was a direct application of basic research
1:43:26
into on the ground application and at the National Forest scale, that came about
1:43:32
very constructively and without very much antagonistic interaction and conflict,
1:43:38
which then led, very productively, into the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:43:42
From my point-of-view, it’s a great success story of basic research working
1:43:48
with co-operative land managers and the agencies leading to a regional strategy.
1:43:55
I
1:43:57
would consider that one of the real success stories of the last few years.
1:44:03
Did the Willamette Forest Plan publication come out at some point in there?
1:44:07
Yeah.
1:44:08
You wouldn’t have a copy of that I can borrow, would you?
1:44:10
So,
1:44:16
you finished the work on this in 1990?
1:44:18
Right.
1:44:19
When did that start?
1:44:20
What was the time frame for this?
1:44:21
I started in late
1:44:30
1988.
1:44:30
Did you have much involvement with the Northwest Forest Plan yourself?
1:44:33
Not directly.
1:44:33
That was more, Jim Sedell was in there, Gordie Reeves, a
1:44:40
lot of people, and Fred [Swanson] and Gordon Grant.
1:44:43
All those guys were in the day-to-day, living in the “bowels of the beast.”
1:44:49
I was lucky, they wanted only agency people.
1:44:53
They decided,
1:44:55
in general, not to include university types.
1:45:01
I was on the panel reviewing some of it, but only took a couple
1:45:05
of days worth of work up there, then reviewing documents for it.
1:45:09
I was peripheral to the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:45:12
But it was cool, it was fun watching it, and I spent a lot of time talking to
1:45:16
Fred and Jim and Gordie and Gordon, saw
1:45:22
what was happening, and kind of kibbitzing and kicking around.
1:45:26
But, they were the ones who paid the cost, Tom Spies and Mike Collopy and all those
1:45:31
guys, Bob Anthony in the department here.
1:45:34
I had lots of contact through people I work with to what was going on day-to-day.
1:45:39
They were the ones that were sacrificing their lives.
1:45:42
It was amazing the sacrifice those folks made.
1:45:45
That’s why when people ask, I say I was involved, but didn’t have to pay
1:45:50
anything like the cost they had to pay in their professional and personal
1:45:53
lives to make that thing happen.
1:45:56
That’s something that no one in this region acknowledges,
1:45:59
and it still irritates me.
1:46:00
And the Clinton administration didn’t acknowledge it either.
1:46:02
It was just this thing, “We want a regional conservation plan, period.
1:46:07
We want you to drop everything you’re doing, and we want you to spend all
1:46:09
your time in Portland developing this regional conservation plan that we
1:46:13
know is going to be controversial.” So, a three-month project turns
1:46:18
into a six-month to nine-month to a year, but they got the product out.
1:46:27
Those folks were on I-5, everyday, either that, or living up in Portland.
1:46:32
They’d get an apartment and stuff.
1:46:34
So, their families didn’t see them for months on end, except for,
1:46:40
they’d get in, sleep, have breakfast with them, then leave, and then,
1:46:44
you’re exhausted for the weekend.
1:46:47
They paid a hell of a price that I don’t think anyone has ever
1:46:50
acknowledged or thanked them for.
1:46:51
And I get really pissed off when I see people in the region badmouthing
1:46:55
it, and I don’t think they realize what these people contributed.
1:47:00
I
1:47:08
was wondering if you could talk a little on your ideas about the relative
1:47:13
importance of teaching and communicating the results of your research.
1:47:16
In other words, who you view as your audience, or who should be the
1:47:19
audience for scientific research, the kind you’re involved in.
1:47:23
Well, it obviously comes down to both the public and to scientists, and
1:47:30
the public being in a broad sense.
1:47:31
Well, I guess, public resource managers and scientists, and there’s
1:47:35
obviously some blends in all of those.
1:47:41
I don’t think my research would be successful, if it left
1:47:46
any one of those three out.
1:47:47
It has to be a balance between those.
1:47:55
I think one of the strengths of the Andrews program is that it has contributed
1:48:01
very effectively in all three fronts.
1:48:04
There are a number of cases, obviously, with all the tours that we do on the
1:48:08
site, where the public comes up and sees what’s happening in research.
1:48:12
We get out and talk around the region in just endless presentations.
1:48:16
I’m sure each and every one of us average three to four presentations
1:48:20
a month to schools and public groups and conferences and whatever.
1:48:26
There are times it gets more intense, and times it gets less intense.
1:48:32
Also, within the agencies, workshops for professionals, and field tours for
1:48:38
professionals, and large numbers of those.
1:48:41
Then, the
1:48:45
scientists going to ecological society meetings, ESA meetings or
1:48:51
NABS meetings, or American Fishery Society meetings, and presenting
1:48:54
the results there and publishing.
1:48:56
It’s got to be all three, and at any point-in-time certain ones
1:49:02
kind of overwhelm you for a few months, and you shift it around.
1:49:14
One of the things I’ve just started noticing in the last year or two and
1:49:18
would like to do something about,
1:49:25
is the role of the Andrews in education at OSU has not been as
1:49:33
direct as it could be, I fear.
1:49:36
I see that’s a place where we could make some significant contributions.
1:49:43
It’s a new area that we could move into.
1:49:46
We’ve always been part of education.
1:49:48
We’ve had classes and field trips at the Andrews and things like that.
1:49:55
Researchers at the Andrews have taught classes, so there’s been that kind
1:49:58
of exchange, but the academic role of the Andrews has never been really
1:50:11
aggressively pursued.
1:50:13
To say, “We want an active presence on this campus.
1:50:15
Here’s a program that can provide something to students.” I mean,
1:50:19
students know it, they hear about the Andrews when they get in their classes,
1:50:22
but nothing that’s that visible.
1:50:25
And we’ve been cautious, we don’t want departments to think we’re trying to step
1:50:31
in as a super department or something like that, to have our own academic program.
1:50:36
But, it seems like we could do a little bit more.
1:50:38
From time-to-time in the LTER meetings, I must admit, as an academic, I get a little
1:50:42
bit frustrated because it’s assumed that we’re spending our every waking moment
1:50:48
on the research side of the Andrews.
1:50:52
When you say you can’t make a meeting because of classes, it’s like, “Oh, you’ve
1:50:56
got to teach a class? Good grief, what a pain, what a hindrance!” It’s like,
1:51:00
“Wait a minute. No, this is a university!” Teaching should be viewed as a real
1:51:06
positive thing, so I would like to see teaching within the university reviewed.
1:51:14
I think teaching in a broader sense to people coming in to the Andrews like
1:51:19
public groups and school groups and things like that, that’s great right now.
1:51:24
But I don’t think we view ourselves as teachers in the university setting.
1:51:28
How do you compare it to say Oakridge and Tennessee?
1:51:32
Same general problem.
1:51:33
I think they face the same problem.
1:51:35
I don’t see any of those programs that have taken on a major teaching
1:51:43
leadership within the university.
1:51:44
I could be wrong, but I haven’t seen anything that just says, “Now
1:51:47
that’s what we should do like!”
1:51:50
Are there any reasons why the group hasn’t consciously moved more strongly
1:51:53
in that direction in the past?
1:51:54
It doesn’t receive any direct support to do that.
1:52:00
It gets support to do research, and then to transfer findings from that research.
1:52:16
The most notable exceptions are the R.E.U. [NSF’s Research Experience for
1:52:21
Undergraduates] program and the IGERT [NSF’s Integrative Graduate Education
1:52:24
and Research Traineeships] program that Julia [Jones] just recently got.
1:52:27
Those kinds of programs do have an educational mission and it’s a program
1:52:32
funded with an educational mission.
1:52:36
But even in both of those cases, its educational mission is to give research
1:52:41
opportunities, not to teach classes.
1:52:46
Even in recognizing an educational mission, it’s kind
1:52:49
of a research application.
1:52:51
And maybe that’s exactly the way it should be.
1:52:54
This issue is just right off the top of my head, just something I’ve
1:52:56
been mulling over the last year.
1:53:00
That I’m not sure that we recognize the educational side, and I’m not sure
1:53:06
that those of us that are paid to teach in the university have done a good
1:53:13
job of inviting others into that role.
1:53:18
We have them give guest lectures and things like that.
1:53:24
Fred has taught some classes.
1:53:26
He’s taught Forest Geomorphology.
1:53:27
He was actually the one who got that started originally.
1:53:31
But, by-and-large, people in those research positions aren’t paid to
1:53:37
teach classes, and their performance evaluations aren’t made on the
1:53:42
contribution they make to teaching.
1:53:45
It’s a bit of a challenge, so I’m struggling.
1:53:47
I’m trying to figure out how we could have the academic side of the university
1:53:53
be more central in what we do as an LTER site, where it’s a collaboration between
1:54:01
the Forest Service and the university.
1:54:02
Are there any guidelines from LTER and NSF on that?
1:54:07
Not other than to stimulate research and opportunities
1:54:13
and information for education.
1:54:17
Like I say, it’s just something I’ve been grappling with, but I notice
1:54:21
it from a personal side when I feel that my responsibilities to teaching
1:54:27
are not valued or recognized, you know, it’s just kind of a hindrance.
1:54:33
Then somebody may say, “Well, wait a minute.
1:54:34
What does that say about us as a program?” Maybe it’s just a little bit
1:54:37
of over-sensitivity on my part, but it’s making me think about it either way.
1:54:44
And
1:54:46
I would say it in a positive way, it’s kind of like we’re always looking for
1:54:51
ways that our program can grow and become better, and I think this might be one.
1:54:55
I’ve got to think about it some.
1:54:58
Several people have mentioned the
1:55:02
Andrews group is in some ways not as visible as it could be on
1:55:05
campus, that people don’t know about it and what’s been accomplished.
1:55:09
Having
1:55:16
FSL as a center.
1:55:19
[Forestry Sciences Lab, a U.S. Forest Service research facility] Many LTER
1:55:20
sites would give their eyeteeth to have a central facility so close to campus,
1:55:25
because they’re spread among multiple campuses and they have a hell of a time
1:55:28
just getting a committee meeting together.
1:55:30
Here we’ve got them right on the periphery of campus.
1:55:35
Yet, as a result of that, it’s not the same as if they were right in the heart
1:55:39
of campus, so there was that visibility.
1:55:40
I mean they can go through a year of doing a lot of great work, and the only time
1:55:45
they’ll be on campus is to get a sandwich at the MU or pick up some supplies.
1:55:50
That’s a little bit harsh.
1:55:51
I don’t mean that the way it sounds, but it is a bit peripheral.
1:55:56
And when we have meetings, it’s over there, and so all of us at campus, go to
1:56:00
the edge of campus for an LTER meeting.
1:56:04
Maybe we need to think about that part of visibility is just being there.
1:56:11
If we had some of our activities
1:56:15
in the heart of campus, then people would see us, and people that are
1:56:20
on the edge would feel like they’re part of the campus, as opposed to
1:56:24
conveniently located on the perimeter.
1:56:28
Were you ever located in that building over there?
1:56:29
Uh-uh [negative].
1:56:30
Always over here?
1:56:31
Always over
1:56:35
here.
1:56:37
Like I say, luckily, if that’s as bad as our problems get,
1:56:41
we’ll be quite fortunate, indeed.
1:56:45
Still, compared to many programs, we’ve got very close ties and
1:56:48
high visibility in the university compared to some LTER operations.
1:56:52
But, at the same time I think there’s some opportunity for improvement in that area.
1:56:59
Well I better let you get to work here.
1:57:01
I appreciate your time.
