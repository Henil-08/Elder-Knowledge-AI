00:01
This is an interview with Robert Griffiths, taking place on
00:05
Thursday, the 6th of November, 1997.
00:09
The place of the interview is Dr. Griffiths’ office at the Forest
00:13
Science Laboratory [U.S. Forest Service] in Corvallis Oregon.
00:15
The interviewer is Max Geier, and the time of the interview
00:17
is 1 o’clock in the afternoon.
00:34
What I’ve been trying to start out with each person I interview, is I ask
00:39
if you could just talk a little bit about your personal background, how you
00:43
came to be involved with the Andrews Forest, where you were before you
00:49
were at OSU, and how you would like to
00:55
define your work.
00:55
Let’s see.
00:55
I
01:00
came to Oregon State in ‘68, got a Ph.D. here in ‘72, and have
01:06
been here ever since, working in different capacities, primarily in
01:11
the Department of Microbiology, about 22 years, or something like that.
01:19
About 10 or 11 years ago, Kermit Cromack, in this department, came to me, saying
01:25
that he has this new system to look at these mycorrhizal mats of forest soil.
01:32
My training was in
01:36
microbiology, biochemistry and oceanography, and I was actually
01:41
an oceanographer at the time.
01:44
I spent about the first 12 years of my career as an oceanographer.
01:49
He said, “Hey, this is a neat system over here.” Funding was getting tough
01:54
in oceanography, so I said, “What the heck, we’ll take a look at forest
01:58
soils!” And I guess the rest is history.
02:00
I moved over here in ‘92, so I’ve been here for about five- and-a-half
02:06
years, or something like that.
02:08
Up until that time, you hadn’t really done much with the Andrews, before ‘92?
02:12
No, no, no.
02:13
I started out, actually, about ‘86 or ’87, doing some work at both the Andrews
02:22
and Mary’s Peak, working on these mats, continued on mats for a number of years,
02:27
and kind of branched out into ozone.
02:32
Actually, I think it was probably ‘87 when I first started doing work on the Andrews.
02:40
What drew you up there?
02:42
It was a neat place to work on these mycorrhizal mats.
02:47
Were there other people doing work in that area?
02:51
Well, actually there was another thing going on as well about the same time.
02:57
It was the same year, ‘86, that Steve Carpenter, who was in this
03:02
department as a mycologist, and who is now working for Hewlett Packard
03:07
making a real living for himself.
03:11
[Laughs]
03:13
Welcome to Oregon Higher Education!
03:14
Yeah,
03:17
he got tired of the soft-money game like all the rest of us out here.
03:24
Anyhow, he got me interested in the log decomposition project.
03:26
Of course, Mark Harmon was in charge of that.
03:29
It was
03:34
actually Mark that got me involved.
03:35
So, at the same time I first started working on mats, I was
03:41
working on this log decomp project.
03:46
It was within six months of when they cut the logs.
03:51
We did studies on respiration and nitrogen fixation in those logs,
03:56
and that work continues today.
04:02
Those were my first contacts.
04:04
It
04:07
was maybe only a year after that, probably ’88,
04:15
that they had an REU program going on at the Andrews.
04:19
The whole program was about 10 students each summer, and I got involved doing
04:24
that as a mentor, and helped out on that.
04:28
And I have repeated with that ever since.
04:31
Can you back up
04:44
a little bit here?
04:45
I’m interested in some of your academic roots and your mentors.
04:50
I mean, what brought you towards microbiology?
04:54
Okay.
04:54
Are you originally from California?
04:56
No, I was originally from Ohio, and
05:00
ended up going
05:05
to Oberlin [College] . Got into biology as a pre-med student.
05:12
I was in pre-med at Oberlin, and
05:18
I was about ready to get drafted, and went into the Navy [laughs] after that.
05:24
I was a naval officer for about three-and-a-half years.
05:28
You were doing what?
05:29
I was a naval officer for three-and-a-half years.
05:34
Didn’t do any science
05:38
while I was there.
05:38
[Laughs] In any event, I got out and started pushing drugs for
05:42
a pharmaceutical company for a short while, and just hated that.
05:48
I was also interested in biology, but I never could remember all the plant names
05:53
though, so most everything in biology when I went through Oberlin, was slanted
05:58
towards taxonomy and descriptives, and there was very little physiology
06:04
and that sort of thing going on.
06:08
When I started getting back into it, I discovered that there were lots
06:12
of these neat things happening in the field of biology, things were
06:15
just turning around literally, so you could make it as a biologist and
06:20
not remember all the plant names.
06:25
Late ‘60’s?
06:27
Mid ‘60’s.
06:28
I went to San Jose State in ‘66 and finished my degree there
06:37
in ‘68.
06:38
Actually,
06:41
I was either going to go into entomology or microbiology, and this one new
06:46
faculty member was a microbiologist.
06:48
He was anxious to start with a graduate student, so he took me under his wing,
06:54
and he was a marine microbiologist.
06:58
His mentor actually was Dick Morita, who is on the faculty here, an
07:03
emeritus professor in microbiology.
07:06
Who’s the guy you were working with?
07:08
Working with at that point?
07:12
Dr. H-A-I-G-H-T,
07:17
and I did a thesis
07:24
on marine organisms, factors involved in
07:30
what happens to them when they get heated up.
07:35
Anyhow, it was a sort of zoological type work on these marine microorganisms.
07:40
I applied to Oregon State, was accepted, came up here, and worked
07:46
with his mentor, Dick Morita, who was also in marine microbiology.
07:52
I continued on essentially straight
07:57
physiological studies,
08:00
photo-effects on the
08:05
shifts in catabolic pathways to glucose metabolism,
08:14
showing that there was a basic shift from one pathway to another, depending upon
08:19
shifts in salinity in marine organisms.
08:21
So
08:23
your move up to OSU, was because of the mentor relationship, or because
08:27
of OSU’s reputation in oceanography?
08:30
Basically, just kind of came here because it seemed like a
08:33
good idea and deal at the time.
08:36
[Laughs] And because my mentor down there said, “Hey, you’d really
08:42
like it up in Corvallis, and you shouldn’t have any problem getting
08:46
in.” That’s how I moved up here.
08:49
Had you been here before at all?
08:51
No, no, no.
08:54
My wife and I were living in California at that point, and we moved up here in ‘68.
09:01
I’m kind of curious of the connections between oceanography, [fungal]
09:08
mats, and log decomposition.
09:10
How did that transition take place?
09:17
When you’re looking at carbon and nitrogen cycling, like I’ve done in
09:21
a marine environment, most of the work I did there I did in the poles.
09:24
I worked in the Antarctic and the Arctic
09:31
for most of that time.
09:32
Anyhow, the processes are essentially the same.
09:35
It doesn’t make a difference, if it is forest soils or marine sediments
09:37
or logs or whatever, the same sorts of chemical cycles take place,
09:44
there are just different factors involved, and slightly different
09:49
actors involved [laughs] in terms of who does what, but
09:53
these things happen everywhere.
09:55
And they are real basic biochemical transformations, and you pretty
10:00
much move from one field to another, studying the same types of things.
10:06
But, just having to deal with a whole new literature, it was a pretty giant jump,
10:12
going from oceanography to forest science.
10:18
It’s interesting though, that I am supposed to be making my living as a
10:24
microbial ecologist studying in forest soils, because I never had any formal
10:28
training in either forestry or soils.
10:31
[Laughs]
10:31
Was
10:35
there much connection between people like Dick Morita and Forest Science?
10:39
No.
10:39
None at all.
10:41
The only initial contact was,
10:46
and for different reasons, was Steve Carpenter, who happened to run
10:51
into a colleague of mine, they got talking, and we all got together.
10:57
It seemed like a kind of neat thing to do.
10:59
I got involved in a lot of projects, and then, Kermit Cromack approached
11:02
us about how he knew we were working on nutrient-cycling, and that there
11:09
was potential for interesting things that could be studied in the soil mats
11:18
or bio maps.
11:18
Was it all in the literature?
11:25
No.
11:27
We just knew each other and kept talking, and mutual contacts.
11:34
Also, another interesting thing.
11:40
Dick Waring had asked me, and I don’t remember how this started, but
11:43
he wanted me to evaluate a thesis a student of his had done, looking at
11:52
starch
11:55
buildup in fine roots, and how physiology of trees influenced that, soil-tree
12:04
interactions, that sort of thing.
12:07
That was another connection.
12:08
All of these happened about the same time, all independent of one another.
12:12
Like it was meant to be.
12:15
I guess it was meant to be.
12:19
Were there any
12:22
particular models that you relied on as you were developing your career,
12:31
first in oceanography, and then as you moved into soil cycles?
12:33
Anybody that you worked for or whose thoughts were really enlightening?
12:40
Well,
12:43
I guess the model that I was following was that of my mentor, Dick Morita,
12:47
because he was one of the very early people in marine microbiology
12:52
that was looking at processes and
12:56
the biochemistry of what’s going on, rather than just descriptive
13:01
microbiology.
13:02
You know, what’s there, and what we can isolate.
13:05
He was one of the first ones looking at the effects of pressure on cells
13:13
and enzymes, and the effects of starvation and the effect of heating;
13:19
all these things on marine organisms.
13:26
I was interested in how these organisms functioned.
13:31
Most of the work he did was in the laboratory.
13:33
He did very physiological, classic work, using marine organisms.
13:40
I was a lot more interested in going out and actually doing things in the field.
13:46
Initially, I got into it because there was money available to work
13:52
in the Antarctic on this project.
13:55
They said, “What do you think,” and I said, “Sure, what the heck, I’ll try it.”
13:59
That was while you were up here
14:03
at OSU?
14:05
I had virtually no training in ecology.
14:09
It’s
14:19
all been kind of picked up, learned the hard way, along the way.
14:23
But you had a field orientation early on as a student?
14:30
Yeah, I worked all over Alaska, parts of Canada, all over the Chukchi
14:38
Sea, Beaufort Sea, Norton Sound and the Aleutians, and all the way
14:45
down to Seattle, along the coast.
14:48
It’s been pretty neat.
14:49
Most of the funding was from NOAA, the National Oceanographic
14:52
and Atmospheric Administration.
14:53
They had
15:03
a huge project to look at the effects of offshore drilling on marine systems.
15:10
We were particularly interested in what the effects of crude oil might be on
15:16
microbial processes in offshore and nearshore environments, so we spent
15:22
a lot of time on ships, and a lot of time out in marine labs up there.
15:31
That work continued through the early ‘80’s, starting
15:43
in ‘75.
15:45
When you made the transition from oceanography to forest soils,
15:50
what do you recollect about your first actual involvement on
15:55
the Andrews?
15:57
The first time actually out there, I went out to look for sites
16:03
where we could try these mats we were interested in working on.
16:09
I went with this silviculturist, Vince Puleo.
16:18
Apparently, he’s still employed with the Willamette National Forest in Eugene.
16:24
I don’t remember exactly what he is doing now, but he was the silviculturist for the
16:30
Blue River Ranger District at the time.
16:36
He took me out and showed me some spots, and
16:42
after that, we collaborated on putting together a two-day
16:46
workshop on soil biology for
16:51
employees of the Willamette National Forest.
16:56
That was one of my early involvements.
16:58
Then, I
17:01
was involved in the wood decomp study sites.
17:06
So, we went out and did some limited fieldwork there, but mostly working
17:12
on the materials they brought back to
17:22
the lab.
17:22
Then, I had involvement with the students working there as well.
17:26
So, it wasn’t until probably ’88
17:33
or ‘89 that I really got out there working
17:41
at a much more involved level.
17:44
It was about that time, I was starting to get a little bit of
17:47
funding, actually from the LTER group.
17:51
So, what I did was set up 20 sites, permanent sites on the Andrews,
17:59
kind of reference sites, for below-ground work.
18:03
Nothing like that had been done before.
18:04
We had reference bands that had been in place for forty or fifty years,
18:10
looking at growth rates and the rest of it, vegetation, but there was
18:14
nothing set up for below ground.
18:18
We wanted to be able to set up places where we could go in and disturb the
18:22
soils, and not disturb some other place.
18:25
That’s why we’ve been going the way of regional reference bands, and also,
18:28
I wanted to put together a different kind of design which would give us a
18:36
broad climatic range, so we could look at the effects of climate on soil
18:44
processes on a monthly time status.
18:50
We did that, and studied those sites for a number of years,
18:56
and we have since expanded those sites to about 24, I think it is.
19:02
Where we are in addition to looking at variability in climate, we are
19:07
also looking at effects of harvesting.
19:11
So, we’ve been comparing clear cuts, a young stand, 30-35 years old, and old
19:23
growth, in the same general area, and looking at seasonal differences, comparing
19:29
levels, what’s going on below ground.
19:31
And in each of those sites, we have ten stations or locations
19:36
that we keep using in the sample.
19:40
Those are all in the Andrews?
19:41
They are all in the Andrews.
19:44
Then, a couple years after that, ’93 I guess it was,
19:51
I established a set of almost 200 sites, 184 sites, at
19:56
half-kilometer intervals along
20:01
roads all over the Andrews, and those have been well-documented.
20:03
We use those for studies, and we will continue to use those
20:08
for kind of large-scale studies on the whole-basin level/scale.
20:17
Do you have students working with you?
20:19
Who’s setting up these sites?
20:22
Mostly undergraduate students
20:26
and money from REU projects, from the LTER program, volunteers,
20:33
work study, whatever I can get.
20:37
Typically, I’ll have four students a year in the summer, working on these
20:45
projects, but then, when we get REU students, we’ll get everybody involved.
20:48
We’ll get fifteen people
20:53
out there.
20:53
That’s kind of ongoing.
20:55
I’ve also set up a real intensive plot where we have got
21:02
GIS overlays of everything that’s out there.
21:06
And this is again, part of the network that I’ve tried to establish
21:10
for ongoing below-ground work.
21:17
I’ve had a lot of interest from people looking at insects, and fungal genetics.
21:25
A bunch of other folks are wanting to use the sites.
21:33
So, I’ve actually got sites for three different scales for different purposes.
21:43
So that’s kind of my ongoing legacy of work, along with posting data.
21:53
People working with entomologists and fungal groups are working on it?
22:01
At this point, the people that have only
22:05
shown an interest, haven’t done anything, but are very
22:08
much interested in pursuing it.
22:09
One is Joey Spatafora in the Botany Department here [OSU] . We plan on doing a
22:17
collaborative project starting next year.
22:21
There is also a scientist with the National Biological Service
22:30
in Seattle, who has expressed interest in doing genetic work there as well.
22:38
There have been a number of entomologists, Andy Moldenke being one.
22:46
There have been some entomologists from U of O that have approached
22:50
me about using those sites for their entomological studies.
23:01
I guess the next thing we are putting together, is sites that we will be using
23:05
for LTER 4 to study stands that have different successional trajectories.
23:15
They have been cut and they are either coming [tree establishment]
23:17
along really slow or really fast.
23:17
We are going to try and determine, what is cause and what is effect.
23:24
In other words, are there things in the soil that would cause the
23:28
site to have a predisposition to be a fast site or a slow site?
23:36
Once we do have a number of sites on the Andrews, particularly in
23:42
high, south-facing slopes where very little [tree] regeneration is
23:49
taking place, and very, very slowly.
23:52
And we would like to determine what that translates into in terms of
23:59
effects on biology and chemistry, nutrient-cycling, rates of carbon
24:05
and nitrogen-cycling, and such.
24:08
Like the one you were talking about at the Andrews days [“HJA Daze” – annual public
24:08
event to show work and programs] up there?
24:11
Yeah.
24:12
How
24:21
would you characterize your understanding of the purpose of an experimental
24:24
forest since you started working out there, and how much exposure
24:27
had you had to that as a concept?
24:31
I can’t say that it was much different than what has turned
24:38
out to be the reality of it.
24:39
It was obvious it was a place where there was a lot of
24:44
multi-disciplinary research going on.
24:46
I might preface this to say that I was actually going to meetings for LTER,
24:52
before I had done much work out there.
24:54
So, very early on, I had a pretty good sense of what was going on in
24:58
terms of who the players were and how people interacted and worked in
25:02
kind of a multi-disciplinary way.
25:05
I think fairly early on, it was obvious that one of the main advantages was
25:09
that you had, was long-term records of management and a bunch of other records;
25:17
climate data and data on other subjects.
25:20
This was before Steve Carpenter [contacted you]
25:23
? Well, I never heard of it before him!
25:28
Experimental forest, what was that?
25:32
[Laughs] They cut trees, I guess.
25:34
I didn’t have a clue!
25:40
Actually,
25:46
those were my same feelings before I started working in this department.
25:47
So, you started going to the LTER meetings after the Andrews folks contacted
25:50
you to find out more about your work before you got into the actual work?
25:54
No, it was clear that this was going to potentially be an
25:59
interesting way to go early on.
26:04
We got very neat results really fast, it was obvious,
26:11
and we got funding right away.
26:14
The first proposal we put into the USDA Competitive Grants, got
26:21
funded.
26:22
It was unbelievable.
26:26
So, we had the money to get started, and that was the thing that really
26:35
made us go in that direction.
26:36
If there was no money, we wouldn’t have begun.
26:40
So, it was obvious this was where all the action was, where all the
26:48
movers and shakers were, and I wanted to be in the middle of it,
26:51
so I started going to the meetings and participating the best I could.
26:58
From what you said, it sounds like you were attracted, at least in part, by the
27:02
promise of multi-disciplinary potential?
27:06
Yeah, and the working relationships.
27:09
It was obvious that the rapport
27:13
people had with one another, even outside the college and the university, was great.
27:19
They had people here from the Forest Service, and
27:25
there was no distinction about organizations, but it was, what you
27:30
can do, a “we will work together” type of approach, which was
27:34
unusual at the time, unfortunately.
27:38
I wanted to ask you about, actually, the kind of
27:41
inter-disciplinary potential at OSU.
27:44
Do you find that characteristic of the university in general,
27:47
or primarily with this group?
27:50
I think it’s pretty unusual
27:54
overall in science.
27:58
In oceanography, there was a different kind of rapport.
28:02
It was an “old boys club,” pretty much. You either went to Scripps or you went to
28:06
Woods Hole, and if you didn’t go to either one, you were pretty much out of it.
28:14
You go on a cruise, it would be intense interdisciplinary activity because that is
28:20
the only way you could function, really.
28:23
But speaking as a biologist,
28:28
it wasn’t like it was all one campus, or there was a center, or a place.
28:32
It was folks from all over the United States that flew in, maybe from all over
28:36
the world, to some port, you got on a ship and went out and did your science, came
28:41
back, and all went your different ways.
28:42
You got together for a meeting once a year and called it good.
28:47
That is the way things typically happened in that field.
28:52
That’s the only thing that I can really speak to.
28:54
I think in a lot of other fields that I have been associated with, people are so
29:00
concerned with covering their backsides, they are not very forthcoming about
29:06
what they are doing, and are not terribly cooperative, overall.
29:12
But the attitude is totally different here.
29:15
It’s not universal in this field, believe me.
29:19
All you have to do is look at UW and other places.
29:24
This is very, very unusual.
29:27
You’re talking about the university now?
29:31
I’m talking about the LTER group specifically, and in a lot of ways,
29:36
the Department of Forest Science [OSU] , because that is pretty much
29:39
the way people operate around here.
29:42
But
29:45
in the Cascade Center [for Ecosystem Management] , or the
29:47
LTER, however you want to define it,
29:52
it’s unique that not only are scientists talking with each other,
29:58
but people are actively managing the forest, from the Blue River District.
30:04
They’re constantly working with these folks and sharing information,
30:10
and that is really unique as well.
30:14
So, it’s not only unique in terms of size, it is also unique in terms of
30:20
the interaction between the people that are practicing forest science.
30:25
Who at the district have you worked most closely, that you have been involved with?
30:29
John Cissel, Lynn Burditt, and
30:44
a number of other people I’ve had interactions with over the years.
30:47
But typically, it’s just that I have a certain thing that I need to find out, or
30:54
I know this person will do it, and that’s it.
30:57
So, there hasn’t been much in terms of one-on-one, long-term
31:06
kind of concerted effort in any given area, from myself, personally.
31:11
I was just contacted by their soil scientist, who is new out there,
31:15
at the Blue River Ranger District.
31:21
It looks like he is interested in cooperating, and so we
31:24
are beginning to go, but,
31:29
I guess that would be it.
31:32
Mostly with John [Cissel] ; he’s kind of been the liaison.
31:38
I haven’t been very much involved in things that are directly related to
31:42
some of the management things they have been doing, or some of the tests
31:46
that they have specifically laid out.
31:48
So, I haven’t had really a need to do that.
31:49
When you work down there, do you typically go down there and stay for a period, or do
31:56
you go down there and come back in the same day?
31:59
I usually go down
32:03
and spend a night, at least.
32:05
Rarely will I be there more than 2 or 3 days, although if this LTER program
32:12
or the REU program gets funded, I am supposed to be running that show, so I
32:20
will be spending more time down there.
32:23
Quite a bit more time.
32:24
I have always had a lot of folks working down there full-time.
32:29
I have had students there, and had one student that was there for a
32:34
full year, but typically, I only go in for a couple of days at the most.
32:38
Do you stay
32:41
at the headquarters site then?
32:42
Yes.
32:42
If you could, talk a little about what your resource or facility needs are
32:51
on-site there for the kind of research you do, and how the availability of
32:55
those resources is changing over time.
32:59
They are just like night and day.
33:01
[Laughs] I had nothing to begin with.
33:02
We have had a couple of old broken-down trailers, and I had
33:09
what they were calling labs.
33:14
It was beat up old trailers, these two benches and almost no equipment.
33:20
I had a muffle furnace and a top-loading scale, which is
33:24
about all I remember being there.
33:26
And I never used any of that stuff.
33:31
We brought everything back to Corvallis to work on.
33:36
Packed up sample bags?
33:37
Yes, everything was brought back.
33:39
We didn’t do anything out there except maybe measuring temperature.
33:47
That was it.
33:52
When the lab was built,
33:55
I started really hustling and getting
34:00
a lot of equipment for the two labs, and I ended up occupying those first two labs.
34:06
But, also, I found somebody that was surplusing a still, and I got that
34:13
installed, and somebody else surplused a real nice, almost brand new autoclave.
34:19
Got that installed.
34:21
There was another big,
34:24
huge drying oven, the size of a small room.
34:30
We surplused that and got it shipped out there.
34:36
EPA was going to throw out some incredibly expensive ion-exchange
34:42
units for purifying water.
34:43
Got that shipped out there.
34:47
One scientist here was retiring and he wanted to know if
34:51
I wanted his refrigerated centrifuge, a $16,000 centrifuge.
34:55
I said, “I’ll take it.” It’s out there.
34:58
We scrounged up enough, and then got funds to buy a
35:03
chromatograph, which is out there.
35:07
I am almost as well-equipped out there as I am here.
35:12
We do a lot of stuff out there; enzyme
35:17
assays, gas exchange work, nitrogen fixation, respiration, all those things.
35:23
We got a couple of incubators there,
35:28
a spectrometer, and
35:31
pH meters.
35:35
All kinds of good equipment.
35:36
Almost all of it, I’ve scrounged from some place.
35:39
That takes up a lot of space.
35:41
Is there any kind of administrative structure to decide how space is allocated
35:48
out there?
35:48
I mean, are you involved in that decision-making process?
35:48
If there’s a void, we
35:56
fill it.
35:57
Except for the communal stuff, which is useful for everybody, like
36:02
the autoclave and the rest of it.
36:08
With those exceptions, everything else that I have hauled up
36:12
there is in those two labs.
36:15
I have primarily taken
36:19
those.
36:19
If other people that need to use those labs, is there a system for that?
36:24
Or is that pretty much set aside for you work?
36:26
No, but the equipment is expensive enough and finicky enough that I
36:32
like to have them contact me and find out who is going to use it.
36:37
I try to make the equipment as available as I can, but of course,
36:41
there is stuff that could get
36:44
damaged.
36:45
If someone doesn’t use the centrifuge right, you could tear up that
36:48
whole lab, kill people, big-time.
36:52
So, we do have to restrict it, and there are balances that are
36:56
very expensive, and you could just walk out the door with them.
37:01
I assume that falls under administrative responsibility.
37:03
Do you maintain control over that?
37:05
Well, that’s an area that we haven’t really sorted that out as neatly
37:10
as I’d liked to, at this point.
37:11
And that is something we have got to put together, some more
37:16
specific policies in my view.
37:17
And we will, it will just have to happen.
37:21
There are certain things that are very high maintenance things, as well.
37:24
So, we will have to get someone, either to pay for supplies or pay for maintenance.
37:34
But generally, I try to make things as available as I can to students.
37:38
I mean that’s what it’s out there for.
37:41
But of course, I don’t want to go out there and have a piece of equipment
37:44
all “boogered up,” then and have to pay, and not be able to use it.
37:48
I’m trying to get a little sense of the concepts of use of the facilities.
37:53
Do you agree on some of these
37:57
things out there?
37:58
Actually, I just sent them a memo on lab safety which we
38:02
wanted to have people sign.
38:05
Before, there was hardly any lab work going on, so it was not an issue, but
38:10
it is becoming more and more an issue.
38:13
I put together a whole series of
38:18
safety guidelines, and also
38:28
recommendations of how to deal with equipment issues and so forth.
38:32
It is going to be more of a problem now that we have teaching labs out there.
38:36
That’s going to be incredible.
38:39
You talk about future potential of that new facility, with a teaching lab.
38:46
That is going to be just dynamite.
38:47
Because right now, about 80% of the research that goes on out there, takes
38:52
place three months of the summer.
38:55
The rest of the time it is pretty seriously underutilized.
38:58
That is my impression, anyways.
39:00
That is
39:03
the time when classes from OSU and other colleges and universities in the
39:09
Willamette Valley could be using that as a teaching facility, and I would like to
39:13
be using it for workshops and so forth.
39:16
Right now, we have no money for equipment.
39:19
Once we do get equipment, we’ll have to be over there, and manage that as well.
39:24
We’ll have microscopes and sound systems that are
39:27
available.
39:27
There will be a more formalized policy on the management of those things?
39:34
Of how to deal with the equipment and so on.
39:36
Do you think that you all could work that out?
39:40
Well, that is something that I would work out with Art, and
39:47
with the manager that I’d be
39:51
hiring.
39:53
Also, Al [Levno] , of course, is involved in the use of the equipment.
39:57
Generally, just four or five of us will get around a table
40:01
and try to hash something out.
40:02
It usually works.
40:03
And if there are any problems that any people have, they
40:07
just bring it to whoever?
40:08
Yeah.
40:16
I wanted to ask you
40:23
what
40:27
parts of the Andrews you might identify as your most important
40:32
worksites.
40:32
Also, who apart from the Andrews group, you would consider at this
40:35
point to be your closest colleagues?
40:43
Outside of the Andrews.
40:56
Almost all of them are associated with the Andrews in one way or another.
40:59
Actually, I retired a year ago,
41:05
but you
41:07
wouldn’t know it.
41:09
I had no idea!
41:09
I wouldn’t know it either!
41:09
But what that has meant is that I’ve purposely kind of
41:17
disassociated myself from a lot of
41:30
my peripheral contacts.
41:31
My main interests at this point, are for the foreseeable future, to
41:36
continue work at the Andrews, and for that reason, most of my current
41:41
and future contacts are going to be people working out there, although I
41:48
have certainly worked with many other people on different projects and have
41:52
had students working different places.
41:58
What is it at this point about the Andrews that kind of keeps you involved,
42:00
even though you are officially retired?
42:04
Well, I think it is
42:09
a great tool for education.
42:12
I really enjoy working with undergrads.
42:16
I just think that it is an incredible
42:20
teaching tool.
42:23
Also, I enjoy working with practicing foresters, so when we have extension
42:32
stuff or workshop things, I think that’s incredibly important as well, and it’s
42:39
just a different kind of educational role.
42:42
And when we get that teaching lab up, that’s going to be outstanding.
42:47
I think it is important because of the integrated research going on out there.
42:55
I think that there are a lot of interesting people,
43:00
a lot of dynamics involved.
43:07
Where I would like to go professionally,
43:11
would best be pursued through the Andrews because of the people involved,
43:19
primarily, and because it is a great resource.
43:21
It is an area I know very well now, and we have a very strong data base that
43:30
we are building on, and it’s the fact that we are building on a database
43:32
that will be available a decade, fifty, or maybe one hundred years from now.
43:36
People will go back to these spots and they will be able to make measurements
43:39
after the climate has warmed up
43:43
[much laughter], and the trees have been replaced by palm
43:45
trees out here in the quad,
43:52
and then grow up and study the soils out there and see what
43:54
it was like 100 years ago.
43:57
And go to the exact spot where we have very accurate
44:02
sightings in terms of where we are using satellites and such.
44:07
So anyhow, it’s
44:10
building a scientific legacy.
44:12
I think it is very
44:15
important.
44:15
I think another issue that certainly keeps me involved, and I have been in it
44:21
long enough that I can make a difference.
44:25
I know how it works.
44:26
I know the people.
44:28
It’s a mix in which I know the territory and I know the people, and so,
44:38
a lot of time that you spend spinning your wheels, generally, trying to get
44:43
new places to study and good people to collaborate with, is already taken
44:47
care of, its already there in place.
44:51
It’s just a matter of maintaining that.
44:51
So, it is very, very attractive from that aspect.
44:54
What I
44:57
would like to do, is continue to develop the database that will be used to produce
45:04
models, predictive models of climate change and disturbance, and be able
45:12
to scale these things out, eventually up to a regional level, but certainly
45:16
over a large watershed level, to make predictions as to what will happen
45:25
with soil processes, what is going on below ground; how below ground functions,
45:30
how the soils in the below-ground processes are going to be altered if
45:34
you warm up the temperature, you cool it down, or have a fire, or do whatever we
45:39
do, have large patches or small patches.
45:43
I’m interested in edge effects.
45:45
We have studies on edge effects, so the scale of things becomes very important.
45:54
These are all things that can be very nicely done on the Andrews, most of them.
45:59
Things like fire might go off-hand.
46:01
But still, you are working with the same cast of characters, you’re still
46:04
pretty much in the same ranger district,
46:08
you know how to interact with these folks, and if you need
46:10
something, you know where to get the information and how to get help.
46:17
That is going to keep my plate full as long as I want to work.
46:23
Where you’re sitting
46:26
at the top scale, you’re not tied to the Andrews?
46:28
It is a large enough chunk of land of wide enough
46:35
climatic
46:38
gradient, that it is really nicely representative, certainly
46:42
of the Central Cascades.
46:44
So, it is a nice representation of a fairly important block of forest,
46:51
certainly across Oregon, and probably
46:56
in what is going on up into Washington as well.
47:00
Perhaps up into B.C.
47:04
That is representative of a big chunk of real estate.
47:09
If
47:12
you look at a continuum in terms of the drainage, we’ve got the headwaters of a
47:18
chunk of the McKenzie drainage, and one of the things I am interested in is fine
47:26
organic material in stream sediments.
47:28
That is another area that I want to become involved in.
47:30
We can do that nicely on the Andrews because we have a large
47:34
enough spot that we’ve got first-
47:39
to fifth-order streams there to study, and it is part of a much
47:45
larger watershed that a fair amount of information is known about.
47:49
So,
47:52
it is useful from that aspect.
47:54
It is also useful in another way.
47:56
I have used regional studies where I’ll have sites on the Andrews, and
48:01
know the history of those sites, and we can compare what is going on there,
48:06
using exactly the same approach in other areas with the same kind of
48:10
measurements, same everything else.
48:14
We can go look and compare what is going on elsewhere in the
48:19
study with a known quantity.
48:21
So,
48:24
it can act like a reference site for larger studies.
48:34
Sounds like the work that you are doing, the way it seems to be proceeding
48:38
is, there can be people coming in from elsewhere, but because of what’s
48:41
happening on the Andrews, they can apply it, perhaps, more broadly
48:44
in British Columbia or Washington?
48:51
I think that is where we are heading in the future.
48:53
There is some of that going on.
48:56
There are people from all over the United States that work at the Andrews,
49:00
and there are actually a few studies, like the LIDET studies [Long-term
49:04
Inter-site Litter Decomposition Experiment Team study] that Mark Harmon does.
49:06
I don’t know if you’ve talked with Mark?
49:09
But that is a good example, as he looked at decomposition rates
49:13
all over the United States.
49:13
In that case, the
49:18
Andrews is an important part of that.
49:22
There is another study that is starting up now that is actually being conducted
49:26
by folks here at OSU, that is designed after a similar study that we have done
49:33
on hardwood forests from other places.
49:41
Similarly, Stan Gregory has got things going on that are playing
49:47
off of and coordinating with people from Coweeta and other LTER sites.
49:56
So, there is definitely interest, a push on doing inter-site work within the LTER
50:09
network.
50:10
There is also some interest internationally with the Chinese,
50:13
the Russians, and some others.
50:15
But I have not been directly involved with any of those projects.
50:19
I have done some work here in Alaska and in Georgia, looking at
50:25
mycorrhizal mats, comparing those.
50:27
But, that is the only kind of comparative work other than my own work, with this
50:32
regional study stuff, that I have done.
50:35
But, that is clearly where the Andrews is headed, where the LTER group is headed.
50:42
And if Congress does come in with some more funding, they did come in with a
50:51
request, almost doubling the funding to some of the sites, and we weren’t
50:58
chosen, unfortunately, but that was where the thrust of that money was to go.
51:03
If, in the future, we get additional funding, that is where it is
51:09
going to go, to more regionalize what we are doing on the Andrews.
51:15
That was the whole purpose of that [new proposal] , I forgot what they called it.
51:25
It was an amendment.
51:25
Anyhow, it was essentially to
51:33
use these funds to broaden the spatial scope of what is going on at the Andrews.
51:39
Now, at the current funding level, I don’t see a lot of that happening,
51:42
because we are pretty much in a maintenance mode right now.
51:46
That half-a-million [dollars] a year sounds like a lot of money, but
51:48
it certainly doesn’t go very far.
51:52
So, we have pretty much had to hunker down and maintain what
51:56
we have got going on that scale.
52:00
Does that
52:05
answer
52:15
your question?
52:15
That was pretty good.
52:16
I was talking to other people.
52:20
Many of them come to the Andrews from
52:25
various backgrounds.
52:27
Your background is pretty much focused in your past professional career.
52:31
I mean, you got your Ph.D., and did your research in the Arctic and Antarctic.
52:39
Well, virtually all my work in oceanography was polar work.
52:43
I didn’t work here at all.
52:45
I did some work in the estuary.
52:47
Then, in terms of your forest work, it’s all based here.
52:50
Yeah,
52:53
well, with the exception of the work we did in Alaska, and then Coweeta,
52:58
and Northern California and Mexico.
53:04
Other than that it has all been here.
53:06
Mexico was the work with Mark Harmon;
53:15
termite farts,
53:20
methane from termites.
53:25
What is the impact of methane from termites?
53:27
A lot.
53:29
They produce a lot of methane.
53:32
Actually, on a global basis, it definitely is a significant portion of methane,
53:38
which is a very important greenhouse gas.
53:40
What
53:43
we discovered was, even though these things produced a lot of methane,
53:47
none of it gets out of the logs.
53:49
It gets oxidized before it gets out of the logs.
53:52
A lot of assumptions about, we’ve got these termites, they’re in logs, they’re
53:59
producing a lot of methane, therefore, you’ve got so much methane being produced,
54:03
you got so many logs, you got so many termites per log, and you multiply all
54:07
that and you get some kind of gas factory
54:14
for methane.
54:14
Well, it may not work that way
54:18
[laughs], they may be producing some methane, but it may not ever get
54:22
out in the air, and that’s one of the things that we were checking.
54:27
We checked at the Andrews, and we checked in the tropics in Mexico,
54:32
and it gave us the same answer.
54:34
Which is nothing is coming out of the log.
54:38
These termites are farting their brains out, but nothing is coming out of the log!
54:42
[Laughs]
54:50
So, you’re concerned about global warming, obviously.
54:54
It’s one thing that has been driving some of your research?
54:56
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
54:58
A lot of the work I’ve been doing was initially respiration,
55:03
forest floor respiration, CO2 coming out of the forest floor.
55:07
But in order to really understand what is going on there, you
55:10
can’t just look at that.
55:11
You have to look at everything else that is going on.
55:13
So, we started looking at dissolved organic carbons in
55:16
soils, which not many people do.
55:19
Because that is the primary currency through which the carbon has to
55:23
flow to get to the microorganisms to be blown off in the first place.
55:27
It has to be in a liquid state.
55:30
So, we looked at that.
55:31
And we’ve looked at interactions between soil and moisture
55:35
and temperature, obviously.
55:36
But then, you need to start looking at other carbon pools, so we have looked
55:42
at photo-carbons and labile carbon, and
55:48
you can’t look at this just for carbon-cycling, because nitrogen
55:50
is involved in this and is necessary, for full decomposition.
55:54
So,
55:57
we looked at de-nitrification and nitrogen [fixation] , and a bunch of other factors.
56:01
What started out as a project primarily looking at respiration, kind of snowballed
56:06
into all these kinds of things as well.
56:10
That’s kind of
56:13
how we started from this little thing and that it kind of grew up.
56:16
You talked about your interest in involving undergraduates and your teaching
56:16
role, and the workshops you put on.
56:16
Are there some
56:29
particular people you worked with closely in kind of a mentor relationship
56:32
where you brought them along, and they became involved in the Andrews, or
56:37
even people who’ve gone on elsewhere?
56:41
Well, I think so.
56:43
Most of the undergrads
56:48
I have had mentored have done
56:54
great.
56:55
In fact, I have had three of them as my own graduate students, and they
57:01
have had varying degrees of success.
57:08
I can’t quite point to any one person, but I think
57:16
what I’ve been able to do is
57:21
really give students a pretty realistic taste of what doing science is about.
57:29
Actually, going out and making measurements and all the things that are
57:34
involved, and I’ve had a number of just crackerjack students I felt had real
57:45
potential as scientists that discovered early on they don’t like the science.
57:51
That part of it wasn’t appealing to them?
57:54
Well, it’s just the reality.
57:56
It’s so much different than most of their concepts of what being a scientist
58:01
is coming in out of high school, mostly the public, they just don’t have a clue.
58:07
They just don’t have a clue!
58:10
And it sounds like a neat thing and they are interested in a science-type
58:14
of deal, but to actually do it is much different than most people realize.
58:22
And I count amongst my successes, if you can believe this or not, incredibly
58:29
bright students that have learned that this is not what they want to do, and
58:33
they have gone on to do other things.
58:35
It’s saving them, I hope, from a lot of dead ends and heartache along
58:44
the way.
58:44
[Laughs] And there are those that are good, really flourish, they love it,
58:47
and they really dig it and go for it.
58:53
That’s an interesting angle.
58:54
How would you characterize the
58:58
public view of what scientists do?
59:08
I think they
59:12
figure that it is all pretty cut-and-dried.
59:13
That
59:23
the problems are fairly simple and easily defined, that
59:29
you are able to control all of these things, do some measurements and come up
59:35
with some very nice, unequivocal findings.
59:37
And that is not
59:49
the way it works.
59:51
It’s an art form, and there are lots of really squishy things involved, and
59:57
there is a lot of flying by the seat of your pants, and there is a lot of
1:00:01
just real grunt work, a lot of real repetitive, dull, dumb stuff to do,
1:00:13
the same stuff over and over again.
1:00:18
You make mistakes and other people make mistakes that cost you more and more time.
1:00:22
It’s a real difficult, hard, frustrating process.
1:00:22
There are
1:00:30
no two ways about it.
1:00:31
It’s a lot of hard work, and it’s not cut and dried.
1:00:36
It’s
1:00:39
experience, learning from your mistakes, and looking at maybe ten
1:00:42
different ways you could go, and picking out the best way to go.
1:00:47
If you are an inexperienced person, you will go anyone of those ten ways,
1:00:50
and only one or two of them is going to get you where you want to be.
1:00:55
So, it’s a lot of stress, an incredible amount of stress, the logistics and
1:01:03
getting money and the politicking.
1:01:07
All of the stuff that is involved, there is just no way that
1:01:14
you get any of that any other way than just doing it.
1:01:19
It is not something you read about in novels, it’s not something you
1:01:22
see in movies or miniseries, or anything else, there is no way!
1:01:29
Have you had experience with certain identifying people’s
1:01:34
personality qualities, or what your ideal student might be?
1:01:48
I think I’ve got a pretty good idea.
1:01:52
Maybe I’m over-reaching myself a little bit here.
1:01:55
Number one: real bright, the brightest students I can find.
1:01:59
If I am going to take on a student, I want a student that will challenge
1:02:06
me as much as I can challenge them.
1:02:10
I want someone with a real high, native level of
1:02:18
inquisitiveness, of wanting to know, of searching, wanting to
1:02:27
learn, who is motivated, focused.
1:02:31
But yet, able to get along with people, at least in this field.
1:02:35
Probably not quite as important as other fields where you can go off in your
1:02:37
own lab, and kind of work by yourself.
1:02:37
But in
1:02:41
this field, you’ve got to work with people.
1:02:43
You have to be very effective at working with people, and interacting
1:02:49
in a positive way, give-and-take.
1:02:51
What field are you talking about here?
1:02:52
Microbiology?
1:02:56
I’m talking about ecology in general.
1:03:00
So, you can’t have someone that is a total brain,
1:03:07
and cannot function, cannot work with other people, get other people to help
1:03:15
you, or help other people as well.
1:03:21
I’ve had a lot of brainy kids that just don’t have that drive, they don’t have the
1:03:27
intellectual drive, wanting to know, or wondering why things are this way or that.
1:03:37
I look for, quite frankly, the best scientists in my
1:03:41
view, have an artistic bent.
1:03:47
They are musicians.
1:03:48
A lot of scientists are musicians, people that are poets and painters and such.
1:03:48
Because there is a lot of
1:04:00
right and left lobe involvement.
1:04:05
It’s not likely characterized by more an engineering bent where you’ve got very
1:04:12
much a lineal thinker, you’ve got so many steps, and you are going to get there.
1:04:17
Particularly in ecology, it’s parallel processing.
1:04:20
You’ve got a lot of stuff going on, you’ve got to be able to integrate
1:04:23
across a whole range of disciplines that
1:04:31
are going on.
1:04:31
You can’t go from x to y, you have to go on a lot of different
1:04:39
parallel tracks and pull a bunch of stuff together to get there.
1:04:43
You can’t get there in one straight line.
1:04:45
Does that make any sense?
1:04:47
So, when you’re picking those one or two possible ways of going that are
1:04:51
actually going to work, it takes some artistic imagination, is what you’re
1:04:55
saying, to figure out where that leads?
1:04:56
To figure out where that is, and then once you’ve started, then to be able
1:05:00
to pull in other stuff from different disciplines, to make that make sense.
1:05:09
So, it’s getting the right path to begin with, but once you start
1:05:13
down that path, you can’t just go down that path with blinders.
1:05:16
You have to go down that path by the seat-of-your-pants and pull in all
1:05:20
the information you can that seems to apply, to make any sense out of it.
1:05:26
From what you are saying, it sounds like your perception is this is something
1:05:30
that maybe, people have to bring to the discipline, it’s not something that
1:05:36
necessarily can be taught, but someone has that artistic bent before you get started?
1:05:42
Right, you learn, but if you are a straight, linear thinker, you
1:05:51
are not going to do very well.
1:05:52
[Laughs]
1:05:58
Something else here for a second that came up while you were talking,
1:06:02
especially when you were talking about things that kind of attract
1:06:05
you to working with the Andrews.
1:06:08
A lot of what you mentioned has to do with applying
1:06:15
the ideas in some kind of pragmatic form, a management
1:06:25
program.
1:06:25
I was wondering if you could talk a little about how you would
1:06:29
characterize the distinction between basic and applied research.
1:06:34
[Laughs]
1:06:34
I’m mostly interested in how you respond to that.
1:06:38
Well, it’s all congenial,
1:06:46
and wherever you
1:06:50
can put your finger at some point on that continuum, and
1:06:56
your guess is as good as anyone else’s guess,
1:07:00
in my view.
1:07:00
And you know what the continuum is.
1:07:08
I don’t see much of a distinction.
1:07:13
On the extreme, obviously, is that the strictly-applied research, you already
1:07:18
know where you want to go, in my view, as you are looking for a practical answer to
1:07:26
a problem.
1:07:28
There is a management problem, or
1:07:31
engineering problem, or something.
1:07:39
In basic research, you are also trying to solve a problem, but
1:07:43
it may not be related to any
1:07:47
application.
1:07:49
You may just want to know why bees are attracted to a certain flower.
1:08:02
It could be applied, because you could use that in some way to
1:08:05
maybe increase honey production
1:08:13
or something like that.
1:08:14
[Laughs]
1:08:15
That is a good response.
1:08:17
I’ve had a lot of different responses to that question.
1:08:20
Some of the people can make a distinction, the importance of
1:08:24
applied-versus-basic research, and how that applies at the Andrews.
1:08:28
In your perception, what is going on at the Andrews, would you say
1:08:30
is applied research or basic?
1:08:30
It could be
1:08:37
the same
1:08:40
research problem, but it could have basic components.
1:08:48
That is, no real applicability
1:08:53
in terms of anything that we know of at the present time, or it could be very
1:08:58
practical from a management point-of-view.
1:09:03
Same activity, same set of questions.
1:09:13
I don’t know the breadth of everything going on in the Andrews.
1:09:17
I think there is certainly a lot of this applied research by design.
1:09:23
This is the whole idea we began with.
1:09:23
But there is a lot of your basic stuff going on as well.
1:09:24
Do
1:09:41
you have any examples?
1:09:45
Well, for example, the work we are doing with stream sediments.
1:09:53
We are interested in making a link between
1:10:00
management practices and stream productivity.
1:10:07
That is a very applied type of thing, and applied type of question.
1:10:15
And often, quite frankly, we have to couch things in those terms in
1:10:26
order to get the funding, pure and simple.
1:10:26
But having said that, then,
1:10:29
the bottom line is, we found some differences,
1:10:35
but we also found some very interesting relationships that were
1:10:40
totally unexpected and that are going
1:10:46
to be directives for future research.
1:10:51
One of those that we found, is that there is increased, very much
1:10:55
higher nitrogen fixation in the sediments in old-growth stretches
1:11:00
than in non-old-growth stretches.
1:11:07
This could have implications, but it goes back to more basic questions about what
1:11:14
is really going on in those streams, and how they function in a very basic way.
1:11:22
Another example we have found in that study, that evidently,
1:11:27
there are shifts in the sources of carbon coming into that stream.
1:11:32
Not too surprisingly.
1:11:34
But there have been other studies, and they had not seen this
1:11:40
kind of thing.
1:11:40
We were able to
1:11:49
document
1:11:52
flushes of, and shifts in the characteristics of the chemical,
1:11:56
microbiological characteristics of these sediments, the organic fraction of
1:12:07
these sediments, which was only kind of inferred before,
1:12:09
and we actually showed it.
1:12:12
We showed that these pulses were very, very short lived,
1:12:17
maybe within a matter of days.
1:12:21
These had some very important implications into how, basically,
1:12:26
streams work in terms of sources of carbon and their resins in the streams.
1:12:33
Likewise, we saw a pulse of increased activity in the spring, as the algae
1:12:41
in the stream started cranking up, and this was not epizootic fungi,
1:12:47
but was a longer-term import.
1:12:52
So, these things had been kind of suspected, but she showed this
1:12:56
very, very nicely in her study.
1:12:58
And we also saw that there were long-term differences in what was
1:13:05
going on in these various trees, and we found elevational differences, which
1:13:09
were also very interesting because this suggests that climate-driven
1:13:17
mechanisms that were affecting the quality of carbon in the stream.
1:13:21
These were all very much basic questions that were either addressed,
1:13:27
or things that were questions of a very basic nature that were generated.
1:13:35
We started out trying to answer practical questions, primarily because that is how
1:13:39
we get funding from the Forest Service.
1:13:41
They were only interested because we were talking about very applied things.
1:13:48
But, what all of these have when you generate some relation, when you are
1:13:55
just out there measuring something to answer one specific question, and then
1:14:01
you go and look at something else.
1:14:03
But, if you try to generalize it enough so that there are enough cases to generalize,
1:14:09
you always pick up very important basic
1:14:16
information.
1:14:20
At least, that’s been my experience.
1:14:21
Here is another example, a study that we did.
1:14:24
Just a regional study.
1:14:26
The basic question from the BLM was this: If we thin full-stands, are the
1:14:32
soil processes going to be more like old growth or more like fire stands?
1:14:38
Very much another management question.
1:14:44
What we found was, that a lot of the variables we looked at did
1:14:47
in fact move towards old growth that we were able to measure.
1:14:51
There was a range, there was a difference.
1:14:56
When you thinned them, and they were allowed to regenerate for enough time,
1:15:01
you could get more vegetation coming in.
1:15:04
More variables similar to the structure you get with old growth is the whole idea,
1:15:12
that these variables start moving towards old-growth characteristics.
1:15:17
So, on that level, you have answered a question.
1:15:21
On a much more basic level, we ask another question, that is, “Do these
1:15:27
behave differently, biogeochemically?
1:15:33
Are
1:15:35
the mechanisms driving the biogeochemistry the same in old-growth stands as they
1:15:40
are in full stands, and how does the thin, full-stand look in that?” So, we
1:15:47
did a principle components analysis of this grove, and we found that the full
1:15:55
stand and the thinned full stand behaved exactly the way we thought it would.
1:16:00
In other words, the variables that we clustered out together,
1:16:02
did cluster out together.
1:16:05
Old growth was behaving much more different, much
1:16:13
different.
1:16:13
This wasn’t just a few cases.
1:16:15
These were sites from southern Oregon to the Cascades to the Coast Range.
1:16:24
You lumped all of those numbers in there, you come up with the same answer
1:16:27
now about what the hell’s going on.
1:16:29
That is very interesting on a very basic level.
1:16:35
Again, we were able to answer the practical question, “No, they are not
1:16:39
the same! They are not functioning the same.” So, we also found out some very
1:16:44
interesting basic things and answered some very basic questions in terms of
1:16:50
how do the geochemical processes work.
1:16:54
What is influencing what under there?
1:16:57
And there are a different set of rules driving the old-growth forest!
1:17:04
So, you really raised some new questions?
1:17:06
Oh yes, absolutely.
1:17:08
But you also come up with very interesting, basic information about
1:17:15
forests that we didn’t know before.
1:17:19
And that is really not of much interest in application to the forest
1:17:23
manager, other than, well you didn’t quite get it that way you think here.
1:17:30
So, we have to ask some very important questions in terms
1:17:33
of how old-growth forests do
1:17:37
function.
1:17:37
Why are they functioning?
1:17:38
Apparently, they function differently than these managed stands.
1:17:45
So, you design studies that are answering applied questions partly
1:17:55
to secure funding, but you design your studies in ways that allow
1:17:58
you to pursue basic science while you are answering their questions?
1:18:03
Yeah, and it works the other way around as well.
1:18:06
Well, let’s see, what would be a good
1:18:13
example?
1:18:21
There have been a number of studies that I have conducted that are strictly
1:18:25
just to find out what influences soil respiration at different scales, with
1:18:32
no real bent on management, per se.
1:18:38
Just to understand that.
1:18:40
We have
1:18:44
come up with things that are potentially important from
1:18:46
those studies for management.
1:18:48
So, we can go either way.
1:18:53
I guess it just depends on what kind of question you start out with.
1:18:59
[Laughs]
1:18:59
Now this is
1:19:03
a question that I’ve been trying to get people to address in some way.
1:19:08
That is, as a scientist,
1:19:14
you know how the system works pretty well and you can formulate these
1:19:17
questions in a way that someone without your experience couldn’t do.
1:19:21
Who do you consider your most important audience or audiences,
1:19:26
and who are you working for?
1:19:30
What group of people are you trying to inform of the values of
1:19:39
science?
1:19:49
Value of the science?
1:19:51
Who should you be writing for?
1:19:53
You need to be writing to different audiences.
1:19:54
If you are just pitching it to one audience, you are
1:19:59
probably missing the boat.
1:20:01
I think it is important to pitch it to students so they
1:20:05
can use it as a learning tool.
1:20:08
You need to pitch it towards managers and people that are
1:20:13
actually doing work out there.
1:20:15
Pitch it in a way that they can understand the implications of your work.
1:20:19
And you need to pitch it to your colleagues on a level
1:20:24
that multi-disciplinary
1:20:29
folks can understand it.
1:20:31
I haven’t published on that scale, but I think that it is important to do so.
1:20:36
That would be BioScience, that would be some of the more general, Scientific
1:20:41
American, that kind of thing, where you are putting out concepts to a larger,
1:20:53
professionally-informed audience and to the specialist, because they’re
1:21:00
very much interested in, specifically, the type of work you are doing.
1:21:06
I must say that,
1:21:13
professionally, I run a much wider gamut than most people
1:21:19
even
1:21:22
dream of.
1:21:22
I’ve published in microbiology, working with
1:21:30
plasmas, an incredible range of things.
1:21:33
To me, that’s good, because I have been able to reach lots of different audiences.
1:21:45
But, I think that it is a mistake in general for science
1:21:50
to only target, their peers.
1:21:57
A few hundred people in the universe that give a shit what they are doing.
1:22:03
[Laughs] Don’t need to quote me on that.
1:22:08
Well, you’d be surprised how many people
1:22:17
say that.
1:22:19
As you pointed out, you have unique
1:22:25
experiences in various areas and also demonstrated willingness to jump
1:22:26
disciplinary boundaries, though you don’t have any formal training in
1:22:26
writing to publish in those areas.
1:22:36
Have you ever had any problem with that in terms of other professionals,
1:22:41
or have you found people being pretty congenial in receiving your interests?
1:22:46
Oh yeah, no problem.
1:22:53
As a matter-of-fact, this is kind of just a fluke of this context.
1:23:01
Within about two or three years of first getting into studying mycorrhizal
1:23:07
mats, I knew nothing about fungi
1:23:13
at all, but within about three or four years, I was giving a keynote
1:23:16
address to an international conference on mycorrhizal fungi in England.
1:23:21
That
1:23:26
must of been
1:23:29
kind of intimidating!
1:23:29
It was, absolutely.
1:23:30
[Laughs] It just so happened that I met one of the top people in the
1:23:34
field here, we hit it off great, and I learned a lot from him.
1:23:41
He was interested in what I was doing, and he had so much interest in what I was
1:23:46
doing that he put me at the top of the bill of this symposium he was leading!
1:23:51
How did it come off?
1:23:53
Fine!
1:23:53
I was scared shitless, but it was fine!
1:23:54
[Laughs]
1:23:54
I am curious, though, your perceptions of why more people don’t do that,
1:23:54
cross disciplinary boundaries like that, form more roots like that.
1:23:54
Oh, it’s scary.
1:23:54
[Laughs] And, I don’t know.
1:23:54
People are not hostile or anything?
1:23:54
Oh no!
1:23:54
My perception is that usually people are happy to have some interdisciplinary
1:23:54
work, but nobody wants to do it.
1:23:54
It’s kind of an interesting paradox.
1:23:54
Well, very frankly, it’s curricular.
1:23:54
And quite frankly, part of it is because of economic necessity.
1:23:55
I’ve been on soft funds for 24 years.
1:23:55
That’s
1:23:58
scary, so you have to be very flexible.
1:25:05
A lot of that was driven in that way.
1:25:07
But, the system is not set up to promote you,
1:25:15
if you do it.
1:25:17
Typically, as you get up into the professorial ranks, they are looking
1:25:23
for international leaders in the field.
1:25:25
But if you jump around from field-to-field, you will never quite get
1:25:31
there.
1:25:31
That’s not so true starting out, but you’ve got a combination of where you’ve
1:25:39
got to put your energies, if you’ve got funding from different sources.
1:25:42
At one point, I had funding looking at organisms from the deep sub-surface,
1:25:48
and a project with DOE where we were looking at microorganisms in groundwater
1:25:52
in basalts 2000 feet below the surface, looking at how they were functioning,
1:26:00
real basic, physiological studies.
1:26:04
And there were even studies of the Andrews setting up streams.
1:26:20
Did you keep working on soft money all that time because it gives you
1:26:25
more freedom to do your work, or just difficulty in the marketplace?
1:26:33
Well, I just wanted to stay here.
1:26:34
Just locally?
1:26:36
Oh yeah.
1:26:39
Ever since we
1:26:48
got here.
1:26:48
It was a matter of personal choice.
1:26:53
It’s been great, because you are kind of like a mercenary scientist.
1:27:00
As long as they give you a place to work, and what not.
1:27:04
Logan [Norris] has been fantastic, he is a great department head [Forest
1:27:10
Science, OSU College of Forestry] , and he has given me a home and
1:27:14
we’ve got cash flow, we’ve got students coming and going, we got all these labs
1:27:19
set up, and lots of things happening.
1:27:22
So, it
1:27:24
worked out alright without too much anxiety for you?
1:27:27
It takes a lot of hustle to bring in the kind of bucks to keep the lab
1:27:27
going, about a quarter million a year.
1:27:27
So, you spend a lot of time just funding everything?
1:27:27
Oh
1:27:39
yeah.
1:27:43
70 percent of my time, easy.
1:27:49
70 percent?
1:27:50
70, seven-zero.
1:27:52
That is one of the reasons
1:28:08
I got the hell out, retired.
1:28:11
Now I, you know, piece of cake!
1:28:15
[Laughter]
1:28:16
One last question.
1:28:19
I was wondering if you could thumb through your assessment of how you might
1:28:25
characterize the efforts of the Andrews group, as a group, to convey information.
1:28:33
What are the various, more successful ways they try to accomplish that, and
1:28:39
how would you gauge their success?
1:28:40
I don’t think that I want to answer this
1:28:44
one.
1:28:44
Well,
1:28:47
I think, overall, the group does very well.
1:28:50
If you look at all the workshops and all the things that we do at the Andrews,
1:29:00
the group has done an excellent job in terms of conveying to a whole broad
1:29:07
spectrum of people what is going on, what they are doing, what the implications are.
1:29:16
And that is, again, tours, workshops, symposiums, you
1:29:26
name it.
1:29:26
I think that,
1:29:29
and most people who have been active have been very, very good about publishing
1:29:35
in the professional literature.
1:29:40
In terms of synthesis, that is where you always have problems.
1:29:46
You’ve heard before about the famous book [the never completed Andrews synthesis
1:29:50
volume] that been worked on for 20 years?
1:29:54
It’s just so hard to pull that off, because everyone has got so
1:30:00
much on their plate, and these things are just so time-consuming.
1:30:06
So, I guess, but that’s nothing new.
1:30:08
I mean, it has been documented in almost every review we have
1:30:13
had, and it’s not unique here,
1:30:17
and it would be nice to do more of
1:30:27
a formal synthesis.
1:30:28
Who would a formal paper be targeted at as opposed to special
1:30:32
publications and journals and such?
1:30:34
Well, it would be a more general audience, it would be in the form of a book.
1:30:43
And what we talked about most recently, is to
1:30:49
use the main theme of the LTER for or as kind of the nucleus for this book,
1:30:56
a series of chapters or whatever.
1:30:58
But it would be fairly-targeted, mostly targeted to forestry professionals,
1:31:05
I would think, so the forest sciences [audience] . In terms of kind of a
1:31:10
general ecology type of thing or in terms of kind of a general science,
1:31:17
general interest type of thing.
1:31:19
No,
1:31:33
it would
1:31:37
be more specific than that.
1:31:37
Okay, I should let you get back to work.
