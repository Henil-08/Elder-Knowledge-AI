00:27
I understand you joined the faculty here and the group [Andrews EF] in 1985.
00:32
Maybe you could talk a little about your personal background up until that
00:35
point and how you came to be here.
00:38
How I came to be here.
00:39
Well, I was thinking about that the other day, and the first time I actually
00:44
met people who were from the Andrews, I remember meeting Jim Sedell and Kermit
00:51
Cromack, I’m not sure who else, but it was at the ESA meeting in Athens, Georgia.
00:59
That was back in
01:03
1976, or maybe ’77.
01:09
They were really hot on coarse woody debris and streams,
01:13
and working in Mack Creek.
01:15
Now that I’ve been to all these places, I can sort of reconstruct
01:18
what they must have told me.
01:20
[Chuckle]
01:20
Yeah.
01:21
But, that was my first inkling of it.
01:31
I think the first time I met Jerry Franklin
01:38
was down in Florida.
01:39
I went down to Florida for a MAB [UNESCO Man and the Biosphere
01:41
Program] conference with the Soviets.
01:44
At that time I was just down there to get exposed to it, and see Florida.
01:50
So, I met Jerry and Art McKee, not really
02:01
in a formal way or in an interview or anything, but just
02:05
getting to know these guys.
02:08
I remember in another conference seeing Art and a whole bunch of
02:12
fellas, probably Jim Sedell, and Jerry, who talked about the Hoh
02:18
“pulse” [Hoh River, Olympic National Park] , which was done just before.
02:21
I was starting to think about going to OSU, so, I kind of
02:27
had an awareness of the group.
02:28
Even then, they were known for real integrated studies.
02:33
We would hear crazy things.
02:34
This was when I was in Tennessee at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.
02:39
We would hear things about people climbing trees with ropes, and all kinds of strange
02:44
things going on out in the Northwest.
02:48
So, it sounded like a really interesting place.
02:51
Then I was a guide for Jerry during the fall.
02:56
I was working in the Great Smokies [National Park] . So I guided him;
03:02
he came right at the height of flower season, a perfect time for Jerry.
03:07
We talked about graduate school, and that was the first time I
03:10
really got the idea that there might be some opportunity to come up.
03:15
The whole idea of integrated work and also working in a team appealed to me.
03:21
Uh-huh.
03:22
I read a lot of IBP reports and that was emphasized, but as I was
03:28
working, it was very hard to find.
03:30
You know, a lot of people talked it, but they didn’t walk it, sort of stuff, and
03:35
this looked like a place where they really did that, so this was very exciting.
03:40
At that point, Jerry came up with a project which had spun out of this Hoh
03:45
“pulse,” what they did up on the Olympics -- [Pulse – A gathering of science people
03:48
in the field for a week-plus of intensive field work and bonding experiences.]
03:48
Uh-huh.
03:49
-- dealing with nurse logs.
03:50
At that point, I decided that that would be fun, and he [Jerry
03:55
Franklin] had funding for me to attend graduate school and get a Ph.D.
03:59
Okay.
04:00
So, I came out, and that was in December of 1980.
04:06
I would say over about a three-year period I learned about them, and then
04:10
sort of suddenly within the year, like ‘79-’80, I really got a good idea of the
04:16
project that Jerry had been working on.
04:18
I’d like to go back a little bit when you did undergraduate work at Amherst.
04:23
Amherst College.
04:25
I was a biology major.
04:27
They actually had a natural history major at that time that
04:30
they were trying to get rid of.
04:32
Okay.
04:32
I was always interested in ecology, natural history, that kind of thing.
04:37
They phased it out, so, for a while there I didn’t have a major.
04:40
They actually stuck me in chemistry.
04:43
Oh.
04:43
I
04:45
had to struggle to get into biology.
04:48
And they had some very good people there at the time, but ecology,
04:53
there was this debate in the faculty about if ecology was a science.
04:59
If you weren’t pre-med, were you really going to be up to snuff?
05:03
There were I think out of thirty students, there were three biology
05:06
majors who were not pre-med.
05:08
Uh-Huh.
05:09
The rest were all going to med school.
05:11
So, it was a great education, but they were not really into ecology, and
05:19
pretty much turned out pre-med students.
05:22
What attracted you to go to Amherst?
05:24
Were you from that area?
05:25
I’m from Massachusetts originally, about 20 miles west of Boston.
05:31
I
05:35
got actual opportunities to go to lots of different places.
05:38
I was a football player and a pretty good student, so lots of
05:45
colleges were interested in me.
05:48
Sort of that or Harvard was the choice, and Harvard was just too
05:52
big, too remote, even though it was near the city that I lived near.
05:59
But, it just seemed too big and too remote for the professors.
06:04
Amherst was small and rural, and you didn’t have graduate students
06:09
teaching, you had professors teaching.
06:11
Hmm.
06:12
So that was real appealing.
06:13
And plus, it had a great reputation.
06:15
What attracted you from Amherst then to Tennessee?
06:19
Well, I worked in Glacier National Park for a fella named Steve Casell.
06:26
He was an Amherst graduate, working at Cornell.
06:31
And Steve had this project on vegetation and fires and
06:35
management of national parks, and I was really interested in that.
06:40
I was thinking, originally, I would go into that sort of more management aspect.
06:44
In an internship?
06:45
Well sort of.
06:46
It was actually a volunteer program.
06:49
Okay.
06:49
Forty bucks a week, and they supplied the food.
06:52
So, it was okay.
06:54
We camped out, so there weren’t the expenses.
06:58
I worked on this crew there during the summer in the west part of Glacier,
07:03
and then stayed on until, let’s see, I think December, doing other things.
07:12
That was great in terms of staying there, but it wasn’t
07:14
as exciting as the field work.
07:18
From that I went home and couldn’t really find any jobs that I wanted.
07:23
I had a sense I wanted to work outside, work in forestry,
07:27
or something like management.
07:29
Not real forestry in the sense of cutting down trees, but management of
07:34
a forest area, like a national park.
07:38
So, I ended up working at a gas station.
07:40
I ended up working at a paper factory, and then someone called me.
07:47
Actually, it was a guy I’d met at Glacier, a fellow I worked with on my crew.
07:51
And he said, “Hey, you know, there’s a job down here in the Great Smokies.”
07:56
His name was Mark Huff, by the way.
07:58
He works in the PNW Station now.
08:02
He called me up and said, “I’m doing a project myself here in the Smokies, and
08:07
there’s this guy who’s doing this fish project, and I know you like to fish and
08:12
all that.” And he said, “Well, it’s only like forty bucks a week.” So, I thought
08:17
about it for about two seconds and said, “Fine, I’m getting on a bus and going.”
08:21
[Chuckle].
08:21
I had an alternative to be moved up to inspecting tea bag labels for $250 a week.
08:26
I thought I’ll
08:29
just do tromping around in streams for forty.
08:32
I’m going down to tromp in streams.
08:35
So, I got on a bus and just rode down there.
08:37
Endless ride to Knoxville, Tennessee.
08:42
When I got to the park there, I did that project for the summer
08:47
and I kind of linked projects.
08:49
I worked on a wild boar project for a while.
08:52
I was just sort of figuring, what did I really want to do?
08:55
What did I want to study outside?
08:57
It turned out it was plants and ecosystem-related stuff.
09:03
What I’d worked on at in the Smokies and Glacier dealt with fire and fuels.
09:09
I realized that there was a whole, this area of ecosystem analysis where
09:14
you could actually do more than just measure what’s there, but kind of
09:18
predict what’s there and why it’s there, and it wasn’t being applied.
09:23
I thought, that would be fun to do.
09:26
That’s what kind of got me into ecosystems.
09:30
So, I had a project in the Smokies.
09:34
Actually, there were some wildfires and I went out there and looked at them
09:37
and decided I’ll do my masters on that.
09:42
I completed that work in about three years, I guess.
09:48
Were there any particular faculty members or other people that you worked
09:52
with at Amherst and Tennessee, who kind of steered you along the way?
09:55
Yeah, actually it was kind of funny, because I got probably better guidance on
09:59
that from the people in the Park Service.
10:06
Oh yeah?
10:06
At Amherst, the two ecologists that were a lot of help were Lincoln Brauer, who
10:13
I think ended up at Florida, eventually.
10:17
The other was Stuart Fisher, who’d come from
10:22
Hubbard Brook.
10:24
He was an aquatic biologist, a more ecosystem type, and he had a big
10:29
influence on the way I thought.
10:33
He moved on, I think, to Arizona.
10:36
I know he was in the Southwest.
10:39
He had a lot of really good students come out.
10:43
So anyways,
10:46
that was fun.
10:50
Then, at Tennessee I actually came in with a whole designed project I funded myself.
10:56
I had my own project and worked that out with Susan Brattan, who
11:01
was the leader of a thing called the Uplands Field Laboratory,
11:06
which was in the Great Smokies.
11:08
This was sort of during a revival of Park Service financing.
11:12
They were great.
11:13
They set up a laboratory at Sequoia [NP] , and in Florida at
11:19
Everglades [NP] , and Great Smokies [NP] , and maybe some other places.
11:23
But it was sort of a building of their science program.
11:26
Susan was at Tennessee, or with the Park Service?
11:29
She was at the Park Service.
11:30
She came out of Cornell and worked on the wild boar and its effect
11:35
on plants, particularly understory plants, wild flowers and smokies,
11:42
which is a big attraction of that park.
11:46
The boars were just decimating them, so she got into this area of research
11:51
on the boar, and their effects.
11:54
Plus, she just started a whole expansion of studies on the vegetation, fire,
12:01
and aquatic studies; all kinds of things started to happen about then.
12:07
Another big influence was Peter White, who was a Park Service
12:12
employee and he became the
12:18
director of the North Carolina Botanical Gardens.
12:27
He was at Tennessee when you were there?
12:29
Well, he was actually Park Service.
12:32
What I did was I went in and found someone who was generally
12:35
interested in the subject.
12:36
That was Ed Klauch, who has since retired.
12:39
He was in botany there.
12:42
Ed was very interested and supportive, and he spent a lot of his time talking to me
12:51
because every week I’d go in and pester him about some question, not necessarily
12:56
on my studies, just about ecology.
12:58
Uh-huh.
12:58
What did he think about this or that, or how could someone think this?
13:03
They must be idiots.
13:04
You know, typical, arrogant, young person talk.
13:08
But, I learned a lot by that.
13:11
Another big influence was Jerry Olsen, who was at the Oakridge National Laboratory.
13:17
I read a lot of Jerry’s stuff on carbon cycling and decomposition.
13:22
I went out and talked with him a couple times about how you make a litter bag,
13:28
which seems kind of silly now, but I talked with him a lot about that.
13:33
I had courses with him, special courses I set up, reading-and-discussion.
13:39
I absorbed a lot from Jerry.
13:41
He’s a very interesting guy.
13:43
He’s sort of other-worldly.
13:46
I mean, he’s the epitome of the absent-minded professor.
13:50
Hmm.
13:51
I remember once, I hope this isn’t too much of a digression, but
13:54
just to show you; he [Olsen] had a regular class, and we had our
13:58
reading-and-conference before that.
14:02
The class started, say, at one o’clock.
14:05
We go to a restaurant to eat lunch, it’s five minutes before one, and he says
14:09
to the waitress, “we’re in a hurry, can you hurry?” So, half past one, after
14:13
we’ve stuffed everything down and eaten way too fast, he appears for his class
14:21
half-hour late, totally unfazed, and just starts talking to his students.
14:27
He was amazing that way, but he has
14:31
lots of good insights into ecosystems, carbon-cycling, that stuff.
14:36
You kept contact with him over the years?
14:39
Not too much, but in terms of an influence, he’s always
14:42
been an influence on me.
14:45
How to think about a problem; I think that was the key.
14:48
He gave me a real insight on how to think about the kinds of
14:51
problems that I’m dealing with now.
14:54
And he actually set me on the track 20 years ago to do the kind
14:58
of research I’m doing now, got me interested in the whole idea.
15:03
Your research priorities while you were at Tennessee, what kind
15:06
of things you were focusing on?
15:08
I assume you were going to conferences to present your work.
15:11
Some.
15:11
We had at that time, still do, I think, a conference for
15:15
Smokies research in the spring.
15:17
When I went to
15:20
Athens, Georgia, I presented some of my work there.
15:24
Gave a poster session, not a single person showed up.
15:28
It was really embarrassing.
15:32
Next to me was Jerry Malaloff, who is a very famous person
15:36
in decomposition kind of work.
15:38
People were streaming by, and they were mostly saying hello to Jerry.
15:42
It was pretty humbling.
15:44
But that’s where I met Kermit Cromack, Jim Sedell, and that group.
15:49
So I did that.
15:50
They also had Park Service
15:55
conferences back then.
15:58
They had two of them, I think.
16:01
They had one in New Orleans, and I presented at that, and
16:05
there was one in San Francisco.
16:07
They were a couple, three years apart.
16:12
Those were real good experiences.
16:14
Had you been out to the Northwest before you ran into Jerry at the conference?
16:17
Yeah, actually I had.
16:18
When I was in undergraduate school, my brother lived in Nevada and we
16:22
hitchhiked out with my girlfriend and to help him build his house.
16:26
So, we went through the Northwest, across Washington, and down through Seattle.
16:36
We didn’t really enjoy Oregon that much because it was so
16:39
hard hitchhiking through it.
16:41
[Chuckle]
16:42
So, I hadn’t had this great opinion of the state.
16:45
You mean no one would pick you up?
16:46
Yeah, it was hard to get rides.
16:48
Actually, we went down 101, and we didn’t have time to get out
16:52
and see anything, we just saw 101.
16:55
Lincoln City, for example was just like, “Oh my God, what are we doing
16:59
here?” It’s still like that today, but I kinda can see the other stuff.
17:04
But at that time, it was all Lincoln City, which seemed endless.
17:08
Like it took about ten rides to get through Lincoln City.
17:15
But I spent time in Nevada, and seeing the West.
17:18
I’d also spent some time in seeing Montana.
17:22
I went to a geology summer camp in Montana, which was a big influence.
17:27
I found out I was not going to be a geologist because I just
17:31
absolutely sucked as a geologist.
17:33
But, I found myself always looking at the trees.
17:36
Trying to figure out what a Douglas-fir looked like, which I didn’t have a
17:39
clue, but I knew that somewhere out West there were these Douglas-fir trees.
17:46
Uh-huh.
17:47
So that was kind of a shaping event in that I realized geology wasn’t my forte,
17:53
but maybe understanding vegetation would be because I was very interested in it.
18:00
So then, you made the decision to come out here, when I guess Jerry offered
18:04
a graduate assistantship to you?
18:07
Was that it?
18:08
Yeah, it was through the Park Service.
18:11
Let’s see.
18:12
What was his work for?
18:14
Well, those were back in the days when Jerry could go to agencies and
18:17
say, “I would like to have this kind of money, and I’ll do this project.”
18:23
And they would say, “That sounds good, we’ll fund it.” Particularly in the
18:27
Park Service, which didn’t have a real rigorous review system of proposals.
18:33
He had a student, Miles Hemstrom, who was working on a vegetation model.
18:42
And out of that project he had enough money to bootleg some studies of the
18:50
nurse log phenomena, which they really were impressed with up at the Hoh
18:56
rainforest [Olympic National Park] . In fact, they were puzzled the whole time.
19:01
Why were all the seedlings on logs?
19:04
You could go out in these big open areas, and there just wouldn’t be seedlings
19:08
on the forest floor or on the ground.
19:11
So, it became a real puzzle, and so that was what the project was about.
19:20
You mentioned you had some inkling of what was going on at the Andrews
19:23
before Jerry made the offer.
19:25
How would you characterize your understanding of the mission
19:29
of the research group or the Andrews itself, at that point?
19:31
Well,
19:34
I knew they had an important role in the Coniferous Forest Biome.
19:38
I knew they were studying old-growth forests, and finding out things about them
19:44
and taking some real fresh perspectives, like, if you want to find out what’s going
19:50
on in a tree, why don’t you go climb it and see what’s going on up in a tree.
19:55
And the stuff on woody detritus was all very new.
20:01
Also, they were doing some of these very classic studies at the time; well,
20:06
they turned out to be classic studies, on nutrient-cycling with Phil Sollins.
20:12
Phil had been at University of Tennessee, so I had read
20:16
his thesis on carbon-cycling.
20:27
Chuck Grier was talking about production ecology and biomass of forests,
20:33
so I was kind of aware of that.
20:36
I’d read a lot at Oak Ridge which had the Eastern Deciduous Biome [IBP site
20:40
in Eastern Deciduous Biome category] . I think it was one of the places.
20:44
I’d just read tons of stuff from Oak Ridge about what they were doing.
20:48
And part of that was because of Jerry Olsen, but just because I knew there
20:54
were some really good people there, so I wanted to find out what they were doing.
20:58
Hmm.
20:59
So, I had a good sense they were doing very solid ecosystem
21:02
work in the old-growth forests.
21:04
The connection to management didn’t strike me at the time.
21:10
Some other things I just didn’t know.
21:13
Not at all.
21:14
The basic history before that, oblivious.
21:19
You came in when the LTER was in a transition period?
21:25
Yeah.
21:27
How well were you aware of the development of that program at that point?
21:29
Well, I knew Jerry was involved, and one of the things I remember asking him
21:35
was that maybe he and Dick Waring should run a course on how you run this thing.
21:42
And Jerry kinda looked at me like [chuckles], “Well, I don’t know how I run
21:47
it either so I can’t tell anyone.” But, I was impressed as a student that anyone
21:53
could manage something so ambitious.
21:57
Jerry
22:04
took us up there on some tours at the Andrews and that were really fun.
22:07
I met Art McKee.
22:08
I know I’d seen him before at these meetings, but I met him on one
22:14
of the tours in the winter, and he was the first person to really
22:19
welcome my wife and I to Oregon.
22:21
It was a very strange scene when we first arrived.
22:25
Because mostly, I interacted with Jerry’s students, and they were,
22:29
I couldn’t put my finger on it.
22:31
At Tennessee we had a very small group, but friendly.
22:35
We kind of were all outsiders in town.
22:39
Here, it seemed people were more like us, but they weren’t as friendly.
22:45
They probably had other interests and stuff.
22:47
So, I’ll never forget that Art was so supportive and
22:51
interested in us being here.
22:54
We were kind of, after that field trip, like, gee, we’re amazed.
23:04
Other than that, I really wasn’t too involved in the LTER.
23:10
There were these pulses that Jerry had.
23:13
There was one in Sequoia, and that was part of the LTER, but I gather there
23:20
were some disagreements about that.
23:22
So,
23:24
we went on that, but it was sort of a part-LTER thing.
23:29
And it was sort of extending the findings to other regions I guess was the idea.
23:41
Then there was the work at Mount St. Helens.
23:43
So, I guess what I’m saying is, I interacted with LTER scientists quite
23:47
a bit, but not really in an LTER sense.
23:49
Yeah, okay.
23:50
I mean, I knew they were there.
23:52
I knew who they were.
23:53
Sometimes we’d go on field trips together, but generally
23:56
I was not part of that program.
23:58
The people you worked most closely at that time, were primarily
24:00
Jerry and other graduate students?
24:03
Jerry, other graduate students, and the Park Service, because I was working
24:07
up at the Hoh, and I worked a lot with people, mainly arranging logistics.
24:16
Uh-huh.
24:18
One job I took on, for example, was measuring the elk exclosures they
24:22
put up on the south fork of the Hoh.
24:27
One thing they were impressed with in the pulse, was the lack
24:31
of vegetation on the forest floor.
24:34
Elk were known to eat it, deer too.
24:36
They put up a big exclosure, and I ended up with the data.
24:40
It’s sitting in here, unpublished.
24:44
I’ve taken that on since
24:49
1980.
24:53
I worked at Cascade Head as well, which had a similar situation
24:56
to the Hoh, vegetation-wise.
24:59
So, I worked a lot with Jack Booth.
25:04
He showed me where things were, helped me make gizmos, and set up
25:09
experiments, that kind of stuff.
25:15
You already mentioned how the social environment was when you came to OSU.
25:20
What were your perceptions at that time or how could you characterize
25:22
OSU in relation to other universities you’d been at up until then, in terms
25:27
of faculty interaction among the
25:33
different disciplines and such?
25:33
It’s kind of hard to say.
25:36
I feel that my situation was a bit unusual.
25:39
For example, I was in Botany and Plant Pathology, and that was my major, but
25:44
my office was over here [OSU College of Forestry] because I worked with Jerry.
25:47
Jerry was an adjunct professor there,
25:53
but, actually, Jerry worked a lot more with the forest science people.
25:56
So, in a very odd way, the Forest Science Department kind of adopted me.
26:02
I mean, I would go over to botany for official stuff, and
26:05
I had a mailbox over there.
26:09
I took courses in the department, but this was really kind of my home.
26:14
If I had to order something, I wouldn’t go over to botany, I’d go to John Gordon,
26:20
the department head of Forest Science.
26:24
When I gave my thesis presentation defense, Logan Norris showed up [Logan
26:29
was Head of Forest Science and a supporter of the Andrews Forest] . But my
26:30
department chair over in botany probably wasn’t even aware I was defending,
26:35
so I had a very weird relationship.
26:40
I tied in more closely with the Forest Science faculty than the botany faculty.
26:45
Okay.
26:46
I had Dick Waring on my committee, and he was in Forest Science, and Kermit Cromack.
26:52
Jerry was in Botany, but actually, he was mostly working with Forest Science.
26:56
The only people in botany I had
27:03
were Mark Wilson and Everett Hansen.
27:07
They were real helpful, but somehow, I
27:12
was a forest science student trapped in the Botany Department.
27:19
It’s hard for me to comment on that, because it was an odd
27:23
situation right from the get-go.
27:25
It sounds like what you’re saying is that there wasn’t a lot of connection
27:29
that you felt with the botany program, other graduate students in that program.
27:31
No, not really.
27:34
What was happening then, was I probably should have enrolled in Forest Science.
27:39
But the dean and the department had very rigorous demands on what
27:47
you knew in forestry as background.
27:49
Basically, you had to have an undergraduate degree in forest management.
27:52
It
27:55
was a matter of did I want to take a year’s worth of undergraduate courses, or
28:02
just enroll in botany and get on with things.
28:06
So, that’s what I did.
28:10
Until recently, our department had those restrictions, and we got rid of them about
28:14
three years ago and it’s really helped.
28:17
We now take really strong environmental science background students of any type,
28:25
and they don’t have to be forest managers to get in, which is the way it used to be.
28:33
About the time you came here, I think it was when the Forest Science
28:36
faculty moved into this building.
28:38
Were you able to?
28:39
Yeah.
28:40
I was here, and they were down at the FRL [Forest Research Lab-OSU] , so
28:48
they were split at that time, if I remember right.
28:51
Some were here, a lot were down at the FRL.
28:54
In the
28:58
early ‘80s, thanks to Forest Service downsizing, a
29:05
lot of office space opened up, so, a lot of people came up here.
29:10
That helped tremendously, but again, the people I saw a lot,
29:14
were forest science professors.
29:18
They were doing the kind of work I was interested in, like Dick
29:22
Waring’s work and Phil Sollins’ work.
29:26
That was what I was interested in, more than straight community-analysis.
29:32
That’s what botany was good at.
29:36
You say that the move over here helped tremendously?
29:40
When the Forest Science faculty came up here it was much better.
29:44
Then there was more interaction with the faculty.
29:47
Oh, okay.
29:48
You mean between graduate students?
29:49
Yeah, that was great, and also better integration with the Forest Service.
29:56
Okay.
29:56
I mean, physically, the way they did it.
29:59
We didn’t get floors.
30:00
We got offices.
30:02
Mixed in?
30:03
Always mixed in.
30:05
I was going to ask.
30:06
You worked a lot with the National Park Service, and it sounds like the
30:10
faculty in Tennessee [University] were pretty close with the Park Service.
30:16
I was wondering if you could characterize the interaction among
30:20
Forest Service and OSU scientists in comparison with that [interactions]
30:26
in Tennessee with the Park Service.
30:28
I think it’s much, much tighter between the Forest Service and the
30:33
academic scientists, than the Park Service and academic scientists.
30:39
That eventually convinced me not to work for the Park Service,
30:43
because that was my goal.
30:44
There was a real good idea going at the Smokies at the time.
30:50
Let’s have our management based on science and not just guess
30:56
things, which had been going on.
30:58
Or ignore things, there aren’t problems, which they were doing.
31:02
So, it became very apparent through the years, the Park Service was actually
31:09
more applied than the Forest Service.
31:12
The Forest Service research program was big enough that there were applied
31:17
people, but there was basic research going on which eventually had applications.
31:23
But they were not obsessed with applications, and the Park
31:27
Service tended to be very oriented towards putting out brush fires.
31:36
I’ll give you an example, and I hope this isn’t too unfair.
31:39
I’ll
31:43
use this example from the Smokies.
31:45
The wild boar were a major problem, but they spent more time studying
31:50
about the wild boar, which they could almost do nothing about, than studying
31:54
the vegetation they were damaging.
31:57
In other words, they weren’t documenting what the vegetation was like at all.
32:03
In some cases, it was lost through the boar.
32:07
So, they just couldn’t see the big picture.
32:11
We could never, for example, sell them on the idea that they should
32:16
have a map of the vegetation.
32:18
For the Smokies, that’s important because it’s one of the most important
32:21
parks in terms of vegetation in the U.S. It’s known for its vegetation.
32:27
But we had to kind of bootleg every vegetation study we did.
32:33
It was really something.
32:35
Whereas, that kind of thing
32:39
was going on regularly in the National Forest Service, where if you need to know
32:45
the vegetation types to monitor or manage it, let’s get a map of the vegetation.
32:51
It was too much of a reach for the Park Service.
32:57
I would say the connection of the Forest Service to the academics was much,
33:02
much stronger than the Park Service.
33:05
Had you had much interaction with Forest Service before?
33:07
No.
33:08
It was very ironic, as I would have envisioned that the Forest Service
33:12
would be all into just application.
33:15
How do we cut trees better and plant them better?
33:19
But there were other things, too, and it was very impressive.
33:25
Maybe we could shift the focus a little bit here.
33:27
At the time you started working with Jerry, I’m assuming your work was focused,
33:33
some of it at the Andrews, in that period.
33:35
Is that right?
33:37
For my Ph.D. work?
33:38
No?
33:39
No, actually it wasn’t.
33:40
It was focused at Cascade Head and the Olympic National Park.
33:44
Yeah, you mentioned that.
33:44
I thought you might have been down there.
33:46
When was the first time you started working at the Andrews?
33:48
It was about ‘84.
33:52
Okay.
33:53
I’d taken trips, of course, and been around there.
33:55
But it was about ‘84 or maybe
34:00
midway through ‘83.
34:01
But really starting in ‘84.
34:06
Maybe you could think back and give me your impressions of that experimental
34:09
forest compared with other places you’ve been, like Cascade Head or some
34:16
of the others?
34:17
Well, it was not as pristine as, say, Olympic National Park.
34:22
But there was lots of old growth.
34:23
It was a very interesting place.
34:25
The facilities were pretty primitive at the time,
34:32
but they were acceptable.
34:34
They had trailers, they weren’t as bad as what some of the
34:36
earlier people put up with.
34:39
So,
34:44
the way it sort of happened, was I finished my field work for my Ph.D., and
34:53
an opportunity came to take a post-doc, basically, on wood decomposition.
34:59
I was interested in that because of the fire/fuel issue in Glacier.
35:03
And I did some of that work in Smokies.
35:07
I’d been out with population work on logs with seedlings of trees, and I thought,
35:13
I really want to go into ecosystem work, so this is a perfect entree.
35:19
Most of my early time there was spent driving around looking
35:22
for study sites, trying to get a sense of where things were.
35:27
So, I remember being impressed with the forests themselves.
35:32
They were definitely drier than Cascade Head or
35:38
the Olympics.
35:39
So, they weren’t quite as green; they seemed kind of brown to me.
35:44
I remember being impressed with some of the areas that had been cut; how much
35:48
had been cut, particularly on the sort of north-facing part of the Andrews.
35:58
It was quite an adventure.
36:01
I’d just get in the car and go around to all these roads and these unlocked gates,
36:04
and hope I didn’t drive down a landslide chute or something, and just look around.
36:09
I covered most of the Andrews on foot during that period.
36:16
Was there any kind of a check-in system or anything?
36:19
Someone who kept track of where you were going and what you were doing?
36:22
Not really.
36:27
We really didn’t have something like that.
36:29
Where did you stay at the time?
36:31
They had trailers there.
36:34
Some of them are still there.
36:44
The big multi-storied, two-storied quads, those sites had trailers.
36:48
We’d stay at those.
36:48
You’d check in, let people know which trailer you were in.
36:53
Where you went in the Andrews, you were pretty much on your own?
36:55
No one went with you?
36:57
Sometime I went with Art, because Art knew a lot of things and he
37:01
was very interested in the project.
37:03
Actually, we did spend a lot of time when I was looking for places to put
37:08
logs, because this was really to set up this long-term log decay study.
37:12
I kind of did that on my own.
37:14
But, when I was looking for trees to use in the study, Art went out with me because
37:21
he just knew where certain things were.
37:24
If I needed cedars, he knew where to go for cedars.
37:28
Once he identified it, I’d do more work on my own.
37:31
But, it wasn’t that far off the road, and relatively safe.
37:37
A different era than today.
37:42
Who offered you the full scholarship?
37:43
Jerry did.
37:47
One thing they sold in the LTER was the idea of doing a
37:51
long-term decay study on logs.
37:56
One of Jerry’s approaches, and it’s been effective, is to find sort
37:59
of “gee-whiz” science projects.
38:02
And this was a definite, “Oh my God!” You know, “They must be crazy,
38:07
but maybe not,” kind of project.
38:11
So, in the LTER proposals, they said, “If you want a long-term project,
38:16
we’ve got one for you.” We’ll just put out logs for a couple hundred years.
38:20
And that’s about as far as it went.
38:22
Of course, they made good arguments about why it was important to do that, but the
38:26
thinking behind it was not well-developed.
38:29
Uh-huh.
38:29
They kind of knew what species they wanted, but that was about it.
38:33
I was hired to take that on, develop the study, install it, and write a
38:39
review, or help write a review, let’s put it that way, of the functions
38:44
of coarse wood in forest ecosystems.
38:47
So, a lot of my time in ‘83-’84 and about half of ‘85, was writing that
38:57
review and getting it together.
39:01
You were still finishing your Ph.D. at that time?
39:02
I was still finishing my Ph.D. Actually, I finished my Ph.D.
39:06
after I finished that review.
39:07
That added a year-and-a-half to my work.
39:11
I had first drafts of all my chapters ready, and it was a matter of getting
39:17
back to them and correcting them, and getting them in shape for the defense.
39:22
It
39:25
[dissertation] had all been written in ‘83 or so.
39:27
So, you didn’t see this as too much disruption?
39:30
Not really, but there were times when I wondered when on earth I was going to
39:35
get back to it and really finish it up.
39:39
I was very busy, and learning an awful lot about the subject at that time.
39:47
While you were doing work on
39:51
the log study, what
39:54
was your level of interaction with other staff or other personnel at the Andrews
39:58
besides Art, in off-hours, or whenever?
40:02
At the Andrews site?
40:03
At the site.
40:04
Well, I got to meet John Moreau and work with him.
40:07
He was real helpful, and was the main person.
40:13
I worked with John Moreau [HJA field technician for decades] mostly.
40:15
There weren’t many people there; mainly Fred Bierlmaier and John Moreau.
40:23
Once things got hopping, I worked with Don Nielly who built a lot of gizmos
40:28
and a drying oven, and things like that.
40:31
He was the main person at that point.
40:33
Did you have any contact with people with the district [Blue River] down there?
40:38
Actually, we did.
40:39
I should have mentioned
40:44
that.
40:44
Once we convinced them that the project should be installed,
40:47
we did a number of things, and they were very helpful on that.
40:53
I’m trying to remember the different people.
40:58
First of all, we discussed an overall strategy, because this
41:01
was literally a crazy idea.
41:04
To take sound trees, cut them down, drag them out into the woods and stick them
41:09
out to rot, was, you know, “Oh my God.” So, we decided on a number of things.
41:15
We contacted people in the forest industry, and we had them go out
41:21
and look at the sites, and talk with them about the feasibility.
41:26
Could they do certain things?
41:30
Would someone bid on a project like this?
41:33
That kind of thing.
41:36
Also, just to educate them in a way that this project would be
41:41
coming along, and this would be an opportunity to get some old growth.
41:45
We were going to basically have a swap of timber for work.
41:52
So,
41:55
we strategized on that.
41:57
What kind of reaction did they have?
42:00
We all kept our humor about it.
42:03
The nice thing was that this was bizarre enough, that you could
42:05
just crack jokes constantly about it, and kinda keep it light.
42:10
I
42:12
think they realized this
42:15
wasn’t a frivolous request.
42:18
Actually, that was going to be a concern.
42:21
See, the other thing was, at that time they were doing all this piling
42:25
up of unmerchantable material and yarding unmerchantable material.
42:29
And that really cost them a lot of money.
42:31
So, underneath it all, they were thinking, maybe this research
42:36
will help us stop doing that.
42:38
Because they were losing money on that big time.
42:42
Of all the many reasons that had been developed for that, the rationales
42:48
were not true, and also, they weren’t able to do anything with that material.
42:55
It wasn’t being used, it was just in the way.
42:59
And then they had to burn it.
43:02
It just cost them tons of money to move it out and burn it.
43:07
They’d rather leave it there, frankly.
43:09
So, they could see that connection.
43:12
A person I worked with a lot there was Vince Puleo.
43:15
He was the silviculturist at the time.
43:19
Vince was very important in helping me decide on the sites to take trees from,
43:25
the feasibility of getting the trees out.
43:29
He spent a lot of time, once I picked the sites, working
43:36
on how we’d actually get access to it, if we could use old roads, or new roads,
43:41
where they’d go, that kind of thing.
43:42
At that point, they [Forest Service] were very, very helpful.
43:48
I’m trying to remember who
43:52
the ranger was at the time.
43:54
It strikes me it was Jim Caswell.
43:57
I think that’s who it was.
43:58
I’ll have to check on that.
44:01
He was supportive, though, “I still think you guys are nuts.”
44:07
He was followed by Steve Eubanks.
44:17
And
44:26
Steve was such a ball of energy and was totally into the concept of
44:31
managing dead wood, and its value.
44:33
He saw this as an important experiment and he really cranked things up.
44:42
That’s when the Forest Service was very, very involved, setting up the
44:46
actual sale, and also, strategizing just how this thing would work.
44:51
I remember he developed a critical path diagram of this project.
44:59
And I think the fear was that it was just complicated and complex.
45:06
We just had to make sure that this wasn’t an embarrassment and a boondoggle.
45:10
So, we spent a lot of time asking questions, like, “What if it snows in
45:16
September?” Or, “What if something breaks down?” And, “How late can we go,” or
45:22
“How will we address this problem?” So,
45:28
as we approached, sort of the D-day, D-day for “duck day,” they really were
45:35
highly involved in the whole operation.
45:38
We
45:40
went from planning the basic experiment to how we would design it, and the Forest
45:45
Service was not too involved in that, to how were we going to deal with people who
45:51
may react poorly to this whole idea, to where we actually put it on the ground.
45:57
As that progressed, the Forest Service got more and more involved.
46:01
I was going to ask you about the people who came in from the forest industries.
46:10
Do you have any examples of people that were brought in?
46:13
Well, I can’t recall names, it was a long time ago and I’m not
46:17
real good with names, anyways.
46:21
Art would probably remember the names.
46:23
He’s great with names.
46:24
But, there was a fellow who was a representative of,
46:31
I think it was Oregon woodworkers, or something like that, or
46:35
maybe it was timber workers.
46:37
Some group, it was
46:40
an organization that represented and lobbied for them.
46:44
So, we got someone involved from that organization.
46:47
And we also had some people who actually did timber harvesting, asking them
46:55
how tight a situation could they work in.
46:59
Did you go more for local people, or did you go for people outside the local area?
47:03
No, it was mostly local.
47:05
I’m trying to remember.
47:07
I think we had someone in the McKenzie Valley come up and give us some advice.
47:14
And I know Art asked a lot of questions in terms of feasibility.
47:20
At one point, we weren’t sure how we would get these logs into the
47:25
forests, so we thought of cable systems into intact forests.
47:30
But eventually we got convinced that if we put a small load in, they
47:35
could use regular logging machinery, loaders and stuff, and they could
47:39
put the stuff almost anywhere.
47:41
And they were right, actually.
47:42
Out of five hundred logs, we had to
47:50
work on the place it went, and cut down a small tree, on just one bedding site.
47:54
They got them almost everywhere you could imagine.
47:58
Very impressive.
48:00
How long did that take?
48:01
It took a month, from the first day, from the first tree being felled,
48:05
to the last log being placed.
48:07
We really had that thing scoped out.
48:10
Any of the nightmare scenarios work out?
48:14
No.
48:14
Nothing really happened.
48:15
There were a couple days of confusion.
48:17
They had a really terrible yarder for the silver fir.
48:22
They got some cable thing that was just awful and always breaking down.
48:27
But most of it went like clockwork.
48:33
The
48:35
thing that was interesting, not only that it went so smoothly, but I’ll never forget
48:41
the first day when I went up to check on the work, and the guy who was in the
48:46
loader; I’m trying to remember his name.
48:49
Well, I forget.
48:51
But he got out of there and just cursed a blue streak.
48:55
He thought that this was just the stupidest, damn idea he ever heard of.
49:00
“What idiot came up with this?” He went on and on.
49:03
By the end of the month, they were quite proud of the work they did,
49:09
and they understood why they did it.
49:10
So, we spent a lot of time telling them, not overreacting, but just,
49:14
“Oh, all right, all right.” And explain, well, “Think about it this
49:19
way.” And they would get convinced.
49:24
Did you have any contact from the local community around there, any
49:27
feedback from them on this project?
49:28
No.
49:30
We didn’t have that at that time.
49:37
Not from the local community.
49:39
Not like today.
49:41
You couldn’t do this today.
49:43
You’d get fried.
49:48
When you were up at the Andrews, you didn’t spend much time
49:50
going down to Blue River?
49:52
[Town]
49:53
Oh, we did, but it was eating, shopping, things like that, but
49:56
not to convince the community or community leaders about this project.
50:00
That wasn’t a problem.
50:03
Actually, they weren’t that concerned.
50:04
Yeah.
50:05
Not much interest.
50:06
Not much interest at that time.
50:11
Could you just talk a little bit about your work?
50:15
I’m assuming at this point you finished placing the logs, and you moved up
50:17
to finish your other obligations.
50:19
Well, we finished up,
50:27
although it took a long time because we did an awful of work to describe
50:31
what they looked like at first.
50:35
We finished in October, and then we had sections cut off
50:38
all these logs at both ends.
50:40
We mapped them and we built some insect exposures.
50:44
It wasn’t until the end of March that I got through with all the work.
50:49
We took those cross-sections to a cooler down at Blue River [Ranger
50:54
Station] they used for tree seedlings.
50:56
It was about 16 feet deep and 10 feet wide and 15 feet high, or something like that.
51:02
We had that thing full of wood “cookies.” Full.
51:07
I mean, you could barely get the door shut.
51:08
So, you had to do all this laboratory work after that, and that took forever.
51:16
I was going to ask about that because it’s kind of a critical point in your career;
51:22
this long-term study.
51:28
I assume you were looking for outlets and ways to explain this
51:32
to the scientific community.
51:34
Well, mostly, it was to take them out there and show them what we did.
51:38
Is that right?
51:38
That was the most convincing thing.
51:40
And we would say, yeah, that’s the main thing.
51:46
It’s sorta like, “My god, what have they done?”
51:50
And it was pretty hard to convince people early on.
51:55
Although for the more basic scientists it was enough of a “gee whiz” thing that
52:00
they didn’t think about it practically.
52:02
They just thought, “Wow, what a set up.” You can really understand what’s going on
52:08
here, and really follow what’s going on.
52:12
But, there were lots of skeptics at that time.
52:17
So,
52:21
it was important to convince people about how it would actually play out,
52:29
and that took a lot of imagination.
52:32
It
52:36
didn’t bother me because I’d worked with permanent plots for forest growth, and
52:41
some of them we’d been working on had been tagged and measured for 50, 60, 70 years,
52:47
and I realized that unless those people didn’t put those tags out originally, we
52:52
wouldn’t be doing what we were doing now.
52:54
We wouldn’t have all that information.
52:56
To me it wasn’t that different.
52:57
The only difference was, instead of the trees just growing on their own, we
53:02
actually had to put these things out.
53:04
We couldn’t just go with what was there, and not have a good experiment.
53:12
So that just struck me as a no-brainer.
53:15
People make fun of it, but as it becomes older, it’s going to
53:19
become an important resource.
53:21
If they can’t see it now; that’s their problem, it’s not my problem.
53:25
Then the other thing I realized, was that it wasn’t enough to put out a bunch
53:29
of logs and say, “gee whiz.” You had to have some pretty tight hypotheses.
53:35
So actually, before I ever went down to the Andrews, I spent a lot of time just
53:39
thinking what those would be, and how they would sort of lead to a model of decay.
53:49
I remember some people wondering when I’d get down to the Andrews finally,
53:53
because I spent a lot of time laying on my couch in Portland, staring at
53:56
the ceiling thinking about things.
53:59
Coming up with and then actually doing some small little models on my
54:05
calculator, and graphically coming up with some ideas I thought would be very
54:10
strong and stand the tests of time.
54:13
Be very basic with strong hypotheses.
54:15
Uh-huh.
54:18
So, I had done that, and I felt secure about that.
54:22
We weren’t just saying, well, they decay or they don’t decay.
54:25
We were saying, why are these species different.
54:28
We think they’re different because of the following reasons.
54:31
We think size is different because of these reasons.
54:35
We had some real solid hypotheses there.
54:41
Some of the comments were hard to take, but that didn’t bother me.
54:46
There was this sort of background.
54:49
I was convinced that it was an important thing to do and
54:52
we were doing the right thing.
54:54
So, I could always fall back on that.
54:56
So, the concept of the long-term study was something that was already familiar enough
55:01
academically for you and for other people.
55:04
To me, although I must say, at that time, the value of long-term studies
55:08
in ecological work was still up in the
55:13
air.
55:14
In the last five years, there’s just been no question about it.
55:17
There’s been enough results from enough fields that people realize
55:22
that a lot of short-term results are off, and just misleading.
55:27
That you have to actually look at it in a longer framework or you
55:31
don’t know what the results mean.
55:35
But at that time it wasn’t necessarily clear.
55:38
We got lots of comments like, “Two-hundred year study, that’s a long
55:42
time to wait for results” and, “You’ll be dead.” Nice things like that.
55:48
Other things like, “Well, the world’s going to blow up
55:51
anyways,” which is ridiculous.
55:54
I’ll tell you, one of the hardest criticisms we got was from our dean
56:00
of the [OSU] College of Forestry, who I sat across from at the dinner
56:06
after I’d shown the site to people.
56:09
And he just basically said, “This is the most stupid f-ing thing I’d ever heard
56:18
of in my life.” And then I had to finish my meal, sitting across from this guy.
56:22
It was like so unsupportive, it was incredible.
56:25
That was Stoltenberg?
56:27
[Carl Stoltenberg]
56:28
Stoltenberg.
56:29
A real........supporter of ecological work, I must say.
56:34
Did he say anything after that, or was that the end of it?
56:37
You know, it was a little hard to speak.
56:38
Fortunately, there were other people around, so they talked,
56:41
but I was just kind of speechless.
56:44
I was still a graduate student.
56:45
Sure.
56:47
And hardly secure at that, getting that
56:53
kind of abuse.
56:53
But afterwards people said, “Well, what do you expect getting from Carl?”
57:00
So, I came up with a series of thoughts.
57:05
Okay, are we going to wait two hundred years for results?
57:09
I realized that really what this study does is provide a temporal
57:13
backbone, in a way, to get an analogy.
57:16
At
57:18
times you’ll learn about the early phases, and you’ll do all kinds
57:23
of experiments and observations.
57:26
And you’ll do the long-term measurements later.
57:30
What we’ll do is provide a linkage in time of all these studies.
57:34
So, it’s a way to link short-term studies.
57:36
In fact, it’s just a series of linked short-term studies.
57:40
You’d have to be an idiot to wait two hundred years.
57:43
And we were not idiots.
57:44
We were gonna keep working on this.
57:46
Hmm.
57:50
To flash forward twelve years, we had people from an LTER
57:56
meeting come out this spring.
58:01
These people had come out ten years before when the logs looked fresh,
58:08
and they were curious about the study.
58:11
When they came back out, I was really amazed how interested in it they
58:17
were.
58:17
“How do you do these kinds of long-term studies?” and “What have you learned?”
58:20
They were not just interested in the results, but how it started, “How
58:25
did that work?” They thought it was a good example of planning ahead.
58:30
It was only 5% through its lifespan, and already, people had turned
58:36
around to see what it was doing.
58:38
I gather it wasn’t hard to get people to come out there and look at this.
58:41
There was a lot of interest in this.
58:42
Well, there was that, plus we had it integrated into a general tour.
58:47
This wasn’t the only study going on at the Andrews, so we had tours on
58:51
many different things, and this was probably one of the highlights, I guess.
58:56
At least, in a “bizarro” sense. You could say you went and you saw
59:00
where the “insane” people were.
59:05
As you were designing this study, were there any models of previous
59:09
long-term studies that you may have looked at that you considered?
59:12
Mostly it was analogies to growth and yield plots that we had worked on.
59:20
Because at that time, even litter decay, like leaves and small
59:25
things, a long study was a year.
59:29
People hadn’t even acknowledged that even that took decades.
59:32
So, there weren’t many decomposition experiments that
59:35
went beyond a year or two.
59:37
In fact, there was one published that was five years long, or maybe
59:42
it was just two years long, and that was outstanding, fantastic.
59:46
Seen as a real long-term study.
59:49
Kind of a joke now.
59:50
It was good work, but I mean, two years is a joke in terms of that process.
59:54
Were there any particular growth and yield studies that worked out?
59:58
No, that it was just with Jerry, you see, the great thing about
1:00:16
analogous things, how those studies influenced my thinking
1:00:22
on it in the long-term.
1:00:23
One of them was Jerry’s involvement with students, and my involvement in
1:00:29
making measurements in forest plots.
1:00:32
With Jerry, you don’t just do your thesis work.
1:00:34
He’ll dragoon you into working on the measurement or establishment of a
1:00:40
plot or something else in the forest.
1:00:44
I could see the value of a long-term view of succession.
1:00:48
We actually had data on how things change.
1:00:50
You weren’t making things up, you were actually measuring it.
1:00:53
It was very interesting.
1:00:55
So, I just thought of it as kind of the inverse process, and
1:01:00
I’ll study how things disappear.
1:01:05
While you were getting into the study, you were finishing up your
1:01:09
dissertation, probably thinking ahead to
1:01:13
what you were going to do next.
1:01:13
Was there something you were doing away from the Andrews that may have
1:01:17
had some bearing on your decision?
1:01:20
No, not really.
1:01:21
I realized that, if I was doing this – the logs – at this point, it was a real
1:01:27
opportunity for me, because first of all, originally Jerry was going to be
1:01:31
the senior author of the review paper.
1:01:36
But, he realized I’d done so much writing on it, and had done a more
1:01:41
thorough job than I had originally planned, that he basically thought
1:01:46
I should be the lead author.
1:01:48
I think that was at Colorado State, or somewhere, he basically came up and
1:01:53
said, “Well, you should really be the author on this.” Because, I’d presented
1:01:58
a general review of what we’d been finding at that time to the ESA [Annual
1:02:08
meeting of the Ecological Society of America] . I realized at that time that
1:02:10
hardly anyone was doing work in this field outside this region, and people who
1:02:15
had been doing the work, Jerry, Kermit Cromack, and Phil Sollins, were eventually
1:02:21
going to pass on the mantle. They
1:02:25
were viewing that review paper as kind of the end of what they’d found, and
1:02:30
I was viewing it as the beginning.
1:02:32
So, it was a real good way to sort of pass the baton.
1:02:36
I
1:02:38
interacted with a lot of people who did the work on that, the basic
1:02:42
work on that, and many of them, no most, are authors on that paper.
1:02:47
So, I realized it was just a total opening, plus I realized
1:02:50
it was such a basic question.
1:02:56
You could develop all kinds of things.
1:02:59
Also, in terms of things to study, it’s like a mini-ecosystem.
1:03:02
Lots of times we have a hard time measuring what’s
1:03:05
going on in a big ecosystem.
1:03:07
But, this was like a little, mini-ecosystem.
1:03:09
You could do experiments on it.
1:03:12
You could measure all the things you could measure on an ecosystem,
1:03:19
only easier.
1:03:20
You could explore all the ideas about ecosystems in this little system.
1:03:27
To me, that just seemed very appealing.
1:03:28
I thought, “Great, let’s do it.”
1:03:32
Would it be accurate to say at that point your research began to
1:03:34
focus more narrowly on the Andrews?
1:03:37
Yes.
1:03:37
And you have a long-term investment.
1:03:41
Yes.
1:03:41
After having set it up and all that, and done the review, I’d sort of bought
1:03:46
into all that before I really got going.
1:03:49
Once I’d decided I was going on it, and I could see in the review, all
1:03:54
these areas that were open for research that just had not been done, that
1:03:58
had not really been thought about.
1:04:00
Now, this is also about the time that Jerry leaves, isn’t it?
1:04:03
Yes, he left for sabbatical, a Bullard fellowship at Harvard Forest about the
1:04:13
Spring of ‘85, something like that.
1:04:17
We had pretty much gotten all the planning done, and he left.
1:04:24
He, ironically, wasn’t there to see the thing set up.
1:04:26
I kind of regret that because he really pushed it and had the idea originally, and
1:04:33
was so supportive in many aspects of getting the study going.
1:04:40
So, that was actually all set up by the time he got back.
1:04:45
And at that time he then started negotiating about his future position.
1:04:49
There were a lot of people that wanted Jerry at that time.
1:04:52
The University of Washington was a very strong contender.
1:04:57
So, I think by ‘86 or ‘87,
1:05:04
he’d left.
1:05:04
Yeah, it was ‘86.
1:05:06
Yeah.
1:05:07
Well, he actually spent a lot of time here in the first year or two.
1:05:13
You know, in transition.
1:05:15
It was ‘86 when we had a renewal and I think
1:05:19
that’s when Fred
1:05:26
took over, about then.
1:05:28
So, there was a little overlap between Jerry and Fred.
1:05:33
So at that point,
1:05:36
sounds like you were essentially in the lead on this project.
1:05:41
Yeah.
1:05:41
Actually, it started real early.
1:05:44
I was brought in as this post-doc, as a pre-post-doc,
1:05:48
let’s say, to the LTER, and at
1:05:51
that point, they just put it into my hands.
1:05:54
You design the experiment.
1:05:56
I got very involved with the PIs at that point.
1:05:58
They were very good, I mean, there was none of this, you’re a junior peon.
1:06:04
They were like, okay, tell us what you think should happen.
1:06:08
They put a lot of responsibility in my hands.
1:06:13
And they also allowed me to explain this to not only them, but we had
1:06:21
an advisory board, we still do, but they were very active at that time.
1:06:26
So, in at least two or three of these meetings, I explained at
1:06:30
least the thinking behind this experiment and how it’s progressing.
1:06:33
At that time I really get exposed to the overall LTER project, because
1:06:39
I’d sit in on all the meetings as well as presenting my own stuff.
1:06:43
And they were very open.
1:06:44
It was very nice.
1:06:46
So, you were pretty well into the administrative decisions, for example,
1:06:54
hiring staff or getting contracts?
1:06:57
Well, some.
1:06:59
I had a pretty small budget and we did a lot with volunteers.
1:07:02
And the work for setting it up was done through this contract
1:07:07
with the Forest Service.
1:07:12
Even at that point, I wasn’t that involved in the budgets or anything.
1:07:16
It was a pretty small part of LTER at that point.
1:07:21
At what level were you involved with identifying the personnel for the project?
1:07:27
There weren’t any!
1:07:29
There weren’t any?
1:07:30
Yes.
1:07:32
I was everything.
1:07:33
I mean, any head technicians, like Jack Booth, for example, and John Moreau.
1:07:38
When we needed them, we would have them available and work
1:07:45
on it.
1:07:45
I recruited my wife to help around here.
1:07:49
I had a technician from some Park Service-related stuff;
1:07:53
I dragooned her into it.
1:07:55
I had a lot of volunteers.
1:07:58
The Stream Team, for example, when we needed bunches of people in the field,
1:08:02
they would just show up that day with ten people and say, “Tell us what to
1:08:06
do.” So, a lot of it got done, not by hiring a big staff, but actually
1:08:11
just coordinating what we already had.
1:08:14
I see.
1:08:15
You mentioned your wife.
1:08:18
Was she working in this field also?
1:08:21
No.
1:08:23
We met in Tennessee and got married just before we came out.
1:08:27
And she got a job with the Army Corp of Engineers, and she lived in Portland.
1:08:31
So, I lived in Portland and commuted, and sometimes, I had a place down here.
1:08:37
That was just getting to be undoable, and we wanted to have a child, and
1:08:43
got tired of not living together.
1:08:44
So, we got a place in Corvallis, she quit her job and then,
1:08:51
she spent about six, seven months helping me get this study set up, working for me.
1:08:59
You mentioned her name?
1:09:00
Jan, Jan Harmon.
1:09:06
Eventually, I had to pay her back for that effort on her own project.
1:09:10
She had a project that in `87
1:09:16
involved riparian vegetation seed banks, and she had our son
1:09:24
just as these seeds were sprouting.
1:09:28
So, I spent several months watering her seedlings for her and recording
1:09:33
data for her, to pay her back.
1:09:35
Was it an LTER?
1:09:36
No, actually it was done through the
1:09:40
riparian grant on which Stan Gregory, Art McKee and Jerry Franklin, and
1:09:47
I think, Fred was on that, too.
1:09:49
Yeah, Fred was on that.
1:09:50
Gordon Grant also.
1:09:51
A whole bunch of people on that.
1:09:54
So, she did a seed bank study on that.
1:09:57
I paid her back a couple months later, about
1:10:02
five.
1:10:04
In terms of the people who worked directly on that study with you,
1:10:07
though, it was mostly people who were already connected with the group,
1:10:11
and they just kind of reallocated the resources already existing?
1:10:12
Yes.
1:10:17
I guess there was one part that wasn’t that way.
1:10:19
During June of `85, we set up a stream, sort of a mini-study, in
1:10:26
which we took logs that were only about two meters long and a small
1:10:30
diameter, so people could pick them up.
1:10:32
And we put them in a stream, and we put them in an upland area.
1:10:35
That was kind of a small-scale version of this thing.
1:10:40
We built our own logging systems, and it was funny.
1:10:43
We had a skyline system made out of cable and it ran off of an
1:10:50
electric winch down this frame.
1:10:53
We had a yarding system that was run off of a pickup that ran up and down the road.
1:10:58
Jack Booth developed all that and that was kinda fun.
1:11:01
In that case, we actually had ten or so volunteers.
1:11:07
At that time, the Andrews had a summer volunteer program to do vegetation
1:11:12
measurements and other things.
1:11:13
Now we use summer technicians.
1:11:17
But then, we were using these volunteers.
1:11:20
So, they spent their first month putting in this study.
1:11:25
They were recruited by Art McKee.
1:11:30
He had them available for all kinds of projects, and I took advantage of them.
1:11:35
This is volunteers again?
1:11:36
Yeah.
1:11:37
Student volunteers.
1:11:38
A lot of them were students, people in-between school,
1:11:41
wanted more experience in
1:11:47
ecology kind of work, and we’d give it to them.
1:11:51
We gave them food, plus a
1:11:55
stipend, mostly.
1:11:55
Were those mostly local students?
1:11:55
No.
1:11:55
From all over.
1:11:58
Really?
1:11:58
All over.
1:11:58
I’ve seen some of them since.
1:12:03
Someone from New York, for example.
1:12:06
Some were local, and some were from all over.
1:12:08
They recruited nationally.
1:12:10
Art had?
1:12:11
Yeah, I think he did.
1:12:24
I’m curious about the networks that students get.
1:12:28
At that point, that’s what we were doing.
1:12:29
We were going with these volunteers.
1:12:33
I was taking a resource of people that was there, and organizing them to do the job.
1:12:38
But I wasn’t literally recruiting at that
1:12:42
time.
1:12:43
That sounds like one of the few times that you actually brought
1:12:45
people in physically for the job.
1:12:47
Yeah.
1:12:49
How
1:13:01
you would characterize the changes in the structure, focus, and priorities of the
1:13:05
group since you first became involved?
1:13:11
The LTER group?
1:13:13
Yeah, right.
1:13:17
The first period was focused on two things; setting up
1:13:23
some observation systems.
1:13:25
This is in streams as well as in the uplands.
1:13:28
You know, they put in a whole series of blocks, in the Hagan Block
1:13:31
[west of HJA EF] watershed, too.
1:13:34
It was consolidating the measurement system.
1:13:38
I think Stan was doing stuff in Mack Creek and several other places.
1:13:45
But the other thing was long-term experiments.
1:13:48
That was the focus.
1:13:49
The sort of ultimate, long-term experiment was the log one.
1:13:54
But there was one on snowbrush [Ceanothus velutinus] that
1:13:56
Phil Sollins was in charge of.
1:13:59
There was one Dave Perry had on stand-thinning, but it was
1:14:03
really young-stand development.
1:14:08
At that time Stan was setting up for a stream manipulation experiment, and I
1:14:13
think it was in the Hagan Block, in which they would actually change the amount of
1:14:18
woody debris in the stream and the nature of the forest cover, and set that up.
1:14:25
Those were the ones I recall.
1:14:28
There may have been others, but those seemed like the main ones.
1:14:31
So, it was very experimental in nature, long-term experiments.
1:14:37
Several of them involved woody debris.
1:14:40
Obviously, the log decay on the riparian manipulation involved it as well.
1:14:47
And nitrogen fixation, that was the other thing that was key.
1:14:50
A lot of those got set up, like the snow brush experiment.
1:14:56
Dave Perry got his young stands thinned, manipulated and fertilized.
1:15:01
One of them, the stream manipulation, never got going
1:15:06
because of environmental concerns.
1:15:10
It just never became viable.
1:15:12
So, it just basically turned into a long-term monitoring project of the
1:15:16
stream, because they were getting background, or pre-treatment data.
1:15:26
When you say environmental concerns, what do you mean by that?
1:15:27
At that time, it was in a road-less area review process [RARE 2, which
1:15:31
limited logging as areas were studied for possible exclusion from
1:15:31
further roading] . So, there became a concern about developing it.
1:15:38
Should it really be developed?
1:15:41
The answer basically came down, “No.” That’s probably not worth sacrificing
1:15:47
this area for this experiment.
1:15:49
Also, the public was becoming more and more concerned about this issue.
1:15:54
So the whole national forest plan, the five-year plan that took ten
1:16:00
years to develop, or whatever it was,
1:16:04
was starting to really heat up at that point.
1:16:12
That got abandoned.
1:16:13
Of those four [research and monitoring projects] , the ones that
1:16:16
are really active now are Dave’s young stand one and the log study.
1:16:21
The snowbrush study, although it started off quite well, the
1:16:26
plants we were interested in studying, really didn’t show up.
1:16:30
We don’t know why.
1:16:32
I think Phil will really talk to you about that.
1:16:34
But it just didn’t materialize the way we thought so, most of our treatments
1:16:39
weren’t treatments we expected to study.
1:16:42
Are you speculating it was the elk?
1:16:45
I’m not sure we know, but I think that’s as good of an idea there is right now.
1:16:55
It sure developed differently than an adjacent stand that’s not very far from
1:16:58
there, that’s completely different.
1:17:00
Then it
1:17:02
was experiments, big experiments, long-term experiments.
1:17:06
We struggled with the idea of adding more in LTER 2, so at that point,
1:17:13
I actually contributed a proposal.
1:17:15
I wrote the stuff on logs.
1:17:19
I was still a graduate student at that point.
1:17:22
But I kind of knew that inside and out, and we developed an idea that
1:17:30
maybe we should look at several things.
1:17:32
We should look at long-term site productivity.
1:17:40
I think that was viewed as something that would come on board late
1:17:45
in LTER 2, if I remember right.
1:17:49
And Dave Perry, well actually, it wasn’t clear who was running
1:17:52
that project at that time.
1:17:55
It’s always been a bit of a problem with that project, probably because
1:17:59
it involves so many disciplines, but it led to some problems.
1:18:08
We had this endless debate about adding in a thing called the “Phoenix Project,”
1:18:15
which was another one of Jerry’s “let’s do something big and bold and
1:18:21
exciting,” in which we were going to torch off a big area of the Andrews.
1:18:27
I don’t know how big, but a clear patch of a catastrophic fire, so we could actually
1:18:32
look at catastrophic fire effects.
1:18:33
That was actually a neat idea.
1:18:37
But, in the meantime, mother- nature has actually burned up plenty for us.
1:18:41
But, it was kind of, “Let’s do some pretty wild work,” but it never crystallized.
1:18:45
It just never crystallized.
1:18:47
And I think, that was maybe a bit of a glimpse of what was going to
1:18:54
happen on long-term site productivity, because it was a bit more complex
1:19:00
than anybody could quite take on.
1:19:04
But the Phoenix one really sizzled, because it was very clear we
1:19:08
could never get consensus on a central idea or theme or anything.
1:19:16
Sounds kind of simple on the face of it.
1:19:18
Yeah.
1:19:19
They both sound simple, but
1:19:23
that one was very risky in terms of the resource.
1:19:26
Would we burn up the Andrews?
1:19:28
Plus, it just was not coalescing.
1:19:33
Too many cooks were in that soup than it took to do it.
1:19:37
Right.
1:19:38
It ended up tasting like nothing.
1:19:40
Gray paste.
1:19:42
Lots of good ideas on their own, but it just was never adding up
1:19:49
to anything.
1:19:49
By the time LTER 2 got over, it was really clear, based on the budgets and
1:19:55
things that we were not going to be able to keep adding these mega-projects.
1:20:01
We were having real problems getting the ones we had, tracking, and like I
1:20:07
said, two of them sort of dropped out.
1:20:10
Not necessarily for any fault of attention, it just didn’t work out.
1:20:15
So, we were aware that they were risky.
1:20:19
Site productivity was not really working the way, I don’t
1:20:23
think, anyone had envisioned.
1:20:25
It had eaten up a huge amount of resources and we had nothing to show.
1:20:29
Very little to show for it, relative to the money that we had put into it.
1:20:35
In contrast, it took about $30,000 a year to set up, and a year-and-a-half,
1:20:42
to set up the log experiment, which was very tight and narrowly focused.
1:20:47
But, long-term site productivity, if I remember right, chewed up $70,000 for five
1:20:55
years, it still hadn’t been installed, and it wasn’t clear what they were doing.
1:21:01
It was a real contrast and I think an eye-opener to people that, gee,
1:21:06
they’re not only risky, but they’re expensive and we can’t afford it.
1:21:11
Then, another thing was coming along.
1:21:13
We had a lot of synthesis in IBP.
1:21:18
Experiments came out of LTER like the log experiment and the snowbrush
1:21:22
experiment, etc. We were going back into a period of synthesis.
1:21:28
And that really came up strong in the LTER 3 proposal.
1:21:33
We were going to start doing more modeling.
1:21:36
Our group hadn’t done modeling since
1:21:42
IBP.
1:21:42
Sort of synthetic modeling.
1:21:46
We were also realizing that a lot of these problems involved a landscape analysis.
1:21:52
They couldn’t be done as a little, teeny
1:21:56
process anymore, or even an ecosystem in the sense of a
1:22:01
stand and its nutrient cycles.
1:22:03
We had done that in IBP and it was clear we had kinda gone as far
1:22:07
as that could go, conceptually.
1:22:11
Uh-huh.
1:22:11
We needed to push it to a landscape level.
1:22:13
So, those were the challenges really laid out in LTER 3.
1:22:20
Was there a shift when all these decisions were made?
1:22:26
No.
1:22:26
I think we’d always done it by consensus.
1:22:30
The group would buy into a general issue.
1:22:33
It wasn’t always total agreement, but
1:22:37
these decisions by-and-large have been made by the group.
1:22:42
It’s been a blessing, and it’s been a curse.
1:22:44
If you had a benevolent dictator, maybe things would be more efficient.
1:22:50
But, it also brings a breadth to any decision.
1:22:55
So many aspects are considered, and
1:23:02
that’s been helpful.
1:23:04
Even budget decisions are made largely by the group.
1:23:08
This was a time, entering LTER 3, when
1:23:12
budget restrictions really were starting to show up.
1:23:15
Even though we were getting annual increases,
1:23:18
there was inflation in running projects.
1:23:23
The log study started for $30,000, but it was starting to creep up.
1:23:27
You couldn’t do anything for $30,000 a year.
1:23:33
How does the budget develop over the years?
1:23:36
Well, it started at maybe $20,000 or $30,000 a year, and it stayed that way
1:23:43
for a long time, right through LTER 2.
1:23:49
The money had to come from NSF grants.
1:23:54
There was no money.
1:23:56
I remember being so frustrated by NSF, because they kept saying this
1:24:00
was an LTER project, and I literally had to write in the proposal
1:24:05
there was only $20,000 a year.
1:24:08
That couldn’t pay for even one PI to supervise us, there
1:24:11
was no nutrient analysis being done, nothing was happening, if
1:24:16
they didn’t put this money in.
1:24:19
And they complained that I complained, but they gave us the money.
1:24:23
They thought it was outrageous, but it had gotten to that point.
1:24:27
There was a conflict in NSF and with the reviewers.
1:24:31
Some people thought LTER is getting too much money.
1:24:35
Now, as a new program with new money, they wanted that money.
1:24:39
So, whenever you came in to compete in another ecosystem program, they would
1:24:44
just dismiss your proposal out-of-hand.
1:24:49
You’ve already got too much money.
1:24:52
It’s been a long-term battle at NSF, and with the reviewers in particular.
1:24:57
They don’t understand how the money gets divided up.
1:25:01
They look at it at half a million dollars a year, or
1:25:03
whatever it is now, 560 [thousand dollars] , a lot of money per year.
1:25:06
But it’s divided among all these projects, so nobody gets anything.
1:25:14
We struggled a lot to get that funding.
1:25:19
The last couple years, as I’ve expanded out into different areas,
1:25:24
like the carbon sequestration.
1:25:27
I’ve gotten more money, but the log project still only gets
1:25:29
20-30,000 [dollars] a year.
1:25:35
Quarter-time technician.
1:25:37
That’s all that’s on LTER.
1:25:39
Everything else has to come from somewhere else.
1:25:44
In the case of that study and others you’ve been involved in, was there
1:25:47
ever a concern that you’d identified or could recognize from NSF reviewers
1:25:52
about the fact these are group decisions?
1:25:57
No.
1:25:58
I think you can make the point, at least in site reviews.
1:26:04
That doesn’t really show up so much in NSF reviews.
1:26:08
They’re mostly concerned with the science and feasibility of it.
1:26:14
I think it mystified people, but they’re very supportive of it.
1:26:20
I mean, they’re always mystified by the command structure.
1:26:23
“Who’s in charge?
1:26:24
How do decisions get made?
1:26:26
How do the people work here?
1:26:29
Draw us a flow diagram.” We never could, because it just worked.
1:26:33
Stan Gregory always used to say, “We don’t want to know how it works, because
1:26:37
we’ll break it. We’re just gonna do it.
1:26:38
We know it works.
1:26:40
Why screw around with it?” It really had to do with people.
1:26:45
People trusting each other and respecting each other.
1:26:48
And being able to disagree and yell at each other, and still be able to get in a
1:26:53
meeting the next time and talk rationally
1:26:58
to each other.
1:26:58
Did you ever encounter people who didn’t fit into that?
1:27:02
Oh, yeah.
1:27:03
That happened.
1:27:05
I think several people tried to get into the group and never were able to do it.
1:27:12
Should I name names?
1:27:14
Yeah, if you can.
1:27:15
Mark Wilson was an example.
1:27:16
He got money for quite a few years.
1:27:21
But he’d only show up when the money was handed out, he never
1:27:24
came to any meetings, and he never involved himself in the group.
1:27:30
We decided, as a group, that this was not a mini-grants program.
1:27:36
You had to be involved.
1:27:38
Mark could make a contribution, but he just wanted the money.
1:27:42
He didn’t want any strings attached to it, and that didn’t work out.
1:27:47
People did come in and ask, “Why aren’t you supporting me? I’m on soft money.
1:27:52
I need money.
1:27:53
Give me money.” And that never went over big either.
1:27:58
There’s always been a feeling that you needed to make an investment in the group.
1:28:03
The group will try and look after you as best it can, and it’s been
1:28:07
harder, as the budget’s been fixed.
1:28:08
Kathy Whitlock
1:28:12
would be an example recently, where
1:28:17
we can’t afford to pay her salary, but we can do things, like get her to important
1:28:21
meetings, especially LTER meetings, so that she can contribute to the community.
1:28:28
That’s kind of what we’re restricted to doing now.
1:28:30
But, there’s always been that, “You buy into the system, you invest in
1:28:35
it, you tell us about your work, make it part of our thinking, and
1:28:41
you’re part of the group.” That’s the only real admission price.
1:28:47
You’re
1:28:49
talking about going to meetings, site visits, group tours, things
1:28:56
like that?
1:28:56
Yeah.
1:28:56
Things like that.
1:29:02
Some people are put off by that.
1:29:04
They don’t want to make that investment, they can’t make that investment, or
1:29:08
they’re not sure it’s going to pay off.
1:29:13
Can you think of any reasons or hurdles that might discourage
1:29:17
people from doing that?
1:29:20
Well,
1:29:28
first of all, the funding’s gotten so tight recently, that you really
1:29:34
have to go after a sure thing.
1:29:35
There are not many things you can go after that are high risk anymore.
1:29:41
Even at NSF, the success rate is 20% on average, and some programs, it’s 10%.
1:29:50
You just cannot afford that time when you’re writing maybe 10 proposals a year.
1:29:57
Because you also have to publish.
1:29:58
So, the soft money people just can’t afford to do that anymore.
1:30:04
You can no longer be on only one proposal.
1:30:07
The amounts have gone down and the success rate has gone down.
1:30:09
So, you have to be working on four or five [grants] at once for funding.
1:30:16
But, that’s grant writing, you mean?
1:30:17
Yeah, grant writing.
1:30:19
You just have to go with things you’re sure of.
1:30:28
Even if you’re success rate is 50%, which is really good, five times the average.
1:30:34
Say, at that rate, you gotta work on two or three solid proposals a year.
1:30:43
That’s a lot, if you have to do all these other things.
1:30:46
So, I think that’s a real restriction now.
1:30:49
There are several people I’d like to involve, and I think I can involve them.
1:30:55
Or the group would involve them.
1:30:56
It’s actually been a group discussion, particularly in the physiology of plants.
1:31:01
We haven’t had anyone doing that for 20 years at the Andrews.
1:31:09
Not really, since Dick Waring dropped out, and he’s not really a physiologist.
1:31:16
It’s really been the IBP days since physiology’s been done.
1:31:19
So,
1:31:22
getting someone involved
1:31:25
would cost $20-30,000 a year, for a student to do the work.
1:31:34
We don’t have that kind of money anymore
1:31:37
Does a connection with the LTER group here tend to increase the chances
1:31:45
of getting funding, do you think?
1:31:46
I don’t know.
1:31:47
I think on some fronts, yes.
1:31:49
I think it doesn’t hurt you anymore.
1:31:52
I think it hurt for a while, now I think it doesn’t really hurt so much.
1:31:55
I was just asking because you mentioned the case of that person
1:32:02
coming in looking for money, but not being real involved with the group.
1:32:06
Well, no.
1:32:07
I think some people didn’t understand what the program was about.
1:32:11
They thought it was sort of easy, that NSF gave the LTER grants, then LTERs
1:32:19
gave out grants, too.
1:32:22
It was never supposed to operate that way.
1:32:25
To complete a thought, because we got a little bit sidetracked, for LTER
1:32:31
4, you were talking about progression, and on LTER 3, we
1:32:35
struggled with synthesis, endlessly.
1:32:39
We knew the direction we wanted to go.
1:32:43
We weren’t quite sure how to do it; there was a lot of internal
1:32:46
strife about how to do it.
1:32:51
We were pursuing “holy grails,” like a grand synthesis. Maybe there
1:32:57
was one, and there might be, but it is kind of a “holy grail” pursuit.
1:33:04
While
1:33:07
we weren’t very productive in synthesis per se, I think we learned
1:33:11
a lot more about what we needed to do and how to approach it.
1:33:17
By LTER 4, which is also geared towards synthesis, it’s much more
1:33:23
focused and has particular areas that are going to be explored.
1:33:28
They’re very specific and they have specific hypotheses,
1:33:31
so the direction is there.
1:33:37
There are the encompassing questions.
1:33:41
It allows these things to fit underneath
1:33:47
it.
1:33:47
It’s not like deep-think, or whatever it is, like in Hitchhiker’s Guide
1:33:50
[to the Galaxy] , that cranks out 49 or something after five years.
1:33:56
We don’t think there’s some ultimate answer there.
1:33:59
We’ve sort of given up on that for a while.
1:34:01
Is there a turning point?
1:34:03
Or are there different personalities involved now, or is
1:34:05
it simply in the process of that?
1:34:07
No, there are different personalities involved.
1:34:11
Phil Sollins tried very hard to lead the synthesis effort.
1:34:22
I think he’d admit he wasn’t able to do it.
1:34:26
Part of it was, I think, this baggage of the “holy grail.”
1:34:30
Part of it came to personality.
1:34:38
I think Phil loved working with big groups, but he’s hard
1:34:42
to work with in big groups.
1:34:44
He has a very strong personality, and
1:34:48
he enjoys the fight.
1:34:49
He enjoys the process.
1:34:51
Let’s put it that way.
1:34:52
And it doesn’t bother him to revisit questions a lot.
1:34:56
A lot of us, however, don’t relish the process of meetings.
1:35:00
I mean, we want the meetings to actually lead somewhere, not to more debate.
1:35:07
That was a big conflict.
1:35:09
And I think, he basically, on his own decision, decided to drop
1:35:17
his participation and to back off from that synthesis area.
1:35:21
So now, instead of a grand synthesis, we have different
1:35:25
people leading the different areas.
1:35:31
There are four.
1:35:33
Thinking about it, Phil was trying to lead those four, and probably another four.
1:35:38
I don’t think anyone could really achieve it.
1:35:42
Also, there were some personality problems.
1:35:44
I think, it needed somebody who would push it in a direction with a sense that
1:35:52
you were getting something done, and that was just not happening with Phil.
1:35:57
A question occurred to me while you were going through
1:36:00
your progression from 2 to 3.
1:36:04
You were talking about the Phoenix Project,
1:36:10
things that got started and didn’t quite gel somehow.
1:36:14
I was curious about the decision-making process in that.
1:36:18
Was there kind of a decision point?
1:36:22
Well, I think in the Phoenix Project, it was very clear to everybody,
1:36:28
we were not making progress.
1:36:29
It kind of faded away.
1:36:32
We did have some decisions, nice discussions, but we’re going nowhere on
1:36:40
this.
1:36:40
This does not happen on long-term site productivity, and this is probably
1:36:45
going to hurt some people’s feelings, but I think it was very poorly-managed.
1:36:51
It was poorly-managed by the group, because when progress wasn’t
1:36:56
made, we were not hard enough as a group to cut out funding.
1:37:01
We would always give it another chance, which just meant
1:37:04
that the same thing happened.
1:37:07
And that was a very, very painful experience for the group, because
1:37:13
they didn’t want to be hard-asses, but they probably needed to be hard-asses.
1:37:21
Originally, they wanted me to take over that project.
1:37:24
But I’d just got done with the log project and I just didn’t
1:37:27
want to be the super-technician.
1:37:29
I really wanted to stay within that and develop it science-wise.
1:37:36
So, they had to find someone to do it, and at one point, it was run
1:37:42
by Phil Sollins, Joe Means in the Forest Service, and Dave Perry.
1:37:53
They were hoping Joe would take it on, but Joe’s personality
1:37:57
just wasn’t right for that.
1:37:58
He’s not a great organizer, and it was a great opportunity for
1:38:04
him, but it just didn’t happen.
1:38:07
So, he kind of dropped out of it.
1:38:10
But it was kind of a slow death.
1:38:11
A lot of this thing in site productivity was like a real slow death.
1:38:16
Nothing seemed to be chopped off.
1:38:19
So, he just sort of faded away, and then Phil and Dave were running it.
1:38:28
They had some interesting ideas.
1:38:31
Phil
1:38:35
got the snowbrush study organized quite well.
1:38:40
He had shown some organizational skills, but he left for Yale
1:38:46
University at this time.
1:38:49
So, his on-site presence was not very high.
1:38:52
He was like non-existent for about two years.
1:38:56
I’ll say this for Phil, he always came back and kept us
1:38:58
informed, and he kept involved.
1:39:00
But this needed day-to-day supervision.
1:39:04
So, Dave was left doing it, and he’s not an organization man.
1:39:10
He’s a big thinker and all that, but he’s not strong in organizing experiments,
1:39:18
and he isn’t an organized person.
1:39:21
Well, they hired a post-doc.
1:39:23
Because everybody admitted this, we know what we’re all like.
1:39:28
And people owned up to it, and we were gonna hire a post-doc, and we got a
1:39:34
real cracker-jack guy, Steve Hart,
1:39:39
who is now, an associate professor at Northern Arizona University.
1:39:45
Quite successful.
1:39:46
He arrived somewhere around `87, maybe `88.
1:39:48
He arrived there
1:40:01
and he never had a meeting that I heard about with Dave, for a year.
1:40:05
So, the guy spent a whole year wondering what on earth he
1:40:09
was supposed to be doing here.
1:40:10
He went to meetings, but evidently, he and Dave just never got it together.
1:40:17
So, the project just sort of started off like that.
1:40:20
And then Steve decided, frankly, he was just going to do his own
1:40:23
thing, to finish out his post-doc, so it wouldn’t be a total failure.
1:40:30
He basically set up a bunch of studies and he’s published on those.
1:40:34
But in terms of setting up the project, nothing happened.
1:40:38
Those studies that he did, were they integrated into the group?
1:40:41
No, but they were related to the topic of long-term study productivity.
1:40:45
But it wasn’t the way I approached the log thing.
1:40:51
“Let’s get the hypothesis, what’s the study design, let’s get on with it
1:40:54
here.” It just never crystallized at all.
1:40:59
Then Dave was having second thoughts about cutting an old-growth stand just
1:41:09
to put in a young stand on the Andrews.
1:41:13
And a whole bunch of things started to crop up.
1:41:15
There were owl sites nearby.
1:41:17
Given the
1:41:19
fact that there was never any momentum, it was impossible to get any.
1:41:24
It was like we were just stuck in this goo.
1:41:28
And Dave wanted more and more money, and there was less and less to give out.
1:41:33
And the productivity was not excellent, I mean, it was pretty poor, actually.
1:41:42
And they weren’t going outside at that point.
1:41:46
In the log study, the strategy was get the basic thing set up, and get out
1:41:51
and get money from NSF to do the rest.
1:41:56
For site productivity, it was all done internally in LTER, so instead
1:41:59
of getting into writing proposals to get the basic thing funded, it
1:42:06
was always, go to LTER to get more.
1:42:08
Well, the problem was that we were not very good with accountability as a group.
1:42:15
We were actually awful, and
1:42:19
we’re all to blame there.
1:42:25
For something to have happened, Fred would have to have stepped
1:42:27
forward, been the real “bad guy” and just said, “No more money.
1:42:30
Period.” He didn’t want to do that.
1:42:34
He’s an optimist and felt it would turn around eventually.
1:42:39
But it never really did.
1:42:41
So then, Dave, I’ll never forget, one day declared that the project was over, after
1:42:47
maybe about $350,000 had been spent on it.
1:42:51
He hadn’t gotten one paper out on it.
1:42:54
There was just a little bit of field work, and everyone was dumbfounded.
1:42:58
It
1:43:01
looked totally dead.
1:43:02
Eventually, the Forest Service picked it up and moved it to the Isolation
1:43:06
Block [Willamette NF land south of Vida, Oregon] . They, frankly, did a
1:43:09
much better job with it than we did.
1:43:13
But it was a shame because when it started, it was a hot topic and you could
1:43:17
have gotten money from the National Forest Service or the National Forest or the
1:43:22
National Science Foundation, to do it.
1:43:25
But it all just withered away.
1:43:27
I
1:43:29
would count it as the biggest disappointment in
1:43:32
the whole LTER existence.
1:43:34
The Forest Service picked it up?
1:43:36
Who?
1:43:36
Bernard Bormann eventually came in and started to work with Carol and Dave.
1:43:46
And then eventually when Dave decided to just drop the whole thing.
1:43:52
He wasn’t gonna fight to have it done on the Andrews.
1:43:55
Then it actually became a Forest Service project, and they found
1:43:58
a place to do it off the Andrews.
1:44:00
Where was that?
1:44:01
The Isolation Block.
1:44:03
Where exactly is......
1:44:04
Well, let’s see.
1:44:09
I guess it’s like at Leaburg.
1:44:11
[West of Vida in McKenzie River Valley]
1:44:11
Okay.
1:44:15
It’s a separated part of the Willamette National Forest,
1:44:17
surrounded by private land.
1:44:19
It has mature timber.
1:44:23
Actually, at that point, Jim Boyle, who’s over in forest
1:44:28
resources [OSU] , took it on.
1:44:30
He was the LSU connection, and Bernard was the Forest Service connection
1:44:36
of scientists working on it.
1:44:39
They finally they got the thing started to be installed, at least.
1:44:43
But, probably about a decade behind the LTER plan.
1:44:49
Kind of a shame.
1:44:52
That’s a good case study though.
1:44:55
Yeah, there’s lots for everybody to feel bad about in that one.
1:45:03
You raised some interesting points here about your concern about the
1:45:10
about possibly moving away from the log study into the long-term productivity
1:45:14
study, and you were concerned about becoming a super-technician.
1:45:21
Yeah, because I knew I could do the logistics stuff.
1:45:25
I thought I’d done that, and I didn’t want to keep doing it.
1:45:30
I thought maybe you could talk a little bit about your concept here
1:45:34
of the science of the log study, versus the technical aspects of it.
1:45:40
Well,
1:45:44
there’s some involvement of science in setting up the study, because I
1:45:47
believe you have to have some pretty broad hypotheses that aren’t trivial.
1:45:53
I remember someone said, “This process is the sum of the interactions between biotic
1:46:00
and a-biotic factors.” And I thought, what the hell has been left out here?
1:46:05
This is like, everything is important to everything.
1:46:08
So, it’s really quite challenging to come up with something that isn’t
1:46:12
trite, but may stand the test of time,
1:46:17
and is flexible enough to do a lot of things in.
1:46:20
It’s really challenging.
1:46:22
That’s where the science of that goes on.
1:46:26
The technician part comes with those kinds of hypotheses and
1:46:31
the mechanisms to test them.
1:46:33
And, plan how you put this latest experiment out and get it out.
1:46:39
To do it right is a really time-consuming process.
1:46:45
For the long-term site productivity study, they never did that.
1:46:49
I can remember Art saying that they when went out to look at the site with
1:46:56
the Forest Service, they were thinking about how they would do the cutting and
1:47:00
asked, “Well, what are the treatments?” Dave had no treatments. He said, “Well,
1:47:04
wait a minute.” And he sketched out these treatments on his car hood.
1:47:09
That’s all he put into the thinking of the treatments.
1:47:11
It was incredible.
1:47:12
Whereas in the log study, we need these species and we need this many logs, and
1:47:17
we’re going to put this bunch in tents [insect exclosures] , and this bunch here.
1:47:21
We could tell them exactly.
1:47:23
To
1:47:26
do that right, it sounds trivial to the scientist,
1:47:32
but it’s really difficult.
1:47:34
It’s not a job you can half do.
1:47:38
It’s like half-baking a cake.
1:47:40
It doesn’t really work.
1:47:42
If you’re gonna bake the cake, bake the cake.
1:47:46
Don’t half bake it and put frosting on it.
1:47:49
A crummy analogy, but it’s like that.
1:47:52
And it takes an incredible amount of energy to do it seriously.
1:47:56
That’s
1:47:59
not where I wanted to go.
1:48:00
I knew I could do that, and I’ve done it since.
1:48:05
There was this LIDET experiment, this long-term, inter-site
1:48:07
decomposition experiment.
1:48:09
[Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment] I was chosen, I’m not sure
1:48:11
why, but someone called me up on behalf of the network and said, “Well, you’re on
1:48:16
this thing. We know you can do it because you have these skills.” But, that was a
1:48:24
few years after the log thing happened.
1:48:26
Plus,
1:48:31
I know a lot about the science and what needs to be done,
1:48:34
and studied on these logs.
1:48:35
I want some time to actually do that, pursue it.
1:48:39
Reap the rewards of all that effort.
1:48:43
This series of short studies that you talked about, you had a vision?
1:48:48
Yes, the various ones we should do.
1:48:53
Some of them didn’t work out, but a lot did.
1:48:55
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your priorities in terms of where
1:48:58
you saw that long-term study going
1:49:02
when you laid it out and for these short-term ones?
1:49:05
Well, some of the things were very simple, like, questions about the water balance.
1:49:14
There are so many areas in coarse wood where people didn’t really
1:49:18
look at the system, and they just sort of seat-of-their-pants said
1:49:22
something, which became “the fact.” And as we sent the proposal in, we
1:49:27
are often reminded of these facts.
1:49:29
We wanted to do a study that would actually show what was going on.
1:49:35
For example, in the water balance study we did a very simple study where we
1:49:39
watched the water that came through a canopy and rolled off the tops of
1:49:42
these logs and came out the bottom.
1:49:45
How much was in the log?
1:49:48
People had said, prior to that, that the logs had no
1:49:51
influence on the water balance.
1:49:54
Their idea was that the logs are always wet.
1:49:57
Therefore, they neither absorb water, nor release water.
1:50:01
They’re just inert.
1:50:03
When actually, they absorb water and they release water.
1:50:07
That is why they’re not static.
1:50:09
The system is dynamic, not static.
1:50:11
But everybody thought, “It lasts forever, it is static.
1:50:15
It’s just like a rock with bark on
1:50:20
it.” That seemed like a big priority.
1:50:22
We found it influences the water budget of an old-growth forest significantly.
1:50:30
One way we think about that is, there is the interception, how much water
1:50:33
gets taken out by the canopy or the litter layer before it enters the soil.
1:50:38
They had that term at zero for loss.
1:50:40
We found out it was 2-6 percent.
1:50:45
Now, that’s a small part of a hundred, but you have to realize
1:50:47
the canopy takes out 10-15 percent.
1:50:50
So, 6 percent is a lot to miss.
1:50:54
It
1:50:56
was like that on many things.
1:51:00
Every time we looked at nutrients, the logs, we thought, acted like big sponges.
1:51:05
But we found out, actually, they were releasing nutrients every year.
1:51:09
They weren’t absorbing nutrients like everyone said.
1:51:13
They were releasing them.
1:51:16
That leads to the questions about the mechanisms.
1:51:21
How does that work?
1:51:27
Then there were basic things like food-webs.
1:51:30
Who breaks down the wood?
1:51:33
Which insects are involved?
1:51:34
Which fungi?
1:51:35
The insect part kind of worked out, but the fungal part was too difficult.
1:51:43
We couldn’t do it then.
1:51:44
Maybe we could do it now.
1:51:47
Was there a knowledge base?
1:51:48
Well, we didn’t have good isolation methods, and we didn’t
1:51:52
have good identification methods.
1:51:54
All we ended up with was, “There’s a pile of brown fuzz, and white fuzz, and
1:51:59
darker brown fuzz, and black fuzz.” Out of 7,000 isolates, they got a thousand down
1:52:05
to a genus.
1:52:07
And a lot of those are penicillim, everyone knows what penicillin looks like.
1:52:12
I could ID that.
1:52:13
It’s just green; green-blue.
1:52:16
Over half of those were penicillium.
1:52:20
We basically didn’t know what on earth those things were.
1:52:25
So, we started looking at it a different way and got some good results.
1:52:32
The trouble is, there’s a lot of small fungi that don’t have big mushrooms.
1:52:36
We still don’t know what they are.
1:52:40
But now there are some methodologies and techniques that will help you do that.
1:52:50
Looking for genetic tags and stuff, for example.
1:52:54
People are just starting to do that.
1:52:57
When you got into these various studies, like water balance and nutrient
1:53:01
studies, how do you characterize the significance of the interactions you
1:53:07
had with people at the Andrews’ site or here at OSU in developing those fronts?
1:53:13
Well,
1:53:16
it was a rocky road at first.
1:53:19
I was one of the first PIs to kind of take over when this process came in.
1:53:27
I was still a graduate student.
1:53:29
Tim Schowalter
1:53:32
was chosen to do all this process as a Ph.D. scientist.
1:53:38
In one
1:53:41
of the proposals, my name wasn’t even on it, and I was really bummed.
1:53:44
I had just spent a year-and-a-half putting this study together, and it looked
1:53:50
like I was not going to be involved.
1:53:53
That was kind of a bummer.
1:53:55
Then I got involved, and then, I got very frustrated with Tim’s leadership because
1:54:01
he didn’t really understand the system.
1:54:05
He’s got great insight into insects and canopy work, but the
1:54:09
log work I don't think he really has that, and I wasn’t alone.
1:54:15
A lot of people didn’t think he had the insight.
1:54:17
He actually came up with this biotic/abiotic hypothesis, which left
1:54:23
a lot of us wondering, “Oh my God. This is a problem.” Because of that,
1:54:29
NSF will not fund a study like this.
1:54:34
And then he had a whole two-page list of hypotheses, which were like, “Temperature
1:54:39
does not have an effect on decay.
1:54:42
Water does not.” It was a whole bunch of null hypotheses which weren’t well-thought
1:54:46
out, and I wanted to have them very well-integrated and very-focused.
1:54:54
So, he and I started butting heads immediately.
1:54:59
And we just did not get along.
1:55:02
Eventually, the group that was involved, most of them were
1:55:09
not LTER scientists by the way,
1:55:13
but most of them were scientists, just lost confidence in him and
1:55:18
wouldn’t follow his leadership.
1:55:20
They just didn’t want to be on a proposal with him.
1:55:24
In the meantime, they learned more about what I was thinking.
1:55:30
They didn’t agree with everything I’d said, but they had a lot more faith
1:55:33
that I could kind of go through all this and put it together as they intended.
1:55:39
So, that’s how it evolved, that I would take over all that process stuff.
1:55:45
By then, I had my Ph.D. and had gotten the degree.
1:55:50
I
1:55:52
was trying to be a team player, but Tim was just not prioritizing things.
1:55:58
He was taking money out of the project and spending it on other
1:56:01
places that were not paying off.
1:56:06
It was a pretty tense time for him and me.
1:56:11
We now talk to each other, but I think there’s some reservations
1:56:15
still there, on a personal level.
1:56:28
We tried to get a big group.
1:56:29
We got an entomologist, Jack Lattin, involved, Andy Moldenke, and Tim.
1:56:38
Then we had people working on fungi, and that was initially, Jim Trappe
1:56:42
and a fella named Steve Carpenter.
1:56:47
Jim was not that interested in it.
1:56:50
He kind of dropped out.
1:56:52
I think he was mostly helping Steve get established, so,
1:56:56
Steve eventually took over.
1:56:59
Who else?
1:57:00
Myself,
1:57:03
and that was about it.
1:57:04
I think others came on board later.
1:57:08
Actually, we had Rick Kelsey.
1:57:10
He was hired on as a post-doc, and he’s at the Forest Service now.
1:57:15
Rick was working on attractants for the insects.
1:57:20
Steve Carpenter was working on identifying the fungi carried
1:57:24
by the insects, and also,
1:57:29
that got into the logs.
1:57:31
So, it was kind of interesting to see if they were different.
1:57:35
I was doing most of the ecosystem type measurements;
1:57:39
decay-rates, nutrient-changes,
1:57:44
water-balance, leeching, respiration.
1:57:48
I was doing all that stuff.
1:57:50
I was actually doing about 80 percent of the work and not getting paid very much.
1:57:59
Eventually, it involved Elaine Ingham, who’s in botany [OSU]
1:58:03
and she came with a background in
1:58:09
non-arthropod invertebrates, things like nematodes and bacteria and protozoa.
1:58:18
From that point it was very population and biodiversity-driven.
1:58:28
I think those were really good ideas.
1:58:31
We were kind of covering all our bases, but the NSF reviews
1:58:35
coming back were not very good.
1:58:38
First of all, in ecosystems, there wasn’t a lot of support for
1:58:43
knowing what the organism was.
1:58:46
I think it’s wrong, but there just wasn’t.
1:58:47
So, they weren’t going to pay that money.
1:58:53
We were not that focused.
1:58:55
We were trying to do it all.
1:58:57
Actually, we had one proposal that was like
1:59:03
$4 million for five years.
1:59:05
Or maybe it was two; I guess it was 2 1/2.
1:59:10
But at that time, that was astronomical.
1:59:11
That was an LTER study.
1:59:14
We didn’t have the common sense to realize what we were asking for.
1:59:18
[Chuckle] It’s funny in retrospect, but we were just all learning, and
1:59:23
I was learning in particular, what we needed to do to get it funded.
1:59:28
So, it was turning out well.
1:59:33
Tim ran it for the first couple of years, and then, we put in our
1:59:36
proposal and it didn’t get funded, and he was going to give up.
1:59:40
I called Jerry Melillo at NSF and said, at least give us the
1:59:45
money to shut this thing down.
1:59:49
Don’t just turn us off.
1:59:50
We got all these fuzzy things we want to save.
