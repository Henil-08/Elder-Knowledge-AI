00:26
I guess I convinced him.
00:28
Tim was a little bit upset because I kind of went behind his back.
00:33
I told him I was going to do it.
00:34
Actually, I told him I thought he should do it, but he just wasn’t.
00:36
He was pretty dispirited at that point.
00:39
He put a lot of work into it.
00:41
I just don’t think it was going much where he wanted to push it.
00:45
So, we got money to shut it down and brought up another year.
00:50
At that point people said, “You’re the PI on this project.
00:55
We’re not going to follow Tim
00:58
anymore.” Actually, what happened for that money was, I wrote the proposal
01:03
and Tim put his name on it first.
01:05
People got Tim’s draft, they just laughed and said, “We’re not going
01:10
to send this in, Tim.” Tim went and revised it, but people came to me
01:16
and said, “You write the proposal.
01:18
You seem to know what’s going on.
01:21
These are the ideas, we’ll work with you.” And then we gave
01:23
it to Tim as he was the PI.
01:27
At that point, it was pretty clear people were not going to follow Tim any longer.
01:31
They just
01:35
were not.
01:35
Eventually, we kind of worked it down to a nice hypothesis that was doable, which
01:42
involved what happened to the carbon.
01:47
We broke it down and
01:50
in what we call a brown rot system or a white rot system.
01:54
Just to explain that a little bit, a white rot degrades about everything,
01:58
and a brown rot doesn’t degrade lignin.
02:00
If you have a brown rot system, it accumulates a lot of this
02:04
brown mush on the ground, and in a white rot, it doesn’t.
02:08
It had a lot of impacts on nutrient cycling and carbon stores.
02:13
We sold it on that basis.
02:14
At that point, most everybody had dropped out.
02:18
They were discouraged, maybe because it was clear NSF was not going to
02:25
support a biodiversity emphasis.
02:26
They’re not gonna do it.
02:26
Since then, we went in for a
02:34
renewal, and NSF was very reluctant to fund it.
02:39
I must say, I’ve been very disappointed in their level of support.
02:46
Sometimes it got bad reviews, but even when it got good reviews, the program
02:50
director never put it in a priority slot.
02:53
I’ve temporarily given up on them as a source of funding for us.
02:57
They don’t seem to think it’s worthy.
03:01
I’ve presented lots of talks on it for NSF and LTER.
03:05
They’re always well-received, but it never translates into funding.
03:10
It’s a mystery to me.
03:12
Sounds like you had a connection with the program director?
03:17
Well, I knew who he was, what he did.
03:22
Normally, I never call the program director.
03:24
I’m a person who will develop my ideas independent of the program director.
03:30
I’d realized in the log research, I had to stick with real sound,
03:34
basic science and not go for fads.
03:39
I could not keep up with fads, and I couldn’t apply them to the log research.
03:42
If I was gonna do that, I had to convince people there was a lot to
03:46
be learned, and it was good science.
03:52
I found that I never got anything out of the program directors.
03:56
It was impossible.
03:59
My habit has always been to kind of not do that much, and this was a rare exception.
04:06
I just felt desperate that we needed to not throw things out.
04:11
Now, this happened to George Carroll on his tree [canopy] research.
04:14
He had an NSF project going, they were doing some real exciting work,
04:18
and then they had, I guess, a so-so proposal that could have been improved.
04:24
But NSF basically said, “Don’t send this in again.
04:27
We’re just cutting you off.” And a lot of that data has
04:33
never been examined to this day.
04:35
They just turned it right off.
04:37
I kind of reminded them of that disaster, because they were finding
04:42
out lots of neat things in the canopy.
04:45
Which is starting to be learned over again at Wind River [Experimental Forest
04:48
in southern Washington, where they had a canopy crane for years at that point]
04:50
. There was a recognition that NSF said that there had been a mistake?
04:53
They had made a mistake in doing that.
04:57
But, they threw their investment away is what they did.
05:03
So, I made that argument, plus pleaded.
05:07
I think I was pretty convincing.
05:09
I was really concerned, I think that’s how that came across.
05:13
They found the money to just shut it
05:17
down.
05:17
Maybe you could talk
05:28
a little bit about your perception of the advantages and disadvantages
05:33
of doing long-term research with grant-supported programs?
05:36
It’s
05:44
not necessarily a study, but the advantage of a site where you can keep making these
05:47
investments, it really does start to
05:52
add up.
05:54
And
06:01
it may not be that synergistic in the sense that you get a lot
06:05
more out of it than the parts.
06:07
At least all the parts are there to build from, and assumptions
06:14
about things can be much stronger.
06:15
So, there’s that.
06:17
But also, I like to think
06:21
of the synthesis before, after the fact.
06:24
In other words, usually we take a whole bunch of facts and information, and we
06:29
know we get a convincing story out of it, but a lot of times it’s very qualitative.
06:36
Whereas, when you have a synthesis before, you actually think of what
06:42
the connections should be and go out and investigate them, you often can
06:49
get more than a qualitative analysis.
06:52
You can make a real quantitative analysis, and sometimes that can tell you things.
07:01
Here’s an example:
07:04
invertebrates are important in the decomposition of litter.
07:10
There’s no doubt about that.
07:11
But, if you look at sites in the whole LTER network,
07:16
you’ll find there are some sites, like in the Arctic, they don’t make a difference.
07:22
They’re not that big a deal.
07:25
In the desert where there’s termites, they’re a big deal.
07:29
They really control how litter disappears.
07:34
So, in one place, they’re eating a little bit, and in another
07:37
place, they’re eating most of it.
07:39
You don’t see that kind of stuff, a lot of times in after-the-fact synthesis.
07:44
You don’t see that kind of stuff.
07:48
Now, that example is what we did in LIDET, which is more a spatial
07:54
dimension than a temporal dimension.
07:57
They’re somewhat related.
08:01
I think, the thing of being able over time to make these investments in a
08:06
system, we’ll set this up and we’ll observe it, and periodically make
08:10
experiments, you learn a lot more.
08:13
And it just holds together as a story, without any artifice there.
08:19
That’s the story, versus making a likely story that sounds good, consistent with
08:27
the facts, but God knows if it works.
08:31
I’ll give you an example of that.
08:35
A classic way to get at
08:42
longtime dimensions is to substitute space for time.
08:46
In other words, you go out and find old fields that are different ages,
08:52
or forests that came from them, or in this case, find logs that are different
08:57
ages in the same site, same time.
09:01
They did that work on the Andrews, and they found decay rates.
09:04
The big story was that Douglas-fir decays at half the rate of hemlock.
09:14
People took that data and said, “Douglas-fir decays very slowly compared
09:20
to Coweeta because it’s really cold and wet out there. Coweeta is warm and
09:28
wet.” It’s really temperature then, isn’t it? Yeah, it’s just colder at
09:34
Andrews.
09:35
The problem with that, and it sounded logical, but when we actually started
09:38
putting it into an experiment, and we’d gotten the results, we found
09:42
a given size hemlock decays at about the same rate as Douglas-fir,
09:47
at least the first decade or so.
09:49
Same rate.
09:51
Why did they get that early result?
09:54
Because they were measuring Doug-fir this big, like a meter across, and
09:59
hemlocks, 30 centimeters across.
10:02
What we found was, there’s a tremendous effect of size.
10:07
And Doug-fir does decay slightly slower than hemlock, don’t get me wrong.
10:13
But the major effect they were recording, was one of size.
10:18
And that was the classic result, still out in the literature there.
10:23
When I first came on board, that was one of the classic stories.
10:27
Wow, these species are really different.
10:32
So that was just an example of where this chronosequence approach can be misleading.
10:35
When you put together what sounds like a good story, but then when
10:38
you test it with an experiment over time, it isn’t necessarily true.
10:49
Part of the study you were working on, to put together a long-term study like
10:56
that, sounds like what you’re saying is you need to have a very clear idea up
11:01
front, so you have good testing points.
11:04
This is what we’ve done so far, and this is what we’re looking for next.
11:06
Yes.
11:07
That’s right.
11:07
So that grant structure kind of encourages that kind of thought process.
11:12
Yeah, I think so.
11:13
It isn’t a fishing expedition.
11:15
And that’s part of the problem we had early on, we were on a fishing expedition.
11:23
We covered things from the nutrient-cycling, to the insects,
11:27
to the plants that grow on the logs, to all these things.
11:32
There hadn’t been anything done, so we were going to do it all.
11:35
We were going to be the wood decay center of the world.
11:38
Which we kind of are now, de facto.
11:41
But nobody else is interested in creating such a center.
11:46
And we had to kind of learn that fact slowly.
11:50
We were pretty stubborn.
11:53
I was going to say, flexibility sounds like an asset, and what
11:56
you’re saying is the reverse?
11:58
Well, no, there is some flexibility.
12:02
But I think that you need that to keep a really solid thing to build on.
12:10
It can’t be, as Fred Cox thought, the inverse of
12:17
Sir Hillary’s comment, “Why did you climb it?
12:20
Because it’s there.” Scientists use the inverse, “Why did you study it? Because
12:24
nothing’s there.” And that didn’t sell real well. It’s just not competitive.
12:31
Plus, it’s sloppy thinking.
12:32
If
12:36
you think hard enough about it, you’ll come up with some
12:39
things that are pretty profound.
12:43
For example, that basic model we had of why size and species were different
12:49
that I came up with back in ‘83, is now the basis of a simulation model that
12:53
we’re building that’s gonna be applied all over the world, because, basically,
12:57
we found the underlying controls.
13:01
Now, the rates of those things are all different everywhere.
13:04
But, it applies.
13:07
It’s a very general kind of model we had and were investigating.
13:12
Now we know that it basically works, we can run with it.
13:18
What about some disadvantages, some problems, with that structure?
13:21
Do you see any?
13:22
Well, you’re talking about inflexibility, but I think right now, I have
13:29
probably a lot of long-term studies.
13:33
Maybe more than average, if I listed them: there’s the log study, we have a
13:38
branch study, we have a long-term root decay study that I have with a graduate
13:43
student that’s a decade-long study.
13:47
I have another, sort of a global-level branch decay study and log study,
13:51
that’s like a ten-year duration.
13:54
I followed these elk exclosures for 15 years.
14:00
And I’ve worked with Steve Acker and Sarah Greene and Art McKee on
14:06
long-term vegetation measurements.
14:09
All these long-term studies, I love them.
14:11
But it’s to the point where I can’t do any short-term studies anymore.
14:15
It’s hard for me to do.
14:16
I don’t have the time.
14:17
The commitment is overwhelming.
14:19
Now I admit, I’ve gone overboard.
14:22
And what I’m trying to do as I move through is try and turn those things
14:28
over to graduate students or other people, so I can get some flexibility.
14:38
What are your priorities for teaching or communicating the results of your work?
14:44
You talk quite a bit about graduate students, and my understanding was
14:47
that for quite a while here you were on a courtesy appointment here at OSU,
14:53
but you integrate a lot of the work you’ve done with the graduate program.
14:57
Yeah, several things went on.
14:59
For years, I had money allocated for graduate students, and the budgets
15:05
would be cut by about that amount.
15:07
I don’t know if it was deliberate, but it was impossible for me to get graduate
15:14
students.
15:15
So, the first priority actually was to get technician support.
15:19
Jay Sexton was a technician who’s worked on the log study for probably to seven
15:28
to eight years, something like that.
15:31
So, my priority was to get funding for him.
15:35
Then, with that being secured, I had some success, and then, I
15:40
started looking into students.
15:42
The first student I had was Chen Hua, who’s from China, and I got involved
15:47
with him on an exchange, an LTER-related exchange, sponsored by the Man and
15:54
Biosphere program, but on wood decay.
15:57
He was doing a project like that, I helped advise him, then he came
16:01
to the US and got some training, he went back to China, and came back.
16:05
He was the first one.
16:06
I knew Chen real well, and we were very interested in doing some kind of project.
16:13
So, we got into this root decay thing.
16:16
Then, I got funding for another student on a grant.
16:22
I was amazed.
16:24
Finally, I had funding for two students.
16:29
Then I started to realize that for me to advance, I need to have
16:35
students and involve students more with the research I’m doing.
16:38
I’m just doing too many things.
16:41
There was a lot of stuff I was missing by just having technicians.
16:45
The education element wasn’t really there that much.
16:50
One of the problems I had early on when I was promoted to assistant professor,
16:55
was they failed to tell me at OSU I had to apply to be on the graduate
17:02
faculty.
17:02
These are six-year academic appointments, so I had a three-year,
17:05
mid-term review, and they asked me why I didn’t have any students.
17:08
I didn’t know, because I was amazed no students had shown up.
17:12
Well, I wasn’t on their list, so no one knew I was available.
17:16
Right after that, I started to get a lot of students, and I’d
17:19
be on committees as grad rep or
17:25
substituting for people who had dropped off.
17:27
I got involved in a whole bunch of committees and started realizing I needed
17:32
to get more involved with the students.
17:35
That they were bringing in a dimension that technicians didn’t bring.
17:41
How would you characterize that?
17:42
The technicians are professionals, and they’re paid to know the answers.
17:46
I think up the absurd things we have to do, and sometimes
17:51
we think them up together.
17:52
But they really translate them into doable projects.
17:57
I help them.
18:00
I’ve always believed I should be out there helping, especially on
18:03
big projects, in setting them up.
18:05
So a lot of times I’ll work with them as an extra hand.
18:10
Nonetheless, they sort of bring that professional dimension and experience,
18:14
as they usually have a lot of experience.
18:17
The graduate students don’t bring much experience, but they bring
18:21
a lot of energy, and they bring a focus to specific questions that
18:26
neither I or the technicians do.
18:28
We’re stretched thin maintaining things.
18:32
But, we’re maintaining lots of things.
18:35
And the students can bring a focus that neither I nor the technicians can bring.
18:46
I try to integrate, and I do integrate the technicians in with the students.
18:49
They’re introduced.
18:50
The technicians provide guidance, and sometimes manpower, and extra hands, but
19:00
they’re not a substitute for the graduate students.
19:03
I mean, the graduate students have to take command of their project.
19:07
So initially, with Chen Hua, we probably did a little bit more than we should have.
19:14
When we saw him floundering, we just stepped in and did things.
19:16
But we’re kind of working out a system now, where we can let
19:20
students twist in the wind just long enough to learn something.
19:25
If it’s really going south, we’ll come in and save the day.
19:30
But we try and let them go as far as they can.
19:36
The shift to using graduate students sounds like it’s fairly recent?
19:40
It is.
19:48
I wasn’t a player at all in the beginning and I became pretty
19:52
key in setting up an experiment.
19:54
Then
19:57
I sort of played a key advisor role, and it increased through time.
20:02
At the end of LTER 3, Fred was relying on me a lot for advice,
20:10
sort of as a sounding board.
20:12
There were other people helping too, though.
20:14
I’m not the only one.
20:16
I was becoming more important in that way.
20:18
Actually, as we wrote LTER 4, I played a major role in taking lessons
20:25
of LTER 3 and applying them to that proposal and how it was structured.
20:31
Fred had been at the helm for a long time.
20:34
So, the plan would be eventually, that I would be the LTER main PI,
20:45
conditioned on several things.
20:47
But I realized that I really need more technician support and a good set of
20:53
students to carry out my work, because I would soon not be able to do it.
21:00
It’s like I don't know how I’m gonna do, but I do know this.
21:05
It’s like the distance between setting up a study, the technical
21:10
part, and the science part.
21:14
If you’re gonna do the technical sett-up, you have to do 100 percent,
21:18
or 99 percent, something like that.
21:20
A large proportion.
21:22
It’s not a trivial exercise.
21:23
If you’re gonna be the scientist,
21:28
you’ve gotta do that.
21:29
And if you’re going to be trying to integrate these people, you
21:31
can’t be trying to do your science.
21:35
You can do some of it, but really, it’s a full-time job.
21:41
You can’t kind of half do that job.
21:44
If you’re gonna do it, you have to do the job.
21:46
Do you see yourself now moving more towards -- ? [LTER context/HJA-PI work]
21:50
Well, I’m hoping to be sort of
21:55
a cheerleader and a supporter, like Fred has been.
21:59
You know, Fred really did get a lot of money in LTER during his tenure
22:03
to do his stuff on disturbance.
22:08
He got a lot of that through the Forest Service.
22:10
But he put an incredible amount into guiding research and giving
22:14
direction and focus, and getting the group to try and come into consensus.
22:19
That takes a lot of work.
22:20
Both figuring out what the consensus might be, so he could lead, but also, pushing
22:26
the group when they need to be pushed.
22:31
The main hang-up now is I’m still all soft money, and I can’t
22:35
do that job in this position.
22:38
I have to have support, because I’ll have to drop the thing that
22:42
keeps me going on soft money.
22:46
I can’t be a mediocre scientist and a stellar leader.
22:51
The science funding will dry up.
22:53
That won’t work.
22:57
So more and more, I’ve realized that this transition is coming.
23:00
Also, as I got promoted from assistant to associate professor, I realized that
23:07
the things I need to do are different.
23:09
The expectations are different.
23:13
It’s not just enough to be a slam bang scientist doing lots of research.
23:18
You’re expected to do more, provide more leadership.
23:22
And you’ve become more student-focused, too?
23:24
More student-focused, the time for having an actual course.
23:28
I taught small courses and honors courses for students, but a real course.
23:35
A real curriculum, a contribution, but can’t do it on soft money.
23:42
So, there’s lots of things I cannot do.
23:45
My peers expect me to be able to go on review proposals.
23:52
I’ve done some of that.
23:53
But I can’t afford six weeks to do that.
23:57
No.
23:57
Your list is long-term projects.
24:00
It’s pretty mind-boggling to think of the time commitment involved there.
24:04
There’s a lot.
24:05
In fact, I’ve paid a price for that.
24:07
I’ve
24:10
had problems mentally trying to hang on, and find a different way to do it.
24:18
I’ve sorta come from the mold of you just push harder, you just keep pushing harder.
24:21
Well, I found out you can only get so far, and then you need
24:26
to think about another way.
24:28
It doesn’t serve you forever as a way of doing it.
24:34
So,
24:44
your concept is to mentor people like Chen Hua along to pick up some of this
24:50
science work to give time for more?
24:53
Yeah.
24:54
And I had one post-doc, too.
24:58
I have a whole bunch of studies going in Russia, but that’s not all my work.
25:03
I’m doing other projects too.
25:04
Yeah.
25:05
Sure.
25:07
The idea is to find people to pick
25:12
up
25:15
the work at the post-doc level, eventually.
25:15
So, maybe Chen Hua or someone else will do that for the decay studies.
25:19
I’ve already got someone working on stuff we do in Russia, who kind is in charge
25:26
of those now and he runs those studies.
25:35
You were talking earlier about applied research and basic plans for your work.
25:40
Could you talk just a little bit about who you consider your most important
25:45
audience, or audiences, and how important it is for scientists to convey knowledge?
25:53
Well, there’s a whole bunch there.
25:56
I think our primary audience is scientists.
26:01
We should be preparing for peer-reviewed, very-high quality science that will
26:09
have an impact on how we think about the world, basically is the message there.
26:17
I think, ultimately, that does trickle out in how
26:24
the educated public is concerned about and thinks about the world.
26:28
You can look at the issues that are brought out now about preservation of
26:32
old growth, and really a lot of those issues had their origins in the IBP days.
26:38
Discoveries about what’s going on an actual old-growth forest.
26:43
That’s kind of a slow process, but it’s not the only kind of communication
26:49
that’s important with the peers.
26:52
I’m a very strong believer in what we call gray literature.
26:57
There are some things that we owe in terms of documenting our
27:02
science and methodologies and databases that we have to do.
27:08
It’s not just getting the cream of the cream, but we’ve gotta have
27:13
some milk in that pitcher, too.
27:16
I think the role in terms of the public is important, although I
27:22
haven’t spent a lot of time on that.
27:26
We mostly do it through news contacts, so they can help us translate.
27:32
It’s sort of depending on when issues are hot or not.
27:35
Right now, there’s a lot of stuff on carbon sequestration and greenhouse
27:39
gases for the upcoming summit.
27:43
I’m getting called a lot about that recently.
27:45
Do you have journalists who kind of keep in regular contact with you?
27:50
No.
27:52
It’s been a different crop each time.
27:57
On that front, glad to provide information.
28:00
We’ve had a couple press releases.
28:05
Frankly, we’ve not had good luck through OSU getting our message out.
28:09
Hasn’t been good luck.
28:11
We’ve done better on our own with reporters.
28:17
Fred has good contacts and there are some people, but largely, we
28:23
have to touch bases every time on issues we cycled, in the five years
28:28
or whatever it takes to recycle.
28:29
I’ve done
28:34
things with school kids, I don’t know if I have this year.
28:39
I did
28:43
a thing called the Magic Schoolbus.
28:45
I didn’t do it, but I was a consultant on
28:50
it.
28:50
Basically, it tells kids about decay, which is funny.
28:53
It actually tells some things about wildlife management, wood, and ecosystems.
28:58
That was incorporated into the program?
29:01
They knew about me, asked if I’d help, and I said yes.
29:04
So there’s a series called the Magic Schoolbus on PBS.
29:09
And then, there’s one on the Rod Squad.
29:12
That’s the one I helped on.
29:16
And
29:22
they had a book from that too.
29:27
Actually, that was developed from the video series.
29:30
I wasn’t directly involved in the book, but a lot of ideas and guidance
29:35
were there in the book nonetheless.
29:38
Who were they?
29:39
Scholastic puts it out.
29:45
Okay.
29:45
I’ll bring one in for you to see.
29:46
It’s pretty funny.
29:50
There have been other cases that haven’t worked.
29:52
There was this thing called Microcosmos or something, which got in touch with
29:58
me but never really went anywhere.
30:02
Some
30:05
of that’s for specific kids.
30:12
And National Geographic, we’ll be asked to provide photos, or mostly captions
30:18
to photos, actually they get their own photos, better than we can take.
30:24
I’ve done that for the canopy crane and there was a description of
30:28
old-growth forests in the Northwest, and a drawing of a log and I had to
30:32
check out whether they had it right.
30:37
Well, for example, in the Magic Schoolbus, they had mosses growing
30:41
inside a log with no light.
30:42
I had to point out that these were photosynthetic plants
30:45
so they needed some photons.
30:49
They said, “Oh, we thought it’d look nice with moss artistically,
30:55
but…..” So, I think it’s real important, but I
31:02
had to balance it with my needs of survival in the soft money
31:09
arena. So, I can’t do all of that.
31:11
But, when it’s not gonna be a huge involvement, sure I get involved.
31:15
Do you think the Andrews group is typical or atypical in
31:19
doing those kinds of things?
31:20
Well, I don’t know.
31:21
I have a sense we’re atypical, but I could be wrong.
31:29
Let’s say I haven’t done a lot of surveying on my own.
31:32
I think the LTERs are pretty involved in that kind of thing in general.
31:38
I know the Palmer Station had an interactive web-page, live
31:48
feed from Antarctic, where you could ask Francis questions.
31:50
I think we might do some of that in the future, things that don’t cost
31:54
us a lot in time, but would get us interaction with the public more,
31:59
also in terms of policy sometimes.
32:02
I just wrote a letter to
32:08
a Congressional committee on resources about a proposed thing,
32:14
on carbon stores and advising them, in fact, there were some real
32:20
problems with what they had there.
32:24
They had to really think about what was going
32:28
on here.
32:29
I’ve also done it by publishing articles.
32:32
The best story I’d give you is the Forest Service is supposed to clear
32:36
up old growth to store more carbon.
32:39
The idea being, to take up carbon from the atmosphere that the old forests
32:43
weren’t growing and the new forests were.
32:45
So logically, get rid of those non-growing forests and get growing forests.
32:51
But, we knew from our research that there were some problems with that perspective.
32:56
In fact, major problems, as replacing old forest with young forest was going
33:00
to release carbon into the atmosphere.
33:02
So, Jerry Franklin and I and Bill Ferrell wrote a little article to Science.
33:07
We had a press release come out with it.
33:10
Within days two things happened: the Forest Service disavowed any knowledge
33:15
of this proposed program, and they were searching for ways to get me fired.
33:22
But I didn’t work for
33:26
them.
33:26
And senators, I think Barbara Mikulski [cited in footnotes in the publication,
33:29
they were Senators R.H. Murkowski and T. Stevens, R-AK] , was one of
33:30
them who had made lots of statements about this, suddenly said, “Oh, I
33:34
never said that. No, no, no.” So that really short-circuited that whole
33:39
program, just by publishing the paper.
33:42
We did advise them earlier and that was a mistake, and they were not listening.
33:48
So, by putting it out in Science and having all these papers cover, it got
33:53
covered in Arabia, and everywhere.
33:55
People were sending me clippings from all over the world.
33:58
Do you have a copy of that?
34:01
1990. Yeah, I can give you a copy of the paper.
34:04
Yeah, I’d like to get a copy of that.
34:07
It’s interesting.
34:07
I think it got published in Japan.
34:13
I think the people who proposed this were really embarrassed
34:18
that they hadn’t listened.
34:19
Huh.
34:20
Unfortunately, with the high leadership in the Forest Service,
34:23
that has been true a lot.
34:26
Maybe until recently.
34:29
That reminds me a lot of the reaction to a lot of the work.
34:44
He probably told people who were managing that this is a
34:49
concern, and they just lit up.
34:51
That’s what we got.
35:10
Do your kids ever go up to your site?
35:14
I have one child, and yeah, he went up.
35:16
He knows all about it.
35:17
He’s always giving me grief, “Oh Dad, you’re just some deadwood nut.” We joke
35:22
about it. He’s helped me set up research.
35:26
When we first started, we were surveying these logs.
35:29
He’s getting a little better, but we were surveying where the logs were
35:32
and were putting these posts in.
35:36
He’d go around as a toddler, he’d yank the posts out and he’d throw them.
35:38
They were brightly colored.
35:40
You’d have someone tapping at your leg and he’d have the post that you’d
35:44
just spent an hour surveying in.
35:46
[Chuckle].
35:47
But now,
35:50
he helps out.
35:51
We went on a trip to do a study in Wyoming and he helped me with that.
35:56
The other day we were
36:00
doing studies on termites, because they release methane.
36:03
So, this tree was getting eaten by termites, so let’s see what they do.
36:09
How much do they “fart” out in methane?
36:11
That interested him.
36:13
He chopped it up and brought them into the lab and measured it.
36:17
How old is he again?
36:18
He’s ten.
36:18
Okay.
36:20
So, I’ll probably be getting more involved in the school because he’s
36:24
getting old enough that the kids’ science actually means something
36:27
to him, and he’s interested by it.
36:30
That’s Russell?
36:31
Yeah, Russell.
36:33
So,
36:37
especially if I wasn’t going back to this hunting for salary all the time,
36:44
I’d probably do more of that, actually.
36:46
Maybe we’d set some things up on the web for students.
36:51
That’d be kind of fun I think.
36:53
Interesting fun facts about forests.
36:57
You’d need to get funding from somewhere besides NSF
37:01
to do that?
37:01
Maybe, maybe not.
37:02
Or, we’d just do it.
37:04
The funny thing about the web is, in relative terms, it’s pretty cheap.
37:09
You
37:11
don’t have to print anything, and not only that, but in terms of reviewing and stuff.
37:14
It’s not quite as rigorous.
37:16
There’s not the time commitment.
37:18
Doesn’t have to be as polished.
37:20
In fact, you know, kind of outlining stuff is easier to access than sheets of print.
37:29
So, there’s something that you can do that isn’t that expensive.
37:33
I don’t know.
37:35
We’ll have to think about it.
37:36
We wouldn’t turn down money.
37:38
But, I wouldn’t want that hanging us up, because I figure that’s
37:44
a pretty important connection.
37:45
I am curious if Russell had an impact on your decision to do the Magic Schoolbus?
37:46
Oh sure.
37:52
I knew that would be a gas for him.
37:57
I probably would have done it anyway because it was pretty fun.
38:00
But, actually what happened was, I read those kinds of books to him,
38:05
the originals that were excellent.
38:07
There was the trip to the water works, and to the center of the earth,
38:10
and to the ocean, just excellent.
38:12
I think this series, the new one is not quite as good.
38:15
But I knew how good they were and how much they influenced
38:18
his thinking about science.
38:22
It wasn’t so much Russell, per se, but he exposed me to that aspect.
38:27
And I kind of could see how he reacted.
38:30
So, I knew it was a good investment.
38:32
Well,
38:37
I think we’ll call it quits.
