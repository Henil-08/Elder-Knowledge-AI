00:00
[first part of opening sentence, unintelligible; spoken as
00:05
tape recorder being set up]
00:15
-- their
00:18
eyes were getting big as
00:23
I was climbing over these logs.
00:27
I
00:30
was glad that Fred was there for some of them, because he has longer
00:33
legs and can take bigger steps.
00:36
[Chuckle]
00:36
I
00:39
should get going here.
00:42
I’ve fought with it a lot.
00:44
I had a friend that came up from Texas to visit this summer, and had this
00:47
little baby boy about a year-and-a-half old, went hiking with him up on Marys
00:52
Peak, and he was pretty good until I started going down pretty steep inclines.
00:57
His mom was behind, but he didn’t see her.
01:01
He got to the bottom, I turned around, and she looked at him, and
01:04
he looked at us with these saucer eyes, kind of like he was in shock.
01:07
Was he in a backpack?
01:09
Yeah.
01:10
One of those, traveler…..what do you call them?
01:13
Those are pretty good and secure.
01:17
He was just a little bit nervous about that.
01:21
I just turned the tape on.
01:25
Why don’t we get started here?
01:27
Like I said on the phone.
01:28
If you could talk a little bit about the background of how you came to be
01:31
involved at Oregon State University.
01:33
I believe you started here in ‘91 or ‘2?
01:35
’91, actually.
01:35
‘91, okay.
01:37
Maybe
01:40
you could talk about your personal background up until that time.
01:44
What are your origins, got you to the Northwest, your interest in the kind
01:46
of research that you’re working at, and
01:52
Oregon State University in particular?
01:58
Jones: My educational background includes a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics,
02:05
a Master’s Degree in International Relations, and the Ph.D. in Geography
02:11
and Environmental Engineering.
02:16
One factor I think that contributed to my eventually getting here, was
02:21
when I was in graduate school, I shared an office with Gordon Grant,
02:26
and
02:30
then after I got my Ph.D., I went and taught at the University of California
02:34
at Santa Barbara, from ‘83 on.
02:39
I had a joint appointment in geography and environmental studies, so I was teaching
02:45
watershed science among other things.
02:49
The Andrews and its work on watershed experiments came up
02:54
in the course of that teaching.
02:56
It also came up in my Ph.D., which was about deforestation in East Africa.
03:04
I searched the literature for all kinds, whatever studies were
03:07
available, about deforestation and its effects on soils and other ecosystem
03:12
properties, and a lot of the research was from the Andrews at that time.
03:19
It wasn’t all that directly applicable to semi-arid East Africa, but it was evident
03:26
to me in 1980 and ‘81 when I was doing a literature search for my Ph.D. research,
03:32
that the literature on these very general topics like hydrologic responses was
03:38
quite dominated by particular places where they did a lot of long-term research.
03:46
Places like Hubbard Brook and the Andrews.
03:48
So,
03:56
while I was at Santa Barbara, my research was on watersheds
04:01
and soils.
04:02
And I was doing a lot of work in East Africa in Tanzania where I’d worked
04:06
for my Ph.D., and in Eritrea with my husband, who was doing his Ph.D. there.
04:14
And
04:18
you went around them.
04:21
You said you were in a graduate program with Gordon.
04:24
Where was that?
04:24
Johns Hopkins
04:24
Hopkins, okay.
04:24
I was at Hopkins.
04:27
And Reds Wolman served on both of our committees, so I think he’s the
04:32
person who should be identified as having a pivotal effect for me, in
04:42
that I came into the program at Hopkins with a background primarily in social
04:48
sciences and not much natural science.
04:51
I wrote this really ambitious Ph.D. proposal for a coming year programming
04:56
project that was going to optimize soil erosion and runoff and all
05:02
kinds of things in East Africa.
05:05
When I gave it to Reds to read, he gently suggested it might be useful to learn a
05:10
little bit of natural science, which got me started in recognizing that there were
05:19
a lot of science questions out there.
05:21
So, I really made the transition during my Ph.D. from somebody who was interested
05:25
in social sciences to somebody who is interested in natural sciences.
05:29
Because I made the connection, that for the most part, the social sciences that
05:34
I was studying were normative, and it was presumed that you could make normative
05:42
recommendations because you had good data.
05:46
So, it was really a question of how to apply values, and to make decisions
05:51
about how to manage natural resources.
05:54
But during the course of my Ph.D., I realized, that in East Africa anyway,
06:00
the basic data weren’t there, and so, normative decisions were a little bit,
06:05
almost irrelevant, because people didn’t know the first thing about the place.
06:11
Reds Wolman was really instrumental in helping me to make that shift.
06:18
Firstly, by recognizing I was trying to make it, and, secondly, by commenting
06:24
at various points that I was making this shift and that it’s a different direction.
06:29
Most people who make a shift like that go from a natural sciences
06:33
background into planning, and I was going the other direction.
06:38
I was working at that time, while I was doing my Ph.D., for “Resources for the
06:43
Future,” a private non-profit group in Washington D.C. that does policy analysis
06:50
and economic studies of natural resources. And Reds was not only the chairman of the
06:59
department that I was in at Hopkins, but he also happened to be the chairman of
07:03
the advisory board for “Resources for the Future,” by coincidence, when I was there.
07:11
He really helped me to gain a perspective and a sense of direction,
07:14
and was very encouraging of me.
07:18
I’m kind
07:20
of curious about your training.
07:22
You started in economics and international relations, and then moved into this Ph.D.
07:28
program for environmental economics.
07:28
The Ph.D. program in the department which Reds was the chair of for many years,
07:34
combined a social science part which was called, “A Program for Public Decision
07:41
Making,” with “Mathematics and Economics for Public Decision Making.” That was
07:45
the part of the program that I went into.
07:48
But the department also had faculty like Reds, who was a geomorphologist, sanitary
07:54
engineers, and a wide range of people in water chemistry and aquatic ecology.
08:03
So, in the course of the Ph.D. I was exposed to people like
08:06
Gordon, for example, who were doing science, or strict geomorphology,
08:13
and got more and more interested in
08:18
that aspect of it.
08:19
Gordon and I talked about this a little bit that, that Ph.D. group around Reds
08:23
Wolman was pretty interdisciplinary.
08:25
Very much so.
08:26
Well you know, Reds got his degree at Harvard and in a time period I
08:31
think when the numbers of people in academia were considerably smaller
08:38
[than today] , and there wasn’t so much a focus on specialization.
08:41
And so, it’s remarkable when I look around, I keep encountering people
08:48
that I knew in that program in a variety of different locations.
08:55
And they were, they became or they already were, a fairly
09:00
extraordinary group of people, the thesis students in that program.
09:03
Not just in our period, but also earlier periods.
09:08
So, something about the interdisciplinary nature.
09:14
Not only was a sense of interdisciplinary studies focused and fostered there, but
09:18
I think people were given the confidence to believe that it was possible for
09:23
them to do interdisciplinary work well.
09:26
And Reds really is a master of that himself, because he moves in all
09:32
different kinds of circles, and he manages to do it without overreaching
09:37
himself scientifically, somehow.
09:39
I think that was a really important role.
09:41
So, it sounds like you were attracted there, not by him so much, as the program.
09:48
Well, the interesting thing about how I ended up in that Hopkins graduate
09:52
program, was because in the beginning of my international relations
09:55
degree, a two-year program, the first year of it in Bologna, Italy.
10:00
In the first few weeks of the term, some high-ranking members of the
10:08
home campus in Baltimore [Johns Hopkins] came over to Bologna, as
10:12
a boondoggle, I think primarily.
10:14
But their one requirement was to meet with students while they were
10:18
there, and I met with three of them.
10:21
I met with a provost, and I don’t know, I can’t remember who they were.
10:26
But in the course of that first year, when I told people about what I was
10:31
interested in doing, which at that time I described as alternative energy
10:36
strategies for developing countries, Reds name kept being recommended to me
10:42
as somebody that I ought to work with.
10:44
So, I eventually decided to pursue that and called him up.
10:48
That’s how I got into the program.
10:51
The program that you were in?
10:53
It’s part of Hopkins, but it’s called, “The School for
10:57
Advanced International Studies.”
10:59
Okay.
10:59
It’s part of Johns Hopkins University, but the program is housed in
11:04
Washington D.C. and in Bologna.
11:06
It gives people a Masters of Arts in International Relations.
11:10
And most of the people who do that degree go on to work for multinational
11:14
banks, The World Bank, USAID, or
11:23
they take diplomatic posts in different places.
11:24
And let’s see, where did you do your BA?
11:25
My bachelor’s degree was in economic development.
11:28
Which institution?
11:30
At Hampshire College.
11:32
Okay.
11:32
Hampshire is kind of like Evergreen [in Washington state]
11:37
. Hampshire was established in 1970 as an experimental college.
11:41
It has no grades and no credits.
11:43
You work your way through the program by establishing a series
11:46
of contacts with individual faculty members to do pieces of work.
11:53
I chose it because I had been able to do well in a graded system, I had a
12:02
really high class ranking, high SAT scores, and it was clear to me by the
12:06
time I was applying to college when I was about 17, that I wanted to find an
12:11
environment where I would be challenged.
12:14
Where I’d be allowed to try to challenge myself rather than to
12:17
look for external challenges like a graded and structured system.
12:24
So, that’s why I chose that place, and I did have some fairly good
12:28
science teachers at Hampshire, although I didn’t focus on science.
12:32
I think they helped me also to gain a sense that science
12:39
[career-wise] was doable.
12:40
It wasn’t outside of the realm of possibilities.
12:45
And they encouraged you to go on and do graduate work, but
12:50
not necessarily in science?
12:52
Actually, I was warned away from doing economics in graduate school, and
12:57
then, I chose international relations.
12:58
I was trying to choose between being an interpreter or translator,
13:03
because I had learned a number of different languages and was
13:07
considering doing that as a career.
13:09
But fortunately, I didn’t get accepted into doing that, because in retrospect
13:14
I can see it would have not been right.
13:16
I realized, about the time I was entering graduate school that I didn’t want
13:22
to be the one doing the translating.
13:22
I wanted to be the person whose work was translated or interpreted.
13:31
So the focus on East Africa came out of -- [last word covered by Jones’s response]
13:37
Well, I was interested in energy, alternative energy strategies,
13:41
for developing countries.
13:42
And I had a friend who worked for USAID and was posted to Tanzania, which is
13:49
a place that I had been interested in as a child because of “Lucy” and the
13:56
archeological discoveries. So, I took advantage of the opportunity to go
14:01
out and visit him, and then, I chose to do my Ph.D. project there. By that
14:08
time, I realized that alternative energy for most developing countries
14:12
just didn’t work too well [Chuckle].
14:15
So, that was what got me into doing deforestation work.
14:20
So then, when you finished your Ph.D., you were drawn to Oregon State University
14:27
by your connections with Gordon [Grant]
14:30
? First of all, when I was teaching for eight years at Santa Barbara, and
14:34
then included in that period, I was teaching watershed science as well as
14:39
soils and some other geography courses and environmental impact assessments.
14:46
I called up Gordon to request the literature on watershed
14:53
studies, which he sent to me.
14:56
It was all done around
15:05
wood ants, so he sent me that literature and I was then aware how much more
15:11
there was than I had even uncovered during my Ph.D., that was about the
15:16
impact of land-use change in monitored watersheds, that had been done in
15:24
the western Cascades of Oregon.
15:26
I was early in my career at
15:37
Santa Barbara.
15:39
Maybe we could talk a little bit about your first impressions working at the
15:45
Andrews, the first time you came out here.
15:49
Let’s see, did you start working there before you began with the OSU faculty?
15:55
When living in Santa Barbara, my husband and I, and he’s British;
16:01
he did not like Southern California because it was too materialistic,
16:10
wealth-oriented, TV-oriented, and so forth.
16:11
We were looking around for another a place to live that was different,
16:11
and the university was limited because it didn’t have forestry.
16:11
Also, I was in soils and there wasn’t a soils department.
16:12
So, we were looking around for a university that would
16:17
meet our needs better, and a
16:31
Tanzanian colleague was on a one-year leave at OSU, so we came up to
16:35
meet with him in 1987 in March.
16:39
We both really remember that visit, because we both had drove up from
16:44
Eugene in the valley [Willamette] in the springtime, and when we went to the
16:47
bookstore it was full of all these books on environmental subjects that we liked.
16:52
We thought, “Boy, if we had a chance to come to Oregon, this university
16:57
seems to have the range of different things that we’re both interested in.”
17:02
In 1989, Scott was working on his Ph.D. and we needed to take a leave of
17:09
absence to help him finish his research.
17:13
We planned to spend a year in Eritrea working on his research, and we
17:20
got to Britain at that time when Eritrea was at war, so the way you
17:24
got into Eritrea was through Sudan.
17:27
The Sudanese government for some reason denied Scott’s visa, so
17:30
we were in Scotland for a summer trying to figure out how he
17:36
would ever finish his dissertation.
17:36
He applied for research assistant jobs, and
18:01
got a job as research assistant in a soils department here, so we moved here.
18:06
We actually moved here to Corvallis in September of 1989, and I was still on
18:11
the faculty at Santa Barbara at the time.
18:15
Then we had Megan,
18:20
but while I was pregnant with Megan, I went back to Santa
18:22
Barbara to teach for a quarter.
18:24
But, I was beginning to make connections with people up here because Scott
18:27
was here, we were living here and I was talking to people on the campus.
18:30
And I got to know Logan [Norris] . Well, part of the reason we had decided to
18:37
come, to move here, was that Logan Norris, who you may have you interviewed
18:44
-- I’ve talked to him.
18:46
-- He came to a conference in Edinburgh that summer of ‘89 when we were in
18:49
Scotland, and we were debating about whether or not Scott could take this
18:53
job and should we move to Corvallis.
18:55
We talked to him about our situation and he was very encouraging about
18:59
possibilities for both of us.
19:01
After we moved here, I didn’t have a job.
19:04
But Logan and I talked, and I realized that I could apply for
19:08
an NSF grant to come here as a visiting faculty member for a year.
19:13
In 1990 I wrote a proposal to do that, building on soils research, African-type
19:21
soils research collections, that I would do in the drier part of Eastern Oregon.
19:26
That got funded, so I got a year’s money to be a visiting faculty member
19:30
in the Forest Science Department [OSU] , for the ‘91-’92 year, and I was
19:34
housed in the [USFS] Forestry Sciences Lab on the second floor, where I had
19:39
plenty of opportunities to go to the LTER meetings and talk to people.
19:43
That’s how I got an initial exposure.
19:47
In the meantime, I’d been sending letters to Gordon about whether or not we might
19:51
come, and he was circulating them.
19:53
So, when I showed up in town I got invited to LTER meetings with people like Fred,
19:58
who were very welcoming and encouraging about the general idea of participating.
20:05
But it really started to happen because once I got that grant funded.
20:17
The first year I lived here, I was up for tenure in the UC system.
20:21
I did get tenure in that system, but when I got this grant funded to come up here
20:25
for a year as a visiting professor, I was going to ask for another year of leave.
20:30
My department at that point in Santa Barbara realized I really didn’t want
20:34
to be there, so they asked me to resign.
20:40
I didn’t have to, but I did, and without a job.
20:43
The Geosciences Department at OSU during that first fall I was
20:50
here had three positions open, and I applied for one of them.
20:54
The dean told them they actually only had money for one, after they’d
21:00
listed applications for all three.
21:03
So, they had to agree on one candidate for three fields, and
21:07
by some miracle they chose me.
21:19
Somewhere in there, before I got the “Visiting Professorship
21:23
for Women” NSF grant, Gordon hired me as a research assistant
21:32
to work with him on stream-flow studies.
21:37
That was when we started work on something which eventually got
21:40
published last year in 1996. And that was when I first started to really
21:45
get my hands on actual Andrews’ data.
21:50
So it was the comparative watersheds study?
21:52
Right.
21:52
It’s the study of stream-flow, peak-flow responses to harvest.
22:00
That represented quite a transition for me, because over the years when I’d
22:04
been doing work like that in Africa, I’d always regarded the work and the
22:10
researchers here in the Northwest as sort of “rich” researchers.
22:15
They had so much money.
22:17
You can’t get money to do this kind of research in Africa, and
22:21
the long-term records aren’t there.
22:27
I had originally experienced some ambivalent feelings about LTERs.
22:33
It’s not that I saw them as being in competition with places where I
22:38
would have liked to see the money go.
22:40
But certainly, they were so much better off that I never regarded them
22:47
as needing anything in the way of a contribution.
22:50
And I certainly never saw myself as making a contribution in LTER,
22:55
nor did I ever see it as something that I would have wanted to do.
23:00
But when, for family reasons, I needed to be paid so that I
23:05
could be here in Corvallis with Scott and our baby, I started to
23:11
look at what had been done here.
23:15
Then, in early 1990,
23:18
I began to realize that the quality of the work that had been published,
23:24
the research that had been published using these long-term streamflow
23:27
records, was not very good.
23:30
And actually, there hadn’t been anything published to speak of for the last twenty
23:35
years, and so the records were twice as long as they had been when the last
23:39
time they had been published, and maybe the story looked a little different.
23:45
The more I got into it, the more I began to realize that in fact there
23:51
was a need for somebody to work on a piece of the story here, and
24:00
I sort of still feel that way about it.
24:03
So you’ve been aware of the research here in the forest [Andrews] , but it sounds
24:07
like hadn’t really had an interest in it because of your focus on other areas.
24:10
Right.
24:11
I’d read it and used the principles from it, as being instructive and
24:18
helpful in an abstract sort of way, for what I wished we had been
24:25
able to do in our African setting.
24:28
But it had never been an ambition of mine to work in it, in that area,
24:35
either geographically or conceptually.
24:41
Your understanding of what an experimental forest should be, at that point, sounds
24:46
like it was a little bit colored by what your hopes were for African research?
24:51
My impression of the Andrews was that it was very highly-regarded,
24:56
and it had a very, very high density of intelligent, educated minds
25:02
and dollars per unit area of land.
25:06
And if you relate it to what I regarded as the sort of global significance of the
25:13
kinds of problems they were looking at,
25:18
to me, they didn’t compete with the types of environmental problems that we were
25:23
trying to gain some understanding of
25:27
in Africa.
25:30
But then, after I’d been here for that little while, I began to see that
25:40
it really all hinges around those long-term records.
25:43
If those long-term records hadn’t been here, and if they hadn’t been
25:47
so good, that is, so well-maintained, and the ancillary information so
25:53
well-documented, then I might have lost patience with the whole thing.
26:01
But once I started
26:05
looking at the data, I thought, “If we can understand how hydrologic systems really
26:13
work in practice, anywhere, it’ll be here.
26:18
Because these are the best records.” And to my amazement, it hadn’t been done.
26:23
I had always presumed that records of that type would have long since been
26:27
analyzed by somebody who had far more background and more training than I had.
26:32
But it wasn’t the case, because they hadn’t been looked at.
26:37
And that’s also true, it’s still true, of the climate records at the Andrews.
26:41
David Greenland [Univ.
26:42
of Oregon] has done a quite a little bit the last five years.
26:45
But when I came here in 1990, those records [climate] had
26:48
lain untouched for a long time.
26:51
And it’s a function of the way the LTER is funded, that it’s funded to do
26:55
the monitoring and not the analysis.
26:58
Which isn’t something we can do anything about.
27:05
So,
27:08
it sounds like your interests changed a little bit after you made
27:09
that realization about the data availability and the lapses in records.
27:14
There were a number of things that got me interested.
27:21
A big factor was,
27:25
I had not been able to do any significant collaboration in eight years at the
27:29
University of California, probably because I was not yet a mature scientist.
27:31
I didn’t know how
27:34
to
27:37
interact
27:40
with that community of people.
27:40
Also, partly because I was working on a topic that was of little
27:43
interest to any of my colleagues.
27:45
Because it was abroad, they couldn’t understand it and
27:49
they didn’t care about it.
27:51
But partly because the institution, University of California, is
27:55
strongly-hierarchical and very competitive, and there was no
28:00
community of scientists there.
28:05
As soon as I got to Corvallis, I began to sense what it was like to live and work
28:12
in a place where there is a community of scientists who share and interact
28:18
and aren’t competing, and don’t see themselves as the pinnacle of the pyramid.
28:26
I
28:30
think the most attractive feature to me about making the decision to come to
28:36
OSU, which as an institution was much less prestigious and I took a salary
28:41
cut and all those kinds of things,
28:47
was OSU and the Corvallis community of scientists, which for me
28:52
includes the Forest Service people.
28:52
That was really
29:01
the factor that attracted me.
29:06
An awful lot of it was attributable to my
29:15
time early on working in the lab, when I saw human interactions of
29:24
a consistently much higher quality than anything I had seen
29:28
at the University of California.
29:30
And it wasn’t just the interactions between the people on
29:38
the “top of the pole,” not just the faculty, it was interactions like the way
29:45
Fred Swanson would talk to high school students or the undergraduates he’d
29:51
hired for the summer who were crunching numbers in the lab. There was a sense of
29:58
openness and respect for people, which
30:06
for me is very much associated with Fred, [Swanson] because
30:08
that’s the way he operates.
30:10
But I also had the impression that he set a tone, or he was the person
30:17
I could see operating according to a tone that may just be a Corvallis
30:21
thing, or may just be an OSU thing, or it might be the department;
30:28
I don’t where it comes from.
30:29
But to me it was so much more inspiring to work in an environment characterized
30:34
by those kinds of interactions than the one I’d been in, that I
30:42
was just really thrilled to be here.
30:43
Out of all the three different research universities that you were
30:46
at, Johns Hopkins, OSU and UC-Santa Barbara, you were at different levels
30:51
when you were at each institution.
30:53
If you were to compare those three institutions in terms of potentials
30:57
for interdisciplinary exchange, how would you characterize them?
31:02
That’s an interesting question.
31:05
Looking back, in the department at Hopkins,
31:13
there were some very powerful antagonisms among faculty members
31:20
from different disciplines, or, as well, within disciplines.
31:26
But for some reason, that didn’t inhibit the graduate students
31:34
from crossing disciplines.
31:40
I know about half a dozen or eight who were there at the time,
31:45
and they’ve all turned out to be really strong, interdisciplinary
31:49
scientists in their own right, now that they’re in their early 40’s.
31:55
I keep being reminded as I go to meetings and run into people from that
32:00
time, that I had never expected to see an environment that we all were given,
32:07
almost a subconscious training in the value, importance and do-ability
32:13
of interdisciplinary science.
32:17
That was very much talked about at Santa Barbara in the geography department,
32:22
but there was also, my perception was, that there was a very strong, overriding
32:29
feeling that you could also be wrong, which I think tended to hamper students.
32:38
The graduate students and the faculty in the department at Santa Barbara
32:42
have extraordinary individuals, each of whom, working in a particular
32:48
disciplinary area that may be synthetic, but the department itself,
32:55
I don’t know how effectively it’s offering interdisciplinary studies.
33:00
They do have a graduate training program that combines geography
33:03
and ecology, very much like ours.
33:08
But I’m not enough in touch to know whether that helped.
33:12
At the time,
33:15
the comments you’d get from graduate students were like, “I’m not sure I
33:18
should be doing a Ph.D. because I don’t want to be like you when I graduate.”
33:23
Because they didn’t like the way
33:27
we lived.
33:27
From what you said,
33:29
you didn’t feel very much drawn into collaborative
33:32
research while you were there.
33:34
Correct?
33:34
Right.
33:34
To a graduate student bringing the final version of a thesis; are you
33:35
bringing this box in just to impress me?
33:37
You really only need to bring in the pages I have to sign.
33:40
[Chuckle]
33:40
I will never let them separate.
33:45
You’ll never let them out of your sight?
33:47
Okay.
33:48
[Chuckle]
33:49
Actually, they’re all upside down.
33:51
Does it have to be black ink, or ought it to be black ink?
33:54
No idea.
33:55
Well, I’ll go get a black pen just to be -- [Interview interrupted]
33:57
Let me pick up back up here.
34:06
Kind of remind us where we left off; how would you characterize the advantages
34:10
and disadvantages of doing group research for a young faculty member?
34:15
You said it was something you wanted to do at UC-Santa Barbara, but didn’t
34:19
feel like it was conducive to that, or that the climate was conducive to that.
34:23
Was that an issue?
34:23
Well I guess that like most things, the advantages are
34:28
the same as the disadvantages; they just depend on your mood.
34:31
At Santa Barbara, not being able to collaborate was a disadvantage, and the
34:36
advantage was that you were independent.
34:41
Here, working with groups, the advantage is that you get to
34:45
interact and share ideas, and
34:50
the disadvantages are that you’re interdependent.
34:53
It seems there’s a lot of co-authored manuscripts, so you can’t just dash
34:58
off a manuscript and send it out.
34:59
You need to make sure it’s been worked on by your co-author, and
35:06
also, edited pretty thoroughly.
35:09
But on the whole, I would say the advantages far outweigh
35:15
the disadvantages.
35:18
That’s because it has a lot to do with factors I’m not
35:21
sure could work very well as
35:26
a paradigm, because I don’t actually know how it is that this climate for
35:32
research here actually came to be,
35:36
perhaps as a complicated function of things that are “Oregon-wise.” People are
35:40
nice in Oregon, and they’re more open, for example, compared to California.
35:45
That’s maybe because of a lower population density and people having a sense of being
35:47
less pressured to compete like “people on
36:01
the street.” [Hyper-competitive academic atmosphere.] This group consists of
36:06
a lot of people who are really nice,
36:12
and who presumably made a decision about being here that did not involve
36:18
necessarily seeking out the highest prestige institutions. Not that OSU
36:24
is low in prestige, it’s just that prestige or status may not have been
36:30
on the top of their criteria list for choosing a place to be, but they
36:33
chose Corvallis for family, lifestyle,
36:39
or academic-community reasons.
36:41
Or they just came here.
36:42
I mean, a lot of people who you have interviewed came here and stayed.
36:49
Yeah, often unintentionally.
36:53
Where are you from originally?
36:54
New England or
36:54
-- ? I grew up in
37:02
Maryland.
37:02
Yeah.
37:03
Once I moved to the West, I wasn’t attracted to the idea of
37:06
going back to the city or urban
37:12
environments.
37:12
But, I never considered myself a Californian after eight years of
37:15
living there, and yet, within a few months of living in Oregon, I
37:18
felt like I could be an Oregonian.
37:20
So, a sense of home, that’s something probably that’s shared
37:24
by a lot of the people who work at OSU and who work on the LTER.
37:29
And I know that sense of this being our home, that we want to take care
37:36
of it, contributes to a stewardship ethic or ethos among the people who
37:42
do ecosystem research at the Andrews.
37:45
And I know that place, the Andrews itself, has an enormous appeal and significance
37:53
at a whole bunch of levels for the people
37:59
who work there.
37:59
Have you worked at any other experimental forests?
38:03
Well, I worked in the Los Padres National Forest in Santa Barbara.
38:08
It’s not an experimental forest, but it’s a national forest in
38:11
a chaparral environment, and it didn’t have the grandeur of
38:18
the Andrews.
38:21
Few places do.
38:24
And
38:27
I visited and worked in the bush, cloud forests, and dry forests,
38:32
in various parts of Africa, some of which were quite pristine.
38:38
But
38:42
this combination of having a beautiful ecosystem, parts of
38:49
which are quite untouched by human hands, something which is
38:58
evocative of natural history, and a community of people who care about it;
39:09
I don’t know whether you’d find that in very many places,
39:13
certainly among the other LTER’s.
39:18
The other forest LTERs, they are second-growth forests, they don’t
39:22
have the primary forests the Andrews has since they’re places established
39:27
after farming hit the East Coast.
39:31
And the other ecosystems have all been quite significantly altered, with the
39:37
exception, there’s the Konza Prairie LTER site, a little teeny tract of
39:44
relatively undisturbed prairie in the middle of a bunch of farmland.
39:51
Maybe the people who worked there have a sense of being in contact
39:56
with the primeval forces that shape our environment in the absence of
40:01
development and human activity.
40:04
That may be a factor that brings together people who work on the Antarctic LTER.
40:12
But,
40:14
but on almost every count, the Andrews kind of outcompetes other places.
40:20
It’s been around so long, and not only has the vegetation been around, in some
40:26
cases for 500 years or longer, but the records of people paying attention to it
40:31
lovingly, are nearly 50 years old now.
40:35
That’s not true of any other LTER.
40:38
Even Hubbard Brook, I don’t think.
40:40
Coweeta has records, stream-flow records that go back to
40:45
the 1930’s,
40:48
so maybe there’s some similarities.
40:52
But the Andrews scores high on all possible criteria that you can
40:57
think of to measure a place by.
41:01
Had you done any work with Hubbard Brook at all?
41:04
No, but I have a pretty strong sense of what it was about because my family
41:09
has a camp on a lake in New Hampshire.
41:12
I spent a lot of my summers in a second-growth, deciduous mix,
41:16
conifer/deciduous mixed forest, up there.
41:21
My great aunt was a natural historian and wrote children’s books about
41:26
the natural history of that area.
41:28
So, I had a pretty strong sense about what the places were
41:38
like.
41:38
I’ve never visited Coweeta, but from growing up in Maryland and
41:43
thinking about the western Maryland part [Appalachia] of it, you sort of
41:49
have a sense.
41:51
So, the personal or community commitment to a place is what you’re identifying,
41:57
rather what is unique about the Andrews in conjunction with the primeval conditions?
42:02
Well, there’s something like a collective sense of awe about
42:10
the Andrews, the place, which transcends the people and the buildings, the roads
42:19
and the weather and everything else.
42:22
And
42:26
I think it’s reflected in a sense of respect for the place that
42:31
everybody who does work on it, shares.
42:32
And it’s a nice thing to share.
42:34
I mean, there are a lot of other things that people are going to do together,
42:37
but that’s what’s powerful for me.
42:41
Did that strike you right away or was that something that kind of grew on you?
42:44
Well, it did strike me very early when I went to visit the Andrews,
42:48
that individuals like Fred [Swanson] , whom I admired, had a very powerful
42:56
emotional connection with the place.
43:03
And
43:06
you look at Ted Dyrness, Al Levno, all in their own ways, there is
43:10
something there beyond a job, beyond having relatively close colleagues.
43:18
There’s something that keeps them going back there.
43:20
And I think it’s the place.
43:25
I can’t think of any other reasonable explanation.
43:33
That may not be what they tell you.
43:35
[Chuckle]
43:35
I think Ted has definitely, and Fred in his own way, said the same thing.
43:43
That’s actually a theme that’s emerged pretty quickly in this study, is
43:46
the various ways people have been drawn there, sometimes unsuspecting,
43:53
that changes the way they view themselves in relation to work.
43:58
Maybe we could talk a little bit about, where, since your arrival here at
44:03
the Andrews, what would you identify as your most important study sites?
44:08
Well, I did some work on a place called “The Island,” which is
44:15
actually a butte in Central Oregon on Lake Billy Chinook Reservoir.
44:28
It’s a place that hasn’t been grazed by domestic animals, nor burned very much.
44:34
So it has a nice, dry ecosystem feeling about it, without having cow pies.
44:49
[Chuckle] I feel very strongly connected still, although I’m not
44:53
doing any work there, to some of the places we worked on in Africa.
45:00
Scott’s Ph.D. study was conducted on a high plateau in Northern Eritrea
45:08
where much of the original vegetation is gone, but there are traces of human
45:13
settlement including rock carvings, that go back to the time of Jerusalem,
45:19
you know, that’s before Christ.
45:22
That
45:25
place has a powerful feel, because of the sense of the long-term
45:30
interweaving of climate, human activity and natural vegetation.
45:39
Those are some of the places.
45:47
I’ve gathered from what you said that Scott has been kind of a close
45:50
working associate over the years.
45:53
I was going to ask you who, away from the Andrews and OSU, have been
45:56
your closest working associates?
45:58
Well, Scott has been, and
46:04
a couple of students.
46:07
So, let’s see, the student who did the study on Central Oregon was part
46:14
of my visiting grant, was a masters student at OSU in forest science.
46:19
And she is a mature woman, older than I am, with
46:26
whom I’ve had a very successful working relationship.
46:31
She’s a very hard worker, a very bright woman.
46:33
Who was that?
46:36
She’s also English.
46:37
Her name?
46:38
Oh, her name is Christine Roberts.
46:39
Is
46:45
she still in town here?
46:47
She was in Eugene awhile, and now she’s started her Ph.D. in
46:52
British Columbia in mycology.
46:54
Which university?
46:56
Right,
46:59
sorry.
46:59
The University of Victoria.
47:00
Oh, okay.
47:11
Pretty much all of my research energy since I’ve been here has been
47:17
absorbed either by the work I’m doing on the Andrews or related long-term
47:23
records in western Oregon, or with students, whom I’m almost all jointly
47:31
supervising, either with Fred or
47:36
Gordon.
47:36
Oh.
47:36
Mike Peters, working on projects either in the western Cascades or in
47:41
the Coast Range of Oregon, and so,
47:46
there’s these other ties that don’t relate necessarily
47:52
specifically
47:56
to the Andrews, but involve the same people.
47:56
Let me pick up on that here.
47:56
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your strategy or philosophy
48:01
about recruiting research assistants or graduate students,
48:06
and how this works over the years?
48:14
Most of the students that I’ve worked with have been walk-ons in the sense that they
48:18
were people who had already decided to come to OSU for one reason or another, and
48:22
then, I met them after a couple of years.
48:24
And they are people who came to me with an interest, usually in spatial
48:30
pattern analysis of one kind or another.
48:33
And an interest in processes, like fire or wind or stream flow or something
48:40
like that and then they’d work together to develop a workable thesis project.
48:47
An awful lot of that has involved very imaginative and creative suggestions from
48:55
Fred or Gordon about ideas that they’ve had for a long time, which now can be
49:02
looked at rigorously, when you combine the labor-power of a student, the capital
49:08
equipment of the laboratory, the GIS long-term records, and somebody like me
49:13
who’s willing to sort of go after some of the details in terms of advising.
49:19
So, actually, we have got too many students, I think we have.
49:22
I have a list on my wall in my office of about 30 or 40 students, whose committees
49:32
I’m serving on or have served on in one capacity or another.
49:36
Last spring before Gareth [son] was born, I had four Ph.D.
49:39
students and one masters’ student.
49:41
So,
49:44
it’s been a pretty busy time, and that’s indicative of how productive
49:48
the interactions have been.
49:50
Primarily with Jeff and also with
49:53
Gordon on geomorphology.
49:54
So, the instruction of graduate students is actually more of a
49:54
collaborative process like the research?
49:54
It is, actually, very much so.
49:57
Do you tend to work
50:04
very much with Forest Service technicians or post-docs?
50:09
Well, I brought two post doctorates to the lab who work there now;
50:15
Sherri Johnson and David Post.
50:18
They’ve both been here for a-year-and-a-half or so.
50:23
I’ve worked an awful lot with Barbara Marx.
50:28
She’s been very helpful to me in computer programming applications
50:36
that I needed worked on.
50:38
I also have interacted a
50:43
lot with George Lienkaemper,
50:52
who’s wonderful, as part of the [land use history geography] project.
50:54
It’s nice to interact with George because he has a personal
50:57
history with Andrews, and also,
51:00
a disciplinary background in geology.
51:03
And it’s been nice to work with Barbara Marks, who I happen to have
51:04
known for years because she was at Santa Barbara with Danny Marks
51:10
in the same department I was at, in the same years I was there.
51:13
So,
51:16
she moved up here about the same time also?
51:18
I think so, the mid-eighties.
51:24
[Brief interruption with
51:44
interview by child.]
51:47
I’ll ask you just one more question.
51:48
This might take you a little while to answer.
51:52
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your philosophy or understanding of
51:56
who is your target audience, or who are you researching and writing for?
52:02
Great question.
52:14
There are some boundaries around that that are defined by my job and the fact
52:22
that I work for Oregon State University.
52:24
So, my target audience is the people, primarily, who read professional
52:30
journals, academic journals.
52:36
I see those people primarily as being scientists like myself, but
52:42
also, I know that those journals are referred to by policy-makers,
52:50
sort of directly or indirectly.
52:52
Since I’ve been at OSU, I’ve gained an increased appreciation for how
52:59
important that other audience is.
53:01
Although it’s not an audience that’s recognized by the people who do
53:07
promotion and tenure reviews in the university, it’s a powerful audience,
53:12
and one that has had a huge effect on the way the LTER has been managed.
53:16
But, the
53:25
way I think about it is that
53:30
the audience that I’m writing to is an audience of people who have believed a
53:36
certain number of relatively simplistic principles about how, for example,
53:43
watersheds behave or soils behave.
53:47
And are ready to question those, or to quantify them if they’re
53:55
not going to question them.
53:56
So,
54:01
it’s not an audience who’s looking for textbook kind of messages, simple-minded
54:08
principles that are un-quantified, but an audience that is looking for
54:12
a slightly more complicated story.
54:14
And the complexity arises from geography.
54:20
That is to say that, fundamentally,
54:26
places behave because of the kinds of places that they are.
54:32
So, when you do research about the Andrews, you use it as a basis for
54:54
talking about -- [interruption by child] . Research from the Andrews
54:56
has widely been extrapolated to the whole rest of the Pacific Northwest.
55:01
Like I said earlier, this was a motivating factor for me because I like
55:05
the idea that what can be discovered at the Andrews might be useful to people
55:09
in Africa or elsewhere who don’t have the same kinds of long-term records.
55:15
That’s another piece of an audience, scientists or other people working in
55:19
other ecosystems, who might be able to read what we are learning about the
55:23
Andrews and translate it to their place.
55:26
So, a key part of that is learning how it is that what we learn about
55:31
the Andrews gets modified if you move outside the Andrews, even locally
55:36
within, for example, western Oregon.
55:40
You know, with certain things that happen in some watersheds of the Andrews
55:45
may not have happened exactly that same way or had that big of a response
55:49
or taken that long to recover, both from the south of here or north of
55:55
here.
55:57
Your peak-flow study would be an example of that?
55:58
The peak-flow study is an example of that because we started out looking at three
56:03
small watersheds in the lower elevations of the Andrews, and then I expanded to
56:08
look at the other small, paired-watershed studies within the Andrews, and found
56:13
they were responding somewhat differently than the ones we had looked at initially.
56:17
And then I got the long-term records that were collected by the same people
56:21
who did design the same experiments up at the Andrews and about a
56:26
hundred kilometers south and north of here, Coyote Creek and Bull Run.
56:30
So, now I have a paper that’s ready to go out that looks at ten paired-watersheds
56:36
and tries to extract how their responses over time varied, not only
56:40
according to treatment, but according to what kind of places they are.
56:44
Actually, treatment doesn’t explain much at all of how the watersheds responded.
56:49
It’s their inherent characteristics that explain how they respond.
56:53
And that’s the really interesting theme, and it’s one that quite
56:58
resonates with geography.
57:00
Sure, yeah.
57:00
And with my desire that the work that should come out of those
57:06
places, that the wealth at the Andrews should be comprehensible and
57:10
usable to a much broader audience.
57:16
I should probably let you go here, because I don’t want to ride home in the dark.
57:20
As you were talking it occurred to me, I’ve asked this question of most
57:24
the people I’ve interviewed, and most of them have been scientists,
57:27
and here you’re a social scientist, and may have a different take on it.
57:31
I wonder if you could briefly comment on your perception of whether there’s
57:38
a difference between basic science and applied science, or, if there
57:43
is, how would characterize that?
57:45
Well, it’s an interesting question because the National Science Foundation
57:52
has been recently queried by Congress where people in Congress have a
57:58
limited understanding of the value of basic science as opposed to applied
58:06
science.
58:07
So, it’s easier to show the relevance of applied science because it’s closer to
58:12
practical, changing questions, usually.
58:16
But, that’s also the weakness of applied science because it may be too narrowly
58:19
focused on the issues of the day.
58:23
So,
58:25
what’s really neat about the Andrews is that it’s an environment
58:29
in which you don’t have to worry too much about the distinction.
58:34
I would say in the case of the Andrews, basic science
58:37
is those long-term data sets.
58:40
That are, you know, the heart monitor on the streams and
58:44
the rainfall in the forest.
58:48
And, trying to understand how they work, what controls this stuff.
58:56
The applied part comes in when we’re asked to interpret how those creeks are,
59:02
for example, being modified by people, usually, and what we ought to do about it.
