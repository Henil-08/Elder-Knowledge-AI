00:00
There were
00:03
things I might have worded differently that I felt was probably
00:06
not worth bringing up because of the sort of political license
00:12
you ought to be able to enjoy.
00:17
Things
00:20
like that.
00:20
I don’t see anything that I felt any heartburn about.
00:22
Let’s put it that way.
00:22
I might have used a different term, but I had no
00:28
strong basis for a word that you and Fred [Swanson] had used or said, that
00:34
was inappropriate.
00:36
Just one I wouldn’t have chosen, things like that.
00:40
[Art and Max were discussing a draft outline for Max’s research/book
00:40
project that became Necessary Work, a history of the Andrews Forest.]
00:40
Okay.
00:40
You know, if anything occurs to you want to change, this would be a good
00:41
time for me to get some feedback, especially on the chapter organization.
00:46
Why don’t
00:55
I give you just a couple of comments on that, because I thought my memory last
00:58
weekend [was imperfect] , and this is unfair to you actually, and I should
00:59
remember it [the outline] that long, but
01:03
I have difficulty with some of the details.
01:07
I’ve got a copy of it in here somewhere, if it would help.
01:13
This is
01:18
it.
01:18
It’s stuck together.
01:18
Nothing major,
01:46
it would be in
01:46
– Now, what I was trying to do is layer some history together instead of trying
01:51
to deal with an entire period in one
01:53
-- Right.
01:55
-- chapter.
02:00
Let’s say, the policy concerns
02:02
-- Uh-huh.
02:04
-- Really didn’t emerge until,
02:09
maybe the mid-eighties.
02:13
There was an awful lot of research going on in the seventies, ‘70 to
02:18
’80, that put us in a sometimes awkward position of being the only
02:25
people around having the information for whatever environmental concerns
02:30
that emerged in the mid-to-late ’80s.
02:32
Did not quite know whether that was what you were after here.
02:37
One thing I was really getting into with the data, especially, was the beginning
02:40
of these kinds of environmental concerns.
02:43
Concerns?
02:44
Public concerns about the sort of pressures that come on the federal
02:46
agency, and how that translates in questions that were posed.
02:51
Jerry Franklin might tell you that the kinds of research we were
02:55
doing during the Coniferous Forest Biome [International Biological
02:58
Program] years in the early ‘70s,
03:00
Okay.
03:00
This was in response to the wave of environmentalism that was
03:05
sweeping the country, the first Earth Day and that sort of thing.
03:09
I came out here
03:12
from graduate school into what I thought was kind of a
03:16
Neanderthal environmental ethic.
03:20
That they weren’t sensitive to that, except they were, they were
03:24
sympathetic, but not sensitive?
03:28
They were listening to it and it resonated, but they
03:30
weren’t actively engaged.
03:33
And their research was being conducted
03:37
pretty much from the idea that we need to know how the system works
03:43
in order to wisely manage it.
03:44
That’s a perfectly legitimate thing to come from, but
03:51
my perception was, it wasn’t reacting to environmental things.
03:55
Jerry occasionally seems to take credit for having done a
03:57
lot of research in old growth.
04:00
Well,
04:02
that’s about being well positioned when the old-growth issue came out.
04:06
To me, that was just circumstantial.
04:10
We went out to one research site to conduct research, focused on that
04:16
one research site, which happened to have an old-growth stand.
04:19
The reason we were there wasn’t because it was an old-growth site,
04:23
but because the previous scientist, Dick Fredriksen, had invested a lot of
04:26
energy and time in describing these two watersheds which were being set up for
04:32
manipulation [Watersheds 9 and 10 at H.J. Andrews] , so we could do energy flow
04:35
and nutrient cycling on those watersheds.
04:37
The stage was set and he had chosen them because of their ease of access,
04:42
not because of what kind of vegetation
04:47
they have.
04:47
A lot of the work we did at the Andrews Forest
04:53
did in fact study the processes in old-growth forests.
04:59
That was part of it.
05:00
It wasn’t all the planning
05:03
that was done.
05:03
I did so much in old growth, because so much of the Andrews was old growth.
05:07
The Andrews was our study site.
05:10
On a proportional basis, you look at those budgets in the early ‘70’s, and
05:16
you say, “Okay, this amount of money was going for research in old-growth patches.
05:20
And this amount of money for research in plantations or young stands.” It wouldn’t
05:28
surprise me a bit if you saw, well, I know you’d see a disproportionately
05:32
large amount in the young stands.
05:36
And it may not be the majority of it, but only 1/3 of the Andrews is young stands,
05:40
maybe 45 or 50 percent of the budget was going to research in young stands.
05:44
And yet we’re colored a group that studied old growth because
05:48
we did study old growth.
05:49
It was there.
05:49
It was part of it.
05:51
And nobody else was bothering to, in forestry circles, because this
05:56
was the stuff that was to be cut, converted to thrifty young stands.
06:02
I’m not going to make a big issue of it, because
06:06
we did end up
06:10
in the forefront of a lot of the old-growth issues by virtue
06:14
of having done what we did.
06:16
But it wasn’t of any clairvoyance that this was going to be much of an issue.
06:20
I really get heartburn when I hear that suggested.
06:23
I really do.
06:24
I liked your point about access for those study sites.
06:28
When you say access, what do you mean?
06:30
You can get to it in the wintertime.
06:32
Okay.
06:33
Was that because of the road system?
06:34
If they were next to a road structure.
06:37
Next to existing roads.
06:38
Yeah?
06:39
And they weren’t even on the Andrews.
06:43
Dick Fredriksen picked these because the lowest elevation sites were
06:49
Watersheds 9 and Watersheds 10.
06:51
Uh-huh.
06:52
And they’re right along this main curve there or here [pointing to
06:55
a map] . So, they were just short.
06:57
This one’s right on the main road.
06:58
This one’s just off it 100 yards.
07:00
And that’s why they were picked.
07:03
You could get to them.
07:04
Nothing is plowed in the wintertime, and this usually had logging traffic
07:07
and so it was pounded flat or kept down.
07:11
Yeah.
07:12
And we went past Watersheds 1, 2, and 3, in the Andrews, as you had
07:16
to go way the hell up into here, or here [pointing to a map] , before you
07:20
could get to an undisturbed watershed.
07:23
The creation of the road system
07:26
and logging units have been put in without prolonged consideration
07:33
for future unit watershed studies.
07:37
You can take just about any one of these units, like this one right
07:39
here, flops-over a ridge, this one, no this isn’t a watershed.
07:48
This one flops-over
07:52
a ridge instead of being within the boundaries of our watershed.
07:57
Every time they put in a unit, it seems like they picked a place…here’s
08:02
one that flops-over a ridge, this one,
08:07
no this one doesn’t, this one does.
08:11
In part, it was because the kind of logging system that they used.
08:14
You wanted a ridge on which to plant the landing system.
08:18
They went on either side of it because it was more efficient.
08:22
In the process, they buggered all the bases up to it.
08:27
Other than the ones that had already been established.
08:29
Then these roads were established.
08:30
And there’s some opportunities up in here still.
08:34
In the late ‘70s,
08:39
when we
08:42
went
08:44
through the exercise of assessing how many undisturbed watersheds
08:47
that are second-order or larger
08:52
left on the Andrews Forest, we came up with four, out of roughly forty.
08:57
Hmm.
08:59
10 percent.
09:04
Yeah, 10 percent.
09:04
Sites that Dick Fredriksen chose, established there near the road,
09:09
would be on National Forest land, and so their survival would depend
09:14
a great deal on land managers?
09:15
Special use permit.
09:17
And that was no problem.
09:18
We’ve rarely, rarely run up against hassles going off the forest.
09:26
In fact, I’m carrying for Stan Gregory’s group, a special use permit in my name
09:33
for a site that they may never go back to, but we did a bunch of work on in
09:38
the early ‘80s for about three years.
09:41
This particular
09:44
clear-cut got a special-use permit to do some work, and I just feel
09:50
they might want to go back in once the canopy in there closes.
09:53
So, I end up keeping that one active under my own name.
09:56
But, it’s really easy.
09:59
The Willamette’s been extremely cooperative in contrast to some of the
10:06
conditions that exist in other places I’ve seen around the nation, where the research
10:10
community and management community are really at odds with each other.
10:13
Usually, they treat each other with benign neglect.
10:16
It’s not something I want to get into here, but
10:21
let me back up here a little bit and get started.
10:22
I want to talk a little bit about when you started to work
10:24
at the Andrews in ‘70, ’71.
10:26
Is that right?
10:26
Yeah.
10:27
You mentioned earlier that you had the intent of getting two
10:29
years of Northwest experience, and then going back to New England.
10:33
Would you set the framework a little bit?
10:35
What was your academic and personal background priority at the time you
10:38
made that decision to come out here?
10:40
Prior to coming out here, I went to the University of Vermont
10:45
and the University of Maine.
10:48
Worked for two years at Brookhaven National Laboratory
10:50
as a research associate
11:12
there.
11:26
I went there to work on a nutrient-cycling study, and when I got there,
11:32
their pesticide study person had taken a job teaching high school.
11:45
I ended up working on pesticide accumulation in food chains.
11:49
Quite different from my plant physiology and nutrient-cycling background
11:53
that I had been trained in, but it
11:56
was fun.
11:57
I had a great time.
11:58
Yeah.
11:58
Among other things, it’s so hard today to get a permit to collect wild animals.
12:07
Even to collect, let’s say, a half a dozen herring gulls right now, you might run
12:11
a year-long gauntlet to get permission.
12:13
Hmm.
12:14
I was given carte blanche to collect anything on the east coast.
12:20
I had a permit from the Boston office of the Fish and Wildlife Service
12:24
[U.S] that authorized me to collect fish and game in abundance of numbers
12:32
appropriate for purposes of a study on accumulation of pesticides.
12:35
Hmm.
12:36
It was crazy in some respects, so we capitalized on natural mortality.
12:45
We were collecting all kinds of stuff.
12:45
Who were you working with back there?
12:47
A fellow named George Woodwell.
12:47
He was a
12:54
famous ecologist who’s done a lot of different things.
13:01
At any rate, I left there and went to graduate school at
13:03
the University of Georgia.
13:07
When I left the University of Georgia, I was
13:13
kind of shopping around in shotgun fashion for anything that was available.
13:19
I was in a pretty tight financial bind, and was pretty eager to
13:25
get the first thing that was going to provide me a paycheck.
13:30
I had this offer in Boise, Idaho.
13:33
The guy kept telling me he’d hire me, hire me, hire me, every time
13:36
I’d talk to him, but the paperwork had been lost one place or another.
13:40
Then I got the job offer here, and it sounded really good.
13:44
They basically
13:48
said they had this set of tasks they’d like you to do, and
13:50
asked, what are your interests?
13:50
And what would you like to do in addition?
13:50
We could always
13:55
fit these areas of interest,
13:58
and so, come on up.
14:00
Who was the person that was doing the hiring then?
14:02
Jerry Franklin and Dick Warring were the two in-charge at
14:10
that time.
14:10
They were the two local co-investigators.
14:14
The original grant was to the University of Washington and Oregon State University.
14:18
A fellow named Stan Gessel was the principal investigator at the
14:22
University of Washington, along with someone else’s name I can’t remember.
14:29
Dick Waring and Jerry Franklin were the co-investigators here at this campus.
14:37
I don’t know the exact history, but I had sent out letters to at least three
14:41
of the people here on this campus, saying I admire your research, here are copies
14:47
of my work in certain areas, and that I am now interested in seeking employment.
14:54
Do you know of any niches?
14:56
I’d really appreciate hearing from you.
14:58
It was a different hiring world that what’s out there today, that’s for sure.
15:06
There’s not a snowball’s chance in hell of that happening now.
15:13
Basically, they made up their mind to hire me before Dick Fredriksen happened
15:17
to be on campus for other purposes.
15:20
They told him to look me up, and see whether or not this was somebody that
15:26
looked as good in reality as he did on paper.
15:29
That was what you were talking about earlier?
15:30
So, he staggers up to me in the bar and introduces himself.
15:33
It was very funny.
15:40
Who had you been working with in Georgia?
15:42
My major professor was a fellow named Philip Johnson, who I had worked
15:47
with in the Arctic a year earlier.
15:47
He was a plant physiologist, and they
15:53
called
15:56
him “Mr. Philip Scientist.”
15:57
You worked with him in the Arctic?
16:00
I worked with him in the Arctic.
16:03
He and I were very, very good friends.
16:04
And he was a wonderful mentor and
16:09
a good teacher, one of those people who just virtually turns
16:13
every situation into a learning experience for people around him.
16:18
And doing it without being a horse’s ass about it.
16:21
Fun to be with.
16:22
High-energy guy.
16:26
Among the members of the committee are
16:33
two people in particular had national reputations – Karl Malk and Dick
16:37
Wiegert, who has worked in thermal ecosystems and done a lot of population
16:49
and nutrient cycling monitoring.
16:49
And a fellow named Frank Golley,
16:53
who was one of the few early people to look at energetics
16:59
in terrestrial ecosystems.
17:05
Another member of the committee was a fellow named Karl Malk,
17:09
who was very, very creative
17:13
in many ways, probably the best scientist of the four.
17:16
He had a happy addiction to golf
17:23
[laughter], as he’d really rather be out on the links than sitting down writing.
17:31
I got a lot out of those four people in particular.
17:34
Eugene Odum was there.
17:35
He was interesting to be with once in a while.
17:37
There
17:41
were people like Dak Crossley, Lynn Swain, and others who
17:45
had national reputations who
17:51
would go outside their interests;
17:55
frankly, good thinkers, clear thinkers.
17:58
Was that what attracted you to Georgia?
18:01
Actually, it’s quirky, and kind of embarrassing.
18:09
I was accepted at three institutions: University of Wisconsin, to work with
18:14
Jim Boyle, a soil scientist now in the faculty at the [OSU] College of Forestry.
18:18
He was department head of Forest Resources for many years.
18:25
I liked the idea a lot of working with Jim on forest soils.
18:28
At the time, he was working on the idea of plants being able to create special
18:36
microhabitats around their roots, in which a lot of other things happen.
18:42
That was interesting stuff.
18:45
And that one had a big, fat, juicy fellowship.
18:48
I had a good National Science Foundation Fellowship anyway,
18:52
but that one was much better.
18:55
But, my wife at the time, didn’t want to live in a cold climate.
18:59
So, we thought that maybe Wisconsin was a great opportunity, but it wasn’t
19:07
something she was excited about.
19:08
My other opportunity was at Yale.
19:10
I had been accepted with another soil scientist
19:15
by the name of Grant Boyd.
19:17
He was a
19:22
brilliant scholar and a wonderful person.
19:26
But my sister lived nearby.
19:27
She and my folks were having problems at the time, and
19:33
it was getting ugly enough that I felt that if I was in that proximity,
19:39
I was going to get sucked into it.
19:39
I just didn’t want any complications.
19:42
Keep it simple.
19:51
Hmm.
19:52
It
19:57
was a strange one, because I wrote what I thought were very matter-of-fact
20:03
letters for both Wisconsin and Yale, saying that I’d chosen to go to Georgia.
20:11
Jim Boyle was very diplomatic.
20:13
He called and said, “Well, you got to think about your future, your diploma.
20:17
Georgia didn’t have as much marketability as a diploma from Wisconsin.” Boyle was
20:22
also a student of this Grant Boyd, who said, “If I were you, I’d go to Yale.
20:23
That’s where I’d go.
20:23
Because there’s no place with a better, more marketable degree.”
20:23
He said, “It’s your decision. I’m not trying to pressure you.
20:24
Just wanted to give you some fatherly advice.” I appreciated that.
20:32
I thought about and agonized over this.
20:43
Francois Mergen, the Dean of the College [Forestry] at Yale at the time, and man,
20:49
he got on the phone, and was vitriolic.
20:50
Oh shit.
20:50
Didn’t I know what the fuck of a big mistake I was making?
20:50
He
20:56
had this heavy French accent and wasn’t exactly saying it that way, but
21:05
that was the essence of it.
21:05
[Laughter] He was going to give me 24 hours to reconsider, and he wasn’t giving
21:11
that to many people, but was going to make an exception in my case, because I
21:11
was George Woodwell’s research associate, and George was on their faculty,
21:16
so, he was going to cut me a break.
21:19
But don’t fuck up again!
21:20
[Laughter]
21:22
So, I went and sat down with George, told him the situation.
21:25
He said, “You should go to Yale.
21:31
But, I can understand why you don’t want to.” And they were right, of course.
21:39
They were absolutely right.
21:41
[Laughter] But, I think that probably, for my own mental health, I did the right
21:51
thing.
21:57
You’ve probably heard a similar kind of thing, how grad school decisions
21:57
have been made, and you get knocked all around from point A to point B.
21:57
You don’t have enough time for mine.
21:58
I went to eight different schools.
22:03
[Laughter]
22:07
Working at Brookhaven with George had given me the opportunity
22:11
to spend a lot of time at Yale, using the library resources there.
22:14
I had realized that was a wonderful intellectual
22:21
climate it really was.
22:21
And it wasn’t a case where I didn’t know what that environment was.
22:35
I certainly did, so I knew what I was walking away from.
22:35
It’s kind of interesting that Wisconsin, when you’re from Vermont,
22:37
and the winters in Wisconsin can’t be any worse than they are in Vermont.
22:41
I don’t know, it was a quirky thing.
22:44
We didn’t gel.
22:45
We were married for about 10 years, and I think probably both of us knew by the end
22:51
of the second year this was a big mistake.
22:54
But we tried to make it work.
23:00
Hmmm.
23:02
Wisconsin at that time had the Wisconsin Alumni Research Fund.
23:06
They still do.
23:07
It doesn’t make as much money as it
23:11
did then.
23:11
Moneys for that came from the rat poison WARF room, which is the acronym
23:14
for Wisconsin Alumni Research Fund.
23:18
Scientists there produced rat poison, and all the moneys from the sale
23:22
of that, well, not all, went to supply dollars to graduate students.
23:28
I mean, they were high rollers.
23:35
That was a fat one.
23:36
So, your background in pesticide studies would be attractive, I suppose, there?
23:40
Oh, I think that they were – [laughing].
23:42
It was awarded on a competitive basis to promising grad students, regardless
23:49
of discipline in the department.
23:53
Yeah.
23:55
I attribute a lot of my success in that competition
24:01
to Jim
24:04
Boyle.
24:04
I was really fortunate to have worked with and be associated with
24:10
good people, with lots of admirable qualities and considerable integrity.
24:14
Did you have long-term career goals at that point?
24:19
Where you wanting to be in like 10 years?
24:20
Yep!
24:21
Sure did.
24:23
They’re funny when I look back at them today.
24:25
I wanted to be, if not an Ivy League school tenure-track position, or
24:31
at least a school where I could move into a tenure-track position.
24:35
Someplace close to
24:38
the family, where my roots were.
24:41
So, you were looking pretty strongly along academic lines then?
24:46
Yes.
24:47
I felt that
24:50
that’s where I wanted to be.
24:51
Hmm.
24:52
And the atmosphere there at Brookhaven was definitely one of
25:00
fostering that.
25:02
I felt real comfortable there.
25:03
Hmm.
25:06
They had a good library.
25:09
It was a place to really be in an ivory tower, an intellectually-committed
25:13
star, if you wanted it to be.
25:14
It was a great environment for that.
25:16
Any tradition of that in your family?
25:17
Not really.
25:26
My interest in forestry issues was because my mother’s side of the family
25:31
had nearly lost a fortune in lumber,
25:37
that ancestry.
25:39
My dad’s side of the family was largely dairy farmers and
25:42
cabinet-makers, and craftsmen.
25:47
And, good dairy farmers.
25:51
But there was in both sides of the family, a deep respect
25:56
for scholarship and education.
26:01
My grandmother McKee, who probably never even looked at anything
26:05
resembling a high school, was an avid reader who would just explore at
26:10
home,
26:13
so that was her
26:17
inquiry.
26:18
On the other side of my family there were
26:22
several people who worked in research libraries, and so, there
26:27
was that spin on it too.
26:29
Second cousin of mine.
26:33
So,
26:36
your plans got a little bit sidetracked when you came out?
26:38
Came out here and discovered all this public land.
26:47
I had been involved in group research a little bit at Brookhaven because George
26:58
Ruhl collaborated with a lot of people, and was involved in projects.
27:00
Many projects that had 2 and 3 collaborators, you know, 2 or 3
27:00
different people, and he had his hands active in a lot of different
27:03
projects, and as people worked with him.
27:05
I similarly engaged in a variety of things.
27:10
My last year there, I was looking at pesticides, studying succession in old
27:13
fields, and looking at nutrient-cycling in
27:19
environmentally-stressed
27:22
situations.
27:23
Pesticides, radiation stress, thermal stress,
27:30
possibly.
27:30
That was typical of the way George worked.
27:33
So, I got through grad school and landed here.
27:37
Here’s this multidisciplinary program, and a couple of dozen different people.
27:46
It was like being a kid in a candy store.
27:48
There
27:52
were all kinds of neat things going on.
27:52
And the people here, oh, there were moments when things didn’t work together.
27:56
But basically, people worked together extremely well.
28:00
So,
28:03
when I travelled around and tried to find other places that are like this,
28:06
in pieces of geography where I thought I might like living, Colorado Rockies,
28:12
New England, I couldn’t find it.
28:15
Hmm.
28:16
So, it’s an unusual environment in the way people took time to
28:22
listen to their colleagues in other disciplines, and seemed to respect
28:31
their boundaries, but not be afraid to offer suggestions in their area, too.
28:35
It
28:39
was just a very healthy intellectual environment.
28:44
A real good one.
28:44
I liked it.
28:45
And I liked the Northwest.
28:47
I mean I liked the Willamette Valley winters,
28:55
but the rest of it, I didn’t get.
28:56
What was your first impression when you came here?
29:00
What about the place struck you?
29:03
Ah, well
29:05
- The Andrews in particular, but the region in general.
29:09
I
29:13
drove the southern route, and there was heavy snow from central Nevada
29:21
all the way north, and I didn’t see a tree very clearly until the crest of the
29:29
Willamette Pass, and for a balance of halfway up the pass down to Oakridge,
29:34
I was driving through blinding snow.
29:39
This was 10-miles-an-hour kind of driving.
29:44
When the snow stopped, I looked up at these old-growth Douglas-fir.
29:49
That corridor used to be lined with beautiful Douglas-fir.
29:52
I just pulled over and I went [gasping] , “Do you believe this?” I had
30:02
sons at the time that were
30:05
like 7 and 4, no,
30:11
they were 6 and 3, and they were asleep. I woke them up, saying, “Come on out,”
30:18
I was so jazzed by these huge trees.
30:21
And they were all laden with snow.
30:24
It was just absolutely gorgeous.
30:28
I said, “We’re going to be around things like this. This is great.”
30:32
That was my first impression.
30:35
My other travels through the Northwest had been touch-and-go;
30:38
Seattle airport on my way to Alaska.
30:41
And the Alaska forests are majestic and beautiful, and
30:44
that wilderness is incomparable.
30:45
Hmm.
30:47
But this was a wonderful,
30:52
phew, revelation!
30:52
It’s like being blindfolded,
31:00
and then suddenly having to take the blindfold off.
31:00
Then, an hour later, or more, a little more than that, driving into
31:05
Blue River, which was where I was supposed to live when I first came
31:12
out here.
31:12
I had been given directions,
31:18
but because of the snow, I was running about 8 hours late.
31:22
We got there at about 11 o’clock [pm] instead of the middle of the afternoon.
31:27
I called, and the guy said, “Instead of going to the office to meet, why
31:34
don’t you just come by my house.” He gave me directions to his house. But
31:39
I drove past the office, and here’s this little shit-hole of an office
31:44
that was the old ranger station
31:47
at the time, and I went, “Uhhhh.
31:48
[Laughing]
31:51
Whoa, this is really minimal.
31:51
This is really, really minimal.”
31:58
Let’s see, we’ve got a program with roughly two dozen people, I had been
32:02
given a copy of the proposal in the mail.
32:06
I knew the scope of the program.
32:08
I just thought, no way it could operate out of what was there.
32:13
And so, I was thinking mobile home, these modular homes, but try to plan a
32:20
research facility in that 50-minute drive from the office to where this guy lived.
32:28
The first thing I said when I get out was, “Well, I drove past the offices.
32:35
Not much, is it?” He said, “No...no...” With
32:40
the scope of the program what it is, we’ve got to start thinking about how
32:44
were going to accommodate these people.
32:48
That was a big program, big ideas, and zero facilities to work out of.
32:54
That was
32:57
in the first hour of my being in the McKenzie Valley.
33:01
What were your responsibilities at that point?
33:03
I was hired as a
33:09
scientist in the field
33:12
to try and coordinate the research activity.
33:15
Hmmm.
33:18
But also do a lot of hands-on science.
33:23
Most properly it would be described as sort of a “super-technician”
33:25
position, where people already had these ideas, and I was to
33:36
organize myself and other technicians to collect the numbers.
33:39
As of that point, I had no intellectual investment in the program.
33:53
Because of the variety of tasks, and initially, the relatively menial nature of
33:59
many of those tasks, it would be glossing it to call it a post-doctoral position.
34:05
But this wonderful group,
34:10
within a month, a day-and-a-half or two days a week, were basically mine, to work
34:18
on my own and on what I wanted to work on.
34:21
Hmm.
34:22
Very quickly it became more professional, but initially, it was
34:26
organizing myself and other technicians to collect a lot of field data.
34:31
So, facilities were an immediate concern then?
34:33
Oh, yeah.
34:36
I knew we weren’t going to be able to mount the kind of program they were
34:39
looking for without initial facilities.
34:42
So, we bought one trailer one year, one trailer the next, put up a warehouse
34:48
to house things at the site, and got
34:52
a couple of camper trailers
34:55
on extended rental for people to work out of in the field.
35:01
Bought a shit-load of camping gear so that people could work out of tents.
35:08
Designated a campground there on the forest.
35:11
Pissed everybody off with that.
35:13
Just because they wanted to camp other places?
35:18
No, the Forest Service woke up one day and suddenly there was this
35:23
de facto camp ground on the experimental forest.
35:25
Oh.
35:26
So,
35:31
we had port-a-potties brought in.
35:34
We’d nailed a couple of planks between some wind-throw trees
35:41
and put up a toilet seat, and people sat on that and crapped into the big hole
35:44
into the blow-down between the trees.
35:46
It was very informal.
35:49
[Laughter] People loved the openness, actually, and most of them loved it a lot.
35:55
Had some very creative kitchens, two in particular that
36:00
capitalized on these wind-throws.
36:02
The root-wad of the wind-throws made shelves for things to be stacked on.
36:08
Okay.
36:08
And there were tarps spread out.
36:12
It was primitive.
36:12
There was a lot of logistical stuff early on.
36:17
What
36:20
kinds of projects were you involved in?
36:21
You were doing some research yourself?
36:24
The one I focused on was
36:31
mapping permanent vegetation plots, so we could track changes
36:34
in vegetation through time.
36:38
There were successional studies of vegetation with these, but the
36:43
generic aspect of plots had several different aspects to them.
36:50
Looking at the timing of different kinds of biological events in different
36:57
species of plants, timing of leaf-out, timing of flowering, timing of fruit
37:01
sap and fruit dispersal, and leaf fall,
37:08
under a general topic called phenology.
37:10
P-h-e-n-o-l-o-g-y.
37:18
Then, I was involved in the nutrient cycling aspects on these
37:20
watersheds, and moisture-use and some moisture draw-down patterns.
37:28
There were
37:31
timing and transpiration from these forests to measure.
37:37
Then wherever else needed help.
37:39
I mean, that was the other “duties-as-assigned kind-of-category.”
37:43
One week, I might be doing some surveying,
37:48
as they discovered I had a background in land-surveying, so I found
37:52
myself heading a surveying crew.
38:01
Hmm.
38:01
Umm.
38:02
You mentioned that Ted Dyrness and Jerry Franklin had brought you along and brought
38:06
you up to speed when you got there?
38:09
Ted, Jerry, and I, early on, went out for a walk in the forest.
38:16
Actually, we were picking a site to put in some plots.
38:21
We
38:23
had
38:27
two or three very fine days this one particular week,
38:30
early in my tenure out here.
38:35
Those two seemed to have a
38:41
very
38:43
positive, very, very healthy professional relationship, at the time.
38:51
Jerry was a plant ecologist, and also a good soil scientist.
38:57
Ted was a soil scientist, and also a good plant ecologist.
39:01
They
39:04
came at it from slightly different disciplines, if you will,
39:04
from two different directions.
39:11
Both were extremely well-read, solid,
39:16
and Jerry was quick to speculate, while Ted is much more cautious.
39:22
You can imagine how that kind of difference in personality might
39:29
play out in the field with a third-party present that’s willing to
39:34
kind of “goose” one or the other, to
39:40
get that interaction going, interaction running.
39:44
So, it was a lot of fun to say, “Jerry thinks this is the case,”
39:49
and, “Ted, what do you think?” Ted would be so reluctant to speculate.
39:52
He’d say, “We don’t have enough information to say, but …,” and
39:56
he’d be forced into it.
39:59
Jerry would react to Ted’s conservativism.
40:02
It was a lot of fun.
40:02
But they also had worked out here a lot, and it was a crash-course
40:09
in northwestern forest ecosystems.
40:11
It was great.
40:14
And it ended up with Jerry getting us royally-stuck in a mud hole
40:22
on a road way up in the woods.
40:23
We had to walk out,
40:26
with Ted pissing and moaning about the fact that Jerry got us stuck.
40:29
[Laughter] Let’s see, it was a fun day.
40:35
We got a ride quickly, and got down to get a truck that could pull
40:42
us out.
40:42
There was almost something symbolic about the fact Jerry was extending himself so
40:47
much, trying to get to a place where I had been told that morning that the road
40:52
wasn’t open because of snow, just another 1/2 mile beyond where Jerry got stuck.
40:58
We’d been told that we should be wary of this one spot where the hillside
41:02
had slid off and had this huge puddle.
41:06
Jerry just wanted to test it anyway.
41:09
[Laughter] Man, we were in so deep.
41:13
Couldn’t open the doors on one side, we were in
41:19
so deep.
41:19
It was a good time.
41:20
[Laughter] They were good people
41:28
to work with and for.
41:29
One of the wonderful things about Jerry’s personality is
41:36
that he makes everybody feel welcome and important.
41:39
I mean, everybody’s making a significant contribution.
41:40
Jerry’s a wonderful cheerleader, you know, “It’s good to hear that.”
41:44
You were familiar with his work before that, but had you met him before?
41:47
I was very impressed by this thing we talked about.
41:53
I had
41:56
seen an early draft of this
42:01
book that came out in paperback in 1970 [Natural Vegetation of Oregon and
42:05
Washington, Franklin & Dyrness] . This was revised a couple of years later.
42:07
I see that my earlier version is gone.
42:12
There is
42:19
not another place in the country that has anything like this,
42:19
and these guys bootlegged this, did it, despite their boss.
42:21
Ted mentioned he had supervisors that were supportive of that, if
42:26
it didn’t suck up too much time.
42:31
I was familiar with Ted’s work more than Jerry’s.
42:34
Jerry had not, at that point, published much.
42:37
Jerry’s work was pretty “fluffy” and unfocused, and Ted, in contrast,
42:44
had done really significant soils and vegetation work that was
42:47
very state-of-the-art quality.
42:52
Really topnotch.
42:52
Hmm.
42:56
Ted was one of the people I had written to, Jerry too.
43:01
I was aware of him too.
43:02
Uh-huh.
43:03
Because of that particular work.
43:10
So yeah,
43:13
I was impressed by their work.
43:15
What was it that put yourself back in that time frame, as of 1973?
43:21
What was your perception of what an experimental forest should
43:24
be for, or should be doing,
43:31
at that time?
43:31
I don’t think I can do that very honestly.
43:32
It would be really-colored.
43:42
When I came out here, I had no intention of being here 25 years.
43:45
Yeah.
43:45
I viewed, and still do view, the
43:50
whole landscape as a place to be researched.
43:53
If that
43:57
turns out to be any place, the landscape is bound to be researched.
44:00
That’s where conditions are best met.
44:04
But I also was very appreciative of the fact that it was important to have sites
44:12
specifically designated for research.
44:15
I experienced the Arctic, and it taught me that if you didn’t have some places that
44:18
were really designated for research, they would get trashed, and years of valuable
44:23
research goes down the tube, and is lost.
44:26
So, designated sights are important.
44:29
Where were you working out of?
44:31
Near Barrow.
44:33
Okay.
44:33
South of Barrow on the North Slope.
44:36
This was all pretty influenced by the pipeline.
44:38
You’re
44:43
looking at how plant communities were distributed along the environmental
44:48
gradient found up in that part of the world, where, over hundreds of
44:54
square miles, you might have four feet
45:08
of
45:13
relief.
45:21
Uh-huh.
45:23
Real flat.
45:23
I’m a little fuzzy on
46:06
the dates here.
46:07
But, was that about the time that Project Chariot was under way up there?
46:10
This was post-Chariot.
46:13
[Project proposed by U.S. Atomic Energy Commission to explode nuclear
46:15
weapons to create deep harbor on Alaska’s north shore/Arctic Ocean]
46:16
Okay.
46:17
This was ‘65, ’66, and Project Chariot was from ‘59 to ’62, something like that.
46:22
Somewhere in there.
46:23
Okay.
46:23
I used to have a Project Chariot compendium here, but it must be behind
46:30
you somewhere, a big black book.
46:35
We interacted with some of the Project Chariot people who were still
46:39
out there on post-Chariot stuff,
46:45
and flew down to
46:49
where Project Plowshare [U.S. government program using nuclear weapons for
46:50
construction purposes – 27 locales] was supposed to occur, and saw that part of
46:57
the world.
46:57
It was great.
46:58
Oh, god, in my sort of perfect world, I would be spending summers
47:02
up there, and winters in the northern Rockies, but at any rate,
47:10
[laughter], that’s beautiful country.
47:12
Wild-ass country.
47:14
Damn.
47:14
You’re probably a little bit fuzzy on what you were thinking about in terms
47:19
of experimental forests in that period?
47:21
Well, I didn’t view it as something I was going to try and
47:24
build a career on, by any means.
47:26
Nor did I
47:29
view that as part of an assembly of lands designated for research purposes.
47:38
Uh-huh.
47:39
These “Research Natural Areas” are important. Experimental forests
47:43
are important. Experimental ranges and national laboratories
47:48
like Oak Ridge, that’s another government lab, those are important.
47:52
National parks.
47:53
All of them I view as important as research sites.
47:57
Each has infrastructure, and there ought to be some kind of flexible vision as
48:10
to what these things are for, but they’re all important.
48:11
If you hunker down too much in those, to the exclusion of going outside of
48:14
those pieces of real estate, you have no idea how representative any of it is.
48:20
So, one of the things that fries my ass, that we get criticized about at times,
48:27
is how provincial we are, those of us
48:32
that work at the Andrews.
48:34
You take any one of the people that work out there, they
48:34
also work in the Coast Range,
48:40
way up in the hills, Olympic Peninsula, eastern Oregon, northern
48:41
California, Peru, Chile, China;
48:46
they
48:49
aren’t provincial people.
48:49
That’s an inappropriate focus
48:59
of criticism, I think.
48:59
Ted was telling me yesterday he never considered himself to be really
49:02
scientist material, and he kind of put Jerry in the same category.
49:06
What I think he meant by that, the kind of standard stereotypical
49:10
view of the scientist, who is detailed-oriented and things like that.
49:16
I don’t know if you have a reaction to that.
49:18
Neither one of them are detail freaks.
49:19
That’s why they are such good scientists.
49:22
They’re synthesizers.
49:24
They’re able to see patterns where others get lost in the detail.
49:29
Huh?
49:31
I guess that’d be my first reaction.
49:34
My understanding
49:37
of your role, at the time you came there was to coordinate the administration
49:40
of the details, to get those ideas and get the right people in there.
49:44
Right.
49:45
Try to find technicians that matched.
49:51
Somebody was talking today about hiring, and
49:55
I was reflecting back on it.
49:58
I was frequently asked to find technicians for various people for projects, as sort
50:04
of a clearinghouse for summer hires.
50:07
I believed that.
50:09
I felt it was more appropriate for me to know what scientists were doing,
50:15
to get a better idea as to what they really wanted in terms of skills.
50:20
But I did it only a few times where it was in the black.
50:25
I needed to know more.
50:26
It’s kind of a crap-shoot
50:35
when someone is hired, anyway.
50:35
To invest the time to interview them to be sure.
50:35
You came in about the time the IBP [International Biological
50:36
Program] was taking off.
50:37
Right?
50:37
I was the first hire in IBP.
50:39
Oh, you were the first one.
50:40
Yeah.
50:42
Then, there was a major infusion on from that point.
50:46
I didn’t hold the purse strings, per se, but it was clear to me that I
50:51
should feel free to make suggestions as to how moneys were invested.
50:57
I didn’t have budgets under my control, but I certainly was able to direct
51:00
funds in a lot of different ways.
51:01
Uh-huh.
51:04
I hate snowmobiles, and I said we needed one to get around out here.
51:07
And we
51:11
had snowmobiles.
51:12
Snowmobiles aren’t my favorite.
51:14
They didn’t prove to be adequate, but, if I had to bite the bullet
51:18
with snowmobiles, then, I’d do it.
51:22
But they just couldn’t hack it, to get us through this winter stuff [heavy,
51:24
wet snow] . Get a snow-cat up here [better suited for conditions and
51:27
purposes] , but there wasn’t money.
51:28
Uh-huh.
51:29
To say these moneys will go for that Snow-cat, those were
51:32
Jerry’s responsibilities, plainly.
51:33
But, I felt like I
51:41
had a lot of input into that.
51:41
With the IBP starting up, there’s a whole new set of responsibilities for
51:45
the scientists on the forest out there.
51:48
Did you get a sense that there was any kind of coordinated strategy to deal
51:51
with those by the time you arrived?
51:53
Yes.
51:53
There were a couple of different ways.
51:56
The
51:59
proposal presented a structure
52:05
where people work on different aspects geared towards a general
52:11
understanding of how the forest
52:14
ticks.
52:14
This was an old way of thinking about what a general model ought to do.
52:20
To a large extent,
52:26
the plan was to coordinate research activities to provide information to
52:30
build a huge forest ecology model.
52:34
A fellow named Scott Overton was the general modeler on that early project.
52:43
Scott was too theoretically-oriented for Jerry’s taste,
52:50
and
52:52
Jerry wanted some quick victories in terms of publications that
53:00
gave information on particular aspects of the system, sort of like “bing,
53:03
bing, bing.” And Scott’s approach was slower, more broad-based, broad-footed.
53:12
This is my personal interpretation.
53:14
Huh-huh.
53:14
It didn’t mesh well with Jerry’s need to get stuff out quickly.
53:19
Hmm.
53:21
And so, was a general systems-approach fragmented into many small approaches,
53:29
and people like Phil Sollins and Mary Strand were brought on to model
53:36
different populations of insects or nutrient flows in the watershed.
53:42
Things that were trackable, doable, and you could get a publication out of.
53:45
Uh-huh.
53:47
So, Scott went his separate way.
53:49
He produced a body of modeling theory,
53:57
which
54:01
dealt with hierarchical structures of models, and hierarchical modeling.
54:01
It was a full 15 years ahead of its time.
54:01
Hmm.
54:01
It was the basis for a
54:11
lot of high-profile, hierarchical-modeling work that came out in the
54:16
mid-eighties, a full 15 years ahead of others, and based on Scott
54:20
knowing concepts and how to structure
54:24
these things.
54:24
That’s
54:25
-- ? I hope the tape’s not running.
54:27
[Laughing] We’re revisiting that kind of structure now, 20 to 25 years
54:34
after Scott came up with it, and finding it conceptually very useful.
54:39
Hmm.
54:42
But, the animosity between Scott and Jerry left a cloud.
54:49
We can’t call him on the activities.
54:51
So, I don’t feel free to call these modeling activities
54:55
by the names Scott used.
54:58
I have to talk about them in terms of hierarchical models, and
55:01
not use terms that Scott used.
55:02
Hmm.
55:03
So, there’s still some weird, strange bad blood, there.
55:08
You developed those theories after he left the group, or is
55:11
this a product he was working on?
55:11
They were in development.
55:13
He talked about them.
55:14
One of the first seminars I sat in on when I got here, he was presenting
55:19
how a general systems model could be constructed where you compartmentalize
55:28
the processes and have them operating at different time frames, and providing
55:32
input to the model at a higher level.
55:34
Hmm.
55:35
And then, that higher level model might interrogate another model,
55:40
ask it what its condition was, or what the rate of something was.
55:46
These things [component sub-models] could be nested in a
55:49
way that would allow them to talk among themselves, ask questions, ask
55:54
what are the rates or states within that particular sub-compartment, and
56:03
what we were getting out of it.
56:03
What kinds of computer systems were available to do that?
56:05
Those were old, clunky things.
56:07
You know, there’s more power in this right here [tapping a PC] than in
56:10
the mainframe that was on campus.
56:12
Were you using the OSU campus computer?
56:14
Yeah, we were using punch cards, and it was a nightmarish thing to run
56:27
that
56:31
thing.
56:31
Yeah, it was a nightmarish thing to run that.
56:31
When you have those kinds of administrative issues, you need to
56:35
hire someone to fill a particular slot or a niche, or replace
56:38
somebody who leaves for some reason, how was that decision managed?
56:42
Is there a group?
56:43
There is a group, yeah.
56:45
The spirit of the program has been one of consensus since I arrived.
56:50
Now sometimes it was faulty in that Jerry would cleverly give people
56:56
the feeling that we were coming to a consensus, and then we would go with
56:59
a decision that he had already made.
57:02
And sometimes it was transparent.
57:05
But there were times when Jerry would say, “Well, you gotta get on their case for
57:11
doing this while I’m gone. Go this way.”
57:17
Sometimes a majority would be ignored.
57:22
And that caused some heartburn and there were several people who left
57:26
the group due to that over the years.
57:31
People like Mike Newton, Scott Overton,
57:37
Denny Lavender.
57:41
But they were not people who have shown any ability to work in group
57:46
research, other than with one other person, since then anyway.
57:53
They tended to be lone rangers, more typical
58:03
of academia, and the reward structure still tends to reward that type of
58:07
behavior more than group research.
58:07
It’s still hard to get recognition for
58:10
participation in group research.
58:12
We are on a campus which has given us relative freedom.
58:13
There are
58:16
some departments that don’t seem to
58:21
avoid doing that.
58:21
That’s probably something worth looking into.
58:23
You were saying earlier your long-term goal was an academic
58:26
position at some point.
58:29
You became involved here at OSU after ’71, but what kinds of involvement
58:36
did you have at the university in the early ‘70s, if anything?
58:39
All employment initially, in
58:45
the money department [tape ends].
58:46
Then, the position got me involved with the College of Forestry [OSU]
58:54
. Those were term appointments,
58:59
and
59:02
when those ended, I
59:08
got another series of term appointments
59:14
working for federal agencies, or filling in for people on
59:18
sabbatical here on campus.
59:22
That went on for about three years, I think.
59:28
Jerry had gone off to the National Science Foundation as a program officer there.
59:33
He returned, I talked with him a few times about my
59:40
desires to stay in the Northwest.
59:42
I was going through a divorce, wanted to stay near my children, and
59:49
he had an idea of creating a
59:52
thing like we have today.
59:54
He had seen some opportunities at the National Science Foundation
59:58
he felt we should capitalize on,
1:00:06
but he was going to need some help to do that.
1:00:07
Would I want to help him with the proposal?
1:00:13
I
1:00:15
said sure, and basically wrote a
1:00:19
proposal to create the job I have.
1:00:20
Okay.
1:00:24
That was to establish the Andrews as a National Field Research Facility,
1:00:28
alias “Experimental Ecological Reserve.”
1:00:34
[EER] It was clear in Jerry’s mind the stage was set for something to happen
1:00:39
in the near future at NSF, to create
1:00:46
what eventually became the Long-Term Ecological Research [LTER] program.
1:00:49
Hmm.
1:00:51
So, he and I worked very closely in that initial proposal,
1:00:58
to structure both the Andrews
1:01:02
research program and structure the administration of that research
1:01:09
program that would be both an example for NSF and
1:01:22
the program approach as to how things might evolve.
1:01:27
We would be well positioned to be extremely competitive.
1:01:35
Word was
1:01:40
that the National Science Foundation wanted this [process]
1:01:41
to start sometime in 1976.
1:01:42
Hmm.
1:01:42
Sometime in the next 3, 5, 6 years, they wanted to establish a program that
1:01:49
would allow ecosystem studies to be conducted over long periods of time.
1:01:57
Our group here was well positioned to offer advice on
1:02:03
that.
1:02:04
Many of us participated in a series of planning workshops.
1:02:08
This
1:02:11
eventually evolved into the
1:02:25
LTER program.
1:02:26
Here’s a folder which was part of the first conference
1:02:38
[McKee shows Geier literature]
1:02:40
. Hmm.
1:02:41
Here’s another copy of
1:02:45
it.
1:02:45
Do you have a spare copy of this that I can borrow for a while?
1:02:48
Yeah, you sure can.
1:02:48
Why don’t you take the one that’s not falling apart?
1:02:50
And you might be interested in
1:03:00
this
1:03:03
as well.
1:03:03
There’s a series of four, actually, I think.
1:03:05
Hmm.
1:03:10
This one’s got a map in case
1:03:18
the
1:03:21
other does not.
1:03:21
[Flipping through files.] Maybe there are five.
1:03:23
I forget how many I went to.
1:03:29
The first one’s in ‘77.
1:03:31
There’s a ‘77, ‘78, ‘79, over a three-year period.
1:03:40
This one’s in ‘82.
1:03:41
This is LTER-dated, but
1:03:51
these were all precursors to the request for proposals for Long-Term
1:03:55
Ecological Research program.
1:04:03
Hmm.
1:04:04
I don’t know if they have rosters in all of these or not.
1:04:07
Hmm.
1:04:07
They’d be at the back I think.
1:04:19
Check off people from our group who participated.
1:04:27
Well, Paul Risser, who’s
1:04:34
now our president [OSU] , was there.
1:04:35
Huh.
1:04:48
Could’ve sworn I was there on this one, too, because I was staying with George.
1:04:53
Where was the second one?
1:04:54
Well,
1:05:05
I wasn’t at the second one.
1:05:13
I guess it was the first one.
1:05:14
Hmm.
1:05:17
You
1:05:24
get down to some nitty-gritty in these subsequent workshops.
1:05:39
George Woodwell was somebody you’d worked with before?
1:05:42
Yeah, George was there.
1:05:46
I
1:05:54
guess I went to three of the four of them.
1:05:54
I was thinking I was at
1:06:09
every one of them.
1:06:18
You mentioned there was a good climate at OSU for cooperative work.
1:06:23
Is this something you had been aware of before you came here,
1:06:25
or was that kind of news to you?
1:06:26
Well, Jerry Franklin’s most productive work had been built on a
1:06:34
collaborative effort.
1:06:35
There were always one or two other participants.
1:06:38
When I was at Georgia,
1:06:42
my major professor was involved with the IBP program on the east coast, for
1:06:47
the Eastern Deciduous Forest Biome.
1:06:50
I was peripheral to that, I wasn’t part of that mainstream.
1:06:55
I saw what was going on there, and the group there worked well
1:07:02
together, but nothing like the group worked when I got here.
1:07:08
Hmm.
1:07:09
A much more coherent team than what had been back east.
1:07:11
The model being used there was collaborative research involved in getting
1:07:17
people together who would determine ahead of time where their boundaries
1:07:22
were, what their responsibilities were, they went their separate ways, then
1:07:26
reported back once a year with data or
1:07:31
a product.
1:07:33
Uh-huh.
1:07:35
Whereas here, they were having monthly meetings, and there was a lot of
1:07:39
“shucking and jiving.” I didn’t know anything about the aquatic research
1:07:45
program when I arrived, and when I read the proposal, I found myself, along
1:07:49
with many others outside of the aquatic research program, volunteering to help
1:07:53
people in that, during storms that first winter. Because they just didn’t
1:07:58
have the manpower to do it otherwise.
1:08:00
Hmm.
1:08:01
There was that kind of “one hand washing the other” community
1:08:07
that I just hadn’t experienced.
1:08:11
To me, it was healthy, professional, and it was great to be a part
1:08:15
of a community like this.
1:08:16
Uh-huh.
1:08:17
The other neat spin
1:08:23
was, in addition to the sense of community and sense of wanting to do
1:08:27
good science, that it was relevant to natural resource management.
1:08:36
At least part of my background had been
1:08:42
related
1:08:55
to forest management.
1:08:56
My
1:09:02
family had a lumber business and lots of land holdings.
1:09:08
I like that practical aspect.
1:09:10
A lot of others do too.
1:09:15
I think because of people like Ted and Jerry, they want field
1:09:22
research to be relevant--
1:09:23
Uh-huh.
1:09:25
-- to natural
1:09:28
resource managers.
1:09:29
From the very outset, there
1:09:39
was a sense of community.
1:09:40
We’d give periodic updates, and invite people to seminars.
1:09:40
And it wasn’t an active attempt to be made leader, but to make
1:09:44
them fully-fledged members of the
1:09:50
community.
1:09:51
The door was open, invitations were extended, and then people were
1:09:57
also prone to say, well, this is an interesting piece of information.
1:10:03
Wouldn’t it be neat to do this with it?
1:10:05
Or, wouldn’t you like try to apply it in this manner?
1:10:08
Or, you realize what this means, don’t you?
1:10:11
If we keep this up, then such-and-such is going to start unraveling out there.
1:10:19
That’s quite different than
1:10:26
the attitude I’d been exposed to
1:10:33
by some of the people I had
1:10:38
listened to
1:10:41
while working at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.
1:10:48
My exposure with scientists up to that point-in-time was either, they’re
1:10:51
totally nuts-and-bolts oriented, like how many trees do you leave per acre to
1:10:54
get a production of a certain amount?
1:10:57
All empirically-derived, not based on any knowledge of how the system works, but
1:11:00
let’s just test these different levels, and leave them and see what happens.
1:11:06
Or it was, well, I’m not interested in telling people what I’ve learned,
1:11:13
or, esoteric publications that
1:11:19
I expect to promote me up the [science] career ladder.
1:11:21
Hmm.
1:11:26
I interviewed for a job in the early in the ‘80s at the University of Colorado,
1:11:32
in the Department of Environmental Population and Evolutionary Biology.
1:11:41
I actually offended the department head by saying one of the
1:11:47
things I enjoyed about my work where I was now, was that much of it was
1:11:55
directly-applied.
1:11:55
And
1:11:58
how many of our graduate students here would like that.
1:12:00
He was very quick to point out that was all well and good, but at his
1:12:05
institution the students worked on questions and not on how it applied.
1:12:12
We’re not here
1:12:27
to worry about how it affects forest management.
1:12:28
You said that there were open monthly meetings beginning
1:12:31
when you first got here.
1:12:33
Were those open meetings for everybody?
1:12:34
They were open to the community of people working at the Andrews Forest, those to
1:12:41
be working on the Coniferous Forest Biome project, and their graduate students,
1:12:47
post-docs, and others who want to come and sit in and listen to what’s going on.
1:12:53
Okay.
1:12:53
The way those used to be structured was, we would begin a seminar with
1:12:59
a 45-minute presentation, and we’d talk about research.
1:13:05
Then we start talking about that particular research
1:13:15
they’d presented, and then, we’d start talking about the overall program.
1:13:17
That would last for a brief period of time.
1:13:21
There
1:13:25
were almost always
1:13:29
inadequate amounts of time to do all the different things that needed to be done.
1:13:34
So, subcommittees would be formed to address it later in the day.
1:13:39
Hmm.
1:13:39
I was living on the river [upper McKenzie River valley] , and I’d come in
1:13:47
somewhere around 9:00 [a.m.] to whenever, maybe it was at noon-time.
1:13:48
I spent all afternoon here, and it was evening before I got home.
1:13:53
I think I started out a noon-time and then it was a long day, and
1:13:58
then it became an all-day affair.
1:14:03
Long
1:14:08
days sometimes.
1:14:08
I’m curious about the connection between this pattern of open meetings,
1:14:13
people committing themselves, their time, to meetings like that, and
1:14:21
this other point you made about the relative unconcern about what action
1:14:23
that was not necessarily producing a publication, not leading to tenure.
1:14:26
You don’t seem to worry about that too much.
1:14:32
A lot of the people who were principal at that point-in-history,
1:14:40
were people
1:14:49
who were already tenured.
1:14:50
There weren’t many
1:14:56
junior faculty members.
1:14:57
Some of those who were junior faculty members were in fact risking
1:15:03
their careers by investing so much time on some of these meetings.
1:15:04
Uh-huh.
1:15:04
At other institutions they would definitely be risking their careers.
1:15:09
But here, it wasn’t so
1:15:13
risky.
1:15:15
Can you think of any examples of people
1:15:18
like that?
1:15:19
Well,
1:15:21
Dick Waring would be an example of that.
1:15:22
Okay.
1:15:22
Dick did not have tenure at the beginning.
1:15:22
He became
1:15:26
tenured two or three years after
1:15:30
I was here.
1:15:33
He was in the department that was then called Forest Management.
1:15:38
He
1:15:43
agonized over whether he ought to stay with it.
1:15:45
And he chose to, and he got tenure.
1:15:48
Let’s see, Don Zobel
1:15:55
was in botany.
1:15:55
He was heavily involved, and he struggled.
1:15:59
Didn’t get tenure the first time he was up for it.
1:16:00
He had to wait a year.
1:16:00
Okay.
1:16:00
It was clear the reason he had to wait was because of his involvement with the group.
1:16:00
He had multiple-authored papers, and not a large number of those.
1:16:00
The department was unappreciative of the amount of effort necessary to produce
1:16:00
some of those pieces of research.
1:16:00
There are people who worked with us for a while,
1:16:03
as junior
1:16:38
faculty or post-docs, and then moved on, not especially
1:16:43
liking the environment here.
1:16:45
Hmm.
1:16:46
And,
1:16:49
feeling that group research was, it may be fun, but a little stifling
1:16:55
in terms of career options.
1:16:57
Okay.
1:17:02
Frank Triska, in the aquatic program, would be an example of that.
1:17:08
He went to the U.S. Geological Survey in San Francisco, where he thrived.
1:17:17
It sounds like the people who stuck around, with some exceptions, were
1:17:23
mostly already-tenured faculty members?
1:17:27
They had a safety net there.
1:17:30
They could take the time to participate in the amount of work
1:17:32
necessary to make a group effort
1:17:36
fly, and not be penalized.
1:17:39
Is there a connection there also, in terms of people who had a contingent of better
1:17:45
students that could do some of the work?
1:17:48
No.
1:17:48
Not necessarily.
1:17:49
Because there were faculty who had lots of graduate students,
1:17:54
and they chose to not participate.
1:17:56
Hmm.
1:17:59
The decision was made early on that we would not use money
1:18:06
to bring on graduate students.
1:18:07
We’d rather hire post-docs to do tasks, and summer technicians.
1:18:11
I
1:18:14
was an example, along with Jim Sedell, Fred Swanson, and Kermit Cromack.
1:18:24
I’m forgetting people now.
1:18:27
It was the prerogative with some of those people to do specific pieces of research,
1:18:33
working with summer hires, and there were not many graduate students.
1:18:37
There were a few, but considering the relative bulk of the program, there
1:18:44
were not many graduate students.
1:18:46
Other sites used
1:18:50
a lot of graduate students.
1:18:50
It sounds like a conscious decision to go to post-docs instead of graduate students?
1:18:53
Yes, it was.
1:18:54
What was the rationale for that,
1:18:57
the reasoning?
1:18:58
I think it was the product focus.
1:18:58
They weren’t sure if the graduate students would produce.
1:19:01
They wanted, basically, “proven stars.” Is that what you’re saying?
1:19:05
The
1:19:08
university [OSU] did not at that point have a lot of experience with
1:19:11
National Science Foundation awards.
1:19:12
The people that were involved, they were all pretty new to the process.
1:19:17
They were new to that kind of funding.
1:19:20
They were worried that they would not be able to stay competitive in that arena.
1:19:25
I
1:19:31
think, at least the things I picked up over the years,
1:19:34
these were the reasons why.
1:19:36
Okay.
1:19:36
They wanted to make sure that they did a really fine job on research at the outset.
1:19:41
Then they could spread their wings.
1:19:44
So, was it a university-level decision then?
1:19:47
No.
1:19:48
This was the people that turned in the proposal.
1:19:51
Okay.
1:19:52
It was not a university decision by any means.
1:19:57
The university was actually very upset that they did not use a
1:20:00
large number of graduate students.
1:20:01
Okay.
1:20:01
And at that time, we also were pretty flush with money.
1:20:06
We could bring on graduate students with other funding, state money.
1:20:10
The [OSU] Forest Research Lab ran a current budget that used to
1:20:13
allow for many graduate students.
1:20:14
Now it’s zero.
1:20:14
Hmm.
1:20:24
Sometimes I wonder why I stay, because, if you look back over the
1:20:27
history of state support, for forest research, it’s pretty abysmal.
1:20:34
Uh-huh.
1:20:35
And the university system state-wide is getting worse [funding-wise]
1:20:42
. So, you were getting, essentially, funding through the research
1:20:47
laboratory at the state level then, to do work on the Andrews?
1:20:50
Many of the graduate students working up there were hired with state money.
1:20:56
Hmm.
1:20:56
Most of the [OSU] College of Forestry faculty who were participating were
1:21:01
getting paid out of state money.
1:21:06
They weren’t getting as much of their time paid for by NSF as
1:21:10
they would actually have expected.
1:21:13
Some were getting dollars from their involvement with NSF,
1:21:22
and there were some state subsidies.
1:21:25
Is this before the formal memorandum of understanding?
1:21:28
[First MOU between OSU and the US Forest Service regarding the
1:21:29
HJA-EF, was signed in 1961.]
1:21:29
That was in 1970.
1:21:29
I was with Al Levno the other day talking about the changing of the
1:21:30
guard in terms of people working on
1:21:49
the Andrews from when IBP started in 1970.
1:21:53
Al pointed out that a younger contingent came out in the
1:21:58
early ‘70s, and he saw that
1:22:03
as qualitatively different in terms of how it related to the Blue River
1:22:06
District or the community of Blue River.
1:22:10
It’s an older group, and then, these younger scientists up there.
1:22:13
Does that sound right?
1:22:15
There was a
1:22:20
very small number of scientists prior to the beginning of this bigger program.
1:22:25
Most
1:22:28
of them had lived
1:22:33
for a short time on the district compound,
1:22:39
socialized with those people, were better known by the district people, and
1:22:47
then this program comes here.
1:22:50
We had to have a facility.
1:22:51
There’s no place to put them on the compound.
1:22:53
So,
1:22:56
we had a thing called the “Rainbow Ranch Adult Mobile Park.” That got a
1:23:05
lot of sparks going in the community.
1:23:11
[Laughter] The people that lived out of that particular facility rarely
1:23:17
interacted in the district movement.
1:23:20
University people didn’t have a history or tradition of
1:23:24
interacting with district people, so
1:23:28
that’s right.
1:23:28
It was a big change.
1:23:33
Preceding about 1970, when people are living closely together with the district,
1:23:41
Ted and Al said that there was a period of benign neglect.
1:23:43
There was not much attention being to what they were doing up there by the district,
1:23:47
and in some cases overt hostility.
1:23:50
Then
1:23:54
you start camping up on the site at the Andrews.
1:23:58
Isn’t that about the time when the closer connection begins to develop?
1:24:03
Yeah, it did.
1:24:03
But not so much at
1:24:07
the day-to-day operational level, as it was at the higher organizational levels.
1:24:12
Hmm.
1:24:16
I suspect the forest supervisor, in 1970 it was Zane Gray Smith,
1:24:22
could not have given me three names of scientists up there.
1:24:28
Five years later, the forest supervisor was Mike Kerrick, and I
1:24:33
bet he could give you a dozen names.
1:24:34
Hmm.
1:24:36
Probably more.
1:24:38
And he was more aware of what was going on than, damn, I forget
1:24:41
who was in there until then, but somebody was for a short time.
1:24:43
The connections were being made at a different level.
1:24:45
Okay.
1:24:45
And the information was flowing at different levels, the levels that are
1:25:02
probably more
1:25:06
productive to getting changes made faster.
1:25:10
If
1:25:12
you’re socializing with people marking trees, laying out pre-commercial
1:25:15
sales, and you tell them about your new research, they groove on it, but
1:25:18
then they have no way of putting into practice, other than bringing it up
1:25:21
at meetings, etc. If you persuade a forest supervisor he needs to do this
1:25:27
flood research, then it’ll get done.
1:25:29
I’m not trying to be too cynical about this, but it’s a more
1:25:35
effective level of tech transfer.
1:25:37
You have to work at a higher level of the national forest system, and
1:25:41
that’s when we began to try to improve communications with that group.
1:25:43
On a personal level, the kind of thing that Al was talking
1:25:43
about are things we don’t handle.
1:25:43
Uh-huh.
1:25:43
He’s still working on that.
1:25:43
Many people in a district, have converted to a bunch of new faces, and
1:26:03
many of the new people have no whiff of what we’re about up there.
1:26:08
They feel we’re a bunch of arrogant twits.
1:26:12
Well, “Whoa! Where did that come from?”
1:26:18
We say things to try and get them to
1:26:22
see us as real people.
1:26:25
That’s kind of a turning point you are at here.
1:26:26
That’s kind of similar to what happened in 1970 when you put up that new camp
1:26:28
up, and suddenly there’s a new presence.
1:26:31
Now there’s this permanent facility up there.
1:26:35
Permanent facility.
1:26:35
And there’s such a high turnover in the agency, that we’re losing contact.
1:26:40
Saturday morning there were
1:26:44
some Forest Service people who I happened to cross paths with up on
1:26:48
Andrews as I was headed out, and
1:26:53
I was commenting that I had interacted with this guy for about
1:27:01
15 years.
1:27:02
He was with another fellow who was pretty new, and he was giving him this line,
1:27:05
and, basically, he wasn’t buying it.
1:27:07
It was, “Well, that tree would have to be taken out in a salvage
1:27:13
sale.” I was filtering it based upon previous experience with this guy,
1:27:19
and I was kidding him about all this bullshit, and we could joke about
1:27:27
it.
1:27:27
We negotiated a few things there by the tailgate of his pickup truck.
1:27:33
I had seen the announcement that he was a couple years away
1:27:40
from retiring, and I said, “Geez, Bill, what am I going to do?” How
1:27:47
am I going to be able to negotiate, without you to answer questions
1:27:55
from young people coming in?
1:27:57
They’re
1:28:11
so constrained by what they perceive as proper protocol, that the kind
1:28:17
of interaction that Bill and I were doing, they don’t have any more.
1:28:22
It would take a whole lot more effort to accomplish
1:28:30
the
1:28:35
goals.
1:28:36
Less logging activity on the [Willamette] forest, less opportunities for day-to-day
1:28:40
interaction between the people doing research and the people who are
1:28:44
working for the national forest system.
1:28:47
There is this whole list of responsibilities that people
1:28:50
feel they have to observe.
1:28:52
We’d jolly well better
1:28:55
adjust, and, if we don’t, they turn their nose up at us.
1:29:01
Hmm.
1:29:01
At any rate, people have been there a long time, and that kind of sociology,
1:29:16
the social dynamics doesn’t apply.
1:29:21
This struck me that the social contacts that were going on earlier, the people
1:29:34
that they were talking with had much responsibility for what was done on
1:29:39
that part of the [Willamette] forest.
1:29:39
They were the ones implementing the policy, but the responsibility for
1:29:43
that policy was at a higher level.
1:30:02
Yeah.
1:30:02
You described how, through first the IBP and then later the LTER,
1:30:06
the Andrews Forest became sort of a prototype for the LTER.
1:30:11
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more on how it came to that status.
1:30:16
It was the proposal I mentioned earlier that we wrote in ’76, Jerry and I,
1:30:22
in anticipation of something like an LTER program coming down the pike.
1:30:27
We wanted to show it could be done and offer an example structure for
1:30:37
it.
1:30:37
One of the reasons we were so heavily involved in this series of meetings,
1:30:41
which you’ve got in your left hand [meeting reports] , was because of
1:30:44
that proposal and because it was successful, and because we had begun
1:30:49
to do LTER-like things with the funding
1:30:57
that came.
1:30:57
I have a couple of examples.
1:30:59
We
1:31:01
described both a local management committee as being a part of our
1:31:07
organizational structure, and we wanted a national review committee,
1:31:16
which would initially meet every year, then it went to every other
1:31:21
year.
1:31:22
We offered this as a model to make sure research that was being
1:31:26
done was addressing national as well as local needs or interests.
1:31:37
The
1:31:41
program, as it was developing,
1:31:46
would pertain to national needs, too.
1:31:53
Was it national in focus or programmatically?
1:31:57
One is national-focused, one is programmatic.
1:32:00
When the request for proposals went out for LTER sites, they were basically
1:32:00
called upon to organize themselves along those lines, to have a local
1:32:16
research management committee and to form a national advisory committee.
1:32:20
How about the evolution of the roles of the Andrews.
1:32:23
How did your responsibilities begin to change from 1970 to about 1980?
1:32:28
Well,
1:32:37
when I left the program, I was in essentially a post-doc at
1:32:41
that point of program in ‘74.
1:32:44
When I started again in ‘77, which was as the Director of the Andrews Forest, I
1:32:50
had greater responsibilities to develop the infrastructure and to promote a
1:32:59
program than what I’d had when I left.
1:33:01
When I left, it was a set of research objectives that I was responsible for
1:33:06
and coordinating help among all the different projects, then
1:33:12
making sure that people didn’t
1:33:15
step on each other’s toes or try to use the same piece of real-estate.
1:33:20
I still do that, but there was a greater leadership role.
1:33:28
Also, I had not been writing proposals to pay money prior to that.
1:33:33
It’s been a big chunk of my work to kind of focus operations.
1:33:39
I had written proposals, but it wasn’t so much of at the broad, programmatic
1:33:45
level, as for a specific set of projects.
1:33:50
You moved into that role because that’s about the time Franklin leaves.
1:33:53
Isn’t it?
1:33:54
Well, in ‘77, it was just that I was ready to do it.
1:34:05
Dick Waring was back in Hawaii, Jerry was taking the lead.
1:34:13
There was a need.
1:34:14
There were
1:34:18
plans to double our program, so we just needed somebody that could take the
1:34:22
lead in getting dollars to do this.
1:34:25
Jerry and some of the others were the best I had ever seen at coming
1:34:32
up with the money, and we complemented each other.
1:34:38
But, there was that change in responsibilities.
1:34:45
What are the strong points that you complemented each other with?
1:34:55
I think it would be better to
1:35:00
write your proposal before you present arguments as to the whys
1:35:03
about the things than Jerry does.
1:35:09
Hmm.
1:35:10
Better at rationalizing and creating an argument for facilities
1:35:16
and equipment than Jerry.
1:35:17
Jerry’s
1:35:19
won’t invest the time necessary.
1:35:21
It’s very hard to get bricks and mortar money.
1:35:21
Uh-huh.
1:35:21
So you have to persuade the reviewer that that’s really something that
1:35:22
NSF ought to be spending money on.
1:35:36
Okay.
1:35:37
I’ve done okay in that arena.
1:35:41
Jerry tends to do a good job at showing the elements of research to
1:35:49
application, of conventional resource management.
1:35:52
That’s probably his
1:35:56
strongest skill level.
1:35:59
I think both of us are about equally
1:36:03
balanced with Fred and Mark Harmon and
1:36:09
others, in pursuing why this this particular piece of research
1:36:12
is exciting and so germane.
1:36:14
Uh-huh.
1:36:15
Why it’s good science, we’re all pretty good at that part.
1:36:18
You need those different skills in preparing a proposal.
1:36:22
There
1:36:24
are different programs you compete for money and support, so you have
1:36:29
to use different kinds of skills.
1:36:30
What were your priorities on that forest up until the early 80s,
1:36:36
in that period of the early LTER
1:36:40
work?
1:36:40
Priorities, I don’t think they’ve changed much there.
1:36:42
Priorities have always been to invest the money into research
1:36:46
from your facility, and to
1:36:52
worry about research first, facilities and infrastructure,
1:37:00
second.
1:37:02
Structure the research program in a way that
1:37:08
doesn’t produce a lot of overlap, but produces a lot of work.
1:37:12
We have three groups that are working on the small mammals,
1:37:18
two groups doing aquatic research.
1:37:20
We have one group that does aquatic research, and they do it very well.
1:37:23
And we have one group that works with spotted owls, and population dynamics,
1:37:29
their prey species, and they do it very well, and one group that does physiology.
1:37:40
What’s your impression of things that tend to eat up money the fastest out there?
1:37:47
Well, facilities would be the biggest thing.
1:37:54
Sure.
1:37:54
I could give a fresh figure, our current budget on salaries.
1:37:56
That’s what would be the biggest, and then travel, instruments, sample preparation,
1:37:58
sample analysis costs, 30 percent maybe.
1:37:59
The rest for science.
1:38:09
Hmm.
1:38:13
You have to be
1:38:17
very sensitive to that, because you can get burned very quickly.
1:38:23
One of the things that we were dealing with was the Mount St. Helens
1:38:25
explosion, and some of the frenzy of activities that accompanied that.
1:38:26
What kind of an impact did that have on the group at the
1:38:29
Andrews from your perspective?
1:38:31
I don’t think it had much of an effect in
1:38:45
terms of production that was coming off the Andrews.
1:38:47
It had a tremendous effect in broadening our perspective as to
1:38:52
importance of certain aspects of
1:38:59
the system in terms of certain biological legacies.
1:39:02
The volcano really rubbed our nose in the importance of the plants and animals that
1:39:07
would be carried through a disturbance in re-establishing the ecosystem
1:39:12
and recovery processes and rates.
1:39:14
Hmm.
1:39:15
On that piece of real-estate.
1:39:16
And that was the single biggest lesson for that.
1:39:23
Uh-huh.
1:39:23
Many of us did not invest more than, say one month a year there.
1:39:31
Two weeks in the field and two weeks writing the stuff up.
1:39:33
So, it
1:39:36
wasn’t a huge drain at that time.
1:39:40
But it was a very interesting intellectual period.
1:39:44
A lot of
1:39:49
opportunities for what and how the different species behave under
1:39:53
severe disturbance conditions.
1:39:55
Aquatic species, terrestrial species, and those things were very interesting.
1:40:04
Really, really very important.
1:40:06
The amount of resources that the group had to expend on it, though,
1:40:09
was relatively small, it sounds like, compared to the benefits?
1:40:11
There
1:40:16
was some bootlegging we had to do from our other research.
1:40:20
We
1:40:23
didn’t have a lot of trouble initially getting funding to work up there.
1:40:27
But by ‘83, ‘84, bingo, the dollars vanished.
1:40:31
Okay.
1:40:32
Then it became really hard, almost impossible, to get research dollars.
1:40:37
It was like, we had a great idea for a research project, but if you mentioned
1:40:41
it was at Mount St Helens, forget it.
1:40:43
Hmm.
1:40:43
That was all ancient history.
1:40:46
That was all past.
1:40:47
That
1:40:50
was boring.
1:40:50
Just too much over-exposure or something?
1:40:53
No, I mean it was it was one ten-thousandth of one percent of
1:40:57
real-estate of the United States.
1:40:59
Why the hell do you want to go study at someplace that’s been
1:41:00
hammered by a single blast?
1:41:02
Yeah.
1:41:06
That was the reaction.
1:41:06
And it was very expensive to work up there.
1:41:09
So, the money vanished.
1:41:12
Couldn’t sustain it.
1:41:12
But it’s a wonderful natural laboratory, and every high school in the region
1:41:18
offered to spend time over there.
1:41:21
Every college was out
1:41:25
there.
1:41:26
But initially there was a lot of funding?
1:41:29
Initially, funding was no problem whatsoever.
1:41:31
Helicopters are very expensive.
1:41:34
They are four thousand, back then they were $4000 a day, to rent a helicopter.
1:41:36
I thought it was $20,000 we had to pay for a helicopter, at $400 dollars an hour.
1:41:40
Uh-huh.
1:41:42
Shit, we had unlimited use of helicopters for a while.
1:41:51
For the two weeks we’d be working up there.
1:41:53
Hmm.
1:41:54
We could take joy rides if we wanted to.
1:41:56
Most of the time, we wanted to be down on the ground doing
1:42:00
things rather than flying around.
1:42:01
We’d take flights and look around the crater and crank the motor high
1:42:08
so we could take a look at stuff on
1:42:12
the wall, and watch how rocks would crash down in the crater.
1:42:13
That was a real gas to look at, but it was disappointing as hell, when
1:42:21
it, it evaporated overnight [funding]
1:42:25
. Is that common in funding cycles?
1:42:26
In something as unusual as that.
1:42:29
Yeah, I think is very common.
1:42:32
Okay.
1:42:34
When Hurricane Hugo really clobbered the South Carolina coast in ‘89,
1:42:41
I think, money was available to
1:42:46
follow
1:42:50
that natural
1:42:53
disaster.
1:42:55
Yeah.
1:42:59
Then the site that was following that natural disaster turned
1:43:00
in its proposal in ’92.
1:43:00
The proposal got hammered.
1:43:00
Got clobbered.
1:43:00
They could have capitalized on a natural disturbance.
1:43:04
The NSF panel
1:43:12
was badly administered.
1:43:12
They just got hammered.
1:43:12
The Andrews kind of stands out
1:43:19
for doing this long-term research.
1:43:23
Certain opportunistic events like that can lend themselves to acquiring funding.
1:43:32
If that’s a reoccurring problem, are their problems with essentially
1:43:34
people getting bored, because everybody’s done that already?
1:43:36
For mega-disasters, yeah.
1:43:37
But you can almost always come up with a good reason for why you
1:43:41
need to continue doing measurements on certain kinds of things.
1:43:50
Changes in plant community populations or changes in stream water
1:43:51
chemistry, precipitation acidity.
1:43:58
In the recent past it’s not been too difficult to argue the value of
1:44:04
those continuing data and samples.
1:44:07
It’s
1:44:14
hard to sell disaster sites.
1:44:16
The Exxon Valdez oil disaster is a perfect example.
1:44:17
Yeah.
1:44:17
They wouldn’t be doing what they’re doing up there now if it wasn’t for
1:44:20
penalty money from the Exxon Valdez.

If they
1:44:25
had to rely on federal dollars to launch the recovery of that system up there,
1:44:34
kiss it off.
1:44:36
Attention span is pretty short for
1:44:44
those big disasters.
1:44:44
We have an easier time, I admit.
1:44:49
Things that are germane over larger pieces of real
1:44:54
estate, they have a hard time with that.
1:44:58
Something that’s interesting about the Mount St. Helens disaster was it,
1:45:03
Fred was talking about how it renewed
1:45:07
their contacts.
1:45:08
That scientists with the Andrews went out and got involved with other
1:45:11
groups of scientists at that site.
1:45:13
And I’m curious about how that feedback would work in the other direction
1:45:17
in terms of attracting different kinds of scientists, perhaps to
1:45:21
the Andrews, or a different focus?
1:45:22
So much spun out of that particular case, but I can
1:45:30
think of some other instances where
1:45:34
through LTER
1:45:37
things have happened, like
1:45:41
the hurricane that clobbered Puerto Rico.
1:45:45
Fred was on their advisory committee at the time, and we’ve had some
1:45:49
people come here to work since then.
1:45:53
We’ve had
1:45:56
people come up here to spend time with us
1:46:15
to learn how
1:46:20
we
1:46:38
handle studying the floods.
