00:03
If we can’t do that, it’s not one
00:10
of the options.
00:13
The only other option is to base it on scientific principles, that
00:18
you predict where you are going to find the owl, where you are going to predict
00:19
where you are going to find these things, and what will happen if you change that.
00:23
You have to change your philosophy from first principles to a modeling philosophy,
00:28
and account for large changes in it before you go there and after you change things.
00:33
That’s better than observing and then telling, simply
00:34
reporting, what you observed.
00:37
I liked the observing, but you need the theory at the front end, and that
00:42
takes a lot a work to develop a theory.
00:45
You have to read very widely and very conceptually, and you have to think
00:49
and you have to figure out where to try it, and sometimes you can’t do it.
00:52
Sometimes you’re a decade away, just because the message
00:54
like that can’t be heard yet.
00:55
Sometimes, you’re not the person to do the theory.
00:59
In physics, they don’t ask the people that do the measurements of neutrons
01:03
and these things, to theorize-- they just have to take measurements.
01:07
In biology, we are supposed to be theorists, measuring
01:10
people, and administrators.
01:12
And guess what sometimes suffers?
01:14
Usually the theory.
01:17
You say the LTER network is addressing some of those concerns?
01:21
Not by themselves, because it will take the right people.
01:26
We knew this when we had the IBP, that we had to look to the theories method
01:30
often outside our immediate field, or with people who that had lots of
01:34
experience and who are no longer overly
01:39
involved in measurements.
01:41
It takes time to think.
01:44
When you see the Andrews people writing text books, then, they have time to think.
01:51
But, it takes six-and-a-half years of your life to write a text book, on sabbatical,
01:56
1100 references, you know each one.
02:00
Well,
02:03
it’s great!
02:04
It’s the greatest learning experience you can do.
02:06
But, it’s something you can’t do if overly involved with a huge
02:10
number of graduate students and huge numbers of administrative needs
02:14
and huge numbers of measurements.
02:16
Because, how are you going to do it?
02:19
You are already working 60 hours a week on this text book.
02:23
What you are saying it’s a case of grant writing, the
02:27
collecting of data, or teaching?
02:29
Or teaching, yeah.
02:30
What professor?
02:33
Trying
02:37
to take breaks to think and revitalize yourself, and pause and see what you have
02:43
after five years; that is integrative.
02:47
Remember that is the only thing we are ever going to do that makes a difference.
02:49
It’s not going to be our new methods or, what’s the German
02:53
quote for science’s advance by new methods, new ideas and funerals?
03:00
Okay,
03:03
funerals help a lot, but
03:08
you could go back a hundred years.
03:11
What I am telling you is nothing more than scientific philosophy sort of updated
03:15
with really successful integration.
03:18
What makes it different?
03:20
Good ideas that are testable.
03:22
Do they have to be right?
03:23
No, they have to be interesting and important.
03:27
Lots and lots of problems in the world are not yet clearly testable.
03:31
Doesn’t mean that they are not real problems.
03:32
Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be spending some money on it, but, if you’re asking
03:35
me, is that a really good investment for our best scientific talent in
03:40
universities on problems that we are not quite sure what the theoretical basis is?
03:44
And I’m saying, some is there, but we need the theory.
03:47
And we need general models, and we need testable models in places where
03:52
we haven’t made the measurements yet, so we’re not calibrating the models.
03:55
We are testing our understanding of these things.
03:58
Further away
04:01
the better.
04:01
What you are saying, is that you haven’t seen much of that taking place at the
04:04
Andrews or following the Andrews group?
04:07
No, I wouldn’t expect they could.
04:11
Because of the terrible commitment in time and effort
04:16
just to keep the Andrews moving.
04:18
Now, a lot of them are interbedded with it so they can’t really break
04:22
away and get independent funding.
04:26
You have to write a clean hypothesis, and you have to show the new methods
04:31
that can be developed from that.
04:32
Some of them can do comparison at other sites.
04:36
But that compares morphology.
04:38
There’s nothing wrong with that, but it may not break the theory streak.
04:40
Can you give an example of people doing this kind of
04:44
research you’re talking about?
04:47
The guy that just got the award from the University of Minnesota.
04:52
Little bitty seals, giraffes, and fertilizing, and doing those things.
04:55
Doesn’t mean he is right, but he’s got some ideas and he’s trying to test these
04:59
things, and look at how many species you need before you are redundant.
05:04
And what do a large number of species do in terms of when you have a drought.
05:11
It’s sort of a test.
05:12
And, not everything has to be experimental.
05:14
The other thing you begin to predict, let’s say you go to tropical forest
05:21
and it is a very infertile tropic forest with just nitrogen fixers and
05:27
very low growth, and in those cases you say I would only expect very
05:33
intelligent primates to be present.
05:35
Now why would you say that?
05:36
Because theory says that intelligent primates are the only ones to find fruits
05:40
which is all that is edible and then call their buddies to find out, “Hey, the
05:43
fruits over here.” If it is a very fertile place, then you have lots of leaves
05:50
on a half dozen trees that are edible. You don’t need a big brain for that.
05:54
Therefore, your primates in most cases and maybe more primates
05:57
than in a richer place, those shouldn’t have to be as bright.
06:04
It doesn’t have to be right, okay?
06:07
It comes from the literature, but
06:11
what an example.
06:13
It is examples like those that you give to your students with their own
06:18
problem, they have a problem and you make them think, or you help them think.
06:22
Well, give me a theory, what do you think is the key variable,
06:25
what, were, how does it change?
06:27
How would you test it?
06:28
Let’s go to the literature.
06:30
That takes time.
06:33
It takes a minimum of six months for a graduate student, usually a full
06:37
year in this office, and talking and learning the field before you both feel
06:43
comfortable that we can really test this.
06:46
Sometimes, you have already done the work and it’s a master’s student.
06:48
You have a journeyman opportunity; you are going to use these tools, this is going
06:53
to come out of it, it will be interesting, you will have mastered these tools.
06:57
That is a master’s degree.
06:59
That’s the certification that you can do this, write it up, meet the deadline
07:02
and we will give reasonable thanks.
07:03
It is different than a Ph.D. Or, of course, that is different than my
07:09
idea of a Ph.D. And I don’t want you to run blind for five years like the
07:14
British system does and say, well, if you do well - great, if not, tough.
07:17
[Chuckle] Because we will lose some people from the Midwest that are
07:23
still struggling with what is science.
07:25
They are working hard and they are dedicated, but we forgot
07:29
to introduce them to science.
07:31
I do have a philosophy anyway, it is not a random drift is it.
07:38
Where were you from in Minnesota, by the way?
07:40
Ah, I worked out of Ely,
07:45
and my wife is from Crookston.
07:46
I was born in
07:58
Crookston.
07:58
So, you understand my Midwest.
08:05
[Laughter]
08:05
Can you think of an institution
08:10
that might embody some of the ideals that you have been talking about here?
08:14
Hubbard Brook, and The Ecosystem Center at Woods Hole [MA]
08:18
, particularly when I was there
08:22
in ‘80, whenever it was.
08:26
They had Jim Rollo and John Hobbie, so they had an oceanographer and
08:31
a terrestrial ecologist that are administrators, trying to worry
08:36
about money and people and contacts with Washington to make sure the
08:42
opportunities are greased with good grants.
08:46
They’re also private institutions.
08:47
And in this little bitty building, they will have a bunch of people that are all
08:52
in soft money and they are all writing grants, and the secretaries, they’re not
08:58
called secretaries, but the administrative assistants are all involved.
09:01
When a grant gets funded, everybody celebrates.
09:04
Okay, they have post-docs in from universities, and they have graduate
09:07
students working, and when they are writing stuff the senior scientists are
09:13
helping the young scientists learn how to phrase it and write these grants.
09:16
They focus on the hypothesis, which is a biological approach.
09:21
Other people promise to your product.
09:22
You
09:25
know how to put the references in, and then just cheer when they get it funded.
09:31
Well, they are all dependent on this soft money and they are all
09:33
dependent on the next generation.
09:35
And people pealing out of there have all worked in these
09:38
collaborative relationships with other universities and other
09:41
students, so they have a big network.
09:45
They are doing teaching, and they have seminars every Friday, and they
09:49
sometimes have the janitor come, because he found it very interesting.
09:52
He would come and they would play music.
09:55
It was sort of a weird group in an old wooden building.
09:58
The library was 100 feet away, open 24 hours a day, every day of the
10:04
year, including Christmas, and books, journals were all lined as any biologist
10:10
could figure it out, alphabetically, from the bottom floor to the top.
10:18
Hmm.
10:18
In summer, the whole thing fills up with all the scientists from the Ivy
10:21
Leagues, wanting to come there and establish themselves in the first place.
10:24
That is when all of these other people go to do their field work.
10:28
So, they have it the nine months during the quiet times, so they can do lab work.
10:34
That’s my example right now.
10:36
And they have a nice LTER
10:39
thing at Harvard Forest that they are participating in.
10:47
We work there, too.
10:50
It’s this little building in this unit of people, and watching them grow and
10:54
spin off and go elsewhere and do well, and keep the contacts and bring in the
10:59
new people; it is really exciting to see.
11:01
I think a good scientific philosophy is there, good methods are there,
11:06
and the esprit-de-corps or whatever you want to call it, is still there
11:09
because it isn’t too big and too loose.
11:16
You see this really, really fine thing.
11:19
If you get a chance, you should go sometime.
11:21
Yeah,
11:26
if I do this much longer, I probably will.
11:28
I was going to ask for you to characterize that system more as a mentoring process
11:33
or more of a cooperative process?
11:34
It’s mentoring.
11:35
I
11:38
had mentors.
11:41
You can’t be a mentor unless somebody has done it to you.
11:45
How powerful it is early in your career, and how much difference it makes in
11:49
how you think and who you work with, and you have all kinds of friends.
11:53
The people you actually sign on to do this thing jointly
11:58
with, you have to trust them.
11:59
You don’t have to take them home for dinner, but you have to trust them.
12:02
They are going to keep their word and this is going to be fruitful,
12:06
and preferably really exciting.
12:08
And when that happens, you will never forget the interrelationship
12:13
and neither will they.
12:16
That doesn’t always happen.
12:17
Sometimes you have to work with that, but if you have a choice,
12:18
that is what you work for.
12:24
You mentioned at one point, your mentor at Berkeley, but
12:27
I don’t think I got his name.
12:28
It’s Ed Stone
12:29
Ed Stone
12:29
Yes Berkeley.
12:30
And,
12:33
Egolfs Macusis
12:34
How do you spell it?
12:36
E-g-o-l-f-s, Egolfs, Egolfs.
12:39
I want to make sure I have it spelled right.
13:00
He is Latvian.
13:09
Pretty sure
13:13
that is right.
13:17
He was a scholar who spoke three languages.
13:21
I had another guy, Jack Major, who I had originally came to work with
13:24
me at Davis [UC] . He was another scholar that spoke three languages.
13:27
So, I always felt like I was sort
13:31
of an absolutely inadequate scholar and absolutely inadequate at languages,
13:35
but I could see the value of both.
13:38
I had a chance to go overseas, and I actually did speak
13:41
and teach in German once.
13:45
I love the library.
13:46
I find things in the library that I can integrate and think about in a
13:52
way that I can’t just by traveling.
13:54
I like to travel too.
13:56
Stone
13:58
ran a very large integrative project with his graduate students where they
14:07
had all kinds of controlled environment chambers and all kinds of equipment, and
14:11
I worked with those graduate students.
14:13
I helped them and they helped me.
14:16
He supported me because I was his TA in ecology.
14:21
I was not getting my Ph.D. from him, he was just on my committee.
14:24
But, he still supported me.
14:27
He’s 80ish.
14:27
Still alive, huh?
14:27
Yes, he is still alive, well, both of them are alive [Stone and Major] , and I
14:31
dedicated my part of the second book to
14:36
them.
14:36
There’s other people, too.
14:38
University of Washington,
14:43
Richard Walker; he is a mentor.
14:47
I helped develop with Brian Clearly, a model of a pressure chamber that
14:52
came out to be very useful for taking the pulse of a tree and find out
14:56
how much water stress it is under.
14:57
Well, he asked us to build one and then he introduced me to a whole
15:01
bunch of his German colleagues, because he really does speak German.
15:04
And it ended up that I worked with two of them on my first sabbatical.
15:07
So, that introduced me into 14 countries in Europe, and German things and the
15:13
only article I ever published in German.
15:18
So, there is Richard Walker and he is very active in the IBP.
15:20
He was
15:23
one of the big professors up there that I worked with.
15:29
At UW?
15:29
At UW, yeah.
15:29
It
15:32
really makes a difference.
15:34
Us
15:37
Midwest boys wouldn’t do well if we hadn’t run into these
15:54
mentors.
15:56
I was just curious, the
16:00
difference between this university [OSU] and University of Washington.
16:08
Something about teaching, graduate degrees?
16:10
Do
16:13
you have any regrets that you came here?
16:20
My regrets are more that we have lost some key faculty and we never
16:24
replaced them until very recently.
16:27
One
16:31
was in atmospheric science, we used to have a long time ago some
16:34
very strong atmospheric science people right in the department
16:39
here.
16:39
One got a job and the other guy didn’t get tenure, and for about 8 years
16:44
there was nobody here to work with.
16:49
Those at the University of Washington were harder to work
16:50
with, but they had two of them.
16:54
So, I was thinking at one time about a position up there in botany, because
16:59
they had the talent and lots of money.
17:02
What they didn’t have there, and Jerry Franklin discovered right way,
17:08
is a lot of tolerance for people that have completely different
17:12
viewpoints, which we have here.
17:14
Jerry and I used to argue a lot about his theories and my theories.
17:18
But, there is a certain tolerance where my students aren’t caught up in having
17:24
to make a decision on whether to take that class or not take that class.
17:29
They have always had a problem at University of Washington, particularly
17:32
the College of Forestry, with in-fighting.
17:35
I think it was the original dean that I knew.
17:37
He encouraged this.
17:39
And it was like, God, you should never encourage the faculty to in-fight.
17:43
I mean, they are predisposed to do that for space and for
17:48
students and for philosophy.
17:49
Oh, you want to encourage it [chuckle] for money.
17:52
Then Dale Cole became an associate dean, and Dale has a lots of
17:57
problems in dealing with people.
18:01
It just perpetuated until he retired this year.
18:04
I mean, they still have a different dean, and that.
18:07
I go up there and I love to talk to [Tom] Hinkley and Franklin and
18:11
[Chad] Oliver, but it isn’t equal.
18:16
We
18:18
have our problems, too, particularly my philosophy that I would like to
18:22
have more of a science department and move the management and
18:26
extension over to forest resources.
18:28
We
18:32
originally split the departments in order to allow that to happen,
18:35
but that is history and not many people want to be quoted
18:42
either.
18:43
[Chuckle] I just worry about the next generation of scientists in the
18:46
department, because I can’t worry about the next generation of extension agents.
18:50
Bill Emmingham, I’m sure, is worried about it.
18:54
I worry about seeing whether we can get these proven post-docs that are
18:57
now around the country, including some here, into the department.
19:01
This would include Mark Harmon, Barbara Yoder, I mean, they
19:06
have over-proven themselves.
19:10
It gets to be mental stress where you can’t continue any longer unless you
19:15
get up to a certain level of doing all these things without having nine
19:18
months or five months of salary.
19:25
They are proven.
19:25
It is not a case of I wonder if they can work with our people?
19:28
Gee, I wonder if they are good at writing grants?
19:29
I wonder if
19:36
they will graduate?
19:36
They have already done it.
19:37
It is what you get tenure for.
19:37
And, they have already done it in spades with a couple, three
19:38
million dollars, in grants.
19:40
So, I’m concerned how to get that those kinds of people into the department.
19:43
Not necessarily in abundance, but we have had three or four retirements, Perry,
19:54
Herman, Lavender,
19:57
who’ve not been replaced.
19:59
These are all full-time scientists.
20:02
These weren’t extension people.
20:04
They were the guts, at least, the core group of the older generation of
20:09
international scientists and travelers.
20:17
There is no question that in their time they were scientists that made the
20:23
Forest Science Department recognized.
20:24
Then there is my generation, which includes Dave Perry,
20:27
who I think I did mention.
20:30
I am near retirement and [Mike] Newton’s near retirement.
20:32
All of this is good, if you believe in funerals.
20:35
[Chuckle] But, for the next generation, there is going to be an underpinning
20:40
of science in the general relation to NASA and NSF and global kinds of things.
20:46
You’ve got to have those kind of people not advertised as an assistant
20:50
professor position, when there is nobody left on the staff that does that.
20:55
Phil Sollins is still here, we’re down to the last one.
20:59
The rest are soft money.
21:02
They keep on retiring and not replacing them.
21:06
So, you may have the same problem.
21:11
They must have somebody teach four or five courses.
21:13
Well, we have been doing fairly well.
21:17
Although
21:26
at one time, we were nationally ranked in geography.
21:32
One of the top ten.
21:34
That was twenty years ago.
21:36
And since then, it got down to three faculty and they
21:44
almost didn’t replace the last one.
21:45
It is interesting the normal life span of leadership,
21:52
actual leadership, is about ten years, and of apparent leadership ideas, about 20
22:00
years.
22:00
I like that term of “apparent leadership.”
22:02
Well if you ask all the deans in the country to rank these universities,
22:06
they rank them from a ten-year heritage.
22:08
They don’t rank them for today.
22:08
If you ask the graduate students that are recently out and the post-docs,
22:08
they will rank them for today.
22:16
A
22:18
lot of truth
22:21
in that.
