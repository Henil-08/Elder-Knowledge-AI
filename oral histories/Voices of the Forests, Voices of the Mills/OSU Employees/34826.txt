00:01
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University
00:06
College of Forestry, Forest Ecosystems and Society Department.
00:10
It is November 29,
00:14
2016.
00:14
I am here in Strand Hall with Dr. K. Norman Johnson, Professor of Forestry.
00:24
Professor of Forestry, correct?
00:26
Yeah, I’m Professor of Forest Resources.
00:29
Professor of Forest Resources in the College of Forestry,
00:32
Oregon State University.
00:33
We are going to be doing an oral history interview here today that’s part of
00:37
the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project funded by the PNW Station.
00:42
So, we’ll get started here right now.
00:44
Norm, I start every interview with basically the same question,
00:49
where were you born and raised?
00:50
Just kind of give me a biographical sketch of how it all started.
00:55
Okay, born in Berkeley, California, in 1942.
01:03
And lived in the Bay area until I went to college, lived with my family in
01:12
the Bay area, both in Berkeley and a place called Walnut Creek, and went
01:16
to the University of California at Berkeley, in their forestry program.
01:21
I actually started in engineering, but I switched to forestry, a very small,
01:26
very good program, went there, and
01:32
got interested in forest economics.
01:36
Then began a master’s program there, but
01:45
I was in the largest draft of the Vietnam War, the largest call-up.
01:53
But it turned out, I had a medical disability.
01:55
And after that happened and the trauma of all that, I dropped out and took a job
02:02
with the Klamath Indian Trust, which was a
02:10
trustee for the remaining part of the Klamath Reservation
02:14
that had not been sold.
02:18
During the termination era, right?
02:19
[1950s/1960s]
02:19
Yeah.
02:20
During the termination era.
02:21
That part hadn’t been sold, and I worked there for two years and
02:25
then went to a master’s program at Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin.
02:29
And
02:33
then, I had a series of personal tragedies when I was back there.
02:41
As a result, although I got a Master’s of Science, I didn’t finish a thesis.
02:45
And this was, explain what happened?
02:49
Well, I don’t necessarily want to get into it.
02:51
Oh, okay, I’m sorry.
02:52
It’s just a personal tragedy.
02:53
A couple of personal tragedies in my family.
02:57
Oh,
03:00
okay, all right.
03:01
I then came out to take care of my mother, stayed with her for about six months,
03:08
applied to Oregon State, and ended up here
03:17
in 1968 as a grad student.
03:20
I got under John Beuter and studied forest economics, and
03:27
got a Ph.D. in Forest Management.
03:31
In the process, I got very interested in harvest scheduling,
03:36
and began building computer-based, harvest- scheduling models.
03:42
I built some for various studies Beuter and I did, something called
03:46
the Beuter Report that was pretty well-known in its day about the
03:50
future of forestry in Oregon.
03:53
But I had just finished my degree here, and I didn’t like staying at the same
03:59
place where I got my Ph.D., so I went to Utah State and the faculty there.
04:08
It’s at Utah State that I developed the model called FORPLAN, a
04:13
linear, programming-based, harvest-scheduling model.
04:20
About that time, in the mid ‘70s, the National Forest
04:25
Management Act was passed.
04:26
The national forests had to develop new forest plans.
04:34
It turned out that after a brief discussion, the Forest Service
04:38
decided to require the use of FORPLAN for all forest planning analysis.
04:44
So, your little method, your model in essence, got incorporated
04:48
in after the 1976 act, correct?
04:50
Yeah.
04:51
Okay.
04:52
It became the major vehicle for thinking through national forest plans,
04:57
and it’s lived in infamy ever since.
05:02
And at that time, the allowable cuts were the “coin of the realm.” So, I became very
05:12
well-known in forestry for harvest scheduling and allowable cuts.
05:23
I was at Utah State for a while, I then went to Colorado State, partly because
05:26
at Fort Collins where Colorado State is, was a think-tank for forest planning,
05:31
and enabled me to be at the university and also work in forest planning there.
05:35
And you also have some government agency connections there,
05:39
too, at CSU, Fort Collins?
05:42
Fort Collins, absolutely.
05:42
That’s where the main computer facility was for the Forest Service.
05:46
FORPLAN was overwhelming it, so I ended up over there to help.
05:51
Then in ’85,
05:55
I returned here to Oregon State.
06:01
Now, going back a little bit further, when you were growing up in the East
06:04
Bay, or east of the East Bay, Walnut Creek, that area, what experiences did
06:10
you have in nature that may have led you to have a career that was interested in
06:16
natural resource management and analysis?
06:19
My family, every summer, would go up to a cabin that I loved,
06:22
and a lake called Dark Lake.
06:24
It’s up near Lake Tahoe, it’s a small lake with cabins.
06:30
I really loved it up there.
06:33
Then, we met a Forest Service person whose name escapes me, who was staying in
06:37
one of the cabins, and he talked about a potential career in forestry, outdoors and
06:41
such, and so, I became interested in that.
06:44
But I still started as an engineer at
06:48
Cal-Berkeley, and then soon transferred into forestry.
06:51
Now, aside from Lake Tahoe, is there any other special places that made
06:56
an especially strong reaction on you?
06:59
Well, I just want to say, it wasn’t Lake Tahoe.
07:01
Oh, okay.
07:02
It was about—it was on this side [western] of the range.
07:06
[Sierra Nevada]
07:06
Oh, so it was on the west slope, going up toward --- [the crest]
07:08
. West slope, and some
07:12
small lakes.
07:13
There are cabins on some of them, and you could hike there.
07:21
Okay, small lakes and cabins and
07:25
-- ? We’ll see if anybody wants it, why don’t you shut that off for a minute?
07:29
[Break in audio – changed location]
07:30
Anyway, we’re back on.
07:31
We had to take a brief break.
07:33
Norm was talking about favorite places in nature.
07:37
He was talking about a place that was just outside of Lake Tahoe, and he’s
07:40
going to kind of continue along that path.
07:43
Well,
07:47
this was Dark Lake, and it’s on the west side of the Crystal Range.
07:50
On the other side is Fallen Leaf Lake, and Tahoe is on the west side.
07:56
We used to hike up there and wander through the forest,
07:59
and I really liked that.
08:01
I got interested through meeting someone from the Forest Service,
08:05
who talked to me about the future.
08:07
And so, it was in the back of my mind, but I didn’t really have other places
08:14
or experiences in nature, of great value to me, when I was growing up.
08:20
It was pretty focused on the Dark Lake area.
08:22
Okay.
08:22
Do you remember seeing anything
08:27
that indicated a specific land management dynamic, pollution, disturbance event,
08:35
or anything that made an impression on you about natural resource management,
08:40
or lack thereof, or something that you maybe later on could refer to?
08:44
Well, just one.
08:45
On the road we drove in on, we went there like fifteen years before I went off to
08:53
other things, every summer for two weeks.
08:55
One time, we went across where there had just been a clear-cut, and I found
09:00
that shocking on a national forest.
09:06
It was in an o ld-growth stand, so there was all this debris
09:09
everywhere, and we didn’t like that
09:14
too much.
09:14
We used to be out there fishing, and there were all these cattle grazing.
09:18
They were very benign, but that I really identified cattle with that country that
09:23
wandered through the forest with bells on.
09:25
Now, this was, at that elevation, you’re talking about a mixed fir- [forest]
09:31
? That’s like at 7,500 feet.
09:33
Oh, so you’re in a fir and hemlock?
09:35
Well, it’s fir, yeah.
09:36
All fir?
09:37
Okay.
09:37
Different kinds of fir, pretty much, maybe some mountain hemlock.
09:41
But, yeah, it’s high up there.
09:44
Red fir was the big deal, and they didn’t get much out of that, selling wood.
09:52
At any rate, other than that, no, I didn’t have many experiences.
09:56
I was not a Boy Scout.
09:58
I did not go to summer camps.
10:01
So,
10:06
how do you think that your formative years, and I won’t say lack thereof,
10:11
but relative lack of real immersion in nature, how do you think that
10:15
affected how you view what you wanted to do with your career, and
10:19
then, how your career developed?
10:21
I didn’t know what I wanted to do, other than I had that one experience
10:26
with someone I mentioned, in forestry.
10:28
So, I didn’t have a very good idea of what I wanted to do.
10:34
But,
10:38
I did moderately well in my high school in engineering.
10:41
I don’t really know why I chose engineering at this
10:44
stage; I don’t know why.
10:47
But I didn’t last long in engineering, mainly because I had enormous trouble with
10:51
the German language and learning German.
10:55
So, it wasn’t the math or the physics, it was
10:58
-- ? Yeah, just the language.
11:00
Forestry was one of the few programs at Berkeley that did
11:03
not have a language requirement.
11:06
And this was what year again, remind me?
11:08
You said at the very start.
11:09
This is from 1960 when I went there, and by ’61,
11:16
I was in forestry;
11:21
1961.
11:21
Now, looking back at this, obviously, you’re in ’61, it’s the year before
11:25
Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, two years before the Wilderness Act,
11:28
kind of pre-environmental age, in terms of how you were being
11:32
exposed to professional forestry.
11:36
How would you characterize it today, and how the field was presented to you?
11:41
Well, it was presented first, that foresters knew best, and that really,
11:50
we were going to develop a future forest in which we controlled all disturbances.
11:56
So,
11:59
you very much understood the kind of humanistic attitude, we can control nature
12:05
with good planning and multiple-use?
12:07
Oh, yeah.
12:07
Yeah.
12:08
You know, targeted in this specific way, managed in this, I won’t say,
12:12
perfect way, but in this really logical, systematic way, was going to yield
12:17
greatest good for the greatest number?
12:18
Except, mainly timber harvest.
12:20
Right.
12:20
Sustained yield of timber harvest yields all these benefits.
12:25
Yeah, that’s what was taught there.
12:27
That’s what I learned.
12:30
Very much so.
12:31
Although I didn’t realize I was learning that, I was
12:34
learning that to take that view.
12:35
Now, you mentioned the name of one of your mentors.
12:38
Was it Beuter?
12:40
Well, Beuter, my mentor, as in my undergraduate days, was Henry Vaux,
12:43
who was a well-known forest economist and policy person, and he was my
12:48
mentor at the undergraduate level.
12:50
And then at the graduate level here at Oregon State, it was John
12:52
Beuter, who was another economist.
12:54
About Vaux, what do you remember he taught you, and the things that you
12:58
took out of that beyond passing your classes and learning your topics?
13:05
Well, Hank Vaux taught me how to think like an economist, and economists
13:11
think in a particular way, especially in terms of marginal analysis
13:16
and looking at alternatives, and
13:21
to understand benefits and costs.
13:25
He taught me all of that.
13:27
He helped me develop an ability to think that way.
13:31
And then he also was a master at asking questions, something
13:36
I’ve never been near as good at.
13:37
And that ability, I grew to appreciate.
13:42
So that was my beginning as a forest economist.
13:49
So,
13:52
how did you see forest economics being taught 20-25-30 years later
13:57
at Oregon State, in the context of remembering those initial
14:00
exposures and your initial training?
14:03
Oh, I think it has been taught almost exactly as I learned it.
14:08
Still?
14:08
Yeah, in terms of those fundamental concepts.
14:13
The purely economic and numerical?
14:17
Yeah, just a notion about marginal analysis and benefits
14:20
in costs and development of alternatives in their evaluation.
14:24
That’s still the way economics is taught.
14:28
There may be a different way of valuing things, but it is still taught that way.
14:39
So, what would you call the most important management principles of forestry
14:44
and land management at that time?
14:47
Sustained yield of timber harvest.
14:50
Everything was organized around
14:53
that.
14:53
Was the concept of ecology ever mentioned?
14:57
Yeah, I took ecology.
14:58
Okay.
14:59
But ecology, I did very well in it.
15:03
At that time, it was really focused, especially with my professor,
15:11
on how to get seedlings to grow.
15:14
How do you understand the climate, the microclimate, and the environment,
15:18
again, in order to get timber production.
15:21
That was the focus in the ecology class.
15:24
Interesting.
15:25
And a lot of the paradigms and examples were from the early classic
15:30
ecologists, Clements and those folks, and then bring it forward?
15:35
Actually, the book was by Daubenmire [Rexford-plant ecologist-Wash.
15:38
St. Univ.] , I think.
15:40
So, it wasn’t too much about; there were ideas of climax forests and things, but
15:51
disturbances were not, disturbance ecology was not a strong part of it.
15:58
There was the notion about climax equilibrium, so I guess, that
16:00
is what we were talking about.
16:03
But it really was focused on how to understand the environment
16:07
in order to grow trees better.
16:10
Kind of what you would expect?
16:12
Yeah.
16:12
At that time, right.
16:15
I mean, how long ago was that?
16:16
That is 55 years ago, just 55 or 54 years ago, I took ecology.
16:26
The teacher, though, made everyone sit in alphabetical order.
16:32
[Laughs]
16:32
Do you still make your students do that?
16:34
No, but also,’61 and ’62, were the last two years in which every
16:40
male undergraduate was in ROTC every quarter, and out there
16:44
marching on the parade ground.
16:46
At Cal-Berkeley?
16:47
Yes.
16:47
Once a week.
16:49
Wow.
16:49
And then, of course, they kind of tried to burn down the buildings in ROTC.
16:52
I was going to say, how many years later did they have the
16:55
massive protests at Berkeley?
16:56
[Vietnam War protests]
16:57
There’s two.
16:57
I was the last class to really go through the two years of ROTC.
17:01
Interesting.
17:02
Yeah, I had a rifle I was issued, and I got to march wearing the uniform.
17:07
But
17:09
like you said before, you didn’t go to ‘Nam because you had a medical exemption?
17:13
Yes, yeah.
17:14
So, your career develops in the late ‘60s, on your
17:19
professional track you move around and eventually end up here back at
17:23
Oregon State after a first stay.
17:25
What do you remember about the change in culture and politics in
17:30
that, shall we say, twenty years, fifteen years, leading up to what
17:34
would become called the Forest Wars?
17:38
[Political
17:41
struggle over logging in NW.]
17:41
Well, we started in Moreland Hall right over here.
17:45
It’s next to the MU [Memorial Union campus center building] . It’s right
17:47
opposite, on that side of Moreland Hall.
17:50
That’s where the college of forestry was.
17:52
Where?
17:52
Close to what?
17:54
Right next to the Long House?
17:55
Okay, right.
17:56
You been to the Long House at all?
17:58
Yeah, the Indian one.
18:00
They started in the Quonset hut right next to Moreland, which is
18:01
now right there behind Moreland, and that Quonset hut is where I
18:08
was as a grad student.
18:09
Really?
18:10
Yeah, in there.
18:11
I was just in there today.
18:13
But
18:15
the difference was that
18:22
in the Spring of ’69 or
18:26
the Spring of ’70, was
18:30
the first Earth Day, and the whole campus shut down.
18:34
We all organized to learn about the environment.
18:38
So, that was a big deal.
18:39
The whole campus, for a day closed.
18:42
It was 1970, actually.
18:43
Yeah, I thought so.
18:45
It was.
18:45
Gaylord Nelson, a Senator from Wisconsin, was kind of the political leader, but
18:51
it was more organic than that, too.
18:54
But yeah, it was 1970.
18:54
But at any rate, that was a big deal, and so it certainly seemed like
18:58
something was different in the air.
19:00
And what do you remember about seeing this happen, and of
19:06
course, NEPA was the same year.
19:08
Yeah.
19:09
I mean, January 1 , it was signed into law by Richard Nixon, of all people.
19:16
Did you have any idea that what was going to happen was going to happen?
19:19
In other words, no longer were Forest Service and [other] agencies
19:24
able to, shall we say, impose the economic model that you were trained
19:29
in on lands without public input.
19:34
I mean, could you see that coming, or did it kind of come over like a wave?
19:38
Well, when I took forest policy in 1965, there were no environmental laws.
19:46
So, what we learned as forest policy was mainly trespass
19:50
law and land development law.
19:53
So no, I didn’t see this coming at all in 1970.
20:04
Now, by the early ‘70s, with the Bitterroot Report
20:12
and other reports, there was obviously a citizen uprising going on about
20:17
managing the national forests.
20:21
I didn’t think though, it would necessarily change the management
20:24
model, it was just that you were going to have to account for it.
20:29
So, I didn’t see it as fundamentally changing things.
20:31
You didn’t see that it was a tsunami that was eventually, over fifteen to
20:36
twenty years, going to do what it did.
20:37
Correct?
20:38
No, no.
20:38
Now, when the Endangered Species Act was passed in ’73, was that
20:45
also just something, you said, okay?
20:46
Or did you
20:47
--? I didn’t hardly notice it.
20:48
Didn’t hardly notice it.
20:49
Clean Water [Act] and all those?
20:50
Clean Water Act, yes, because that influenced the state, led
20:54
to the creation of the Oregon State Forest Practices Act in ’71.
20:59
Right.
20:59
So, that one I knew, that one was in the air.
21:03
But the Endangered Species Act seemed a pretty foreign idea,
21:07
not going to influence things.
21:09
Now, if you were going to characterize
21:14
the evolution of the major forest planning acts that would affect, shall we say,
21:20
the pre-Northwest Forest Plan Act going really to, back to ’44, the Sustained
21:25
Yield Act, in 1960, wasn’t it the Multiple Use Act, and then ’76, which was the big
21:30
keystone leading up to what would happen later, the Forest Management Act of 1976.
21:38
How would you characterize that evolution and what did those things
21:42
do well, and what maybe did they not do, or maybe not account for?
21:48
Well, the
21:56
1944 Act was sustained-yield at the apex.
21:59
It said in it that sustained-yield provides all the multiple-use of benefits.
22:05
And so, that was really the apex of sustained-yield, and trying to
22:08
institutionalize it across owners.
22:12
It, in the end, didn’t have much impact.
22:15
But the Multiple Use Act didn’t mean much.
22:18
That just codified
22:21
what the Forest Service was doing, and left it almost
22:24
unlimited discretion to do it.
22:26
But didn’t it underscore a little more that recreation should have a little
22:29
higher niche in the multiple use portion of the eight categories, or whatever?
22:34
There was like six or eight categories.
22:35
Well, it’s true that the Forest Service was in a battle for the Park Service
22:39
to be the nation’s recreationists.
22:41
But it didn’t in any fundamental way alter the primacy of timber production.
22:47
Now, the ’76 act.
22:48
What did that do that was different?
22:50
But let me just say about the Wilderness Act, which is--
22:53
Oh, okay.
22:54
The Wilderness Act was very important for two reasons.
23:00
First off, it really
23:05
tried to divide up the forest into two parts, which had been going on
23:10
informally, but this formalized that idea.
23:12
In other words, the primitive areas [U.S. Forest Service] that were just
23:14
marked off, but it was formalizing and putting more rules on those?
23:18
And the rest was for timber production.
23:20
That’s how it was interpreted, so dividing things up.
23:22
Exactly.
23:23
But also, it called for a review of roadless areas adjacent to wilderness,
23:26
which the Forest Service took to mean review of roadless areas everywhere.
23:26
That was a third of the national forests, and they got stuck
23:26
in the goo of road-less areas,
23:39
and couldn’t get out.
23:41
The
23:48
result, the national forests are getting pretty well hammered out
23:50
in the roaded areas, which I think added to the discontent of people.
23:55
The Forest Service got stuck in the road-less quandary and tried all these
23:59
times to fix it, and never could.
24:00
So, I think the
24:04
Wilderness Act, not only did it identify the value of wilderness,
24:06
it helped contribute to public discontent with how the Forest Service
24:10
was managing the rest of the area.
24:12
Because that was RARE I, and there was RARE II.
24:14
[Roadless Area Review and Evaluations]
24:14
Yeah.
24:15
And they took forever, and they never really got finished, did they?
24:18
No.
24:19
Because RARE II was in the ‘80s, wasn’t it?
24:21
Yeah.
24:21
And RARE I was ’71-’72, when they started.
24:24
RARE I had the misfortune to be started before NEPA, but
24:28
completed after it was done.
24:34
That had real impact and created some
24:37
of
24:43
the negative perceptions by the public.
24:45
Getting up to the National Forest Management Act,
24:50
by that time, I was sponsored by timber management in the Forest Service
24:56
to build planning models for them.
24:59
And they liked me a lot.
25:02
I built planning models, and partly because it showed how to maintain
25:07
sustained-yield and still have a pretty health timber harvest, a
25:11
sustained yield of timber production.
25:13
As the result, and by that time I was at Utah State, I was doing various
25:21
analyses of the National Forest Management Act, and one of mine which got
25:27
written up in the Congressional Record,
25:31
was cautioning the Senate that the act they were passing was somewhat
25:38
imperfect, and then, the day after that, they passed it, 92 to nothing.
25:42
So much for your advice, right?
25:45
So I was working for the national forests, and timber management
25:45
was all-powerful in those days.
25:45
What happened then
25:51
was, the head of
26:00
timber management, Don Funk, took a liking to me, and
26:07
they began to really promote my models as the way you do
26:10
planning in the national forests.
26:16
Then, a
26:25
committee of scientists was formed to help the secretary of agriculture
26:34
write the regulations,
26:37
and for implementing the act.
26:41
The range rep was Thad Box, who was my dean, and one of my other teachers
26:46
from Berkeley was Dennis Teagarden, an economist, and he was on it.
26:51
Because of the two of them, I became a consultant to the committee of scientists.
26:57
And I was just an assistant professor, but I really knew
26:59
this harvest scheduling stuff.
27:02
For a lay person, how would you describe your models in terms of forest economics?
27:08
My models?
27:08
If you were going to give a sketch of maybe one or two of your models of
27:12
specific plans, how would you describe it?
27:15
For the models, what I was doing, I was figuring out, given the forest that
27:24
existed and its potential growth rate and different restrictions on it to
27:32
reach goals like recreation or wildlife,
27:37
my models helped find the maximum sustained harvest level that could occur.
27:43
That’s what the models did.
27:45
And then you’d change, maybe you’d allocate more land to wilderness and
27:49
less to timber production, or maybe you’d change the way timber production was done.
27:53
You’d do it, rerun the model, and see the results.
27:55
I did a lot of that.
27:55
That’s what
28:00
those models were.
28:02
It was simple in concept, but by this time, there were a lot of these other
28:07
considerations you tried to factor in.
28:09
Even though in retrospect, the model didn’t fit very well with the problem, if
28:14
the problem is protection of biodiversity, because the models generally didn’t have
28:18
a very significant spatial component.
28:21
Still, that’s what was being done, and what I was doing.
28:25
So, the National Forest Management Act was passed to reign in timber production.
28:32
That’s what it was all about.
28:34
My models were how you were going to calculate how much harvest level you
28:38
needed, so I was deeply involved with the committee of scientists to help interpret
28:45
the National Forest Management Act, which led to the 1979 and then ’82
28:55
planning rules [U.S. Forest Service] , which only in 2012 was replaced.
28:59
From 1982 to 2012, that was the rule for 30 years.
29:04
How would you characterize the ’76 Act, its strengths and weaknesses?
29:09
Well, it was an attempt to reign in timber production.
29:12
That was its purpose, to really reform timber production.
29:17
So, it was a recognition things were going too much toward production?
29:22
Oh, yes.
29:23
Okay.
29:24
But Congress didn’t intend to upset the apple cart.
29:28
That was very clear.
29:30
They didn’t see it as a revolutionary act.
29:33
Still, it was going to be sustained-yield, multiple-use.
29:37
But the way the regulations were written, they laid within them the
29:42
seeds for major change, the number one aspect of it, for purposes of the
29:50
Northwest Forest Plan, was the viability rule.
29:53
The viability clause?
29:55
Yeah, viability clause.
29:56
And describe what the viability clause, in your words, what that
30:00
is, and why it was important?
30:02
Well, the viability clause basically stated that you needed to have habitat
30:08
to support viable populations of native vertebrates well-distributed
30:16
across the planning area.
30:17
[Endangered Species Act + species viability in general.]
30:18
And this is, of course, where the s potted owl and the animals that were later, very
30:24
shortly thereafter, listed under the ESA, correct, and that’s how they got attached?
30:30
Well, actually, not quite.
30:32
Okay.
30:34
That rule applied to anything with vertebrae, whether or not they
30:39
were threatened or endangered.
30:40
Okay.
30:55
Basically, what happened is that the agency could not develop
31:01
scientifically credible approaches to conserve these species and to provide
31:07
habitat for viable populations.
31:09
They were unable to do that.
31:12
But that became the dominant consideration all through the Northwest Forest
31:18
Plan; that was this habitat for viable populations, now for all species,
31:25
not just vertebrates, were spread, well-distributed, over the planning area.
31:30
So, that particular clause in the regulation swamped everything else.
31:38
And that’s the one that caused all the issues in the ‘80s as the Forest
31:44
Service, the BLM, the Fish and Wildlife.
31:46
Yeah.
31:47
And all the stuff got tied up together, the listings and all that stuff?
31:50
And it had to do with the viability clause and interpretations of it?
31:53
Correct?
31:54
The management had to do with the viability clause, but
31:59
what happened along the way,
32:03
was when a species got in enough difficulty that it was listed, then a
32:09
separate process started to deal with the listing and what would happen.
32:13
But the viability clause was important and a driver without ESA.
32:22
And really, it was the viability clause much more than ESA,
32:26
that drove all of it under the
32:32
Northwest Forest Plan.
32:33
It was the viability clause,
32:36
and the
32:39
Forest Service’s inability to develop a scientifically-credible approach
32:46
to protecting the vertebrates to meet the viability clause.
32:50
It just so happens that the northern spotted owl became the
32:55
poster child for all of that because of its very wide-ranging
32:58
requirements, and because they were in the mature, old-growth forests.
33:02
Those are big home ranges.
33:05
So, they were really the fly in the ointment of continuing
33:10
harvest of old growth.
33:12
And the fact that they are, shall we say, a charismatic mega-fauna,
33:16
probably adds to the mix, right?
33:17
Yeah, absolutely.
33:20
I mean, if the murrelet was the first bird that came out, it wouldn’t have
33:24
been as sexy in terms of the symbolism.
33:27
Right?
33:27
No, not at all.
33:27
I don’t want to tell Marty that, right?
33:29
[Laughs]
33:29
Yeah.
33:31
But that’s Martin Raphael.
33:33
[Lead Scientist on NWFP; focus on murrelet]
33:34
Oh, I know who.
33:35
No, I know that, I’m talking for the record.
33:36
Oh, I see.
33:37
I know you know who he is.
33:39
Now, before the Northwest Forest Plan and the general era encompassed by, it
33:43
could be said that science was used in the service of timber and the economic goals.
33:48
How would you describe the paradigm shift towards science that became almost
33:55
primary in terms of how decisions were made and legal paradigms were met?
34:03
Another kind of science.
34:05
There’s a science behind inventory and growth and yield, and
34:09
there’s a science there, too.
34:11
But it was at one time, for 50-60 years, a very important science.
34:19
But the problem changed, so it wasn’t maximum sustained-harvest levels any more.
34:25
It was providing habitat for viable populations.
34:29
For that, you need a whole different set of scientists and science.
34:34
And for quite a while, the Forest Service didn’t realize
34:37
that, and I didn’t realize it.
34:39
So, when was your realization point?
34:42
When you got hit between the eyes, and said, wow, the game has changed?
34:51
Was there a moment, or it was more of a long process?
34:59
When I came back to Oregon.
35:03
Early ‘80s, right?
35:05
In ’85.
35:07
Okay.
35:11
The national forests were trying to complete their forest plans.
35:14
They’d been trying to complete them for years.
35:16
There was an incredible political controversy over what was going to happen,
35:24
and thus, they were stuck because they couldn’t satisfy enough
35:29
people, enough politicians, to be able to publish their plans.
35:33
And in 1986, there was a gubernatorial race.
35:37
That gubernatorial race was between Neil Goldschmidt, who’s
35:41
fallen far away, and Norma Paulus.
35:49
National Forest harvest levels were part of the controversy in that
35:53
election, and part of their debates.
36:00
Neil Goldschmidt,
36:05
at one of his debates with Norma Paulus, said, “And there’s this
36:13
$10 million or something computer model that sets harvest levels that nobody
36:17
understands, that’s driving all this.” Someone had told me that about FORPLAN.
36:23
Well, as soon as he got elected
36:24
-- This
36:28
was Goldschmidt, right?
36:29
Yeah.
36:29
He made a commitment to have the state weigh in on the forest plans,
36:33
a guy named Stub Stewart was one of his benefactors, from Bohemia
36:39
[forest products company] . They asked if I’d go to work for them,
36:43
and I had only been here six months, working from the university.
36:48
I did [accept] , and I started trying to develop
36:55
plans for the state, working with state agencies, so they would have at least as
37:02
high a harvest level as the [U.S.] Forest Service, and still meet these other goals.
37:06
After trying that in three or four forests, I reached the realization
37:11
it was impossible, that we were headed for a big fall in harvest
37:16
levels, and I told the governor that.
37:19
That’s when I knew it.
37:21
That was in
37:25
’87, ’88, that just isn’t going to happen.
37:28
You just can’t do it [old model] anymore.
37:36
Soon after that, I went back to the university.
37:41
I told them, you just can’t continue.
37:43
We did a whole bunch of analysis, and a whole bunch of comments.
37:46
I finally said, these west side forests were where it happened -- the
37:50
Umpqua, the Willamette, and Mount Hood -- you just can’t do that anymore.
37:55
Siuslaw, too, right?
37:56
Wasn’t that one of them, too?
37:58
Yes.
37:58
The Siuslaw, though, didn’t trouble me as much as the others, because
38:08
the Siuslaw doesn’t have much old growth, and it has a very, very productive forest.
38:14
And so, you can cover up a lot of sins with that.
38:19
Because of the rapid regrowth rates?
38:20
Yeah, you didn’t really have old growth, and we had public
38:26
meetings all over the state.
38:27
I finally concluded, you just can’t get there from here.
38:31
That’s when I realized we were really headed for a big change.
38:36
It was then.
38:37
Now, what are the issues, magnified in any one area or in any one forest?
38:43
I know the Willamette for many years was the number one [nationally] in terms
38:47
of harvest, in terms of board-feet.
38:50
Was it any more magnified there or any one forest, or was it just kind of spread out?
38:55
It was everywhere.
38:57
It was just everywhere.
38:59
And what was the problem that screamed out to you, why you said
39:04
this can’t continue like this?
39:06
Well,
39:09
that
39:12
given the management requirements
39:19
to meet the viability clause,
39:24
you couldn’t maintain anywhere near the harvest level.
39:29
You just couldn’t do
39:35
it.
39:36
So, I just said to them, you can’t, it isn’t going to happen.
39:39
And what was their response, or the governor’s office response?
39:43
The governor’s office response was pretty much to pull back from their deep
39:48
involvement with the national forests.
39:50
Okay, so they focused more on state lands after that point?
39:55
No,
40:04
what happened was.
40:05
Let me just say it.
40:07
What happened was, I told them that,
40:15
and soon thereafter came the ISC Report.
40:21
You know it as the Thomas Report.
40:22
In 1990, right, the one that Jack Ward Thomas oversaw and wrote?
40:26
Right?
40:28
That came out.
40:32
I was still with the governor’s office then, right at the end.
40:35
After I told them that, the Thomas Report came out.
40:39
And that was really breathtaking, because that was the first time somebody,
40:46
a group, had said to heck with the allowable cut, we’re just going to find
40:49
a scientifically credible plan for the northern spotted owl, and they did.
40:55
And
40:57
not only that, but that means you need different kinds of people worrying
41:01
about the analysis, as allowable cuts and cutting models aren’t the key.
41:07
I mean, we’re going through a very, in some small way, a
41:12
revolution in resource management.
41:16
And that’s when I really knew, boy, the party’s over.
41:21
What do you remember about the environmental movement, the more
41:25
assertive protests, people up in trees, and what do you remember about all that
41:29
during the ‘80s, because it started to really accelerate up into the ‘90s?
41:38
That’s when I learned that people can easily lose their minds over
41:44
trees [laughs], that it’s one of the most emotional connections
41:49
people have, with big-old trees.
41:52
Yeah, and so,
41:55
we used to have public meetings that would go on for six hours.
41:58
But the people in the communities liked that because the Forest
42:02
Service wouldn’t let them speak any more into the microphone.
42:05
The Forest Service was so gun shy with being yelled at.
42:08
So,
42:14
at any rate, we were in the middle of a storm, I knew that, and it just seemed
42:20
part and parcel, given their strong feelings, that they’d be up in the trees.
42:24
Just like the loggers and the millworkers would be just beside
42:28
themselves with what was going to happen to them and their families.
42:31
I mean, it
42:37
was a very difficult time, but
42:47
it just
42:53
wasn’t clear how we were going to get out of this.
42:55
It wasn’t clear at all.
42:56
The Thomas Report changed that.
42:59
They said the scientists -- the wildlife scientists especially -- are going to have
43:03
a big role in the future, when they had almost no role before that.
43:07
So, from the time that you read that, you knew that it was a game-changer, but how
43:13
did you get involved, and how did the Gang of Four -- I know how it was named -- but
43:20
still, how did that whole process start?
43:21
How was it named?
43:22
It was named by a timber industry person, kind of a pejorative term, right?
43:28
I think it was named by Kathie Durbin.
43:31
[One story about origin]
43:31
The reporter for The Oregonian?
43:33
Yeah.
43:34
Oh.
43:35
I’ve read that it was a pejorative term by some timber person.
43:38
Well, it could be.
43:39
[Timber industry person; from Jerry Franklin interview]
43:39
Oh, okay.
43:40
But it certainly wasn’t us.
43:41
No, I know that.
43:43
What did you guys think of that, the Gang of Four name?
43:47
I mean, we had these long names.
43:48
It’s kind of like the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse, like the Notre
43:50
Dame Backfield [iconic football backfield in 1920s/cultural reference]
44:00
. We had this long name, Scientific Committee for the Late Successional
44:03
Forests or something like that.
44:05
Oh, you know, things were just happening.
44:07
You didn’t have a strong sense of being in control.
44:11
So, you’d just go with the flow, yeah.
44:16
But what happened there is the
44:25
Thomas Committee, and the Thomas Report came out.
44:32
Election.
44:34
Goldschmidt doesn’t run again.
44:40
Roberts, what was her name?
44:44
Her first name?
44:46
Barbara Roberts.
44:46
Barbara Roberts.
44:47
There’s also a Betty Roberts, so
44:50
I get them confused.
44:50
She came into office.
44:52
I had gone back just before.
44:53
Was she governor then?
44:54
Yeah.
44:54
Oh, okay, right.
44:55
She was governor during the development of the Northwest Forest Plan.
45:04
You know, they wanted me to serve as the Oregon State Rep on the recovery,
45:08
Spotted Owl Recovery Plan, and by then, I said, “No, there’s a much bigger issue
45:12
than that.” So, what happened is that
45:19
the “Gang of Four” was put together by two people.
45:25
I don’t know if, is it fair to ask, has Franklin’s talked to you about that?
45:31
How it was put together?
45:32
Yeah, but go ahead.
45:34
Did he talk about that?
45:36
Somewhat,
45:39
but tell me your recollection if it?
45:42
Yeah, he talked about it.
45:43
It was put together by Jim Lyons and John Beuter.
45:47
Oh, I’m not sure he told me that, but okay.
45:49
Jim Lyons
45:54
was the forestry advisor for the Ag Committee which shares jurisdiction
45:58
with the Interior Committee, or did, on the national forests.
46:00
Oh, he did mention Jim Lyons, now I recall.
46:02
But the other person was John Beuter.
46:06
Here at Oregon State, correct?
46:07
No, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Agriculture [at that time]
46:12
. Oh, so he had moved up from his days here.
46:14
He’s the guy that you knew from Oregon State, correct?
46:16
Yeah.
46:17
So, Lyons was working for the House under Kika de la Garza [D-Texas],
46:28
Chairman of the Ag Committee.
46:30
Lyons was a Democrat.
46:31
Beuter was working for a Republican administration, the first Bush.
46:37
So, they got together and convinced their bosses this was a good idea,
46:46
and so, they got the four of us [Gang of Four] . They got Thomas, of
46:52
course, because he knew about owls.
46:54
But this is really an old-growth issue, so they got Franklin.
46:57
They got me because I knew harvest levels.
47:00
And they got John Gordon because; go ahead
47:05
- No.
47:05
[Continue]
47:05
- John Gordon has the “voice of God,” He had been department head here
47:11
and in one other department. Beuter was another. And he [Gordon] had
47:15
been Jim Lyons’ mentor at Yale.
47:20
And Jerry said something about John.
47:22
He says, “John’s the closest thing we had to a forest ambassador.” I think he
47:27
described him as that and the voice, his sonorous, James Earl Jones-ish voice.
47:33
Yes.
47:36
Stop it for a second.
47:38
[Break in Audio] And so, those two people got together and put
47:42
together this group, this team.
47:46
And do you want me to talk about that?
47:49
Yeah, absolutely.
47:51
Then
47:54
we went to
48:00
Congress and talked to them.
48:02
First off, they wanted a plan, and my dean at the time said, “You can do this, but
48:09
you’ve got to come up with alternatives.” Which is what I wanted to do anyway.
48:12
Additionally, he mentioned fish; “Don’t let’s get surprised by some damn fish.” I
48:17
knew we didn’t have fish people involved. So, and it’s kind of convoluted, but just
48:24
to get to the punch line, I called up Gordie Reeves, as he may have told you.
48:30
I said, “Come and help us just for a little bit.”
48:31
The “Gang of Four Plus Two,” in other words.
48:33
Yeah.
48:34
And that’s what got them involved.
48:35
Sedell, too, Jim Sedell.
48:37
I didn’t ask for Jim Sedell.
48:49
Anyway, so I asked
48:53
Gordie Reeves
48:56
to come and help.
48:58
He asked Jim Sedell.
49:00
And that really was the beginning of what’s become the aquatic conservation
49:04
strategies, as probably Reeves
49:10
told you about.
49:12
At any rate, we were given, there’s a letter, the request.
49:16
It’s at the back of the “Gang of Four” report from Congress.
49:21
Yeah, I believe you have the letter at the back. It is, there’s a letter at the back.
49:25
[Both looking at copy of “Gang of Four” report.]
49:26
Well, I copied all the pages you gave me, Norm.
49:27
Yeah, just look at the very back.
49:29
Yeah, let me see what we got here.
49:31
Let me turn this off.
49:32
[Break in audio.] We are looking at the May 22, 1991 letter from the Congress
49:39
to Dr. Johnson, and basically, as a follow-up, as it says, to the hearings
49:46
that you took a part in, right?
49:49
Yes.
49:51
Jim Lyons,
49:55
Franklin and I wrote this letter.
49:59
Jim Lyons was the aide to Kika de la Garza, one of the signatories.
50:06
The letter was important because it did change from asking for a plan to asking
50:16
for alternatives, which is what we wanted.
50:19
We did not want to propose a plan that—
50:21
So, in other words, they first asked for a plan.
50:24
Because the Thomas Committee had given a plan.
50:26
The Thomas Committee didn’t give alternatives.
50:29
So, in other words, the singular thing that would be the plan versus
50:33
a range, an array, if you will.
50:35
Multiple plans with different characteristics, yeah.
50:38
Right.
50:38
So, but what was real important here, is that it said,
50:48
“We encourage you to solicit the assistance of others that may be helpful
50:51
in this endeavor, including resources and personnel from the Forest Service,
50:54
Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management. To facilitate
50:57
this request, we are writing the heads of each of those agencies to request
51:00
their cooperation in this regard.”
51:05
And when they said that, that was carte blanche to involve all these specialists.
51:12
The “ologists,” if you will.
51:13
Yeah.
51:16
Also, this now is about alternatives.
51:18
And while it may not say it in this letter, they wanted
51:22
it done in three weeks.
51:26
And we took six weeks.
51:28
Is this the one that where you also, where Jerry got you guys together
51:34
at the [Portland Memorial] Coliseum?
51:35
Jerry and Jack.
51:36
Jerry and Jack got you together in the Coliseum in Portland, right?
51:39
I mean, it was like a year or two before FEMAT, before the Clinton Summit, right?
51:44
Yeah, it was.
51:47
And that’s where they mapped the old growth, and mapped key watersheds,
51:51
and in a week or in six days.
51:59
Congress then realized
52:03
there was more to these forests than the northern spotted owl, and they
52:06
wanted to get to the punch line.
52:10
“Specifically, we ask you to evaluate different approaches for taking
52:13
ecologically significant old growth and late successional ecosystems
52:16
species and processes, including, but not confined to spotted owls.”
52:22
They knew there was more to it.
52:23
They just wanted to get to the punch line, and so, they
52:27
asked this group to analyze it.
52:30
And we, in kind of a wild, crazy six weeks, we produced this report.
52:40
My kids helped me put the copies of it together.
52:49
So, how would you characterize the collaborative dynamic regarding this
52:54
report, which I believe involved the Forest Service, BLM, Fish and
52:59
Wildlife, but also academics, correct?
53:02
As that would be those four, and maybe even State of Oregon and Washington
53:05
officials, as well, or was it?
53:07
Yeah.
53:07
Well, first off, I want to say, it didn’t involve any agencies at all.
53:11
Okay.
53:12
It only involved people within them.
53:14
Okay, I got you.
53:16
But not the agencies.
53:18
Okay, right.
53:18
And so, in that way, it’s the one report in all of this that
53:22
doesn’t have an agency imprint, which is why you weren’t given it.
53:28
[Laughs] That’s why.
53:29
Oh, okay.
53:30
To be blunt about it.
53:32
This report was totally
53:33
— It doesn’t have a flag of—doesn’t have Smokey’s flag or
53:39
-- ? No, it doesn’t have anything.
53:41
It was the really, it was an outlaw effort, outside the
53:46
bounds of the bureaucracy.
53:47
Now, what do you say about why that was maybe special or different, or
53:52
what this type of report without strictures of agency, politics and
53:56
rules and paradigms, why was this maybe “outside the box” and maybe a really,
54:02
truly novel and informative document?
54:06
Because what was going on there is that, unless you push the agencies
54:11
aside, they were totally committed to all their timber sales and all their
54:16
old-growth sales they had laid out.
54:18
All of these things, and you were just smashing right through
54:23
them.
54:23
So, the Thomas Report was very helpful in starting that.
54:27
But this continued it, and really, the agency had exhausted itself three times
54:35
trying to come up with a spotted owl plan, and three times Judge Dwyer rejected it.
54:41
And so, the inmates had taken over the prison.
54:46
Basically, some of the Thomas Report was expanded, because in this one,
54:52
we didn’t come up with a plan.
54:53
We came up with forty alternatives, and said, you guys pick the plan.
54:58
We don’t know, we’ve done all we can.
55:05
I’d heard that during this whole process, including during, before and
55:09
after the congressional hearings and these reports, that some of the leaders
55:14
in the Forest Service, specifically Dale Robertson, became apoplectic.
55:19
Yeah, so did John Butruille.
55:23
When we reported on this to Congress, I’ll never forget sitting there on
55:29
the bench at one of the hearings with Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves.
55:39
Looking up, Butruille, who is about eight feet tall, he’s this
55:42
ex-Marine with red hair, and his face was so red, it was just crimson.
55:46
And he’s with what?
55:48
He was Regional Forester, Region 6.
55:50
[Pacific NW/Alaska]
55:50
That’s what I thought.
55:51
What he was mad about was them saying that the forest plans wouldn’t protect fish.
55:55
Dale Robertson had just gotten these awards from Trout
55:58
Unlimited, and he was so mad.
56:02
But luckily, as Reeves probably told you, such claims were
56:05
in their own forest plans.
56:06
They put in the fine print that this is going to degrade fish habitat.
56:11
They’d said it.
56:11
So, yeah,
56:17
the Thomas Report, the agencies, I believe, felt was moderately
56:20
under their control, but this [Gang of Four and process afterwards]
56:22
was totally out of their control.
56:24
They did not like that, did they?
56:26
No, and I can understand why.
56:29
It’s only when basically, a bureaucracy and the agency
56:34
people, just run out of gas.
56:36
They don’t have the answer.
56:38
Eventually, they have to give up and bring in other groups.
56:43
That’s what happened here.
56:46
What is interesting is that
56:51
we never got, I would challenge you to find any congressional
56:55
criticism of this report.
57:00
The Northwest delegation of Republicans and Democrats said, we asked you, and you
57:04
told us, but the price is too high for us to allow legislation to pass on this.
57:16
In the end,
57:20
two proposals, one in Agriculture [Alternatives 8 and 8A]
57:26
, and one in Interior they kicked around, 12A.
57:32
The numbers were not very different from where the Northwest Forest Plan ended.
57:35
And now are you talking about numbers in terms of how many late successional
57:39
old-growth forests would remain in reserve
57:44
areas?
57:45
Yes, how much is in reserve, how wide the buffers will be, and all of that.
57:49
And then, what would be “Matrix” lands?
57:50
[From NWFP zoning scheme]
57:50
Yeah.
57:51
Those terms were already ones that would come out in FEMAT
57:54
and the Northwest Forest Plan.
57:55
The terms were already being bandied around?
57:57
They were, and they came by and large from the Thomas Report, and were
58:04
modified by this report [Gang of Four]
58:07
. “Adaptive Management Areas,” also.
58:09
They came later.
58:10
[Northwest Forest Plan zoning category]
58:10
Later, that’s what I thought.
58:12
There were no adaptive management areas in this.
58:14
There were none in this.
58:15
But the “matrix” came out of the Thomas Report, late successional
58:17
[reserves] came out of this report. And so, what happened is that what was
58:23
interesting about this report, is that
58:29
we would not tell anyone. Jim Lyons called up and wanted to
58:32
know what’s going to be in it.
58:33
And I said, “We’re not telling you.”
58:36
We worked day and night up at the OSU Center, and some people joined us.
58:41
All the maps were hand-drawn.
58:42
There was no GIS to speak of.
58:44
We had no agency support.
58:46
We had no money.
58:47
We had nothing.
58:49
The
58:56
OSU Center, I get for free because I’m faculty.
59:00
So, we did that, and
59:06
Congress,
59:11
they didn’t criticize us.
59:15
But people like Congressman DeFazio were devastated at the results here.
59:20
Of this?
59:21
Yeah.
59:21
Why was DeFazio devastated?
59:23
Because it meant, that for any reasonable hope of survival for these
59:29
species and ecosystems, there was going to be a dramatic fall in harvest.
59:34
And he recognized how that would affect the politics, the economics.
59:38
He recognized how that would affect his district.
59:39
Yes, that’s what I meant.
59:41
I mean, he goes from Lane County and up here a little bit, but all
59:44
the way down to Douglas and south.
59:49
But he never challenged us.
59:51
It was a different era.
59:55
We were kind of the wise men of the village, and they hired us to tell
59:58
them the way things were, and we did.
59:59
And then, John, as I think Jerry probably mentioned to you, John Gordon had the
1:00:05
masterstroke of summarizing it for us.
1:00:12
In Congress, you mean?
1:00:12
Yeah, with this.
1:00:14
Right.
1:00:17
There’s lots of maybe funny stories, but I’ll just tell one of them.
1:00:20
That’s fine.
1:00:21
The stories are a part of this process.
1:00:23
This, he gave me this.
1:00:25
Okay.
1:00:29
But what was key was this last statement.
1:00:33
And so, let me just say, that we’d written something John didn’t like.
1:00:39
He went off to write his own.
1:00:41
We said, “Okay, John, what should we do?” Because he had been away
1:00:45
for a bit, and he hadn’t been at the final days back at Portland.
1:00:51
He
1:00:54
was back at Yale, the Dean of the College of Forestry?
1:00:56
No, actually, he was in Finland with his wife on vacation.
1:00:59
Oh, okay.
1:00:59
But
1:01:01
[laughs], he spends a lot of time in Finland.
1:01:03
Yeah, I know, he told me about that, too.
1:01:05
Did you interview him?
1:01:06
Yes, I did.
1:01:06
Up in Benson Towers, where he lives in Portland.
1:01:09
And
1:01:12
so, we’d written something that he didn’t think too much of, and I agreed,
1:01:15
it didn’t amount to much as a report.
1:01:17
So we said, “What should we do?
1:01:19
It’s the night before the presentation.” “Well, I’ll
1:01:21
[Gordon] go write something.” And
1:01:25
he wrote this.
1:01:26
Franklin then said, “This is corny, especially this phrase I’m going
1:01:30
to read you.” Franklin rewrote it.
1:01:31
Luckily, Gordon paid no attention to the rewrite.
1:01:34
He just wrote what he did and read it.
1:01:36
He said
1:01:40
that
1:01:43
current forest plans provided a high level of assurance for maintaining habitat for
1:01:47
dependent species, and projected harvest levels of the state can be achieved.
1:01:53
We’d described again a practical ecosystem approach to
1:01:56
conserving biological diversity.
1:01:59
But then he said the punch line, “We’ve provided a sound basis for decisions,
1:02:04
given the time and information in which we operated. Science, at least as exemplified
1:02:08
by the four of us and those who assisted us, has done what it can. The process
1:02:13
of democracy must go forward from here.”
1:02:19
Congress realized we were just workers handing things off to them, and were not
1:02:23
trying to make the decision for them.
1:02:25
They really appreciated that.
1:02:27
But they did not do anything final with this.
1:02:31
Correct?
1:02:31
Oh, let me just backtrack and say—
1:02:34
They passed the buck, but anyway.
1:02:36
That particular meeting with Congress was one of the few times congressmen came
1:02:42
to a briefing as opposed to their staff.
1:02:45
They came to hear it.
1:02:47
And there was absolutely no knowledge even ten minutes before
1:02:51
of what we were going to say.
1:02:54
We had alerted no one.
1:02:56
I was in charge of the information.
1:02:58
I had congressmen coming in, trying to hang out and look over my shoulder,
1:03:02
and I told them, “No, you can’t see it.” Well, I didn’t work for them, I
1:03:06
mean, what are they going to do to me?
1:03:08
[Laughs] At any rate, but
1:03:14
the two committees, and now Interior was sponsored as two
1:03:18
and Ag, they developed proposals.
1:03:24
They actually voted on them.
1:03:28
The Speaker of the House was Tom Foley from
1:03:31
— Washington?
1:03:32
He would not allow them to come to the floor for a vote.
1:03:37
Because?
1:03:39
He didn’t want a vote.
1:03:40
He did not like the answers.
1:03:43
Because he recognized that it would impact—
1:03:46
Yeah.
1:03:46
The timber industry in his home state?
1:03:48
Well, he’d been talked to by the industry.
1:03:54
However, it’s also true that
1:04:08
with this report piled on the Thomas Report, there was no going back.
1:04:13
There was no going back.
1:04:15
Now, did you guys received pressure from the timber industry?
1:04:19
Pressure?
1:04:20
Or input or contact?
1:04:22
Oh, yeah, at the beginning of it.
1:04:24
I mean, however you interpret that?
1:04:26
No, and let me tell you, not much.
1:04:27
At the beginning, the industry was hanging around the Coliseum, too, and acted upset.
1:04:32
But, no.
1:04:34
Let me tell you why.
1:04:36
They didn’t believe anyone would take this seriously.
1:04:40
These guys worked for six weeks and they’re overturning something
1:04:42
that took fourteen years, what are you talking about?
1:04:45
And when you mean fourteen years, you’re talking about—
1:04:47
The forest planning efforts.
1:04:48
1976 to ’89 or ’90.
1:04:49
[Post-NFMA of 1976 planning dynamics]
1:04:50
Yeah.
1:04:50
When they’d basically been working on these the whole time.
1:04:52
Yeah.
1:04:53
Okay.
1:04:53
And so, I believe, they didn’t think anyone would take it seriously.
1:04:58
They took this very seriously.
1:04:59
And after that, after that, it was sort of downhill sledding
1:05:04
to the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:05:06
The big change happened between the Thomas Report and the Gang of
1:05:09
Four, from a political standpoint of a sense of what was possible.
1:05:14
And how would you characterize the political shift, whether it be out
1:05:18
here amongst the citizenry, and also in the powers of Congress and
1:05:23
the state governments and the like?
1:05:24
How would you characterize that shift?
1:05:28
The shift was that the realization, as John Gordon said here,
1:05:39
“There’s no alternative that provides abundant timber harvest and high
1:05:42
levels of habitat protection. There’s no alternative that does that.
1:05:46
You can’t have them both.” And it was clear where the law was.
1:05:53
So, if you’re not going to overturn these environmental laws, you’re going to
1:05:57
have a tremendous reduction in harvest.
1:05:59
And there’s no way out.
1:06:03
Now, when you were involved with the process that produced this report,
1:06:08
the hearing, did you perceive the size of the challenge ahead when you
1:06:15
were first getting involved in this?
1:06:18
And whether or not you did, when did you realize that this was really a big deal?
1:06:29
I realized it when I
1:06:35
calculated the harvest levels with the different options, and
1:06:42
realized that we went all the way from the low “L” to the “H” high.
1:06:48
There was “Low to Medium,” but there was
1:06:58
no option with “L’s,” [Low] for some aspect of the environment,
1:07:05
low levels of protection,
1:07:11
that didn’t have harvest levels about a third of historical levels.
1:07:18
I remember sitting with a friend who was helping do the calculations up at the
1:07:24
regional office, and I realized that.
1:07:28
And
1:07:32
you know, that was it.
1:07:37
I expected there was no coming back from that.
1:07:40
That’s when I realized that the world had changed, and the way
1:07:45
of thinking about it had changed.
1:07:50
My goal at the time was to get to the bottom line as rapidly
1:07:54
as possible, because all this uncertainty was killing everyone.
1:07:57
And this is still before FEMAT?
1:07:59
Yeah.
1:08:01
Did you realize that even changing the parameters of your career in terms of your
1:08:06
specialty as a forest economist, did you say, okay, I’ve got to now start including
1:08:11
all these other variables in terms of what society, but also the law, will
1:08:16
accept as legal and doable and acceptable?
1:08:20
That was kind of the end of my career as a forest economist and the
1:08:23
beginning of my career such as it is, as somebody in planning and policy,
1:08:28
because you can’t separate them, whereas it once seemed like we could.
1:08:34
So
1:08:39
then, nothing really happens.
1:08:41
You’ve got the injunctions, and Bush I leaves office.
1:08:46
Clinton campaigns that he’s going to take care of this, and he actually does.
1:08:53
During the first two to three months of his administration,
1:08:55
he had the Forest Summit.
1:08:57
Now, were you at that summit?
1:08:58
No.
1:08:59
I wasn’t at that summit.
1:09:06
I was the only member of the Gang of Four not speaking.
1:09:13
I had the tradeoffs.
1:09:16
I would have presented the tradeoffs, and they didn’t
1:09:19
want to see them at the summit.
1:09:21
They thought it would be too discouraging for everyone.
1:09:25
So, they wanted to see kind of a simple version of what?
1:09:29
Talk about the issues and they wanted upbeat and optimistic,
1:09:33
and since the President’s involved, we can’t have bad news.
1:09:36
Yeah.
1:09:38
Wasn’t the whole cabinet there, or most of them?
1:09:40
Yeah, right, and I would come in and showed them, look, this is
1:09:42
the way it is, and then that would have blown the meeting apart.
1:09:46
Been a downer, right?
1:09:47
Yeah.
1:09:49
So, how would you have told them, if you were invited, what would you have said?
1:09:53
Give me a one-paragraph synopsis.
1:09:56
John Gordon brought along our key slide for his presentation, and
1:10:01
they wouldn’t let him show it.
1:10:04
Because of the same concerns?
1:10:05
[Johnson agrees] Okay.
1:10:05
Yeah.
1:10:09
So, I would have shown them what we found, and I had a neat little
1:10:12
summary, one-page summary, just a graph, a very powerful graphic,
1:10:16
and I would have showed them that.
1:10:19
So, this is where we are now, so here’s some choices.
1:10:25
[Laughs]
1:10:26
Now, was that a fair predictor of some of the economic tradeoffs?
1:10:33
Oh, totally.
1:10:34
They’re pretty much unchanged.
1:10:36
Now, did you predict the, shall we say, and I’m using a nice word,
1:10:41
the “disappointing” timber harvests under the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:10:45
Yeah, well, we
1:10:46
— Did you see that coming?
1:10:48
Yeah, that was 1.2 billion [board feet] . That’s where it ended up.
1:10:51
So, you figured that was going to happen?
1:10:52
Yeah.
1:10:57
I was sure of it by that time.
1:11:01
Now this, you mean, by the time of FEMAT?
1:11:02
] Johnson: By the time of the Timber Summit , by the end of the Gang
1:11:08
of Four , and the reaction of the delegation to it, especially, I was
1:11:16
convinced as to where we were headed.
1:11:18
It
1:11:21
was one of the options that Congress was going to consider till Foley stopped them.
1:11:26
I don’t mean to say I’m a know-it-all.
1:11:29
I don’t mean that.
1:11:30
But it was clear that the party was over, if it was a party, and the
1:11:39
harvest levels were going to fall precipitously.
1:11:43
Independent of the formal plan?
1:11:48
No.
1:11:48
Or because of the formal planning dynamic?
1:11:50
Well, by this time,
1:11:54
there was an injunction on harvests in northern spotted owl habitat.
1:11:57
And so, in terms of getting a release of that injunction, and also dealing with the
1:12:03
fish issues, I knew where that was headed.
1:12:06
It wasn’t a mystery any more.
1:12:09
And it wasn’t a mystery to any of us involved.
1:12:14
Now, coming from a traditional forest economics perspective, how did you
1:12:19
see the other ways that people valued old-growth late-successional forests,
1:12:26
seeing them as churches, as sacred spaces, as things that you heard about.
1:12:32
I mean, you read poetry from some of the early American history, John Muir, and
1:12:36
all that stuff that was out there, but it wasn’t a broadly-held popular cultural
1:12:41
thing, and how did you see the values entering into how forests had to be
1:12:47
assessed from, let’s say, Earth Day on?
1:12:50
But let me just say, that that is not what we were asked to do.
1:12:54
No.
1:12:54
Nor not what we did.
1:12:57
We had a very specific assignment which is captured here, but it’s the same
1:13:03
one in the wonderful words of those for FEMAT, but about evaluating a different
1:13:11
approach to protecting ecological old growth and late successional ecosystems
1:13:13
and species and processes, including, but not confined, to the spotted owls.
1:13:20
We were not asked in any way to consider the emotional attachment
1:13:24
people have to forests in the Gang of Four report or in FEMAT.
1:13:30
Now, that was a flaw.
1:13:32
I’m asking you personally.
1:13:33
Oh.
1:13:35
I understand what was in the reports, I’m just asking you personally
1:13:39
as a forest economist who evolved over time as society is evolving.
1:13:43
Oh, yeah, okay.
1:13:43
Sorry, I should have made it more clear about that, because
1:13:45
we are mired in this stuff.
1:13:47
But just personally, how did that perception come to you, as you said,
1:13:51
wow, these other values are, all of a sudden, a much bigger deal than
1:13:56
they were when I was first trained?
1:13:57
In ’87, as Franklin may have told you, he came into my office.
1:14:01
I didn’t know him well.
1:14:05
And by that time,
1:14:09
I’d realized that the old-growth trees and forests are very special.
1:14:13
I said to him, “Jerry, we just have to find a way to reserve the
1:14:17
rest of the old-growth.” And he thought I was crazy. I don’t know
1:14:23
whether he mentioned this to you.
1:14:24
He tells the story often, and said that we can’t do that.
1:14:28
I said, “No,
1:14:31
these forests are something different. And we need to find a way
1:14:35
to reserve them, because they have value way beyond timber.” So, yeah.
1:14:43
So, you came to that realization even before Jerry, the “guru” of old
1:14:48
growth, came to that realization?
1:14:49
Is that fair to say?
1:14:50
Yeah.
1:14:50
Although he knew about their importance before I did in all these ways.
1:14:58
He just did not think it was possible to reserve them.
1:15:02
And then the Times did a story on me
1:15:08
that ended up on the front page of the local paper.
1:15:13
The Gazette-Times?
1:15:13
[Corvallis newspaper]
1:15:14
Yeah.
1:15:14
Okay.
1:15:16
That said, here’s a guy that spent his life thinking that sustained-yield
1:15:20
would sustain all the forest values, and now he’s realized it won’t.
1:15:24
It was during that period.
1:15:26
Was that, I don’t want to call it……was that like a crisis for you, or a
1:15:33
moment of consciousness-shifting?
1:15:36
Yeah, I’ll say.
1:15:37
I mean, what went on?
1:15:39
Do you remember about how you were reflecting on what you were and how you
1:15:43
were trained, and all of a sudden you say, “Wow, I’ve got to really rethink
1:15:48
my whole perspective on what I do?”
1:15:51
Yeah.
1:15:53
It hasn’t been real stable since.
1:15:57
[Laughs]
1:15:57
And you’re on a wobbly chair right now.
1:16:01
[Laughs]
1:16:01
Yes, it certainly did change the way I think.
1:16:07
Also, the realization that there are
1:16:11
a lot of
1:16:15
concepts needed now to manage forests that I was not an expert on.
1:16:21
So, how did you become conversant with the disciplines of the quote, “ologists” in
1:16:28
all these other earth science areas, so you could merge what you were good at and
1:16:34
trained in, and integrate that into more, shall we say, a progressive, post-modern
1:16:40
forest planning and policy perspective?
1:16:46
Well, I’m not sure I entirely have, actually.
1:16:50
But
1:16:54
the Gang of Four report was a labor of love for all those who were involved.
1:16:58
How long did it take you guys to write this thing?
1:17:03
Well, I wrote it.
1:17:04
How long did it take you to write it?
1:17:07
We didn’t have it when we presented it.
1:17:08
It took me a few weeks.
1:17:10
Okay.
1:17:12
But it was a labor of love.
1:17:13
And so,
1:17:17
I learned a lot because all these people were so forthcoming, especially, Thomas
1:17:22
and Franklin and Sedell and Reeves.
1:17:28
We knew we were on an adventure and knew things were changing.
1:17:33
We knew that at last, they all could speak out on things that have
1:17:39
been pretty squashed to that point.
1:17:42
So, that was a very uplifting experience, and that made it easy to learn.
1:17:49
It did.
1:17:53
That was good stuff, and it was exhilarating
1:17:59
and they were very kind to me.
1:18:05
John Gordon was trained in physiology, and there were
1:18:11
biologists, ecologists, and aquatic scientists.
1:18:12
I was just
1:18:15
this guy with this other stuff.
1:18:17
We had a grand time.
1:18:18
But isn’t that what makes great collaborations, is that you complement
1:18:24
each other and you’re able to see the wisdom of other things, and
1:18:28
then come together with something that isn’t necessarily committed to
1:18:33
any one person’s perspective or one discipline or one person’s interest?
1:18:37
Yes.
1:18:41
And it was a lot different than FEMAT.
1:18:43
Right.
1:18:44
And so, we go from this to the Forest Summit.
1:18:47
Did you watch it on television?
1:18:50
I listened to it when it was on radio.
1:18:53
I didn’t go.
1:18:57
I spent the day with my dog out in the woods.
1:19:01
I did listen, sure.
1:19:03
And not too long after that, the charge was given for sixty days originally and
1:19:10
I believe people begged for thirty more, and the whole FEMAT “pink tower” event,
1:19:17
I jokingly call the “Slumber Party.”
1:19:20
Yeah.
1:19:20
Where people basically “camped out” and put together this gigantic
1:19:25
document, or the information that came into this gigantic document.
1:19:32
What do you remember about how that came together?
1:19:35
Well,
1:19:48
Jack Ward Thomas
1:19:52
knew before the summit he was going to be asked.
1:19:56
And he got me together with him,
1:20:00
and I really believe this is before the summit, to outline who would
1:20:03
be involved, and who we would get.
1:20:15
Some of the people from the owl study didn’t want Franklin involved.
1:20:20
Was there a particular reason?
1:20:22
Yeah, they thought he was too powerful of an individual.
1:20:27
And Jerry is a presence, isn’t he?
1:20:28
Yeah.
1:20:30
And Jack and I actually
1:20:36
spent a lot of time together working on who would be involved.
1:20:41
Before it, the Gang of Four didn’t know Jack well, but afterwards, he
1:20:44
had a fair amount of trust in the end.
1:20:45
He was a fairly strong personality, as well.
1:20:47
I never met him, but know he was.
1:20:50
Yeah, he was.
1:20:51
And Franklin and he, kind of at times, clashed.
1:20:56
At any rate, I was sort of the grease between the two giant wheels.
1:21:03
[Laughs] Okay.
1:21:06
And so—
1:21:10
Now, John [Gordon] , was he involved in the FEMAT?
1:21:13
Not at all, he had broken his leg.
1:21:15
Okay.
1:21:16
He was back, but he was not involved at all.
1:21:17
Yeah, he told me he wasn’t.
1:21:20
He didn’t tell me he broke his leg, though.
1:21:21
Yeah, he did break his leg, or Lyons would have had him out there.
1:21:30
But we came to a crucial point.
1:21:38
For the Gang of Four report, there were no managers involved.
1:21:42
They were somewhat prohibited.
1:21:44
It
1:21:46
was just the staffers.
1:21:48
I was told different things about both the FEMAT [meeting] , but also
1:21:51
the Gang of Four [meeting] at the [Memorial] Coliseum in Portland.
1:21:55
For the record, both of them took place in Portland.
1:21:58
The Gang of Four, shall we say, the planning symposium, took place in,
1:22:04
shall we say, the exterior halls and rooms in Memorial Coliseum in Portland?
1:22:08
For one week.
1:22:09
And then for four weeks in the OSU Center [Portland]
1:22:14
. Okay, so there was two separate events.
1:22:16
Because the week in the Coliseum,
1:22:23
six days, were spent mapping.
1:22:27
Okay.
1:22:28
Basically, you were compiling all the known information in maps, and trying
1:22:34
to come up with a collaborative median series of maps that took the best of all
1:22:40
information and made the most complete?
1:22:42
Actually, mainly, we used the expert judgment and knowledge
1:22:47
of all the different specialists from the national forests [in
1:22:52
Northwest] . That was the first time they’d ever been asked to do that.
1:22:54
Okay.
1:22:56
And then, we spent many weeks in the OSU Center, in which we were doing—
1:23:01
That’s here in Corvallis?
1:23:02
No, it’s at Portland.
1:23:04
Oh, the OSU Center, okay.
1:23:05
Sorry, I didn’t make that clear.
1:23:06
Not your fault.
1:23:07
No, that’s fine, okay.
1:23:08
Yeah, it’s in Portland.
1:23:15
And
1:23:19
when we did this—we developed alternatives, because we had maps.
1:23:24
We developed alternatives, did risk analysis, did harvest calculations.
1:23:29
Now,
1:23:37
I don’t know where we were going with that.
1:23:39
Well, the reason I brought it up is I wanted it for the sake of
1:23:42
--- Oh, now I know, yeah.
1:23:44
-- For the sake of interesting anecdotes, really, how people that were managers
1:23:50
or presences or political personalities, were not supposed to be in the meeting
1:23:56
rooms where people were putting all the stuff together, and that they
1:24:00
even had to wear like special badges and reflectors, almost like they were
1:24:04
traffic cones walking through the room?
1:24:07
Yeah, they did that.
1:24:09
We were trying to “break the cord” of the managers in controlling what the
1:24:13
specialists said. By and large, it was successful, and sometimes it wasn’t.
1:24:18
And when we found out that still they would not identify any old-growth groves
1:24:23
except those outside current timber sales.
1:24:27
You knew they were under pressure from above.
1:24:29
Yeah.
1:24:29
And they weren’t being able to really “speak freely,” in other words?
1:24:34
Well, not very well-known or known at all, is that I took possession of the maps, and
1:24:42
they were in the basement of Peavy Hall.
1:24:45
And I would let specialists in at night secretly to redraw them.
1:24:55
Subterfuge.
1:24:56
[Laughs]
1:24:57
And a couple forests, of which Siuslaw and Deschutes were two
1:25:02
of them, we had to redraw them.
1:25:05
What was wrong with them?
1:25:06
They wouldn’t identify old growth that wasn’t in existing timber sales.
1:25:09
Right.
1:25:10
Or proposed.
1:25:11
They were afraid of being reprimanded by their bosses, right?
1:25:13
Yeah, these were sales that hadn’t been sold, but they were in planning.
1:25:17
So, that would go along with what I’ve heard about, and they said it for the
1:25:22
record, so I guess it safe for me to kind of encapsule the experience, is
1:25:28
that when the Gang of Four, actually the committee hearings leading up to the
1:25:34
report, that involved the Gang of Four, a
1:25:38
couple of the people, specifically Gordon Reeves and Jim Sedell, but Gordie, I
1:25:43
think, in particular, who was fairly young in this group at that time.
1:25:47
Yeah.
1:25:47
Was actually, kind of read the “riot act,” by some people [USFS] above.
1:25:52
Yeah, yeah.
1:25:53
And I guess that some Congressional people came to his aid because he was
1:25:57
concerned because of what he said, because basically the fish and the water issues
1:26:03
complicated the situation, to where, my God, I guess [Dale] Robertson and some of
1:26:08
the top people got unhappy, shall we say?
1:26:11
I’m putting a nice word on it, but they were not pleased.
1:26:14
No.
1:26:15
Would that be fair?
1:26:16
And that’s a good example of what you’re talking about, right?
1:26:19
Yeah, Thomas, and especially Reeves and Sedell, were in the Forest Service.
1:26:27
They were subject to this dismay and sanction.
1:26:34
Franklin and I were in the university and they couldn’t do a damn thing to us.
1:26:39
That is, from the Forest Service.
1:26:41
Now, it’s true that my dean sure heard about it from the industry.
1:26:44
But my dean George Brown, protected me famously.
1:26:48
He never even mentioned it once.
1:26:51
There’s one story you ought to know is that George—well, he never once came
1:26:59
to me and yelled at me for the Gang of Four, and yet, he got yelled at a lot.
1:27:04
He was a great dean.
1:27:07
Continuing along that line.
1:27:09
But yeah, so there I was.
1:27:12
And this was, I mean, what’s going on here?
1:27:15
I mean, things are totally out of control.
1:27:17
The Forest Service had never experienced this before.
1:27:20
BLM had never experienced it.
1:27:22
Where basically, the keys to the kingdom were being handed over to a group of
1:27:29
biologists, ecologists, scientists, and everybody else was pushed aside.
1:27:36
And
1:27:44
so, I was involved deeply with Jack in setting up the teams for FEMAT.
1:27:52
That’s right, we were on that, okay.
1:27:55
And
1:27:58
the question was whether to have managers on the team.
1:28:03
And the conclusion was?
1:28:06
I didn’t know how that would work because they were so committed
1:28:10
to their timber sale program.
1:28:11
So, you were once again, the same dynamic you’ve been talking about
1:28:14
for a while, just in that new forum?
1:28:16
Yeah, but that one was done behind the scenes, and they
1:28:20
just didn’t end up on the teams.
1:28:23
And so that continued the freedom of thought.
1:28:26
It also had the downside of
1:28:32
complicating the realism of the plan,
1:28:39
because they weren’t heavily involved in crafting it, and also, complicating
1:28:44
their commitment to it because they weren’t involved in crafting it.
1:28:49
So, okay, let’s just go to the FEMAT process.
1:28:57
Okay, the team is chosen.
1:28:59
Jack and you are the head planning people, right?
1:29:02
Well, no.
1:29:03
A lot of people were involved, but I was just
1:29:09
at one stage in process.
1:29:12
He [Thomas] came to me and we talked it through, and he
1:29:14
talked to a lot of other people.
1:29:15
I don’t mean to say I was the only one involved.
1:29:17
But it did get set up.
1:29:22
Marty [Raphael] was to be head of the ecological and biological, and I was going
1:29:26
to be head of the economic and social.
1:29:28
Marty Raphael, correct?
1:29:29
Yeah, but the PNW Station people really complained about that.
1:29:38
I had to calculate harvest levels, because that’s where things
1:29:42
turned, in terms of the interest by
1:29:52
the Clinton administration.
1:29:56
They wanted to take care of all the species, but they had commitments to the
1:30:03
other entities.
1:30:05
I really focused on the harvest levels, working with the
1:30:09
Forest Service and the BLM.
1:30:12
There were representatives of both, we had a team, and we worked on harvest levels.
1:30:17
I could talk to you more about that
1:30:21
later.
1:30:21
They chose a place, the “Pink Tower.”
1:30:24
Yep, the 32nd Floor.
1:30:27
What’s that?
1:30:28
32nd Floor.
1:30:28
32nd Floor of the Bank of America building?
1:30:32
Or no, it’s
1:30:35
the
1:30:35
- ? U.S. Bank.
1:30:36
U.S. Bank building in downtown Portland.
1:30:39
And everybody’s basically called in.
1:30:42
How many people, 175 total that were involved?
1:30:45
Oh, I think there were a couple hundred involved.
1:30:47
But some only came
1:30:51
when needed.
1:30:51
There was a core team that was there all the time.
1:30:54
But then, when they called in people for risk assessment and
1:30:57
review, there were other people that joined up for short periods.
1:31:01
Yeah, absolutely.
1:31:04
So what happened then, on day one?
1:31:06
You were given a sixty-day window that fortunately got stretched to ninety days,
1:31:11
because you just couldn’t get it done?
1:31:13
Well, no, no.
1:31:13
No, no.
1:31:15
We got it done.
1:31:16
The Clinton administration didn’t like the answer.
1:31:18
Oh, so they asked for more alternatives?
1:31:20
They asked for something better.
1:31:22
And they were given the— [report] —we reported to them in the Indian Treaty Room
1:31:28
back in the old executive office building that is on the White House grounds.
1:31:34
This is jumping ahead, I’ll just say this.
1:31:36
That’s fine.
1:31:36
That
1:31:42
again, to achieve something with no L’s [low ratings] in it, the level
1:31:49
of protection they were after, they didn’t get the harvest levels they
1:31:52
wanted, and there was kind of a magic [number] of about a billion board-feet.
1:31:56
And so, Franklin, and some others, Sedell, and maybe me, thought there
1:32:04
could be more integrated alternatives.
1:32:05
So, we presented the alternatives, and there was a lot of pushing and shoving.
1:32:11
FEMAT was not the friendly environment of the Gang of Four.
1:32:17
It was really
1:32:20
pretty contentious among all the scientists.
1:32:25
So, going back to day one.
1:32:29
I kind of leaped ahead and you were responding to my concluding
1:32:33
comment in that question.
1:32:36
You’re given sixty days.
1:32:39
What happened on day one, and how did you guys pull it together
1:32:42
as people started coming in?
1:32:44
Characterize the atmosphere of how the place was divided up, how the teams
1:32:48
worked together or didn’t work together, collaborated, fought, etc. Just tell
1:32:54
me that story as best you remember.
1:32:58
You had your specialty, but were involved in the whole thing.
1:33:01
Yeah.
1:33:05
The teams didn’t work much together.
1:33:09
The social scientists didn’t work much with the economists.
1:33:12
The aquatic people didn’t work much with the wildlife people.
1:33:15
As Jack used to say, it just kind of all clicked together at the end.
1:33:20
So, it very much it was tribal, very tribal.
1:33:23
And there was
1:33:26
the people that had put together the owl plan.
1:33:29
I don’t know if you have it here, the ISC report?
1:33:32
I’ve got one of the owl plans here.
1:33:34
I’ve just got the ’88 one, I believe, just for the sake of discussion.
1:33:38
No, the ISC, you know, there’s—
1:33:40
I’ve got this one.
1:33:42
I just bring this one along for a prop.
1:33:44
Yeah.
1:33:44
This was the ’85 one, actually, an early one.
1:33:48
Let me just tell you as an aside.
1:33:51
The ISC report really ushered in this monumental change, and
1:33:59
it’s a wonderful piece of work.
1:34:02
Yeah, I’ve got it on a pdf.
1:34:04
It’s really wonderful.
1:34:06
It really is a wonderful piece of work.
1:34:11
But the folks that put that together were pretty defensive about that’s
1:34:14
what we ought to have as the plan.
1:34:15
And thus—
1:34:16
Like a plan, a singular plan?
1:34:18
Well, just that that’s the one we really want here.
1:34:27
How would that have allowed for more or less timber harvest, for instance?
1:34:32
Well, it’s kind of funny here.
1:34:44
It was as much a planning philosophy, and it’s a little hard for me to
1:34:48
explain when I’m really thinking about it, and who was in charge.
1:34:52
There were battles over who’s in charge, and whose way of thinking
1:34:57
about things, was in charge.
1:34:58
Are we going with FEMAT now?
1:35:00
FEMAT.
1:35:00
Okay, got you.
1:35:02
Is it the wildlife biologist?
1:35:04
Is it the landscape ecologist?
1:35:06
Do the social people have any say in how we shape things?
1:35:09
Who is to shape the alternatives?
1:35:10
How do you shape them?
1:35:11
Those were the real arguments at the beginning.
1:35:13
What’s the role of the aquatic?
1:35:14
Yeah.
1:35:15
How big are the buffers going to be?
1:35:17
How are they going to relate to the—
1:35:17
Well, it wasn’t there yet.
1:35:21
It was whose way of thinking about things.
1:35:26
And the landscape ecologists think differently than the spotted owl folks.
1:35:31
We tend to emphasize structure, and the aquatic people emphasize process.
1:35:36
The social scientists have a whole different approach than the economists.
1:35:40
There was a real battle about who was in charge, and that went
1:35:44
all the way through the thing.
1:35:45
We didn’t have that battle with the Gang of Four.
1:35:48
How was that reflected in the final report here in terms of FEMAT, and from
1:35:53
what you say, the lack of unanimity and agreement on certain things?
1:36:00
Well—
1:36:04
It’s hard to get that from reading this master document unless you were
1:36:06
involved and you did the whole thing.
1:36:07
That’s why I’m asking you?
1:36:10
Yeah.
1:36:17
As an example,
1:36:25
the landscape ecologists wanted what they called an ecosystem plan, and so did Jack.
1:36:29
And the wildlife biologists, many of them wanted a very specific plan
1:36:34
for each species, and that’s how we ended up with “Survey and Manage.”
1:36:37
[Implementation policy added to NWFP after FEMAT was accepted] They didn’t agree.
1:36:40
So, the “coarse-filter” versus the “fine-filter” approach?
1:36:43
Yeah, exactly.
1:36:51
Exactly.
1:36:51
It was like
1:36:54
a five-sided star, or five-sided boxing ring.
1:36:59
And
1:37:02
the social scientists and economists had different views, too, like what
1:37:05
parts of the landscape are in trouble economically, and which aren’t.
1:37:09
So, a lot of this was not well-integrated.
1:37:14
We were trying to hold onto things by our fingertips to understand what
1:37:19
everybody was saying so we could model it.
1:37:22
By the way, there is another report on timber harvest scheduling you don’t have.
1:37:26
That was the report on the timber side of it that actually didn’t get
1:37:30
into FEMAT because it couldn’t be done until they’d finished their model.
1:37:33
Is that one that you wrote?
1:37:33
Yes.
1:37:37
We couldn’t develop harvest numbers until we got the alternatives
1:37:42
and what they meant, which meant, we had to sort of have that.
1:37:45
In other words, the maps and reserves, and how they all interlocked together?
1:37:50
Not only that, but what are the prescriptions you can
1:37:52
have and what can’t you have.
1:37:54
Yeah, what can happen on a later successional, what could happen on a
1:37:56
Matrix, what could happen on AMA’s, etc.?
1:37:57
Yes, yes.
1:37:57
And how they interlocked and
1:38:02
also you have the relationship of Forest Service lands with BLM lands.
1:38:05
And then we’re not even talking about Oregon and Washington
1:38:08
forest lands [state-owned]
1:38:08
. Yeah.
1:38:09
By the way, I forgot to ask you earlier.
1:38:11
How would you characterize the difference between cultures in
1:38:14
Oregon and Washington vis-à-vis forested lands, timber resources,
1:38:22
from the state perspective, mainly?
1:38:26
From the perspective of people in state government, do you mean?
1:38:29
Yes, or even
1:38:31
the cultures of the states.
1:38:32
I mean, Jerry has very strong opinions about the difference between Oregon
1:38:37
and Washington, and I just wonder what your view on that whole thing was?
1:38:45
Well,
1:38:52
I doubt Franklin and I agree on that, but we’ve never talked about it.
1:38:59
Oregon doesn’t have that much really high elevation forests like the North Cascades.
1:39:06
It’s not near as amenable to classic definitions of a
1:39:08
national park or wilderness.
1:39:18
So, they’re different, geologically and geographically.
1:39:23
But within that context, it’s true that timber has had a larger role
1:39:32
in shaping state politics on the national forests, in Oregon.
1:39:38
In Oregon, okay.
1:39:40
Timber companies, like Weyerhaeuser, have had
1:39:47
a major effect on shaping policy in Washington.
1:39:49
Here [Oregon]
1:39:52
, we don’t have a dominant state or private owner.
1:39:56
So, there have been a lot of differences,
1:40:02
and what’s throwing me here is much of this
1:40:08
perspective didn’t come from state government.
1:40:11
State government’s been largely insignificant and uninvolved
1:40:16
in federal forest policy.
1:40:17
It’s been our delegation.
1:40:19
[Congress]
1:40:19
Right.
1:40:20
That was very powerful and positioned and focused on timber.
1:40:24
So, it really is the difference in the congressional delegations, I
1:40:26
think more than state government.
1:40:28
Now, I was just trying to relate to what I remember Jerry talking about.
1:40:31
Yeah, so I think that our politicians in Congress, when it was a regional
1:40:38
issue, they were in the lead.
1:40:40
It was partly their positions of seniority.
1:40:43
I’m not sure the politicians in Washington would have done it
1:40:45
differently, but they weren’t in the positions of power during this time.
1:40:49
How would you characterize the congressional delegations, and I haven’t
1:40:52
talked about this yet, of Oregon and Washington, leading up to and during
1:40:58
the Northwest Forest Plan process?
1:41:00
Maybe singling out one or two people that took leading roles
1:41:06
in pulling or pushing it through?
1:41:13
Well, they stood back.
1:41:14
They didn’t push it through.
1:41:16
None of them.
1:41:17
I mean, they stood back.
1:41:18
Once they got the Gang of Four report
1:41:22
and they saw there was no really easy solution, they said, “We’re
1:41:27
staying out of it,” and turned it over to the Clinton administration.
1:41:30
In other words, they didn’t see a “win-win” for them politically?
1:41:33
Correct.
1:41:35
That’s what really came out of the Gang of Four.
1:41:37
So, they stood back, and
1:41:45
as an example, for the only time in history, all nineteen members of both
1:41:51
congressional delegations, and including the governors of Oregon and Washington,
1:41:56
signed a joint-letter asking for a seminar on all of this, by us and some others.
1:42:02
So, they were unified in the value of the scientific involvement, pretty much.
1:42:08
They were unified in knowing they needed a solution, and they were also unified in
1:42:15
saying, “We’re not passing legislation.
1:42:17
It’s got to be administrative, because we can’t find enough of a sweet spot to do
1:42:25
anything.” So, they stood out of the way.
1:42:29
So, this letter you talked about, was that after this, but before FEMAT?
1:42:35
This letter?
1:42:36
No, no, not that letter, but the letter you’re talking
1:42:37
about, the nineteen signatories?
1:42:39
Oh, that was before.
1:42:39
That was after the Gang of Four, before FEMAT.
1:42:42
Okay, got you.
1:42:43
That was their, “Okay, educate us more.” We met up at the Red Lion in
1:42:48
Vancouver [Washington] with the staffers.
1:42:51
So, they still wanted to know about it, but they just stepped back.
1:42:57
They did not in any way harass us, though.
1:43:05
There was
1:43:07
a representative, one from Washington, near the Olympics, and he was pretty
1:43:13
powerful in the Corporation Committee.
1:43:14
He called me before
1:43:19
FEMAT, and his name was Norm, too.
1:43:21
I said, “Hey man, this is a bitter pill to swallow, but this is as good
1:43:25
as it gets.” He said, “Okay.” He didn’t see broad condemnation of FEMAT.
1:43:35
However,
1:43:41
there was a hearing on it in D.C. with three congressional committees.
1:43:51
If you want, I can talk to you about this now or later?
1:43:53
Oh,
1:43:59
go ahead.
1:44:00
I’m listening.
1:44:00
This is great.
1:44:00
Regarding the delegations, we leader had to go talk, and Brian Greber,
1:44:02
from OSU, did the economic analysis.
1:44:07
And we went to the hearing,
1:44:16
and now,
1:44:22
they’re in prime time.
1:44:25
They knew very well that this is going to have enormous employment impacts.
1:44:32
And Bob Smith and Congressman DeFazio really got after the employment
1:44:35
analysis, and Brian Greber on the fly, couldn’t really satisfy
1:44:40
their requests for information.
1:44:43
You’re talking about FEMAT and employment?
1:44:44
Yeah, okay.
1:44:45
Yes.
1:44:46
The economic/social part of it?
1:44:49
Finally, he calculated some enormous number of jobs you might say were
1:44:54
being lost, and they got really angry.
1:44:59
Congressman DeFazio got all these other people to defer to him,
1:45:04
and he was really on a tear.
1:45:07
And
1:45:10
he actually took the report and said, “We asked for a credible analysis and
1:45:15
you gave us an incredible analysis,” and threw the FEMAT report over his shoulder.
1:45:19
So, he threw it like against the wall or
1:45:23
-- ? Oh, just behind him like this [over the shoulder gesture]
1:45:24
. Oh, okay.
1:45:25
They were in tears.
1:45:26
I don’t know.
1:45:27
So, there was this coming out, that people were upset about the job
1:45:31
loss from our delegation, but that was when the spotlight was on them.
1:45:39
We were just left alone.
1:45:41
It was a political show just a little bit?
1:45:42
Yes, totally.
1:45:45
But it was honest and genuine, and so was he [DeFazio] . But
1:45:53
when we were doing FEMAT, there wasn’t a lot of political interference.
1:45:56
That’s what I’m getting at.
1:45:58
We didn’t hear from them.
1:45:59
Well, I think that’s what makes this a rather remarkable process is how two
1:46:06
parts of the whole process, the Gang of Four and FEMAT, took place in, I
1:46:13
don’t want to call it a vacuum, but a relative vacuum in terms of how these
1:46:17
things usually happen where you had meddlers from all sides, and of course,
1:46:22
in the post-NEPA era, the public.
1:46:24
Yeah.
1:46:24
You know, the environmentalists, “Joe Blow,” everybody was giving their
1:46:28
input, and you guys were basically in these little bubbles, temporarily.
1:46:32
That’s right.
1:46:34
That’s very unique in the post-NEPA era, anyway.
1:46:35
Yeah, it is.
1:46:38
In fact, I
1:46:42
just want to come back to that, because it was.
1:46:45
We were in what you’d call this bubble.
1:46:47
We were sequestered.
1:46:48
And none of the political leaders bothered us then, but when we surfaced again and
1:46:54
Congressman DeFazio could register his dismay and outrage, he certainly did.
1:46:58
But it was his district that was going to lose most of this employment.
1:47:01
It was devastating.
1:47:03
So, I’m not surprised he got upset.
1:47:04
And boy, if you couldn’t respond to his questions quickly,
1:47:08
he got madder and madder.
1:47:09
But it was in this public setting after things were pretty well set,
1:47:15
so it wasn’t going to change much.
1:47:19
As you may have learned, FEMAT
1:47:24
was successfully litigated by the industry over a FACA violation.
1:47:32
Which federal act is FACA?
1:47:35
Federal Advisory Committee Act.
1:47:39
Which basically means the lack of the involvement, the cloistered-fact
1:47:44
aspect, was basically attacked.
1:47:47
And then partly, because they were non-federal employees?
1:47:50
[Some of team were not]
1:47:51
Yes, because I was involved, as well as Franklin and others.
1:47:53
That’s what I meant.
1:47:54
Yeah,
1:47:57
it turned out the judge said, yes, the way this was developed was illegal.
1:48:02
However, he didn’t see how opening it up would have changed things now.
1:48:11
So, this stood?
1:48:13
Yeah.
1:48:15
Yeah, I remember hearing about the challenge.
1:48:16
Right.
1:48:17
Now, looking at the broader sweep of economics and timber, and forestry
1:48:25
and logging and timber harvest in the Northwest, there are many other factors
1:48:30
involved with how things played out over the ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s.
1:48:36
How would you characterize those other factors, whether it be foreign markets,
1:48:42
technology, etc., in terms of what would lead to the drop-off in timber harvest
1:48:49
in comparison to what this document and the Record of Decision [guidelines
1:48:55
for implementing NWFP] and all the guidelines would play out in terms
1:48:58
of limiting harvest on federal lands after the implementation of a plan?
1:49:04
You understand what I’m saying?
1:49:05
Sure.
1:49:05
The broad sweep of things.
1:49:07
Your interpretation is the comparative weighting of factors versus perception.
1:49:13
Well, a couple of things happened.
1:49:21
Certainly you can see it, and I showed my students, that in ’82 there was a
1:49:28
recession caused by high interest rates.
1:49:31
Then, when timber harvests came back in the mid to late-‘80s, the employment
1:49:37
didn’t come back near as much.
1:49:40
The industry used that time, really, there was a wind roaring
1:49:44
at the industry’s back, a shift to automation and all sorts of things.
1:49:47
So there already was a significant reduction of employment before we
1:49:52
— Before the injunction and any of that stuff ever happened.
1:49:56
Absolutely.
1:49:56
Secondly, and I’d have to look in detail, but the export market
1:50:02
picked up in Japan, and a lot of private timber was going to export.
1:50:06
So, there was a reduction in raw material here before this hit in terms
1:50:13
of what the mills can have available.
1:50:15
There were other forces at work, no doubt, that would have reduced the employment.
1:50:22
And
1:50:25
another thing that came out of FEMAT was the acknowledgement that
1:50:33
the regional economy here wasn’t near as dependent on timber as it used to be.
1:50:39
That came out of the analysis.
1:50:41
Now, it’s true that within the range of the northern spotted owl, which
1:50:45
was the focus of the analysis, you have Seattle and Portland, and all
1:50:49
these other areas, so there, it’s the classic urban/rural divide.
1:50:56
But when you look at it all, the regional economy has got to keep
1:51:00
going even if the federal timber harvest changed dramatically.
1:51:04
Once that was realized by the political leadership, I think it changed, it
1:51:10
altered, how much energy they were going to put into rehashing this.
1:51:14
You’re talking about after the [Northwest] Forest Plan was implemented?
1:51:18
When
1:51:21
it was being developed.
1:51:22
The notion about let’s repeal the ESA, or all this, no.
1:51:27
That would take enormous effort.
1:51:30
Things were changing anyway, and this was one of the factors.
1:51:34
But the regional economy was still growing.
1:51:38
And that’s a big deal.
1:51:39
Right.
1:51:40
It changes it from a regional economic problem to a local community economic
1:51:45
problem, and not just based on timber.
1:51:47
In other words, communities out there where the smaller mills
1:51:51
are, let’s say, withered away.
1:51:53
Part of the reason was, well, there was a lot of different factors.
1:51:56
But do you understand why a lot of these communities point to certain factors that
1:52:02
may or may not be correct, but they see the “ologists” and the environmentalists,
1:52:07
and all these people, as basically laying the hammer down on their way of life?
1:52:12
Well, yeah, yes!
1:52:15
I’d be right there with them if I was in their community, so, yeah.
1:52:21
On the other hand, this [NWFP, social changes] did contribute.
1:52:25
But there were a lot of other forces at work.
1:52:27
That was my point that I was trying to get to.
1:52:29
Yeah, there definitely is.
1:52:31
And
1:52:34
we have it on the charts I show in my class.
1:52:36
I just talked to students about this two weeks ago.
1:52:40
You can really see it.
1:52:45
Also, FEMAT did really emphasize this is just part of the timber supply base.
1:52:52
There are private lands.
1:52:54
And that
1:52:57
this is just a piece of the puzzle.
1:52:59
How do you feel that BLM vs.
1:53:02
Forest Service issues were addressed adequately in this plan, and
1:53:06
just during the whole process?
1:53:08
There were no BLM issues that were recognized.
1:53:10
No, I mean how did the BLM-Forest Service collaborate?
1:53:15
Well, I think I’m trying to say something else.
1:53:18
That’s what I meant to say.
1:53:19
Okay, go ahead.
1:53:20
What I’m trying to say is, BLM has a different organic act.
1:53:24
BLM is also not under the viability clause [to National Forest Management Act, which
1:53:28
affects Forest Service only] . They were treated just like the Forest Service.
1:53:31
We’re still trying to figure out what that means as of today, because they’re
1:53:35
not quite like the Forest Service, and they have a commitment to communities,
1:53:40
and their economic development the Forest Service doesn’t have in its organic act.
1:53:45
Alright.
1:53:45
So, they were treated as the same.
1:53:49
Even though they’re not the same?
1:53:50
Yeah, so that’s the first thing.
1:53:53
So, that provides political and legal and cultural oddities, shall we say?
1:53:59
Yeah, and we’re about to hit it again with the Trump administration.
1:54:02
We’re about to hit it again.
1:54:06
I’d like to close with that later near the end, but I want to ask you about
1:54:09
that because there’s a lot of concern out in the Forest Service, amongst
1:54:18
science people, and a lot of people, about what’s coming down the pike.
1:54:22
Yeah, but in terms of how they collaborated,
1:54:28
I think
1:54:33
that if we talk about the scientists involved, I think they worked well.
1:54:37
I don’t think there were these “tribes” based on specialty, and it wasn’t really
1:54:43
confounded much by Forest Service or BLM. The ISC had set the model where they
1:54:47
worked together fine. That really wasn’t a big deal; the Forest Service and BLM
1:54:53
scientists being separate, or thinking about things differently, or anything.
1:54:56
But don’t you think that this whole process, though, was
1:55:03
positive in the sense that two agencies that can be at loggerheads, were actually
1:55:10
forced to sit down in the same room over extended periods of time, planning
1:55:14
and writing, hashing out, and it put a different face on that relationship.
1:55:20
But the agencies didn’t sit down and write anything.
1:55:23
No, but I’m just saying the people did, though.
1:55:25
But that’s different.
1:55:26
And they weren’t the managers.
1:55:28
Okay.
1:55:29
So, you think that the stove-piping never really changed much in terms
1:55:33
of things at the top, though?
1:55:36
I’m not saying that.
1:55:37
I’m just trying to be accurate in what happened.
1:55:40
No, I know that.
1:55:41
I’m just trying to get us to frame this a little bit, and
1:55:44
see the different aspects of it.
1:55:46
I think there was much more of a cooperative spirit afterwards for a while.
1:55:51
That’s what I’ve heard, but it didn’t last forever.
1:55:54
No, it didn’t.
1:55:55
But for a while, it did.
1:55:57
It was unprecedented and did engage the agencies in an
1:56:02
ecosystem plan across boundaries.
1:56:04
It was great.
1:56:06
They caught that,
1:56:10
yeah.
1:56:11
And for a while it was wonderful.
1:56:13
But that’s not the natural order.
1:56:17
[Laughs] That takes continued energy.
1:56:19
Right, I know.
1:56:20
I mean, “turf” will return to “turf.”
1:56:23
Yeah, there you go, there you go.
1:56:25
It’s like the Beavers and the Ducks.
1:56:27
[Oregon sports rivalry] [Break in audio.] Anyway, we took a little break for a
1:56:33
minute, and we’re going to return to where we were with the FEMAT process.
1:56:37
And Norm’s just going to continue talking here, and we’ll pick it up from there.
1:56:45
Just a couple of things about this.
1:56:51
In terms of FEMAT, it was very tribal.
1:56:56
Occasionally, the “tribes” would come together, talk to each
1:56:59
other, then go back and work.
1:57:00
It was done multi-disciplinary as they say, not so much interdisciplinary.
1:57:08
The
1:57:13
crucial time came when we put together
1:57:22
an update, as the Clinton administration wanted one on where we were.
1:57:23
This is about six weeks into our supposed two-month period, maybe seven weeks.
1:57:29
So, you were close to the sixty-day deadline.
1:57:33
We went back to D.C. with alternatives we had developed, somewhat like the Gang
1:57:38
of Four alternatives, but a little more sophisticated, as they had different
1:57:42
kinds of reserve systems, differences in the extent and kinds of activities
1:57:47
permitted within them, and different prescriptions for the “Matrix.” [Zoning
1:57:51
category in NWFP] We ended up with eight or nine alternatives that had different
1:57:56
themes and characteristics, and for which we’d estimated the harvest levels.
1:58:01
The billion board feet was somewhat of a magic number.
1:58:05
We wanted to protect the species and have harvest level over a billion.
1:58:12
The protection level the biologists hung on, was this eighty percent likelihood
1:58:19
of habitat for viable populations for the next hundred years, except for fish,
1:58:26
where you couldn’t likely achieve because of intermixed ownerships [waterways]
1:58:30
. At any rate, so we tried to do this.
1:58:34
Some of the alternatives didn’t meet the viability thresholds, others did.
1:58:39
But we went back to D.C., a set of maybe six of us, and met in the Indian Treaty
1:58:47
Room in the old executive office building with a number of Clinton staffers.
1:59:01
The President wasn’t there, the Vice President wasn’t there, the
1:59:04
Secretary of Interior wasn’t there.
1:59:08
It was really their staffers there.
1:59:10
Was Ag there?
1:59:14
It would have been just the staffers, right?
1:59:15
Yeah, it would be the staffers who were there.
1:59:18
Because Babbitt [Bruce] and Espy [Mike] were the Interior and
1:59:21
Ag secretaries at that time?
1:59:22
Right.
1:59:22
Yeah.
1:59:23
That’s good.
1:59:24
So
1:59:28
anyway, let me go on.
1:59:35
We presented these to Secretary Babbitt’s staff, and they talked for hours.
1:59:42
We went through this in great detail, much more detail than I
1:59:46
think we should have, and especially on the biological side, for them.
1:59:49
And also,
1:59:53
they gave us no food at all.
1:59:55
I don’t know who was thinking about what
1:59:59
we needed there.
1:59:59
It’s because it’s dinner time now for us, too.
2:00:01
Yeah.
2:00:04
And Secretary Babbitt had an associate or his undersecretary, who
2:00:13
was very tight with the Carpenter’s Union, come into the room, I’ll
2:00:18
never forget, jiggling his change.
2:00:19
He was standing in the back, and all he asked is, “what’s the harvest
2:00:24
level?” That’s all he wanted to know.
2:00:27
He heard some numbers and he laughed.
2:00:30
Basically, they were dissatisfied with the harvest that would be
2:00:36
associated with the levels of species protection they thought were needed.
2:00:43
So, the tradeoff was too much for what they initially heard?
2:00:45
Yeah.
2:00:46
And at the same time, even before we’d gotten there, and there was a sense
2:00:56
that we had done this all independently.
2:00:59
Perhaps if we integrated it, we could find some efficiencies.
2:01:03
It really was a look for efficiencies.
2:01:05
And the efficiencies were really related to where the key watersheds
2:01:11
and the late successional reserves
2:01:14
were located, and if we
2:01:18
could overlap them more and things like that.
2:01:23
We reached an agreement with them that we’d go back and craft one more that
2:01:28
had characteristics they’d like, they did like some things more than others,
2:01:34
and yet, might achieve a harvest level of over a billion board-feet.
2:01:39
And that meant a one-month extension [sixty- day deadline becomes ninety] . We
2:01:46
did that, and we went back to work.
2:01:49
And that’s where something unusual happened.
2:01:56
Members of the different groups, key members,
2:02:03
Franklin, Sedell,
2:02:07
Forsman, and myself,
2:02:15
we went literally behind a curtain and started.
2:02:19
There was a curtain.
2:02:21
And back there, we got pens and we started redrawing the alternatives to
2:02:25
try to incorporate the different ideas we’d gotten from D.C. and elsewhere
2:02:31
while still achieving a board-feet harvest level that was a little
2:02:35
higher, really over a billion, and yet, still would have the protections.
2:02:42
And so, that went on.
2:02:43
And with drawing, changing the boundaries of the reserves,
2:02:50
that certainly
2:02:54
was very collaborative.
2:02:55
But the people that were involved in that one were all friends and had been involved
2:03:00
with this at least from the Gang of Four.
2:03:02
So, it was collegial?
2:03:04
Oh, yeah.
2:03:04
By definition.
2:03:06
Yeah.
2:03:06
I give Eric Forsman all the credit in the world because if he hadn’t been
2:03:12
willing to participate, we didn’t really have somebody from the owl side.
2:03:18
He really helped.
2:03:20
We crafted something and quickly estimated the numbers, and the
2:03:24
numbers turned out okay, 1.1 billion.
2:03:30
What happened
2:03:34
all the way through this, is when we’d calculate the numbers, we did
2:03:37
get responses from operations people, who would ask, is this feasible?
2:03:41
We’d work them through and make deductions if it wasn’t feasible.
2:03:44
Then
2:03:47
what happened, for a couple of evenings,
2:03:53
Franklin’s idea, before the forest supervisors came in to
2:03:57
look at them, we would talk about
2:04:04
the alternatives.
2:04:04
And this was in Portland?
2:04:07
Yeah, it was in Portland.
2:04:08
So, that was against the spirit of the original idea to keep
2:04:11
the managers out, correct?
2:04:13
Yeah, yes.
2:04:15
Well, it
2:04:18
[laughs], it wasn’t so much that we wanted to keep them out, as that we
2:04:25
had to break through this commitment to their existing proposed sale program.
2:04:29
But, we still desperately wanted to know what they thought of it
2:04:32
all, and where the flaws were.
2:04:34
What is your recollection of what they thought of it?
2:04:38
Well, they were stunned.
2:04:41
Good stunned, or bad?
2:04:42
No, they were just stunned.
2:04:44
Okay.
2:04:44
And not quite sure what the hell all this was, because it was so unprecedented.
2:04:50
Is this really going to happen, and when do we get our shot?
2:04:53
And so, they did come in, and Jerry walked them through it.
2:04:56
I thought it was very brave for Jerry, very courageous for him.
2:05:00
He did walk them through it.
2:05:02
And by that,
2:05:07
I mean Alternative 9.
2:05:08
And so, we didn’t go back to D.C., but Jack may have
2:05:13
gone, I’m not sure about that.
2:05:15
However,
2:05:19
the President did pick it as his alternative [NWFP]
2:05:25
. That last crucial stage was where we started trying to
2:05:29
meld things together, and
2:05:35
Jack was very magnanimous because it was as much identified with
2:05:40
Franklin as anyone, but it happened.
2:05:43
And yeah, done with felt-tipped pens.
2:05:49
That’s how the LSR’s came to be, the boundaries.
2:05:51
[Late Successional Reserves]
2:05:53
Now, what was your feeling at the time, about the zoning scheme, criticisms
2:06:05
and compliments, and versus now, how you see it [NWFP] actually
2:06:09
working out in real time and space?
2:06:11
Especially when the new guidelines and rules were added, and Jerry
2:06:14
told me a lot about that, “survey and manage” and stuff like that.
2:06:17
Well, first off, in terms of the fundamental design, I am happy to
2:06:22
say that what I am going to say to you now, is confirmed by a headline
2:06:26
in the Oregonian from 1994 or ’93.
2:06:36
Okay, now we have Option 9 [Actually “Alternative 9”] done,
2:06:40
and it’s over, just about over.
2:06:43
We haven’t done a harvest report, because we’ve been calculating the harvest levels.
2:06:49
Within that zoning plan?
2:06:51
The latest one, yeah.
2:06:54
We never got a harvest report into the FEMAT report.
2:06:58
That’s the one part that’s missing.
2:07:02
In that report, we pointed out
2:07:08
that in the “Matrix,” for the first 30 years, the harvest was still supposed
2:07:14
to come from the mature and old growth, and we didn’t see how that would
2:07:17
happen. We didn’t see how it happened in 1993, and we put it in our report.
2:07:23
The Oregonian, I don’t know who gave it to them, I just turned the report in
2:07:27
to the group then working on the NEPA document, and I didn’t give it to anybody.
2:07:33
Then, it got leaked to the Oregonian, and they published the headline
2:07:37
above the fold, “Clinton Plan Doubly-Flawed, New Report Says.” I’d
2:07:45
got ahold of that, and it was because they were still cutting old-growth,
2:07:52
as without you wouldn’t have a sustainable predictable harvest.
2:07:55
We said it then.
2:08:01
Because what happened, the zoning was done, and with the distributed
2:08:05
cutting of the past, there was a lot of old-growth and mature forest not
2:08:08
in the Matrix, not as much in the reserves [Late- Successional] . It
2:08:11
was still there; it was still going to be the basis of the harvest.
2:08:14
So, in that part, which is a key part of this, we thought even before
2:08:19
the addition of “survey and manage,”
2:08:27
which really crunched the attempt to harvest the mature and old.
2:08:33
Adding another ESA element to it, right?
2:08:35
Well, not ESA.
2:08:36
[Endangered Species Act]
2:08:38
Oh, okay.
2:08:39
No, that’s real important, because that’s the rub.
2:08:42
The rub is, that I want to finish this thought, and I’m
2:08:46
going to come back to it, okay?
2:08:48
Yeah.
2:08:48
Go, go, go, just keep going.
2:08:48
The thing is that it was real improbable those harvest levels are going to be met.
2:08:52
We put it in our report.
2:08:53
All the people doing the harvest calculations.
2:08:55
The Oregonian picked it up.
2:08:58
Yeah, so from the beginning, we thought the plan was in some trouble.
2:09:05
Because you didn’t think that it would meet, especially, the
2:09:08
economic projections that were—
2:09:11
The harvest levels, because it’s dependent on the mature and old forests.
2:09:14
But there were basically two rows of the projections?
2:09:17
Yes, the projections were accurate, if those stands had been cut.
2:09:23
We were skeptical that they would ever be harvested.
2:09:25
And that’s because of?
2:09:27
They were still cutting old-growth, which is a major public controversy.
2:09:31
Yeah, so you just figured that it didn’t matter that this great plan
2:09:34
had come out, just the mere fact that it was continuing even within the
2:09:38
context of this multi-faceted plan, that was still going to be met by—
2:09:44
Protest and
2:09:44
-- Protests and controversy, and it was correct.
2:09:44
Yeah.
2:09:49
But the Survey and Manage , which Jerry talked about and was added later.
2:09:54
What happened is the notion that these are the living things within the mature
2:10:02
and old forests, of which there may be 800 species, most of them invertebrates.
2:10:07
We don’t know much about them.
2:10:08
You take 400 and say, if we find them, we’ll buffer them or figure this out.
2:10:14
That was Survey and Manage.
2:10:16
We said, if you’re going to reserve eighty percent of remaining old growth, none of
2:10:19
these species are known to be threatened.
2:10:23
You could assume this new set of reserves will protect them until
2:10:29
proven otherwise, or you can assume
2:10:34
that we don’t know.
2:10:35
Whenever we find one [“endangered” or “threatened”
2:10:36
species] , we’ve got to protect it.
2:10:39
Franklin and Thomas and myself were in the former camp, but folks,
2:10:45
after we left, convinced the Clinton administration to add “Survey and Manage.”
2:10:57
By the people that wrote the guidelines for implementation?
2:10:58
However, the thing is that there were difficulties before
2:11:02
because of this dependence on old growth and mature forests.
2:11:06
We wrote that.
2:11:11
The fact that it came true didn’t surprise me.
2:11:19
I wrote that
2:11:23
and turned in the report.
2:11:25
I didn’t make a big deal about it, but the Oregonian did before the ink was even dry.
2:11:31
So
2:11:34
that was a pretty big deal.
2:11:37
No.
2:11:37
In retrospect, we
2:11:46
made the mistake of continuing the same kind of division people have
2:11:50
done forever, which is dividing the area into reserves and matrix areas,
2:11:54
and that doesn’t work well anymore.
2:11:58
In the Thomas, et al. Conservation Biology 2006 or ’07 report,
2:12:09
we pointed that out.
2:12:10
The real well-known article, right?
2:12:12
Yeah.
2:12:13
Basically, they did it looking at the ten-year review numbers.
2:12:18
Correct?
2:12:21
So, nowadays,
2:12:35
the biggest change in our, my thinking,
2:12:41
certainly you can’t divide up the world into reserves and timber production areas,
2:12:45
it doesn’t work anymore on federal lands.
2:12:47
It just doesn’t.
2:12:48
So, you think that the zoning, however great it sounded and looked, that
2:12:55
it just was intrinsically-flawed?
2:12:57
Yes.
2:12:59
Elaborate a little more on that.
2:13:01
Intrinsically flawed in that
2:13:06
the “reserves”
2:13:12
needed a lot of harvest in the plantations, and to contribute a
2:13:16
fair amount of harvest as of this day, but we never counted it.
2:13:20
And the “Matrix,” federal lands just doesn’t have timber
2:13:24
production areas anymore.
2:13:26
There’s so many considerations on every acre, you just don’t have those areas that
2:13:31
we imagine where you just can schedule an allowable cut and be sure of it.
2:13:35
Somebody is going to be out there saying, I don’t want this to happen.
2:13:38
Yeah, or the biologists will come and say, no, we’ve got this or that.
2:13:43
So, that approach is not fruitful on the national forests.
2:13:50
I don’t think it’s fruitful much on BLM, either.
2:13:52
So, that’s a change in my thinking, that really is,
2:14:02
and the fact that economic considerations were sufficient to justify harvests.
2:14:09
Unless you provide an ecological benefit, you’re not going to have
2:14:13
a stable timber harvest program.
2:14:16
So, those are changes.
2:14:19
Why do you think the AMA’s failed, the Adaptive Management Areas?
2:14:25
There were one or two [Applegate, Central Cascades] that had some
2:14:28
activity, but most of them just didn’t.
2:14:30
The whole idea of the “laboratory” for new innovative methods and practices
2:14:36
on these areas, didn’t seem to go anywhere from what I’ve been told,
2:14:41
except for a couple of successes.
2:14:42
Well, it’s because of problems on both sides of the equation.
2:14:46
I
2:14:48
mean, [George] Stankey was right in his article, that when you’ve got threatened
2:14:52
species, it’s difficult to take risks, so folks protecting the threatened or listed
2:14:57
species, were reluctant for innovation.
2:15:01
That’s really true.
2:15:02
On the other side, I was part of the problem.
2:15:07
I’m sitting there one night in FEMAT, in Jack’s office.
2:15:12
Somebody from the White House called and said, “What the hell are these
2:15:17
AMAs”? Nobody knows this story. You’re the first to hear it, okay?
2:15:25
So, he [the voice from White House] says, “What in the hell,” I think
2:15:27
it was Lyons [who called] . “What in the hell are these AMA’s?
2:15:30
We can’t take any further reduction in timber harvest.
2:15:33
What are you doing with these AMA’s?” They were largely Franklin’s creation.
2:15:38
[Tom Spies also pushed the concept hard.]
2:15:39
It was basically a way to have a laboratory for his new forestry concepts,
2:15:44
would that be fair enough to say?
2:15:47
That’s a pretty good insight.
2:15:52
Because when we were thinking about them, they would be trying out things, but
2:16:04
would have some latitude in how much
2:16:08
timber was appraised.
2:16:09
Basically, the people with the threatened species and protecting them, said, “Don’t
2:16:14
try this in the LSR’s.” In the Matrix, that’s the timber production land.
2:16:22
They said, “What are you doing with this, you’re just going to try out things?
2:16:27
The harvest level’s already too low, and now you’re going to sort of cut loose some
2:16:32
land to try out things?” So, I said to him, “Well, you could reign that in some.
2:16:40
You could say that it’s an innovative way to reach the harvest level.”
2:16:46
Glass is half-full, in other words.
2:16:47
Yeah.
2:16:49
And actually constrain it to meet the harvest level, but that
2:16:52
they can also try other things, which is the way it turned out.
2:16:56
And so that greatly constrained what they could do.
2:17:01
And then the fact that some was mature and old,
2:17:09
where
2:17:12
they were already existing, like in Applegate [southern
2:17:14
Oregon] , they did find innovative ways to achieve the harvest level.
2:17:18
Down south, right?
2:17:19
And in a couple other places they did some experiments, but
2:17:25
soon, they were treated just like the rest of the Matrix,
2:17:28
because that’s what they were.
2:17:29
They never got the release from both sides to do something.
2:17:36
I was also told that for the AMA’s, it depended a lot on the
2:17:39
local supervisors and the staff [initiative, ideas, funding, resources]
2:17:42
. Oh, totally.
2:17:42
And whether they had people that were energized.
2:17:45
Like for instance, since I’ve been involved with the Andrews Forest, and
2:17:49
Fred Swanson and all those people, they had a particularly active core.
2:17:54
Yeah, they already had the institutional framework.
2:17:58
Yeah, they were right there ready to do the
2:18:02
experimentation.
2:18:02
Exactly, so Applegate had
2:18:04
— That was an exception.
2:18:05
Applegate had the institutional framework already.
2:18:09
They had an institutional framework [and engaged constituencies] . There was some
2:18:13
good stuff done in Goosenest, because it was near to the Redding office.
2:18:17
Again, an institutional framework.
2:18:20
You didn’t have that in most AMAs.
2:18:21
You didn’t create it.
2:18:22
The agencies didn’t realize that the agencies and their supervisors
2:18:27
didn’t have the wherewithal or the background, to create
2:18:30
institutions as experiment stations.
2:18:34
They just saw it as Matrix.
2:18:36
So, they basically saw AMAs is an extension of the Matrix?
2:18:40
Oh, yeah.
2:18:41
They just thought potential timber land versus laboratory land or whatever?
2:18:45
Exactly, because they still had the timber target.
2:18:47
Which they weren’t meeting?
2:18:50
Which they were going to have trouble with, yes.
2:18:52
Yes.
2:18:56
What happened is that Applegate did a lot of this, H.J. Andrews [Central
2:19:01
Cascades AMA] just did a little.
2:19:03
They have pretty much stopped harvest on
2:19:10
much of the AMA.
2:19:11
They had difficulties, so they did a little.
2:19:14
But Applegate
2:19:17
found really innovative ways.
2:19:19
They also had a collaborative group and a lot of public support,
2:19:21
which the H.J. Andrews didn’t have.
2:19:25
The Andrews floundered on the relationship with the collaborative groups.
2:19:31
I loved the work, don’t get me wrong, but
2:19:44
it’s hard to find anyone that supports the AMA idea in the region.
2:19:50
Because they saw how it didn’t work, and they understood why?
2:19:54
I don’t know
2:19:59
the reasoning, but that’s one
2:20:05
that’s still innovative.
2:20:07
But the basic zoning,
2:20:19
those three zones, the LSR’s, the Matrix and
2:20:26
AMA’s, didn’t create the distinctions that were hoped for.
2:20:41
The Aquatic Conservation Strategy was a tremendously innovative
2:20:47
development under FEMAT.
2:20:49
It’s really something and it’s evolved.
2:20:52
It was a major contribution to thinking.
2:20:58
We had this riparian buffer in the zoning.
2:21:07
Basically, the
2:21:35
zoning, all parts of it, are imperfect, and
2:21:44
the national forests are being managed without the distinctions
2:21:51
between the different zones
2:21:57
that were envisioned, especially those three.
2:22:01
The only one that gets close is the Aquatic Conservation Strategy, and
2:22:07
even that, because of an inability to innovate, is very limited.
2:22:11
But do you think that the Aquatic Conservation Strategy would be categorized
2:22:14
as perhaps the plan’s biggest success?
2:22:23
I think
2:22:26
it was the biggest intellectual innovation.
2:22:32
I think the plan
2:22:37
was successful despite what I just said about the zones.
2:22:41
I think the plan was successful in fundamentally changing our thinking
2:22:49
about national forests and their function, and how we look at that.
2:22:57
And so, I think it was really an important document to shift
2:23:03
perceptions and foundations.
2:23:05
I’ve got a question directly on that.
2:23:07
I don’t read all my questions because you were going along
2:23:10
and answering a lot of them.
2:23:11
But this one, I want to ask specifically right now.
2:23:15
In natural resource planning history, how would you describe the Northwest Forest
2:23:20
Plan, maybe in terms of if you were teaching a class, let’s even say, in terms
2:23:24
of process and policy content, and can it be considered a model or a one-time thing?
2:23:33
Read that again, please.
2:23:33
Okay, in natural resource planning history, how would you describe the
2:23:38
Northwest Forest Plan in terms of process and policy content, and can it be
2:23:44
considered a model or a one-time thing?
2:23:54
In
2:23:58
the process used, sequestering a bunch of scientists in a tower and
2:24:03
giving them the keys to the kingdom, I think it’s a one-time thing.
2:24:07
I think it only occurs in time of crisis.
2:24:10
And that was a time of crisis.
2:24:11
When existing institutions cannot cope.
2:24:16
So, you have to have a crisis, you have the have the failure of
2:24:19
existing institutions to cope.
2:24:23
But in terms of the notion that you need to deeply engage the scientific
2:24:31
community supported by, but unfettered by
2:24:39
management, to create planning frameworks,
2:24:44
where the scientists take what they’ve learned and turn it into
2:24:47
a framework for planning, that enabled the protection of species
2:24:56
and ecosystems, it was a major model.
2:25:01
Even though I would do it differently, still, the notion that you need scientific
2:25:08
involvement to move beyond summarizing the results to suggest a planning
2:25:13
framework, how you implement ideas for understanding of aquatics, the ideas for
2:25:18
understanding spotted owls, that was a really important contribution, and really
2:25:28
needs to be part of the institutional framework for planning on federal lands.
2:25:32
Have you seen aspects or large components of this transferred elsewhere in
2:25:40
the United States in federal land planning and policy implementation?
2:25:47
There hasn’t been one event this celebrated, this high level, but I
2:25:51
know elements of it have been used in transfer to tribes [Indian] . Right?
2:25:56
Yeah.
2:25:59
Many of them are species-specific like the lynx, in which they need to engage
2:26:07
the scientific community in moving beyond
2:26:12
explaining how you turn it into management.
2:26:20
I think that, in SNEP, we’ve tried to do that.
2:26:26
That is, the Sierra Nevada [Ecosystem Project]
2:26:32
. And in that little book you’ve got, the gray book—
2:26:39
The bio-regional assessment book?
2:26:40
Yeah.
2:26:42
That book has examples, okay.
2:26:47
But I’ve got to tell you that now, at least in this region, people
2:26:53
are moving the other direction, in which the scientists are being
2:26:57
told, “don’t do that.” You see that in the science assessment that’s
2:27:01
going on now led by the PNW Station.
2:27:03
The twenty-year assessment?
2:27:04
No, the one about the science findings framework.
2:27:08
Oh, basically, they’re assessing science, per se, as a tool.
2:27:12
Right?
2:27:12
Yeah, and supposedly providing a framework for planning, but it’s not
2:27:17
being done, because the scientists aren’t taking that next step.
2:27:20
They’re really staying way back inside their discipline, summarizing
2:27:23
the results, near as I can tell.
2:27:26
I think that’s a real problem.
2:27:27
I’m worried.
2:27:28
We’ll see how it all turns out.
2:27:30
But the lesson of FEMAT is if you want scientifically-credible strategies,
2:27:36
scientists have to help create them.
2:27:39
You just can’t turn them over to management.
2:27:42
Now, who are the people that put in some of the rules that Jerry, for instance,
2:27:46
said, and I know Jack, didn’t like either?
2:27:49
But I just want to come back to this for a minute, okay?
2:27:51
Okay, no problem.
2:27:52
Thomas changed everything with ISC when he said, “scientifically credible”
2:27:58
strategy for the northern spotted owl. If you want scientists involved in this,
2:28:04
you want scientifically-credible strategies. The scientists have to move
2:28:08
out of just summarizing results to helping create them, or they won’t be credible.
2:28:13
That’s the lesson of ISC, Gang of Four, FEMAT, for all of them.
2:28:18
You have to put in detail and prescriptions, and not just
2:28:24
-- ? You have to say what sort of planning frameworks fit the underlying
2:28:30
science of the way these things work.
2:28:33
You have to find a way to do that.
2:28:36
It doesn’t necessarily mean the scientists have to do it all,
2:28:39
but they have to be engaged.
2:28:41
And we have not figured out how to do that in this region.
2:28:45
But so, you think though that some of the prescriptions that were problematic
2:28:49
after FEMAT and its implementation.
2:28:52
Right.
2:29:01
I’m saying
2:29:05
that FEMAT and
2:29:14
this whole process, showed that, given the issues faced by federal lands,
2:29:20
and given our modern society and understanding, and their expectations,
2:29:24
until the recent election perhaps, of our reliance on science, that
2:29:34
you can’t separate science from management.
2:29:39
You can’t just say, “Scientists, summarize the results. We’ll figure
2:29:43
out how to use it.” That doesn’t work. That’s the major lesson of all of this.
2:29:50
And so, it did provide a new, if you want to use it, a new
2:29:58
intellectual and institutional approach to planning and policy on the federal lands.
2:30:04
Perhaps closer to what Jerry calls “wild science”?
2:30:09
Institutionally-directed science was what before ruled the roost, and it was
2:30:15
tied to previous goals and paradigms and philosophical foundations, and the “wild
2:30:21
science” being science, basic science for science’s sake, had a role of coming
2:30:26
in, this is what we see independent of what the institution previously viewed
2:30:33
as science and its role within that institution’s mission and mandate?
2:30:38
I actually think I’m saying something different, but I know.
2:30:41
Okay, I’m just saying what might have said—
2:30:43
I’m not talking about whether it’s directed science or original
2:30:46
science, but I am saying that you need scientists to help translate
2:30:52
it into planning frameworks.
2:30:53
I’ll give you the number one example.
2:30:58
Before the ISC,
2:31:02
the Forest Service was focused on little “free owl clusters” around the
2:31:11
region as the owl protective framework.
2:31:14
Which is essentially what this 1985 report was about, correct?
2:31:17
Exactly.
2:31:21
The owl scientists, it took them a long time to finally come up with the idea,
2:31:30
based on owl biological data, that you need self-sustaining areas
2:31:35
of owl populations close enough together so they could disperse.
2:31:42
And then they actually illustrated one of them.
2:31:45
There could be others, or there are others.
2:31:49
That’s what I mean by turning science into a planning framework
2:31:52
with a matrix in-between.
2:31:54
That’s what I meant by that.
2:31:56
While it needs to be more ecumenical than in the past, I am gravely
2:32:02
concerned that scientists are now being told to stay in their caves,
2:32:11
just summarize the results and they’ll figure out how to turn it into
2:32:14
planning framework, and it won’t work.
2:32:15
Kind of like the old days?
2:32:16
Yes.
2:32:17
The aquatic conservation strategies are another example, okay?
2:32:24
And so, that is a major lesson of FEMAT, it really is, that
2:32:33
managers can’t do it on their own.
2:32:34
They can’t just take the science, whether it’s domesticated or wild, and
2:32:37
figure out how to weave their goals into a framework that incorporates this.
2:32:42
Especially now that all the laws from the post-environmental age are
2:32:48
intricately intermeshed into our
2:32:53
political and legal framework.
2:32:55
I mean, you can’t just unweave that just because you want to not do it any more.
2:33:00
Yeah.
2:33:00
That’s right.
2:33:01
I mean, it’s hard, but you can’t just completely take it away, correct?
2:33:06
That’s right.
2:33:06
No, it’s right.
2:33:08
Now, on to your question about what happened after FEMAT.
2:33:11
We were sent home.
2:33:14
The Clinton administration got very concerned that
2:33:21
they might not pass muster with the judge.
2:33:24
Dwyer?
2:33:25
With Judge Dwyer, because they couldn’t say they had protected all the
2:33:30
invertebrates and the red tree vole, because we didn’t know much about them.
2:33:36
Dwyer wanted to know about these other creatures, too?
2:33:38
Correct?
2:33:40
He knew nothing about this.
2:33:42
Oh, okay.
2:33:42
At this stage.
2:33:42
I wasn’t sure.
2:33:43
No.
2:33:44
It’s not like he asked about them.
2:33:45
No, it hadn’t gone back to Dwyer.
2:33:47
Okay.
2:33:48
They wanted to craft something where they could say they protected everything.
2:33:51
Now, none of these were
2:33:56
threatened and endangered.
2:33:57
None of
2:34:00
them.
2:34:00
He just didn’t know about them.
2:34:02
Again, you’re going to assume the plan will protect them until you learn
2:34:05
otherwise, or you’re going to assume it won’t and have to use special features.
2:34:08
They decided to go to this approach.
2:34:10
The people that did it, many of them scientists.
2:34:14
But they were scientists, and they got
2:34:19
people
2:34:28
that had expertise for these creatures and some others, and
2:34:34
basically created an
2:34:39
additional layer that changed it from an ecosystem plan to a species plan.
2:34:47
And that’s the fine-filter versus the coarse-filter thing?
2:34:48
Yeah, the coarse filter and the fine filter.
2:34:52
The fine filter was for all these species.
2:34:54
Now,
2:34:58
what did it really impact?
2:34:59
Because that also came through various political settlements.
2:35:03
What that really
2:35:08
impacted, thinnings exempt, was the remaining mature and old growth.
2:35:13
So, that really was the death knell of doing that kind of harvest.
2:35:18
Keep going along where you were.
2:35:19
Well,
2:35:22
there is no question, we were disappointed with the
2:35:28
addition of “survey and manage,” in part, because we didn’t think it was
2:35:33
consistent with the philosophy of the plan, which was really an ecosystem plan.
2:35:38
Basically, the coarse-filter, landscape-level.
2:35:41
Right.
2:35:41
Save enough stuff, but you’ve got to have some freedom to do other things, correct?
2:35:45
And these species were not known to be in trouble,
2:35:52
and they didn’t take enough of a reduction in harvest
2:36:04
in terms of protecting these species.
2:36:10
On the other hand,
2:36:17
our latest ecological forestry ideas talk about leaving the
2:36:22
mature and old growth alone.
2:36:24
Survey and
2:36:28
Manage, and the red tree vole, indirectly assisted in that.
2:36:32
Maybe it would have been stopped anyway.
2:36:35
But
2:36:39
the national forests, realizing they couldn’t implement the harvest schedule
2:36:48
with FEMAT,
2:36:51
they shifted mainly to thinning in
2:36:56
plantations.
2:36:56
The national forests have, depending on where you are,
2:37:01
another 20-30 years of that.
2:37:09
They don’t have
2:37:11
the notion of FEMAT that you would have sustainable timber harvest levels
2:37:17
forever, long-term, sustained-yield.
2:37:20
That idea is pretty much gone.
2:37:24
How do you think that the timber industry, especially regarding
2:37:27
retrofitting mills for different sized logs and forest products broadly
2:37:32
speaking, has adapted to this lessened yield regime, and for what it is?
2:37:38
Well, over here on this side of the mountain [the “wet” west side of
2:37:42
the Cascades] , what they’ve adapted to is private wood. By and large,
2:37:48
the federal timber is bonus wood, as you can’t depend on it.
2:37:52
So, they basically have to go to something else.
2:37:55
And they say, oh, wow, we got manna from heaven, but we never can expect that,
2:38:03
right?
2:38:03
They can get some, but there’s private wood
2:38:09
which is how most of the mills are set up, mini-mills like
2:38:11
Seneca’s mill north of Eugene.
2:38:14
Aaron Jones’
2:38:18
mill.
2:38:18
They can take either, as their mill is set up for private wood or
2:38:24
federal wood that’s the same size.
2:38:26
It’s almost all from
2:38:32
thinnings.
2:38:32
The federal wood is not making the unique contribution to industry
2:38:38
it used to with old growth.
2:38:40
Not anymore.
2:38:42
It’s just your common, ordinary, mill-run wood.
2:38:52
At that time, we had a crisis across the region felt by political leaders.
2:39:02
They realized the regional economy is going to keep growing, but this is
2:39:07
also about local community dynamics.
2:39:09
Now, it’s pretty isolated.
2:39:13
I mean, it’s includes Sweet Home and Oakridge, communities
2:39:15
that have never recovered.
2:39:17
But
2:39:19
we don’t have the sense of economic crisis related to federal
2:39:25
timber we used to over here.
2:39:30
Over in eastern Oregon, especially way over into John
2:39:33
Day country, it’s different.
2:39:35
But over here, there is just not the economic crisis based
2:39:39
in dependence on federal timber.
2:39:40
Well, because you have urban cores.
2:39:43
And other things that support the economy.
2:39:47
The places over there are different
2:39:49
? That’s right.
2:39:50
And look at Philomath, they used to have ten mills when I was a grad student.
2:39:54
Now it has one.
2:39:56
Philomath, of course, is now a bedroom community of Corvallis.
2:40:01
And so much was very traumatic.
2:40:04
There was an economic calamity for the communities.
2:40:07
Many of them have moved on, some of them haven’t.
2:40:11
But we just don’t have that sense of things hanging on the federal timber.
2:40:19
Now, do you think even in whatever scenario going forward, that
2:40:24
administrative executive action can overturn these things, and things
2:40:30
can start going back to the way they used to be, in limited doses anyway?
2:40:36
Let’s
2:41:11
see, are things going to roll back?
2:41:13
What’s going to happen?
2:41:14
I believe
2:41:17
I’m pretty confident of this.
2:41:22
Ironically, just like in 1992 when candidate Clinton came to Eugene,
2:41:33
and said at a rally down there that included people
2:41:40
that worked in the timber industry, likely mill workers, he said, “I’m going
2:41:44
to fix this.” Meaning, the spotted owl difficulties and the whole injunction.
2:41:50
“I’m going to fix this.” And here, Donald Trump comes to Eugene and says,
2:41:54
“I’m going to fix this.” So, he did say, I’m going to increase the timber jobs.
2:42:01
You’re talking about when he spoke at the fairgrounds in Eugene?
2:42:04
I don’t know where he spoke, but I know is what he said.
2:42:05
It was at the Lane County Fairgrounds.
2:42:07
My friends went to protest.
2:42:16
But I don’t think that’s where the Trump administration has their heart.
2:42:23
They are on other things, like opening up the federal lands for gas and oil.
2:42:28
But they will sign anything like that which comes from Congress.
2:42:49
Again, we’re going to try to define the uniqueness of the O&C lands, basically
2:42:54
pull them out in some sense, of the Northwest Forest Plan, although the
2:43:01
main way in which they’ll be different than the Northwest Forest Plan, is
2:43:08
that younger stands now being thinned will be available for clear-cutting.
2:43:14
Is that a fair trade-out, considering everything, and the fact that the counties
2:43:20
are so strapped for money because a lot of the traditional receipts they were getting
2:43:25
all those years, are just almost gone?
2:43:28
I’ve never been happy with the idea of a special mandate [O&C lands] , but in the
2:43:34
last five years as this has bubbled up again about the O&C lands, I’ve come to
2:43:40
realize they do have a different mandate.
2:43:42
In FEMAT, we just treated them all the same.
2:43:50
I don’t know if it’s fair or not.
2:43:54
I mean, the counties do have very low property taxes.
2:43:57
So, there’s something going on there.
2:44:02
I think we’re going to go through that.
2:44:05
But I’m
2:44:11
not sure
2:44:14
they can get through that without having some modicum of ecological forestry.
2:44:20
So, they just can’t go, oh, we’re just going to do it the way it used to be and
2:44:23
just blade it flat [clear-cuts] . Right?
2:44:25
I think that will be difficult, first, for our senators to absorb,
2:44:31
for our governor who has a say in it, and for just people in Oregon.
2:44:36
This includes the downstate counties where there was a survey done.
2:44:43
By a combination Democrat and Republican pollsters, two
2:44:48
or three years ago, they were asked what choices they wanted.
2:44:51
You can have industrial practices on the O&C lands, or you could have ecological
2:44:57
forestry practices that would be more protective of wildlife and fish, and
2:45:01
get a quarter of the county receipts.
2:45:02
Which would you like?
2:45:05
All Oregonians were asked, including the people in the downstate counties.
2:45:10
They gave the same answer.
2:45:12
Which was?
2:45:13
We want ecological forestry.
2:45:15
Because?
2:45:16
Because they don’t like industrial.
2:45:19
It’s not good to look at, it’s not good for hunting, not good for fishing.
2:45:24
It spoils waters for the fisherman?
2:45:26
And there was no distinction between Republicans and Democrats.
2:45:31
How interesting.
2:45:33
So, I’m not sure about the people in downstate counties if you get
2:45:38
past the county commissioners.
2:45:39
You’re talking about Josephine and Curry?
2:45:41
[Counties in southern Oregon]
2:45:42
Douglas, yeah.
2:45:43
[County north of Curry and Josephine, Roseburg-Cty.
2:45:43
seat]
2:45:43
Douglas, right.
2:45:43
What they want there, and I think there may be a need to at least “paper
2:45:48
it over” with ecological forestry, which means some retention and some
2:45:52
recognition of diverse early seral.
2:45:57
I’m just convinced we’re going to see legislation. Previously, the
2:46:02
environmental community said that will never happen, so we’re ignoring that.
2:46:07
And Andy Kerr [environmental activist] , when he supported
2:46:08
Wyden’s bill I was involved with Franklin on concerning O&C lands,
2:46:14
he warned
2:46:19
that, “You guys will be real sorry if Trump’s elected and you see what happens
2:46:22
to these lands.” Well, it’s happening.
2:46:24
I think the main thing that the Trump administration will
2:46:26
do is rescind the legislation.
2:46:28
I think the energy for it will come from the national forests, and for the
2:46:38
O&C lands, from our local people and folks in the House.
2:46:42
But they’re going to have to get by the Senate.
2:46:44
Filibuster
2:46:46
possibility?
2:46:47
Yeah.
2:46:49
I don’t know where Senator Wyden stands.
2:46:50
I haven’t talked to him, and he hasn’t talked to me lately.
2:46:53
But on the national forests,
2:46:58
it would not be so much as changing the Northwest Forest Plan, as
2:47:05
potentially cutting off public protest under certain conditions, such as
2:47:11
if a collaborative group approves.
2:47:14
And that will come from Cathy McMorris-Rogers from Washington
2:47:19
State, and our own congressman.
2:47:20
What do you mean cutting off public protest?
2:47:22
What do you mean by that?
2:47:23
If a collaborative group agrees to it, you can’t litigate it.
2:47:30
That’s a real “third rail” for the environmental groups. It’s cutting
2:47:34
off their access to the courts.
2:47:36
Yeah, that’s
2:47:40
what I was going to say.
2:47:41
On the O&C lands in the Walden legislation, they said, this is enough
2:47:44
for the spotted owl, no matter what.
2:47:47
Now, just let me say, they do reserve the older half of the forest.
2:47:51
So at least, we have permanent reserves for the old growth.
2:47:56
It’s not all bad.
2:47:56
Can you see a complete overturn of the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:48:03
You know, this was tried by the second Bush administration.
2:48:07
And the trouble with it is,
2:48:11
it’s a lengthy process.
2:48:13
You just can’t withdraw regulation on all this.
2:48:18
You’ve got to go through a planning process and have some justification.
2:48:22
As
2:48:25
long as the Endangered Species Act is in place, I don’t see an overturning of it.
2:48:32
Can you see them taking that away?
2:48:35
No.
2:48:36
Not without getting rid of the filibuster rule?
2:48:39
Oh, and there’s a lot of support for it.
2:48:42
This stuff on protecting species is not a partisan issue when
2:48:45
you get out in the hinterland.
2:48:47
Okay.
2:48:47
Now, in terms of Republicans and Democrats, it’s not that.
2:48:53
So, regarding the Northwest Forest Plan, if it’s overturned, that would
2:48:58
be the result of overturning some of our fundamental environmental laws.
2:49:02
If they’re still in place, no, it won’t be overturned.
2:49:04
It just won’t.
2:49:07
Thank you for asking me that, as I hadn’t thought about that lately.
2:49:09
I just I think it’s an obvious question considering the era we’re entering.
2:49:16
Yeah.
2:49:17
I mean, this is unchartered territory.
2:49:20
No, but what we don’t know is whether the regional office [Region] wants to
2:49:24
overturn the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:49:26
They seem to want to go back to individual forest plans
2:49:28
[done by each national forest]
2:49:29
. You’re talking about PNW?
2:49:31
No, I’m talking about Region 6.
2:49:32
Region 6, excuse me.
2:49:34
And so, we’ll see.
2:49:37
So, at
2:49:40
any rate, but I do think BLM is going to be given a special deal.
2:49:46
What that does is it puts increased pressure on the national
2:49:49
forests to protect species.
2:49:52
That was clear in the Dwyer Decision.
2:49:54
So, regarding the BLM, what do you mean by special deal?
2:49:57
They’re be under legislation which will mandate more timber harvest.
2:50:01
Okay.
2:50:01
So you do think that’s going to happen?
2:50:03
That is going to happen.
2:50:04
I really think it is.
2:50:05
Yeah, and that will be both on the west side and the east side?
2:50:08
Well, they’re not really on the east side except Klamath Falls, the BLM.
2:50:12
Okay.
2:50:12
No, they’re not over there.
2:50:13
Okay.
2:50:13
But I think it is going to happen and fairly quickly.
2:50:19
In fact, congressional staffers are already talking to me, and
2:50:22
we’re trying to figure it out.
2:50:25
How would you describe the follow-up process [to NWFP] in terms of
2:50:29
monitoring, assessment and reassessment?
2:50:32
You can take any subjects you want.
2:50:34
Please just generalize about the whole thing.
2:50:37
You mean, what happened?
2:50:38
In terms of how you feel the schematics and the plan [NWFP] and the monitoring
2:50:44
follow-up, and how it’s been assessed and reassessed as it’s been implemented
2:50:50
and unfolding, over 5-10-20 years?
2:50:57
Well, I think in terms of monitoring the
2:51:03
key ecological variables, whether it’s old growth, owl habitat, or aquatic
2:51:09
ecosystems, it’s done quite well.
2:51:12
I think
2:51:16
the analysis has never been fully forthcoming on what was expected out of
2:51:21
the harvest, and how much was gotten.
2:51:25
I think that, continually, it’s been shaved and fixed and minimized, the
2:51:29
fact that they’re not meeting it.
2:51:33
You think that they have tried to put a pretty face on the
2:51:39
disastrous aspects to the economy?
2:51:41
Well, no,
2:51:48
I wouldn’t say that.
2:51:50
But, I believe
2:51:54
that may be what happened is that this was a promise by the President [Clinton]
2:52:06
. Now, you can say, no, it isn’t.
2:52:07
It was this harvest level.
2:52:10
And it was not met.
2:52:12
It was not met.
2:52:13
And yet, then they changed it [harvest levels] , so now we can’t.
2:52:16
But there’s always been a notion, there is no regeneration harvest.
2:52:21
[Refers to “regeneration” of Douglas-fir, which once was thought
2:52:21
to mean clearcutting] So, this is not real regeneration harvest, and that’s
2:52:26
part and parcel in keeping this going.
2:52:28
I don’t think that’s been acknowledged.
2:52:33
And it needs to be to make sure this is viable in 10-15-20 years?
2:52:38
Yeah, to be honest and fair.
2:52:42
And so, it has turned into sort of a lopsided monitoring analysis.
2:52:48
Very good on the ecological side, not so good and forthcoming on
2:52:53
the economic and social side.
2:52:55
That’s been my impression in talking to people.
2:52:59
I sense minimizing and avoiding.
2:53:05
Would that be a fair assessment?
2:53:05
Yeah.
2:53:11
What does the barred owl teach us about the limitations of proactive
2:53:17
management regarding humans and nature?
2:53:21
In other words, playing God while Darwin and natural
2:53:26
selection is ultimately the boss?
2:53:31
But that’s not a Northwest Forest Plan question.
2:53:34
No, but it’s related.
2:53:36
Did you add that one?
2:53:39
How’d that one get on there?
2:53:41
It’s in here.
2:53:42
I just didn’t ask it earlier.
2:53:44
Well,
2:53:48
one of the things the barred owl teaches is that
2:53:54
you should always be humble about whether or not you finally got it
2:53:58
right, and how you framed the problem.
2:54:01
Because the
2:54:04
Northwest Forest Plan missed that.
2:54:14
That teaches us is that we’ve messed a lot with this landscape.
2:54:21
We should not expect the ability to sustain species of interest
2:54:27
with continued human intervention.
2:54:30
This
2:54:34
is not natural selection.
2:54:38
That’s not what’s going on here.
2:54:41
We have engineered a landscape that is and has been very receptive to barred owls.
2:54:48
So, while they may have been here eventually and at these
2:54:51
numbers, we’ve helped . We’re living in a human environment.
2:54:56
That’s what the Anthropocene and all this discussion is.
2:55:04
We are just fortunate in this case
2:55:09
that we are able to counter this problem.
2:55:15
I mean, the [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife [Service] is having overwhelming success
2:55:20
with their barred owl experiment.
2:55:24
So,
2:55:28
we ought to get used to it.
2:55:29
We’re living in a human-dominated world, that’s a species of interest,
2:55:36
and we’ve probably made it harder for it to survive, but we’ve got
2:55:44
to step in.
2:55:45
But in this case,
2:55:53
we can on a continuing basis, change the power relationship.
2:56:00
What is the most important reason for having created and implemented
2:56:03
the Northwest Forest Plan, in
2:56:07
your view?
2:56:12
It
2:56:15
enabled
2:56:19
a
2:56:24
very wide community to understand forests and their functioning
2:56:34
better than ever before.
2:56:36
It really has been an amazing educational device.
2:56:41
And isn’t it true that almost even maybe more than in North America, a
2:56:46
lot of other countries have watched what happened during this process?
2:56:49
Oh, yeah, yeah.
2:56:51
Any examples that you can cite?
2:56:52
No, because I don’t keep track.
2:56:54
But I think that’s right.
2:56:56
It’s very hard when you’re in the middle of it to understand significance.
2:56:59
But
2:57:02
it’s like when,
2:57:05
and this is in another vein, but somehow we were talking to Bruce
2:57:10
Babbitt once in Union Station in Washington, D.C. He said, “This was
2:57:18
the major environmental accomplishment of the Clinton Administration, the
2:57:21
Northwest Forest Plan.” It really was.
2:57:32
It’s so significant and has filtered out into people’s thinking, that it’s hard
2:57:40
to understand its uniqueness any more.
2:57:42
I think it is.
2:57:44
But it really was, with the planning framework and its consideration
2:57:49
of the forest and ecosystems, a milestone accomplishment.
2:57:53
Even though, if you measure it by the metrics of the immediate issues, saving
2:58:00
the northern spotted owl, keeping the timber harvest going, it didn’t
2:58:02
do so well on either one of them.
2:58:06
But in the broader view, it’s really a magnificent accomplishment.
2:58:11
I’d like to get a couple comments about certain people that you worked with,
2:58:20
just kind of like short statements on
2:58:24
the main players.
2:58:25
First, Jack Ward Thomas, could you make some comments about Jack.
2:58:29
I’d follow Jack Ward Thomas anywhere.
2:58:31
He was just a fabulous leader.
2:58:34
And
2:58:38
as I told him, he does his best work when mad and upset.
2:58:44
[Laughs] No, he’s a grand leader.
2:58:47
That’s why so many of us hung in there.
2:58:48
He is just a wonderful leader and I’m so sorry he got hit
2:58:56
by that terrible illness.
2:58:58
He’s the coolest guy and was always good to me.
2:59:00
But he would test you.
2:59:03
And then, if he thought you passed the test, he believed in your forever.
2:59:08
John Gordon?
2:59:11
John Gordon is
2:59:15
somebody I never want to be on the other side of an argument from.
2:59:20
Because I can’t win it.
2:59:21
John Gordon could convince the birds to come out of the trees.
2:59:27
And he has a wonderful sense of humor.
2:59:30
He also has the ability to step back and understand,
2:59:38
to pull together in a summary way, as he did here, a lot of disparate ideas, and
2:59:44
to really understand the larger meaning.
2:59:48
Jim Sedell?
2:59:50
Jim Sedell was a real close friend of mine, I feel.
2:59:56
Jim
3:00:00
was
3:00:04
a sweet guy, but he
3:00:09
did not seem to have real ideological armament that would prevent him
3:00:17
from considering your point-of-view.
3:00:19
He seemed always willing to hear and learn from anyone he encountered.
3:00:26
I thought that was a really good trait.
3:00:29
Plus, he has more energy than six of us, but you know Jim.
3:00:34
Gordon Reeves?
3:00:38
Reeves?
3:00:40
Another close friend of mine, I feel.
3:00:50
Reeves is someone who,
3:01:01
let me just think for a minute how to say this.
3:01:09
He is one of the most difficult people to discourage of anyone I’ve met.
3:01:17
When he believes something - he follows his science anywhere,
3:01:30
criticism does not weigh him down, and he just keeps going.
3:01:37
He has a unique background because he was once a commercial fisherman.
3:01:43
He told me that.
3:01:44
And so, he has a love of
3:01:50
these creatures, the fish,
3:01:54
and he really thinks deeply and then pursues the implications
3:02:00
and conclusions of his thoughts.
3:02:01
And nobody can deter him, including anybody in a bureaucracy.
3:02:08
He’s really impressive.
3:02:11
Lately, then and now,
3:02:15
he will never moderate what he says to make somebody happy
3:02:20
or to agree with somebody.
3:02:22
He will not.
3:02:26
Eric Forsman?
3:02:28
Eric Forsman.
3:02:29
First,
3:02:35
I just want to say something about Sedell and Reeves together.
3:02:37
Oh, okay.
3:02:38
Again, the invention of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy, is a
3:02:42
magnificent intellectual achievement.
3:02:44
It just rippled out everywhere.
3:02:47
It’s the gold standard.
3:02:50
So, you think that’s maybe the aspect of this that’s maybe being used
3:02:53
and modeled elsewhere, more than any other one, is from this plan?
3:02:56
I think so.
3:03:00
In terms of Eric Forsman,
3:03:05
Eric Forsman is
3:03:09
a field biologist more than a modeler.
3:03:15
He is by far the most credible person to talk about the
3:03:20
northern spotted owl or about the
3:03:24
red tree vole or any of the species he studies.
3:03:31
It’s not too much to say, we wouldn’t have had Alternative 9 without him.
3:03:39
There was some resistance from other folks that had worked on the owl in the
3:03:43
ISC Report, but he was willing to assist in developing Alternative 9 as to how it
3:03:50
fit with a northern spotted owl strategy.
3:03:53
He was the key player in helping Franklin.
3:03:58
I’ve always appreciated that, that he was so willing to assist us, even
3:04:06
though we ended up with a little different plan than what he intended.
3:04:09
If
3:04:15
they’re going to make a movie about somebody in this [NWFP]
3:04:17
adventure, it’ll be about him, with Harrison Ford as the lead.
3:04:21
He’ll play Eric, huh?
3:04:23
Yeah.
3:04:23
But Harrison’s too old now.
3:04:24
Well, he is, but Eric’s getting old, too.
3:04:28
Yeah, I know, but I mean, the Star Wars remakes, because they look so
3:04:31
old and were not nearly as good.
3:04:34
Anyway, Marty Raphael?
3:04:36
I don’t know Marty very well.
3:04:47
He seemed more reserved and within,
3:04:52
really deeply within, the ecological perspective.
3:04:56
And he wasn’t much involved in trying to link all this together.
3:05:01
He’s a great scientist, though.
3:05:04
Anyway, Jerry Franklin.
3:05:07
Well, Jerry and I are very close friends, as you
3:05:12
know.
3:05:13
One more thing
3:05:19
regarding
3:05:23
Jack,
3:05:27
mainly in terms of FEMAT.
3:05:29
Jack provided the overall leadership
3:05:35
to make it all work, and to deal with all the federal and
3:05:40
political stuff coming at the
3:05:46
group.
3:05:49
Franklin
3:05:53
provided the optimism and the inspiration for enabling us to get a plan that
3:06:03
was acceptable to the administration, at least the ecosystem plan.
3:06:08
So, he provided optimism and inspiration.
3:06:10
Never forget that.
3:06:11
I mean, we’re working day and night.
3:06:13
And I saw him coming along the street in the morning, he was just whistling.
3:06:16
He was so happy.
3:06:17
Nothing would weigh him down.
3:06:19
And he has this credibility with almost all scientists.
3:06:28
It’s kind of remarkable.
3:06:30
Well, he was the first executive director of the LTER network, and his credibility
3:06:35
is found across many spectrums.
3:06:37
Yeah, and so it was.
3:06:43
His merely saying things, then and now, causes people to accept them,
3:06:51
where they wouldn’t necessarily accept them from other people.
3:06:55
And so all of that,
3:07:01
you’ve hit with the people you have
3:07:08
named, you’ve got the really, the important core group of FEMAT.
3:07:16
They’re the ones there, you’ve got them.
3:07:19
I only wish that I’d been able to interview Jim
3:07:24
and Jack.
3:07:25
[Both men died shortly before the Northwest Forest Plan
3:07:26
Oral History Project began.]
3:07:26
Yeah.
3:07:27
And ironically, I believe they both died of the same illness?
3:07:30
Yeah, they did.
3:07:31
Pancreatic cancer, correct?
3:07:31
Yeah,
3:07:35
it’s too bad you didn’t have that possibility.
3:07:53
These are all strong personalities, and in the end, it all worked out.
3:07:58
And many of us have stayed pretty close through the years,
3:08:03
and are still working together.
3:08:04
That’s cool.
3:08:05
Any last comments about the plan or the experiences or
3:08:09
something you hadn’t brought up?
3:08:11
Only that I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.
3:08:13
And
3:08:17
with that note, we will sign off.
3:08:19
Thank you, my friend.
3:08:20
Okay.
3:08:20
Sure.
3:08:21
Great interview.
3:08:21
Thank you.
