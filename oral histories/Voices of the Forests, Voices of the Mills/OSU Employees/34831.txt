00:02
Hello, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State
00:05
University College of Forestry.
00:08
I am here in Portland, Oregon with Dr. John Gordon, Pinchot
00:14
Professor Emeritus, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
00:18
We are here in the Benson Towers, which is the condominium
00:22
complex building where he lives.
00:25
With your wife, too?
00:26
Oh, yes.
00:26
With your wife.
00:27
And we are downstairs in the conference room.
00:30
Yeah.
00:31
We are going to do an oral history interview today centered on the Northwest
00:35
Forest Plan, but also, we are going to cover other subjects, which include
00:40
John’s biography and various aspects of his career and professional development.
00:44
But, it’s going to be focusing on the Northwest Forest Plan.
00:46
So, John, I want to thank you for being here with me today, and being willing to
00:50
take your time and share your memories and experience of this important forestry and
00:56
environmental natural resource planning event, shall we say, in American history.
01:02
So, thank you, John.
01:03
Well, thank you for coming.
01:04
I am flattered to be interviewed.
01:10
And within the limits of my memory, I’ll tell you everything I can.
01:17
That’s why I brought all these props [books, maps, etc.] , John.
01:20
Yeah,
01:23
okay.
01:24
They help people because this was a long time ago for everybody, and
01:28
it was a complex, long, drawn-out process, and it involved many
01:31
different facets and dynamics.
01:33
So, now for the basic questions and biographical information.
01:33
Let’s go
01:39
over that.
01:40
Where were you born and raised, John?
01:42
Well, I was born in Napa, Idaho, but shortly after I was born, my
01:46
parents, who were both from Iowa [Oskaloosa] , moved back to Iowa.
01:52
They were in the flower and nursery business, and they bought a little
01:55
business in a town called Marion, Iowa, in north-central Iowa.
02:01
Well, as they say, we got our summers from the Gulf of Mexico and our
02:04
winters from Canada, so the weather wasn’t one of the pleasing aspects of
02:09
the place, but I grew up there in a little Disneyesque, 3,000-person town.
02:18
What was your childhood like in relation to the natural world, being in the Great
02:22
Plains and the rolling hills of Iowa?
02:26
Well, my father was an inveterate outdoorsman, hunting and fishing,
02:30
so I remember doing both of those as among my earliest memories.
02:35
And in the flower and nursery business, with the greenhouse and various nursery
02:42
stock in back of the place, I was around plants and growing things all my youth.
02:51
And
02:53
so, I think the main reason I went into forestry was the usual kind of
03:01
naïve notion that you’d get to live in the woods and hunt and fish, and
03:04
probably get a government cabin to boot.
03:07
You thought you’d be Jeremiah Johnson or something like that.
03:10
Something like that, and my father had a good friend in college, who went
03:17
for a while to a little Quaker college in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to do sports.
03:21
But his friend transferred to Iowa State and got a degree in
03:25
forestry; this is in the ‘20s.
03:28
He then went out to the Pacific Northwest.
03:30
The friend, his name was Schmeltzer, and got to writing my father
03:36
how terrific it was to be a forester in the Pacific Northwest.
03:36
And so, I absorbed all
03:43
that while I was growing up.
03:47
And the Forest Service at that time was one of the more respected,
03:50
even romanticized, government land management institutions.
03:56
And the Pinchot legacy carried a lot of weight, well, it still
04:00
does, but especially back then.
04:01
Yeah, and I was urged to read all the stuff I could get my hands on about
04:10
forests and the outdoors and Pinchot.
04:13
And so, I guess it’s no surprise that I then went to college at
04:19
Iowa State and studied forestry.
04:23
So, what forested areas in Iowa were there?
04:31
The experimental forests that were used by the college?
04:36
The college had a couple of small, a few hundred-acre patches of woods: One, near
04:42
Boone, not very far from the college on the Des Moines River, and one in eastern
04:47
Iowa near a town called Pumpkintown, I think, that was about 600 acres.
04:54
Those were the only forests the school had.
04:57
There are fairly extensive forested areas in northeastern Iowa and southeastern
05:06
Iowa, and a little bit on the southwestern corner along the Missouri River.
05:11
But it’s certainly not a forested state.
05:13
In fact, the story was that the professor who introduced forestry
05:17
there, a guy named Bessey,
05:23
thought that if you planted enough trees, it would make it rain.
05:28
And Iowa didn’t have quite enough rain to produce the most bountiful corn crop
05:34
because they get a late summer drought.
05:35
So, the idea was to plant lots of trees and make it rain and grow more
05:40
corn, so that was kind of a link.
05:42
Along with seeding the clouds, too.
05:44
Right?
05:45
Well, they didn’t.
05:47
That school started, I think, as part of the horticulture department, in 1904.
05:54
So, you know, the airplane was one year old.
05:58
Okay, well, I was thinking of the ‘20s and after, actually.
06:05
So anyhow, that’s how it was.
06:10
What experiences did you have as a youth that helped create
06:13
an interest in environmental issues, science and forestry?
06:16
I mean, you talked about your father and hunting and fishing, but any particular
06:20
events or trips, even outside of Iowa, maybe up to Minnesota or somewhere else?
06:25
Yeah, indeed, we used to go to Minnesota fishing every summer after the war.
06:32
My father was in the army in World War II.
06:36
And I got to love lakes, and indeed, as late as the time I was a freshman
06:42
in college, I was taking a general biology course, and when we got
06:46
to marine biology, I just lost it.
06:49
I thought, this is it, I’m going to be a marine biologist.
06:52
So, I went to see the professor and poured out my heart about
06:56
wanting to be a marine biologist.
06:58
And he said, “Son, do you know where you are?”
07:03
[Laughs]
07:03
Point well taken, right?
07:05
Yeah, not too many inter-tidal organisms in Iowa.
07:10
So, I stayed with forestry.
07:12
But definitely, the excursions to Minnesota, lots of tree planting, lots
07:18
of hikes, lots of hunting in the small patches of woods around my home town.
07:26
And indeed, one kind of odd one.
07:30
I spent the summer while I was in high school, spraying roadside ditches
07:37
for the county with the brush-killer 2, 4, 5-T [active ingredient in
07:43
herbicides, including Agent Orange] , and got to wondering whether all
07:47
that was a really red-hot idea.
07:50
In terms of to you personally, or to the watershed, or
07:54
-- ? Controlling
07:58
vegetation that rigorously.
07:59
I mean, were you thinking of the toxicity to the environment?
08:01
Actually, I wasn’t thinking as much about the toxicity to the environment.
08:09
There wasn’t much [active ingredient] in those sorts of herbicides.
08:13
Okay.
08:14
But about reduction in biological diversity, the idea that I remembered in
08:20
southern Iowa where my grandparents lived.
08:24
When I was at my mother’s parents as a little kid, you’d go out in roadside
08:30
ditches and it would be full of wonderful things, everything from things to eat
08:35
like asparagus gone wild, to lots of different plants, wild roses for example.
08:40
And with the roadside spraying, you killed obnoxious weeds, but you
08:45
killed a lot of other stuff, too.
08:47
That worried me.
08:49
So, you had an early lesson that made you ask questions about what is
08:55
a good idea and maybe what isn’t a good idea, regarding natural resource
08:59
management and controlling nature?
09:02
Yeah, and seeing the inception of really-intensive agriculture
09:09
which came along there.
09:13
It went from the diversified farm where people could make a living on
09:17
eighty acres up through the ‘40s.
09:21
By the end of the ‘50s, you had to have 1,000 [acres] , and it
09:24
was corn and beans [monoculture]
09:26
. Because it was a monoculture.
09:29
I kind of wondered if that was a good idea, and that maybe people
09:35
were kind of a pesky species.
09:37
I had sort of
09:41
early environmental leanings in that way.
09:44
I’ve of course, come off that long since, but it was a factor.
09:49
And the fact that with that intensive agriculture, came things like fall
09:54
plowing, so that when the wind blew, as it always did there all
09:58
the time, the air was full of soil, and the soil drifted in the ditches.
10:04
You started seeing the clay come through on the little knobs in the fields.
10:10
And it didn’t seem like it was a very good set of practices to me.
10:15
So, you were seeing at least in the dust area, that your little
10:19
example of the “Dust Bowl,” just fifteen to twenty years before.
10:22
Right?
10:23
Yeah, my father and his father were very eloquent about that.
10:30
I remember getting many lectures on the extermination of the passenger pigeon
10:34
and what an awful thing that was.
10:37
And just in general, the
10:41
idea that we ought to be treating the environment a little
10:44
more carefully than we were.
10:45
So I take it that they were positive in terms of New Deal programs that were the
10:52
first major soil conservation programs in that part of the world, and the Dust
10:56
Bowl was a direct antecedent of that.
11:00
So, they were actually positive regarding government programs,
11:04
per se, or at least those?
11:06
Yeah,
11:09
my father’s father, my grandfather Gordon, started out as a pioneer in the telephone
11:16
business, and then moved to California while my father was still in high school.
11:21
But they came back-and-forth to Iowa, and I would talk to him a lot.
11:28
And his opinion was that the Roosevelt and the New Deal saved
11:33
the country from revolution, that there would have been revolution.
11:37
He was convinced, and he was a Republican of that era.
11:41
Which was a different kind than we see today.
11:44
Oh, much different.
11:46
I heard Paul Tsongas say once that he had a disadvantaged childhood, and everybody
11:51
reacted funny, because they knew he was born with a traditional silver spoon.
11:55
And he said, “Yeah, my parents were Republicans.” My parents were Republicans,
12:01
but they were quite a different breed. My mother, as was my father’s
12:08
mother, pretty convinced pacifists.
12:13
They believed in government out of your life.
12:16
They wouldn’t have dreamed of, you know, the government making rules about sex.
12:24
They wouldn’t have dreamed of having,
12:32
well, my father owned guns all his life, and I have all my life.
12:39
But this business of everybody carrying a loaded weapon around and
12:46
submachine gun-type of things, they would have been aghast.
12:50
I mean, they wouldn’t have understood it,
12:55
for
12:59
sure.
12:59
Anyway, when you were up in Minnesota, did you ever see
13:05
examples of the cut-and-run logging that was really one of the great
13:09
precedents for, shall we say, the foundation of forestry and conservation,
13:14
when we had the railroad logging up there in the upper Midwest.
13:17
Did you ever see the evidence of that and did that ever make an impression on you?
13:22
You know, I can’t recall as a child or even as a teenager, ever seeing that.
13:28
I heard stories about the fires
13:33
and the overcutting.
13:35
But the main image I took away from Minnesota that I think made a lasting
13:39
impression in relation to forestry and forests, was seeing the old-growth red
13:44
pine up in the Itasca State Park at the headwaters of the Mississippi River,
13:52
these beautiful big-old, red pines.
13:55
I liked those, and I thought that was a good thing
14:03
to have.
14:03
But, later on,
14:11
way later on, I worked for the Forest Service in Wisconsin, and saw a lot of
14:16
what we would now call pretty abusive logging, and pretty ugly clear-cuts.
14:24
I am in favor of clear-cuts, if
14:26
they’re done right.
14:28
But there’s also a way to do them wrong, and I saw those.
14:32
Also, scale and
14:33
--? Yeah, and then, when I worked in the Pacific Northwest as a
14:36
college student, I worked mostly in Washington on forest surveys.
14:42
We did all the private land on the west side.
14:45
It’s what they now call FIA, Forest Inventory and Analysis.
14:50
In those days, it was called “Forest Survey.” So, we’d visit these
14:54
plots scattered all over the map.
14:56
And I saw a lot of old, and not so old clear-cuts that were pretty poorly
15:04
done, down to the edge of the stream.
15:06
And
15:09
that made an impression, too.
15:11
Let’s go to your college days at Iowa State.
15:13
You talked about how you had a brief flirtation with wanting to
15:17
be a marine biologist, but you went into, was it a forestry track,
15:21
and was that actually your degree?
15:23
Forest management.
15:24
Forest management.
15:24
They had two bachelor’s degrees in forestry, one in forest management,
15:28
and one in forest products.
15:29
Okay.
15:30
I did forest management.
15:32
Tell me about that experience, what you were taught in terms of planning and
15:39
management paradigms at the time, maybe a key professor or two, and maybe like
15:44
you said, the experiences you had in the Northwest, maybe doing an internship or
15:48
whatever, that you did out in Washington?
15:50
Summer job.
15:51
Yeah, okay.
15:53
Well, I think that I was really lucky.
15:55
For the most part, I had excellent professors there.
16:00
I think they’re competitive with any I’ve seen since, and I’ve seen
16:03
a lot since, of professors, that is.
16:07
One in particular, a guy named George Thompson, taught forest
16:12
measurements and conservation.
16:14
And even though I had gotten good grades up to then, I never
16:18
really understood anything about mathematics until I took that course.
16:22
So, that opened a whole world to me.
16:24
I guess I thought measuring trees was practical, useful, and good for something.
16:36
He was demanding, but he also had sort of a literary turn-of-mind.
16:42
So, he was a fascinating guy to listen to and he insisted that you write in a
16:52
somewhat literate fashion, which in an agriculture and engineering college,
16:58
was not always at the forefront.
17:01
I had another professor, a guy named Fred Hopkins from New England,
17:08
and he taught forest economics.
17:12
I almost went to graduate school in economics because of him.
17:16
But he taught me something, a very simple thing, that I have used again
17:22
and again, and that is, his definition of forest policy was a standing
17:28
answer to a recurring question.
17:33
How good that it was in answering questions over time, was how
17:39
you told how good a policy
17:45
it was.
17:46
Unfortunately, the guy who taught forest management, who
17:50
shall be nameless, was clueless.
17:54
So, I didn’t learn anything about forest management in college as
17:59
now the subject is construed.
18:03
We would put a working circle on a map and say, okay, how do you get
18:06
timber from here to there, and that was about the size of it, how do you
18:12
know how much you have and how much you took away, and basic arithmetic.
18:22
We had a summer camp the first year, mandatory.
18:26
It was eight weeks in New Mexico up in the mountains.
18:29
Where in the mountains?
18:32
Right near, well, Apache Creek was the town, which was miniscule.
18:39
It’s in the Gila Mountains, isn’t it?
18:41
Yeah.
18:42
Or the Mogollon Mountains?
18:44
It’s in the Mogollon Rim.
18:44
[Mogollon Mtns.
18:45
– NM/ Mogollon Rim in Az.]
18:46
That’s what I meant, yeah.
18:47
Country that goes over into
18:50
Arizona, west south-central New Mexico.
18:52
Yeah, I meant to say that they call them.
18:55
Reserve was the larger town [New Mexico in Mogollon Mtns.]
18:57
Right, yeah.
18:58
A few hundred people in those days.
18:59
You’re close to Escudilla Mountain, which is on the Arizona side.
19:02
That’s right.
19:03
The White Mountains [Arizona – between Mogollon Rim and Mogollon
19:04
Mtns./New Mexico] Yeah, I used to hang out there a lot.
19:05
It’s beautiful country.
19:07
Yeah.
19:07
And real high.
19:07
It’s also where Aldo Leopold worked, you know.
19:12
Yeah, over in Arizona.
19:13
Well, but in New Mexico, too.
19:15
Was he?
19:15
In the wildernesses in New Mexico just south of there.
19:19
Sure, that is right.
19:19
So,
19:21
that’s where his famous story about the wolf with the eye.
19:25
I can’t remember the quote exactly, but you know the story.
19:28
[Fierce green fire]
19:28
Yeah, I do.
19:29
I thought that took place in Arizona.
19:32
Well, it was right on the border, I think, it was right in that area.
19:35
But anyway, that made a big impression on me.
19:40
In a lot of ways, that was the first culturally diverse place I’d ever been.
19:46
Because of the Native Americans, and also the Hispanics?
19:49
Several kinds of Native Americans, the Hispanic culture was the dominant
19:53
one, and then there were what they called the Anglos, who were a few white
20:01
ranchers, non-Hispanic ranchers.
20:04
Right.
20:06
And then,
20:09
a company called Marine Fox had a saw mill at Apache Creek.
20:15
And they had imported about fifteen black people to run the
20:19
saw mill, and they lived there.
20:23
So, you had this mix of black, Hispanic, white, Navajo,
20:31
Apache, a couple branches of Apaches, all kind of mixed together.
20:38
And for a kid from Iowa, that must have been an eye-opener?
20:40
Yeah, the part of Iowa I grew up in was mostly Norwegian, as the
20:47
majority of people in my home town were of Norwegian descent.
20:52
And the joke was that a “mixed marriage” was when a Norwegian married a Swede.
20:56
So,
20:59
you probably really love Garrison Keillor’s
21:05
humor?
21:05
Yeah, it’s almost too accurate
21:09
to put down.
21:09
People laugh that I have a statue of the “Unknown Norwegian.” I’ll bet there
21:13
is one somewhere in that territory.
21:14
Powder milk biscuits.
21:15
[Joke product on Prairie Home Companion]
21:15
. Yeah, there
21:19
you go.
21:20
So anyway, that summer camp was a great experience.
21:25
And then working in the Pacific Northwest on the Forest Survey,
21:28
was where I really started to—
21:30
And that was in Washington State.
21:32
Right?
21:32
That was, as I recall, it was all in Washington state.
21:36
We might have spent a short amount of time around Portland, but otherwise, it was
21:47
in King and Pierce counties, the county that Bremerton is in, and
21:54
then, over on the Olympic Peninsula in Mason and Jefferson counties.
22:00
The big topography and the big trees, I am sure, made a great impression on you?
22:05
Oh yeah, and I decided then, the first summer I was out there, that I was
22:10
going to live out my days in Seattle.
22:13
I was taken with Seattle.
22:16
And the first transformation, we went out there in early June and had worked there
22:21
a couple weeks, and it rained constantly.
22:23
You couldn’t see anything.
22:24
And we were up in the hills, the foothills around Mt. Rainier, and
22:31
suddenly it cleared up and there was that huge mountain just right
22:35
there, right in front of you.
22:36
And that kind of did it.
22:37
I’ve been a Northwest fan ever since.
22:42
So, you have these summer experiences, you go through your program, you graduate
22:48
with a degree in forest management.
22:51
Right?
22:51
Yeah, right.
22:52
After you did that, what were your goals?
22:55
Well, I had gone through ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] , but at
22:57
that time, they didn’t want anybody.
23:01
They had just had the Berlin Crisis the year before I graduated, in ’61, so
23:07
they had vacuumed up the whole second lieutenants they thought they’d ever want.
23:12
So, I had the option of doing another year and a summer in the Marine Corps, and
23:20
getting a commission, and I had applied for a Fulbright Scholarship to Finland
23:27
because I had a cousin in Finland married to a Finn, who wrote me about it and said
23:31
it was just the place for a forester.
23:34
And I got it [Fulbright] . So, I went to Finland and I was there in the
23:41
forestry school at the University of Helsinki for a year-and-a-half.
23:47
That was fascinating.
23:49
I learned a lot about forestry there, and particularly, about forest policy.
23:58
What did you learn that was different there from what was going on here,
24:00
especially at that point in your career?
24:03
Well, I was fortunate to work in a government research laboratory near
24:06
Helsinki, so I got to work with new ways of measuring photosynthesis
24:13
and respiration with equipment that I didn’t even know existed before I
24:18
got there, and worked closely with some really good forest scientists.
24:23
So, that was good.
24:25
The big lesson I got there was that forestry could
24:28
actually be good for something.
24:29
I had always kind of looked at forestry as something you do, not why
24:33
do you do it, but something to do.
24:36
There, they had a catechism that their main thing was to maintain
24:42
national independence, that it had lost some to Russia, who whacked
24:48
off parts of their country, but didn’t occupy the whole country.
24:53
But they had to pay heavy war reparations.
24:56
So, to pay that, they had to export to get hard currency.
25:01
What did they export?
25:02
Forest products, seventy percent of their exports.
25:04
Was it mostly softwood conifers?
25:07
It was almost all softwood, up to a point.
25:13
They connected efficient forestry directly to their national existence.
25:20
I thought that was impressive.
25:23
Another kind of
25:27
lesson that I learned, was that they, to keep productivity of conifers up,
25:33
they were getting rid of birch, which was mostly just a firewood up to that
25:37
time, even the nice birch, which has wood about like the yellow birch,
25:42
very nice, but they were poisoning it.
25:46
Just about that time, everybody in Europe decided they wanted
25:52
lightwood kitchen cabinets made out of, guess what?
25:55
Birch veneer.
25:56
So, the idea that you get rid of everything that isn’t immediately
26:01
useful, turned out to be a bad idea.
26:06
So, they stopped that practice before it had been completed, right?
26:09
Yes, they did.
26:10
So, you were somewhere in the middle, like what would you say
26:12
the percentage of elimination was?
26:14
[Birch trees]
26:14
I don’t know.
26:15
I don’t have any idea.
26:16
What did that teach you about biodiversity and the limitations, not
26:22
just economically, but ecologically, of a straight utilitarian,
26:27
economic, monoculture mentality?
26:30
That must have made a big impression on you?
26:32
Yeah, it did.
26:33
And there, I still bridle
26:40
in comparisons between, say, a conifer plantation here or in Finland,
26:44
and a corn field, as monoculture.
26:48
Oh, yeah.
26:50
There’s lots of species in there, even if you cultivated just a few.
26:57
Well, when people use monoculture to describe forestry, they’re just
27:00
mainly talking about whatever the dominant tree is, not because there
27:03
are lots of other plants in there.
27:05
And they function over long times, even in a forty-year rotation, that’s forty
27:11
years longer than a corn rotation.
27:13
So there is no equivalence.
27:15
However, the idea that you want to look at a whole system in how it
27:21
works, there were other benefits of the birch in suppressing certain
27:28
soil-born diseases, and the old spruce
27:34
functioning as a nurse crop for young spruce, and the trouble everywhere
27:38
with spruce, was spring frost.
27:39
If you had an over-story of hardwood, it helps with that.
27:44
They eventually discovered the white-backed woodpecker,
27:47
which only nests in rotten, old
27:52
birches.
27:52
Their “spotted owl,” so to speak.
27:54
Their spotted owl, yeah.
27:54
I went over there to talk about the Northwest Forest Plan at
27:57
the invitation of the Finnish Academy of Sciences, years ago.
28:01
And that had just come on the scene.
28:04
So, this idea, that
28:13
well, I don’t know how to put it, where I finally came down and where I still
28:17
am, is that forest variety is important.
28:22
It’s just as important as biological variety.
28:26
And you ought to have a lot of different kinds of ways of going about it.
28:30
But many of them should include a full deck.
28:34
I
28:37
also did the work for a master’s degree, which I never got, because
28:40
I would have had to buy another plane ticket and go back and march
28:44
in a parade, given their European idiosyncrasies, so I didn’t do it.
28:49
One of my professors in Finland, a guy named Pete Semicola, is a
28:53
forest microbiologist, and that was a whole new world to me.
29:00
I got interested in nitrogen fixation, which some years later I picked up
29:05
as kind of a main research theme, and
29:11
started looking at the components of natural forests and planted forests that
29:17
included biological nitrogen fixation.
29:19
In other words, the biogeochemistry, the cycling of nutrients, and
29:23
how they were related together?
29:23
Right.
29:26
And the taking of nitrogen from the air and putting it into the soil in a
29:29
form available to plants, intrigued me.
29:33
When I came to the Pacific Northwest and saw the war on red alder, I
29:43
tried to talk people out of it.
29:45
Because you saw that there were these other, less obvious, biological and
29:51
ecological, purposing for these things?
29:53
Yeah, there was kind of a natural rotation, actually on the west side,
29:56
between red alder and Douglas-fir
30:02
and other conifers.
30:02
The red alders usually come in first, correct?
30:04
Yeah.
30:04
Especially if they’re on a riparian path?
30:08
Or if they get an expanse of mineral soil and a good seed catch.
30:15
So, yeah, that
30:22
was kind of a major direction for me.
30:24
So, you came back from Finland, you didn’t get your masters.
30:26
What did you do next?
30:30
Well, the first thing I did; it was
30:36
1963, January of 1963, and I went to see my draft board because I had
30:42
to have a deferment to go out of the country to take the Fulbright.
30:46
And I wanted to go, I’d been admitted to Iowa State and to UC-Berkeley for
30:52
a doctorate, and I wanted to go to one of them, but I didn’t want to get
30:57
drafted the day after I went there.
30:59
Because this was right before ‘Nam?
31:01
Yeah, but there was nothing like that on the horizon.
31:04
Right, right.
31:07
You know, no citizen-level concern about a war.
31:11
The Berlin Crisis had died down.
31:15
We had a few advisors over there [Vietnam] , but yeah.
31:17
Yeah, I don’t know how many, and I guess I knew that.
31:20
It wasn’t on the radar of most people, the media or anybody.
31:24
So, I went to see the draft board and said, “If you’re going to take me, take
31:26
me now.” And they basically said, “Well, how old are you?” I think they knew,
31:32
and I said, “I’m 23.” They said, “Well, we send you old guys to the Army and
31:37
you just cause trouble.” And so, they were clearly looking for a reason not
31:46
to.
31:46
I don’t know if it was unusual or not, to tell you the truth, but
31:50
in rural Iowa, a lot of the young men were eager to get drafted.
32:01
One guy wrote home and said, “They let you stay in bed till five in the morning.
32:04
You can’t believe
32:08
it!”
32:08
It’s all about context, isn’t it?
32:11
The rooster crows before reveille, right?
32:15
So, anyhow, I didn’t go.
32:18
I went back to Iowa State, but I also had a chance theoretically to
32:26
go to Harvard, and they actually told me I’d get a $1,700 scholarship.
32:33
I thought, “Gee, that’s great,” until I looked up the tuition and realized I’d
32:38
have to get another $1,700 from somewhere, just to go to school, so I didn’t do that.
32:43
So, I went back to Iowa State and I got a doctorate in plant physiology and
32:51
silviculture; a minor in biochemistry.
32:56
So, how would you describe this whole process from your undergraduate where
33:01
you got a forest management degree, which you obviously weren’t all that
33:05
excited about aspects of it, you went over to Finland which was a great
33:09
experience, but you didn’t get your masters, and then you got your doctorate.
33:12
How did these things all fit together to turn out the person you were
33:16
entering the professional life?
33:18
Well, I think it really started when I was an undergraduate.
33:21
I was both a teaching and a research assistant.
33:24
I liked both of them, but I really liked the research.
33:29
So, I think from that time forward, I was sort on a track to become a
33:33
forestry researcher rather than a manager, and that’s how it wound up.
33:39
After I got my doctorate, I went to work for the Forest Service in
33:43
Rhinelander, Wisconsin, and I spent about five years there in a project
33:49
called “Pioneering Project in Physiology of Wood Formation.” That
33:57
was very rewarding.
34:00
I learned a lot.
34:01
My boss was a guy named Phil Larson, who was one of the scientists.
34:05
In those days, the Forest Service would pick a scientist and let them be as good
34:10
as they could at their scientific job, and they didn’t have to take on more personnel
34:16
responsibilities to get promoted.
34:19
And there were four or five of them, all pioneering scientists,
34:23
and he was one of them.
34:24
Did you work out of Madison, their famous laboratory there?
34:27
No, I worked in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.
34:29
You weren’t connected with Madison at all?
34:32
That’s what I meant to say.
34:32
No, no, not at all, actually.
34:34
We were part of,
34:39
when I started out, the Lakes States Region and the Lakes
34:43
States Forest Experiment Station.
34:45
Then it became the Amalgamated Two Region, and later it became the North
34:48
Central Forest Experiment Station.
34:52
But I also worked a lot with people from Madison from the Forest
34:57
Products Lab, and with people from the University of Wisconsin.
35:02
So, you were actually at an experiment station, then?
35:07
Yes.
35:08
How would you describe your time there, and how long did that last?
35:11
It lasted just under five years, from
35:21
’66 to ’70.
35:22
And it was a great time in that you didn’t have to do anything
35:26
but research, and didn’t teach.
35:32
So, it was an intense learning time, and I was able to put out some
35:37
publications and get some notice.
35:42
Probably would have stayed in the Forest Service the rest of my life,
35:45
probably in the research branch, except
35:51
suddenly, they came and said, “You’ve won the lottery, we’re going to make
35:55
you a project leader.” I was very young for a project leader. It promoted me
36:01
to a GS-13, and then they said, “You can have your own big project.” The
36:07
project was in Stoneville, Mississippi.
36:11
I had a four-year-old son, there were no functioning public schools there we could
36:18
find out about, so I started looking for another job, and wound up going back to
36:26
Iowa State on the faculty of forestry.
36:30
And what did you teach when you were there?
36:33
Just about everything.
36:37
Let’s see, my main job was to teach silvics and silviculture, but I also
36:44
taught forest influences, which is what they called watershed management in those
36:48
days, in Satterlund’s [Donald] book.
36:51
And I taught graduate courses in those things.
36:58
Let’s see, what else did I teach?
37:00
I taught wood chemistry for quite a while,
37:07
and freshman forestry.
37:12
I taught for a little while, forest protection, which is what they called
37:16
fire studies in those days, with a little bit on disease and insects and all that.
37:22
Now, you’re at Iowa State in the ‘70s.
37:26
Basically, all the laws that would change everything, were either
37:32
already passed, were being passed and implemented, and the landscape,
37:38
culturally, politically, legally, was changing in paradigmatic, major fashion.
37:45
Were you aware of that, or was it kind of like, you were in academia,
37:49
and this was happening out here?
37:50
No, no, on the teaching side of things, it was a revolution.
37:55
Okay.
37:56
And it really changed things a lot.
38:00
And how would you describe your evolution from, let’s say, the traditional
38:07
silviculture forestry that you were taught when you were in college?
38:11
You obviously learned some new things in Finland.
38:14
But how did that change you, from what you originally had to do,
38:18
and what you became as you evolved during that period in the ‘70s?
38:22
Well, a lot of the discussion in forestry circles was around those
38:27
issues, the Endangered Species Act, NEPA, all the legislation of the time.
38:35
Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, etc., etc., Wilderness Act, yeah.
38:39
And the Clean Water Act changed the structure of the forest products industry.
38:47
In Wisconsin, I think, it had 300 paper mills before the Clean Water
38:53
Act, and about thirty afterwards.
38:57
Those are very rough figures, but it was a transformational thing.
39:04
So, the whole idea of forestry being about more than moving wood, growing
39:13
it, moving it, which is fine, but
39:18
that era and the debate about those rules, when I was an undergraduate,
39:23
and the Wilderness Act was a big thing.
39:26
Why should we have wilderness, what does it cost?
39:30
The battle went on from ’56 to ’64 [Over Wilderness Act, in U.S.
39:32
Congress] . It took them eight years to get it debated, passed and signed.
39:35
Yeah, and that absolutely bracketed when I was an undergrad.
39:37
That’s why I brought it up, because it was a long process.
39:40
And lots of talk about it, so I would say that during that whole
39:45
era, I was changing with the times to take a more comprehensive view
39:53
of forests and forestry, and learned more and more about their components.
39:57
That was the same time I got this deep interest in nitrogen fixation and other
40:06
microbiological processes that go on
40:09
in the forests, and was particularly interested in how nitrogen
40:11
fixes in trees and its role in ecosystems, nitrogen fixing in
40:17
shrubs and all this, so that when I got to the Pacific Northwest, it was
40:23
kind of like having this whole new laboratory just shoved under your nose.
40:28
You
40:30
went to Oregon State after Iowa State.
40:32
Correct?
40:33
Yeah.
40:33
So you were at Iowa State for how many years?
40:36
About seven.
40:37
So, that was till ’78?
40:39
’77.
40:40
Seven, okay, and then you came out to Oregon State?
40:42
To Oregon State early in ’77, late ’76, I don’t actually remember.
40:48
Anyway, I was there until ’83, when I went to Yale.
40:52
So, did your own evolution just kind of continue out in Oregon, the same thing
40:59
that had been going on at Iowa State, or did it accelerate because you were in a
41:02
new environment, especially culturally, out here in the Pacific Northwest?
41:07
Well, I think it accelerated, because by that time, the old growth was an issue.
41:15
We had a Society of American Foresters task force on old
41:20
growth about that time, ’83-’84.
41:25
And the argument was, is there a better place for you to be or
41:32
--? Just a second here.
41:33
[Audio skips.] Alright, so continuing, you were at Oregon State, and we
41:36
were talking about how things kind of accelerated when you got out here,
41:40
and you were talking about the old growth, a conference on old growth.
41:45
Yeah, we did
41:48
censuses on old growth for the Society of American Foresters.
41:54
The usual suspects were already there, Jack Ward Thomas, Jerry Franklin.
41:59
Norm
42:03
Johnson?
42:03
I don’t think Norm was, I can’t remember.
42:07
But he’s in about everything, so I would guess, yes.
42:12
And
42:16
then, there was also at that time, the controversy about the use of herbicides.
42:24
Being there at the [OSU] college of forestry, Carl Stoltenburg, when he
42:30
hired me actually said, “Well, I want you to talk about this to people,” knowing
42:35
I had some chemistry background. So,
42:40
I did. I’d go around and talk to different groups.
42:43
And I guess in the first year, I kind of cynically figured out that
42:48
everybody in rural Oregon was either a dope-crazed hippie or a chainsaw-wielding
42:54
redneck, which is kind of a
42:58
harsh, inaccurate way to look at things.
43:01
A simplistic dualism, but I understand the point.
43:03
[Laughs]
43:03
But
43:09
it was really an eye-opener.
43:16
So,
43:19
gosh, it was, it was a full life, and there were always controversies,
43:27
always things to get, to
43:32
make you think.
43:36
the school of forestry [OSU] had a full spectrum of views about forests, including
43:43
not cutting them, and cutting them.
43:47
So, you had basically your own culture war going on in the department?
43:50
Yeah, pretty much.
43:52
And it was, to some degree, healthy.
43:54
I mean, if people talked about things that was good.
44:01
At the same time, what we now take for granted as kind of a simple-minded
44:07
kind of forestry, the industrial forestry model, sometimes called
44:11
short rotations, intensive-culture, it was just being invented.
44:15
And a lot of it was invented right there, from getting nursery stock
44:19
that would actually grow when you planted it, to controlling the
44:23
vegetation, to the silvicultural treatment of dense young stands.
44:31
Now, we take all that for granted.
44:32
We didn’t really know how to do it then, it just was coming along.
44:38
How innovative did you consider Oregon State University to be, not just
44:43
then, but in the context of your whole career, having taught at some of the
44:48
leading institutions in forestry?
44:51
Well, a guy I respected greatly, who was the director for a while at
44:57
the Pacific Northwest Station of the Forest Service, Bob Tarrant, liked to
45:01
say that Corvallis had the greatest concentration of forestry research
45:05
and forestry researchers in the world.
45:10
He said nobody ever contradicted him.
45:12
But I suspect he was right.
45:16
And one of the things that I think the college of forestry, particularly,
45:21
doesn’t get enough credit for, is that they really, to a large first
45:26
approximation, not exclusively, but largely inoculated that campus with
45:31
ecology and the ideas of sustainability.
45:37
Meaning, in other words, something that, shall we say, cross-pollinated
45:41
across colleges and departments into the other earth and science
45:47
departments there across OSU?
45:48
I think so, yeah.
45:53
It was a really exciting time to be there.
45:56
And despite the fact there were some fairly sharp personal disagreements
46:04
from my perspective, at least, I seemed to be able to get along with everybody.
46:08
So,
46:11
it was a fun time.
46:16
What do you remember about the “Forest Wars,” which were actually called that
46:23
a little later in the ‘80s? And do you remember the beginning of how that was
46:29
going, and where clearcutting started having environmental groups, and I don’t
46:34
know if the litigation had quite started yet, but they were definitely protesting?
46:39
And you had the “Old Guard” [traditional forestry] digging its heels in the
46:41
Forest Service and in industry.
46:44
Oh, yeah.
46:44
Yeah.
46:44
What do you remember about that?
46:46
A
46:48
lot.
46:49
I mean, it’s hard to know where to start.
46:51
Any anecdotes or stories, particular stories or anecdotes?
46:55
Well, I’ll tell you an anecdote.
46:58
It has names in it, so I don’t know what happens, as a result, but it’s true.
47:05
One of the letters I had on my desk when I got to Oregon State from Iowa was
47:11
from Bill Hagenstein, who is a legend in Northwest forestry, with the Western
47:17
Forestry and Conservation Association for years, just a big presence, even then.
47:23
He just died recently.
47:26
He’s always been highly-regarded.
47:28
So, I had a letter from him demanding that I fire Jerry Franklin and Dean
47:33
DeBell because they had written an article saying that sometimes
47:38
Douglas-fir grew in the shade.
47:41
And that was, it’s pretty close to accurate, I don’t
47:46
remember the exact words.
47:49
I was able to write back and say, “Well, I might think about doing that, except
47:54
neither one of them works for me. Jerry Franklin works for the Forest Service and
47:57
Dean DeBell works for Crown Zellerbach.
48:00
And in fact, maybe you could tell me why I have Douglas-fir growing under
48:07
oak in my back yard.” And I lived out in the west hills there [in Corvallis]
48:12
. So, it’s kind of like?
48:13
Sounds smart-alecky, yeah.
48:16
But I got along with him after that.
48:18
And
48:21
I think he just wanted to see, test a tenderfoot a little bit, and see.
48:27
Well, Jerry Franklin, he was an independent guy and he made his
48:32
“bones,” and as he developed what became “New Forestry,” he ruffled a
48:39
lot of intellectual, institutional and personal feathers along the way.
48:43
Would that be correct to assume that?
48:44
Oh, sure, yeah.
48:48
That’s true.
48:51
That was
48:54
one of the big controversies; could you grow Douglas-fir without clearcutting it?
49:00
I think the answer is yes, but not very well.
49:03
So,
49:06
you give up something, if you don’t give it light.
49:09
How would you characterize the dynamic of industrial forestry clearcutting
49:15
on federal lands, also private lands in the interfaces, BLM lands and
49:19
all that, so not just on federal lands, at that particular time?
49:25
What do you remember?
49:27
Was it sustainable in your eyes at that time, what you saw that was going on?
49:34
Well, not all of it, certainly, not all of it.
49:36
I remember that we had particular regeneration problems in
49:41
southern Oregon at that time.
49:43
Because of the dryness, right?
49:45
It’s dry and it’s hot, and there are all kinds of problems.
49:48
You get a lot of ravel, just gravity moving stuff down the slope, and
49:53
it covers up the little trees
49:57
and the
49:59
elk eating them.
49:59
And there are a lot of problems, but they were exacerbated by some of the practices.
50:05
One was using high-ground pressure equipment, mostly tractor vehicles,
50:11
big caterpillars on steeper land.
50:16
[Practice causes soil compaction]
50:16
And over-aggressive yarding?
50:18
Packing of soils, and
50:22
I remember in particular, looking over some land that had been owned by the
50:25
Robert Dollar Lumber Company, where it had been CAT-logged and really messed up.
50:32
Now,
50:35
it’s hard to keep trees from going in a climate like western
50:39
Oregon, so we’ll get some but—
50:42
But it will just be a much slower regeneration process?
50:45
Yeah, and
50:48
this outfit hadn’t even bothered to plant any trees, but this was in the
50:52
first days of the Oregon Forest Practices Act [Enacted in 1971, and required
50:55
reforestation] , which was a great thing.
50:57
Now, it’s kind of popular to grouse about it, and surely, like
51:03
everything else, it can be improved.
51:04
Are you talking about the aspect of it that mandated you replant within
51:09
whatever the period of time was?
51:10
And that you leave some shade on the streams, which a lot of
51:14
people didn’t in those days.
51:20
Which changes the fisheries and the water quality.
51:22
[Also temperature]
51:23
So, it was a time that the industrial forestry model, I think
51:29
I mentioned, was just being really invented in a way that could work.
51:35
And
51:39
one of the controversial things I guess I mentioned, and still
51:44
is, the use of herbicides and other pesticides on insects.
51:54
If you look at a comparison, we started a cooperative to study
52:02
different means of competition control.
52:06
[Control of competing vegetation] And from every aspect, except that which
52:11
says any artificial chemicals in the environment are bad, herbicides looked
52:16
real good as a way of competition control, compared with mechanical control where
52:21
you put people in there with chainsaws
52:24
or hand-slashers.
52:28
Wasn’t one of the people in Corvallis who was doing work on that, Logan Norris?
52:31
Logan Norris, Jack Walstad,
52:37
yeah.
52:38
There were quite a few.
52:44
When you came out of Corvallis in 1983, and went back to Yale,
52:50
what would you say you learned in that period of time that you then took back
52:55
East in terms of your own development, intellectually and in terms of how you
53:03
saw the whole gamut of forest planning, forest management, etc.?
53:10
Well, I guess, I took two main things.
53:15
One is, I had continued my research direction in nitrogen
53:19
fixation, and I took that to Yale and did some work on it there.
53:26
The other one was just in how you manage academic people and units.
53:33
And I think I learned a lot about that at Oregon State.
53:38
I learned from Carl Stoltenberg.
53:40
I learned from the other
53:43
people there in jobs like that; John Beuter,
53:49
George Brown.
53:50
[Stoltenberg and Brown were OSU COF deans] And I was really fascinated
53:54
by what many people think of as an oxymoron, academic management.
54:03
So, I got to apply those at Yale, because at Yale,
54:12
unlike Oregon State, which is a very hierarchical, almost
54:16
paramilitary kind of institution,
54:22
Yale was Yale College, and had so-called graduate professional schools.
54:27
And
54:30
the graduate professional schools just kind of let you out in the pasture, and
54:33
told, you’ve got to pay your bills, you
54:39
must meet your academic standards for students and faculty, and so, go to it.
54:46
So, it was kind of like running a little business, a little
54:50
$15 million-a-year business.
54:53
And I
54:57
got to use more of the things that I thought I had learned
55:01
at Oregon State and Iowa State.
55:05
Was that in terms of developing the curriculum there?
55:08
Yeah.
55:10
By that time, I was an enemy of curriculum [strict] , as a concept.
55:15
Okay, define what you mean by that?
55:17
You mean, in terms of curriculum being locked in?
55:20
Yeah, I’d say, “Okay, Fred, you need two of these and four
55:23
of those, and one of these.”
55:27
You know, the argument is, well, if you don’t have a curriculum, then students
55:30
will just take anything. Well, my answer has been, don’t teach anything.
55:35
If you don’t want them to take basket-weaving,
55:36
don’t teach basket-weaving.
55:39
Teach stuff that’s good for ‘em, and then, how can they
55:43
take stuff that’s bad for ‘em?
55:45
And the undergraduate professional school, you know, we had to be sensitive,
55:51
they really have to know some things by the time they get out of there.
55:54
Right, something they can use.
55:56
Yeah, and so you have to make sure that they take that.
56:00
But rigid curriculum is not the only way to do that.
56:03
You can give choices, you could say, you can have two of those and three of
56:07
those, or one of those and four of these.
56:11
And that’s a form of curriculum, but it’s—
56:14
You just loosen the strictures up a little bit, is what you’re saying?
56:18
Yeah, and I think a lot of the learning that goes on in graduate
56:23
school particularly, is from the other students, so you need diversity, you
56:28
need a variety of kinds of people to maximize learning, and you get those
56:34
kinds of people by letting them, to a very large degree, construct their
56:38
own future and their own curriculum.
56:42
I think it works.
56:46
But I got to try it out anyway.
56:50
At the same time, we were able to grow and
56:57
change.
57:00
We added a thing called the Tropical Resources Institute, to give our students
57:06
a chance to go other places and do other kinds of forestry and environmental
57:11
things, and to bring in people from other countries to make that mix work.
57:18
And Yale’s reach, and also, the endowments, made it possible
57:23
to do some more assertive international work, correct?
57:27
In the beginning, it was almost all grants.
57:30
Okay.
57:31
Particularly, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and several others,
57:37
who provided the venture capital.
57:42
But I learned that, I think, at Oregon State, where there
57:44
wasn’t any venture capital.
57:46
All you had was appropriations and tuition.
57:50
And the appropriations even then, were on the way out.
57:53
Yeah, we were at the point where the public institution funding calculus
57:59
was already in a downward slide.
58:01
Right?
58:01
Yeah.
58:05
But at Yale, it was easier to raise money, just because of the name and
58:10
reputation, and because it was private.
58:12
It didn’t have any legislative source.
58:15
If you go out to raise money for a public institution, and my hat’s off
58:20
to people who do it, because the first thing that a donor says is what did you
58:23
do with the money the government gave you, how come you can’t live on that?
58:29
They couldn’t say that
58:32
at Yale.
58:34
Can I go back and ask you a question about Oregon State, before we move
58:37
on to the Northwest Forest Plan?
58:38
We’re getting close chronologically.
58:40
Yeah.
58:41
The one thing that impresses me about Oregon State is its close physical
58:47
proximity, but also cross-institutional collaborative dynamic between the Forest
58:53
Service, other federal institutions, and the college of forestry, but
58:58
also like you said, with the spectrum of earth science departments.
59:04
What would you have to say about OSU in terms of that dynamic?
59:08
Oh, it was excellent.
59:09
It was a great source of strength.
59:11
That was, you know, Tarrant’s comment about the greatest
59:14
concentration of forestry researchers.
59:15
Right, right.
59:16
He didn’t mean just forestry; he meant forestry, wildlife, geology, geochemistry,
59:20
that whole bag of tricks, statistics.
59:24
And
59:27
Oregon State was
59:32
very open to that kind of boundary crossing with some exceptions, and
59:40
at
59:44
Yale, things tended to happen if there wasn’t in those days, much structure,
59:54
and so you could pretty well do whatever you wanted to do in that regard.
1:00:01
We established joint programs with the business school, epidemiology and
1:00:07
public health, development economics,
1:00:11
the Connecticut Ag [Agricultural] Experiment Station; I don’t know,
1:00:15
there were a couple others, but we had a lot of joint programs.
1:00:20
You’re teaching and you’re back at Yale now.
1:00:24
How did you see professors and students growing in understandings of it, seeing
1:00:32
differences between managing natural resources, forests and otherwise, and
1:00:37
the various biomes in geographies of North America and the United States.
1:00:42
I mean, there are vast differences between here in the Northwest and the
1:00:46
Northeast, the Appalachians, in terms of private and public lands, those things.
1:00:51
How did you like to see that taught in terms of people understanding that matrix?
1:01:06
Well, as my friend, Clark Binkley, who was at Yale then, said, “Yale was in New
1:01:14
Haven, but not of New England.” So, we tried to have people, and they did, come
1:01:24
from a variety of places and to work on lots of different places. So, there was
1:01:33
no real parochial New England thing there,
1:01:39
that, unlike in the old days here,
1:01:46
when I got to the college of forestry, it wasn’t just an Oregon forestry school,
1:01:51
it was a westside Oregon forestry school.
1:01:54
You mean, like wet forests?
1:01:55
Like, wet forests, like the Cascade west.
1:01:58
Right, and the Coast Range, right?
1:01:59
Saltwater.
1:02:00
Right, okay, I got you.
1:02:01
And—
1:02:02
And so, who was teaching the dry forest stuff here in the West?
1:02:08
We had a professor of pine silviculture, a nice guy, I can’t remember
1:02:14
his name, but that was about it.
1:02:18
We didn’t pay a whole lot of attention to the east side.
1:02:22
So, you’d probably be looking at University of Montana, Northern Arizona
1:02:25
University, Idaho [University of]
1:02:29
. Idaho, particularly.
1:02:29
Yeah, but would be the ones that were taking care of shall we say, east
1:02:33
of the Cascade ridge type ecology, that biome, and then you were
1:02:38
taking care of the wet, west side.
1:02:40
I mean, that’s fair to say?
1:02:41
Right.
1:02:42
And it’s changed a lot.
1:02:44
And it was changing at that time.
1:02:47
Right.
1:02:47
That was the heritage.
1:02:49
One of my favorite student stories was, we had a good master’s student in
1:02:54
our Department of Forest Science, who said, “Well, I particularly want an
1:02:59
industry job.” This was in the timber depression about ’81, and there were
1:03:05
very few. So, we went out, I went out and beat the bushes as it were, and
1:03:11
it turned out the Potlatch had a job
1:03:16
over in Idaho. And I said, “Oh, you’re in luck.
1:03:20
Just go see them.” So, he came back, and I said, “Did you take the job?” He
1:03:24
said, “Well, they offered it to me, but I didn’t take it.” And I said, “What?”
1:03:29
And he said, “Yeah, I wanted to work in the Pacific Northwest.” So, this was in
1:03:35
western Idaho, which didn’t qualify as
1:03:41
what was Northwest.
1:03:41
[for him]
1:03:42
You were originally from that area, weren’t you?
1:03:45
Well, I was born there, but I didn’t know anything about it.
1:03:48
But you didn’t spend any time there?
1:03:51
But it’s funny how you talk about regions and associations with
1:03:54
what is the Pacific Northwest.
1:03:56
A lot of people consider Idaho the Pacific Northwest, and then, other people, don’t.
1:04:01
Yeah, that’s right.
1:04:02
Well, this kid obviously didn’t, so.
1:04:04
Yeah.
1:04:05
So, regionalisms and how we perceive things, it really does
1:04:10
have an effect on politics, on economics, science, how we do things.
1:04:17
Well, that’s one of the things I learned at Oregon State, and it was pretty
1:04:22
true with Yale, was that science and science ideas flow north and south
1:04:28
a lot better than they flow east
1:04:33
and west.
1:04:33
Could you describe and clarify that?
1:04:35
Well, we had, at Oregon State, we had in those days very close ties with not only
1:04:43
Berkeley and the University of Washington forestry people, but also British
1:04:48
Columbia, University of British Columbia.
1:04:51
So, things, people and ideas, went up and down that corridor.
1:04:58
And it was pretty similar on the East Coast, it just didn’t
1:05:05
cover quite that much distance
1:05:09
linearly.
1:05:09
Interesting, interesting.
1:05:11
So, let me think about this.
1:05:13
So, you’re at Yale in the ‘80s and I’m going to ask you this because
1:05:20
we’re going to go into the Northwest Forest Plan dynamics shortly.
1:05:23
You
1:05:25
saw the beginnings of the “Forest Wars” [Debate over clearcutting federal lands]
1:05:28
and that whole schism, and the whole thing changing. And the owl was, by the
1:05:33
early ‘80s, it was known that the owl was an indicator species and it was going
1:05:37
to be listed, but it hadn’t been yet listed, and then it was during the ‘80s.
1:05:41
Right.
1:05:41
As you’re watching this from Yale, what do you remember thinking about
1:05:45
this, “Hum, I wonder what’s going to happen out there,” which preceded your
1:05:49
involvement in the Gang of Four and the whole Northwest Forest Plan process?
1:05:53
What got you involved in that whole deal?
1:05:54
Well, my involvement actually began with that SAF [Society of American
1:05:57
Foresters] study that was launched by Jim Lyons, and which had most,
1:06:02
the rest of us old-duffers in it.
1:06:04
And then at Yale, of course, it was a hot topic, and we had all sorts of speakers
1:06:10
on all sides when the questions came in.
1:06:13
About the Endangered Species Act?
1:06:14
Yeah, the Endangered Species Act, the specific old-growth controversies.
1:06:21
A lot of people came and talked about how you do environmental activism; lawyers and
1:06:29
other folks.
1:06:30
And so, it was very much “on the boil” at Yale all during the ‘80s.
1:06:38
And, you tie this into the—what was it, the snail darter at the Tellico
1:06:43
Dam [Tennessee] , the whooping crane [Nebraska] , kind of the immediate
1:06:47
predecessors, and you even have to go back to the Migratory Bird Act to see some
1:06:52
of the ways it all got tied in, because I believe the spotted owl was actually
1:06:56
in that treaty at one time, in the ‘30s?
1:06:59
It could well have been.
1:06:59
Yeah, I’ve been reading a little bit up on this lately and how all these things
1:07:04
are interconnected long before Earth Day.
1:07:08
Yeah.
1:07:09
And the environmental age.
1:07:10
Yeah, and a lot of that went on while I was at Iowa State.
1:07:13
Right.
1:07:14
For example, it
1:07:19
was there and it was a presence.
1:07:20
And we had one visiting lecturer, Rick Boyce, who was a biologist and
1:07:28
butterfly guy, actually, but lived in the Northwest, and who was very interested
1:07:33
in the spotted owl controversy and very much opposed to any kind of timber
1:07:36
harvest, at least on public lands.
1:07:39
But he gave a talk that I’ll never forget.
1:07:41
He said, “You wait and see, the spotted owl is going away, no matter
1:07:44
what we do.” And he was kind of mysterious about it, but he said,
1:07:48
“They’re not a sustainable species.
1:07:52
They’re a relic of, you know, glacial margin, or whatever, and they’re gonna
1:07:57
go.” And I thought, “Uh, all this fuss.” But I didn’t know what he was talking
1:08:04
about until we realized what the barred owl was up to, so he had a point.
1:08:11
But there was nobody to listen to it at that time.
1:08:12
Now, the barred owl is showing that Darwinian dynamics [natural
1:08:18
selection] are often bigger than all of us together, right?
1:08:21
[Laughs]
1:08:21
Right.
1:08:22
Yeah, and the whole, I’m very skeptical.
1:08:28
I guess, I was solidified in this, probably instructed by Jack Ward
1:08:33
Thomas, that species plus species preservation, is a loser ultimately.
1:08:42
And I still think so.
1:08:46
You’ve got to work on habitat
1:08:49
in general, not crafting it for each mouse and each owl.
1:08:56
I just think it is part of the reason that you had, number one, the real
1:09:01
dynamic of creating indicator species, which is one way of measuring or seeing
1:09:06
effects, and then tying a specific species to a legal paradigm which
1:09:11
also goes to a cultural/political paradigm, and becomes a weapon.
1:09:16
Sure.
1:09:17
And then it becomes a symbol.
1:09:20
Yeah, and when the environmental activists would come to lecture to
1:09:23
us at Yale, that’s exactly what they instructed, here’s how we do that.
1:09:27
And that’s fine.
1:09:28
I mean, that’s politics, but it’s not biology, and
1:09:33
it’s not very good biology, I don’t think.
1:09:34
But,
1:09:38
I guess, I was involved all through from, gosh, decades, on these
1:09:47
questions, and on various panels and commissions and the alphabet soup that
1:09:55
was supposed to construe about them.
1:09:57
So, how do you remember old-growth forests?
1:10:01
They called it “virgin forests,” there’s been a lot of different names
1:10:04
for it, being taught or conceived within the professional community
1:10:08
at the beginning of your career,
1:10:12
and how did that evolve?
1:10:13
I mean, obviously, you met Jerry Franklin, who’s called the “guru” of
1:10:17
old growth and all that stuff, but I mean, it’s a lot more complex than that.
1:10:21
But how do you remember the evolution of what you originally thought it
1:10:24
was, were taught about what it was, and how you came to understand it?
1:10:30
Well, as I mentioned, I thought from childhood, that big-old trees were really
1:10:35
special, I wasn’t exclusive to conifers like Jerry, but I liked big-old trees.
1:10:41
But at the beginning of my career, the problem was how do you get
1:10:45
rid of old growth, how do you get to a sustained-yield level where
1:10:48
you have balanced age classes to produce wood continuously?
1:10:53
An economic model.
1:10:54
Yeah, an economic model.
1:10:56
Actually, sort of an economic model, anyway.
1:10:59
Well,
1:11:01
it’s a little of both.
1:11:02
Anyway, it was the way you did forestry.
1:11:05
And to do that, if you had a lot of old, slow-growing trees, you
1:11:09
wanted to get rid of them, so you had young fast-growing trees.
1:11:12
That was how you wound up with these huge harvests where you had an age imbalance.
1:11:19
Where you had it according to that model, and where you had a lot of old
1:11:24
trees and not very many young trees, you had to get rid of the old trees
1:11:27
to make room for the young trees.
1:11:29
To increase productivity?
1:11:29
Increase productivity and to keep the forest healthy.
1:11:33
Right.
1:11:34
So, that was where I started out in forestry.
1:11:38
And now, a lot of people in places say, well, you cut the
1:11:46
young trees and you leave the old trees, which is the opposite.
1:11:51
So, that’s a big difference.
1:11:56
When did you first start talking to the people that became the Gang
1:11:59
of Four, and what was the lead-in to you becoming involved with the
1:12:05
congressional hearings, and beginning of the planning [NWFP] process?
1:12:10
It was really that SAF study.
1:12:12
Have you ever seen that?
1:12:14
It was called “Scheduling the Harvest of Old-Growth Timber.”
1:12:18
I’m not sure I’ve seen it.
1:12:19
What we wound up with, and Jim Lyons was the SAF policy person, and he
1:12:24
later became the congressional staffer who put together the Gang of Four.
1:12:30
And so, that’s the continuity for me.
1:12:34
You knew Jerry Franklin, you knew Norm Johnson, you knew Jack [Ward
1:12:40
Thomas] , so you guys were already compadres, professionally at least?
1:12:43
To some degree.
1:12:44
But you knew each other?
1:12:45
Yeah.
1:12:46
And technically, Jerry, by his courtesy appointment, was in
1:12:50
my department at Oregon State.
1:12:52
Right, before he went up to UW [Washington] , later on, right?
1:12:56
Right.
1:12:58
So,
1:13:02
there’s lawsuits, but the big one was the Seattle Audubon Society lawsuit
1:13:06
which led to the listing [ESA-spotted owl] , and then it led to the injunction.
1:13:17
I just handed to John what’s often called the “Gang of Four
1:13:21
Report,” which is not the title.
1:13:22
Do you want to read it off?
1:13:24
“Alternatives to Management of Late Successional Forests of the Pacific
1:13:28
Northwest or Reported to the Agriculture Committee and the Merchant Marine and
1:13:31
Fisheries Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, by the Scientific Panel
1:13:36
on Late Successional Forest Ecosystems.”
1:13:38
Now, what do you remember about working on that document and the
1:13:42
research behind it, and compiling this?
1:13:47
Well, it was a pretty intense exercise.
1:13:50
The
1:13:52
thing I remember the most, and I think it was Jerry Franklin’s idea,
1:13:57
was that we got together staff from all federal forest units in sort
1:14:04
of a geographically correct array
1:14:10
in the Coliseum [Memorial] here in Portland, and had everybody do the
1:14:16
analysis on their part, and with the elements we had determined that ought
1:14:23
to be included in a new plan, late successional reserves, corridors, etc. And
1:14:31
that was one of the most creative ideas I think I’ve ever heard about in forestry.
1:14:37
And as I say, I think it was Jerry Franklin that came up with that.
1:14:40
You mean, the kind of—
1:14:42
Get the people all together in the same room.
1:14:45
In other words, collaborative “encampment,” if you will.
1:14:47
Right?
1:14:47
Yeah, and the geographic correctness, so that,
1:14:53
if you’re a Forest Service person with a BLM chunk next-door, you can just walk
1:14:58
over to their table and say, “What do you have here? What, how do you do this?”
1:15:05
And so, that was fascinating.
1:15:07
That’s my, other than the congressional testimony, is my most vivid memory.
1:15:13
And also, if I remember, I think people showing up from industry associations,
1:15:20
and indeed from federal land management agencies, administrators, trying to—
1:15:31
Lobby?
1:15:32
Lobby, if not disrupt, what was going on.
1:15:36
So, in other words, the rules of the game that would happen two years later [FEMAT]
1:15:41
in the “pink tower” [U.S. Bank Building] here in downtown came about in large part,
1:15:46
because of what you’re just talking about.
1:15:47
I think so.
1:15:48
I believe you had to wear, a fluorescent traffic vest and badges if
1:15:54
you were, one of the “other” people?
1:15:58
Correct?
1:15:58
Yeah, and
1:16:01
I think we told several high-ranking federal people, they couldn’t come in.
1:16:08
I remember that.
1:16:09
And I know,
1:16:12
there was one fellow, who was an industry association representative,
1:16:16
and I don’t remember his name, but he got really nasty and personal.
1:16:25
People felt very strongly about that, and everybody assumed,
1:16:31
and they were right, that
1:16:35
the timber harvest would come down drastically on federal
1:16:39
land if any of this became rule.
1:16:44
So, people were stirred up about it.
1:16:47
And of course, when this was going on, the injunction had already taken effect.
1:16:52
So, essentially, new sales and harvests were shut off for the time being.
1:16:59
Correct?
1:16:59
Yeah, that was the whole reason for the exercise, as far as I can tell.
1:17:02
To basically get something done quickly?
1:17:04
To get something done quickly to get the injunction lifted.
1:17:07
Which it didn’t—
1:17:08
Why more people didn’t see that, I don’t know.
1:17:14
It’s almost like they thought you were plotting some secret
1:17:16
takeover of the federal lands.
1:17:17
You were actually trying to free things up, so something could happen.
1:17:21
Right?
1:17:22
Yeah, that’s right.
1:17:23
And, you know, Tom Tuchman wrote a resume of the forest plan and from the
1:17:32
regional ecosystem office point-of-view, and he points out quite correctly
1:17:37
that it was done to get the injunction lifted, and the injunction got lifted.
1:17:42
So there.
1:17:44
But many people saw it and still see it, I think, as kind of a personal insult
1:17:53
or thing that shouldn’t have been done.
1:17:56
You’re talking about the fact that they did this, well, I’m not going to
1:18:00
call “closed door,” but they did this thing over there in this—how long did
1:18:04
it last, was it thirty days, two weeks?
1:18:08
The Gang of Four, I don’t remember.
1:18:10
I am talking about the first one at the Coliseum?
1:18:13
Oh, just a few days.
1:18:15
Oh, okay, because I know the pink tower was sixty, and then
1:18:18
it was extended to ninety.
1:18:19
Correct?
1:18:20
Ninety days?
1:18:20
Well, I wasn’t involved in the Pink Tower.
1:18:22
Oh, you weren’t?
1:18:24
Okay.
1:18:25
No, I was an “auslander” [German for outsider] . I think
1:18:27
everybody had to be from Oregon or Washington to get into there.
1:18:31
Okay, I got you.
1:18:32
And no, I couldn’t.
1:18:35
I had a full-time job.
1:18:36
I couldn’t go sit [long period]
1:18:38
. What was your greatest contribution to this report, really the report
1:18:44
that was the foundation for FEMAT, and
1:18:49
the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:18:51
The ideas and concepts were already there, they were going to be shaped-out into
1:18:57
what’s what, how much is this and how much is that; that still had to be determined.
1:19:01
But the main ideas were put in place during this?
1:19:04
Correct?
1:19:04
Yeah, that’s really the synthesis.
1:19:06
I think I came up with the idea of a “matrix” [one zoning category in
1:19:11
Northwest Forest Plan] approach, where you’d say, okay, you do these
1:19:13
things, and then you get these things.
1:19:16
And
1:19:18
we wound with however many options.
1:19:20
I
1:19:24
think that structure persisted through the whole process until
1:19:29
the forest plan was completed.
1:19:31
Well, you had the Late Successional Old-Growth Reserves, you had the Riparian
1:19:35
Reserves and the buffer zones, and you had the Matrix areas and the AMA’s, [Adaptive
1:19:39
Management Areas] and what am I missing?
1:19:42
[Northwest Forest Plan Zoning Categories in caps] There’s another one.
1:19:43
Yeah, the AMA’s were the part that never got done, and that’s too bad.
1:19:51
Well, they
1:19:55
were put out there for many different reasons, but only a couple of
1:20:00
them ever had much action on them [Applegate in Southern Oregon,
1:20:02
Central Cascades near H.J. Andrews Forest] , and they just kind of fizzled.
1:20:03
Well, and they got, they were supposed to be places where you had more latitude
1:20:07
in action than on the Matrix lands.
1:20:12
They wound up being places for various reasons, mostly opposition
1:20:17
from environmental groups, where you had less latitude in action.
1:20:21
So, that was too bad, but it was a synthesis effort, as you say,
1:20:27
the ideas were there and this was putting them together in different
1:20:31
ways to see which mix made sense.
1:20:34
And I think it did guide the final plan in many ways.
1:20:41
As far as saying what I did and what others did, it’s really hard, particularly
1:20:46
at this distance in time, for me to pick it apart and say, well, I did
1:20:49
this, because I don’t really know.
1:20:52
In general
1:20:55
and conceptually, how did your presence affect the process, and what do you
1:20:58
think the most important thing was in terms of your impact on this process?
1:21:03
You talked about the Matrix already.
1:21:07
I think that’s probably it.
1:21:10
I think
1:21:15
I was perhaps the most friendly toward timber harvest on federal lands
1:21:26
in this group,
1:21:29
probably not too different than Jack Ward Thomas.
1:21:34
So, I think
1:21:38
I contributed that perspective.
1:21:40
And then, when it came to the transmitting the thing to Congress,
1:21:47
who if I remember, that’s who we were talking to at this juncture.
1:21:50
At that time, yeah.
1:21:57
My statement was, okay, you pick one of these and you will probably
1:22:06
do a lot better than we’re doing now, but you’ve got to pick.
1:22:11
We’ve done the science, now you do the politics.
1:22:17
They didn’t, and got mad about that.
1:22:21
Who was that?
1:22:24
Who got mad?
1:22:27
Well,
1:22:29
the one I remember is Norm Dicks, who was a congressman from Washington.
1:22:34
But it was a general opinion,
1:22:40
I remember they
1:22:47
were saying, “Can’t we have this timber and this certainty, about wildlife,”
1:22:54
even though they did not match?
1:22:57
I said, “Well, there’s no free lunch.” I
1:23:02
think it was a Congressman from Oregon, I can’t remember his name, who said, “I
1:23:06
don’t see any lunch here at all,” which I thought was a pretty smart comment.
1:23:12
Les Au Coin, was he there then?
1:23:14
It wasn’t Au Coin.
1:23:15
Was there a Smith there?
1:23:18
Well, Gordon Smith was a senator.
1:23:20
No, not Gordon Smith.
1:23:21
He was a senator later.
1:23:22
Yeah, I know him.
1:23:23
A different one.
1:23:25
I’d have to look back.
1:23:26
[Denny Smith, R-Oregon, 5th Cong.
1:23:26
Dist., 1983-90]
1:23:26
Anyway, who knows at this stage?
1:23:29
What
1:23:32
do you remember about the congressional hearings?
1:23:35
The thing I remember the most didn’t come from the hearings
1:23:42
per se, it was during the meeting that Clinton had here in Portland.
1:23:47
Oh, the “Summit,” yeah.
1:23:49
[April]
1:23:49
So, I was going down the hall, and there was Charlie Bingham, the Executive
1:23:52
Director of Weyerhaeuser, who was a friend of mine, and he said, “Well,
1:24:00
you know, all we care about in this is that you
1:24:05
just stay out of private land, and do whatever else you want.” And I said,
1:24:12
“Weren’t you at the hearing when we presented the Gang of Four?” He said,
1:24:16
“Yeah.” And said, “Did you hear Jack Ward Thomas say that if Congress will
1:24:24
legislate this on forest land, on federal land, he thinks the spotted owl will be
1:24:34
delisted?” Charlie just looked like he’d been hit by lightning, and
1:24:37
said, “No, he didn’t say that.” And I said, “Look in the record, if
1:24:45
you guys had turned your congressman loose, this owl might be history
1:24:50
now.” You know, the owl controversy.
1:24:53
He couldn’t believe it.
1:24:55
But that’s true, and I know that’s true because I sat next to
1:25:01
Jack when he said it under oath.
1:25:05
So, he meant that if this plan or these ideas were used, that it would
1:25:13
lead to the delisting of the owl?
1:25:17
That’s right.
1:25:18
Because it would save enough environment so you could no longer make the argument
1:25:22
there wasn’t sufficient habitat?
1:25:24
The owl would not go extinct.
1:25:26
Okay.
1:25:26
I mean, Jack knew more about that than anybody after those
1:25:30
“umpty-ump” [many or lots] exercises in modeling owl populations.
1:25:39
The other thing I remember about the congressional charge was—when we
1:25:46
were talking to Congressman Volkmer [Harold, D-Missouri] , who was on
1:25:50
the House Subcommittee on Forest and Fisheries, I think, for the Ag Committee.
1:25:57
He was from the Midwest.
1:25:58
Yeah, he’s from Missouri.
1:25:59
Right.
1:26:00
So, we’re almost walking out of the office, and he said, “And remember,
1:26:06
don’t let us get blindsided by no damn fish.” That really what was interjected
1:26:12
into the broad construction of the Gang of Four report, and when we picked
1:26:21
up Gordie Reeves and Jim Sedell to
1:26:25
work on the fish part.
1:26:27
In other words, the Gang of Four became the “Gang of Four Plus Two.”
1:26:31
[Original Gang of Four – Jerry Franklin, Norm Johnson, Jack Ward
1:26:31
Thomas, and John Gordon: Two added, Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves.]
1:26:31
Yeah, it was really should have been Gang of Six, and then
1:26:33
probably Gang of a Thousand after everybody got done working on it.
1:26:38
That makes perfect sense that if you think about it, the terrestrial and the aquatic
1:26:45
are together, and you’re in the Northwest, where fisheries are kind of a big deal.
1:26:50
It always struck me as interesting that it was a guy from Missouri
1:26:52
who pointed that out to us.
1:26:55
Sometimes, it takes somebody “outside the pond” just to see what’s going on.
1:27:02
Now, I was told by Gordie and others, that
1:27:07
when he was back there, Gordie testified along with, was it Jim?
1:27:13
[Sedell]
1:27:13
I think so.
1:27:15
And that there were some rather unhappy folks in the Forest Service
1:27:20
that this new major element had been interjected into this process midstream?
1:27:27
Oh, yeah.
1:27:30
A lot of people wanted it just to be about timber, one way or the other,
1:27:33
even some on the environmental side.
1:27:33
Right.
1:27:36
But,
1:27:38
yeah.
1:27:40
What do you think that did to the whole process scientifically,
1:27:44
but also politically?
1:27:49
Well, for one thing, it was a political process.
1:27:54
From beginning to end, or beginning to now, it’s politics.
1:28:01
And I think that’s inevitable, you know.
1:28:07
This idea that scientists can say what’s right and it’s
1:28:12
everybody else’s duty to do it,
1:28:17
shouldn’t really be the case in a democracy, it seems to me.
1:28:27
People say the scientific results were politicized.
1:28:31
It’s inevitable, I think.
1:28:34
Well, when people are involved, politics are involved.
1:28:38
And it doesn’t matter, as there is no pure process that’s free of
1:28:42
politics, even if it’s not in the mainstream political arena, per se.
1:28:48
No.
1:28:51
The other people on the Gang of Four, just a little bit about your experiences
1:28:55
and interactions with them professionally over the years, specifically on the Forest
1:28:59
Plan, and starting with Jack Ward Thomas.
1:29:01
Just tell me a little about Jack and what you knew of him, and his
1:29:07
influence in science and policy?
1:29:12
I knew him first when he was a researcher in eastern Oregon
1:29:16
working on elk, as I recall.
1:29:18
And he’d been other places, including New England, and had a very strong reputation
1:29:28
at that time as a wildlife scientist.
1:29:31
And
1:29:34
I always found him
1:29:39
really easy to work with, real straight-forward.
1:29:42
If he disagreed with you, he’d tell you, but he’d be willing to listen.
1:29:49
He
1:29:53
had not only a tremendous font of knowledge, but was very good at
1:29:58
summarizing, at putting together the kernels at the heart of something.
1:30:04
In other words, bringing it together in like something like this.
1:30:07
Yeah, in one graph or one sentence, what this was about.
1:30:11
He’s a very good speaker.
1:30:18
And he was, it’s
1:30:22
not too much I think to say, he was a great leader in natural
1:30:26
resources, natural resource science.
1:30:28
Well, it’s no accident that he was kind of the lead guy in this.
1:30:33
Correct?
1:30:34
Well, I still think that—
1:30:35
Or is that not true?
1:30:36
He said that.
1:30:37
Oh, I don’t know, I’m just saying—
1:30:38
No, he did.
1:30:39
[In FEMAT process, he was designated lead person]
1:30:41
Well, okay.
1:30:41
Actually, I think the lead guy in terms of providing the glue
1:30:47
and so on, was Norm Johnson.
1:30:53
That’s my opinion, for what it’s worth.
1:30:56
But
1:30:59
Jack brought something.
1:31:00
He had a real presence to him?
1:31:03
He had a presence and he was
1:31:06
just a good guy to have on your side, you know what I mean?
1:31:10
He was very vocal.
1:31:12
Vocal in a telling way.
1:31:15
He wasn’t a gas-bag, but he did make his points clear.
1:31:22
What were, do you think, the main points he made in the whole Northwest
1:31:27
Forest Plan process, if you were going to crystalize one or two things?
1:31:32
It’s hard to do, as I say, to pick it apart, because it
1:31:35
really was a synthesis effort.
1:31:37
But
1:31:42
his knowledge of the owl was a key.
1:31:47
He had all the facts after the “God Squad” [BLM/US F& WL] and all those things.
1:31:53
And
1:31:57
then
1:31:59
his testimony.
1:32:02
I think he got listened to more than any of us in Congress.
1:32:06
And you’re talking about at the congressional hearings.
1:32:08
I’m talking about the congressional hearings.
1:32:10
And you know, I really don’t know much about the—
1:32:14
FEMAT process?
1:32:15
FEMAT process.
1:32:21
Yeah.
1:32:22
He gave strong testimony in Congress, and they listened.
1:32:27
Well, they didn’t listen closely enough, or their supporters
1:32:34
didn’t listen closely enough.
1:32:37
Because, I couldn’t believe it when I heard Jack say, we think
1:32:40
we can get the owl delisted.
1:32:41
I thought there’d be confetti and champagne, and it just fell flat.
1:32:51
Well, it’s obvious.
1:32:51
I guess by that time probably, I don’t know this, but that Congress
1:32:55
had decided they weren’t going to do anything, and this is the third
1:32:58
rail they weren’t going to touch.
1:33:01
So, they were having the hearings?
1:33:03
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
1:33:05
Exactly.
1:33:05
I think one of the best things in the hearing came from Norm Dicks
1:33:09
[D-Washington] , who, when we were giving him the alternatives and how
1:33:13
much timber they’d give up to get this level of protection, said, “I told
1:33:19
you guys you should have liked the owl report,” in which they called for much
1:33:23
lower reduction of timber harvest.
1:33:26
That was the 1988 report, I believe.
1:33:27
There were two or three of them.
1:33:30
I think so.
1:33:31
Anyway.
1:33:32
What about Jerry Franklin?
1:33:36
Since I’ve been involved with the Andrews Forest, he’s kind of
1:33:39
the big name that came out of the Andrews, and he’s the old-growth guy.
1:33:47
Tell me about you knowing Jerry and working with him, in
1:33:51
general, both before this [NWFP process] and in regards to this.
1:33:55
There are times when Jerry can be a little hard to work with, but he’s a visionary.
1:34:01
And he is the most effective advocate of big-old conifers that I’ve ever run
1:34:06
across, and I’ve run across a lot of
1:34:10
them.
1:34:11
He has always taken kind of a taxonomic approach to science,
1:34:16
and he thinks that way.
1:34:21
It’s a pretty handy way to think, even politically, to kind of
1:34:27
think of categories of things and how they relate to each other.
1:34:32
And he’s an innovator.
1:34:35
He came up with this idea of having all the people in a gymnasium
1:34:41
in a geographic arrangement.
1:34:43
[Gang of Four planning mtg.]
1:34:45
And that same idea was carried through to the “pink tower.” [FEMAT]
1:34:47
I think it was, yeah.
1:34:48
Maybe that was his idea
1:34:52
that led to an even bigger idea with the pink tower?
1:34:54
[FEMAT planning session in Portland over ninety days]
1:34:55
But I think his principal role was as
1:35:01
a visionary, who had a very clear vision of the role of old forests,
1:35:06
and why they were good for something, and he could communicate it.
1:35:13
He’s kind of almost a missionary in a certain sense?
1:35:17
Oh, yeah.
1:35:18
He’s definitely an old forest advocate.
1:35:21
And
1:35:29
he’s pretty astute about politics.
1:35:35
Talk to me about Norm Johnson?
1:35:37
Brilliant guy, brilliant.
1:35:42
I mean, his thing is planning, but he’s done much more than that.
1:35:47
Yeah, and he knows a lot about everything to do with forests and forestry.
1:35:53
His forte is planning, but it’s really about understanding rules and
1:35:59
regulations, how they take effect, and why they have a given effect.
1:36:06
I’d say, that’s his forte.
1:36:08
And that really had a lot to do with the structure of this
1:36:13
report, the Gang of Four report.
1:36:15
I mean, he not only wrote a lot of it, but he
1:36:21
took an approach that, to me, should have been very understandable
1:36:25
to regulatory people, as well as scientific sorts of people.
1:36:33
He has been all, ever since I’ve known him, an advocate of quantitative measures
1:36:38
of outcomes and quantitative measures of inputs, some of which I disagree with.
1:36:43
But he’s a very disciplined thinker.
1:36:52
So, you say that his fingerprints are as strong as anybody, at
1:36:57
least on this document, certainly.
1:36:59
Well, to me, he was the guy who really studied the process,
1:37:03
and then, really absorbed the outcome and knew all the nuances.
1:37:12
Now, the 1976 [National] Forest Management Act was what was trying to be implemented,
1:37:21
forest by forest by forest [each national forest] , coming up to this whole process.
1:37:25
And right as they were starting to finally get all their forest
1:37:29
plans done, boom, a bomb hits.
1:37:33
What do you think that did to the Forest Service at the regional and
1:37:37
national levels, but even at the district and forest levels, in terms
1:37:41
of all that work, and then, kaboom, it didn’t really come to pass, because
1:37:45
society said this isn’t good enough?
1:37:48
Yeah, well, I think regardless of the Northwest Forest Plan,
1:37:51
it wasn’t going to work anyway.
1:37:54
You’re talking about the previous plans, the forest-by-forest plans?
1:37:58
Yeah.
1:37:58
And that was because it wasn’t including--?
1:38:01
It wasn’t integrated.
1:38:04
One forest didn’t necessarily have anything to do with the next forest
1:38:07
and the next piece of federal land [BLM/NPS] that wasn’t in their agency.
1:38:11
And the idea that you can specify inputs carefully enough so that you know exactly
1:38:19
what output you get, is a wrong idea.
1:38:22
It was the golden age of computer-based planning in the old sense.
1:38:28
And Norm developed FORPLAN, this idea that you get, if you got good
1:38:36
enough at specifying the inputs, you can know exactly what the outputs
1:38:39
were, which we weren’t anywhere near sophisticated enough to do in those days.
1:38:47
You’re talking about nutrients, biomass, etc.?
1:38:49
I’m talking about measured inputs, you can say, okay, here’s
1:38:52
how much growing stock and—
1:38:54
Oh, you’re talking about—
1:38:55
And here’s what aspect of slope and—
1:38:58
Right, and it still wasn’t developed enough then?
1:39:03
And I don’t think it is now.
1:39:04
I think that kind of forest planning has seen its day.
1:39:11
But, I don’t think it was the Northwest Forest Plan that finished it off.
1:39:15
I think it fell on its own weight.
1:39:17
You think, because it was not impossible, but impractical in the real world?
1:39:25
Yes.
1:39:25
To qualitatively quantify many things in that complex matrix, meaning
1:39:34
the ecology of something or a place or a region, it was just too much.
1:39:38
Yeah, I think that’s correct, and that it was also too circumscribed.
1:39:44
In terms of forest-by-forest.
1:39:45
Yeah.
1:39:45
In other words, the very shortcomings of us realizing how
1:39:49
arbitrary political boundaries are.
1:39:52
Well, it’s classic silviculture to say you have to work at the stand level.
1:39:57
Right.
1:39:58
Well, that’s a lot smaller than a forest level.
1:40:01
Right.
1:40:02
So,
1:40:05
in a way, I think that it kind of was the fallacy of the middle.
1:40:10
We didn’t want to go right down to the stand level, whatever, 40, 100 acres, and
1:40:17
we were afraid to go to the region level.
1:40:21
And then, there’s the landscape level, however you define that.
1:40:24
How do you define “landscape,” by the way?
1:40:26
Well, one of the books I have my name on, says it’s about 100,000 acres.
1:40:31
But who knows?
1:40:35
It’s bigger,
1:40:38
and depending on the specific landscape which matters, I’d
1:40:45
say it’s anywhere from 50,000 to 350,000 acres, that kind of area.
1:40:52
But the idea really isn’t about boundaries, the idea is about how
1:40:58
the landscape works, how one chunk relates to another, and our western
1:41:07
tradition and resource management is to break it up into pieces, like
1:41:10
we’ve got water and wood and wildlife, and that’s not really how it works.
1:41:18
You need other sets of measures, and the thing that I have talked the most
1:41:24
about, is using overall net primary productivity, and then seeing how
1:41:32
that flows into different things,
1:41:36
some of which can be competing, some of which may not be.
1:41:43
I think we need a new planning idea, other than zoning and landscape
1:41:49
construed as acreage in a kind of zoning.
1:41:56
We’ve been going against those ideas ever since Powell [John Wesley] . For instance,
1:42:04
he criticized how we were dividing up
1:42:09
hydrological areas [politically] , and he said this is ridiculous
1:42:12
because this isn’t how water works.
1:42:13
Right?
1:42:14
And that’s the most basic idea in my experience, when we
1:42:18
started coming up with that.
1:42:20
Well, okay, that doesn’t work, let’s go to this level.
1:42:22
And you remember how he was rebuffed.
1:42:25
[By Congress in early 1890s for trying to divide West into
1:42:28
hydrological districts by watersheds]
1:42:28
. Exactly, right, yeah.
1:42:28
By Congress.
1:42:28
Yeah, I know.
1:42:28
He was actually fired for it.
1:42:30
And I have studied that and have written about it more than once.
1:42:33
And
1:42:38
there again, in a democracy,
1:42:43
I suppose it should be okay to be wrong.
1:42:46
In other words, when Congress didn’t pay any attention to Powell
1:42:52
after he said the West should be cut up by water, not by rectangular
1:42:57
cadastral survey, they were “right” because they were in political power.
1:43:02
They were wrong scientifically, clearly.
1:43:06
But that’s the way it’s going to happen.
1:43:12
It’s called the human condition, I’m afraid.
1:43:16
Yeah.
1:43:16
So, you stepped away from the Northwest Forest Plan process after
1:43:24
the hearings in this document.
1:43:26
Correct?
1:43:26
My last direct involvement was to testify at the Clinton hearing in Portland.
1:43:31
[April]
1:43:33
Tell me about the Clinton hearing.
1:43:36
This was televised, and was a big deal.
1:43:40
It was a big deal and it was the first time, far as I know, since
1:43:43
Teddy Roosevelt, that a sitting President convened a forestry meeting.
1:43:49
I believe you’re right.
1:43:50
You know, I don’t even think FDR, I think he passed that all off on the Secretary
1:43:55
Ag [Henry Wallace] and the Forest Service, and Harold Ickes in Interior.
1:43:59
I think FDR’s big forestry idea was to plant a shelter belt in one
1:44:05
fell swoop from Canada to Mexico, which they finally, fortunately,
1:44:09
convinced him wasn’t possible.
1:44:12
So, it was a big deal and was well-done [Clinton
1:44:19
mtg.]
1:44:19
What did you sense about the new regime?
1:44:22
The Reagan years and the Bush years were, especially the early Reagan
1:44:27
years with Watt and all that, were not environmentally friendly.
1:44:30
Did
1:44:34
you sense a sea change that came in with Clinton?
1:44:37
I mean, Bush was more moderate than Reagan, Bush I.
1:44:41
Well, I think it’s going back to normal.
1:44:43
I think Clinton was the last president to exhibit any particular interest
1:44:48
in forestry or natural resources, other than oil, gas, and coal.
1:44:53
Right.
1:44:57
I don’t think Obama’s been very engaged.
1:45:01
He likes to announce new national monuments and stuff, but I don’t think
1:45:08
the countryside is much on his agenda.
1:45:11
I think he’s also been consumed with surviving amongst the
1:45:14
hostile [political] waters, too.
1:45:16
Yeah, I can’t blame him for that.
1:45:16
Yeah, right.
1:45:16
But in any case, Clinton gets a lot of credit in my book for doing that.
1:45:22
Well, he promised it during the campaign, and he did it first thing.
1:45:25
Right?
1:45:25
Yep.
1:45:26
Now, tell me about the details, what you remember about the actual event
1:45:29
itself and what your part was in it?
1:45:32
Well, it was well-orchestrated.
1:45:33
They had twenty hits, like me, and spotted owl guys, and Norm and Jerry.
1:45:42
Jim Sedell was there, too, I believe?
1:45:43
Jim Sedell and a whole bunch of people, and each gave their [points] . He
1:45:50
wanted us to answer the questions, what should we do, and so we told him
1:45:54
mostly the smallest items based on this.
1:46:00
Eric Forsman gave the background on the owl, and his struggles.
1:46:04
I think that’s the part I paid the most attention to.
1:46:09
I listened to some of the testimony, and one of the things that I thought
1:46:12
he did that was very good, was he had some tribal people testify and speak,
1:46:19
which wasn’t very common in those days.
1:46:25
The whole thing was just done professionally, I thought.
1:46:30
And I think it had quite an impact.
1:46:32
People still talk about it, and it was a long time ago.
1:46:35
They’ve got the transcripts, recordings and other stuff at
1:46:39
the Oregon State Library, too.
1:46:40
I’ve seen some of them.
1:46:41
We had a forestry display there that I was part of putting together,
1:46:44
and Jim Sedell’s papers are there.
1:46:49
Anyway, I saw some of that.
1:46:50
But speaking of tribal peoples, you’ve done a lot of work with native interests,
1:46:57
not just in this country, and I’ve heard different opinions about whether they
1:47:04
got their due in the Northwest Forest Plan, or had adequate involvement.
1:47:09
What is your opinion on that?
1:47:11
They’ve certainly done follow-up monitoring studies.
1:47:14
Do you think that their rights and interests were properly prioritized?
1:47:20
Give me your take on that.
1:47:24
To me, and I have to stress, I was not a part of the actual
1:47:30
Northwest Forest Plan creation, after the [Clinton-Gore] meeting.
1:47:39
It was mostly a creature of “ologists”-- scientists and foresters -- and there
1:47:45
wasn’t much public involvement of any kind I ever heard about. There was
1:47:50
supposed to be a component of local communities, but I think it came along
1:47:59
at a time when you could still get away with that, not involving very
1:48:05
many people other than the in-crowd.
1:48:09
I don’t think it would be done that way today.
1:48:11
Look at the forest collaboratives that are springing up, a very
1:48:15
different kind of approach.
1:48:18
The Indians were not included much there, either.
1:48:23
They weren’t in the pink tower, were they, at all?
1:48:25
I don’t think so.
1:48:26
If I remember answers from different people, if asked the question, “Were
1:48:31
tribal leaders involved?” I haven’t heard that they were - from anyone.
1:48:36
I don’t think they were.
1:48:39
Right about that time,
1:48:44
’91, I think it was ’91, the National Indian Forest Resource Management
1:48:49
Act was passed, a significant piece of legislation in several respects.
1:48:57
But Indian forestry and federal forestry were moving along
1:49:01
different tracks at that time.
1:49:05
And how did that change things?
1:49:10
Well, we’ve learned since then, I think, in the congressionally-mandated
1:49:15
studies of tribal forestry
1:49:21
is that, and in a way, you know, it’s hard to make generalizations
1:49:24
about all 200-300 tribes.
1:49:27
Because there’s such a vast
1:49:31
difference [land, politics, culture, economics]
1:49:32
. But, there is a thread of similarity, in that on the whole, they manage
1:49:36
their forests pretty well, both for environmental values and for timber.
1:49:41
And they manage in a different way.
1:49:43
They are kind of naturally within a tribe or a set of tribes within a reservation.
1:49:49
They tend to be more collaborative in their approach
1:49:52
to management than non-Indians.
1:49:55
Well, it’s because the decision-making processes are generally less hierarchical.
1:50:00
They’re more circular, more holistic.
1:50:03
There
1:50:05
is a buck-stopper that’s right there.
1:50:05
I mean, it goes to the tribal council, and then, they’re subject
1:50:09
to BIA approval, but BIA is mostly Indians, so it’s a much shorter,
1:50:21
“flatter” kind
1:50:23
of organization. But beyond that, this idea that gets overhyped
1:50:29
sometimes, that Indians see all things as related, but it’s true.
1:50:35
So when they have an interdisciplinary team, mostly we construe it as, “I speak
1:50:41
for the elk, I speak for the trees, I speak for the fish, and my job, if
1:50:46
I speak for anything but trees, is to get the number of trees cut down,
1:50:51
because that will make my part better, and the tree people think getting
1:50:54
more trees cut is going to be better.” So, it’s kind of this quasi-legal
1:51:04
adjudication. And where I’ve seen it work best in tribes, everything decides
1:51:08
what they want to come out the other end.
1:51:11
Yeah, we like fish, but we want money from timber, too, then everybody works
1:51:16
to see if that can be made to happen, which is quite a different approach.
1:51:22
In the Northwest, it would seem like they would be the ones most
1:51:26
interested in having both sides of the terrestrial and aquatic spectrum
1:51:30
of management respected equally, if you look at things historically.
1:51:34
And certainly, fishing is central.
1:51:36
And currently, if you look at
1:51:40
elk,
1:51:42
they almost always prioritize things other than timber, but they want that, too.
1:51:49
And so that’s—
1:51:51
What are the biggest tribes on timber here in the Northwest?
1:51:56
In Oregon--
1:51:56
In terms of resource base mainly?
1:51:58
Warm Springs.
1:51:59
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
1:52:00
Biggest in Oregon, and then there are the five Coastal tribes, four of
1:52:04
whom have moderate forest holdings, modest, I guess you would say.
1:52:10
And then in Washington, there are many, many tribes centered on fishing
1:52:15
around Puget Sound, and some of them manage significant amounts of timber.
1:52:20
But the biggest ones are the Yakima and the Colville on the east side.
1:52:24
Yeah, right, they’re pretty big reservations, too.
1:52:26
A
1:52:33
fellow, Larry Blythe, was pointing out to me that Indians are not, that’s
1:52:37
a white person’s term, that we don’t see ourselves as X [Indians] , we see
1:52:42
ourselves as Cherokees or whatever.
1:52:45
[Tribes, clans, families, etc.]
1:52:45
Right.
1:52:46
He said, for example, we Cherokees are very enterprising people.
1:52:51
So, one story he had was that, I think it was Dennis Banks, the activist, the Sioux.
1:52:58
Right, the whole Wounded Knee [protests and incidents, early 1970s]
1:53:00
. And a Cherokee who was terrified, rode into the national park
1:53:03
there in North Carolina, and he had on a big Sioux headdress.
1:53:07
The guy said, well, that’s culturally inappropriate.
1:53:11
You never had headdresses and this, blah-blah.
1:53:14
And Blythe said, yeah, but he gets $10 a pop for those.
1:53:19
To me, that’s culturally appropriate.
1:53:21
And the other one was that when they were having big trouble was about
1:53:26
the tomahawk chop of Atlanta [Braves]
1:53:30
. Right, the Atlanta Braves, but also the Seminoles [Florida
1:53:31
State] . They’re still doing it.
1:53:32
[Practice continues today, includes Kansas City Chiefs fans]
1:53:33
Yeah, and he said, we had people out by the road selling
1:53:40
handmade tomahawks for $20 or so.
1:53:43
Go figure.
1:53:45
So,
1:53:48
you weren’t involved in the FEMAT process, but you were doing your thing at Yale.
1:53:53
Still, were you consulted on it?
1:53:57
Yeah, I talked with Jack [Ward Thomas] and Jerry [Franklin]
1:53:58
. Okay, tell me about your still being involved from a
1:54:02
distance as that was going on.
1:54:04
Was this after the pink tower, or actually during that when they
1:54:06
were in their “cram sessions”?
1:54:08
[12-16-hour work-days over 90 days.]
1:54:08
It was more after the pink tower when there were different kinds
1:54:12
of meetings on the outcome.
1:54:14
Right.
1:54:15
And some, well, I guess, everybody on the Gang of Four, was really unhappy
1:54:25
with the final outcome in that.
1:54:29
It included “Survey and Manage,” and it pretty well emasculated the
1:54:36
Adaptive Management Areas, and never did more than kind of give a
1:54:45
passing glance to the timber targets.
1:54:48
[Specific policy prescriptions and methods following FEMAT, prominently in the Record
1:54:48
of Decision/Standards and Guidelines, and Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact
1:54:48
Statement for Record of Decision; both]
1:54:48
. Now, with “survey and manage,” I understand the principle of the thing.
1:54:55
But it seems to me, just on first reaction, that it’s problematic.
1:55:00
It was not just problematic, it’s impossible.
1:55:04
Well, I’m trying to be diplomatic, and Jack Ward Thomas was very strong
1:55:10
in his opinion that he thought that was a mistake to have that in.
1:55:13
Oh, yeah, and so did Jerry.
1:55:16
Who added that?
1:55:17
How did that get added?
1:55:17
I don’t know.
1:55:18
See, I don’t know.
1:55:20
I’ve heard different stories, that’s why I’m asking.
1:55:21
I know what came out of the
1:55:27
pink tower.
1:55:28
The numbers escape me, but I think it was Option 9 [Alternative was
1:55:32
term used] that was chosen finally.
1:55:34
And I think it was about like Option 12 for—
1:55:38
I’m handing John a map of Alternative 9, or “Option” 9.
1:55:43
Yeah.
1:55:43
Basically, the zoning that it was.
1:55:47
You know,
1:55:58
wonderful you’ve got all that stuff.
1:56:00
[Maps/reports]
1:56:00
Well, it helps jog the memory sometimes, and gives us context as we talk.
1:56:05
I think Jerry’s comment was, “they stole my baby.” That he really was heavily
1:56:11
invested in “9” and when it ground through the management guidelines,
1:56:17
it really wasn’t that anymore.
1:56:20
So, it was Alternative 9, only on the map?
1:56:24
Yeah.
1:56:25
But not necessarily in how?
1:56:26
How it was implemented.
1:56:27
[Guidelines-not done by FEMAT team]
1:56:27
Not as to how it would actually be implemented or not implemented?
1:56:31
Yeah, right.
1:56:34
I’d like to find more out about Survey and Manage, because my first reaction
1:56:38
when I saw that was, okay, I see why biologists, or I’ve heard it was different
1:56:44
people, wanting to add that in because they wanted a matrix of species, the
1:56:49
ecology, the whole-ism of “the thing,” to be included, but in real time and real
1:56:53
space, especially at a time when agencies are already struggling to deal with
1:56:58
all of these laws and having to provide evidence to either refute or support
1:57:03
whatever. I thought, “How do you do that?”
1:57:08
Well, the point at which you do that in contradistinction to actually measuring
1:57:12
things and see how, what outcomes you had.
1:57:15
Right.
1:57:16
I mean, that’s all input measurement, which
1:57:22
is, I don’t want to say, mostly a waste of time and effort, but a lot of it is.
1:57:28
And what you really want to know is what happened because of what you did.
1:57:33
Exactly.
1:57:34
So, if you keep track of what you did, and then measure what happened,
1:57:38
you can’t help but learn things.
1:57:40
But when, until very recently, in talking with federal agency people,
1:57:46
land management people, they said, “Well, we’d monitor, but we don’t have
1:57:49
enough money.” Well, they don’t have enough money in part, because they
1:57:54
spend it on other things, not that.
1:57:57
In other words, they’re not harvesting enough timber to pay for things
1:58:02
that used to be paid for with that?
1:58:04
Is that what you are saying?
1:58:04
That’s the argument, but they’re still spending a lot of money, $5 billion
1:58:08
a year, that must go somewhere, but it clearly isn’t going much into
1:58:14
monitoring, at least so they tell me.
1:58:16
Now, I haven’t audited the figures or anything.
1:58:18
But I do know that one small tribe I work with, the Coquille,
1:58:25
down out of North Bend and
1:58:29
Coos Bay; they’re the only tribe in the country that’s mandated to manage
1:58:32
under the standards and guidelines of surrounding federal land, which until
1:58:36
recently was the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:58:38
So, they managed for ten years, fifteen, well, almost twenty,
1:58:44
under the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:58:46
They’ve met all their targets.
1:58:47
Which would mean the murrelet there, too, especially?
1:58:50
Oh yeah, murrelet, owl, fish,
1:58:55
water quality, but they know they’ve met their targets, because they monitor them.
1:59:01
They have data.
1:59:04
And they have way more people per acre on the land than the federal agencies.
1:59:10
Now, the federal agencies have way more people in offices somewhere else.
1:59:15
But they monitor what they do and so they know if and when they go
1:59:21
wrong, and they can change it.
1:59:24
My impression is that the federal agencies do a very poor job of that, because
1:59:30
they spend their money on other things.
1:59:32
I don’t know what all those are.
1:59:34
All of it’s on fire now, and that’s inevitable, I guess, the
1:59:38
way we do things, but anyhow.
1:59:40
Now, you mentioned Adaptive Management Areas.
1:59:43
I interviewed Tom Spies recently, and he said, “That’s one of my big ideas
1:59:48
that I brought into this process in the FEMAT process.” And he’s been very
1:59:53
disappointed that it hasn’t panned out.
1:59:57
I mean, there’s been a couple of minor mini-successes for periods of time, but
2:00:01
ultimately, they hadn’t really happened.
2:00:04
Yeah.
2:00:05
And why do you think that’s true?
2:00:07
Because to answer a lot of the questions bound to be asked based on what’s
2:00:14
happened under the forest plan, would require research that calls for the
2:00:18
harvest of trees, and there are a lot of people who don’t want any trees
2:00:23
harvested, at least on federal land.
2:00:25
They oppose it.
2:00:27
I think the other one is money.
2:00:28
I don’t think, I never knew if the appropriations were there for
2:00:33
the Adaptive Management Areas.
2:00:36
But the idea, we talked about in the Gang of Four days.
2:00:43
Okay, they want this injunction lifted, we could give our best estimate of what
2:00:48
will do that now and different ways to do it, but we don’t know for sure
2:00:52
because we haven’t tried any of it.
2:00:54
So, there’s bound to be mistakes.
2:00:57
What we want to do is have a mechanism that will learn what we ought to do.
2:01:04
But there was no learning mechanism other than the Adaptive Management Areas, which
2:01:08
weren’t allowed to work, in my view.
2:01:11
There was no other learning mechanism built into the Northwest
2:01:14
Forest Plan, other than periodic reviews, ten, twenty years.
2:01:19
They’re just coming out with their twenty-year publications now.
2:01:22
Yeah.
2:01:22
And
2:01:25
so, that didn’t work.
2:01:27
Now, why do you think they didn’t meet their timber projections,
2:01:30
I mean, even come close?
2:01:32
It’s what, one-fourth of what they had hoped, which is already
2:01:36
diminished from what the traditional harvests were by quite a bit?
2:01:40
Well, I think one of the big changes was to move the definition of old growth
2:01:45
to the approximate culmination of mean annual increment for Douglas-fir in
2:01:49
the Northwest, which is eighty years.
2:01:52
So, suddenly, anything over eighty years was true old growth, which is further
2:01:56
from the truth if you look at the data.
2:01:57
Which is not.
2:02:00
True old growth is really 200-plus years?
2:02:03
Correct?
2:02:03
Yeah, right.
2:02:04
What we started in that SAF study, is I think when we established that, and
2:02:11
then after Franklin and others got
2:02:19
more data,
2:02:22
just because it’s 200 years old, doesn’t mean it’s old growth.
2:02:26
If it doesn’t have the layered character, it doesn’t have the right
2:02:29
amount of dead wood, it doesn’t have flat-top trees, it just doesn’t have
2:02:37
the characteristics you’d associate with
2:02:41
it.
2:02:41
[Old-growth forests]
2:02:42
And wouldn’t you also consider that a certain, idealized-vision of old growth?
2:02:47
I understand the layered aspects, I understand that, but it seems like
2:02:51
that’s a kind of romantic primitivism applied to a scientific paradigm?
2:02:56
Well, I don’t know.
2:02:57
I think it’s scientific, and you can measure it, at least.
2:02:59
Well, yeah, but I’m just saying, can’t there be different kinds
2:03:02
of old-growth forests, and it’s not this “perfect thing”?
2:03:06
Well, that’s what gave rise to those romantic notions, was people saying, well,
2:03:13
what the hell do you mean, old growth?
2:03:14
What is it?
2:03:14
Tell me what it is?
2:03:16
Well, it’s got to be any tree that’s over eighty years old
2:03:20
somehow, which puzzles me.
2:03:22
But that had a lot to do with not meeting the timber targets, because they got sued
2:03:28
and they chose not to do NEPA compliance documents that would stand up in court.
2:03:35
That simple.
2:03:39
Regarding the role of environmentalism, how would you characterize the
2:03:46
evolution in general from its early days to now, especially referring
2:03:52
to the subject that is the central point of our interview here today?
2:03:56
Well, I think it’s evolved a lot, and evolved in very many positive ways.
2:04:04
You know, environmentalists, the label covers a multitude of kinds of people.
2:04:11
And no generalization will be perfect, but on the whole, I’d say
2:04:17
it’s moved from the environmentalism that is keeping things safe, and
2:04:23
just metering them out very slowly,
2:04:28
to more now, yes, we’re stuck here on a planet with lots of people in it and
2:04:35
lots of other things, and so we have to find ways that we can go forward
2:04:43
that are
2:04:47
sustainable in the sense that you can keep operating.
2:04:52
The definition of sustainability is not, to me, saving things and
2:04:57
metering them out very slowly.
2:05:01
It’s having the tools you need when you need to them to cope with an unknown
2:05:06
future, with a future that surprises you.
2:05:10
This means you have to have a whole array of things ready, and part of that
2:05:14
array is having areas that are so-called natural areas, that are reserved as well
2:05:19
as possible from humans messing around in.
2:05:22
But it’s also having a lot of other areas where things are tried and monitored
2:05:28
in a scientific way, so you know what tools you have as things change.
2:05:36
I think as climate change goes on, we’re already behind the curve
2:05:46
in that we could have been preparing for this for a long
2:05:48
time, at least twenty years.
2:05:51
So my first helping of it, actually, it was forty years.
2:05:56
My first helping on global warming was when I was in the
2:06:00
Forest Service in the ‘60s.
2:06:02
In Wisconsin?
2:06:03
Yeah, the Washington office asked us to prepare what would happen
2:06:09
under different climate change scenarios, including warming, for
2:06:13
what’s going to happen to the trees.
2:06:16
So, periodically after that until now, it’s kind of gotten
2:06:22
popularized by Al Gore and company.
2:06:26
But up until then, for the preceding twenty years, it was on people’s minds and
2:06:31
people were working on it, but we didn’t really set out to learn in an organized
2:06:38
way what we could do in the face of it.
2:06:41
But what do you foresee climate change having an impact on the Northwest?
2:06:45
Well, the smart people I know say that it will have less impact on
2:06:51
the west side in the Northwest, than almost anywhere else in the country.
2:06:54
Do you think that’s true?
2:06:56
I don’t know.
2:06:57
You don’t think the drying will create more catastrophic fire regimes?
2:07:03
Well, I think it already has.
2:07:04
Yeah.
2:07:04
But there were catastrophic fires, time out of line, here.
2:07:11
So,
2:07:25
we don’t have any huge conurbations it sounds to me, in places like
2:07:26
Coos Bay, but we don’t have any huge population concentrations on
2:07:28
the coast anywhere, and the coast rises pretty sharply out of the sea.
2:07:34
It’s not like Florida, so sea level rise, which is one of the biggest consequences
2:07:40
that we’re not dealing with, won’t hurt Oregon and Washington near as
2:07:45
much as California and the East Coast.
2:07:49
I think we’ll get more fires, but that’s compounded.
2:07:53
We’re letting our federally-owned forest get older and older, and the older they
2:08:01
get, the closer they are to burning up.
2:08:03
And right now, I guess it was last fire season, 2015,
2:08:10
that 23 out of 24 lightning strike fires started in
2:08:16
old-growth stands on federal land.
2:08:21
Were they more on the east side?
2:08:22
No, I’m talking only west side.
2:08:24
Only west side, okay, I got you.
2:08:27
But east side, wow, who knows?
2:08:33
How did you stay in touch on the FEMAT?
2:08:36
You consulted on that.
2:08:40
What do you remember about your input and what was your critique,
2:08:44
some of the main points, leading up to the actual final report,
2:08:51
the Record of Decision and all that?
2:08:53
[NWFP Implementation guidelines and final report]
2:08:54
. Other than a series of conversations with some of the participants,
2:09:00
I may have done some reviewing.
2:09:02
I probably did.
2:09:03
I honestly don’t remember.
2:09:04
And then as soon as it was promulgated, of course, there was a lot of talk
2:09:13
about it at meetings, and I went to those and spoke at some of them.
2:09:16
Then the ten-year review.
2:09:20
I was in on that to a small degree.
2:09:25
What do you remember about the ten-year review and your part in it?
2:09:29
And what was your critique, your assessment of it?
2:09:31
Well, what I was supposed to do was review the part on old growth.
2:09:35
Okay.
2:09:36
And I did.
2:09:38
I found it a very happy story except for the owl’s part in it.
2:09:45
But the actual acreage of old growth was increasing over that ten years,
2:09:49
which was one of the objectives.
2:09:51
Right.
2:09:52
And unfortunately, the owl population was declining at the same time.
2:09:58
That was because the barred owl was starting - ? [To
2:09:59
encroach on spotted owl habitat]
2:09:59
Well, they didn’t know that then.
2:10:01
But it was already starting by then?
2:10:04
Right?
2:10:04
I think so, yeah.
2:10:06
Nobody talked about it much then that I remember.
2:10:10
But I
2:10:14
thought at the ten-year review time, I thought that there were a lot of things
2:10:21
wrong with the Northwest Forest Plan, but there was a lot right, and it was a good
2:10:26
thing to have done, and I still think so.
2:10:29
And how would you break down the good and the bad of the Northwest
2:10:31
Forest Plan, in retrospect?
2:10:32
Well, the bad was the public dismay at not meeting the timber targets.
2:10:38
I mean, we’ll pay a price for that forever, because there
2:10:42
are a lot of people who just
2:10:45
threw the whole thing out and said, well, you don’t do what you say,
2:10:49
so why should we pay any attention?
2:10:53
So that was the biggest flaw.
2:10:56
And then we’ve talked about not doing the AMA’s.
2:11:00
We’ve talked about having “Rule B” rules in there like “Survey and Manage.”
2:11:07
But, on the whole,
2:11:11
I’d say forests and fish and wildlife are significantly better off than
2:11:16
they would have been without the plan.
2:11:19
Now, what kind of a model or method do you think that this whole process
2:11:25
provides planners, managers, scientists, scholars, in the United States?
2:11:32
I hope what it will provide is, first of all, a fairly positive
2:11:37
outcome of the zoning approach.
2:11:41
And secondly, it shows us that a zoning approach isn’t the best approach,
2:11:45
that we need a more integrated way to look at forests and manage them.
2:11:48
So, those are the two.
2:11:51
And now, I’ve been told that a lot of international people took note
2:11:57
of this process, too, and you’ve done a lot of international work.
2:12:02
How would you characterize how the rest of the world, developed or less developed
2:12:07
countries, took note of this process?
2:12:11
Well, I think it served to really highlight the idea that forests are more
2:12:15
than just wood production factories, and all over the world and people took that
2:12:21
to heart, which is pretty obviously true.
2:12:25
This [NWFP] publicized it.
2:12:29
I think
2:12:32
in other places like
2:12:35
Finland and New Zealand, two I would name, that took the zoning
2:12:40
approach to its logical conclusion.
2:12:42
They looked at their natural forests, and
2:12:48
New Zealand said, okay, we’ll just put those off limits and
2:12:54
we’ll rely on plantations.
2:12:56
Now, that wouldn’t please a lot of the environmental people other places, but
2:13:00
they seem to like it in New Zealand.
2:13:02
And Finland, they looked at their federal forest estate, which wasn’t nearly as
2:13:08
large in percentage terms as ours is in the West, but they said, okay, these
2:13:13
are the really ecologically significant parts, the old growth, if you will, or
2:13:18
unique assemblages of species and things.
2:13:22
And we’ll be turning those into national parks.
2:13:25
We’re going to sell the rest of it, we’re going to turn the rest of it
2:13:27
into private forest land, of which 60-70 percent of Finland was anyway.
2:13:36
And now they have a very strong forest practices act.
2:13:44
So, the only other place I can think of where it actually
2:13:48
worked in sort of that vein, was
2:13:55
in Tasmania and Australia, where they had old-growth eucalyptus and most of
2:14:02
it was in a park in the western part of the island, and a camper, a good
2:14:09
environmentalist, set his toilet paper on fire and burned up the whole thing.
2:14:13
So, suddenly, they had very little old-growth eucalyptus grandis, which
2:14:19
are the size of old-growth Douglas-fir.
2:14:21
And those eucalypts burn hot.
2:14:23
Yeah, that’s right.
2:14:25
And that’s the key, they have to burn to get eucalypt back, they have to
2:14:29
burn at just the right temperature.
2:14:31
But not a crown fire type temperature.
2:14:34
[Very hot, stand-replacing fires]
2:14:34
What happens is, it turns into what they call rain forest, which is a
2:14:37
fairly-low forest of evergreen stuff.
2:14:41
They wanted to know what to do about it, and a group of us suggested that
2:14:48
they set aside a third of what they had left, sell a third, and then use
2:14:53
a third to figure out how to get more.
2:14:57
So, I think it had a lot of effect internationally, I really do.
2:15:02
What do you think the future of forestry and this plan are, going forward,
2:15:07
if you had a crystal ball and were going to say, this is what may happen?
2:15:11
What would you say in twenty years?
2:15:15
Twenty years, I think, we’ll be doing much more active management on federal land.
2:15:21
It won’t necessarily be mostly for timber, but we’ll realize you can’t
2:15:27
run millions of people over it and have mother nature handle it.
2:15:30
So, particularly in terms of fuel hazard reduction and fire
2:15:36
management, even on the west side, and
2:15:41
finding solutions that both enhance wildlife, fish and allow a reasonable
2:15:48
rural economy of some kind based on timber, because right now we’re throwing
2:15:54
away rural Oregon and Washington.
2:15:57
Speaking to that point, and we spoke off the record about the incendiary politics
2:16:03
in the United States right now, I’m of the belief that it’s one of many reasons
2:16:08
behind the whole rural-urban dynamic, which has just been a stress point
2:16:11
for decades and decades and decades.
2:16:13
But also, this
2:16:17
more intensive, ecological, post-modern scientific management of resources,
2:16:24
has led to what I think a lot of people in rural America perceive as the
2:16:29
complete exclusion of their interests.
2:16:32
Well, there’s no doubt about that.
2:16:34
Even though I don’t think that’s necessarily the intention,
2:16:37
it seems to be the result.
2:16:39
And I wondered what you have to say about
2:16:45
how that gap should be addressed?
2:16:48
Well, it ought to be addressed.
2:16:49
One thing, it isn’t now.
2:16:50
The urban people make the rules, and the rural people are supposed to obey them.
2:16:54
And that’s what got you the American Revolution, among other things.
2:17:00
I think we’re seeing echoes of that now, where some think, “Okay, you don’t
2:17:06
want to listen to me, I’m gonna do something you’ll have to listen to.”
2:17:12
I think the smugness of us people who live in these places, in places like
2:17:18
Portland, just goes beyond all bounds.
2:17:23
That really hit me four or five years ago.
2:17:25
I was down at Coos Bay, actually, in Coquille, the town, not the tribe,
2:17:33
and in the county [Coos] facilities.
2:17:38
They couldn’t afford to heat any room that didn’t have people in it all day.
2:17:44
So, both the chamber where the county council met, and the men’s room, at least,
2:17:49
I wasn’t in the women’s room, had no heat.
2:17:54
Now, how long would that fly in Portland?
2:17:59
No rural protection they say.
2:18:02
If you get robbed, you’ll be lucky if you report it, and you get a letter.
2:18:06
Well, they’ve had to defund the sheriff departments in a couple
2:18:09
southern Oregon counties, I think, Josephine and Curry, one of those.
2:18:13
And there’s basically no law enforcement.
2:18:16
And the answer I hear around here is, well, why don’t they pay taxes
2:18:21
to support themselves like we do.
2:18:23
Yeah,
2:18:26
but to do that, you’ve got to have a job.
2:18:30
I
2:18:34
think it’s a real crisis and it’s a lot of what’s behind our political divide.
2:18:41
Yes, I tend to agree.
2:18:44
I’ve seen that from afar, and as I’ve researched in the Southwest and now here,
2:18:49
I see a disconnect between the people that say they have all the people’s interests
2:18:54
at heart, and the reality on the ground.
2:18:57
Certainly that is how it’s being perceived out there in red state America,
2:19:01
I don’t even like using the “blue-red” thing, because it creates a bifurcation
2:19:06
that doesn’t help find the solution.
2:19:08
Well, if you really look at maps carefully, there are blue counties in red
2:19:13
states, and red counties in blue states.
2:19:15
And you can guess about which ones they are.
2:19:18
Exactly.
2:19:19
So, I’m big on the breaking down the rural-urban divide.
2:19:23
If I knew how to do it, I’d be famous, but I think it ought to be done.
2:19:28
But in terms of timber and this situation, the Northwest Forest Plan is merely
2:19:32
part of it; there’s BLM lands, there’s private lands, there’s state lands.
2:19:36
What would be an ideal you would at least like to be considered that would
2:19:40
help bring back those economies, if indeed harvesting more timber in a
2:19:45
responsible way, would be part of that?
2:19:49
Well, I think it could be.
2:19:50
And I think, there’s a real, insidious thing going on as the
2:19:58
federal timber stream has dried up the last twenty years, and the mills
2:20:03
are going away from rural areas.
2:20:06
And it’s hard to bring them back.
2:20:08
It’s real hard to bring them back.
2:20:10
It’s hard to find the capital, it’s hard to find the people.
2:20:15
People move away, so I don’t know.
2:20:18
But I think,
2:20:22
for example, one thing the tribes have been pushing through the
2:20:26
Intertribal Timber Council, is this idea of anchor forests.
2:20:29
What is that?
2:20:30
Anchor forests.
2:20:31
Okay, I’m sorry.
2:20:33
I’m sorry, I’m losing my voice, so I’ll have to shut up here soon.
2:20:36
Yeah, we’re almost
2:20:40
done.
2:20:41
But they say, we have these big tribal forests, particularly on the east side,
2:20:45
but if we could band together with other landowners, including the feds, who
2:20:48
also have a lot of timber over there, we could guarantee timber supply to mills.
2:20:56
Now, this seems like an echo of the old sustained-yield unit idea, and it
2:21:01
is in a way, but in another way, it’s a private-based effort that I think
2:21:05
would have some chance of working.
2:21:09
I think there are a number of places where new mills could be sited, if you
2:21:16
would produce, say, half the timber.
2:21:20
Jack Ward Thomas used to say that we probably could cut half the growth
2:21:23
nationally on the national forests, and we don’t do anything like that.
2:21:27
But you’d also have to create, you’d have to have different
2:21:32
abilities of these mills to process different sizes of logs as well.
2:21:36
You bet.
2:21:36
Because you’re not going to bring back the large-scale old growth
2:21:40
[harvesting] , or even smaller scale old growth except in limited cases.
2:21:43
Right, over time.
2:21:44
But in the short run, that’s very true.
2:21:49
But you’re right, though.
2:21:50
Once you’ve destroyed the demography of an area and a mill shuts down,
2:21:53
and it’s just a dead building sitting there, it takes more than just money
2:22:00
and resources to start it up again.
2:22:03
I think it’s going to take something like the Marshall Plan and all its facets.
2:22:12
Basically, a Marshall Plan for rural America.
2:22:16
Yeah.
2:22:16
Interesting.
2:22:18
A Marshall Plan for, I don’t know how you describe that really,
2:22:24
but it’s an interesting concept.
2:22:26
Nobody remembers what the Marshall Plan was any more but—
2:22:29
I do.
2:22:29
That would be a story.
2:22:31
I used to ask my Yale classes, graduate students, mostly from, Andover, Harvard
2:22:40
and Yale, and I’d ask, when was World War
2:22:51
I?
2:22:51
They might say, 1950.
2:22:51
So, history isn’t
2:22:54
in the front of everybody’s mind.
2:22:55
But the Marshall Plan did work and it didn’t cost much compared to its effect.
2:22:58
I think you could do the same thing in rural Oregon or rural anywhere.
2:23:05
You talk about infrastructure improvement in the United States,
2:23:09
obviously, they’re talking more about roads and bridges, and the
2:23:13
electrical and internet infrastructure; they’re talking about that.
2:23:16
But this is also part.
2:23:19
I mean, it seems to me like a lot of these infrastructure things are merely
2:23:22
to strengthen the urban-center dynamic.
2:23:25
Sure.
2:23:26
Would you read it that way?
2:23:27
Well, the urban people make the rules, so they get the stuff.
2:23:32
That’s right.
2:23:34
Anyway, let me make sure we’re done here.
2:23:37
What do you think the most important thing about the Northwest
2:23:40
Forest Plan is legacy-wise?
2:23:45
I think the fact that it was a regional
2:23:51
forest plan that got implemented and worked probably better than
2:23:55
most people expected it to.
2:24:00
I do want to ask one more addendum question here.
2:24:02
I forgot to ask you about two other important people.
2:24:06
Jim Sedell, first of all, and somebody who we lost not that
2:24:10
long ago, who was a shooting star.
2:24:13
I didn’t meet Jim, knew of him, but he got sick just when I
2:24:16
was coming on to this position.
2:24:18
Tell me about Jim Sedell.
2:24:20
I want to make sure we get something for the record on Jim.
2:24:22
He was another extremely bright guy and very effective in working in groups.
2:24:30
He had a good sense of humor.
2:24:34
Just a pleasure to be around.
2:24:42
What about Gordie Reeves, the other half of the aquatic team?
2:24:46
Gordie is one my all-time favorite people.
2:24:49
He tells it like it is.
2:24:51
He’s not always very moderate in his expression, but he’s a dedicated aquatic
2:24:57
scientist, and knows his business.
2:25:00
And he is good at taking science toward policy.
2:25:05
Very good.
2:25:10
I don’t know when I have had more fun than the relatively few times I’ve
2:25:16
been able to be out with Gordie along streams and along watersheds and listen
2:25:27
to him.
2:25:27
What’s your favorite memory from your time at Yale?
2:25:31
This is kind of an aside, but I just thought I’d throw this in.
2:25:38
I guess it was the first graduation we had when I was there at the school, and
2:25:46
seeing
2:25:49
people I’d been with all year get their degrees.
2:25:52
And I made my own speech, and nobody threw any eggs.
2:25:57
And it was just a wonderful feeling to see those bright, young folks
2:26:07
going out to save the world.
2:26:10
Is that what you loved the most about academia, watching people evolve and
2:26:16
become newly-forming success stories?
2:26:21
Yeah, you know, you bet.
2:26:24
Very good.
2:26:26
I think that’s probably about enough for today.
2:26:29
I think we’ve both run out of energy and we’ve covered pretty much everything.
2:26:33
Well, I’m glad, and I thank you for coming.
2:26:35
I’m going to have to scramble out of here.
2:26:37
I very much enjoyed it.
2:26:39
Thank you very much, John.
