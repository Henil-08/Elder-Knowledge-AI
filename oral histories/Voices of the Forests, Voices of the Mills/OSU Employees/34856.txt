00:01
Hello, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State University
00:05
College of Forestry, also with the U.S. Forest Service.
00:09
We are here in Corvallis, Oregon, as part of a history project
00:15
which includes oral histories.
00:17
The project is focused on the H.J Andrews Experimental Forest, but we're
00:21
also interviewing people involved with the College of Forestry, forestry in
00:25
general, and land management issues.
00:28
This is the first interview in this series, and we are here today with
00:32
William K. Ferrell, long-time professor in the OSU College of Forestry,
00:37
and ecological forestry researcher.
00:41
He's now retired, living here in Corvallis.
00:43
We are also here with Frederick Swanson, Emeritus Scientist, retired from the
00:48
U.S. Forest Service and very active with the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:53
So, I want to say hello, Bill, and how are you today?
00:56
I'm doing pretty-well, thank you.
00:58
Okay.
00:59
Fred.
01:00
Fine.
01:00
All right.
01:01
So, we are going to talk on the record today about Bill's experiences, focused
01:08
mostly on his work with the OSU College of Forestry, and especially with a lot of the
01:14
people that he knew and had as students, and his work itself at the Andrews,
01:19
but we're also going to range around and talk about other issues as well.
01:24
Okay, so I will ask you, first of all, Bill, where were you born and raised, and
01:29
what was your childhood like, especially in relationship to the natural world?
01:34
Yeah, I was born in Ohio, Barberton, Ohio.
01:40
That name is, the Barber family, is the basis for the Barberton.
01:47
And I lived for the first couple years at least in Barberton.
01:53
I was raised there.
01:57
And Barberton, is that close to Akron?
01:59
Yes, it's essentially
02:03
a suburb of Akron, I guess, you'd say.
02:07
But it has its own
02:11
character, which is not the best, I would say.
02:17
Was it a kind of a rough industrial town?
02:21
Yeah, it was a rough industrial town, I would say.
02:25
It had a few unique qualities.
02:28
It had a big pond in the middle of town, for example, and had
02:32
wonderful sounds from the railroads, at least that's my take on it.
02:39
The sound of a steam whistle on a railroad car engine is
02:45
something I just always remember.
02:49
Now, what experiences do you remember about your interactions with the natural
02:56
world, any specific places or events or things that impacted you when you were
03:03
young, that may have led you into the direction that you went to professionally
03:08
and personally later in life, where you were involved with studying and
03:12
teaching about nature and forestry?
03:15
Well, it wasn't studying and teaching, to follow up on what we were saying
03:20
previously, but where I was born.
03:24
It was my grandfather and my grandmother's farm, a small farm, but it was half-farm
03:35
land, half-forest, and a hardwood forest.
03:41
And it had some very interesting things in it in the way of
03:46
animals and various other things.
03:49
And I always looked forward to going there on weekends, and spend a couple days with
03:55
my grandmother and grandfather in the forest that was surrounding the place.
04:03
How would you describe the Akron area, both the city, and the forests and
04:10
the farmland, surrounding that area?
04:13
It was a heavily committed industry town, I would say.
04:21
For that reason, it had a lot of smoke and whatever in the air most of the time.
04:30
So, it wasn't very pleasant.
04:32
If you got outside of town that dwindled off
04:35
to a small amount of smoke.
04:38
I used to go hiking with some friends that belonged to a Boy Scout troop and
04:48
we had a small place out in the country that was ours to do what we would.
04:54
And we would go on weekends, every once in a while, we would take off,
04:57
perhaps a half dozen or more of us, and walk out to the Boy Scout
05:03
reservation and walk back the same day.
05:08
Now, I read something about how you used to go on these adventures to the rich part
05:14
of Akron where they had these big estates.
05:16
Is that true?
05:17
Yes, in the spring.
05:21
I can't remember the name of it, the company.
05:25
But the owners of the company, and in the spring at the time of bird migration,
05:33
it was a lot of fun to go to that place, because they were very careful not to
05:39
destroy the forests on their property.
05:45
We would see how many birds we could identify, and it was typically 25 or 30.
05:53
It was, the migration, far in excess of what would be
06:00
there for the whole summer.
06:02
But it was very, exceptionally pretty, as well as having a lot of bright birds.
06:08
Do you remember any of the species from those days?
06:11
Oh, yeah.
06:13
There were several thrushes,
06:17
and they weren't sensational for their color, but they were for their
06:26
voices, for lack of any better term to put on
06:34
it.
06:34
There was a lot of singing going on when those birds arrived in the spring.
06:38
Now, how do you think that
06:44
growing up in an area with such heavy industrial pollution and environmental
06:53
costs as we call them today, impacted how you looked at the natural world,
07:00
humankind's potential impacts on the natural world, and coming out West and
07:06
everything that you did after you finished your doctorate, I believe at Duke, and
07:10
then to Idaho and some other places.
07:14
But how do you think that initial experience affected
07:17
everything that came after that?
07:19
Well, it certainly opened your eyes to possibilities because for
07:28
the most part, there's no heavy industrial effect here in the West.
07:33
Some places, obviously, close to paper mills, for example.
07:37
But
07:40
it was true also in Ohio, but for the first week or so of the bird
07:47
migration, why, it didn't seem to affect the population very much.
07:56
Now, was there any
08:00
other particular experience or event, positive or negative, other than just
08:06
those long jaunts across Akron, something that maybe was scary or shocking or
08:13
especially beautiful or exciting, like a specific event that you remember?
08:19
Yeah, and it was
08:24
close to my grandfather's farm.
08:28
There was a lot of coal extraction going on.
08:32
And it was the type where they
08:36
didn't do it underground; it was all scrape off the overhead, top, the
08:47
layers of the forest and layers of
08:53
-- What
08:57
they call mountain-top mining, where they just scrape the whole thing dry?
09:01
Yeah, they scraped it off, some of it.
09:03
So, it was a mixture, but it was sad to see after it was done on
09:09
the ones where they scraped it off.
09:11
They didn't give a damn how they left it.
09:13
The
09:16
least cost was their objective.
09:19
What usually happened to those, the tailings piles, the holes, from the last
09:26
time you remember seeing some of those?
09:28
What do you remember their disposition being?
09:33
One of the worst aspects of it was the drainage from those scraped fields.
09:41
The runoff was highly acidic.
09:45
And it drained into the nearest stream.
09:47
And it
09:50
just killed off the life in that stream.
09:53
All you would see would be deposits of sulphur that were left over.
09:59
It was really sad to see it.
10:02
Now, was there a series of streams or a stream or a river system close
10:06
to Akron that would have been the downstream recipient of all these toxins?
10:12
The drainage actually was south from around Akron.
10:17
So, the Ohio River, a large stream, received the major part of the
10:23
runoff, and it was not pretty.
10:28
Quite a large difference between the pre-environmental age, before
10:33
the '60s and '70s when a lot of protection laws were passed, and the
10:38
era before when you saw people just did what they did, and walked away.
10:43
Right?
10:43
Yeah.
10:44
Quite a shock, right, when you think back through all that history?
10:47
Yeah.
10:53
Now, how do you think the location of those formative years with some
10:56
of these experiences, affected your views on science, ecology,
11:03
and a career in forestry, and in teaching it, specifically?
11:07
And how do you think that
11:10
impacted how you taught these subjects and evolved as a professional?
11:17
Yeah, they certainly had an influence.
11:20
You know,
11:23
the West has not been mangled so much in its environment
11:28
as the East of the U.S. And
11:35
in the case of the West, it was something that you were trying to stop
11:38
before it got started, because it's hard to reverse some of these things,
11:45
especially drainage from sulphur deposits.
11:50
They stay around for quite a while.
11:54
I recall one of my experiences that surprised me because I grew
11:58
up in the post-environmental age, when I went to Colorado.
12:04
Many parts of Colorado are well-preserved, but there's certain
12:07
areas in Colorado, specifically the Central Sawatch, but the San Juans
12:12
especially, where incredible damage has been done from unrestricted mining and
12:17
tailings, just left to basically drain downstream into all sorts of areas.
12:24
And so, there are places in the West where that was equally bad.
12:28
But, yeah, it's interesting to see the contrast, though.
12:32
Yeah.
12:34
Now, when entering the university system, did you know what you wanted
12:38
to study, and this would have been at Michigan first, and then of course,
12:42
you eventually ended up at Duke.
12:44
But how did that progress evolve in terms of what you wanted
12:48
to be and eventually became?
12:51
Well, I didn't have visions of being a forester, necessarily, I just wanted to
12:56
get involved in outdoor examination of the topography, the plants and animals that
13:04
were there, and how we were affecting it.
13:07
This all fit together.
13:09
And it was the way that I looked at it when I was a freshman.
13:15
Do you remember what you took at Michigan when you first went there?
13:20
I was in the forestry, they may have called it, the pre-forestry program.
13:25
And I don't remember distinctly any forestry courses, per
13:30
se, in the first year.
13:32
But
13:35
we had some introduction to it by some of the old-time members of the faculty.
13:44
It was a mixed bag at Michigan.
13:46
They had some outstanding professors, and they had some,
13:50
who frankly, were out-of-date.
13:54
They were trying to tell us about what happened when they were young bucks,
13:58
and that was fifty years before.
14:03
Do you remember a professor named Samuel Trask Dana?
14:07
Oh, yes.
14:08
He was there when you were there, right?
14:10
Yes, he was the dean.
14:11
Yes, did you ever take a class with him?
14:14
No, I didn't.
14:16
I think he did offer one senior course, but I never took anything from him,
14:20
although I interviewed him several times.
14:23
Oh, you did?
14:24
Yeah.
14:24
Tell me about that?
14:26
Well, I was concerned about some of the things that were going on in the
14:31
forests around the university and so on.
14:35
And so, I went to talk to him about it.
14:38
And he was receptive, at least facially, he was receptive.
14:47
You
14:49
were a whippersnapper undergraduate?
14:51
[Laughs]
14:53
Yeah, Sam Dana was well-known all over the country, really.
14:58
And so, he had a reputation to hang onto.
15:03
Now, are you aware of H.J. Andrews and the fact he went to
15:09
Michigan, and even taught there?
15:12
Yeah.
15:12
I never was introduced to him, either personally, or as a group.
15:19
I never
15:20
- I don't think he was there when you were there.
15:23
But he did go to school there, and he actually taught once or
15:27
twice, in short tenures there.
15:29
And he was friends with Dana.
15:31
Yeah.
15:34
Now, when you came out of Michigan, your degree, was it in forestry?
15:41
When I came out?
15:41
Was your degree in forestry after you graduated from Michigan?
15:44
Yes.
15:45
And how did that transition to graduate school and eventually going to Duke?
15:51
There was a war in-between somewhere, I believe, right?
15:53
Yeah.
15:57
When I came back, the first thing I did when mobile was to go up
16:06
to Michigan.
16:07
I'd had my eye on going back to school and taking a full course of forestry.
16:19
They were polite, like Sam Dana even had a few words to say to me.
16:27
It was the beginning of being serious about the matter.
16:35
Now, I've already got a lot on the record about your war years, and I don't want to
16:39
spend too much time there, but you spent your whole time over in Southeast Asia?
16:45
Yeah.
16:46
And obviously, very different than anything in the continental United
16:51
States, especially, the Northwest.
16:53
How did that experience, mainly focusing on the natural world, but
16:58
also what you saw in the human dynamic, considering you spent a lot of time
17:02
in Calcutta, how did that affect you coming back in terms of the man,
17:08
nature, natural resource triangle?
17:10
Also, how did that experience affect how you saw those things
17:14
as you developed intellectually, became a Ph.D. and a professor?
17:20
It was really a very important part of my development, I would say, having gone
17:28
through the forests of Southeast Asia.
17:31
And I had an experience or two with some wildlife that taught
17:39
me how to stay away from things that you didn't really understand.
17:45
The things I didn't understand were the poisonous snakes in India.
17:51
There was one in particular, the Krait, which is a small snake, very toxic,
17:57
and tree-born, for the most part.
18:01
It jumps off the tree onto somebody, if you're close enough.
18:06
One came fairly close to me, but I didn't get him, or he didn't get me.
18:11
Did you ever know anybody that was killed by any of these
18:13
poisonous snakes over there?
18:15
No, but it was famous, because Cleopatra was killed by a Krait.
18:20
Really?
18:20
So yeah.
18:24
I was quicker than Cleopatra, I guess.
18:27
Very good.
18:29
But you, and even quicker than Marc Antony, right?
18:38
[Laughs]
18:42
Who would you say your most important mentor was during your schooling,
18:47
either at Michigan or Duke, or both?
18:51
Well,
18:53
I guess at Michigan, it would probably
19:00
be somebody, not on the forestry staff, but in the botany department.
19:09
There was a sort of a tough-old bird at Michigan.
19:16
I managed to do well in his course, but he was never one to give a grade, a
19:21
high grade, unless he absolutely had to.
19:29
At Duke it was Ted Coyle, Theodore Coyle, a soils man.
19:35
He was,
19:38
and a plant physiologist by the name of Paul Kramer, who was not in forestry,
19:44
but offered something that's relevant.
19:52
Coyle, unfortunately, ran into trouble, personal trouble, and ultimately died,
20:01
as a result of not being able to control
20:06
that problem he had.
20:07
But he was the soils
20:10
professor at Duke.
20:13
What was your emphasis if you recall, what can you remember
20:16
about your program of study?
20:18
I'll really take you back.
20:20
And your dissertation, how did that kind of……What do you remember about that?
20:26
Well, I remember the botany department.
20:33
Several of the people in it were very close to the forestry faculty and offered
20:39
courses that most forestry students took.
20:42
They weren't required, but they were courses that they took.
20:49
There was some sadness in some of it.
20:52
Coyle, who was my major professor, became an alcoholic, and
20:58
ultimately succumbed to that.
21:02
That's always sad when you see a role model fall victim
21:07
to the vices, shall we say.
21:11
Self-destruction, really.
21:13
What about Professor Kramer?
21:15
I know that you've spoken about him a lot in the past.
21:19
Tell me a little about him.
21:21
Yeah, Kramer was very helpful.
21:23
As a matter of fact, after I left Duke, I came out to the University
21:30
of Idaho and took a position there.
21:36
And Kramer was always one to call me and say, "Bill, I have an offer here
21:42
from such-and-such a university for an opening in, well, something to
21:48
do with plant physiology." He said, "Would you like a recommendation?" And
21:55
I think in one case, I did say yes, but in general.
21:58
Is that how you ended up at Idaho [University of] as your first job?
22:03
Yeah.
22:04
Now, just real quick, going back to Duke, being kind of an elite private
22:09
school in the South, and of course, most your career you're at a public
22:13
university in the Northwest, how would you describe the culture, not just in
22:19
general, but also the academic culture of a private school in contrast with
22:24
a public school like Oregon State, a traditional land grant university?
22:31
A private school, Duke at least, has
22:37
a lot of money behind them.
22:41
They could do lots of things for you.
22:45
For example, Oregon State would have a hard time handling, or
22:49
Idaho, for example, even more so.
22:54
So, I enjoyed Duke
22:59
because it was quite cosmopolitan, and I had a lot of things going
23:05
on that only a private university probably could afford to have.
23:11
What was your dissertation, Bill?
23:15
Sorry,
23:18
you don't have to cite the whole title because those are long, weird titles,
23:21
but do you remember what the subject was?
23:24
Yeah, it was about competition
23:31
for survival and growth in about a half dozen species of trees.
23:40
And so,
23:43
it was counting, first of all, survival, and secondly, growth.
23:49
And so, my master's thesis was on that.
23:54
Was that based in maybe a more deciduous forest in the Appalachian area?
24:00
Yeah.
24:02
Now, how would you describe the dynamic between that forest, that
24:06
ecosystem, and what you saw out here?
24:09
How would you contrast Appalachia with Cascadia, shall we say?
24:17
Well, of course, the seasonal variation is less back there than it is here.
24:27
And that has quite an impact on survival,
24:35
I would say, by a factor of two, perhaps.
24:43
It was an easier proposition at Duke than it is out here because
24:50
we didn’t have that much variation.
25:04
Now, how would you describe some of the core theories that
25:09
you were taught in school?
25:12
Which theories?
25:13
Core theories about the main disciplines, things that you would remember that
25:18
were paradigms of the time, that made an impact on you, and that maybe you
25:25
embraced, or even later on, modified or rejected, whether it be forestry,
25:31
soils, anything that you remember?
25:34
Well,
25:37
there were problems in the forests there.
25:40
They were more diverse than the forests here, so you were less able to
25:48
predict what was going to come about in forests back in North Carolina,
25:56
than you are out here in the West.
25:59
There are simply more species there, and consequently, they're representative of a
26:04
broader range of climate and other things.
26:15
Now, do you remember any especially profound event during your university
26:20
life, rather than just a teacher, but something that happened?
26:24
Maybe you were on an exchange program, on a field trip, an undergraduate
26:29
project, a graduate project, a particular thing that really made an impact on
26:38
you?
26:38
In my personal life, it did.
26:40
Yeah?
26:41
Oh, how was that?
26:42
Well, my wife, Louise, the mother of my children,
26:52
was a student there, as well as I.
26:55
Well, that's important.
26:56
Yeah, it was.
26:57
At Michigan, or Duke?
26:59
At Duke.
27:00
Okay.
27:03
So, how did you meet your wife, if you don't mind me asking?
27:07
Let's see.
27:08
I guess
27:13
I spotted another girl who was attractive, and I had asked her out
27:21
for a date, and she said, "Well, Bill, I'm already engaged to another man.
27:26
I am sorry, I can't." But she told Louise, her sister in the sorority,
27:38
and so I ended up marrying Louise.
27:45
It's funny how things work out, huh?
27:48
Were you in a fraternity?
27:50
No.
27:51
Okay.
27:52
You don't seem like a frat guy, Bill.
27:57
Now, what thought or term, or what thought or image did the term "forestry"
28:02
illicit when you first heard it, and how did that dynamic evolve as you came
28:07
to understand the forestry paradigms and ideals you were taught, like
28:12
as an undergraduate and a graduate?
28:14
Then, how did you look at forestry as not only as your own career
28:18
evolved, but society evolved?
28:22
It's you feel that you have some personal responsibility, I think.
28:28
As a result of that personal responsibility, you have a
28:33
requirement to be consistent to see that other people understand it
28:37
better than they have in the past.
28:40
And so, I didn't stop people on the street and say, "Hey, have you heard about it?"
28:46
The new thing in forestry?
28:48
Yeah, but I did have a few friends who didn't, who were relatively
28:53
ignorant, so I could work on them.
28:55
Okay.
28:58
Now, how would you characterize your environmental ethic at the early stage
29:05
in your career as a graduate student, but once you became a professor, how would
29:10
you view how you looked at the natural world, and the human/nature relationship,
29:17
and how did that evolve for you?
29:21
You learned enough about the requirements of the forest in order
29:28
to have a forest that's producing what you'd like; production, productivity,
29:37
protection of the soil, whatever.
29:41
And so, you feel that responsibility to try to make those things
29:46
understood, and technology, by people and the general society.
29:56
Now, when you came out here, it was shortly after World War II, in Idaho,
30:01
and then in the 1950's, in Oregon.
30:04
How would you describe forestry on the public lands especially, but
30:08
private lands as well, as practiced?
30:12
I mean, it was often called the “Age of the Clear-Cut,” industrial
30:15
forestry was rising up, but how did you see that through your young eyes?
30:22
And how did that impact how you taught and did research?
30:28
I always have pointed that out when we were out in the field.
30:33
It's far more effective if you're looking at something and
30:38
can introduce it in discussion.
30:40
And what relevance does it have to something we've been talking about,
30:45
say, in class, pretty recently.
30:46
So,
30:49
that's to me, the thing I found useful, to get the people interested
30:55
in something that has a lot of impact.
31:05
Now, focused on teaching, not in general, theoretically, but also your
31:10
own experience and career, what was your understanding about the role of
31:16
the professor, instructor, mentor, when entering the academy, and how did that
31:22
change over the course of your career?
31:30
It didn't change very much, I would say.
31:35
At an early stage, I was just getting acquainted with the forest
31:41
here, and it was important to
31:47
do that because I'm trying to be relevant to the things that they have to deal with.
31:53
And so,
31:56
it became fun to start pointing out things that were new to the people there.
32:05
And that was a nice thing to realize and carry out.
32:15
What do you remember about the student, the typical student?
32:20
I don't know if you can say that, but the general demographic, attitude and culture
32:25
of the students that came in, in the '50s, versus the '60s and '70s and beyond?
32:32
What do you remember about what were they looking for in forestry or land
32:36
management, versus what came later as culture and society changed very much?
32:45
I would say that I am
32:53
wondering if I can say something that's not exaggerated.
33:00
It's all too easy to pick something up and say that that's one of the things but
33:07
it may not be.
33:10
In other words, don't pound your chest if you haven't got something to explain it.
33:14
So,
33:20
I don't know.
33:21
It's a little bit harder to
33:26
deal with that.
33:27
My point is; do you remember that the student of the '50s, for instance, and
33:34
then, the student of the '70s, as hair got longer, people were experimenting more?
33:44
I mean, how did that affect, for instance, what kind of
33:49
career they wanted in forestry?
33:51
Do you remember their attitudes and questions changing?
33:56
Yeah, some.
33:57
Some of it was perhaps not as well-advised as might have been.
34:06
But I remember relatively soon after I arrived here, I'd take
34:12
students on an overnight trip.
34:17
In one of the towns on the range, over on the Coast, we stopped for
34:25
something or another, and the kids wanted to get sandwiches and what-not.
34:31
And I said, "Okay, but don't come back here late." I gave them twenty
34:38
minutes or something like that, and which was plenty of time to get what
34:42
they needed, but or what they wanted.
34:44
And [phone
34:49
ringing]
35:00
the time came
35:01
-- [Break in audio]
35:01
The time came when I told them they should be back at the bus, and anyone that wasn't
35:06
there, was going to get left there, and they could make their own way back home.
35:12
They didn't worry about that, huh?
35:15
No, they didn't worry about that.
35:16
But they did worry about it when it turned out I wasn't just
35:21
-- You weren't kidding?
35:22
I wasn't faking, no.
35:24
So,
35:27
they never again did that.
35:30
Oh.
35:30
You left them there?
35:31
I left them there.
35:33
[Laughs]
35:33
Where was that, do you remember?
35:35
Oh, halfway over to the Coast, in some little burg.
35:37
Really?
35:40
Well, you guys are going great, and I need to go pick up a kid from high school.
35:46
Okay, we're continuing.
35:47
Once that happens to some kids, they understand
35:54
that you mean it when they say, you tell them to get back there at a certain time.
35:57
And it's a little rough, but I think it's probably a good lesson.
36:03
Describe the OSU
36:11
College of Forestry when you arrived, and how did it evolve over the more
36:18
than thirty years that you were there?
36:22
And describe the evolution in any way that you see fit; curriculum, faculty
36:29
composition, and even facilities?
36:32
Well,
36:34
the attitude was
36:38
pretty well-established by the dean at the time.
36:45
Oh, what
36:48
the heck was his name?
36:49
He was an old-time logger in some respects.
36:52
Well,
36:54
I've got, a history timeline of the OSU College of Forestry, but you you
36:55
know what, it might be in the car.
36:58
Let me put this on hold.
36:59
[Break in audio]
37:00
We're back on.
37:00
Yeah, McCulloch [Walter F.] was a pretty-tough, but fair-minded guy.
37:07
At least that's my assessment of him.
37:09
And it was good for the students to have
37:16
some of that type of leadership in their experience.
37:20
Somebody who was really, he was well-educated and well-spoken, but
37:27
he could really let blast if he felt like it or if he thought it needed it.
37:34
But Stoltenberg [Carl] , later, was a very different person.
37:40
How so?
37:42
He was more research-oriented on those things.
37:48
McCulloch wasn't opposed to it, but that wasn't his point, his strong point.
37:53
But isn't that true about most universities in this country, the
37:58
U.S., which over time became more research-oriented as the economy
38:05
in the post-World War II era became
38:08
stronger and more stable, providing the infrastructure for there to be teaching
38:14
schools, versus Research I universities.
38:17
Even OSU was more a teaching school at one time, and it became more of a research
38:23
school, the last three, four decades.
38:26
Correct?
38:27
Right.
38:27
Wouldn't you say so?
38:28
Well, yeah.
38:31
Yeah.
38:31
Now, you were known more for your excellence in teaching,
38:37
but you did research also.
38:40
Looking at your work as a researcher, describe how your career in research
38:44
evolved and how did your research experiences reflect back on your teaching?
38:51
Well, to go to the last point,
38:56
if you're going to do some things in research, you'd better be up-to-date.
39:03
Otherwise, you're an old-fogey.
39:05
And I did a pretty good job of staying up-to-date.
39:06
I subscribed to a couple journals and what not.
39:21
I enjoyed it,
39:24
because to me, anything that reveals more about the world we're living in the
39:30
better, the more you know about them.
39:33
And that's the point of research.
39:35
In other words, you can become educated through books in your education as
39:41
you develop, and then even as you're in your career, but the context
39:47
of "out there" found not just in books, enriches what you teach?
39:52
Yeah.
39:53
Is that what you're saying?
39:54
Yeah.
39:55
And cite some specific examples for you, personally, of things that you learned,
40:02
or research that you did, or experiences you had, that impacted you to where you
40:07
wanted to take it into the classroom and you said, "Wait a minute, I want to think
40:13
differently about that subject or that approach, or I want to emphasize that more
40:18
in my teaching of this class or that?"
40:23
Fortunately, I was well-suited for doing that because I was
40:34
interested in the science of botany and various aspects of botany, and
40:42
other physical objects as well.
40:47
So, in spreading that knowledge then to young people, who may
40:56
have heard about it but probably
41:00
hadn't, it got them in a mood of, well, there are
41:06
a whole lot of things about the world I may not know about, and I'd like
41:10
to know more about them, especially those that have some impact on me.
41:16
And so, it's an essential part of teaching, I think, to make the
41:23
students aware of new knowledge.
41:26
It's important.
41:29
And I did as much of that as I could.
41:31
What were your main core classes that you taught?
41:35
I mean, you probably taught quite a few subjects, but you probably had five or six
41:41
central subjects that were your “babies”?
41:44
Yeah.
41:44
And what were those?
41:48
The ones that had to do with botany and chemistry.
41:55
And I always introduced them, even though the course title might not have brought
42:07
different thoughts to their mind at first, they'd find out that the things
42:13
I taught, chemistry and physics and things of that sort, that I could
42:16
bring in and make known to them, they'd realize that the more they'd expand
42:23
their knowledge, the more they can produce in what they're trying to do.
42:30
And did you have a favorite class
42:35
or classes?
42:36
Yeah.
42:37
That were like your ones you just loved to teach, whether undergraduate or graduate?
42:42
Well, tree physiology was probably the one.
42:48
I don't remember how many students I had in the course, but it was very relevant.
42:53
The growth
42:57
and the survival under extreme weather conditions, and so forth, they're all
43:03
related to physiology of the plant, or
43:08
something similar to that.
43:11
And it would seem to me like that would be a really interesting subject based on your
43:16
East Coast-West Coast comparative context, where you had Appalachia deciduous
43:23
forests, and here, coniferous forests, where you saw two dramatically different,
43:29
still temperate zone, forest ecosystems, but you would learn the physiology
43:37
but also the morphology of the forest.
43:39
Correct?
43:40
Yeah.
43:41
Which is part of physiology.
43:43
Yeah.
43:45
Incidentally, University of Michigan, which is where I took
43:49
my undergraduate work, had a summer camp up in Upper Michigan.
43:56
Up above Mackinac?
43:57
Yeah.
43:59
And it was an eye-opener because
44:04
most of the forest, I would say, probably 75 percent of it is
44:11
conifer trees, one kind or another.
44:15
Perhaps not as many as were there once had because that's
44:18
the first thing they cut down.
44:20
But it was exactly it.
44:25
Did you learn or see the results, because you're not that far removed from the days
44:31
of the late 19th century, of the railroad logging in the upper northern U.S.?
44:39
They called it the Northwest back then, but Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan,
44:44
and they'd build the railroads into there, cut everything down, and leave.
44:50
Yeah.
44:51
I bet the forests that you saw, many of them in Michigan, were the
44:55
second and third growth, remnants of what grew after that era.
45:00
Would that be correct, or was there still some old-growth stuff up there?
45:04
There was a little bit of old growth.
45:06
Okay.
45:06
Yeah, it was mostly stuff that was probably fifty years old.
45:11
But I mean, there was no original forest left up there?
45:16
You could usually find a little patch here and there, but that's about all.
45:20
Right.
45:21
That would be up north, like up by Lake Superior then?
45:24
Yeah.
45:25
Okay, and tell me about this camp a little bit more?
45:29
Summer camp was an attempt to get practical things into the curriculum
45:36
because you had to mark trees for cutting, and then have that criticized
45:45
by the professor or his assistant.
45:48
And
45:51
various things like that had already been done and the question was to analyze now
45:58
that it's been done, what are the things to get the best growth in that forest.
46:07
And it was, you know, a challenge to imagine what's going to
46:13
happen in the future as a result of projecting something.
46:26
What were the facilities like at the College of Forestry in Oregon
46:31
State in general, when you arrived?
46:33
I believe Peavy Hall was being built or was just built when you arrived.
46:40
Correct?
46:41
Yeah.
46:42
What were their lab facilities, and in general, what did they have compared to
46:47
now when they've got this massive complex?
46:56
Gee, I have never really thought about that enough to make a good comparison.
47:03
Oh, that's okay.
47:04
But I just thought it might be a valid question.
47:06
Oh, sure.
47:09
We can come back to it if you remember something else later on.
47:15
What is your view on the relationship between the professor and his students,
47:19
the ideal pedagogical relationship?
47:23
How do you view that dynamic?
47:27
I should always be available to answer questions.
47:31
And to get the students in a discussion of, here is the answer that's
47:38
usually given, but can you think of something better, for example,
47:45
would be a good example of getting them to think about the things that are out there.
47:51
Now, you grew up in the era when most professors just lectured.
47:59
Something tells me that you modified that or that you mixed lecture with other
48:06
interactive classroom or field exercises.
48:11
Is that correct?
48:13
Yeah.
48:13
I particularly tried to do that on field exercises.
48:19
I don't know if they still have much time spent on it, but I would take,
48:25
for the silviculture course, or silviculture and ecology, a trip or
48:34
two per term; one to the coast, one to the east side of the mountains
48:41
[Cascades] . We had fun, you know.
48:45
If there was a good brewery around, we might stop and have a nip or two.
48:51
Even with your students.
48:52
Huh?
48:53
Uh-huh.
48:53
As long as they were over 21?
48:56
Yeah.
48:56
I won't tell, you're retired, Bill.
48:59
[Laughs]
49:01
But it was more a journey to learn things than anything else.
49:10
Do you remember some of the memorable field trips that you
49:13
took around Oregon or wherever?
49:15
Yeah.
49:18
Other than the one where you left students there to teach them a lesson.
49:21
The
49:24
word for that got around.
49:28
It persisted.
49:29
Don't mess with Ferrell.
49:30
[Laughter] Be on time.
49:38
Yeah.
49:41
I didn't go into a beer joint with the guys.
49:43
And I didn't say anything to them about going into it, but
49:49
I told them not to get drunk.
49:52
They pretty well followed that.
49:56
You never want to get too out of control in front of the guy
49:58
that's writing your grades.
50:00
[Laughs]
50:03
But any specific field trips or places that you went?
50:10
One, since people lived pretty-well off the vegetation around here, I had one trip
50:18
over to the Coast, the coastal forest, and the other one was over on the other
50:23
side of the mountains, on the east side.
50:27
In both cases, they were
50:32
good and we had fun.
50:33
And it was as much as that as anything, I thought it was a good chance to get
50:41
acquainted with each other and warmed up.
50:44
Now, did you ever take your students up to the Andrews?
50:49
In later years,
50:52
when results of experiments started to become evident.
50:56
After it was just a regular experimental forest and it started to become
51:02
a true ecological research site?
51:05
Is that when?
51:06
[s and afterwards.]
51:06
Yeah.
51:07
Okay.
51:10
Now, you are held in high regard by your former students.
51:14
What are some of your best memories of interactions, especially with what you
51:19
might call, your "shining star" students.
51:22
And of course, I'm thinking about Jerry Franklin, but other people, who you
51:26
want to mention about some of the people that really emerged from your tutelage,
51:32
and in general, from the OSU College of Forestry who went on to do great things?
51:38
And obviously, it is an inspiration to any teacher, like a parent that has a child
51:44
that goes out and conquers the world.
51:46
I mean, you're proud?
51:47
Tell me about that.
51:49
Well, I learn about some cases.
51:54
It's not easy to find out what the person did if you don't have somebody
51:59
to provide you with some information.
52:03
And not all the information is available.
52:05
But
52:08
often, if they feel that they're doing well, they'll come back to see
52:12
me and tell me about how happy they are, what they're doing and so on.
52:18
And so, a lot of it is just that way.
52:25
It's hard to put a finger on any others.
52:30
Tell me about some of your student that really went on and did things.
52:34
I mentioned Jerry's name.
52:37
You want to talk about Jerry?
52:39
Yeah, Jerry's
52:40
-- He's talking about Jerry Franklin, by the way, for the record.
52:43
Pardon?
52:44
Jerry Forest Franklin.
52:45
You knew that was his middle name, didn't you?
52:47
No, I didn't.
52:48
His middle name initial, F, is for Forest.
52:50
You didn't know that?
52:51
No.
52:52
It is, anyway.
52:56
Jerry and I kept in touch as personal friends, as well as colleagues.
53:03
And
53:08
we have some of the same, I don't whether I should say, “weaknesses,”
53:12
but things that we're interested in.
53:16
We're both interested in miniature railroads.
53:20
Oh, really?
53:20
Yeah, toy railroads, you know.
53:24
HO scale, the little kind?
53:25
Yeah.
53:26
Okay.
53:29
He and I don't know
53:34
whether you've met.
53:35
Oh, what,
53:39
the heck?
53:39
I'm embarrassed, one of my students, who's got a Ph.D. and has a toy railroad.
53:51
Oh, really?
53:53
Yeah.
53:54
I had one when I was small, too.
53:56
I never became an enthusiast, but I see the attraction.
54:00
Yeah, well, he is.
54:03
He was on the faculty, too.
54:05
Here?
54:06
At Oregon State, yeah.
54:08
Not Mark Harmon?
54:09
No, no.
54:11
I know you know him, that's why I brought up the name.
54:17
But tell me more about Jerry and watching his career unfold, from, obviously,
54:24
a successful Forest Service scientist
54:28
who got his doctorate during that whole career.
54:32
Then he went on to really-high profile research and academics, but also
54:38
politics, because of his role in New Forestry, for instance, and old growth.
54:45
You know, whatever
54:50
he chose to do, I would encourage him because he had the ability
54:56
to carry it out, whatever it was.
54:59
Whether it was going to work or not is another thing, but you
55:02
can't find out unless you try it.
55:05
At least there are some things you can obviously write-off, but others,
55:12
you don't know until it's been tried.
55:14
What do you think about his cone studies?
55:17
[Cone crop/seed monitoring.]
55:18
Cone studies?
55:19
Where he studies cones, and he does cone [and seeds] counts.
55:22
And he still has sites all over the Northwest.
55:25
Did you know that?
55:27
I guess I've heard about it, but I never thought about it more.
55:30
Yeah, he has an engine that never stops.
55:34
That's my impression of him just from reading his research record, which
55:38
I'm doing a lot of work with now.
55:41
Yeah, he's always finding something to do.
55:46
The other thing you both have in common is you're both senior citizens.
55:49
[Laughter] I had to throw that in for a joke on the record.
55:53
Sorry.
55:54
Oh,
55:57
sure.
55:57
Now,
56:00
how have your views about the ethical responsibilities of the scientist
56:07
or professor changed since you came into a professional career?
56:13
And even today, reflecting twenty years or so after you retired, how do
56:18
you view the ethical responsibilities of the scientist, the researcher, and
56:23
the instructor, in terms of teaching people how to take care of the planet?
56:30
The
56:32
citizen, you know, besides the things that you mentioned.
56:37
I think, that I don't know that one is more important than
56:44
others, but they all need to be
56:52
accommodated, I guess you'd say, in some way, in your work.
57:00
Now we're going to go to the Andrews.
57:06
When did you first hear about the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and at that
57:11
time, what did you know about experimental forests and long-term research?
57:20
Well, I knew a reasonable amount about long-term research.
57:25
And just an obvious need, among other things.
57:29
Some of it more critical than others, but it's just part of curiosity,
57:37
I think, is always a practicality.
57:43
So,
57:48
there's a funny
57:54
incident that happened after I was no longer with the
57:59
university, but it came up.
58:04
It was with a woman, a graduate student, who was a rather odd
58:15
person.
58:19
She came to me because there wasn't anybody else at the moment,
58:25
I guess, that had time for her.
58:28
But she had some research that she wanted to elaborate on and
58:39
get her degree, a Ph.D. She had a master's degree.
58:45
I don't know whether it was in forestry or not.
58:47
But at any rate, she was an odd person.
58:55
I felt sorry for her because she obviously was bright, and she had accomplished some
59:04
things that were a little hard to believe.
59:08
For example, she ran for mayor of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
59:15
What was her political persuasion?
59:18
She was liberal.
59:19
I think she was a Democrat.
59:21
But
59:25
of all things, she had
59:35
gotten, what I can I call it?
59:38
Support.
59:39
Fellowship or grant?
59:44
No.
59:44
Political support.
59:45
Oh, okay.
59:46
In the newspaper.
59:47
Oh, an endorsement?
59:49
Yeah, from one of the Milwaukee papers.
59:52
And it wasn't a pokey, little one, either, it was a major paper.
59:58
Well, the Milwaukee Sentinel Post, I think, is the major paper there, I think.
1:00:02
There might have been two back in the day.
1:00:06
So,
1:00:09
I sort of took her under my wing because nobody else had, and I was popular.
1:00:14
Do you remember her name?
1:00:16
Pardon?
1:00:16
What was her name?
1:00:17
Oh, God.
1:00:18
You
1:00:20
know, I'd have to look it up.
1:00:21
That's okay, but anyway, the story?
1:00:24
She took me out to show me what she'd done.
1:00:29
It was all reasonable,
1:00:32
measuring successful regenerations in areas that had been opened
1:00:37
up, to different degrees, which
1:00:41
is one thing.
1:00:43
There were other things, which I don't recall, specifically.
1:00:47
But they weren't innovations of any particular kind, but they
1:00:50
were means of getting at something that she was interested in.
1:00:56
Usually, it was something to do with regeneration of the forest.
1:00:59
It was graduate level work though, right?
1:01:01
Yeah.
1:01:04
So, she did quite well on writing her thesis.
1:01:10
She
1:01:13
came rushing to me one day; it was on a weekend.
1:01:18
She was
1:01:21
hoping to finish-up the work on that weekend.
1:01:24
It was sprung on me, you know.
1:01:27
I didn't know she was in that much of a hurry.
1:01:30
But Janie, my wife and I, were going out that particular night.
1:01:34
It was on a weekend, a Saturday.
1:01:36
And I said,
1:01:40
"Well, I'll look at it this weekend, but I can't guarantee that I can get it
1:01:48
back to you on Monday." She took this as
1:01:53
a rebuff.
1:01:55
I should have said, "Gee, whiz!" you know, she expected
1:01:59
a very enthusiastic reception.
1:02:02
And I should have sensed that, but didn't.
1:02:08
It came about then, that she just all but left, and nobody
1:02:12
knows where the hell she is yet.
1:02:14
That was three or four years ago.
1:02:17
Just gone, huh?
1:02:18
Yeah.
1:02:20
Wow.
1:02:22
Nobody ever tried to figure that one out?
1:02:24
Yeah, at least I'm pretty sure no one ever heard of her again.
1:02:29
Wow.
1:02:30
There's mysteries in every part of the world, huh?
1:02:33
Just like the Malaysian jet airliner that's out in the Indian Ocean somewhere.
1:02:37
Huh?
1:02:38
Yeah, I guess they still haven't found it, have they?
1:02:42
Now, you stated that you knew about long-term research before the Andrews.
1:02:47
Were there some places back east that you recall, earlier examples of
1:02:54
experimental forests, research natural areas, or even a private forest, that
1:02:59
maybe was used for such a reason that were examples of the bigger versions
1:03:04
of these that you would see out west?
1:03:06
Yeah.
1:03:07
Sure, Duke had various forests like that they had set aside to
1:03:15
observe over a period of time.
1:03:16
How far is Durham from the actual Appalachian foothills?
1:03:25
Probably fifty miles, something like that.
1:03:30
The mountains are pretty-big in North Carolina when you get to
1:03:33
the Appalachians, aren't they?
1:03:34
Oh, yeah.
1:03:35
And it's the biggest part of the Appalachians, I believe, which
1:03:37
is there in North Carolina.
1:03:39
Mount Mitchell, I think, is the highest point in the
1:03:42
whole Appalachian chain [6,684
1:03:46
feet high]
1:03:46
. Incidentally, just as an aside, when I was a graduate student, I
1:03:53
decided to take a geology course.
1:03:57
And it was a fairly general geology course on vegetation and
1:04:10
decay and so forth.
1:04:12
And so, I was in it with graduate students from several fields.
1:04:20
And I kept some track of the people during the course.
1:04:25
There was only about ten people.
1:04:28
And
1:04:30
-- Who's that?
1:04:31
My son, Stephen.
1:04:31
That's who I thought it looked like.
1:04:35
Would you mind some company?
1:04:35
Hi.
1:04:35
[Break in audio]
1:04:35
We're back on.
1:04:37
Bill's son, Steve, just joined us.
1:04:39
And so, he will be sitting in while Bill continues to go on.
1:04:44
So, he was telling us about a story as him as a graduate student
1:04:47
taking a geology class at Duke.
1:04:50
Go on, Bill.
1:04:53
Yeah.
1:04:53
We had a trip into the Smokies [Great Smokies of North Carolina/Tennessee]
1:04:56
, and back again, of course.
1:04:58
And one of those guys was a graduate student in the geology department.
1:05:02
Of course, that was a geology course,
1:05:10
and perhaps I was the only non-geologist, I don't know.
1:05:14
But anyhow, he was a nice guy, and he and I got into several
1:05:17
conversations on this trip.
1:05:20
Well, time went by.
1:05:22
We graduated.
1:05:24
I don't know, it must have been 25 years later, I get a letter from this guy.
1:05:31
Well, he had gone to Southern California on the faculty and had worked his
1:05:37
way up, and he was president of the University of Southern California.
1:05:43
Really?
1:05:44
Of USC?
1:05:46
Yeah.
1:05:46
Wow, that's quite a rise.
1:05:48
Yeah.
1:05:50
I could see him doing that because he was a pretty-smooth operator.
1:05:55
And he could probably talk his way into things that others couldn't.
1:05:59
And that's a good
1:06:09
-- Ability.
1:06:12
Ability to have.
1:06:13
I knew you could provide me with the word.
1:06:17
The ability to grease the administrative skids to the top.
1:06:23
Okay.
1:06:24
Now, let's go back to the Andrews.
1:06:26
We just started to, we talked mostly about his early career and his
1:06:30
transition, and about his education and his teaching at Oregon State.
1:06:34
But now, we're talking more about the Andrews, and some of these other issues
1:06:38
[providing context to Steve] . Now, what was your first impressions of
1:06:41
the region around the Andrews, the
1:06:45
McKenzie River Valley, and the watershed above the Blue River Reservoir, which
1:06:51
is the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:07:03
I was always impressed with the Andrews.
1:07:09
But in the early days, I didn't see anything of earth-shaking
1:07:18
quality coming out of the research that was going on there.
1:07:22
It was pretty old-fashioned silviculture,
1:07:26
period.
1:07:28
At least, that was my impression.
1:07:30
In the early years, they were mostly concerned with how watersheds would react
1:07:38
to clear-cutting, strip-cutting, you know, soil compaction issues, erosion
1:07:48
issues, and regeneration.
1:07:50
But in the “old-school” kind of sense.
1:07:53
Is that what you're talking about mostly?
1:07:55
Yeah.
1:07:56
And so,
1:07:59
I'm talking about the area, too, not just the science.
1:08:03
What do you remember about that forest, that area, that watershed,
1:08:08
the Lookout Creek watershed, which is about 16,000 hectares.
1:08:12
It's that kind of a little triangle.
1:08:15
What do you remember about the place?
1:08:19
It was a place that I always looked forward to going to,
1:08:25
because there were larger groups of trees with different sorts of
1:08:34
silvicultural work on them and so on.
1:08:38
So, it allowed you to make comparisons even though they might
1:08:43
not have done that on purpose.
1:08:46
Now, you got here
1:08:50
at OSU in the '50s; 1956, right?
1:08:50
Uh-huh.
1:08:50
'56 or '57?
1:08:51
When was the first time you went up to the Andrews, do you remember what
1:08:57
year, more or less, it might have been?
1:09:00
Gosh, it
1:09:04
probably would have been within three or four years of arriving here.
1:09:09
Now, Jerry Franklin was already a young Forest Service scientist working
1:09:16
up there, I think, starting in '57.
1:09:18
Did you meet him then before he was even a student of yours?
1:09:21
Well, I knew him, of course, he was my student.
1:09:23
Okay.
1:09:23
As a matter-of-fact, I helped him under several conditions.
1:09:30
The Forest Service was not
1:09:35
too happy with getting Jerry at first.
1:09:37
He was a guy that did things without perhaps checking with the old geezers,
1:09:46
to see that he was doing something correctly as they
1:09:52
looked at it.
1:09:53
I had him as a student, and of course, I did everything I could to support him.
1:10:01
Things came up and people were castigating him for doing this or doing that, or
1:10:05
something else, because he was different.
1:10:08
And I kept sort of nudging him, telling him that it's a good kind of difference.
1:10:18
He's a good person to put in your staff.
1:10:25
I was told that even today when he goes out into the forest,
1:10:29
he gets up the morning and he yodels or sings to the trees.
1:10:33
He does what?
1:10:34
He sings to the trees.
1:10:35
Oh.
1:10:35
[Laughs]
1:10:36
No, he's just so in love with that, that thing that he does, that he embraces
1:10:44
the whole thing in a very unique way.
1:10:50
Now, what project or projects that you worked on with Jerry or anybody
1:10:56
else in later years up at the Andrews Forest, what are some of the things
1:11:01
that you remember doing there?
1:11:05
Not much.
1:11:09
I may have given some people advice, if
1:11:14
they asked for it, but I didn't ever really have a big
1:11:27
commitment to something there.
1:11:29
But you did do projects or worked with people up there.
1:11:32
Correct?
1:11:33
Occasionally.
1:11:34
Yeah, do you remember what those were?
1:11:36
No, I don't.
1:11:38
It was more just in passing.
1:11:41
Somebody would ask, "What do you think about
1:11:46
this?"
1:11:47
What do you remember about the evolution of that place in
1:11:49
terms of its infrastructure?
1:11:52
Because when it first started, there was a road, and that was it.
1:11:56
There were trailers down at Blue River [town] , and now it's got a big campus
1:12:01
and it's a first-class research facility.
1:12:03
How would you describe the evolution of that place?
1:12:08
I think that they did what was needed.
1:12:13
It was very much justified putting in the effort and money into it that they did.
1:12:23
So, there's a lot that came out of it, I think, that some of it is new, and
1:12:30
some of it is simply fortifications of something that was done otherwise.
1:12:39
What do you believe, and this is not just at the Andrews, but any similar
1:12:45
long-term based research site where you have a longitudinal study of a place
1:12:50
and its ecosystems and its species and reference stands and streams;
1:12:55
what is the role in science, in your opinion, for that kind of place?
1:13:02
What does it do?
1:13:03
When you have stability and a known entity that you can study
1:13:07
over this enormous amount of time, what is the importance of that?
1:13:12
It's very important really because most research is set up to do a few things with
1:13:22
variations in the environment.
1:13:26
But you can't really replicate or copy the things that go on in the natural forest.
1:13:39
So, it's important to do these things with the natural forest and
1:13:45
the complications that go with it.
1:13:49
When you first started your teaching career, we talked briefly
1:13:53
about how the lecture mode was how a lot of teachers would teach.
1:13:57
That has changed over time, more or less, depending on professors
1:14:01
and schools and cultures.
1:14:04
The other thing, a parallel, was in forestry or even over at Oregon
1:14:10
State, and the Forest Service, the Forest Sciences Lab, in how some
1:14:15
people thought you could do everything in the laboratory at one time.
1:14:20
And of course, taking a point on what you just said, the ecosystem science people
1:14:26
would say, "Well, the laboratory work is important, but if you don't go out here,
1:14:34
it doesn't mean nearly as much."
1:14:37
Right.
1:14:38
It's a chemical reaction independent of the ecosystem and the biosphere.
1:14:44
Would you characterize it that way?
1:14:46
Yeah, that's a fair way to put it.
1:14:48
It's complicated in actuality, it's bound to be.
1:14:53
You can't take one simple property of something and assume that it's going to
1:15:05
tell you a whole lot about the system.
1:15:08
The system's got a lot of things going on.
1:15:12
And it's not easy to set up an experiment, or if you do, maybe
1:15:22
you won't believe the experiment, or somebody else may not believe it.
1:15:32
Now, you know Mark Harmon.
1:15:33
Correct?
1:15:34
Yeah.
1:15:36
How did you meet Mark, what were some of the interactions you had, was he
1:15:40
also one of your students, by the way?
1:15:42
No.
1:15:43
No.
1:15:44
I don't know who was his major prof. But he and I were on good terms, good friends.
1:15:51
Now, his project, the log decomposition project, is the epitome of the
1:15:59
long-term ecological research project, with a 200-year horizon.
1:16:05
Oh.
1:16:06
[Laughing]
1:16:06
If you didn't know that, Steve.
1:16:07
But you know that now.
1:16:10
And so, what do you think about that kind of study that will out-live Mark
1:16:14
and his children and grandchildren, and who knows what will be of Oregon State
1:16:19
and Corvallis and everything by then.
1:16:21
What do you think of when somebody has a project, they look out at that
1:16:25
long of a horizon, that it's going to go on long past their career?
1:16:32
It takes a lot of guts
1:16:35
by the researcher.
1:16:37
But Mark's, he's a good, solid guy.
1:16:42
I think what he's doing is well-needed.
1:16:45
And his work in carbon cycles, which is related to that, it's also very important.
1:16:52
Yeah.
1:16:53
[Break in audio]
1:16:55
You did one [study] about how much carbon is actually in
1:17:01
old growth, versus new growth.
1:17:03
I mean, you were part of it.
1:17:03
There were two, three other guys with you that you wrote that paper on.
1:17:08
Do you remember who that was, when you did that study with?
1:17:13
I think it was Mark.
1:17:15
But I'm not sure.
1:17:17
Yeah, chime in, Steve.
1:17:20
That was Steve Ferrell, by the way, so we took a break for a minute.
1:17:24
Yeah, I can't remember who the other person was, but I'm
1:17:28
pretty sure it was Mark Harmon.
1:17:30
I don't remember who the other person was.
1:17:31
Oh, that's his main thing, the study of the carbon cycle, but obviously,
1:17:37
the decomp thing is the specific thing he's really known for, his legacy, but
1:17:41
he's done other things too, in science.
1:17:43
That's what he's known for.
1:17:44
Again, it was his research that Reagan did the whole old growth is bad for the
1:17:53
environment, or something like that.
1:17:56
Reagan actually said, "Once you've seen one tree, you've seen 'em all."
1:18:00
Well, he said that also.
1:18:02
But there was actually a research paper where they were talking about
1:18:06
old-growth timber and saying that you're actually better off with new growth.
1:18:14
That ignores some of the realities, because if you get new trees, then
1:18:21
they're sucking in more timber, I mean, not timber, more carbon, out of the air.
1:18:27
Right, correct.
1:18:28
And so, the old growth is actually bad because it's not taking so much carbon out
1:18:32
of the air, ignoring the fact that there's all that carbon that's in that old growth.
1:18:36
That if you cut it down, then it starts going back up into the atmosphere.
1:18:40
Right.
1:18:42
But anyway.
1:18:43
Sorry.
1:18:48
Number one, when did you first hear the term old growth?
1:18:54
I guess when I first came here [to Oregon] . I don't believe I was, we
1:18:59
were using that [term] when I was in northern Michigan, for example.
1:19:04
Well, it's been used for fifty to sixty years, maybe longer, but it did
1:19:09
not have the cultural or scientific connotation that it had later.
1:19:15
Yeah.
1:19:17
It's been used, but it didn't mean the same thing that we know of it today.
1:19:22
But when you first heard it, it was purely a descriptive thing, correct, or
1:19:28
it didn't have a political overtone to it.
1:19:31
Right?
1:19:33
No.
1:19:34
What do you remember about Jerry, his science in old growth, and
1:19:41
describing why it was important, part of what he eventually
1:19:46
developed into the New Forestry?
1:19:49
Also, how do you see old growth and its legitimate role?
1:19:55
Well, I think, it's if nothing else, it's a part of our past that we long to see.
1:20:08
So, people talking about old growth, what the hell is it, you know?
1:20:13
There ought to be some remnants of that left, if nothing else
1:20:20
for, I think, biological reasons.
1:20:24
And
1:20:27
social reasons, I guess, too.
1:20:31
So,
1:20:34
were you ever more of a utilitarian forester who became something else, or
1:20:40
do you think that you were more, shall we say, ecologically minded, from the start?
1:20:49
Yeah, I was.
1:20:51
Would you say that's true?
1:20:52
Yeah.
1:20:53
So, when you came out here.
1:20:55
I mentioned this early on before you got here, Steve, about when you came out
1:21:02
here, industrial forestry in the Northwest was really going after World War II.
1:21:07
Were you [Bill] ever bothered by the harsh utilitarianism that often justified
1:21:15
blading it all down, and then maybe regenerating it, or not, but did that
1:21:22
bother you, just that kind of cold kind of mathematical look at nature?
1:21:28
Yeah.
1:21:30
I was sympathetic with the view that that was,
1:21:35
repetition of clear-cut and walk away, well, take something with you, but
1:21:45
- But did that bother you when you heard people talking that way, and even a lot of
1:21:50
the people I think in the [OSU] college of forestry, it was a very "get out the cut,"
1:21:55
utilitarian type of forestry being taught.
1:21:58
Yeah.
1:21:58
When you first got there, correct?
1:22:00
Right.
1:22:01
Were you a “voice in the wilderness,” or did you kind of play the game
1:22:06
and then, eventually, as you became a more senior faculty, start saying
1:22:12
something more akin to what we call ecosystem management, or did you
1:22:17
start saying your piece right away?
1:22:20
I was very receptive of the idea that we needed to take a biological
1:22:29
look at what the hell we're doing.
1:22:32
It wasn't really very smart to go around cutting everything down, and not worrying
1:22:39
about what was going to happen later.
1:22:42
When you first came to Oregon State, mainly what you were teaching were things
1:22:47
like marking trees that need to be cut down, and figuring out how much wood
1:22:53
there was per acre that could be cut down.
1:22:56
That sort of thing, right?
1:22:58
I've heard you tell me that that's what you were doing when you
1:23:01
first came to Oregon State, right?
1:23:04
So, yeah.
1:23:05
Yeah.
1:23:06
So, you started doing other stuff, was that because that's what you wanted to
1:23:11
do, or did someone at Oregon State say it would be more interesting to start
1:23:16
looking at the ecology rather than just how many boards we can cut out of an acre?
1:23:21
No, it wasn't any pressure at all.
1:23:25
It was
1:23:29
just me looking at it.
1:23:29
You just decided that's what you wanted to do?
1:23:32
Yeah.
1:23:32
What should be done.
1:23:34
And do you think that you were progressive much more than most
1:23:39
faculty when you first got there, and as time went by, more like-minded
1:23:45
people came into the OSU faculty, reflecting the broader culture change?
1:23:51
Yeah.
1:23:54
The older they are, obviously, the more
1:23:58
ancient they are in their beliefs.
1:24:01
And maybe there's an exception here or there, but that's the common thing.
1:24:09
And I didn't bother arguing with people about anything.
1:24:13
I just went my own way.
1:24:16
But weren't there some pretty vibrant debates within the
1:24:19
college of forestry about the direction of what we're teaching?
1:24:25
In other words, you have a college where a lot of Weyerhaeuser and
1:24:29
Georgia Pacific and other money [from “industry”] is pouring in there, and
1:24:32
then, of course, as culture changes in the '60s and '70s, you also have this
1:24:38
kind of what we call the post-modern revolution toward progressive ecological
1:24:44
thinking at the same time, along side the “old guard” and the old donations?
1:24:50
Didn't that create a tension that, I guess you'd say, the culture wars
1:24:55
of the post-'60s era, were played out in the college of forestry.
1:24:58
Correct?
1:24:59
I never really heard any arguments, violent arguments about it.
1:25:05
Some of the people here, old-timers, were pretty ancient in their beliefs.
1:25:13
How would you describe those beliefs and how they taught their classes?
1:25:19
The central thing usually with them, was that economics is the
1:25:26
primary thing you should consider.
1:25:28
And that depends on economics and how much,
1:25:35
is there net after you've gotten all the things done.
1:25:42
They weren't so considerate about the people that made the
1:25:45
investment, but very concerned about the people doing the cutting.
1:25:53
And that's pretty short-sighted.
1:25:56
But you would even argue, I would assume, that even from an economic
1:26:01
perspective, that it's short-sighted.
1:26:04
Because long-term sustainability is not just economic, I
1:26:09
mean, it is also ecological.
1:26:11
Yeah.
1:26:11
So yeah,
1:26:14
I understand.
1:26:14
And I'm getting into my views, and I should get away from that.
1:26:21
So,
1:26:27
how do you believe we can improve education in relation
1:26:30
to natural resource stewardship?
1:26:34
By being sure that their prior education deals with fundamental
1:26:41
biology and the things that go with it.
1:26:47
And how many years has it been since you've been retired, Bill?
1:26:57
Let's see, you retired in, well, it depends upon what you mean by retired.
1:27:02
Well, you kept teaching still after you weren't full-time faculty.
1:27:06
Correct?
1:27:07
Uh-huh.
1:27:07
That's what most people do.
1:27:10
He stopped being a full-time professor at Oregon State in
1:27:18
'81, '82,
1:27:21
I think?
1:27:22
But then, you kept teaching, at Northern Arizona, among other
1:27:26
places, and he did teach classes.
1:27:28
You taught down in Flagstaff?
1:27:30
Uh-huh.
1:27:32
You moved to Flagstaff?
1:27:34
I forget how I got there, but I took a sabbatical leave.
1:27:37
Probably by car.
1:27:38
[Laughs]
1:27:40
Sorry, that was a joke, guys.
1:27:43
Okay, how did you get to NAU?
1:27:45
I went there once, and then lived there [Flagstaff, Az.]
1:27:47
. Yeah.
1:27:51
There was a professor, who went on sabbatical, and you took his place.
1:27:56
That was the first time you went down there.
1:28:01
And then they just decided you were such a wonderful guy, and you kept going.
1:28:06
[Laughs] Yeah, right.
1:28:12
Let's see, you went to school as a freshman, to college as a
1:28:17
freshman, while we were there.
1:28:20
I was at University of Oregon as a freshman.
1:28:25
And you were still a professor at Oregon State at that time.
1:28:28
That was '78-'79.
1:28:33
And then when I went to New Mexico, it was when you went to Northern
1:28:38
Arizona, and that would have been '81-82, somewhere around there.
1:28:45
How interesting, because NAU is well-known for its forestry school.
1:28:50
And I also
1:28:53
lived in Flagstaff twice.
1:28:55
And so, how would you compare that experience?
1:28:59
Obviously, you weren't central faculty with a long history, but you went to a
1:29:05
very different ecosystem, and I'm sure a different ecosystem than for most
1:29:10
faculty, if you want to use that analogy.
1:29:13
How different was NAU from what you remember?
1:29:18
It
1:29:20
wasn't all that different, I wouldn't say.
1:29:28
I had arguments with them at times.
1:29:33
Wally, oh, I can't recall his last name, a professor there.
1:29:40
He and I were friends at first, and then we started to have
1:29:46
battles about what was the proper way to do something or the other.
1:29:53
You mean, talking about
1:29:56
ecology and forestry sort of stuff, or who should get Room 206 at noon?
1:30:04
No, it was the first.
1:30:08
He wasn't a believer in the ecology sort of stuff?
1:30:14
Well, yes, he was.
1:30:16
They had different problems, of course.
1:30:18
It's a fire environment down there.
1:30:22
And when one gets going, it was hard to stop.
1:30:27
What do you remember about the ecosystem and the forests of the
1:30:32
high Southwest compared to here?
1:30:36
Flagstaff is a kind of a high point in Arizona.
1:30:41
Well, it is the high point because of the nearby San Francisco Peaks.
1:30:44
And you're on the edge of the largest ponderosa pine forest in the world.
1:30:49
Do you remember that?
1:30:50
Yeah.
1:30:51
Do you remember doing any projects out there?
1:30:55
No, never.
1:30:56
I was planning to get something going and that never quite came off.
1:31:03
I was concerned about the loss of nutrients in the fires, usually
1:31:11
followed by a heavy rainstorm, and that washes out a lot of the nutrients.
1:31:20
Well, the climactic fire regime in the Southwest is completely different
1:31:26
than here where you have a late summer/fall fire season, where there,
1:31:31
the bad fire season is late spring when it's hot, but before the monsoons,
1:31:37
which is what you're talking about.
1:31:39
So, you get these huge conflagrations, especially in the high areas, or the high
1:31:44
chaparral, and even the ponderosa pines.
1:31:47
And then shortly after is the monsoon season, which would be what you're talking
1:31:51
about concerned with the nutrients.
1:31:53
Correct?
1:31:54
Yeah.
1:31:58
Do you want a drink of water or something?
1:32:10
This is stealing some words from another interview of yours.
1:32:16
You say that you want to introduce rationality and good ideas, and
1:32:23
for forestry and natural resource management, to not be just
1:32:26
focused on custom and practice.
1:32:29
I mean, you said that, so do you want to tell me what you meant by that?
1:32:34
Yeah, you want to repeat the last part of it there again?
1:32:37
That you wanted to introduce rationality and good ideas into forestry and
1:32:43
natural resource management, so people wouldn't be focused just
1:32:47
on custom, tradition and practice.
1:32:53
That
1:32:55
is true, in some places more than others.
1:32:58
For example, in the Northwest, they've been doing the same thing the same
1:33:05
way since year one, it seemed to me.
1:33:11
It's changed now some, but the old
1:33:17
logger approach to things is
1:33:23
still problem in the Northwest.
1:33:31
They're good at knocking trees down and hauling them off, but they're
1:33:37
not particularly good at seeing what the implications are in some
1:33:41
places where that's a bad move.
1:33:47
Where do you think clear-cutting is appropriate, and where do
1:33:51
you think it's not appropriate?
1:33:57
Well, it's the more moisture that you have, why the more you
1:34:04
can get away with clear-cutting.
1:34:07
But the drier it gets, of course, then, the other direction is bad
1:34:15
news if you use clear-cutting.
1:34:17
It dries out the surface and
1:34:23
increases the threat of fire, which could wipe
1:34:33
you out.
1:34:33
And there's no reason why they should do it that way, except it's probably
1:34:39
the cheapest thing to do, but not when you factor in the loss of seedlings that
1:34:48
you're going to have,
1:34:51
and the things that you have to do to compensate.
1:34:51
What kind of selective cutting do you find appropriate?
1:34:57
A few different models, for instance?
1:35:01
For
1:35:03
areas where you're growing pure stands or essentially pure stands, it's not
1:35:12
the thing to do at all, I don't think.
1:35:16
If you have a mixed stand, well, that's something else.
1:35:21
What happens when an area becomes too mono-cultural?
1:35:26
In other words, tree farms, so to speak.
1:35:30
Any kind of a disease they get or insect infestation, can go through
1:35:36
it like wildfire, potentially.
1:35:39
You're always taking a heavy risk when you do that.
1:35:45
Now, I believe at your first professional job at University of Idaho, you did
1:35:51
research on the western white pine.
1:35:54
Do you want to tell me about that; there were two diseases
1:35:58
in particular that you studied?
1:36:01
And maybe what were some of the other things that you see affecting the
1:36:07
forests here since you got to Oregon?
1:36:11
Yeah.
1:36:14
The thing in Idaho with those forests, there's a problem that
1:36:24
the thing
1:36:26
they'd sprayed and had done various things to, but because the fungus
1:36:33
thrives under that condition.
1:36:36
But
1:36:42
the question is: Is the cost of the spraying of an insecticide or a
1:36:49
fungicide worth it or
1:36:53
not?
1:36:53
It depends, I think, on the terms of the quality of the site.
1:36:57
If it's a very high-quality site, a forester would say, Site Class
1:37:05
1, that might sway the thing toward spraying the area and doing other things.
1:37:15
Since you came into your professional life,
1:37:20
we've come from the pre-Silent Spring era, Rachel Carson's famous
1:37:26
book, to everything that came after.
1:37:28
And
1:37:30
that applies for all the herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, etc. that we
1:37:36
used to indiscriminately put on the land.
1:37:39
How do you remember the mindset and what people were doing in those early
1:37:43
days, and then, how that changed?
1:37:45
Obviously, we're fifty years after that, but the big change started
1:37:49
to happen in the '60s and '70s.
1:37:51
What do you remember about that?
1:37:53
I think people became aware of the possibility that the
1:37:59
spraying that they were doing is
1:38:03
a worse outcome than anything else they could do.
1:38:10
They're killing things that they shouldn't kill.
1:38:15
Because you can't control if they spray that much.
1:38:22
Pretty toxic stuff.
1:38:23
Remember when they discovered about DDT?
1:38:25
Uh-huh.
1:38:26
Remember how that used to be poured on everything, and then all of a sudden,
1:38:30
they discovered how it accumulated in the food chain, all the way up to whatever,
1:38:35
the high trophic levels, I think it was falcons and eagles and stuff like that,
1:38:40
and bats, especially, was one of them.
1:38:46
One of your co-professors used to drink the stuff.
1:38:50
How's that?
1:38:51
One of your co-professors used to drink the stuff!
1:38:53
Which stuff?
1:38:55
The DDT.
1:38:55
Do you remember that, Mike?
1:38:59
Mike Newton?
1:39:00
Is he the professor that used to spray that stuff on his body and brag about it?
1:39:05
He drank it.
1:39:07
At a news conference.
1:39:10
Do you remember that?
1:39:11
Is he still alive?
1:39:12
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
1:39:14
Does he glow in the dark?
1:39:16
[Laughs] I'm sorry.
1:39:17
You don't remember that story?
1:39:18
No.
1:39:19
Yeah, he had a news conference.
1:39:22
It was in the newspaper.
1:39:23
I thought he drank some herbicides.
1:39:31
Well, I have to admit, I can't remember which one it was he drank.
1:39:34
But you do remember him drinking the stuff.
1:39:36
Right?
1:39:37
Yeah.
1:39:38
And thinking maybe possibly that's one thing for him to
1:39:41
do, but he is having children.
1:39:43
Maybe not such a great idea for his children?
1:39:49
[Break in audio]
1:39:49
We're back on now, and Steve is going to ask a question of his father.
1:39:53
Do you know how the Andrews Forest got selected as this is the place
1:39:57
to create, and what was of interest there such that they did that?
1:40:02
Was it just the opportunity, they just had the availability of the land, or
1:40:05
-? I think they had enough variety in it.
1:40:08
And
1:40:12
they felt that, well, the variety would be the thing, as much of the range
1:40:18
as they could get in a small area.
1:40:22
For being able to study it scientifically, they wanted a variety of ecologies?
1:40:27
Yeah.
1:40:29
And forest types, also?
1:40:32
Yeah, probably.
1:40:33
That isn't the real thing, the points of interest are
1:40:41
usually not some broad subject, but rather the detail part of the thing.
1:40:50
And we need variety to do that.
1:40:55
Do you know who set that up, that they would get the Andrews Forest, and that
1:41:02
would be what it would be used for?
1:41:03
I don't know.
1:41:05
I remember reading something about it, but I'm not sure where I read it.
1:41:12
The fellow that knew most about that forest, unfortunately, died.
1:41:19
Oh, hell, what's his name, was his name?
1:41:23
A very nice guy.
1:41:26
Retired from the Forest Service and from research.
1:41:31
Jack Rothacher?
1:41:32
No.
1:41:33
Ted Dyrness?
1:41:34
No.
1:41:36
Dick Fredriksen?
1:41:37
Huh-uh.
1:41:38
Jim Sedell?
1:41:42
Huh-uh.
1:41:45
I'm running out of names.
1:41:46
Oh, gosh.
1:41:48
Those are people that have passed, I believe, that's why
1:41:50
I was coming up with the list.
1:41:52
I'm not sure, but.
1:41:55
They had a house right beside the cemetery up on
1:42:00
-- Up on Country Club Hill?
1:42:04
Where we lived.
1:42:05
Oh,
1:42:08
right by the entrance to the cemetery?
1:42:19
I can't think of their names, either, sorry.
1:42:21
He was a very nice guy.
1:42:23
He ended up drowning in the ocean.
1:42:29
They'd go on a trip to the South Pacific with some friends.
1:42:35
[Roy Silen – see below]
1:42:38
Oh, what was his name?
1:42:39
I can't remember.
1:42:41
But, was he an Andrews’ scientist or a Forest Service guy?
1:42:46
Yeah, it was Ted Dyrness.
1:42:47
Oh well, Dyrness lived till fairly recently.
1:42:53
Rothacher passed many years ago.
1:42:57
Roy Silen was the first scientist.
1:43:01
Is that the guy?
1:43:02
That's the guy.
1:43:03
Okay.
1:43:04
Roy Silen was the first scientist/manager that worked, really was at the Andrews.
1:43:13
And then he got married to some woman here in Corvallis.
1:43:16
And he came back and didn't want to be in the field anymore, so he had like the
1:43:20
first few years of the forest as Blue River Experimental Forest, and then, after
1:43:24
1951, became the H.J. Andrews in honor of the passing of Andrews in a car crash.
1:43:31
And Silen, but he was only here, there till '54 or '55, I think.
1:43:38
Was that the guy you're thinking about?
1:43:39
Yeah.
1:43:39
Yeah, it looks like Silen, S-I-L-E-N, but it's Silen, as he pronounced it.
1:43:47
I think you went to school with his daughter.
1:43:51
No, that was Kathy.
1:43:56
Yeah, I remember.
1:43:58
Okay.
1:43:59
Roy had successive
1:44:06
bad luck.
1:44:08
His wife was killed in a car crash where she was the driver.
1:44:14
She was apparently yacking to people in the back seat, went right
1:44:20
through the stop sign, and bam!
1:44:23
And later, Roy was swimming in the Pacific with some friends in the South Pacific.
1:44:31
They flew over and spent some time on this island.
1:44:38
And he went off to swim, and all at once, he disappeared.
1:44:44
Wow.
1:44:44
Did they ever find him?
1:44:46
Oh, yeah.
1:44:48
But to say, this is kind of a dark moment in the interview here, but he
1:44:55
was up at the Andrews in 1996 doing a group interview as part of the original
1:45:02
set of interviews which we are now following up on eighteen years later.
1:45:07
He found out via radio that his wife had been killed when he was up on Carpenter
1:45:14
Mountain, or somewhere out in the Andrews.
1:45:18
I guess it was an end-of-the-day interview that became a very tearful,
1:45:25
emotional experience, obviously for Roy, but everybody else,
1:45:30
who were tremendously impacted.
1:45:31
I've
1:45:38
talked to Fred [Swanson] about it, but it's a very sad story.
1:45:43
But so, he actually passed away in the South Pacific?
1:45:46
I never heard that.
1:45:48
He was out there swimming and with, oh, I guess, a half a dozen other guys.
1:45:54
And then suddenly they noticed he wasn't there.
1:45:58
And he somehow went out, whatever happened, I'm not sure.
1:46:04
Wow.
1:46:05
He just drowned.
1:46:08
How strange.
1:46:09
Now, speaking of other old alumni from the Andrews, did you know any
1:46:13
of those folks, like Jack Rothacher.
1:46:15
Did you know Jack?
1:46:16
Yeah.
1:46:17
Do you want to tell me anything you remember about Jack?
1:46:22
I didn't have that much contact with him.
1:46:24
I knew him but
1:46:25
- He was a field guy.
1:46:26
He lived out there in Blue River and even South Umpqua, for many, many years.
1:46:30
He was one of the main field guys for a long time.
1:46:34
Now, did you know Dick Fredriksen?
1:46:36
Oh, yeah.
1:46:38
Anything about Dick you want to relate or stories or worked with him,
1:46:42
or what you knew about what he did?
1:46:46
Gosh, the name is very familiar, but I don't know that much
1:46:51
about what he was doing.
1:46:53
How about Ted Dyrness?
1:46:54
Yeah.
1:46:55
You must have known him pretty-well, because he and Jerry, you know,
1:46:58
did all that work on vegetation and wrote the book, still the seminal
1:47:03
book on Northwest vegetation.
1:47:05
But what about, did you know Ted pretty well?
1:47:07
Tim?
1:47:07
Ted Dyrness, did you know him pretty-well?
1:47:10
Yeah.
1:47:11
Want to tell me about him?
1:47:12
Personally, he was a very friendly, outgoing guy.
1:47:18
And he always impressed me as being knowledgeable.
1:47:22
But I don't know specifically about things he was doing.
1:47:29
Now, you told me early in the interview, that at first, you didn't
1:47:34
think there was much exceptional going on at the Andrews in terms of the
1:47:38
science, it was pretty-standard stuff.
1:47:42
Now, what do you think are the important scientific discoveries that you know about
1:47:46
that came out of the Andrews, especially in the LTER era, in which it's become a
1:47:55
famous ecological research site, globally.
1:47:58
And what do you know about some of the areas that have been important and
1:48:02
that the Andrews have been a part of?
1:48:11
I can't lay my finger on them, probably just off-hand.
1:48:14
That's okay.
1:48:15
That's all right.
1:48:18
OSU and the Forest Service co-administration of the Andrews
1:48:22
today can be held up as a model for effective inter-institutional
1:48:27
management and science.
1:48:30
What do you know or remember about the evolution of the Andrews
1:48:35
and its place in relation to the OSU/Forest Service relationship
1:48:41
in terms of science going forward?
1:48:44
Not that much.
1:48:45
Not too much.
1:48:51
Now, as an OSU professor and researcher, what was your experience
1:48:54
working with the Forest Service?
1:48:57
They were very cooperative.
1:49:00
And I was as cooperative as I could be.
1:49:05
And it was also because I knew the researchers personally, and
1:49:11
had a high respect for them.
1:49:13
There was Jerry, of course, and
1:49:18
the fellow that drowned, that I was mentioning.
1:49:21
Roy [Silen]
1:49:22
. Roy, yeah, he was, he did good research.
1:49:34
You used to take your classes down to the Andrews Forest.
1:49:36
Do you remember what it was, what particular things you were
1:49:40
showing that were of interest for your classes down there?
1:49:42
Yeah, they had a watershed that,
1:49:51
in turn, had a barrier down at the bottom.
1:49:55
You might call it a dam.
1:49:58
It was a small stream, so not a huge thing, but they were there
1:50:04
to measure the water flows.
1:50:07
And in a pond behind the dam, a small dam, there was a study of water insects.
1:50:24
This is in what part of the Andrews?
1:50:27
Lower down.
1:50:28
On Lookout Creek then?
1:50:31
Yeah.
1:50:33
Way down at the bottom.
1:50:36
Now, do
1:50:38
you remember the trailers that they had up there at one time?
1:50:43
Oh, to live in?
1:50:45
Yeah.
1:50:46
They used to call it the “ghetto in the meadow?” [Laughter]
1:50:51
Yeah, they replaced that with legitimate housing.
1:50:56
It took them a long time, though.
1:50:58
Yeah.
1:50:59
Did you ever hear about the time when the guy taking the shower, because
1:51:03
the floor was rotted, the shower fell through the floor of the trailer?
1:51:07
No.
1:51:11
[Laughs] That and a few other stories, are the classics of the “ghetto in the
1:51:14
meadow.” Fortunately, I don't think he was injured, but there were rats
1:51:19
and mice, and it's a far cry from what you see up there now, which is
1:51:24
quite a palace in a relative sense.
1:51:29
Okay, I think we're almost done.
1:51:31
Now, going back
1:51:38
to
1:51:47
your time in Southeast Asia, and what you saw.
1:51:53
You looked at aerial photography and that was your main job, analyzing that?
1:51:58
But also, seeing the jungles and the whole thing.
1:52:02
Go into some specifics about what you thought being exposed to, that
1:52:07
completely different world gave you for everything that came after it, at
1:52:12
Duke, at Oregon State, and everything, whether it be in science or just as a
1:52:16
person living in a developed country.
1:52:21
It was a radical change, for sure.
1:52:25
But we didn't live really in the communities we were stationed at.
1:52:32
Right.
1:52:33
Because we didn't have close relationships with the native people,
1:52:41
which was sad.
1:52:43
You
1:52:46
know, there were good people and bad people in those societies,
1:52:51
just there are in ours.
1:52:53
And about the only exception, we decided, there was a small group of
1:53:00
us, about six, decided that we should learn some of the multiple languages.
1:53:08
There are, I say, plural languages, because there are about three
1:53:16
of equal in that area, about three equal in importance.
1:53:23
There were different backgrounds.
1:53:25
And
1:53:30
we took lessons from them for about, oh, I don't know, three weeks maybe.
1:53:37
Was this in Burma or Calcutta?
1:53:39
In Calcutta.
1:53:40
And that would have been Bengali?
1:53:42
Yeah.
1:53:43
The language.
1:53:47
But unfortunately, it didn't really satisfy the needs because you
1:53:56
never knew who you were talking to.
1:53:59
They're all mixed up, physically-speaking.
1:54:03
In other words, the dialect could have been mixed with whatever?
1:54:09
Correct?
1:54:10
There's Hindi, and, oh, what the hell was the one for the Muslims, who were,
1:54:20
there are surprising number of Muslims in the Calcutta area at that time.
1:54:25
They started to move out about the time we were leaving there.
1:54:30
Well, after independence, but before the division.
1:54:33
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they had bloody
1:54:40
battles with the native people in the country who were, they should be speaking
1:54:46
Hindi, if they were from that area, but there were a lot of them who were Muslims.
1:54:57
We took lessons, but it didn't really pan out that well because you
1:55:04
never knew who you were talking to.
1:55:07
Did you go out into the jungle too much when you were in
1:55:10
Burma or anywhere down there?
1:55:12
I mean, did you have a chance to really experience that ecology,
1:55:16
that aesthetic, that geography?
1:55:21
Yeah.
1:55:22
We were up in northern Burma,
1:55:27
close to China.
1:55:29
And
1:55:32
a friend of mine was
1:55:36
stationed up in the hills.
1:55:41
His job was to look for airplanes, Japanese airplanes, and report them.
1:55:51
If there was more than, let's say, two or three, why, that
1:55:58
was a potential for a raid.
1:56:01
And so, he would
1:56:05
put it on the air, that is, he had a small transmitter,
1:56:11
all the way back in Burma.
1:56:14
And he was
1:56:17
not in Burma, but over in Assam, the province of Assam.
1:56:23
Do you remember how the natives and the jungle managed their forest, or
1:56:28
do you remember anything about that?
1:56:31
No, never did.
1:56:32
They
1:56:36
didn't seem to have much interest in managing.
1:56:40
They were more interested in staying alive, right?
1:56:43
During the war.
1:56:48
If you were going to
1:56:51
reflect back on your life and career, what would be, what would
1:56:57
you like people to remember you for?
1:57:03
Having good children.
1:57:06
Politically correct.
1:57:07
Okay, ignoring my presence.
1:57:09
Politically correct answer.
1:57:10
Steve is not really here, this is a hologram.
1:57:15
Yes,
1:57:18
there are three of them.
1:57:19
And he's only one.
1:57:22
But the important one, of course.
1:57:24
Yeah.
1:57:26
Politics are all local.
1:57:28
But
1:57:31
really, that's obviously very important.
1:57:33
But other than having a good family, how would you like people to remember you?
1:57:37
I mean, your teaching legacy is one reason people love you for
1:57:42
what and how you taught them.
1:57:43
I mean, your former students speak glowingly of you.
1:57:48
How does that make you feel in terms of that legacy?
1:57:51
Well, a very good feeling about it.
1:57:56
Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't just a feeling out of professional
1:58:03
things, but personal things.
1:58:08
Obviously, we talked about Jerry Franklin, but how many of your former students have
1:58:12
kept in touch with you over the years?
1:58:14
I mean, you don't know a number, but
1:58:19
- ? Not that many.
1:58:20
No?
1:58:21
They're very happy to see me when I happen to show up but, you know,
1:58:23
they don't go out of their way.
1:58:28
Now, is there anything else that you would like to say during this
1:58:32
interview that we haven't addressed?
1:58:34
Any of the stories that, you know, you already went over some of your
1:58:39
interesting stories like the grad student that disappeared and you never
1:58:43
found out what happened, that one.
1:58:45
Anybody else, anything else?
1:58:51
Oh, it was kind of weird.
1:58:54
We were out in the Cascades, and in a vehicle or it was a bus.
1:59:05
And we got off the bus, I said, "I'd like you to go out there and
1:59:12
write a description of the forest. And tell me what you saw in the
1:59:17
way of regeneration," and so on.
1:59:21
"Come back here in a half-hour." So, one of the guys, as it turned out later,
1:59:30
most of them went out for a half-mile or something, and then came back.
1:59:36
Well, he took off and went for about three miles, which brought him out on a road,
1:59:44
which looked like the road we come up on, to him, but it wasn't like it at all.
1:59:49
But at any rate, he thought he'd found the road we came on.
1:59:53
So, he walked down the road and walked down the road, and walked
1:59:56
down the road, and couldn't find us.
1:59:58
And he managed then to hitch-hike from a car, and by good luck, the
2:00:06
car came and turned onto the road we were on, where we were parked.
2:00:13
And so, he found his way back.
2:00:16
And fortunately, we hadn't spent too much time trying to find him,
2:00:20
but it was kind of touch-and-go.
2:00:23
That was an interesting story.
2:00:27
I think one of the main things, that in speaking to my father's
2:00:33
former students, what they appreciated about him was two things.
2:00:37
One is that there were, it wasn't just a discussion of him
2:00:41
broadcasting to them, but that it was a discussion between everybody.
2:00:46
And that I think was pretty rare in the days when you first started
2:00:49
teaching, in a much more of the lecturer sort of mode by most professors.
2:00:55
Yeah, we talked about that early, before you got here, I talked about how you
2:00:59
seemed like you were probably not just a “lecture-at-the-students” kind of teacher?
2:01:05
I remember that when I was a kid, walking into
2:01:10
his classes a couple times because he was going to give me a ride
2:01:13
home, and everybody was talking.
2:01:16
And I remember being impressed by that, as opposed to what happened in my classrooms.
2:01:22
And the other thing was that beyond just talking in the classroom, you
2:01:27
took kids, your students, out, and you went and you looked at the stuff.
2:01:33
You went out into the woods and you showed them what you were talking about.
2:01:37
And I think that that was also different from what a lot of professors were doing.
2:01:41
You wanted them to see what, what it was you were discussing, and to
2:01:45
be able to identify it themselves.
2:01:48
Yeah.
2:01:49
And I don't think other professors were doing that back then.
2:01:52
And we had more transportation maybe then.
2:01:58
Why did you love teaching?
2:02:01
I always liked to get people thinking straight about things that they may have
2:02:10
known about before, but misunderstood.
2:02:13
But
2:02:17
I can remember my enthusiasm about first finding some things, and so it was a
2:02:24
privilege to be able to tell the other people about it, and illustrate it by
2:02:32
things you see in the field.
2:02:36
For example, it didn't always work that way, by the way.
2:02:41
We were off on a drive, and I said, "Oh, hey look, there's some balsam fir." And
2:02:47
the student sitting next to me said,
2:02:52
we were on a first-name basis, "Bill, that isn't balsam fir."
2:02:59
[Laughs] It's a fir, but it was not balsam fir.
2:03:04
It looked like balsam fir, so I assumed it was, but he was right, I was wrong.
2:03:09
Did you like being corrected by your students?
2:03:15
[Laughs]
2:03:15
Yeah.
2:03:17
Well, so it goes.
2:03:21
What is your favorite place in Oregon?
2:03:26
Or what are some of your favorite places in Oregon, or the Northwest?
2:03:29
I was going to say, it's more than one, certainly.
2:03:33
One would certainly be on the coast.
2:03:36
I can always remember you guys piddling around at the coast,
2:03:44
looking for some mussels or whatever.
2:03:50
The tide pools?
2:03:52
Yeah.
2:03:53
Yeah, the gardens over there, something, gardens, what are they called over there?
2:03:59
It's kind of toast nowadays.
2:04:02
Kind of like Seal Rock, and places like that, or
2:04:05
-? Yeah, it's something like Undersea Gardens, but that's not right.
2:04:09
Oh yeah, it used to be called the Undersea Gardens.
2:04:13
Except that all the things that were there when I was a kid
2:04:16
are, it's pretty much dead.
2:04:18
There used to be all kinds of
2:04:19
-- Yeah, they were supposed to police the place, and prevent the
2:04:24
kids from running off with all the mussels and other animals.
2:04:29
And probably some pollution must be getting in there for it to, or it might
2:04:33
be climate change has impacted it.
2:04:36
Oh, yeah, it's impacting everywhere.
2:04:38
Even though it's not happening.
2:04:40
Yes.
2:04:43
Okay.
2:04:45
What other places, the coast?
2:04:47
What's your favorite place in the Cascades, you got a
2:04:51
favorite place or places?
2:04:53
Yeah, we used to do hiking in the Cascades.
2:05:00
Where'd you go?
2:05:01
Oh, the
2:05:05
easiest, most accessible places.
2:05:08
Take the main highway across and when you get up to the crest, there's a
2:05:16
trail that goes north-south, and we have been on that trail a number of times.
2:05:26
[Pacific Crest Trail]
2:05:26
. The Santiam or McKenzie?
2:05:27
Santiam.
2:05:29
Okay.
2:05:30
So that's up by Washington, Three-Fingered Jack, or the Three Sisters or
2:05:35
- Yes.
2:05:37
The whole “schmeer.” [Group of peaks in central Cascades]
2:05:39
. Yeah.
2:05:42
Maybe once in a while, there'd be a new wilderness place would be created and
2:05:46
we'd go wandering off to go check out the wilderness place that someone had created.
2:05:52
Our
2:05:54
old friends, the
2:05:55
-- Irgen-Moellers [Helge]
2:06:05
No, they, and also the
2:06:07
-- Leaches.
2:06:08
[Charles]
2:06:08
Leaches.
2:06:09
But the
2:06:12
Leaches, seniors, their mother and father, have both died in the last
2:06:18
year or so, so it's the end of that.
2:06:22
So, were you the same with your kids that you were with your students
2:06:25
about teaching life experiences?
2:06:31
[Laughs]
2:06:32
Didn't ever lose any of us.
2:06:33
A few students once in a while, but
2:06:35
- Yeah.
2:06:36
I'd
2:06:41
say we're about finished.
2:06:43
So, I would like to thank you, Bill, you Steve, and Fred, who left, for
2:06:50
taking part in this afternoon session which I think was very productive.
2:06:54
And we'll just go, Thank you, thank you.
2:07:00
Yeah.
