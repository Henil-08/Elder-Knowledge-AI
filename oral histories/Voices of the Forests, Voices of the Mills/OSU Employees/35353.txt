00:12
Hello.
00:12
My name is Sara Khatib, and this research is for my master's thesis.
00:16
The research involves the history of different traditions of science
00:19
at the Andrews Forest and the philosophical perception of nature that
00:23
underlie these different traditions.
00:25
I would like to ask you a few open-ended questions regarding these topics.
00:30
I expect the duration of the interview to take up to one hour to complete
00:34
but maybe up to two hours depending on your interest and knowledge.
00:38
Would you like to participate in this interview?
00:41
Yes, I would like to participate.
00:43
Thank you.
00:44
Alright.
00:44
I want to inform you we can end the interview at any point you wish to do so.
00:50
Just please inform me right away if you no longer want to participate and
00:54
the interview will immediately end.
00:57
Do I have permission to record this interview?
00:59
Yes, you have permission.
01:03
Alright.
01:07
Just before we begin, I want to offer a brief summary as to why we are here today.
01:11
As you know, there is currently a collection of oral histories in
01:15
the Oregon State University Special Collections and Archives Research
01:18
Center titled, "Voices of the Forest, Voices of the Mills." That collection
01:23
consists of stories on people's personal backgrounds and how their journeys
01:27
have led them to the Andrews Forest.
01:29
It also consists of stories that illustrate certain political and cultural
01:33
transitions, such as the transition away from the timber era to the
01:37
conservation era and the planning for the Pacific Northwest Forest Plan and it
01:41
discusses the overall culture of LTER.
01:45
Today we are going to build from that by asking more direct questions
01:49
about your personal philosophy and practice of science and then scale
01:52
up to the philosophy and practice of science on the community level.
01:56
This interview will inform the writing of my master's thesis, where my research
02:00
questions ask 1] what are the different traditions of science that characterize
02:05
the Andrews community, and 2] what are the philosophies of nature that
02:09
underlie these different traditions?
02:11
Today I'm here with Dr. Barbara Bond, a former Principal Investigator for the
02:15
Andrews Experimental Forest, and her expertise is in physiological processes,
02:20
especially water and carbon relations at whole-tree and forest ecosystem scales.
02:27
I want to begin, before getting into the questions that I had sent you,
02:35
let me just try to get both these screens up so I can see you as well.
02:40
If you can offer a brief summary of your training as a forest ecologist.
02:47
A little bit of background, since that is not currently
02:49
present in the oral histories.
02:52
Okay.
02:53
I am going to precede that by just saying after listening to you and your
02:58
introduction I want to interview you and find out how you got to where you are and
03:05
I'll do what you need, but I really wish it was the other way around
03:10
because you really intrigue me.
03:13
But, okay, so I'll try to keep this brief.
03:18
I think that a lot of my colleagues who end up in forest ecology grew
03:23
up in areas in pristine forest and they were drawn to it from childhood.
03:29
I'm not that person.
03:31
I grew up in a coastal town in southern California and my only desire was
03:38
to go to the beach every day and play in the waves and read novels
03:44
and I was passionate about reading.
03:47
As a young person, I gravitated especially to mathematics, but also
03:54
to the sciences, physical sciences, chemistry, even more than biology.
04:00
Again, I think that is a little different early background
04:06
than many of my colleagues.
04:09
I went to college at the University of California Irvine and started out as a
04:15
math major, because again math was my first love, and after about a year and a
04:22
half, I noticed that my friends who were studying other subjects were, the way
04:32
they applied that, especially in biology they were going out in the world and
04:38
touching and feeling plants and animals, whereas I was sitting indoors with a book.
04:43
I still loved the math, even more than I loved biology, but I loved the doing of
04:49
the process that my friends were doing.
04:51
I switched majors to biology and kind of split that between ecology, because
04:59
I loved being outdoors, but frankly, I didn't like the academic side of ecology.
05:06
Again, probably different from many of my colleagues, because to me it
05:09
was so descriptive, and I was far more interested in sciences that
05:17
where I thought there was more fundamental discovery.
05:20
I moved into genetics at that time.
05:23
I still love, love, love genetics as a discipline.
05:29
I ended up, my undergraduate degree, with a focus in both genetics and ecology and
05:34
I went for initial graduate training, which I didn't finish, to UC Davis where
05:41
I enrolled in a Ph.D. genetics program in evolutionary genetics, which very
05:49
much had an ecological component to it.
05:53
21,
05:56
22 years old, absolutely not mentally prepared for the rigors of a Ph.D.,
06:03
dropped out and this was an era, and I think you probably know enough
06:09
about history to know that the era of
06:13
1968 to mid 1970s was politically traumatic.
06:18
I dropped out and just kind of wandered around for a while.
06:24
Ended up a few years later getting teaching certification, because I knew
06:30
I needed to have a way to employ myself and ended up getting certified to teach
06:37
secondary school, taught junior high school for a few years, went crazy
06:43
because I yearned for science again.
06:48
I finally enrolled in a real graduate program that fit me and I was mature
06:55
enough to be able to handle it.
06:57
I think by then I was in my late 20s, early 30s in, ecology at
07:04
Oregon State University, so I had moved up from California and
07:10
that was
07:15
a real revolution to me, to my way of thinking, because I could do the process
07:21
that I loved, which was being outdoors and wandering around, but also do some really
07:25
fundamental, more mathematically-oriented, physiologically-oriented, process-level
07:35
science that also really appealed to me.
07:38
I did a master's degree having to do with leaf-level physiology in conifer forests
07:47
and kind of bounced around after that.
07:51
I won't give you all the gory details, but ended up just loving the physiology
07:57
part of it, loving the being outdoors part of it and ended up years later much
08:04
older than average, I think I was 38 when I started a Ph.D. program in the
08:10
Department of Forest Science at OSU.
08:14
Part of what was awesome for me then was getting connected
08:19
with a set of mentors that
08:24
respected me.
08:28
I guess that's the best way to put it.
08:33
Just as a sidestep, this was also a huge transition of the previous
08:39
decade of the welcoming-ness of women into this kind of discipline.
08:47
I was never prevented, as many women older than me were prevented,
08:53
from going into graduate school.
08:55
Nobody's ever told me no you can't do this, but nobody never told me
09:00
yes, we really want you to do this.
09:02
That's a really different thing.
09:04
When I started in my Ph.D. program it was in an environment where people
09:08
said we're really impressed by you.
09:11
We think you can do well.
09:12
I never heard that before and I look at my female students now and younger
09:20
colleagues and I think they just expect to be helped and respected.
09:27
I was blown away to be respected and it made all the difference to me, truly.
09:36
I did a Ph.D. in the Department of Forest Science at OSU and had a lot
09:45
of mentors to help me, particularly Richard Waring who is, I don't
09:50
know, have you interviewed him?
09:52
I'm sure he must have done an oral history.
09:54
Yeah.
09:54
He's a big name in the Andrews.
09:59
He taught me so many things.
10:01
I didn't always like him, I have to say.
10:03
Sometimes he just drove me crazy.
10:05
But he was an amazing mentor, and I had a lot of other really good
10:10
mentors at that period of time, too.
10:16
I went ahead, got a Ph.D. during the time that Dick Waring was very involved
10:22
with NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and he was not then
10:28
working at the Andrews at all, but had gravitated using remote sensing using
10:35
light aircraft to doing remote sensing.
10:38
I really gravitated to that.
10:41
I found quite exciting because it was a lot of process-level science.
10:47
There was a lot of scaling of what we knew about leaf-level physiology into
10:51
canopy-level, if not global-level, implications, so my early career as
10:58
a scientist involved a lot of that kind of thinking, in part also because
11:05
NASA was spending a lot of money
11:10
supporting ecological science.
11:13
I think many of us, as scientists, tend to go not just where our hearts
11:19
are, but also where we can get funding.
11:21
That's one of the things I always recommended to my students.
11:25
Your heart can cover a lot of base, so go where you can be
11:29
supported in your work and remote sensing definitely did that for me.
11:35
I also at that time, my Ph.D., another huge mentorship opportunity that meant
11:42
a lot to me, I did a dual major in Forest Ecology and Plant Physiology.
11:48
I was required in that dual major to do a course in radio isotopes, which
11:55
I thought was not going to be useful.
11:58
That was an era in ecology that, I don't know whether this is something that is
12:04
part of your world, but stable isotopes were just becoming a really important
12:12
focus for ecological research and so Dick Waring, my mentor, encouraged
12:19
me to walk across campus, go to a guy in oceanography who was using stable
12:25
isotopes to study oceanography and he did a one-on-one tutorial just with
12:31
me for many months where together we learned how to apply stable isotopes
12:39
into ecology, which was new then.
12:41
He asked me to do a little project and so Dick Waring, my major professor and I,
12:48
decided hey let's just see what's going on with stable isotopes in trees and Dick
12:54
took me out to eastern Oregon where he took a shotgun, shot a bunch of foliage
13:00
out of trees and we just for fun decided to look at isotopes in trees of different
13:08
sizes and it turned out they were dramatically, statistically different.
13:14
The question of why set us off onto an inquiry that was
13:20
at the time ground-breaking.
13:22
I know right now it has become dogma, but at the time it was absolutely
13:29
not accepted within physiology that the size of an organism could affect
13:34
how its leaves functioned and the stable isotopes suggested that it did.
13:41
I got seriously into that at the same time as I got into remote sensing, was
13:47
able to get some funding from the National Science Foundation to pursue that.
13:52
Again, money is everything.
13:55
I spent, this would be the late '90s, but it's the early part of my Ph.D. career
14:02
doing some incredibly exciting, what ended up I think groundbreaking research, and
14:11
at the same time, again, the kind of positive feedback I got from my colleagues
14:17
saying, wow this is really great, reinforced my sense that I belonged there.
14:25
When you feel like you belong somewhere you just want to do it more and more
14:28
and more because it feels so good and you know you can make a difference.
14:32
I loved that.
14:34
For several years I supported myself as a scientist, as a soft-money scientist,
14:44
is that a term you're familiar with?
14:47
Soft-money scientist means I was still associated with the same
14:52
department where I got my Ph.D., but I didn't have a formal appointment.
14:58
I'd finished my Ph.D.
15:00
I was there.
15:02
I wrote some grants.
15:04
Through those, and they were successful, and I got some money that supported
15:08
me, and I got an appointment as, I don't know, adjunct professor.
15:13
I don't even know what I was called at the time,
15:18
but I kept writing proposals and getting money and doing research
15:23
and I had very little responsibility other than that because I didn't
15:26
have a formal appointment.
15:27
That was a lot of work but a very exciting time.
15:33
Then a lot of personal changes happened in my life.
15:37
I was very insecure writing those proposals.
15:42
A windfall happened to me, that my department head had been asked to directly
15:49
appoint another man who was in my position directly into a professorial position.
15:58
My department head knew that he could not possibly get the university to
16:03
accept that, because, all of a sudden, white males were not the very best
16:08
thing anymore, and there was a lot of pressure, thank goodness for affirmative
16:14
action, and so my professor called me in and said what if we at the same
16:21
time as this man give you a direct appointment to a tenure-track position?
16:26
I said, yeah [laughs] . I'll take that.
16:34
This is connected with the Andrews.
16:36
Part of the expectations that man gave me as a hired, tenure-track professor was
16:47
to do the lump of research at the Andrews Forest, which I had not been doing.
16:54
It was my job expectation and I thought, sure.
17:00
If you're paying me a salary and you want me to do work at the
17:03
Andrews, I will work at the Andrews.
17:05
Of course.
17:06
I had no research questions or anything.
17:10
It's just yes, of course, there's trees there.
17:13
I'm working on trees, and I'll figure out something to do.
17:18
I'm rambling on too long, Sara.
17:20
Tell me if you want me to speed this up.
17:24
A side story here to going to the Andrews is, and I've been meaning
17:29
to tell you this later on, but in my opinion one of the more interesting
17:36
developments at the Andrews was that early on, of course Jerry Franklin was
17:42
the guy who was just really in charge.
17:45
I'm sure you're familiar with that.
17:47
But in the very early years of forming the LTER program, in the early years of IBP,
17:53
Dick Waring was right there with him, the two of them working very closely together
17:57
with very different worldviews, and that's your thing, apparently, is worldviews.
18:03
Dick is very process-oriented, very physiologically oriented.
18:07
Jerry has always been more structure and characterization,
18:16
especially of old growth.
18:18
The two of them philosophically did not always get along, but they did
18:24
some of, in my opinion, the best science that ever happened at the
18:28
Andrews together because it brought both of those perspectives together.
18:34
But as time went on, Jerry stayed at the Andrews.
18:38
Dick found a lot of other things to go to.
18:41
By the time I came into the fold with Dick Waring he wasn't associated
18:45
with the Andrews Forest at all.
18:47
Although he's a very mature, polite man, and would never say anything
18:51
negative, it was clear that there was a little bit of good riddance in his
18:57
mind that he was on to greener pastures and let them do their stuff there.
19:02
When I, this is like a decade or more after Dick parted to do other things,
19:09
when I moved back into the Andrews it was a really interesting world for me,
19:14
because most of the people who were working there were progeny, if you will,
19:20
of Jerry Franklin, and I was an offspring of Dick Waring with a different view.
19:31
I was definitely welcomed into the fold, very much so.
19:35
Nobody said, "Hew, we don't like the way you think you've got to get
19:39
out of here", but I did have a very strong sense that "these people" [air
19:45
quotes] did science differently than I had been trained to do science.
19:53
But, again, they welcomed me in.
19:55
I got like $6,000 from Mark Harmon, who was then PI [Andrews LTER grant
20:00
Principal Investigator] , to set up a little project and then I did some other
20:03
things and those projects scaled up.
20:09
I think maybe I'm at the end of the prologue, because I've
20:14
gotten myself into the Andrews.
20:16
I've told you my background and maybe we're ready to go onto other questions.
20:22
What do you think?
20:23
Yeah, that was really, really good informative information.
20:26
I just want to follow up on a couple of clarifying points, if I may.
20:30
Sure.
20:31
Do you mind explaining-I'm aware of the contrasting worldviews of Jerry
20:37
Franklin and Richard Waring, but in your own words do you mind getting a little
20:40
bit more in depth in explaining what you mean by structure versus processes?
20:44
Just
20:47
explaining that or defining that.
20:48
Yeah.
20:53
I'll try.
20:54
I don't know if I'm going to get there in a really good way.
21:01
If I think if you were to ask Dick Waring back in the day when they were working
21:08
together what characterizes, say, [of] an old growth forest [stand out] to you?
21:15
He would talk about
21:19
what the leaf area index is, how much foliage there is per unit ground area,
21:24
what the photosynthetic ability of that was, what the growth rates were, what
21:31
the efficiency was per unit sapwood area of leaf area, and where the
21:39
carbon went, a lot of interest maybe in relating nitrogen composition of foliage
21:48
to its carbon relations, very much
21:55
biogeochemical process with a focus on the big autotrophs, the big trees.
22:02
I think at the time if you were to ask Jerry, even now, and most of
22:07
his people about old growth forests, or the streams, he would talk about
22:15
the dead and dying large trees,
22:22
the processes of
22:28
fire coming into a forest and how new trees grow after the fire and the
22:38
processes of a developing forest and what that forest looks like through different
22:43
age classes and age groups, maybe what the distributions of different species
22:48
are, maybe relationships between the animals in that forest and how they
22:55
interact with trees, but it's very much, oh and deadwood on the ground, for sure,
23:03
very much these are the characteristics, if you're going to go out and touch and
23:08
feel everything, and especially watch it through time, because he's very time
23:13
oriented, whereas Dick is far more what's
23:19
the carbon assimilation per unit ground area
23:26
per unit leaf area and where does that carbon go and how
23:31
much nitrogen do you need?
23:33
Then later on for Dick and me it would be well, if there's a drought, how does
23:40
that affect that carbon assimilation and the water use and what is the
23:45
implication to the species composition of the forest because of that?
23:52
Those are examples, not definitions, but does that help?
23:56
Yes.
23:56
Certainly, it does.
23:59
Together, Dick and Jerry published a paper in Science in late '70s, '79 I
24:07
think, "Characteristics of Old Growth Forests in the Pacific Northwest,"
24:12
or something very much like that.
24:15
I think that paper is one of the best examples I can think of, of the comingling
24:21
of two very, very smart people who think really differently but work together.
24:29
[Waring, R. H.; Franklin, J. F. 1979.
24:31
Evergreen coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest.
24:33
Science.
24:33
204: 1380-1386]
24:34
That was published, was it, in what year 1970-?
24:37
I think it was 1979, but I can follow-up and, that in Science.
24:44
Great.
24:47
So then at that this points we can transition to our first section of
24:52
questions which will focus very much on your personal philosophy and practice,
24:56
which you touched on a little bit, and we'll get more in depth on that.
24:59
Sure.
25:00
I want to start with asking you how would you define a forest ecosystem
25:06
and/or ecosystems in general?
25:10
Okay, so first I want to thank you very much for giving me these questions in
25:14
advance, because if you had asked me that out of the blue I would've wanted
25:19
so much to give you some amazing, personal definition and I realize I
25:28
very much like classic definitions of an ecosystem as just the assemblage
25:36
of all the living things in a set place and that abiotic environment
25:43
that they're in and there's no set
25:49
size or physical limits on that.
25:53
You define that according to your interest.
25:58
An ecosystem is very real.
26:01
I'm looking out my window.
26:03
I live within a south-facing oak forest ecosystem, and I love it very much.
26:11
It's real.
26:12
But the concept of ecosystem, like the concept of almost everything
26:16
in science, is artificial.
26:20
Whenever, and I know I'm going to get back to this with other things we talk
26:24
about, we have to define terms, but we can also get so hung up with semantics as
26:32
we define those terms and that can really get in the way of creative thinking.
26:36
Anyway, an ecosystem is just a bunch of plants and animals, living
26:42
things, microorganisms in the abiotic environment that they're sitting in.
26:47
That's an interesting point that you bring up, so to clarify-in ways, concepts are
26:53
tools, right, and they help in terms of communication and finding common grounds
26:57
for thinking about things but also, they become dogmatic in the sense that we just
27:01
forget to think outside of them, is that-?
27:05
Yes.
27:05
Or, if I'm looking, it's that old adage about I'm looking at the elephant's foot
27:12
and you're looking at the elephant's trunk and we have an argument about no,
27:18
it's like this and there's these thorny nails on it and no, it's like this.
27:21
It's pliable and it moves around.
27:23
But it's all those things, right?
27:28
It does such a disservice to ourselves if we get hung up with how we think
27:33
differently rather than that, oh well that's interesting, yes, it's
27:37
all the same thing and I'm just looking at a different part of it.
27:41
Great.
27:42
Thank you.
27:43
How would you describe the nature of an ecosystem?
27:48
What are its characteristics, and some examples are is it static?
27:52
Is it dynamic?
27:53
Or is there order or is it just pure chaos?
27:57
Are they very resilient?
27:58
Are they fragile?
28:01
Yes.
28:01
Yes.
28:02
Yes.
28:04
All of the above [laughs] . I don't know how-I can't imagine coming to any other
28:10
conclusion than all of those things.
28:14
When I read this at first, again, I have this background in genetics and
28:19
evolution and in evolution there is a concept of punctuated equilibria that
28:27
has guided evolution through all of evolutionary history that there are
28:34
these times of stasis and times of chaos.
28:40
The greatest change, and often we would call that in reflection, advancement,
28:48
happens after a period of chaos.
28:53
Scientists sit within a particular focus of space and time and so we tend to get
29:02
hung up with their own little bit of space and time but an ecosystem, I we
29:10
could just sit like in my oak forest or if I could just watch this change
29:14
over millennia, there would be times of massive chaos and times of great
29:21
stasis and that's the best I can do.
29:26
Systems are all of the above and I think scientists who are close to it,
29:37
sometimes have difficulty explaining to others that a chaotic event is not bad.
29:44
It's just normal that you can't have a system that doesn't go
29:51
through chaotic events and then become stable again, but many people
29:57
are very uncomfortable with that.
30:00
It's hard to explain to people who don't do that - that that's okay.
30:06
It's okay.
30:07
A total destruction really is okay, if there's renewal.
30:11
That renewal might not take it back to the same point.
30:15
It might go to a different point altogether, again using the analogy
30:22
of evolution, human beings would never be on this planet if whole,
30:28
massive systems of organisms hadn't died out because of some catastrophe.
30:34
Does
30:37
that analogy make sense?
30:39
It does.
30:40
It's interesting because it makes me think about the dialectic
30:43
between science and culture, and specifically ecology and culture.
30:46
I feel like culturally we haven't really been, we're not really adept at
30:51
facing uncertainty and facing change.
30:55
That's one of my fundamental, core beliefs.
30:59
One of my core beliefs is that we all need to be comfortable with uncertainty
31:05
and the more comfortable you are with uncertainty, the happier you're going
31:10
to be and the better you're going to be able to live in your world.
31:16
That's interesting and it seems like that might be a potential cultural revolution
31:22
occurring in our outlook on the world.
31:23
I think that it parallels a lot with science as well and
31:28
our perceptions of nature.
31:31
Correct me if I'm wrong, in previous stages in ecology an ecosystem
31:35
was depicted as a bounded thing.
31:39
Yes, sure.
31:39
You had an idea of a climax stage, right?
31:43
Sure.
31:44
Yeah.
31:46
That's an evolution in thinking and scientists who came up with
31:50
those concepts, it's not wrong, but we had to go through that
31:55
developmentally in order to come to some different levels of understanding.
32:01
I
32:04
agree with you completely.
32:06
This term punctuated equilibria-it's about through time there are moments
32:13
of order, and they shift to moments of chaos and it's this irregular pattern?
32:19
Exactly.
32:23
Again, to me I'm probably more comfortable with the idea even in
32:29
evolution than I am in ecology.
32:32
I think ecologists, Fred Swanson in particular, are definitely starting
32:36
to embrace this sense that massive disturbances happen and that's normal
32:44
and then there's change and at any one time it might look like things are
32:51
static, but actually it's just a period of time between disturbance events.
32:58
Those disturbance events in ecology are analogous to,
33:03
I guess, what in genetics and evolution we call punctuated equilibria.
33:07
That punctuation is a disturbance, which often in evolution is mass extinction.
33:19
Interesting.
33:19
This also, I think, ties a lot with the current existential crisis that we're all
33:23
facing of climate change, the idea that there's not necessarily a return point
33:28
but [hands gesturing in flowing motion]
33:29
. Oh yeah.
33:32
Just to go off on a tangent, since you mentioned that.
33:34
I personally have
33:39
a lot of difficulty putting my own thinking down because sometimes I think of
33:44
climate change just as one of another in a series over billions of years of massive
33:55
event that was brought on by people on themselves and people may end, human
34:01
beings may end up suffering from it a lot.
34:03
But if I put myself in the seed of whatever exists a few billion years
34:10
from now looking back on it, it will be an interesting little story about how
34:14
this little species on earth that didn't last all that long destroyed itself.
34:20
I can't help but think of it in that way, even as I think it's appalling what we're
34:27
doing to each other in the here and now.
34:32
But it's also another chapter in the story.
34:36
Yeah.
34:37
It really is.
34:38
It really is.
34:39
Even as I think it's awful, it's also maybe inevitable and normal.
34:48
But yet we're not equipped to perceiving change and uncertainty,
34:51
to tie back to our earlier-
34:53
It is so true.
34:56
Great.
34:57
When you were talking about your background, one of the first
35:02
things that you mentioned was your draw towards mathematics.
35:05
I'm
35:08
wondering in terms of that initial early interest early on in life, as well as
35:14
your interest towards the physiological aspects of ecology, how do you think
35:18
those interests and your training in those interests influence your theoretical
35:24
and philosophical approach to science?
35:33
Well, obviously, it all gets wrapped up into who I am and what I am.
35:45
I like discovery.
35:48
I just really like discovery and I like discovery that is
35:57
on a pathway to understanding how things work, how things work always
36:03
intrigues me a lot more, and, so, that's the physiology part of it.
36:08
I'll go beyond that, rather than just what is there.
36:13
I think there are a lot of people who love and good for them because we need
36:20
that, understanding what what's is there and how there changes over time.
36:27
I'm just really interested, and I think it's innate.
36:31
I think it's almost like saying having brown hair versus blonde hair.
36:36
That's not better.
36:37
It's just different.
36:39
I like, well how does that work?
36:43
Huh.
36:43
That's interesting.
36:48
When I told you the story about the stable isotopes that was just an observation
36:53
that came out of needing to do something with stable isotopes and never expecting
36:58
that anything would really come out of it.
37:02
Once there were some differences, I can't help but say, "Wow, why?"
37:09
Those stable isotopes are there or because of some functional differences
37:13
in the leaves that we were sampling and I just, I'm just drawn to those
37:20
questions of how does that work?
37:23
How does that work?
37:27
Maybe I can draw some analogies.
37:30
When I was a very small child,
37:34
I taught myself to knit.
37:39
I watched old ladies knitting and I got a book, and I got some knitting needles and
37:44
I just really wanted to know how you could create this thing with these two sticks.
37:49
Then later my mom had a sewing machine.
37:53
She didn't like to sew.
37:56
I don't know if you've ever looked at a sewing machine, but it's just
37:59
crazy that this needle comes down and this bobbin comes around and
38:03
it loops and it connect things.
38:05
I just, I probably was only about 6 or 7 at the time, but wow.
38:11
How does that work?
38:13
That kind of thing has always just really driven me.
38:17
It isn't necessarily the natural world.
38:21
It often isn't the natural world.
38:23
It's just, whew how does that work?
38:26
Even if somebody
38:30
has a very different opinion than I do about something, I want to know
38:34
how did you come to that conclusion?
38:36
I like to know how things work.
38:40
That's not a philosophy.
38:41
It's just something innate in me.
38:45
Do you mind explaining what you mean by that's not necessarily the natural
38:49
in terms of like it's not necessarily inherently having these functions
38:53
or purposes, is that what you mean?
38:58
Yeah.
38:58
I'm not sure.
38:59
Maybe you could try to rephrase what you just said, and I'll try to listen really
39:04
hard and get the right wavelength here.
39:09
I'll step back a few sentences.
39:11
You describe the how and why versus the what.
39:15
The how and why is the analytic and the what is more of the descriptive minded.
39:20
But then you said the how and why is not necessarily the natural world.
39:24
So, if you mind explaining that point.
39:28
Oh.
39:28
I didn't say, ah.
39:30
Good.
39:30
Thank you.
39:30
I might have said it's not the natural world, but I didn't mean to say that.
39:34
I meant that my interest
39:38
of the how and why apply to the natural world, but they can go into
39:43
many other realms than just ecological interactions or biological interactions.
39:57
I'm trying to think of an example.
40:00
Again, a good example of something that wouldn't be necessarily
40:03
ecological would be again
40:07
somebody coming up with a different opinion than I have and wanting
40:11
to know please explain to me how you came to that conclusion?
40:15
I like to know the roots of things.
40:19
The hows of things.
40:21
It includes both the natural world and other phenomena that may be
40:25
outside of what we think of as ecology or biology or nature.
40:31
I
40:33
think that sometimes I'm apologetic about this, I'm not as singularly an
40:41
ecologist as many of my colleagues are.
40:45
I love ecology, but what I really love is inquiry and I ended up
40:50
applying that in an ecological context which it was the best career ever.
40:59
But I think I could have been pretty darn happy doing that in many other areas.
41:09
Thank you.
41:10
Then, what about how this approach or philosophy is applied in practice?
41:18
For instance, usually the descriptive is equated with a
41:22
more observational approach.
41:25
Yes.
41:25
Then analytic is potentially experimental but also modeling has [SK inaudible]
41:32
. Yes.
41:32
How would you describe your style in terms of practice?
41:39
Certainly, myself personally, I lean very, very strongly over
41:46
to the experimental and modeling side of things, no doubt about it.
41:59
I don't think science as a whole benefits from people just like me.
42:08
I very strongly feel, and this probably gets back into the Andrews culture that
42:14
we all desperately need these different ways of thinking in order to come up
42:19
with a full picture of what's going on.
42:23
I just don't-back to what I said about Dick and Jerry coming up with that paper.
42:28
Neither one of them would have done that on their own.
42:31
They need that cross-fertilization of ideas and it's rare in academia
42:41
to have an environment that forces the people who think these
42:46
different ways to get together.
42:50
Again, I'm not sure I was comfortable at first at the Andrews just because
42:54
of that, but I'm a died-in-the-wool believer now that that is what it
43:01
takes to come up with really good,
43:07
useful science,
43:11
answering important questions.
43:16
I didn't exactly answer.
43:18
Again, I think it's all of the above.
43:21
No double, I personally lean very, very strongly to the
43:25
physiological, experimental side.
43:28
Most of my colleagues when I started out at the Andrews did not, except for
43:32
those people who were in biogeochemistry.
43:37
There was a legacy of excellent biogeochemistry research: Phil Sollins,
43:44
and some others that was experimental and very much functional before I came.
43:49
There was nobody when I started that was asking questions about the autotrophs
43:57
of plants that were more functional.
44:01
I felt alone at first, but it ended up being a very good thing.
44:10
I think, too, the really unique aspect of the Andrews as a community is all these
44:17
diverse [audio cuts in and out]
44:18
. I think it's true of other LTERs, but maybe I am biased, but I really do
44:24
think the Andrews has done a better job than most in blending those
44:31
different ways of thinking and accepting those different ways of thinking.
44:36
It is
44:40
a perfect example of diversity; diversity takes
44:45
so many different kinds of tones.
44:48
This is diversity in scientific thinking and diversity brings strength.
44:54
There's just across the board, whether it's cultural or
44:59
biological or anything, diversity
45:04
is more likely to cause disruption, but it brings strength.
45:09
Did I answer that completely?
45:12
Yes,
45:16
certainly.
45:17
If I could just probe a tiny bit further, too, because correct me if I'm wrong,
45:22
but it seems like the general trend, especially after Waring left, is most
45:25
people were in the descriptive camp, of the observational camp, right?
45:31
That's my sense.
45:33
Except for the biogeochemistry group.
45:36
Right.
45:37
As somebody who leans towards the experimental, do you mind explaining
45:42
what draws you towards that and what you feel like the benefits and
45:49
what makes experimental work, I suppose, and what contribution does it have for
45:54
your personal, scientific understanding?
45:58
Right.
45:59
Again, I think there is some degree an innate component, like some
46:07
people have blonde hair and some people have brown hair or blue
46:10
eyes and brown eyes, and whatever.
46:11
Some people are male.
46:12
Some people... there's just something innate.
46:16
I innately ask how does that work?
46:21
That's not better than what's here but that's what I do.
46:27
It's how my mind works.
46:31
Your question was not that, though.
46:35
It was, why?
46:37
Why do I think that way?
46:39
Well, what are the benefits of an experimental-what do
46:43
experimental approaches offer to science as an enterprise?
46:46
Well,
46:50
it's, of course, again, in the context of it's all really important.
46:58
I don't think one can do good experimental work without a whole lot
47:03
of fundamental descriptive work to be playing with and to feed into that.
47:09
In my view, they kind of toggle back and forth.
47:15
I often
47:18
in what I do see that the experimental inquiry follows the more descriptive.
47:28
That's actually not true.
47:29
It's more that they kind of go back and forth and back and forth.
47:33
You can't possibly, I don't think, ask good questions for experimental
47:40
work unless you have a great deal of fundamental understanding of
47:52
the descriptive aspect of what you're working on, because,
47:58
again, back to that stabilize isotopic example I gave you.
48:00
I could never have posed good questions about what ended up hydrologic functional
48:08
differences as a function of size if I hadn't had that just descriptive, if you
48:15
will, huh: big trees have a different isotopic composition than little trees do.
48:20
That's totally descriptive.
48:29
What the experimental work gives you an opportunity to do
48:39
is to pose questions about how and determine and to sort out whether your
48:50
explanation is likely to be true or not.
48:52
I
48:55
guess this is part of the philosophy that I love, you never achieve truth.
49:01
You only approach it.
49:04
Just as in punctuated equilibrium, the same things happen with truths in science.
49:10
You go along a certain way, and you believe that certain things are
49:13
true and then something happens.
49:16
Oh, my Lord.
49:18
There's DNA and it can copy itself with each generation it splits itself
49:25
and it just changes everything.
49:26
It just changes everything.
49:30
Experimental approaches give you the opportunity
49:36
to pose a question and find out whether different possible answers are
49:42
likely to be true, and it's powerful.
49:46
It's really powerful, but it doesn't work on its own.
49:49
They're inherently linked, then.
49:53
Yeah.
49:55
To jump down a couple questions and I'll go back because you touched on this
50:00
so I think it would be good to segue.
50:03
As a researcher how do you use the scientific method to find truth?
50:07
Or what would you even define as truth in science?
50:15
I found that a fun question.
50:21
I told you that I used to teach junior high school science.
50:26
Of course, scientific method is something that you do.
50:29
I learned a lot about the scientific method or the dogma of scientific
50:35
method in trying to teach it to junior high school students.
50:39
I taught them the whole you come up with a hypothesis, you come up with a good
50:44
test and then you find a-I found out through watching children do this what a
50:52
big crock it really is unless you're able to take them much more deeply than that.
50:59
Just posing a hypothesis, like the way it often ends up people follow these
51:07
set steps of scientific method, and you know you've got to have a hypothesis so
51:12
your hypothesis basically becomes your best guess at what you think the outcome
51:18
is going to be of your experiment.
51:20
So often people do the experiment in their mind first, then they
51:23
come up with here's what I think the experiment is going to be.
51:26
That's my hypothesis.
51:29
Then you're usually right because you design your experiment to
51:33
show your hypothesis is true.
51:35
It really looks like you're following the scientific method.
51:38
I
51:41
have serious reservations about "the scientific method" [gestures air quotes
51:47
in sarcastic tone] because I think that it can be applied so poorly and
51:54
at the same time that method of inquiry which, you know, the philosopher's Karl
51:59
Popper and whoever else, came up with these ideas and they're very useful,
52:05
but it's not a one-size-fits-all thing.
52:07
It depends on what you want to do.
52:12
It seems to me, and it always has seemed to me since I've been a
52:15
mature scientist, that what's really important, what's fundamental is
52:20
the good researchable question.
52:22
That's what's hard.
52:24
That's what is really hard is coming up with the really
52:27
good, answerable questions.
52:30
Then the scientific method is coming up with elegant ways to attempt to show
52:40
whether alternate explanations or alternate answers are or not true.
52:48
Following some rote routine just makes people trip up, but, fundamentally, if
52:54
you try to come up with a good question, try to come up with potential answers to
52:59
that question, try to come up with ways to determine which answers are likely to
53:05
be true or not likely to be true it's a very, very, very powerful thing to do.
53:14
That appeals to me.
53:15
That's where my thinking goes.
53:18
What about the concept of truth, which you touched on a little bit, in science?
53:23
What do you think is truth?
53:27
Well, that's a lovely question, especially in light of the politics we've had in the
53:31
last few years and the changing truth.
53:33
Yeah,
53:36
I think that
53:40
in an ideal world a very good scientist knows there's no such thing as absolute
53:46
truth, but that the greatest goal of your work is to come close to that,
53:54
but to be willing to change, be willing to say, "I thought this was true and
54:00
here's evidence, strong evidence, that it's not true and so I'm going
54:06
to start exploring ways of changing my thinking." It's like that's what you
54:12
and I were talking about earlier about
54:16
stability, about uncertainty.
54:19
Truth, to a degree, is uncertain, but that is very different from posing
54:26
alternate facts, which is what our previous administration was doing.
54:32
It's adhering to the truths that the best evidence of the time supports and
54:40
being absolutely willing to say, that was wrong because the evidence is different.
54:47
Part of the experimental method, I think, is coming up with evidence
54:54
to help you change your truth.
54:56
Does
55:00
that make sense?
55:00
It does.
55:01
That makes a lot of sense.
55:02
So, then that kind of requires a degree of flexibility, right?
55:07
Of course.
55:09
You have to be flexible.
55:12
You have to be flexible about being willing to change your truth, but I think
55:17
we should be absolutely inflexible about the idea that we need to seek truth.
55:25
We need to seek truth and to adhere to the truths that the best
55:33
evidence supports, rather than the truths that are most convenient.
55:38
That makes me think again of a political thing, of Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth,
55:42
like climate change is an inconvenient truth and people are denying that
55:46
truth because it's really inconvenient.
55:51
All the evidence points to human-caused climate change.
55:54
Maybe somebody can come up with some other explanation,
56:01
and I'm willing to listen to that and I think all good scientists should
56:05
be willing to hear other evidence.
56:07
As long as through preponderance of evidence points in some direction, we
56:12
just have to be willing to accept that no matter how it fits with our other dogmas.
56:18
Then your point earlier, too, is interesting, with the
56:18
way that you described it as
56:23
similar to
56:26
the concept of punctuated equilibrium, but also punctuated truths, right?
56:31
Yeah.
56:32
I never had said that before, but I actually really like that.
56:35
Because if you look at the history of science we've gone through periods of
56:41
time where we think certain things, well, later on you talk about laws and
56:46
we had times, the mechanical world where we knew F=ma as always true and then
56:53
Einstein comes along and wait a minute it's true within this sphere of time and
56:58
space, but you get out somewhere else and there's something else that takes over.
57:03
We have to be willing to go, "Whoa that's hard to grasp but it's true."
57:11
To continue with that, what are your ideas about, what do you believe
57:16
that there are laws of nature?
57:18
What are your ideas about that?
57:19
I think I just quickly went into my thinking about that.
57:23
By the way, I just love this.
57:26
I love this style of thinking.
57:28
Thank you so much.
57:29
I haven't had a conversation like this in a really long time and it's so much fun.
57:39
I'll go back to what I said earlier about not getting too hung up with a definition,
57:44
like in science books there's: this is a hypothesis; this is a law; this is a
57:51
theory and they put definitions on them.
57:54
I think you get in trouble when you are hard and fast about definitions.
58:01
But I think there are natural phenomena that we can expect to always
58:09
happen, always, always, always happen in our sphere of time and space.
58:14
I think that in physics the mechanics, the mechanics laws in physics are
58:19
some of the best I can think of.
58:21
Gravity, for example.
58:24
You drop something and it's going to fall.
58:27
It's going to fall at a very predictable rate.
58:32
That is a good law.
58:35
But you get out into space-time continuum and curved space and it is different.
58:41
So, that law isn't an always law.
58:44
It's just a law that always works for us.
58:47
I like the notion of laws of nature as long as we qualify that it is
58:52
within our sphere of time and space.
58:57
That's not a definition.
58:59
What about in the living world?
59:02
In ecology?
59:06
I'm going to answer that, but I just remember something else I wanted to share
59:09
about laws when you posed that and I was reading it here, and that is that I think
59:14
the word "law" is unfortunate because outside of science people interpret
59:21
that the way that we have political laws, like somebody sets this law.
59:27
If we say there's a law of nature many people's minds go to the fact that there
59:32
is something that created that law, that there is like a god, maybe, or some
59:43
conscious entity that set the law.
59:48
I do think a lot of people think that way and that creates a lot of
59:52
misunderstandings between scientists and non-scientists because really
59:57
that law is there because of the way that matter interacts with itself
1:00:03
and how it got started, like at the very origin of the universe, is a
1:00:08
really big question but it does.
1:00:11
It isn't necessarily because some thing or maybe something did, but I don't think
1:00:17
we need to have a conscious being that creates a law for the law to be there.
1:00:23
But the public doesn't understand that, or a lot of the public doesn't.
1:00:30
That's my little segue.
1:00:31
In biology, sure,
1:00:35
yeah, so, if a law, as I was just saying, are things that we can predictably
1:00:40
think are always going to happen under a certain set of circumstances
1:00:49
sure there are laws.
1:00:55
Laws-males and females
1:01:03
reproduce.
1:01:05
They don't always, any pair of them are not going to reproduce, but offspring
1:01:15
happens when males and females comingle.
1:01:18
I think that's kind of a law.
1:01:21
I'd have to think about putting that together in a better sense.
1:01:28
In most circumstances, death happens.
1:01:34
There are organisms that don't die, but most organisms do die, and we don't
1:01:39
know exactly why and that's something that I was exploring near the end of
1:01:43
my career, is the inevitability of death because I think it's fascinating.
1:01:47
I think death is pretty much a-it's fuzzy on the corners, but
1:01:54
it's a good general law of nature.
1:01:56
Things die.
1:02:00
I could think of a lot of other ones, but yes there are laws of nature.
1:02:05
Change happens.
1:02:06
There's a good one.
1:02:07
Change will happen.
1:02:10
Things may not change right now, but they always will eventually.
1:02:15
Yes,
1:02:19
there's laws in biology and in ecology.
1:02:25
I think we are, in ecology especially, more bounded by general principles
1:02:33
rather than laws, that things that usually happen rather than always happen.
1:02:38
That in-between.
1:02:39
Would you like
1:02:43
to take a 5 to 10-minute break at this point?
1:02:51
I'm good to go on these questions for a while.
1:02:53
I'm actually really loving it.
1:02:56
I'm really-I told you this is way more fun than I was even anticipating.
1:03:02
Good.
1:03:02
I'm glad.
1:03:03
Here I'm
1:03:08
going to-alright.
1:03:08
A couple more questions for this section, to go back: what
1:03:13
are your thoughts in regard to objectivity in scientific research?
1:03:20
Right.
1:03:24
Again, I just love these questions.
1:03:26
I decided that what I think about objectivity is it's similar to a
1:03:32
truth, that it is an ideal that we aspire to, but never actually achieve.
1:03:43
It's a good goal, but no human being can be totally objective, but we to try to be.
1:03:52
I guess
1:03:55
that's the best-I guess I would add to that that science works
1:03:59
best when we are objective
1:04:03
to a point.
1:04:04
No, I don't really believe that.
1:04:06
Never mind.
1:04:07
I don't think I believe that.
1:04:08
I think we should try to be objective, but the passions that we bring about the world
1:04:17
do inform what we choose to study and the vigor with what we choose to study.
1:04:22
That's not objective.
1:04:24
That's totally non-objective, like if
1:04:29
you
1:04:32
just love big old trees, like I do, just love them.
1:04:36
That's not objective.
1:04:37
I just love them.
1:04:39
That's going to make me approach my work with a different level of passion.
1:04:43
That's a good non-objective sense, but in terms of the questions we ask that
1:04:50
goes back to being willing to change our mind about a truth because we have
1:04:58
to stay open to new ideas, which is I guess the part of being objective.
1:05:04
I bungled that, but
1:05:07
that's the best I can do.
1:05:11
Then, the next question, which in my opinion is one of the most important
1:05:14
questions, what are your overall motivations, like why do this work?
1:05:21
Why do science?
1:05:22
Is it for curiosity?
1:05:23
Is it for real-world solutions?
1:05:25
What is the incentive behind it?
1:05:28
Right.
1:05:33
That is like saying are you a good person or-I have to be, admit to what
1:05:40
I view in myself as a personal feeling.
1:05:43
I am much more driven by seeking truths than I am by solving real-world problems.
1:05:54
But I wish I were more driven by solving problems.
1:05:57
I admire that, but the way I work is that I just like answering questions.
1:06:09
Answers are very important, in my opinion.
1:06:11
I also sometimes, like with philosophy, too, a lot of people
1:06:15
kind of think what's the point?
1:06:17
We have all these issues we need to be addressing.
1:06:20
But I think it is all connected, right?
1:06:22
Yeah, it is.
1:06:24
It is.
1:06:26
Again, I guess it's why we need to have lots of different people working in groups
1:06:31
together who are bringing those different kinds of emotions and perspectives.
1:06:35
I remember having a huge disagreement with a colleague who maintained that unless a
1:06:45
particular scientific endeavor was going to lead to a, she used the term, useful.
1:06:53
Useful.
1:06:54
Another colleague used the term usable in contrast with useful that science that
1:07:03
wasn't useable or useful was not good.
1:07:09
I fall back on all of the inquiry that people have done, like Darwin even, that
1:07:18
wasn't useful or usable in the moment, and, fundamentally, just changes our
1:07:26
perspective on how everything works.
1:07:30
I'm not sure I agree with that idea that any inquiry has to be useful or useable in
1:07:40
the moment, because we can't anticipate.
1:07:42
Nevertheless, there's stupid science to do and there's-and I don't think we
1:07:49
always know, but if somebody, well, I can't think of examples of bad science,
1:07:55
because it probably could end up good.
1:07:58
But I do think there are important questions and non-important questions,
1:08:02
and the important questions aren't necessarily improving humankind at
1:08:09
the time that they are explored.
1:08:13
They're fundamental questions that we should-maybe astronomers are really
1:08:17
good at having a handle, they've got that cornered, that figuring out
1:08:24
how many planets are there and how fast do they move?
1:08:27
Is
1:08:30
there life somewhere else?
1:08:32
They're just asking these really fundamental questions.
1:08:37
The public doesn't seem to have a problem with those questions, but if somebody
1:08:41
just wants to know is this species of fish different from that species of fish and
1:08:47
is it going to die out for some reason, a lot of the public doesn't like that.
1:08:54
I don't know.
1:08:54
I'm not answering your question very well.
1:08:56
No, I think you are.
1:09:00
There's also, I think, a spectrum, right, between curiosity, or I've heard people
1:09:05
term it big science versus applied.
1:09:09
I feel like they're connected via a law or something.
1:09:13
So connected.
1:09:14
They are so connected.
1:09:18
I am more of a basic scientist.
1:09:23
Basic scientists really need the applied scientists to take their little things
1:09:30
that they come up with and explain it and use it in the world, but the
1:09:36
applied science, obviously, you give up basic science or fundamental...
1:09:41
it's like in industry having R & D, Research and Development.
1:09:45
You can't have a good business without a component of R & D that's going on
1:09:50
in developing new ideas for the future.
1:09:53
I really do like the notion that basic science often provides the grist for
1:09:58
the mill of future applied science.
1:10:02
I think that's really a good answer.
1:10:04
Even if it just explains
1:10:10
how evolution, how monarch butterflies turn different colors
1:10:15
in industrial England and how and why did that happen and what is
1:10:22
the fundamental internal force?
1:10:25
That's just basic, fundamental science that just makes our world better,
1:10:31
just like a piece of art or a piece of music makes our world better.
1:10:37
That's interesting that-I wasn't going to ask this question at this, but
1:10:40
because you brought it up-something recently at the Andrews Forest in
1:10:44
the early 2000s was the emergence of the Arts and Humanities Program.
1:10:48
What are your thoughts about the presence of Arts and Humanities and the interface
1:10:52
between science and Arts and Humanities?
1:10:57
I could hardly be a stronger enthusiast than I am of blending those entities.
1:11:05
Before I became involved with the Andrews, I had a really strong sense all my life
1:11:11
that good science was a work of art.
1:11:17
A really good scientific endeavor or a really good scientific, mathematic proof-I
1:11:23
think that's where I first came across that notion-is just like a beautiful
1:11:29
painting or a beautiful piece of music.
1:11:32
They're just the same.
1:11:34
It's a creative, beautiful, intrinsically beautiful endeavor.
1:11:40
It's art.
1:11:42
It always frustrated me that it was hard for me to communicate with
1:11:46
my artist friends how that that beauty was exactly the same to me.
1:11:54
A beautiful proof in math is exactly the same as a beautiful
1:11:58
painting or a beautiful composition.
1:12:02
In the blending of arts and sciences in the Andrews, that's not the take quite
1:12:09
that they have on it, but that's okay.
1:12:11
I think it's more using the arts as a way of viewing the world that
1:12:18
views from a perspective that's different from our scientific inquiry.
1:12:26
The first application of that or fundamental application which is to have,
1:12:33
especially people who are writers, but also visual artists, come in periodically
1:12:39
to the same place over and over and over again and write pieces from their
1:12:44
own disciplinary perspective over time.
1:12:48
That is an incredibly valuable way of pursuing the world,
1:12:55
of observing the world.
1:12:58
I love it.
1:12:59
I just love it.
1:13:00
I love it that artists and scientists
1:13:05
cohabitate, if you will, at the Andrews and talk with each other and brush elbows
1:13:09
together and they speak to each other.
1:13:13
I don't think we quite yet have a common language.
1:13:17
I think we all have a common ability to perceive the beauty of
1:13:23
the forest and just appreciation of each other for our differences.
1:13:29
But I don't think, for example, that I could show a poet a really
1:13:38
beautiful scientific proof and get that person to sense the beauty
1:13:42
the way that I sense that beauty.
1:13:44
I wish it was possible to do that.
1:13:46
I don't think right now it is.
1:13:47
Maybe that's an evolutionary process in people that we'll get to eventually.
1:13:53
Likewise, I don't think I can quite grasp some of the beauty of
1:13:58
the poetry the way the poet can.
1:14:01
I can appreciate it.
1:14:03
But I don't think I quite grasp the really deep beauty.
1:14:07
Nevertheless, I trust it's exactly that same internal feeling that
1:14:11
just goes oh, that's so gorgeous.
1:14:17
That's awesome.
1:14:18
It's kind of, too, just like you say that they're both similar in the sense
1:14:22
that you're taking the world in and then experience it and interpreting it
1:14:28
and then producing a product, right?
1:14:31
Yes.
1:14:32
Yes.
1:14:32
Yes.
1:14:33
Yes.
1:14:35
They're both, and I think in both worlds we have this very human sense
1:14:41
that what I call the aha discovery moment that in any kind of discipline,
1:14:48
and it's a very personal sense.
1:14:50
I'm sure a brain scientist could say, well that's your endorphins
1:14:53
just going crazy in your brain.
1:14:54
But we hit something in our discipline that makes that little explosion of
1:15:02
those brain chemicals go and it just feels so good because we see something
1:15:08
that's different than what we saw before.
1:15:11
That is, you asked about motivations, that's a huge motivator in science that
1:15:16
you get that, to draw another analogy-long distance runners run because those
1:15:22
endorphins come in and they love that.
1:15:25
I think scientists get those moments where they get this like wow!
1:15:33
This works!
1:15:34
It feels so good!
1:15:39
That's awesome.
1:15:41
Okay, so then, from here, I want to transition into the next section
1:15:45
in which there's going to be quite a bit of overlap, but the
1:15:49
focus will be more towards the community level at the Andrews.
1:15:56
Yes.
1:15:56
That's good and so I want to share a disclaimer at the beginning of this that
1:16:02
I have a brain impediment with names.
1:16:08
When we get to the point of community and names of people, and this is not
1:16:13
just being older, but it's partially that, even when I was the lead PI
1:16:19
of the Andrews, I was working with an assistant who's still there.
1:16:22
She's amazing: Lina DiGregorio.
1:16:24
I don't know if you've met her.
1:16:26
She learned whenever we got around people to be my break and always say,
1:16:34
so-and-so it's so good to see you!
1:16:36
Because I just don't remember names of people.
1:16:40
I'll do the best I can.
1:16:42
Sounds good.
1:16:48
Alrighty.
1:16:48
What role does natural history play in the Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:17:01
I'm not a natural historian myself.
1:17:04
I can't imagine functioning in a community like the Andrews without a
1:17:10
lot of really good natural historians.
1:17:15
We rely on them for the basic observations of the world that a lot of
1:17:25
experimental scientists can be so caught up with their own little stuff they're
1:17:30
working on they don't necessarily see.
1:17:33
In my case, I have not gravitated to the natural history in part because I
1:17:39
just don't remember names of things.
1:17:41
I can, oh yeah, there's the that over there, but a natural
1:17:45
historian typically names things.
1:17:49
Just by naming you remember what's where and the naming of things, I
1:17:56
think we all know that from primitive cultures, is massively important in
1:18:02
getting a connection with things.
1:18:09
Darwin was a natural historian and through his just massive observations
1:18:14
and naming things came up with a lot.
1:18:17
He kind of spanned across a lot of ways of thinking,
1:18:22
but natural history just as applied science, just as the arts are an
1:18:29
important part of the community.
1:18:31
You can't have that solid community without those different components.
1:18:38
I like that point too that you made in that in the process of naming
1:18:42
things we become acquainted with it and then we establish fluency with it.
1:18:46
Yes, and so the natural historian then can introduce me as a non-natural historian
1:18:52
here let me introduce you to so-and-so.
1:18:54
Hi, so-and-so, nice to meet you.
1:18:57
I wouldn't necessarily meet so-and-so and name so-and-so on my own.
1:19:02
What
1:19:05
about observational approaches?
1:19:07
What role do they play at the Andrews Experimental Forest?
1:19:12
What do they offer?
1:19:14
You're right.
1:19:15
This is kind of ground we've sort of already covered.
1:19:20
We can't formulate those really good experimental questions without
1:19:28
a lot of observational background
1:19:34
that brings strength to the question.
1:19:38
Otherwise, they're flimsy questions.
1:19:40
You got to have them.
1:19:44
That's fundamental to Andrews more than most kinds of research because it is
1:19:51
set up to be observational over time.
1:19:56
That's also, I think, one of the biggest tensions of work like the Andrews.
1:20:03
So much money is going into those observations.
1:20:06
It really does come down to economics.
1:20:09
At what point, what is the best balance between putting
1:20:13
your resources into continuous observations versus doing, answering
1:20:21
questions with those observations?
1:20:24
I don't have a good answer for that, but I want to share with you, because it came
1:20:27
to me while I read your questions, one of the mistakes I made as a PI that I am most
1:20:38
unhappy with myself about.
1:20:40
That is that when I was coming up with a budget for LTER-6, we called it, I
1:20:46
ended up not funding an observational line of research involving insects.
1:20:54
We just couldn't afford to do that with some of the other
1:20:58
cool things we wanted to do.
1:21:00
I let that go and I let the researcher who had been doing that
1:21:05
stop those and that work involved just observations at the same place,
1:21:11
going back monitoring what insects were there, how they were changing.
1:21:17
Then, about 3 years ago, there was this awareness that started to grow,
1:21:21
maybe a little more, that worldwide we are having a massive population
1:21:26
crash in insects all over the world.
1:21:31
That's exactly what the Andrews is designed to be able to look at.
1:21:36
Is that happening here?
1:21:38
Are we seeing a crash in insect species here?
1:21:42
I contacted the guy who had been doing that research, and I
1:21:45
said, you know, I think you have a perfect NSF proposal here.
1:21:48
You could probably get a whole lot of money to explore whether
1:21:52
or not this global crash in insect species is happening here.
1:21:57
He said, "Yeah, but you cut off my funding." It's true.
1:22:00
I did.
1:22:01
I did.
1:22:02
I feel so bad about that.
1:22:07
That just is in illustration of that conflict between, if you put all
1:22:10
your eggs in the observational side, you're not doing the experimental
1:22:14
side and answering questions.
1:22:16
You need a balance and that balance itself is dynamic, and I didn't do it
1:22:21
perfectly and I don't think anybody does.
1:22:24
I don't think, you know, looking toward the future what that balance is.
1:22:28
Right.
1:22:30
That's interesting.
1:22:31
Thank you for sharing that story.
1:22:35
Then, what has hypothesis-driven, and experimental research
1:22:40
offered to the Andrews Forest?
1:22:45
Right up there is one of the components that you need to have.
1:22:54
Again, that's my orientation and my bias without a group to just
1:23:00
kind of drive things only that way.
1:23:07
I'll share with you an experience I had as a reviewer of LTER proposals.
1:23:13
This is probably a decade ago.
1:23:14
I was one of the people that was selected by the National Science
1:23:19
Foundation to read proposals by other LTER programs and decide who should
1:23:24
be funded and who shouldn't and why.
1:23:27
About half of us as reviewers were LTER scientists.
1:23:30
The other half were people who were ecologists doing other kinds of research.
1:23:35
One of those other people was a very well-known woman ecologist,
1:23:43
excellent work.
1:23:45
She said, of course, we all know money is really hard to get in science and she said
1:23:55
why should we be funding research in LTERs that isn't as good and doesn't
1:24:02
pose as exciting questions as other researchers are doing outside of the LTER?
1:24:09
We should not be maintaining LTER just because it's always been
1:24:13
there and continue it, because they've got these measurements.
1:24:17
LTER scientists need to justify each time they do a proposal why this is important.
1:24:23
Well, some LTER scientists say it's important because some day this legacy of
1:24:29
information is going to be really useful.
1:24:31
That's very dissatisfying to experimentalists who are competing
1:24:35
for that same pot of money.
1:24:40
Again, I don't have an answer of what the right balance is.
1:24:43
But I know that an LTER group that only does measurements just in case
1:24:51
this is going to be useful for the future is not meeting its obligation,
1:24:57
one that just took all of its budget to do experimental science and gave
1:25:02
up that legacy and that ongoing measurements wouldn't be useful either.
1:25:09
The really hard thing as the lead PI is to do both, is to find some theme,
1:25:17
some way of justifying your continuing just measurement for measurement's
1:25:23
sake, and yet pose some overlying, overarching experimental question on top
1:25:29
of that that in the next 6 years, yes, we are going to do experimental work.
1:25:34
The justification for the ongoing measurements is not just for this
1:25:39
6 years of experimental work.
1:25:41
It's for the future.
1:25:42
But if we don't use it in the here and now, we're not living up to our
1:25:47
obligation to our fellow scientists to do good science in the here and now.
1:25:55
It's just really the same answer I've given to everything else: yeah, we
1:25:58
need it all, but maybe with a few examples of why it's all important.
1:26:03
And putting it in context as well.
1:26:06
So, one that we haven't talked much about but it's the last question in
1:26:12
this section, is both ecosystem modeling and modeling in general.
1:26:15
What are your thoughts on modeling and has modeling contributed to the
1:26:19
Andrews Experimental Forest and to ecology in general and if so, how?
1:26:24
Right.
1:26:29
Well, let me just start by saying I perceive, and this is artificial
1:26:33
as a separation, but there are two fundamentally different kinds of modeling.
1:26:37
One is something I lean to more, which is more process-level
1:26:43
modeling which is a model that takes individual little components
1:26:51
of a larger process and puts them together into something that attempts
1:26:57
to simulate the underlying forces and processes that go on in a phenomenon.
1:27:04
The other is a type of modeling that takes a lot of measurements of
1:27:12
historical change in many different places and attempts to recapitulate that.
1:27:22
A classic example would be growth and yield curves for forest productivity and
1:27:29
to say in this kind of site with this kind of climate here is the change in
1:27:33
productivity that we expect with this kind of tree based on past measurements,
1:27:37
but there's no process involved.
1:27:39
It's just putting together lots and lots and lots of observations into this is
1:27:47
what's normal and here are the statistical boundaries around what we observe.
1:27:53
It's observation versus experimental.
1:27:56
My own experience is with the process-level modeling far more, so that's
1:28:04
what I'm going to restrict this to, and I think that process-level modeling has
1:28:11
been probably, well, that's going out on a limb here, but probably more important
1:28:17
than any other approach we have taken in ecology in the past couple of decades.
1:28:25
It's just unbelievably important to do that because it is only through
1:28:34
process level ecology that we can
1:28:39
predict what might happen in the future with change and we can't do an experiment
1:28:44
on the kind of scale we'd like it.
1:28:46
People do experiments of testing, say, like a tree or a few trees and adding
1:28:52
CO2 or changing the temperature and saying what are you going to do to trees.
1:28:56
That's absolutely fundamentally different than what happens over a biome or even
1:29:02
on a global level, if things change.
1:29:05
We can't do that experiment and the only way to do those experiments
1:29:09
is through process models.
1:29:13
I think my own field of physiological ecology is one of the very best examples
1:29:17
of how models have transformed thinking.
1:29:21
Very, very best physiological ecologists that I knew when I started
1:29:27
would be the folks at Stanford:
1:29:32
Hal Mooney and a few others that were studying
1:29:38
especially desert plants initially and how do they work and how do they function?
1:29:42
As that group at Stanford moved from the '80s maybe into the '90s, and
1:29:50
then certainly into the next decade, they started to take the little
1:29:53
processes that they understood from individual plants and scaled up.
1:29:59
Now most of those graduate students that had studied with those people
1:30:05
are doing global models using a lot of the same fundamental processes that we
1:30:10
thought we understood from the 1980s, and they are part of the many, many,
1:30:16
many teams across the world who are trying to predict what happens under
1:30:21
different scenarios of climate change.
1:30:23
Is this as usual?
1:30:24
Or CO2 changing by this much or temperature changing by that much?
1:30:29
It's gotten way more complex because oceanographic scientists and atmospheric
1:30:34
scientists and others have gotten involved, but I can't think of anything
1:30:40
that's happened in ecosystem ecology that's more important than that
1:30:46
change to be able to predict what's happening and it's only through models.
1:30:53
What we've learned is that no model is right.
1:30:56
Everyone is wrong, but you can start to achieve some consensus by doing
1:31:05
multiple modeling and see what 15 different models predict and then
1:31:10
you take the average of those and make a model so that the way that the
1:31:14
thinking is going is truly amazing.
1:31:14
It's
1:31:19
out of my grasp.
1:31:19
I don't do that sort of thing, but I think it is more important
1:31:24
than anything else we're doing.
1:31:29
Pardon me, because I don't have much knowledge of this topic myself,
1:31:32
but I'm just curious, with the historical modeling you said a lot of
1:31:35
that is propped up by observational data, right, and historical data?
1:31:42
What goes into the process of developing a process-level modeling
1:31:47
in simple terms, if you can?
1:31:50
Yeah.
1:31:51
That's a really good question.
1:31:54
In answering that I will tell you that I learned more about physiology of plants
1:32:01
by reading the code that someone else had written for a process-level model of how
1:32:06
a tree goes and assimilates carbon and uses water than I ever did any other way.
1:32:13
It was one of those aha moments.
1:32:15
Oh, my God, it really is all connected, and this is how it works!
1:32:19
This is so cool!
1:32:21
Of course, all of the little pieces were wrong.
1:32:24
Your question wasn't quite that.
1:32:26
It was how do you go about it.
1:32:28
I think you start to go about it based on the little bits that you know and
1:32:33
some of the first physiological models that I know, and this would be, so one
1:32:38
of Dick's students, Steve-I told you I don't do names, Steve [Running] at
1:32:45
Montana who has retired recently, started
1:32:51
at the same level of thinking that I would start at of this is how photosynthesis
1:32:57
works under these temperatures and this amount of light and we can predict for
1:33:01
each leaf how much carbon it brings in.
1:33:06
You have this little set of codes: here's the temperature.
1:33:10
Here's the light capture.
1:33:11
Here's the sunlight.
1:33:13
Here's the sun angle.
1:33:15
You produce carbon.
1:33:18
Then you need something, okay, how is carbon distributed within that tree?
1:33:22
Then you need to have somebody else's experiment, and these process-level
1:33:28
modelers are reading experimentalist's papers to understand what are the
1:33:34
fluxes of carbon and what governs them.
1:33:37
Then you put that in.
1:33:39
Somebody else is, yeah, but this leaf is not receiving the same light as that leaf,
1:33:44
and then there's a whole other discipline of how the physical characteristic of
1:33:51
leaf display within a tree affects the shading and the partial shading and then
1:33:56
you realize, but, no, this model's now getting too complex because we can't
1:34:00
model every single individual leaf.
1:34:03
You start to say, well, on average, then there's...and it's just this trial
1:34:12
and error of bringing in these little components that are always wrong,
1:34:18
always an approximation to what the real world is doing that started out
1:34:23
really, really simple back probably in the 1970s or so, and ultimately got
1:34:29
more and more complex of bringing in, well, let's not just look at individual
1:34:33
trees, let's look at the whole forest.
1:34:35
Because what this tree does isn't nearly as important.
1:34:40
A lot of people started worrying about light distribution through a
1:34:43
canopy and how individual trees will die as they grow and get shaded.
1:34:49
Then the biogeochemistry starts to come in.
1:34:52
Yeah, but, when the leaves fall, how do they decompose and what's the
1:34:57
timespan of that and what are the moisture requirements or whatever else.
1:35:03
Biogeochemistry really early got built into some of those process level models.
1:35:08
As people started thinking more globally, they started thinking
1:35:11
about atmospheric processes of,
1:35:17
oh, just say, like if a forest is cut 20 miles away, this is an
1:35:22
over-simple example, it's going to affect the way clouds are
1:35:26
bringing moisture to this forest.
1:35:30
There's more moisture that's coming here if it's not falling over there.
1:35:35
The atmosphere component starts bringing in.
1:35:37
That's why the modeling becomes ultimately, in many cases, so
1:35:44
multidisciplinary, and it's always wrong.
1:35:48
It's always an approximation.
1:35:50
But it's always getting better.
1:35:54
The model itself is dependent on a process of trying to tweak.
1:36:00
Yeah, the model is a way, well, the ones I like, are ways of putting
1:36:06
together understandings of multiple disciplines into a simulated whole
1:36:14
that nobody can do on their own.
1:36:19
Great.
1:36:21
I have just a couple of concluding questions.
1:36:25
Okay.
1:36:28
What significant ideas have emerged from the Andrews science community and
1:36:32
how did these science ideas evolve in terms of both questions and methods?
1:36:37
Yeah.
1:36:41
I think that most of the really significant [ideas] that came out of the
1:36:45
Andrews preceded my joining that group.
1:36:50
There's a lot of really good stuff that goes on right now,
1:36:52
but the really fundamental
1:36:56
understanding of structure and function of old-growth forests, of how watersheds
1:37:01
work, of understanding some of the early experiments, even before the LTER program,
1:37:08
of harvesting trees in watersheds and seeing how the watershed responded,
1:37:15
both in terms of the chemistry as well as the water and the temperature, so
1:37:22
that, in addition to understanding how watersheds work, it set a precedent for
1:37:28
watershed-scale research that wasn't only at the Andrews, but the Andrews was one of
1:37:34
the very first places where, and Hubbard Brook as well, where that kind of scale
1:37:41
of ecological thinking started to go on.
1:37:45
The IBP [International Biological Program] , the contribution, again before
1:37:51
the LTER program, the thinking about how different biomes come to be and where they
1:38:00
are and how they function differently.
1:38:03
It's huge.
1:38:03
It's just huge and we just accept it now as dogma.
1:38:09
It's just huge what that group did.
1:38:14
Obviously, the spotted owl and other organisms that, and functions,
1:38:20
that are part of old growth.
1:38:25
I don't think anybody had an idea that different developmental stages of forest
1:38:31
were so important to animals before then.
1:38:35
The fundamental biology is just how the growth stage of the forest and
1:38:41
the biota within it go together.
1:38:44
The implications to forest management are unbelievably huge, as well as
1:38:50
cultural perceptions about science.
1:38:53
I'm sure you're into that.
1:39:00
I'm sure lots and lots of other people have shared with you extraordinarily
1:39:05
important things that came out of the Andrews at that time.
1:39:08
I came to the Andrews in the late '90s and became lead PI in the early 2000s.
1:39:17
I would say
1:39:20
that the true breakthrough wow research during my time and
1:39:28
subsequently in ecosystems hasn't approached what it was then.
1:39:36
What has happened at the Andrews is more setting a precedent for, again, this
1:39:45
multidisciplinary conversation that I don't believe has quite
1:39:49
produced the aha moment yet.
1:39:52
I'd like to trust that it will.
1:39:56
The blending of the arts and the scientists I'd like to trust that it will.
1:39:59
I think that all that is happening now - maybe like Darwin going out
1:40:04
and looking at the different animals in the Galapagos and noticing
1:40:08
their similarities and differences.
1:40:10
It's observational, and the real product of that, I hope, is yet to come.
1:40:18
Time will tell.
1:40:22
Great.
1:40:25
My final question is what do you see as the main principles and motivating forces
1:40:31
that drive the Andrews as a community?
1:40:35
That drives science in general?
1:40:36
Let me see how you actually wrote them.
1:40:46
Yeah, I didn't attempt to take notes on that because they're not always pretty.
1:40:54
Scientists in general are driven by a pretty 50-50 combination
1:41:01
of money and opportunity versus basic desire for inquiry.
1:41:07
What keeps the Andrews going as a community without a doubt is the fact
1:41:13
that there's money there as long as the National Science Foundation supports
1:41:19
with money and even more so as long as Oregon State University and U of
1:41:26
O and other institutions give atta boy, atta girl [verbal support] for
1:41:31
participating people will be there.
1:41:35
I think that's huge.
1:41:38
That's at least half of it.
1:41:39
I think a lot of people love, love, love, love, as I did, the chance to have
1:41:46
conversations like you and I are having, although I think our conversation is
1:41:50
even better, but the monthly meetings at the Andrews Forest are analogous to what
1:41:58
any academic department does of having seminars, but they're very different
1:42:03
because they're drawing people from all over campus who do different things.
1:42:08
We share different perspectives.
1:42:10
If you like that diversity, and a lot of us do, it's a really
1:42:15
lovely thing to be involved with.
1:42:18
It just feels good.
1:42:21
Right.
1:42:22
Thank you.
1:42:24
I think there was something else that I wanted to share
1:42:26
that I wanted to get back with.
1:42:28
We talked about briefly about scientific questions, about
1:42:32
coming up with good questions.
1:42:37
I didn't explore that completely the way I wanted to with you, which is my sense that
1:42:46
it's like the adage it takes a community to raise a child.
1:42:49
It also takes a community to help refine really good questions.
1:42:55
The way I approached science for most of my career, I had this notion
1:43:01
of what I call back pocket ideas.
1:43:04
I very rarely would
1:43:09
pursue a scientific question or even write a proposal until it sat in my
1:43:13
back pocket and aged for a while.
1:43:16
By aging, that means that periodically I'd pull out that question, when
1:43:23
I'm especially in a group of other people that I really trust
1:43:26
and love and love talking to.
1:43:28
Most of us as scientists get this community of, I mean it's just a really
1:43:32
feel-good community of folks that we think are really smart and think
1:43:37
differently than we do, and my favorite part of being a scientist was what I
1:43:44
thought of as sitting around a table with other really smart people and pulling
1:43:50
an idea out of my back pocket and say, "Hey guys, I've been pondering this.
1:43:55
What do you think about this?" My group of people were folks I knew that I
1:44:00
could trust and weren't going to steal the idea and take it somewhere else and
1:44:04
we could just sit around, maybe that table was actually a campfire, and we
1:44:10
were passing a bottle of wine around or maybe we were in a meeting somewhere and
1:44:15
having dinner, but it's the same idea.
1:44:19
You're sitting around-it's the best part of science-being able to come to
1:44:24
the table with a bunch of really smart people and having them accept that you
1:44:30
are one of them and you can share your ideas and they help you massage them.
1:44:36
I think it's better than anything.
1:44:41
The good feelings it gives you is unbelievable.
1:44:44
That's
1:44:48
great.
1:44:48
Thank you so much.
1:44:50
Before we conclude, are there any other final thoughts
1:44:54
that you want to contribute?
1:44:56
I know I'm going to think of a bunch of them after we close.
1:44:59
But I really want to hear your story.
1:45:01
Alright, so let's
1:45:09
see here.
1:45:09
I'm going to finish that.
1:45:10
Let's see here.
1:45:10
