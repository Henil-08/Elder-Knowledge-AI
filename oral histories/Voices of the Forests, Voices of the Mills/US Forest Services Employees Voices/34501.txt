00:01
This is a tape of the interview with Mike Kerrick, which took place
00:04
on August 28th at Mr. Kerrick’s home in Springfield, Oregon.
00:11
Today is the 28th of August, 1996.
00:15
This is for the Andrews history project.
00:24
Anything that you wanted to get started with?
00:27
To begin with, I think we’re just going to talk a little bit about your background,
00:32
and how you came to be involved working at the Andrews and working with people at
00:39
the Andrews.
00:40
I came here in
00:46
1955, and was ranger on the McKenzie [Ranger] District,
00:49
which was on the McKenzie [River]
00:55
. It wasn’t called the Andrews then.
00:57
It was Blue River Experimental Forest back then.
01:00
The name change occurred in 1953 [Blue River
01:09
EF, 1948-53; H.J. Andrews EF, 1953-Present]
01:18
. You know, it was named after H.J. Andrews, when he was killed in Washington, D.C.?
01:27
That was in 1951?
01:27
1951.
01:27
That was ‘Hoss’ Andrews.
01:27
Yeah.
01:27
[Horace J. “Hoss” Andrews]
01:28
H.J.
01:38
Andrews.
01:41
I came down here in ’55,
01:45
yeah, that’s when it was.
01:46
It was the McKenzie Bridge District, then in ’56, the
01:52
Blue River District was formed, and the Andrews was all on my
01:58
end [Within Blue River District, Willamette National Forest]
02:04
. Hmm.
02:06
There was no housing, no building, no nothing
02:15
there [H.J. Andrews E.F. territory]
02:17
. Were any roads in place at that time?
02:19
Oh yes, they were up in there.
02:23
As I recall,
02:28
you had so much of “the cut” on the forest, we had to “get the cut out,” and
02:35
I talked to the guys from the station [PNW] about why we sold so much timber
02:39
then, and then, Jack Rothacher came on.
02:44
He
02:56
left the station in 1956, I think it was, and rented a house by the district
03:03
headquarters [in town of Blue River]
03:05
. Right.
03:05
He was my next-door neighbor there.
03:07
Yeah.
03:11
He was the only person who lived there as
03:20
a resident at the time.
03:22
He carried on with watersheds research.
03:28
[Basis of data gathering/studies at HJA, carried on today in LTER context.]
03:31
So, he was the only person that was living on the forest, it sounds like?
03:34
Yeah, he, Jerry Dunford,
03:37
and Jerry Franklin.
03:40
Yeah, but they stayed in trailers.
03:44
They lived
03:47
up at the
03:48
-- -- Up at the trailer park [Near Blue River Ranger District Headquarters]
03:49
. No,
03:53
they lived in Corvallis.
03:59
Well, they may have commuted in those early days.
04:04
I can’t remember, either.
04:06
Nobody lived up there then.
04:07
But Jack was the only resident researcher on site in ’56.
04:13
We did everything in contact with Jack then.
04:19
How did the experimental forest fit into your overall management
04:23
plans for the Blue River?
04:29
We managed it and laid out a whole plan for them.
04:33
We laid out timber sales according to his [Roy Silen – first USFS person
04:38
on experimental forest] design.
04:38
We were part of that.
04:41
We laid out sales.
04:50
We did some things.
05:02
We put
05:12
50-foot fire lines, pretty
05:17
much outside of the Andrews.
05:18
Had some operational things.
05:21
Yeah, laid out sales.
05:21
Jay Gashwiler?
05:21
Gashwiler, yeah,
05:27
Jay Gashwiler, right.
05:29
He was in wildlife management.
05:32
Particularly, a mouser.
05:34
A wild-lifer, yeah.
05:37
A “mice
05:45
guy,” right?
05:46
He was a mice guy.
05:48
I
05:50
looked one day,
05:53
he’d been talking to the mice, and
05:58
he was on a first-name basis with all the mice.
06:00
I mean, he’d catch the same mouse 3 or 4 or 5 times, in the same traps.
06:06
[Chuckles]
06:08
Yeah.
06:09
And then he travelled on.
06:10
Yeah.
06:16
Do you know where Gashwiler is?
06:17
Have you heard the name?
06:18
Yeah, I’ve heard the name quite a bit.
06:19
I haven’t talked to him yet.
06:20
Yeah, yeah.
06:22
Another guy, Jerry Dunford.
06:24
Who?
06:24
Jerry Dunford?
06:25
[USFS hydrologist]
06:26
That name, I don’t think has come up.
06:27
He was there,
06:31
and George Meagher [USFS forester] . George was a timber beast, though.
06:34
George Meagher.
06:36
I don’t remember him.
06:39
We went to an NSF meeting one time, me
06:45
and Jerry Dunford, Jerry Franklin, too.
06:53
Jerry Franklin, he wasn’t there in 1956.
06:54
Was he?
06:55
When you first came, was he working there already?
06:58
I don’t think so.
06:59
I’m not sure when Jerry arrived [Summer]
07:01
. No, Jerry didn’t know that
07:08
we were there.
07:10
[Laughter].
07:10
He was very ambitious, he was ready to learn.
07:11
No, he wasn’t there yet.
07:14
That’s kind of an interesting angle.
07:16
What was your perception of research in relation to your
07:21
management concerns at that time?
07:23
It all related to timber sales.
07:27
Units were cut all at
07:36
one time, 200 acres at one time.
07:41
George had to cut a watershed.
07:44
Which one, I can’t think of it.
07:48
Do you remember anything about that?
07:51
That was the first watershed, Watershed 1?
07:57
Yeah.
07:58
Watershed 1, and Watershed 2.
07:59
And Watershed 3.
07:59
No, that was done in-between my times there.
08:02
That was when
08:06
you were gone.
08:07
When I was there in ’56, I remember we got a grant from research to build
08:13
a trail down as access to Watershed 2, which was the control watershed.
08:14
And we built that trail down to there.
08:14
Did they ever do any research on that?
08:14
We did a lot of disturbance on that trail.
08:14
Yeah
08:27
[Laughing].
08:29
Well, I don’t know that they ever did.
08:30
Maybe it didn’t hurt anything.
08:31
Yeah.
08:32
Yeah.
08:33
On the third one,
08:40
I guess we built the roads.
08:41
We built the road into Watershed 3.
08:43
Right.
08:44
It was supposed to represent the staggered-setting harvest methods, which
08:49
were developed there in the Andrews.
08:51
I guess they were the policy in the region at that time.
08:53
I guess one or two [timber sales] were 200 acres.
08:55
Watershed 1 is, well, I don’t know what the exact size is,
09:01
but it was all cut at one time.
09:04
They put a machine on top, and a machine on the bottom, alongside it
09:08
[for logging] . And before that, they built quite a lot of flumes [to study
09:11
runoff] . That was rather important.
09:11
We wanted all those set right
09:18
in the middle of the stream, so that you could read anything that you wanted to.
09:25
So, the whole stream was diverted right into the flume,
09:26
is that what you’re saying?
09:26
To read the flow?
09:28
Yeah.
09:30
And there was a sediment pond at the bottom there.
09:35
Actually, those were built in the early ‘50s, I think, and they were
09:41
calibrated several years prior to the treatment process.
09:45
Yeah, I guess so.
09:47
So, they knew what the background was.
09:50
Right.
09:50
And then, the treatment [logging] was done, and they measured the effects.
09:57
I believe
10:01
there was
10:05
no
10:09
ground contact;
10:16
it was all sky-line logging.
10:19
Uh-huh.
10:20
No high-lead.
10:20
Wasn’t Watershed 2 high-lead?
10:20
No.
10:20
2
10:27
was the control watershed.
10:29
There was no harvesting in 2.
10:31
And 3 [watershed] was the staggered setting, and that had a new set of roads.
10:37
From that episode, we learned that this wasn’t a very good place to put roads.
10:41
In the ’64 flood, that whole thing came out.
10:44
It created more problems than Watershed 1 did, even though the
10:47
entire watershed was harvested.
10:47
That was when I was at Malheur [National Forest] , and when you
10:52
were
10:55
gone.
10:57
So, when did you move, in ’60?
10:59
Something like that?
11:00
Yeah, January, the beginning of ’60.
11:03
The beginning of ’60?
11:03
And then I lost track of
11:07
what was going on at the Andrews.
11:08
And then Denver, and Missoula.
11:10
After that, I was getting tired of moving.
11:13
I remember, Ed, you talking about Bob Aufderheide.
11:16
He wasn’t part of the original team that went in there, or was he?
11:18
Yeah.
11:19
Bob Aufderheide and Phil,
11:24
what’s that guy’s name?
11:27
Briegleb?
11:27
Yeah.
11:36
He was an important forester.
11:39
Phil, wasn’t he involved, somehow?
11:43
Bob Aufderheide and that other fellow; they
11:48
were two important guys in that first big sale of one big clear-cut,
11:55
which was completed right there.
11:57
They were interested in what the effect of the clear-cut unit size would be.
11:58
Anyway, we had to logger on there, Bob, he was the major coordinator.
11:58
Yeah, that’s right.
11:58
The clear-cut units were circular.
11:58
They
12:19
were circular, strip, and all kinds of different sizes.
12:23
I
12:28
think they had an eighth-of-an-acre, and everything they had fell out
12:39
of it.
12:39
[Laughter]
12:39
What was driving that kind of research?
12:41
Were there problems you were facing in the forest management arena that
12:46
was encouraging people to do that?
12:48
No.
12:48
They didn’t have anything to do with what research was required.
12:51
I think they were responding to trying to
12:57
develop the best scheme for converting the virgin forests to managed forests.
13:04
I think that was probably driving it.
13:05
[Forest Service was looking at natural Douglas-fir regeneration by seeding
13:06
in relation to cutting-unit size.]
13:06
Uh-huh.
13:06
They would do 50 acres, 50 each in a strip, and about 400 feet wide, cutting
13:06
down the slope, across the slope.
13:06
Nothing in particular happened to them.
13:06
Yeah,
13:25
that was the formula.
13:29
They wanted
13:33
to look at the effects of landslides, measure the velocity, and the
13:38
internal mechanisms of those things.
13:42
You’ve not been up to the sites up there?
13:43
No.
13:44
Actually, I’m going there, taking a tour tomorrow.
13:46
Well,
13:48
one of the issues that very recently happened, in the late ‘80s, early
13:56
‘90s, has been to look at land-flows and the mechanics of
14:01
land-flows, all that sort of stuff.
14:03
A bunch of debris would fall into the water and cause problems for the fish.
14:13
But the strips that you were talking about were
14:18
designed to see how rapid natural regeneration came back in,
14:27
and various orientations north and south and east and west, and various widths.
14:32
And then, those circles were
14:37
where you had different distances to the edge of the opening.
14:37
They were in different locations.
14:39
Yeah,
14:41
they were in different locations in the Andrews.
14:41
That stuff was done way back in the ‘50s.
14:46
You go back there now and there are plants and stuff all over.
14:50
Had there been much problems in
14:53
the Blue River region with landslides, or was it just something that
14:56
was a preventative study to try and identify [potential dangers]
14:56
? Some things came out of it that I didn’t expect.
14:57
For instance, you leave stumps along the side of the road, and in
14:57
about 5 or 6 years the road would collapse because the roots were
15:14
rotting.
15:16
When we were first up on Lookout Creek, there was this
15:29
big stump, I guess, as big as this table.
15:32
So we ask, “Well, what the hell did they do with it?” [Laughter] We did all the
15:36
logging with a logger named Mike Savelich.
15:36
He
15:49
was a pretty good gentleman.
15:53
What was his name?
15:53
Savelich.
15:54
Savelich?
15:55
Yeah, Mike Savelich.
15:58
S-A-V-E-L-I-C-H, I think.
16:01
That’s right.
16:02
Yeah, something like that.
16:03
Savelich.
16:04
He was from Croatia.
16:06
Yeah, Croatia.
16:07
Yeah.
16:07
Andrew Sabo [?] was the sale administrator, and he and Mike
16:14
got along pretty well together.
16:15
Andrew was Croatian too, but he was American-born, but his ancestry was,
16:22
I think, from that neck of the woods.
16:28
Mike would shake his head and wonder how in the world a contract required
16:33
that all trees be felled within the unit, and on some “goofy” sites [for
16:39
experimental research reasons] . Well, sometimes you just couldn’t do that.
16:41
[Laughing] That was always kind of a joke.
16:44
I guess Savelich, over the years, did all the logging up there [Did many
16:51
early sales in the HJA] . He bid for
16:55
the contracts.
16:55
These were part of those contracts and he had to things that couldn’t be required
16:59
outside [the experimental forest] . And the logging all had to be downhill.
17:07
And he
17:12
didn’t want, some
17:19
of them, didn’t want skylines.
17:20
In the end, it looked pretty good.
17:22
Timing was also critical for research.
17:24
I remember that was always a problem.
17:26
The time it was cut, you mean?
17:28
Yeah, the researchers wanted it done boom, boom, boom, and right, because
17:31
they had everything all set up.
17:33
But for most loggers, the world doesn’t work that way, with markets
17:40
and all those kinds of things.
17:41
No, it doesn’t work like that.
17:42
Sometimes it had 60 to 70 percent side-slope, and you can’t do that with
17:48
trees, as it doesn’t grow right away.
17:49
Uh-huh.
17:49
We did the best we could.
17:51
Yeah.
17:52
So, it sounds like the bid on it was not necessarily just a low bid, but
17:55
that someone that would be able to work with the constraints imposed.
17:58
Yeah, I’m not sure how that happened.
17:59
I forget how many
18:04
times it worked that way.
18:04
It sounds like this guy Savelich kind of got used to the requirements, as far as
18:08
research requirements, and worked well with the researchers in the Andrews.
18:10
Right, right.
18:11
He had a bunch of
18:18
Croatians that just couldn’t speak the English language, so Mike hired all
18:20
those and put them to work out there.
18:24
Yeah?
18:25
And he would just as soon have
18:29
a steep slope with a 60-70 foot culvert, as he’d put in a 30-foot [culvert] . And
18:36
when they did, he had to change them all.
18:37
He did a beautiful job.
18:38
Just as good as could be.
18:43
He was
18:50
a logger, so you had to tell him what you wanted,
18:55
as he wasn’t going to
19:04
do it himself.
19:05
Once Mike had to do that, let’s put it this way, when he wasn’t
19:08
there, they [his crew] wouldn’t do it, but when the boss was there, he
19:12
got in there and hollered at them.
19:12
Yeah,
19:15
Balsiger [first name?] , he was a different kind of a logger.
19:19
He did it his way.
19:22
He was a tough one to deal with, was my recollection, anyway.
19:25
Yeah.
19:27
Savelich used mostly Croatians.
19:30
Were these people his crew?
19:30
Were they people that he brought in from outside this area, or people
19:33
that were living around there.
19:35
Well, I think he found some of them
19:38
in town.
19:39
I don’t know.
19:40
Seemed he didn’t know anybody around
19:50
there, but he was industrious.
19:55
The second person you mentioned, the other logger, you said
19:58
you had more difficulty with.
19:59
Balsiger.
20:00
Balsiger, yeah.
20:01
It sounds like he wasn’t hiring Croatians, but he was hiring
20:05
mostly people from around there?
20:05
No, no.
20:06
He was a promoter.
20:07
He was also the guy that logged Watershed 1, maybe with the Wyssen
20:12
system [European “skyline” system used at the HJA and elsewhere in Oregon/U.S.]
20:12
. Yeah, Wyssen seems right.
20:16
Yeah.
20:17
Yeah.
20:18
It took a long time to log that.
20:21
I wasn’t there when.
20:22
I wasn’t there either.
20:23
I
20:25
came back into this country in ’77.
20:31
Nobody knew me.
20:33
[Chuckles]
20:33
He was retired by then.
20:43
Let’s see,
20:48
the logging was getting out
20:59
towards Wolf Rock.
21:00
That’s far off the Andrews.
21:03
Well,
21:05
yeah.
21:05
Wolf Rock is outside the Andrews.
21:07
Right.
21:08
I thought I heard “Carpenter” in there, but you said Wolf.
21:12
Well, you could get a good view out there in the neighborhood
21:12
of Carpenter [Mountain]
21:13
. Yeah, you can.
21:21
I rode up there on a horse one time.
21:24
You said you rode up on a horse?
21:25
To Carpenter Mountain, yeah.
21:26
Oh, I see.
21:28
Back to Aufderheide.
21:29
I think he was part of the original team that rode into that country and
21:34
rode the boundaries [of experimental forest] . I forget what Bob was doing.
21:40
He was in research at the time, wasn’t he, on the Umpqua [National Forest]
21:45
? This was before he was supervisor here.
21:52
Yeah he was.
21:53
I worked for Bob on the Siuslaw [National Forest] when he was assistant supervisor.
21:56
That was what they called him then.
21:59
He was there,
22:02
and then,
22:07
down on the Umpqua later.
22:10
That was my understanding; that he was down on the Umpqua.
22:14
Anyhow, he wasn’t here
22:19
very long.
22:20
Yeah.
22:20
From ’55 to, he died in ’59, I think.
22:25
Yeah.
22:26
Early ’59.
22:28
Because Dave Jessup came after
22:36
he died.
22:37
Well, that’s longer than I thought.
22:41
Yeah.
22:44
After Aufderheide was there, he and, dang it, remember that fellow by the name
22:58
of
22:58
-- ? Not Roy Silen?
23:02
-- Roy Silen.
23:02
Roy Silen.
23:03
Yeah.
23:04
Oh, was that Roy Silen?
23:04
Yeah.
23:04
He and Bob worked real closely.
23:05
Roy Silen was down there
23:05
[-] . Yeah.
23:17
Roy was one of the principal investigators or researchers in the early ‘50s.
23:26
I was trying to remember.
23:26
I think he said he was there from ’48 to ’54, something like that.
23:29
Oh, really?
23:30
Maybe ’56, I can’t remember.
23:32
Yeah.
23:33
Well, he showed up here, and
23:36
-- -- He what?
23:36
He’d show up here, and he sure
23:40
did a lot.
23:40
Yeah,
23:45
he laid out the roads, and the design, I guess.
23:50
The notion was that they had two different ways of roading the drainage.
23:57
One was a “ladder” design, and the other, I don’t know.
24:04
It didn’t fit the ground.
24:05
What?
24:05
It didn’t fit the ground.
24:05
Yeah.
24:05
That’s right.
24:05
It didn’t fit the ground very well.
24:06
[Laughing]
24:06
They were trying to get a good fit with the ground?
24:10
The basic question was, what was the most efficient way to road and convert
24:15
these virgin, old-growth stands,
24:19
into a managed forest?
24:22
That was the basic objective in the early ‘50s, and that was also the period when
24:30
the national forests followed getting
24:34
into harvesting in a big way.
24:37
They’d been harvesting timber for a long time, but not in a very big way.
24:42
But, during the war, and especially following the war,
24:48
most of the national forests in the west, at least in western Oregon, were
24:54
beginning to really move into development.
24:56
That’s what this research really was kind of geared for.
24:59
How you can manage old growth,
25:04
I think, the first fifty years of old growth.
25:11
So, figuring out a road system and access to the forest, those
25:17
kinds of things were important?
25:19
Silviculture, regeneration, all the various effects of operations on soil
25:25
compaction and erosion; those things were part of this research design, to try
25:32
to determine the effects of management, and to try to help managers do a
25:37
better job of managing those resources.
25:42
That recycles my notion.
25:44
That’s right.
25:46
Along the way, there was always tension between researchers who were inclined
25:52
to have some wild ideas, and the managers who had to live with them, and
25:56
tried to put that thing into motion.
26:00
But, I think that was a creative tension that we had.
26:03
So, you’re saying that one of the road systems didn’t fit the land, somehow?
26:07
Was that the ladder system?
26:08
Yeah, in steep canyons like in the Andrews, it didn’t fit.
26:12
It might have worked in flatter terrain, but
26:17
in the Andrews, it didn’t fit.
26:19
What fit the Andrews was to try to stay on the lay of the land, to
26:24
put the least impact on the land.
26:27
Not just the Andrews, they’d do it over here.
26:30
Yeah,
26:33
it was pretty typical of western Oregon.
26:36
It still is.
26:38
One of the other questions we had was a problem with slash.
26:40
There was a terrific amount of slash, and we’d try and drag it in, and we would
26:41
burn a side, and all the wood in the sale.
26:42
Yeah, maintain the roads, protect from fire, all that sort of
26:45
stuff.
26:45
There was a tremendous amount of slash,
26:57
so
27:32
there was a disposal problem, then?
27:34
Oh, yes.
27:34
In ’54, they were taking eleven or
27:44
twelve inches down, the tops, and now they’re taking down it to three [inches]
27:45
, and we’d go a couple inches below that.
27:45
We were getting down to six-inch tops, but
27:56
there was
28:07
still an awful lot of slash.
28:09
Today,
28:14
they
28:17
take every damn
28:21
inch into the chipper.
28:22
But we would top it then.
28:23
What was the role
28:32
of private foresters in that period in
28:40
thwarting or encouraging certain kinds of research?
28:43
What was the National Forest system doing in relation to private forestry in Oregon?
28:51
Discouraging research?
28:54
Well, no.
28:55
Were they promoting it or were they encouraging it, asking for
28:59
particular kinds of research to be done, or was it somehow something
29:01
different by the Forest Service?
29:03
No,
29:06
we were
29:09
a long way ahead of them.
29:11
We had some ideas.
29:13
I remember that Savelich wouldn’t do it.
29:14
We
29:17
asked him
29:21
when he started, as we went down
29:26
and in the first
29:30
timber sale to 6-inch tops, and
29:35
they didn’t object to it either.
29:37
The loggers didn’t object?
29:41
No.
29:41
We were encouraged.
29:42
We
29:45
wanted to get in there with our sales.
29:58
Well, we had arguments with some environmentalists.
30:01
They wanted all the snags left.
30:01
This was in the ‘50s?
30:01
Yeah.
30:16
Really?
30:19
They wanted what left?
30:21
All the snags left.
30:21
Really?
30:22
I’ll be darned.
30:23
I have a weird sense of humor, [laughing] and I had this university doctor, Onthank.
30:24
Onthank, yeah.
30:27
Onthank?
30:41
Onthank.
30:42
Carl Onthank [Early environmental activist in region]
30:43
. He was outside the Forest Service.
30:47
Yeah, he was a University of Oregon prof., I think [U.O. Law School]
30:49
. Yeah, this
30:54
Onthank was quite a bird.
31:05
“You cut this snag down, and where will the woodpeckers live?” And I got mad,
31:08
as I had to make a lot of decisions.
31:13
All the other woodpeckers,
31:22
you know, could go to another tree.
31:22
[Laughter]
31:22
Yeah, there was always a contingent of environmental folks.
31:27
They’re following you around all the time.
31:28
Yeah, yeah.
31:29
So these people were based in Eugene, it sounds like.
31:33
I went to talk at the high school,
31:37
and the doctor,
31:44
who was it?
31:44
I forget.
31:45
The thing is that these
31:52
people would
32:01
tell you things that were
32:09
bald lies, just outright lies.
32:09
These things that I could tell.
32:09
That’s something I want to get into a little bit.
32:11
What is your perception of how local residents in the valley perceived
32:16
the purpose of the research forest?
32:18
Or, did they even realize that it was there?
32:21
What was the interaction between management of that
32:24
forest and local communities?
32:26
In the ‘50s?
32:27
Yeah.
32:27
The ‘50’s and ‘60s, over that period.
32:32
Well, there was no one who would check in
32:39
on you.
32:40
And, that whole time
33:01
they say the Forest Service is thought so well of by the public, who thought,
33:05
if they tell it to me, I believe it.
33:08
I hope they didn’t tell me any falsehoods.
33:12
As far as the H.J. Andrews Forest, I don’t if there was a lot of
33:17
involvement there, necessarily.
33:18
No,
33:21
I was only there once a year, anyway.
33:26
I was commenting about that woodpecker guy, and you know, I just laughed at him.
33:31
He
33:35
wanted a
33:38
row of snags along
33:42
the ridges.
33:44
He wanted to leave it, he wanted to have it.
33:50
It sounds like you were involved in some outreach programs at the
33:55
high schools, and going around up there and talking to people?
33:58
Yeah.
34:01
We had trees all over that were planted by high schoolers.
34:06
They would come on Saturdays and Sundays and plant trees.
34:12
You had to supervise them.
34:16
They were off Monday or Tuesday, or something like that.
34:20
Was
34:23
the research branch [Forest Service] involved in that, or
34:24
was that mainly management?
34:25
No, no.
34:27
I don’t think that researchers had any role.
34:32
I know they’ve done some of that recently.
34:34
Oh sure, they’re deeply involved with that now, but then, I
34:42
just can’t recall.
34:45
At least not at the district ranger level.
34:49
Yeah, at the other levels, and I don’t know if there was less outreach.
34:54
I’m sure there was some involvement with the students at the university.
34:57
You were saying there was generally a positive impression
34:57
of the Forest Service at that
35:04
time?
35:11
Did you have a sense that
35:15
this began to change at
35:18
some point in that period?
35:18
No, no change.
35:19
That
35:22
was into the ‘60s, that that pattern began to change.
35:26
Although there
35:30
was the big debate about the Three Sisters Wilderness, which took
35:35
place beginning in the early ‘50s.
35:38
[1950s-1960s]
35:39
I was forest ranger in the district
35:44
[Blue River R.D.] , representing the Forest Service, and we had to reclassify
35:59
the Three Sisters Primitive Area to the Three Sisters Wilderness Area.
36:05
Under the Secretary’s [of Agriculture] regulations.
36:05
Yes.
36:05
The wilderness area was over 100,000 acres, and the primitive area [zoning
36:05
name of Forest Service lands for preservation use before Wilderness
36:06
Act of] within that 100,000 areas.
36:17
Now, it’s all wilderness area.
36:21
There’s no distinction anymore.
36:21
Yeah, there’s no distinction, I don’t think.
36:22
What was the controversy involved then?
36:25
Well, in moving
36:30
from the “primitive” category, which I think was more of a study category.
36:35
That’s right, it was more a study area.
36:36
It was designed to kind of put it in a holding pen, and manage it until such
36:44
time as you have a better understanding,
36:49
and make a sharper distinction between primitive and wilderness.
36:56
It was under the secretary’s regulation in those days.
37:01
This was all part of the Wilderness Act.
37:04
We were doing that in the early ‘50s, I guess.
37:07
Were we in the 1950s?
37:09
Yeah.
37:10
And the secretary’s decision, I think, came down in ’55 or
37:13
’56, maybe ’57, I don’t know.
37:16
[Final wilderness designations across nation did not become
37:17
official until the 1960s and later.]
37:17
During my period, anyway.
37:18
Yeah.
37:32
There was a lot of interest, always, in the primitive area
37:32
along the Horse Creek divide, and
37:40
it was an educating moment.
37:41
As soon as we got into that controversy, we got to know these
37:46
people, and that’s when we could tell their word was worth nothing.
37:54
Right away, they demanded
37:57
that anything you’d do here, they wanted over there.
37:58
You’d put it over here
38:03
along that ridge, but they wanted it clear down to the lake.
38:10
French Pete,
38:13
I knew it really well.
38:20
It was French Pete itself, and there was a lot of dead timber there.
38:32
They rode all over it, and I took the lower half-mile.
38:38
I personally laid out the deal on that.
38:41
Then, I got transferred.
38:42
As soon as I got transferred, they
38:55
started to tear it apart.
38:58
I heard all kinds of stories from the other side of the mountain, and they’d
39:03
[environmentalists] go, “Well, that’s not true, and that’s not true,” when they
39:06
didn’t know if it was the truth or not.
39:09
They were questioning the location of the road?
39:11
The road location.
39:11
How everything was going to fall in that creek, all
39:16
that kind of crap.
39:19
The basic issue, though, had to do with after all the studies and
39:24
hearings, was the boundary location.
39:25
They put the boundary for the Three Sisters Wilderness along Horse Creek.
39:32
And they excluded in that area about 42,000 acres, as I recall,
39:38
which included the east fork of the South Fork of the McKenzie, Crawford
39:43
Creek, Rebel Creek, and French Pete Creek; all of the country there.
39:48
There was a road laid out up the east fork, and
39:56
that connected to all of the routes that you rode over out on
39:59
the ridge here, but all of that decision was never supported by
40:08
these radical environmentalists, who probably by today’s
40:12
standards, are pretty tame.
40:13
[Laughs] But, they had some of the same techniques of “anything
40:17
justifying the means.” And the means were somehow to bring this land
40:21
back into a wilderness state, that
40:26
portion of it, anyway, that hadn’t been already developed.
40:29
This guy rode up the
40:35
east fork to the very top, almost into
40:42
-- -- Mosquito Creek.
40:43
Oh hell, they met
40:48
up there at
40:49
-- Oh yeah, at Quaking Aspen.
40:50
Quaking Aspen, right.
40:52
Over on the northeast side.
40:56
They sued over that.
40:59
They logged on that anyway, didn’t they?
41:01
Yeah.
41:01
All that wasn’t roaded, came in, I don’t know, in ’74, or whenever that was.
41:10
I started a
41:16
road going in.
41:18
I guess they quit that,
41:22
didn’t they?
41:22
Well, the first piece of that was built.
41:27
But the whole area was planned for development.
41:32
Tie-in to that east fork.
41:33
Now this didn’t have anything to do with the research forest
41:37
[the H.J. Andrews] , but we were talking about environmental stuff.
41:39
No, that’s interesting.
41:40
Yeah, this was back in the ‘50s, and the issue here was
41:46
determining the final boundaries of the Three Sisters Wilderness Area.
41:50
Yeah.
41:54
They haven’t changed the boundaries of the Andrews, have they?
41:57
Of the Andrews?
41:58
No, I don’t think so.
41:59
I think that’s still
42:04
the same.
42:04
Are they cutting anything in there?
42:06
Oh, very limited.
42:07
But I don’t know, as I haven’t kept up to date, either.
42:12
Sounds like the issue here was similar to what it is now, where they’re concerned
42:15
about roads being put into areas.
42:18
Yeah, this was the same deal.
42:20
Harvest versus no harvest, and development versus no development.
42:24
In all the arguments pro and con on this issue, was there any reference to the
42:28
kind of studies that were being done on the Andrews in that period of time?
42:34
Well, we used some of the concerns about erosion and all that sort of stuff.
42:40
We relied on information that would come in.
42:43
Now, this was in my day.
42:44
Yeah.
42:45
We had information coming out of the Andrews that supported a certain view,
42:54
but that was in opposition to many of the things that these folks were saying.
42:59
So yeah, I used information from the Andrews and published
43:03
reports, that sort of thing.
43:05
They talked about regeneration, and you couldn’t regenerate
43:08
if, you know, blah, blah, blah.
43:10
[Laughing] Well, anyway.
43:13
It sounds like some of the arguments involved here were not so much involved
43:16
with bringing people into the area as it was possible erosion on the forest and
43:21
things like that, so you were able to use the research from the Andrews to show that
43:24
this was probably not going to happen?
43:26
Yeah.
43:27
Yeah.
43:27
Well, that’s interesting.
43:29
But in the ‘50s, when there hadn’t been much stuff published on
43:37
the Andrews, the studies that had been initiated by then,
43:39
like the compaction studies
43:41
-- -- Most of the cutting in the Andrews was staggered-settings, so there
43:46
was much more that hadn’t been cut.
43:53
Yeah, the initial entry was not more than 25 percent of the drainage, I think.
43:58
And that was standard practice for the region [U.S. Forest
44:02
Service Region] as a whole.
44:04
They were modeling that policy within the Andrews, and measuring the
44:10
effects to see if there were problems.
44:12
They were working
44:19
with the staggered-settings, and they could look pretty near ruined
44:20
or destroyed, after only five years.
44:27
Then we got people going, “Well, hell, we’ve got
44:32
50 or 60 years left after these have been cut, so I can show you
44:45
this hill here
44:53
that was cut in ’60 or something like that, and that’s all been planted and
45:13
is growing.
45:14
Pretty freshly harvested at that time.
45:15
Yeah, yeah.
45:19
How long has it come back now?
45:21
About
45:23
20 years.
45:24
Yeah.
45:25
So, the same naysayers current now were then, too.
45:30
They had this different view of how national forests
45:34
should be managed, and they
45:38
didn’t rely on good information in that regard.
45:43
They were just very interested in not having any more harvest, period.
45:48
They would put forward all kinds of dire predictions to
45:54
support their rationale, when really, they should have relied on the
45:59
point that future generations might need something like this, and that
46:02
this was a very basic, core value.
46:05
Well,
46:10
it sounds like what you’re saying, is that the goal of research at
46:15
that time was to model, on the Andrews, what was being
46:17
done, or what should policy be?
46:19
And then,
46:23
identify different ways of doing it.
46:25
The question was, “What will happen if we do it in this fashion?” Is that accurate?
46:29
Yeah, that’s how I would characterize the early ‘50s.
46:33
I characterize the Andrews as a series of
46:38
decadal kind of works.
46:41
The whole notion changes over time.
46:43
Initially, in my judgement, what was driving research was to try to find
46:49
out what effects [to various treatment methods] there were going to be.
46:52
There were
46:57
some innovations in terms of
47:01
different kinds of slash treatments and this sort of thing, practices that
47:06
weren’t commonly used in the region, but were being tried out in the Andrews.
47:15
But soil compaction, from cat-logging versus high-leading, and things like
47:20
that, were going on in the 1950s.
47:21
I had looked forward to
47:29
attacking the Andrews pretty soon [logging old growth]
47:34
. You said, what?
47:35
I’m sorry?
47:35
We were going to “attack” the Andrews, you know, it was all old-growth in there.
47:39
Okay.
47:41
Hmm.
47:42
We hadn’t attacked the Andrews yet.
47:44
Hmm.
47:45
Yeah, I don’t know.
47:46
I don’t either, but we were still gonna
47:53
hire dirty crooks and – [Laughter]
47:54
-- [Laughing] Yeah.
47:57
Sometimes they
48:01
would.
48:01
There was a continuum of those guys out there, the extreme, who were
48:06
absolutely dirty crooks, and there was probably some that would say
48:10
they just didn’t realize what they were doing, poor devils, [laughs]
48:15
on up to those who were supportive of some kind of forest management.
48:19
Way over on this end of the spectrum, being very supportive,
48:23
wondering, why aren’t we doing more.
48:26
Over on this end of the spectrum, you’re kow-towing to these guys over here.
48:33
At least there was that continuum of beliefs along that line.
48:39
That’s been my experience.
48:41
And
48:43
that’s great, that’s what makes the world go around.
48:48
It gets a little
48:53
stressful when you have a room full of these guys that aren’t being
48:57
balanced by anything over here.
49:00
And these folks believe that everyone thinks like they do.
49:09
On this Three Sisters feud, from a management standpoint, did you see
49:14
lessons that were learned from that, or research questions that needed
49:18
to be answered, to help when these kinds of issues came up in the future?
49:22
That’s the only reason research stays the same
49:30
way.
49:30
You know, what would happen if
49:36
…. [Laughs]…study this for fire, study that for cutting.
49:43
We used to do studies for 30 to 50 years.
49:46
And we could go in there and
49:50
tell you, if this was in a wild fire, it would burn up.
49:57
Yeah.
49:57
Are you familiar with the controversy on Warner Creek?
50:00
Yeah.
50:02
Of course, Mike,
50:06
you inherited it.
50:08
What you were saying, is that fire moves in if it’s [forest and natural
50:09
resources] not taken care of, if it’s not managed, and it will be struck by fire?
50:13
Is that the point?
50:15
Well, no.
50:16
It’s that folks on this end of the spectrum [more “progressive”] will
50:18
say, “Gosh, we need to study that to see what natural effects follow the
50:22
fire,” and all of this forest came in that way [after fire] . It’s a vast
50:29
laboratory that already exists out there, that in fact, has been studied.
50:37
They’re in books.
50:37
They [scientists, environmentalists, etc.] could go to the library and
50:38
find all the answers they want.
50:40
Well,
50:45
maybe not all the answers.
50:46
There’s new questions always arising and new technology to answer those
50:51
questions, but a lot of the basics, I think, are becoming understood.
51:03
Some of the issues raised in the early ‘50s regarding this particular
51:09
controversy [Three Sisters Wilderness, French Pete area] that became “research
51:10
questions” [U.S. Forest Service lexicon] , were modeled here and
51:13
elsewhere in the research community.
51:16
Now that’s an assumption on my part, but that’s probably true.
51:23
These groups, they’d camp up there at Andrews, and
51:32
they’d
51:36
take each other down and show each other to see where the dam hollows out up there.
51:37
[Laughs]
51:37
Oh, Yeah.
51:37
And they’d tell you why you can’t touch that.
51:37
And then, they’d tell you they’ve spotted an owl here, and why, you can’t cut that.
51:37
[Laughs]
51:37
In the late ‘50s, if you
51:51
had
51:56
a problem as
52:00
a manager that you needed an answer to,
52:06
what would be the pathway that you would go through to get that
52:08
request or suggestion across to the research branch from the district?
52:13
Would you go from the district to region, and then from there to the
52:15
PNW Station, or would you go directly to somebody from the station?
52:22
Hmm?
52:22
My throat’s getting
52:26
kind of dry.
52:31
I know there’s been a big change
52:39
in leadership in the Forest Service.
52:42
Mike might agree that a lot of it wasn’t real formal.
52:56
I’m sorry, you said that a lot of it was not worth it?
53:00
Oh sure, to some it’s worth it, but to me,
53:04
it isn’t.
53:05
I’ve had a stroke.
53:08
Just from a pure history standpoint, I was at a
53:14
very early point in my career [student at University of Minnesota on summer hire]
53:15
, and I can’t recall what the pathways might have been in those early days.
53:21
I expect interaction with a guy like Jack Rothacher,
53:26
who might have influenced that to some degree.
53:31
My guess is the policy issues probably came from much higher levels than that.
53:36
Uh-huh.
53:36
But I don’t know.
53:37
I can’t remember.
53:38
It sounds like you did have some level of interaction with scientists
53:42
like Roy Silen and others out there, so that kind of conversation make
53:46
it possible to exchange ideas.
53:48
We were using Jerry Franklin.
53:50
He was
54:00
a scientist,
54:05
and he’d say, “I’m tired of having these clear-cuts. This kind of cutting.”
54:09
Right.
54:18
Well, he was very resistant to it [Franklin wanted alternatives
54:20
to straight clear-cutting]
54:20
. Although he’s supportive of timber harvesting,
54:24
he wanted to leave a lot more dead and down, and growing, living material, too.
54:32
But, he’s not against harvesting.
54:34
No.
54:36
Today, anyway.
54:40
But I don’t know Jerry today, either.
54:43
[Laughing] He’s probably changed his views along the way, but I know Jerry
54:46
ten years ago was supportive of modeling
54:53
nature’s way in a totally different way than standard
54:59
clear-cutting, but still harvesting.
55:02
Yeah,
55:05
but there’ll be a lot more
55:09
dead timber on the east side right now.
55:11
Yeah.
55:13
When will they stop it?
55:16
Yeah.
55:25
I think they know now why
55:31
those divisions are there and what they are, but I don’t hear
55:34
any of them saying that cattle
55:41
invading in 1914 or 1916, left that country as barren ground.
55:49
That area was bare ground.
55:51
Now, it’s thousands of trees per acre.
55:55
The trees grew.
55:56
They raised cattle from California and drove them north, and
56:02
then, they drove them back.
56:05
A bunch of cattle grazed here.
56:08
That
56:12
only lasted a few years.
56:14
[Interrupting] Well
56:14
-- [Continuing]
56:19
-- They
56:26
changed the old stands of the forest
56:30
when
56:36
they’d do this logging.
56:37
They did the logging of Ponderosa pine,
56:44
and they put in some seedlings of Douglas-fir, white fir, and
56:59
subalpine
57:08
fir,
57:11
that’s come in now in this particular area.
57:19
All the beetles came in, and they weren’t there very long.
57:24
Were you concerned in the ‘50s about fire research, and the use
57:32
of fire as a management tool?
57:34
Was that something that was a concern?
57:36
We weren’t that worried about
57:59
it, frankly.
58:03
Hmm.
58:07
Over in Montana, it seems pretty wild-eyed.
58:08
Of course, there’s a group of environmentalists who want to
58:08
stop the world over there, too.
58:25
You were talking earlier about Jerry Franklin.
58:31
When he started doing work on the IBP program,
58:35
several sites were designated as research natural areas [RNAs] . The 1950s
58:41
was
58:46
a period of real interest in establishing RNAs.
58:49
Was that a priority when you were involved in management in that area?
58:55
How did you view the Research Natural Area Program?
59:01
Well,
59:04
we had no particular interest in them.
59:07
We
59:10
had 6500-7000 acres to manage, and didn’t have anybody who wanted to go
59:20
in there with it [the RNA concept] . It didn’t bother us.
59:25
Uh-huh.
59:36
What was done there was funded with timber sale dollars, I think, from the Andrews?
59:43
Well I don’t know.
59:44
No, they wanted us to do as much as we could.
59:47
The foresters wanted us to do work there [experimental forests, RNAs, etc.]
59:50
. They didn’t have too many foresters.
59:50
Right.
59:52
But funds for things like replanting, regenerating, and that sort of thing,
59:55
were generated by the timber sales.
59:56
Yeah.
59:58
But there must have been some research funds, too.
1:00:00
Obviously, they had to design the studies and to support the researchers there.
1:00:04
Yeah.
1:00:05
But the money for laying the timber sales out and so on,
1:00:09
probably came out of our funds.
1:00:11
I think so.
1:00:13
Yeah.
1:00:16
And they’d be counted under your allocated cut for that year?
1:00:20
No, I think it was always unregulated out there, but it would be part
1:00:24
of the unregulated harvest.
1:00:25
Yeah, okay.
1:00:31
Wasn’t much
1:00:34
designated to be used in the Andrews,
1:00:40
either.
1:00:41
Hmm?
1:00:41
Although
1:00:47
sometimes they would give it to you with the understanding that you’d do some
1:00:53
work in the Andrews [with the funds]
1:00:53
. Right.
1:00:54
Like the trail construction project in the Andrews.
1:00:56
Yeah.
1:00:57
Some unique things like that.
1:01:06
So it sounds
1:01:21
like your impression is that, essentially, research wasn’t a major
1:01:26
burden on management at that time, but it wasn’t a major concern either.
1:01:29
Is that an accurate characterization?
1:01:33
Oh yeah.
1:01:35
Well,
1:01:41
our cutting had some research tied to
1:01:50
it, all our cutting.
1:02:01
Every year we’d do
1:02:12
some of that.
1:02:13
We were fine.
1:02:14
Anything we
1:02:29
wanted to do, we did it.
1:02:32
In terms of staffing, did it take much of your budget or available
1:02:37
personnel to manage the Andrews?
1:02:39
No.
1:02:40
[continuing] – running the program?
1:02:42
No.
1:02:43
No, there wasn’t anything specifically set up on the Andrews, as there is now.
1:02:49
Yeah.
1:02:49
It wasn’t then.
1:02:50
Our sale administrator, he administered elsewhere in the district [Blue River
1:02:51
R.D.] as well as there [H.J. Andrews]
1:02:51
. Yeah.
1:03:04
Well, we’re probably [laughing] wearing Ed out.
1:03:08
Yeah.
1:03:08
Yeah.
1:03:09
Probably a good place to stop.
1:03:17
What I wanted to do here
1:03:22
is back up a little bit and talk about your early involvement with the Andrews,
1:03:28
and some of the special pathways and ways that you came to that work.
1:03:32
You mentioned you started there as a student in 1952?
1:03:34
Yes, I was on the McKenzie [Ranger] District from Minnesota
1:03:43
[student
1:03:46
at Univ. of Minn.] , and I was in some special category.
1:03:48
I can’t dredge the name up right now.
1:03:51
The idea was to get
1:03:57
student foresters from across the country, instead of all from the west.
1:04:05
I got a job with the Forest Service through one of those special
1:04:10
programs, and came out, the first time in ’52, working with the Forest
1:04:15
Service there at McKenzie Bridge.
1:04:17
That was before the McKenzie and Blue River districts were formed.
1:04:21
It was all the McKenzie District.
1:04:25
That first summer I spent
1:04:30
mapping various parts of the
1:04:35
forest.
1:04:36
In those days you always ran out of money, and before the end of the fiscal year,
1:04:41
which probably you still do to this day.
1:04:47
One of my tasks was to work with one of the handymen there at McKenzie Bridge,
1:04:55
and prepare the site for the dedication of the Andrews [In 1953, for name change
1:04:58
from Blue River Experimental Forest to H.J. Andrews E.F. in honor Horace J.
1:04:58
Andrews, Region 6 Chief Forester, and prospective future U.S. Forest Service
1:04:58
Chief, who died in a 1951 car accident]
1:04:59
. Oh?
1:04:59
At the entrance to the Andrews, somebody had moved in a big rock,
1:05:04
and they had a brass plaque.
1:05:07
I helped set the
1:05:11
cornerstones,
1:05:14
the other rockwork, that kind of stuff, and the landscaping for that event.
1:05:19
That was my entrance, [laughs] my introduction to the Andrews.
1:05:24
This was in early June of 1952.
1:05:30
I can’t remember that I worked there then.
1:05:35
The next year I came out, in 1953, and actually did some layouts of some of those
1:05:41
goofy sales that Ed [Anderson] talked about [in earlier interview] . We did some
1:05:42
layouts for the small, circular units.
1:05:46
And
1:05:50
then, I graduated in 1954 and began work with the Forest Service at
1:05:53
Lowell on the Willamette River, and in May of 1956, I came over as
1:06:04
the first district assistant to work with Ed.
1:06:09
Ed was the Ranger at Blue River.
1:06:12
And, as I mentioned earlier, my neighbor was Jack Rothacher.
1:06:15
We were good friends.
1:06:18
Jack and Jean [Jack’s wife] were wonderful people, and Jack
1:06:23
was a dedicated researcher.
1:06:28
In those days, I don’t think he had a graduate degree.
1:06:30
Well, he may have had a master’s degree.
1:06:35
He was involved in laying out and setting up the small watersheds program,
1:06:47
the calibration of those watersheds,
1:06:54
and in developing the logic for treatments of those watersheds.
1:07:00
Then, I left in 1959, and
1:07:05
came back as district ranger in 1967 at Blue River.
1:07:13
So, your degree was from University of Minnesota?
1:07:16
Yeah.
1:07:17
Let’s see, what was your area of interest?
1:07:21
Forest management.
1:07:21
Forest management.
1:07:22
What was your perception of the experimental forest [H.J. Andrews]
1:07:26
when you came out in 1952?
1:07:28
There wasn’t very much there at that time, was there?
1:07:29
No, the main road up Lookout Creek was there in 1952.
1:07:39
I really can’t remember how much further, or how extensive the road network was.
1:07:48
But it wasn’t very extensive, anyway.
1:07:53
You were at the initiation ceremonies, or whatever?
1:07:56
[Renaming the experimental forest from Blue River E.F. to honor H.
1:07:56
J. Andrews, as referenced earlier.]
1:07:58
No, I didn’t.
1:08:00
I was a lowly worker in those days.
1:08:04
So, I didn’t get to the dedication ceremony.
1:08:08
And then, when you came back in ‘56, it sounds like Jack Rothacher was your
1:08:10
closest colleague who you worked with?
1:08:12
Well, no.
1:08:13
He just happened to be my next-door neighbor.
1:08:17
My job in those days was fire control for the whole district;
1:08:21
and trail maintenance, road maintenance, recreation, regeneration,
1:08:27
and reforestation.
1:08:34
I had all those duties, and many of those same things happened on the Andrews,
1:08:39
road maintenance and that type of thing.
1:08:43
We did a little trail construction job there for the research folks to
1:08:49
provide the access for the control watershed [Watershed] . Because I
1:08:55
was a professional in that job, I took an interest in the Andrews.
1:08:59
I’ve always had an interest in the
1:09:05
knowledge, the information-gathering side of research.
1:09:12
I had a strong feeling
1:09:18
you had to be involved in research kinds of activities
1:09:21
to help guide our management.
1:09:25
So, I’ve been a strong supporter of research throughout my
1:09:32
career.
1:09:32
I have been frustrated at times that we weren’t getting answers we needed,
1:09:37
but supported the notion we ought to be going after those questions.
1:09:44
From the very beginning,
1:09:47
I had an interest in the Andrews, and was excited about what was going on there.
1:09:53
We were friends with some researchers there, too, some young folks
1:09:59
out from South Dakota.
1:10:00
He [one he met] was part of the Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit at
1:10:07
Corvallis, and he was living at Lucky Boy [camp] , doing research, I think, on deer.
1:10:16
This was in ’56, ’57.
1:10:17
McDonald, I think was his name.
1:10:18
He
1:10:28
was a young fella at the time.
1:10:30
A grad student.
1:10:34
Anyways, I left in ’59, and
1:10:39
came back in ’66.
1:10:42
As I mentioned earlier in the interview with Ed, my notion of what was going
1:10:44
on in the ‘50s was being driven by
1:10:48
the question
1:10:53
how should we manage these forests that were represented in the
1:10:57
Andrews - old-growth Douglas-fir, by-and-large -- how best to road the
1:11:04
landscape, what effects would harvest
1:11:08
of these forests have on soil compaction, those sorts of things.
1:11:15
A whole host of research designed to answer those types of questions
1:11:20
were going on at the time.
1:11:22
Or, the studies were being set up, like the watershed program, with calibration
1:11:27
of watersheds going on in the ‘50s.
1:11:30
The treatments
1:11:33
of the watersheds started in the ‘60s,
1:11:39
and were completed by the time I got back as ranger.
1:11:45
Over your career, it sounds like they were bringing you here and taking you away.
1:11:49
[Laughing] Yeah.
1:11:50
I guess at the time, you were just getting started in your career.
1:11:51
Yeah.
1:11:51
Right.
1:11:51
And so, you probably didn’t have a whole lot of choice where you were going.
1:11:55
Right.
1:11:55
But were you attracted there at that time, by the Andrews itself?
1:11:58
No, it just happened to be there.
1:12:00
So from the Andrews, you went to Baker [Mt.
1:12:04
Baker National Forest]
1:12:05
? Yeah, from the Blue River District, I went to the Monte Cristo District
1:12:08
of the Mount Baker National Forest in northern Washington.
1:12:13
This was back when the Mount Baker was still a national forest by itself.
1:12:18
Now it’s combined with the Snoqualmie.
1:12:20
But then, it was a national forest, with its own supervisor
1:12:25
in Bellingham [Washington]
1:12:27
. I spent seven years up there, and then came back to Oakridge in charge
1:12:34
of timber management on that ranger district [Lowell R.D., Willamette
1:12:39
N.F.] . Then, a year-and-a-half later or so, I came over here in January
1:12:42
of ’67 as the district ranger.
1:12:45
I know in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, it was pretty common in the Forest Service
1:12:51
for senior managers to identify people to “bring along” in the Forest Service.
1:12:54
Uh-huh.
1:12:55
Were you aware of anybody that was a particular mentor or close
1:12:58
contact who supported your career?
1:13:00
Not really.
1:13:01
I
1:13:09
had mentors like Dave Gibney
1:13:16
and Chris Weil,
1:13:21
but I didn’t have somebody that at the time I understood was my mentor.
1:13:27
[Laughs]
1:13:27
Were there any people there shaping your ideas about how to
1:13:27
manage a forest in that period?
1:13:27
Yeah.
1:13:35
I think researchers have had a role in that, like Jack Rothacher,
1:13:42
some of his ideas and concerns.
1:13:51
When I came back as ranger,
1:13:56
I interacted quite a bit with the research community.
1:14:03
Bob Harris was, I think, deputy station [PNW] director at the time, and the
1:14:06
Andrews was part of his geographic area.
1:14:10
A guy by
1:14:15
the name of Dick Fredriksen did work out here, Ted Dyrness, and
1:14:20
of course, Jerry Franklin.
1:14:24
Phil Briegleb was
1:14:28
out here quite a bit.
1:14:28
And of course, in the ‘60s we were wound up, hell-bent, in the French Pete issue.
1:14:40
We had a lot of research folks involved in that, as well as folks
1:14:44
from national forest management,
1:14:48
trying to come up with the best science to manage that area, and
1:14:53
develop the plan for management.
1:14:55
So, there was a lot of interaction.
1:14:57
This French Pete issue.
1:14:58
You mentioned that earlier, but we didn’t talk about it, I don’t think.
1:15:01
No, though it grew out of a larger concern.
1:15:06
The
1:15:09
French Pete issue began in the early ‘50s during discussions about the Three Sisters
1:15:16
Wilderness and how that would be shaped, what the final boundaries would be.
1:15:22
That’s where folks never let that decision lie.
1:15:28
So it came back.
1:15:31
There was pressure from the moment the ink was dry, in ’57, on the secretary’s [Sec.
1:15:39
of Ag.] decision.
1:15:40
The final solution, was
1:15:44
when it was brought into the wilderness system by legislation introduced by
1:15:51
Hatfield [Mark-Senator, R-OR] , either Hatfield or Packwood [Bob-Senator,
1:15:53
OR] . I wasn’t here at the time, but
1:16:01
folks who felt very strongly about that just wouldn’t let it go.
1:16:06
[Laughs] They kept hanging in there and hanging in there and hanging in there.
1:16:09
When I arrived in ’67,
1:16:16
the practice during those days was to “pre-ad” a sale that might be offered
1:16:25
in the dead of winter. It would provide purchasers and others an opportunity to
1:16:30
get into the ground before the snows.
1:16:35
So, there was a big uproar when that sale was pre-added in the fall of ’66.
1:16:41
I remember one of my first jobs as ranger was to personally go in on
1:16:47
snowshoes and take a look at that.
1:16:50
Huh.
1:16:50
That sale.
1:16:53
And I had some concerns.
1:16:55
I told Dave [Gibney –Blue River District Ranger] that the layout,
1:17:01
had been done some years earlier, and it just didn’t have the kind of
1:17:08
stream-side protection and so on, that
1:17:12
we were doing even then.
1:17:14
You know, it didn’t meet current-day standards.
1:17:17
So, I suggested to Dave that we not go forward with the sale.
1:17:22
It might prove to be embarrassing, if we did go forward with it, because
1:17:28
it didn’t meet today’s standards.
1:17:30
Or 1967 standards.
1:17:34
And so, we pulled the sale, and then we
1:17:37
put a lot of energy into redesigning the sale, relocating the road.
1:17:44
The road came up the bottom of the creek, and that just
1:17:48
wasn’t the best location for it.
1:17:50
We came in at the top on much better ground, and then, in the process, we
1:17:55
developed this overall management plan for the drainage, and relied a lot on
1:18:04
the published research and what-not, to analyze the effects and so on.
1:18:11
How had things changed between 1959 and ’67 in terms of the Andrews,
1:18:14
and the facilities, and the people
1:18:19
there?
1:18:19
By the time I came back, there was a lab set up in the ranger
1:18:25
station office, there was
1:18:31
a technician, Ros Mersereau, that took care of the day-to-day things.
1:18:39
The professionals [higher station/research-centered Forest
1:18:40
Service personnel] , by then, had retreated back to Corvallis.
1:18:43
I shouldn’t say retreated, but
1:18:50
I think they found it was pretty lonely for a researcher out here
1:18:54
in terms of their own personal growth.
1:18:58
There still wasn’t a headquarters site out at the forest.
1:19:03
That came later, initially, I guess in the ‘70s, but it came
1:19:04
into full-flower in the ‘80s and
1:19:11
in the ‘90s.
1:19:14
Yeah.
1:19:14
Roy Silen was talking about his trailer out there and the poker games
1:19:17
they had out there, and that that was something that attracted people.
1:19:22
Yeah, yeah.
1:19:23
[Laughter] By the time I came back in ’67,
1:19:29
I think there was a trailer that was assigned to the
1:19:32
Andrews, up on a trailer pad.
1:19:34
And they still had a house here [Blue River] . where Ros Mersereau lived.
1:19:38
But the group that came down to do work on the Andrews in the
1:19:44
‘60s, hung out in the trailers
1:19:49
there in the ‘60s.
1:19:49
I left in 1970, and
1:19:54
the next big change occurred in the late ‘60s and continued
1:20:01
through the ‘70s, and that was the International Biome Program, the IBP.
1:20:05
That I think, really signaled a big shift in emphasis on the Andrews.
1:20:14
At least in my head, that’s how I see it.
1:20:17
The ‘50s and ‘60s were devoted to trying to get answers that we needed
1:20:28
on the obvious effects of management on water and on soil, and how to
1:20:35
best regenerate stands, what’s the best kind of silviculture, and so on.
1:20:40
But the IBP was focused more on how the ecosystem did function.
1:20:44
You had these wild people and trapezes up in the trees studying
1:20:50
moss and lichens, and all kinds of things that didn’t occur to a dirt
1:20:56
forester to be of any interest at all.
1:20:59
But certainly, it became very, very important, that whole
1:21:05
10-year effort just moving things forward
1:21:11
at a speed that couldn’t have happened without it.
1:21:14
I think that’s a real significant effort.
1:21:20
And the fact that the Andrews was selected, I think, just
1:21:25
made a big difference in what sorts of science got done, and the
1:21:30
understanding that we have of these forests that that came out of that.
1:21:35
Was there a benefit from a management standpoint to the district, to have the
1:21:39
Andrews selected as part of that program?
1:21:42
Just from a gee-whiz kind of a view, I’m trying to
1:21:53
think back to the initial reaction, which probably was, “God Almighty, we’re putting
1:21:59
money into this stuff?” when we really should be focusing on stuff that I, as a
1:22:04
ranger, was burning to have answers for.
1:22:08
But in retrospect, devoting that kind of energy and capital into
1:22:14
basic research really has paid off.
1:22:18
A tremendous payoff.
1:22:21
However that happened, those folks ought to be saluted, in my judgement.
1:22:24
Okay, go ahead.
1:22:26
We
1:22:29
often don’t pay attention to that, that basic level of research that does
1:22:33
have payoff, only you can’t really put a finger on it to say that you’re
1:22:37
committing the capital to do it.
1:22:41
Managers
1:22:44
are frustrated by not having information today.
1:22:48
[Laughing] I need this information today to answer these questions.
1:22:53
What kinds of problems were you facing that you needed answers to?
1:22:58
In
1:23:03
that period in the ‘60s, we
1:23:09
were having problems with regeneration, problems with
1:23:14
unwanted vegetation, and how to best control unwanted vegetation.
1:23:20
There were lots of nuts and bolts kinds of things we really
1:23:24
hadn’t gotten on top of yet.
1:23:28
By the end
1:23:31
of the ‘70s, the nursery practices changed, so
1:23:37
I think we really got control of regeneration.
1:23:42
All of that came out of research that was going on in the ‘60s, I would guess.
1:23:48
But then, you’re facing those sorts of problems that you want answers to right
1:23:53
now, and there weren’t good answers.
1:23:58
Who would you appeal to if you had a problem that you thought needed
1:24:00
to be researched at that time?
1:24:00
What would you do?
1:24:03
I think our avenue was through the chain of command, through the forest and so on.
1:24:08
We probably had a leg up here by interacting at the ground level
1:24:11
with researchers, but I didn’t influence basic designs of research.
1:24:21
It would kind of float up through the hierarchy.
1:24:23
We'd rant and rave to the staff, and he would kind of collect that input.
1:24:32
[Laughs] It was all kind of a mystery at that point.
1:24:34
So, it’s kind of a mystery.
1:24:35
When I ask the same question of the scientists, I get kind
1:24:37
of the same answer, actually.
1:24:38
Is that right?
1:24:38
It’s kind of a mystery to them, sometimes, how they came about
1:24:40
some kinds of research subjects.
1:24:40
Yeah, yeah.
1:24:43
But you did have quite a bit of interaction, it sounds like, at least
1:24:46
more interaction at that point, than you might have had in the 1950s?
1:24:49
Yeah, oh yeah.
1:24:50
Right.
1:24:50
And the staff at the Andrews was growing.
1:24:53
There were more scientists involved.
1:24:59
I left in 1970, and went down to work in timber staff on the Six
1:25:05
Rivers [National Forest] in Northern California, and then came back to the
1:25:13
Mount Hood [National Forest] as Deputy Forest Supervisor on the Mount Hood.
1:25:19
From there, down
1:25:25
as supervisor
1:25:29
of the Coconino [National Forest-AZ] . We had an experimental forest there too, in
1:25:31
fact one of the very early, early, early ones, and it was established in 1908.
1:25:40
Oh, God!
1:25:44
[Laughs].
1:25:44
Dear me, I can’t dredge up the name of it now [Fort Valley Experimental
1:25:46
Forest, just west of Flagstaff, Arizona] . Anyway, it’s not important.
1:25:49
The important thing, though, is the relationship of the researchers on
1:25:53
that unit to, say the district ranger and the other managers on the forest.
1:26:00
It was just totally different than it was on the Andrews.
1:26:03
Hmm.
1:26:04
How so?
1:26:08
Very little interaction, a distinct
1:26:14
“we-they” kind of attitude.
1:26:19
It was just totally different.
1:26:21
Now,
1:26:28
that was the formal experimental forest in the forest [Coconino N.F.] . The
1:26:34
other thing that was going on at that point was that the Beaver Creek project.
1:26:39
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of the Beaver Creek project?
1:26:42
I don’t know about that, no.
1:26:44
It was a demonstration area,
1:26:48
and there was a heavy research component.
1:26:50
It
1:26:54
was designed to answer the water issues of the day, the grazing
1:27:00
issues, and so on, in the Southwest.
1:27:04
What was the best way to increase water yield, and so on, in that arid state.
1:27:09
It was heavily influenced by the Salt River Project
1:27:15
and the grazing ranchers’ community.
1:27:22
I interacted with that group, not a whole lot, but it was still a “we-they” kind
1:27:27
of thing, from the district standpoint.
1:27:31
Really interesting.
1:27:34
What do you think accounts for the difference?
1:27:36
I don’t know, it’s hard for me to know.
1:27:41
Then I came back as supervisor on the Willamette.
1:27:44
Jim Caswell was district ranger at Blue River [R.D.] at the time.
1:27:56
I had a better partnership than my predecessors had at the Andrews
1:28:01
when I was ranger in the late ‘60s.
1:28:05
The partnership had developed
1:28:09
stronger at that point.
1:28:13
I really wanted to build that partnership into a stronger partnership.
1:28:19
In fact, in selecting a replacement for Jim [Caswell] , as Jim was down to
1:28:25
be deputy over on the Boise [National Forest] , I selected Steve Eubanks.
1:28:32
Part of the interview with all of the candidates was
1:28:38
this notion of partnering, and the fact that we had this
1:28:43
incredible resource there.
1:28:44
And also, my want to build on that partnership and
1:28:49
certainly not do anything to
1:28:54
negatively affect it, but to nurture it and see it grow.
1:29:02
By then, the Andrews had matured, and it was just an incredible source of
1:29:10
information, of data, and knowledge, and we needed that knowledge to
1:29:17
better improve the practices there on the Willamette [National Forest]
1:29:21
. Well, my God, Steve turned out to be an incredible [laughs] person.
1:29:28
He probably spent more energy and effort on the Andrews
1:29:37
than I wanted, but I could see great things happening there.
1:29:46
The partnership really flowered under his administration.
1:29:48
Was there anything that made him stand out from other candidates in that interview?
1:29:50
Hmm?
1:29:50
Was there anything in that interview that you were asking, especially
1:29:53
about partnerships, or making that a purpose of the interview?
1:29:55
Was there anything that really made him stand out from other people?
1:29:57
Yeah.
1:29:58
It was his interest, also.
1:30:00
He had a strong interest.
1:30:02
At least he indicated that to me, that this indeed, was a strong
1:30:08
area of his interest as well.
1:30:10
And it didn’t come out as strong with the other folks that I interviewed.
1:30:13
Frankly, I can’t recall who all I interviewed, but Steve stood out
1:30:19
as a very strong advocate of the management/research marriage, how
1:30:30
you could tap into that knowledge base, and make it work, as opposed to
1:30:36
ignoring it or trying to…..[Laughs].
1:30:39
Can you recall what his background was at that point?
1:30:41
Well, he was district ranger at Bear Springs.
1:30:49
Was he involved in those kinds of partnerships earlier?
1:30:50
I don’t know.
1:30:54
I can’t recall, frankly, that he had.
1:30:56
But when he came, he really made that thing hum.
1:31:01
The basic elements were there.
1:31:09
My partnering had been pretty informal, but by the time Caswell
1:31:14
was on the scene, there were monthly meetings, and there was
1:31:20
a strong sense of this triad that manages that area
1:31:21
[Willamette NF, PNW Station, OSU]
1:31:26
. Ralph Anderson was instrumental on my staff in making that
1:31:30
work and nurturing it,
1:31:35
but Steve really developed that thing into something else.
1:31:40
I look at the ‘80s as
1:31:45
strengthening that
1:31:49
management-research relationship, and really
1:31:55
handing off information
1:31:59
correctly to managers, and doing it in such a way that we were able
1:32:03
to utilize it, and develop new standards for the forest plan.
1:32:08
At the same point we were putting together the forest plan,
1:32:15
we changed practices almost overnight, on things like large, woody debris.
1:32:22
When I came on the forest, we were still into Y.U.M. yarding, “yarding
1:32:28
unutilized material,” putting it in huge piles, and disposing of it the
1:32:34
best way we could. If the chip market was up, it went into chips, if the
1:32:38
market wasn’t up, it went up in smoke.
1:32:40
That started in the
1:32:45
‘60s, so there was a 14-year period, maybe, where
1:32:53
the focus was on clean, clean, clean, clean everything.
1:33:00
Knowledge gained in the ‘70s on the Andrews and other places, convinced us
1:33:07
that this was not a good practice at all.
1:33:10
Overnight, we changed
1:33:13
that whole damn thing, and that was not an easy thing to do.
1:33:15
You had technicians on the forest, that this is what they got stroked
1:33:21
on, how clean that forest looked, and how good a job they did.
1:33:25
The same way with purchasers and loggers.
1:33:30
They grumbled about bringing in all that stuff [to the landing] , but they had a
1:33:34
pride that it just looked better to them.
1:33:38
To change that whole thing around….[Laughs]
1:33:39
Yeah.
1:33:40
I think it was probably also a money thing.
1:33:45
In our appraisals, we tried to make an estimate of how much it
1:33:49
[logging operations, from cutting to removal/cleanup] cost, and loggers found
1:33:51
ways to be more efficient at that, so, it was a money-making deal for them,
1:33:57
too [To not do YUM-yarding] . That was not an easy thing to turn around.
1:34:05
But, we did it overnight.
1:34:07
That, and leaving snags and a bunch of
1:34:12
green trees per acre;
1:34:16
all had their beginnings on the Andrews.
1:34:19
We took the ideas and put them into practice, in a very short
1:34:23
period of time on the Willamette, and then, in the region as well.
1:34:29
I think we were viewed as, or at least I viewed ourselves as, the
1:34:32
leaders in that whole effort.
1:34:34
At the staffing level, was there a shift in the recruitment policies in the forest?
1:34:42
Yeah, during that period we put a person who eventually evolved into
1:34:49
what John Cissel [research and science liaison focused on “technology
1:34:50
transfer”] was at Blue River [R.D.] . We funded him out of the National
1:34:56
Forest system fund. The idea was
1:35:03
that person would be the transfer agent, the person that would really
1:35:11
help move information, or the flow of information from research to management,
1:35:17
and vice versa. The first person we had in that job really didn’t
1:35:29
cut the mustard, in my judgement.
1:35:32
It wasn’t his fault, he just was more an introspective person.
1:35:36
He wasn’t a communicator.
1:35:39
Was this before Cissel was hired?
1:35:41
Yeah.
1:35:42
Who was
1:35:45
that?
1:35:45
Oh, God.
1:35:47
I can see him.
1:35:50
I don’t want to say his name, anyway.
1:35:51
[Vince Puleo]
1:35:51
Okay, that’s fine.
1:35:52
But anyway, he was a good person, but he just wasn’t a communicator,
1:35:57
the job wasn’t getting done, and the ranger agreed with me.
1:36:01
I can’t remember whether it was under Steve when we made that change, or
1:36:06
under Lynn [Burditt] . But, I did the same focused-kind of interview
1:36:11
with people who I interviewed following Steve’s departure, and
1:36:20
I felt that Lynn would carry on that tradition.
1:36:26
This is Lynn Burditt?
1:36:26
Yeah.
1:36:27
Okay.
1:36:28
Lynn isn’t as gung-ho as Steve, or at least I thought so, but she brought a
1:36:35
different perspective and I think was equally effective on the whole area of
1:36:43
bringing data and ideas on.
1:36:44
In fact, more effective, just because the situation changes,
1:36:55
the adaptive management areas, and all that sort of thing, just brought more
1:36:59
attention and more focus onto the flow of information between researchers
1:37:09
and management.
1:37:10
One of the scientists said it was almost scary the way Steve Eubanks
1:37:14
would latch onto something, and he would do it before they were really
1:37:16
sure about what they should be doing.
1:37:17
Yeah, I know.
1:37:18
That was a curse of Steve, but it was also, the researchers
1:37:22
felt pretty damn good about that.
1:37:25
I felt a little nervous also, but I was encouraged by what Steve was doing.
1:37:31
I wasn’t going to discourage it.
1:37:32
From a forest management standpoint, did you get a sense of
1:37:37
a shift in research, in the kinds of people that were there, and
1:37:40
their attitudes about cooperation with management, in that period?
1:37:43
Yeah, I think so.
1:37:49
It took a long time to nurture that relationship.
1:37:52
It didn’t happen overnight, but it did happen, whereas other
1:37:58
places, it hasn’t happened.
1:37:59
Probably hasn’t happened yet.
1:38:01
So, it takes energy to
1:38:06
make that happen.
1:38:08
It takes somebody to support and nurture that, and encourage it
1:38:14
to make it happen, on both sides.
1:38:17
And when it happens, my God, it’s incredible.
1:38:19
[Chuckles] Because it’s worth doing.
1:38:23
So, I kind of characterize the ‘80s as the Andrews kind of
1:38:28
coming into full flower, with
1:38:33
the site being fully developed, or a hell of a lot more fully developed than it
1:38:37
had been before the office construction.
1:38:40
We supplied some surplus trailers out there, to kind of get them
1:38:45
going, and by the end of the ‘80s,
1:38:52
they were well underway with the site, as far as we could figure.
1:39:01
Do you think there were any external factors?
1:39:03
It didn’t just shift from the old system to the new?
1:39:07
Oh, sure.
1:39:08
The whole emphasis was on ecosystem management,
1:39:14
the old-growth battles, all that stuff, I think, certainly,
1:39:18
So environmental disputes, the policy shifts, and I’m not sure what else?
1:39:22
Sure.
1:39:22
Right.
1:39:23
All that had a play, including legislators,
1:39:29
like Hatfield, and others who
1:39:35
were able to get funds for site development and that sort of thing.
1:39:40
Okay.
1:39:41
I left before Clinton came into office, but that certainly
1:39:47
has had an effect, as well.
1:39:48
So you left in ’90?
1:39:50
Yeah,
1:39:54
in January of ’91.
1:39:55
I’ve been involved to some degree,
1:40:02
but certainly not to any great degree.
1:40:06
But, as an outsider, looking at that whole thing, certainly the Northwest
1:40:10
Forest Plan and the focus on scientists and so on, has had more effect to
1:40:19
continue this interchange of information.
1:40:23
Do you think from the ‘70s on into the ‘90s, there was a change in how the
1:40:27
local community perceived the Andrews?
1:40:30
You know, I don’t know.
1:40:31
Do you mean, by
1:40:35
the mill folks?
1:40:38
No, there’s a couple of community things I’m looking at.
1:40:41
One I’m especially interested in, is the immediate vicinity around Blue River, how
1:40:45
the people view research scientists in the Forest Service, and how that changed.
1:40:50
I’m probably not the one to ask that question.
1:40:58
Somebody like Lynn [Burditt] will have a better feel
1:41:05
for that, I think.
1:41:05
You mentioned Hatfield several times.
1:41:07
What about political support or enthusiasm for those kinds of
1:41:14
activities?
1:41:14
Yeah, I’ve had a lot of folks when I was supervisor for 10 years, and
1:41:20
we had lots of field trips to the Andrews with folks like DeFazio
1:41:27
and staffers from various politicians [Congressional staffers] , and I know
1:41:33
the scientists there had them on-site.
1:41:40
I think there’s been a shift in thinking there, although they
1:41:43
fall back every so often [laughs], the infamous “salvage rider.”
1:41:49
[Legislation endorsing salvage logging of burned forest] . I support
1:41:54
the notion that we need to really
1:42:00
be timely
1:42:03
about going in and salvaging or doing something to support the health of these
1:42:08
forests to make them more fireproof.
1:42:15
I think the Warner Creek example just screams at that, that here you are four
1:42:22
years later. I drove by there the other day and they’ve got this sea of snags, and
1:42:30
eventually they will fall down, and it will repeat itself.
1:42:35
That’s been brought to its knees by the salvage rider.
1:42:40
Unfortunately, with
1:42:45
the concern for the public, one element of the rider, which I think was just
1:42:49
awful, was bringing in these section 318
1:42:56
sales.
1:42:56
[Section of an appropriations bill permitting some logging] The [laughs]
1:42:57
industry shoots themselves in the foot most times, in their exuberance to say,
1:43:01
“By God, now we’re in power, we’ll blah, blah, blah,” and do something dumb like
1:43:06
that. It ignites the environmental folks to the point where nothing happens.
1:43:16
That rider was designed for salvage, and to bring this stuff rapidly
1:43:21
into the market, because once it gets old, its value goes down,
1:43:31
so it’s very difficult.
1:43:32
If somebody wants to stop a timber sale, there’s so many
1:43:36
levers in our system to do it.
1:43:38
These competing and conflicting acts that affect the national forests,
1:43:48
including the National Forest Management Act itself.
1:43:51
There are enough levers there that will keep attorneys busy forever,
1:43:55
and can bring anything to a halt.
1:43:59
I mean, by God, anything.
1:44:00
If somebody doesn’t want something to happen, there are levers there to pull
1:44:07
that some judge will make a judgement again that, he probably didn’t
1:44:10
have enough information here.
1:44:12
[Laughs]
1:44:14
So, the salvage rider had at least brought to some conclusion that
1:44:24
the environmental efforts of the Forest Service brought to bear on this particular
1:44:29
project, is sufficient to meet the act.
1:44:32
And that’s not a good way to run a railroad, I guess.
1:44:34
But,
1:44:38
because of all the hoopla, it almost
1:44:48
becomes necessary.
1:44:48
The environmental folks say it is logging without laws.
1:44:51
Well, baloney!
1:44:52
I know better.
1:44:54
In fact, the Warner Creek, that whole thing, went through environmental
1:44:58
statements, it was reviewed for, gosh sakes, by everyone, on and on and on.
1:45:07
And it preceded the salvage rider.
1:45:11
So then, the salvage rider comes along, and these folks
1:45:14
go out and protest [laughs].
1:45:17
That’s frustrating.
1:45:19
For Jerry Franklin and the research group up at the Andrews, there
1:45:24
has been a magnet for a lot of public controversy and discussion.
1:45:30
Alston Chase’s book, In a Dark Wood, for example, if you’re familiar with
1:45:37
that, was an attack on the whole concept of ecosystem management.
1:45:41
No, I haven’t read that.
1:45:42
I was just curious, because that book and its analysis of what they were
1:45:48
doing there, this attack on their work there, seems at odds with this
1:45:51
partnership you’ve been talking about.
1:45:53
I’d have to read the book, I guess, to react.
1:45:57
But here again, you have that continuum of
1:46:04
a
1:46:07
philosophy of ecosystem management on the one end, you
1:46:30
have folks who feel strongly that mother nature ought to be the
1:46:31
sole manager of these forests.
1:46:31
That humans have no part in it.
1:46:31
On the other end of the spectrum, you have folks who feel that humans have a
1:46:34
strong role, always have and always will, in how these forests ought to be managed,
1:46:41
and their view of ecosystem management is much different than these folks over here.
1:46:50
I’m more on the side of the view that the forest, this ecosystem we live in,
1:46:59
humans are a very strong part of it.
1:47:03
I would guess you have scientists on that same end of the spectrum,
1:47:07
scientists who feel very strongly that they shouldn’t be doing anything.
1:47:11
And on the other side, scientists that feel that, with the knowledge
1:47:14
that we have, that we can
1:47:17
do a better job.
1:47:21
I would guess there
1:47:24
were probably some scientists up there on the staff that hold those views, and as
1:47:30
they articulate those views, people pick up on whatever they want to hear, I guess.
1:47:36
Well, there’s some interesting questions that we have here about this shifting
1:47:42
public attitude towards research.
1:47:44
Bob Buckman, who was involved with the PNW Station
1:47:48
-- Yeah, I know Bob.
1:47:51
He mentioned before in a previous interview, his idea of personalities
1:47:57
of people, of getting the right people together and working together, can lead
1:48:00
toward that kind of a paradigm shift.
1:48:02
Sure.
1:48:03
And at another level, you can see the natural forces at work, public
1:48:09
sentiment, building up a knowledge base.
1:48:13
How would you characterize the relative weight of those forces
1:48:18
as far as what was going on at
1:48:22
the Andrews?
1:48:22
During my stay, you mean?
1:48:25
Yeah.
1:48:26
I don’t know what’s going on there at the moment, but
1:48:36
I thought they were
1:48:38
bringing a group together, including National Forest management people, to
1:48:45
listen to one another and interact, and transfer information and
1:48:50
knowledge to make things work better.
1:48:55
That was my notion.
1:48:58
What do you think brought that group there?
1:49:00
What were some of the forces at work there?
1:49:04
Well, as I mentioned earlier, we were developing these standards and
1:49:10
guidelines that were going to drive the forest for the next 10 to 15 years,
1:49:16
and there was a sense of urgency.
1:49:18
[Complete the Willamette National Forest plan of] I wanted the best science
1:49:20
we could get to help formulate those.
1:49:24
And I wasn’t alone.
1:49:26
I think the regional forester wanted that.
1:49:29
The chief wanted it, and here we had an opportunity, because of the
1:49:33
Andrews being right here on the Willamette, and representing our forest
1:49:37
situation pretty well, to have the ability to take that leap forward.
1:49:46
So, there was probably some stimulus there, too.
1:49:48
Rolf [Anderson] , not only was the liaison with the Andrews, he was
1:49:52
also my principle staff in-charge of the forest plan, and so, there
1:49:59
certainly was a desire on his part.
1:50:04
I don’t know what was guiding the scientists.
1:50:11
I could sense that, you know, God Almighty, they were putting on more
1:50:14
tours and more tours and more tours.
1:50:18
My sense was that, at least to some of them, this was a royal pain in the rear.
1:50:23
It
1:50:25
was taking them away from what
1:50:29
they probably felt was their strongest suit, and that was to do more basic
1:50:36
research, do more studies, or whatever.
1:50:38
Yeah.
1:50:39
In fact, I’ve heard them articulate that in kind of a [trophy]
1:50:45
model, by the end of the ‘80s, why, by God, both Blue River
1:50:49
and the Andrews were conducting,
1:50:53
I don’t know
1:50:57
how many tours, but hundreds of them, and I don’t know if
1:50:58
that’s stopped by this point,
1:51:05
but probably hasn’t.
1:51:05
Let’s see, this tape is probably close to the end here.
