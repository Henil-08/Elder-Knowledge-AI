00:00
I’ve been trying to sort these out is to have people talk a little
00:00
about their academic traditions they come from and the pathways that
00:00
brought you to this point to get
00:23
here.
00:24
I usually end
00:32
up starting out with people’s formal
00:37
connections to the institutions here.
00:42
My
00:46
understanding is that you came here in 1956, and you joined
00:49
the OSU faculty in, what, 1982?
00:51
It wasn’t faculty, it was staff.
00:54
Staff?
00:54
Okay.
00:54
I was a civil-servant technical-scientific editor for the [OSU] College of Forestry.
01:02
They wanted a civil service exam required, and then, it was a half-time
01:06
job advertised as a half-time job because
01:18
they thought nobody could process [publications] more than
01:18
half-time, that it was too intense.
01:18
They had very few half-time positions in civil service, but they specifically
01:24
designed it [that way] . Now, when I edit, I put fifteen hours in,
01:29
nobody says anything about that.
01:31
It is too intense [editing work] . When did you started doing that?
01:35
It wasn’t in the 50’s, it was about ‘64.
01:47
Now, I see your degrees are both from [University of] Illinois.
01:48
Both from Illinois, yeah.
01:51
Bachelor’s in botany and a minor in zoology and a masters, actually it was
02:00
marine botany, not very close to forestry.
02:02
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your
02:07
personal special mentors up until the time you came out
02:14
to Corvallis here.
02:14
I mostly took classes in ecology as an undergraduate.
02:21
At that time, ecology was two separate entities; there was
02:25
animal ecology and plant ecology.
02:28
Professors in the two departments didn’t even talk to each other
02:32
much, and they disapproved of each other’s philosophy of science.
02:40
I
02:43
tended to agree more
02:52
with the botanical side.
02:59
We went out looked for oaks and hickories together, beech and
03:04
maples together, and all that stuff.
03:07
We knew exactly what we were going to find out there.
03:11
The botanical side professor, well, one of his favorite sayings was,
03:18
“Fellas, plants are where you find them.” And his name was Arthur Gibbs
03:21
Bestall, and we all adored him.
03:23
What’s his last name?
03:26
Bestall.
03:31
He
03:33
was very good with students, but he never published, or published very little.
03:46
Marine botany was Paul Silvum, who came from Berkeley, a very inspiring
03:52
teacher, and I got interested in marine botany from going to Friday Harbor
04:03
[Lab associated with UW] at the University of Washington.
04:06
I had no knowledge, no interest, particularly in forestry, but I was
04:12
very busy in the 60’s doing all sorts of civic good things, and I was on the
04:20
board for the League of Women Voters.
04:23
The woman who was president was going on sabbatical with her husband to
04:29
Russia, and she said, “Why don’t you take my job for a year?” I didn’t
04:32
know what her job was, but she was an editor for the OSU College of Forestry.
04:38
I said, “No, I don’t know anything about that.” And she said, “You’re
04:41
a good writer,” because what I did for all these civic organizations
04:44
was their public information.
04:46
I wrote radio scripts and performed them, and wrote all kinds of brochures and guide
04:54
books and press releases; all that stuff.
04:57
She said, “And you’re also a scientist, and that would help you.”
04:59
I think she was a history major, and
05:07
I found it was an ideal job for me because it was half-time,
05:10
and I had four small children.
05:14
They never knew I worked, because I went to work after they
05:20
went to school and I got home before they got home.
05:23
And I had a wonderful teacher there.
05:27
The man who was “the” editor for the College of Forestry then called the
05:32
School of Forestry, was Jim Overholtzer.
05:36
Overholt?
05:37
Overholtzer.
05:39
He was a forester by training, had a gift for
05:44
words, and was a very ethical, caring, contentious man.
05:52
He monitored my editing for about the first two weeks, and
05:57
then he just turned me loose.
05:58
He said, “You know just as much as I do.” I didn’t, of course, but it
06:02
was nice for him to say so. Within about a month, he said, “And you
06:05
should get this job when I retire.”
06:10
But then, I was recruited by the Forest
06:14
Service.
06:16
They had big money.
06:19
It wasn’t the
06:21
Forest Service, but
06:25
really the Department of Agriculture.
06:27
Ken Wright ran that program.
06:32
We were sort of on assignment for the department, but the Forest Service handles
06:37
the money and paperwork, what they call an IPA [Interagency Personnel Agreement] . I
06:42
still work for Oregon State, officially.
06:46
How did Ken run things?
06:51
Do you know?
06:52
Well, my husband was in the OSU Entomology Department, and someone in that
06:54
department knew me and knew what I do.
06:58
They told them about me and told me about the job, so when they
07:03
called, I knew what it was about.
07:06
It was to be a job in Portland [PNW Station] . They kept saying,
07:10
“You’ve got to understand, you’ll have to go to work in Portland.” At
07:14
that point, I had two teenagers
07:18
at home still.
07:18
I talked to them and my husband,
07:22
and I said, “What do you think about that?” They said, “Go for it.” I went up
07:22
to the interview, a horrifying interview.
07:23
There
07:26
were twelve men sitting around a table, twelve
07:35
people
07:37
I had never met.
07:38
Personnel people, and what is it, assistant directors, the director,
07:39
the head of administration.
07:43
When
07:47
I left the room afterwards, George Hanson, who was the station’s editor
07:51
followed me out the door, and he said, “They’re crazy if they don’t pick you.
07:55
By far, you’re the most qualified person who applied for this job.” That’s
07:59
how I got into the Forest Service.
08:02
After that job interview I was to go with the college, but PNW Station Director
08:11
Bob Tarrant decided I should stay
08:17
with
08:20
the Forest Service.
08:21
He didn’t want to upset the Forest Service and the university [OSU] , so he went down
08:25
to see the dean [OSU-COF] and asked the dean if he could have me.
08:26
The dean said it would be a good experience for
08:34
me, and he was right.
08:35
I negotiated not to have to go to Portland.
08:40
It would be silly for me to have my office up there when
08:50
most people I needed to work with were in Corvallis.
08:51
Who were some of the people that you worked closely on
08:52
that project at that time?
08:53
Well, none of them are here.
08:55
Well, Gary Daterman is the only one that’s still here.
08:59
Roy Beckwith, Boyd Wickman, Sid Mason, Hank Thompson, Torgy Torgerson, Bob
09:23
Campbell,
09:25
and then later on in the program, Rob Stark.
09:31
Then the
09:36
three of us, Bob Campbell,
09:42
Rob Stark and
09:47
I, are the ones that coordinated the book.
09:47
And the book was very well received.
09:49
We had a wonderful team.
09:51
[Bob] Buckman, who had been [UfSFS] Associate Chief for Research, kept a copy
09:57
of it on copy paper in his office, and gave them away, and these people would
10:04
say, “Oh, beautiful book.” One of the
10:08
earliest, I think, of the Forest Service coffee table
10:13
books.
10:15
Some
10:18
people started moving into this building from the OSU Forest
10:21
Science Department and the lab.
10:30
Is that right?
10:37
I didn’t know there
10:42
was such a thing as a Forest Service “research room.” I knew about the
10:43
Andrews, but I didn’t know about this.
10:44
I found out there was such a place when I was offered a job, and they said I
10:50
could have an office here [Corvallis] as well as an office in Portland.
10:52
Starting out, they were going to let me work
10:58
one day a week down here, and four days a week up there, and then,
11:01
a little bit later, they said it could be two and three, and
11:03
then, it could be three and two.
11:04
By the end of it, I spent one week working full-time
11:14
in Portland.
11:16
At that time, this building was the big part.
11:20
That was the earliest.
11:23
Then the middle section
11:27
was completed by the time I came in ‘77 and then, they had
11:32
started building the new wing to the west [Phases of USFS
11:32
Forestry Sciences Laboratory]
11:45
. I paid no attention to
11:50
this thing until I started working.
11:51
Were you aware of the Andrews before you started, before you were involved with it?
11:55
Yeah.
11:55
I worked at the College of Forestry and there were a lot
11:56
of cooperative things going on.
12:00
Some of the papers and particular events and symposia I had to edit, would be
12:06
people from the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station [Later
12:10
simplified to Pacific Northwest Research Station] . I didn’t know where that was,
12:16
but I did know about the Andrews because a lot of the people over in our
12:28
Forestry Research Lab were working with people at the
12:32
Andrews, and they talked about it.
12:34
It’s a wonderful place, doing good work, and then, after I came
12:38
over here, I met all these people.
12:43
Then, as we progressed closer to
12:54
the present, I got involved a lot in tours for foreign visitors.
12:59
I was supposed to be in charge of all foreign visitors.
13:03
Washington [Forest Service office] would send me a notice to set up a tour for
13:09
distinguished people from China, or for the Russians, a delegation of Finnish
13:11
foresters, or whomever else came in.
13:11
It appeared to me, particularly for the three years when I was social
13:12
officer, what was exciting and what was influential, was that a great deal
13:12
of it was coming from the Andrews.
13:12
Also, as
13:38
long as I’ve been here,
13:42
one thing that has bothered me, is that my husband’s department and the
13:45
entomologists here [USFS Forestry Sciences Lab] didn’t know each other.
13:51
People here didn’t go to departmental seminars, people over there didn’t
13:54
know the scientists over here.
13:56
I thought this was lunacy.
13:57
The whole reason for building this lab
14:00
here is for connections with the university, and the ability to interact.
14:06
I set up seminars and had people from this lab come over to
14:10
give seminars for scientists at OSU Department of Entomology.
14:13
I baked cakes and pies and cookies.
14:17
I think that’s why they came, but at least they were talking to each other.
14:21
When there would be a seminar speaker, I would post notices so the people
14:24
here would know about them, and then run around the offices and ask,
14:28
“Who’s going to the seminar?” and force this Forest Service attitude on
14:34
them. A couple of people complained about going to a seminar, and
14:41
I don’t think
14:52
the government would approve of me going to a seminar not directly
14:54
related to the Forest Service.
14:58
What was the time frame when you started setting up those seminars?
15:02
I think shortly after that, I became a “real forester.” You know,
15:07
after the one-and-a-half years
15:11
of
15:18
doing this
15:25
work. I’d have a speaker come for an evening program, and I would have all
15:33
of the people from both the departments – forestry and entomology – together,
15:35
so they would get to know each other.
15:36
It worked
15:39
for
15:48
a little while.
15:48
I’m curious here from your background at Illinois and since you’ve been
15:51
involved, how would you characterize the potential for interdisciplinary
15:57
exchange between the university here and [Forest Service researchers] when you
16:06
started working for the Forest Service?
16:11
One always assumes universities are set up in ways detrimental to
16:20
interdisciplinary interactions.
16:22
I noticed recently, I’m on some mailing list for the botany department and the
16:28
zoology department, and they’re at least notifying each other about seminars.
16:30
There’s often an awful lot of overlapping interests, and they seem to be sort
16:30
of reaching out to other departments.
16:30
It’s really a pretty new thing.
16:39
I suppose in part
16:46
because
16:53
of my academic background, I took entomology and lots of zoology classes
16:58
and botany classes, and even some biology.
17:03
I would read the papers, even back when I worked in the College of
17:05
Forestry, and see connections [or
17:16
lack thereof] , and realize that scientist “A” had never read the
17:22
paper about scientist “B,” and they were very closely-related.
17:30
They appeared to be building houses in their models,
17:35
and in the next 100 years the ecologists said that they wouldn’t grow, and
17:37
the ecologists were running around trying to find places to study real
17:50
forestry with real people.
17:51
I think both groups have gotten over that now.
17:55
When I was at the OSU College of Forestry there were three departments: a [forest]
17:59
products one, a science one and an applied research one [forest management] . Now,
18:05
there’s a fourth one, in recreation, but there were economists there and
18:10
just a whole array of disciplines.
18:14
Certainly there were barriers between the departments that didn’t seem to get
18:20
solved very often, but it seems to me that I was excited when I came to the Forest
18:27
Service, because I thought we don’t have
18:36
deans and departments and things like
18:43
that in the Forest Service.
18:43
I then began to think the fact I was an ecologist by training,
18:49
pushes me in that direction.
18:51
I’m seeing the connection between
18:56
the kinds of experimental programs that people are trying to find out the answers
19:01
to the questions, and I see where this question relates to that one over there.
19:08
I spent a lot of energy introducing people.
19:12
I would take people and ask do you know so and so?
19:15
I think you would be very interested in the work he’s
19:16
doing, and get them together.
19:18
I did that a lot.
19:20
Sometimes it worked a little bit, and sometimes it didn’t.
19:25
I did more formal things, like when we put on a big program where we invited faculty
19:30
from the University of Oregon to come
19:35
and talk.
19:35
We had a room full of economists and biologists of
19:40
all kinds, and the dean of forestry from Oregon State and the dean of
19:45
forestry from the University of Washington; all in the same room.
19:47
We had them for lunch, the economist gave a talk on his perspective on owls
19:54
and logs and the Northwest economy, and then, after lunch and the talk, we were
20:00
still in Peavy auditorium, and everybody came back and talked for four hours
20:06
about how the disciplines fit together, and the social components of what
20:15
we are doing in the forest.
20:18
I got lovely letters, one from Fred [Swanson] , and one from Richard Haynes
20:20
[PNW Station forest economist] . One of them called me the “Mother of Integrated
20:24
Forestry,” and the other said that I set a new standard for meetings in
20:30
forestry.
20:35
But I’m not sure an awful lot came of it, because people are much more comfortable
20:42
at working in their own department and speaking their own language, and were
20:48
a little more secure in what they know.
20:53
It’s dangerous out there on the edge.
20:58
Would you say that OSU is any more or less effective in
21:02
inter-disciplinary work, other than universities, that you are aware of?
21:06
I don’t know there’s not a roof, well,
21:16
maybe evidence that a lot of this stuff is going on.
21:20
I mean, until people get past the idea that if you have a meeting and
21:25
a lot of flip charts with people in other disciplines, that comes to
21:28
“interdisciplinariness.” It’s a step in the right direction, as you talk to
21:33
each other, but it doesn’t have a great deal of meaning until you really absorb
21:39
it and actually work together on it. I don’t get to do that a great deal.
21:48
I
21:53
once put on a great big party with people in natural history,
21:59
physiology, entomology, zoology, botany and geography.
22:02
We had all
22:12
kinds of activities.
22:14
They got to know each other, graduate students and faculty.
22:17
There must have been 300 people there.
22:19
But it’s just the idea that we all have interests in common, and if we don’t talk
22:28
about what we are interested in with each other,
22:32
we can’t move forward.
22:35
In Illinois they had a place called the Bavarian, and
22:40
it had
22:43
the ecologist and
22:50
fisheries people.
22:57
That group had a more congenial and interdisciplinary culture.
23:00
They have to look at more things than someone like themselves.
23:06
But
23:16
I think ecology has changed so much
23:26
since then.
23:26
They are really joint exercises, and
23:33
what I think of is that the object of all that is that
23:35
studies are designed that cross
23:40
disciplinary boundaries; and we don’t
23:46
do a lot of that.
23:47
You said that when working as an intern doing these papers, you
23:53
tried to be aware of the Andrews.
23:56
What was your first impression of what was going on at the Andrews, at that point as
24:01
you started reading through the papers?
24:03
What kinds of things were catching your attention?
24:08
Well, the big one of the big things was the, even then,
24:10
controversy over clear-cutting.
24:10
When was that?
24:11
The ‘60s into the ‘70’s.
24:21
[s-on]
24:28
People were saying things like
24:33
it’s the only way to manage Doug-fir; that kind of thing was coming out
24:47
of the universities.
24:47
As long as the clear-cuts had irregular boundaries, they looked natural,
24:56
and it was okay to grow a monoculture, because it had no diseases and no pests.
25:14
I think the whole environment of the universities at that time was
25:21
very much centered on those ideas,
25:26
and the students there had come to learn how to “grow boards.”
25:33
As soon as the whole Vietnam War thing developed, you could tell
25:45
who the engineers were and who were the foresters on campus,
25:49
because the way they dressed.
25:50
There were conformists and there were people on a mission which was set, and
25:53
they did they did a good job of it.
25:58
A lot of publications had words like
26:04
“decadent” and “over-mature.” It just always seemed
26:20
to me like why don’t you just come out and say, “It’s cheaper
26:22
if you cut all the trees at once.”
26:31
Have you heard a lot about that language?
26:33
Yeah, and you
26:39
think of the generation of forestry students that were
26:48
taught with that
26:54
terminology.
26:58
Those
27:02
people are in the positions of command in
27:06
forestry all over the country – the ones that were taught that way.
27:13
No wonder there is now a rift between the people who trained that way, and
27:20
then, the group of students who came in later with much more of an ecological
27:26
perspective and interests much broader than just than they are only trees
27:37
to harvest.
27:37
How would you characterize the stuff that you were seeing coming from
27:40
someone just working on the Andrews?
27:45
I can’t tell.
27:46
My memory of time, and what I’ve read at different periods in my
27:50
life, are really hard to separate.
27:52
I do remember at some point, saying, “Yeah, this is more like it.”
28:03
Allen Berg was an innovator
28:10
in the [OSU] College of Forestry.
28:13
He was an innovator in everything in his life, and was a good friend of mine.
28:18
He did
28:24
a lot of
28:36
things up at Black Rock [forest management research area in Coast Range] . One of
28:39
the science experiments was done with planting hemlock, which is considered
28:42
a weed by the rest of the group.
28:47
He did long-term studies.
28:55
So, it’s hard for me to separate
28:58
the stuff that came from him.
29:00
Every year he did a young-growth management seminar and there were
29:02
little inklings of [concern for managing for Douglas-fir monocultures] . Maybe
29:12
we’ll start having problems with insects and disease if we don’t learn to plant
29:19
anything else, and maybe not every place should be clear-cut, because regeneration
29:24
studies have been talking about [failures to establish the next forest]
29:31
. Dr. Berg ought to take a look at where that tree is doing well and the way
29:36
that forest will be talked about [in the future] . There’s a big difference
29:42
between forestry in Illinois and Oregon.
29:45
We don’t have trees
29:50
in Illinois.
29:52
This is an enormous leap for me to come here.
29:54
In Illinois, people burned coal in the fireplaces, because
29:57
it’s easier to get that than it is to get fire wood.
30:00
We don’t burn wood in the Midwest; we worship it, cherish it,
30:07
we carve it if it falls down.
30:12
Theoretically Illinois is in the
30:19
north-central forest zone.
30:24
There were little groves of trees, like in Southern Illinois
30:29
where the glaciers didn’t touch.
30:33
We had to go quite a distance on ecology field trips to get
30:36
into anything like the forest.
30:38
We had a little university forest outside of town about the size
30:45
of, I wouldn’t even say a big hill, in Montana.
30:45
That would be too big.
30:45
A wheat field in
30:50
Illinois.
30:50
I remember going out there when it was 12 degrees below zero,
30:54
digging under a tree and finding a whole colony of invertebrates.
30:58
I couldn’t believe it, it was like 10
31:04
pounds of weight
31:08
that was on it.
31:13
The thing about the forest here is that they’re all around
31:20
us.
31:20
It took a long time in Oregon to recognize
31:30
the beauty of the forest.
31:37
For a long time, they had long corridors along the roads so that you couldn’t see
31:43
through them to the clear-cuts beyond.
31:43
You didn’t fly out of Portland in an airplane because you have all that
31:46
cutting going on Mount Hood, right?
31:48
And I think one of those things that pushed people’s interest in a more
31:55
ecologically-gentle approach was the airport coming in and out over Mount Hood
32:00
and seeing it change before our very eyes from solid green, solid forest to what
32:10
looked like hedge rows in England, and
32:13
corridors of trees.
32:14
I guess my strongest connection to the Andrews really was earlier, when Jerry
32:28
was
32:36
talking about distributing clear-cuts [minimum-fragmentation cutting]
32:37
. Richard Herman used to talk about how we had finally learned not
32:49
to cut steeper and all that kind of stuff, and the terrible problems they
32:52
had in the Coast Range with scotch broom.
32:54
Back then, people did all this stuff and it took them a while to
32:56
recognize the effects and deal with that and realize that doing it is
33:06
a problem in the first place, doing it to that extent.
33:15
And then Jerry came with his [New Forestry] thing.
33:17
He seemed to be saying, I am the one that needs to straighten these things out.
33:23
It
33:28
finally dawned on him that once
33:35
you completely clear-cut, then you have no continuity.
33:38
I can remember his presentation, the first week of presentations, he
33:44
had a map of future
33:49
cutting sites, and he had huge photographs.
33:53
Well, he’s even gone beyond that now, he’s done so much.
33:53
Well, it sounds like you’re saying that Jerry Franklin was the first person you
33:53
worked with that was directly connected to the Andrews and their standing?
33:53
Well, I guess he is.
34:10
I
34:15
know I’ve
34:19
worked on papers before his, that I know.
34:57
Back up one minute here.
34:58
I want to ask you to talk a little about the decisions
35:02
you made to move out to Oregon
35:07
from Illinois, where both you and your husband got your degrees.
35:15
Right?
35:16
Yes.
35:17
He’d never been west.
35:19
He wanted me to make the decision, and I did not want to make the decision.
35:20
The decision should be for the professional; what’s good for you.
35:20
For one thing, it was 3000 miles away
35:25
from
35:27
his
35:39
mother,
35:42
but
35:45
I don’t think that’s relevant.
35:45
I loved Oregon, I’d been here several times before, and my
35:53
old boyfriend who was from here.
36:03
My honors thesis for my undergraduate was a comparison
36:07
of alpine plants from Bolivia,
36:13
Diamond Peak and
36:18
the Canadian Rockies.
36:19
My boyfriend brought me to Oregon.
36:25
We camped on the coast and camped at Crater Lake, and I
36:29
was hoping he’d choose here.
36:32
He chose here, I think, mostly because Philadelphia said we have no positions,
36:38
and if you come here, there’s no chance you are going to get a job.
36:39
In Oregon, the [OSU] Department of Entomology had no physiology,
36:40
and so, there was a possibility he
36:51
could
36:56
teach a class and it might turn into a real job.
36:59
He went to something called the Science Research Institute, which
37:03
was biochemistry, biophysics,
37:05
and physiology, all together.
37:13
That was a wonderful place to work, it was just great and he did get a job
37:22
in the entomology department, but it had nothing to do with trees or
37:42
anything really.
37:44
Maybe I could ask you about your first impression about the Andrews.
37:52
So beautiful, it is so pretty.
37:56
I can see why
38:03
forestry people wanted to have it, and I can see why it’s been treated with as much
38:09
as respect and delicacy as it has been.
38:11
You know, they are certainly often under pressure to hack it
38:21
to bits, and yet, they were very conservative with how
38:23
they dealt with the land.
38:26
Certainly Roy [Silen] was the pioneer in laying out roads away from the streams,
38:37
during the early stages.
38:39
They treated it as a cherished part of the experiment station.
38:46
Can you remember the
38:53
occasion
38:55
that you first went down there?
38:55
First time down there, I went on a sort of a “show-me trip” with Fred.
38:57
Carl Stoltenberg [Dean-OSU College of Forestry] was there, and Stan Gregory.
38:58
They stopped at a lot of places where they were doing work, talked about
38:59
it, stood by streams and talked.
39:00
Beautiful day, they picked a beautiful day.
39:00
They are very
39:23
good at picking beautiful days.
39:25
There were just little trailers there.
39:28
There was no kind of real facility.
39:31
Sort of heaped together.
39:33
I’ve made four or five trips since then.
39:36
One of the big things they used to do here,
39:39
is they
39:44
did nice things for employees.
39:47
They’d get a bus every year,
39:51
and take, maybe that was the first time I went, they would take the secretaries
39:56
out, and everybody that worked here that wasn’t going to the Andrews, could
40:00
go on this bus for a day, have a sack lunch, and drive you and show you around.
40:06
It was sponsored by the station [PNW Station] here?
40:10
Yeah, I think it was.
40:15
It may be unnatural.
40:16
There
40:20
used to be sort of a community that isn’t here anymore.
40:24
We used to have an employee community raise money from the Coke machine,
40:29
and they would have a watermelon feed.
40:31
Well, a lot of that stuff I organized.
40:35
They would have Christmas parties, Halloween parties,
40:41
stuff like that, out of money raised.
40:42
But they don’t do that anymore, we don’t even have an employee fund.
40:47
Nobody was willing to serve on it.
40:52
What’s your recollection of Fred and Bob [Griffiths] and
40:58
Stan Gregory, on field trips?
41:01
It must have been after Jerry left.
41:07
Would it be the 80’s?
41:09
No, I think Jerry had left.
41:12
I went later, on one where Mark Harmon told about big logs,
41:19
how they are trying to keep the insects out [with netting] , and let the log rot.
41:26
To learn what is the role of the insect.
41:30
And they talked about how hard it was to get the logger to part
41:48
with
41:58
this perfect log.
41:59
They expressed that point-of-view, too.
42:00
I thought it was fascinating.
42:01
And then, Art took me out and showed off the new building.
42:04
I always loved to go, as I always learn something whenever I go.
42:08
It’s a beautiful place and beautiful to me for its intellectual
42:15
contributions, such as the way it was.
42:18
If Norman [Anderson] was here, we’d have outdoor laboratories accessible
42:19
to scientists from everywhere.
42:19
A big thing was IBP.
42:20
That made a big difference down there.
42:20
Dick Waring, in the College of Forestry, was prominent in IBP.
42:21
So that was a real shot in the arm.
42:22
How
43:01
do you characterize the interaction of scientists involved in research at the
43:05
Andrews with other scientists in terms of interdisciplinary involvement on campus?
43:15
Well, in
43:18
more modern times, the “Stream Team” has a big Andrews focus, and that includes not
43:23
just
43:28
fisheries biologists, but also hydrologists and people interested
43:43
in aquatic insects, like Norman Anderson. All these people work
43:43
at the Andrews. There’s a lot more
43:47
interdisciplinary stuff going on now than when I was trying to get the entomologists
43:54
just to meet the other entomologists.
43:57
This is the group that included the fisheries people, like Howard
44:01
Horton, and of course Howard is one of the people who’s gotten started
44:03
as an undergraduate on the Andrews.
44:04
And he’s a
44:08
fisheries
44:18
person.
44:18
He was fun to talk to.
44:20
As someone who had tried, in the past, to stimulate that kind of interdisciplinary
44:28
activities, why would this team have more success with doing that?
44:35
I’ve always thought that one of the reasons why biologists tend to be a little
44:40
more social than, for example, economists or sociologists, is that biologists
44:51
went on field trips and they were cool.
44:55
If you sit around a campfire and drink beer, which is at least it
45:00
was the way it was at my school, we went to the Indiana Dunes.
45:04
That was a big deal every year, we would go to the Indiana Dunes.
45:06
We also went to a lake in Tennessee for a week.
45:11
You’re with these people every day for a whole week.
45:13
At the dunes, we camped out, and lived in cabins with screen doors.
45:24
You cook out, you carry heavy equipment and you slog around in the
45:29
mud and then you bond, you really do.
45:32
You have to count on each other, and you have a lot of time together
45:37
on this bus going down there, and you talked about everything.
45:41
A lot of the times we talked about what’s wrong with your discipline
45:45
or how we could do a better job of understanding ecosystems.
45:48
It was just
45:51
what we do together.
45:53
So, I think that gives you a kind of push in
46:05
the right direction.
46:06
And I think a lot of it is in whoever is in charge.
46:11
You know, if you have somebody who has the mind-set that I’m more important than
46:21
you are, I will tell you what you need to know, rather than someone who pulls
46:28
observations out of the good intentions.
46:32
And I think it’s good, if you’re lucky enough to get somebody with
46:40
curiosity.
46:41
I think that people are, no matter what titles they have or what
46:51
degrees they have or what different schools they came from, they may
46:56
have just as good ideas as you do.
46:57
The Andrews has selected for that sort of person.
46:57
Jerry was one.
46:57
Fred is
47:25
certainly one.
47:25
Art McKee is also.
47:31
They’re authoritative, and they just
47:38
have contagious enthusiasm.
47:40
They are excited about what they are doing, and that’s a
47:43
wonderful environment to work in.
47:45
It makes people want to contribute and want to be part of
47:50
it.
47:50
I think Jerry started
47:54
it, meetings that they have twice a week, but Fred carries them on,
47:58
people come and they learn and they
48:01
interact.
48:02
I think a lot of it is persistence.
48:07
They just keep working at this, they care about this.
48:11
I think they do that because they thought they could
48:19
do even an even better job.
48:22
I think it takes a rare scientist to recognize the social component of science.
48:28
They think of it as intellectual process and they don’t realize [the
48:34
human dimension] . You read The Double Helix, and Jim Watson talks about
48:39
the real breakthroughs coming when they are standing in the [tea room] debating
48:43
about someone waiting to get their cup filled, or they are at the pub after
48:47
work drinking beer, that’s when the ideas flow and the creativity is maximized.
48:54
I think when people are relaxed and comfortable, those leaders have been good
49:00
at creating that kind of environment.
49:03
Putting students in it, that’s another
49:08
component of the mix that adds a lot.
49:11
People are all doing stuff, and they start to know each other’s ideas
49:16
after a while, but the new people
49:28
come along and it makes it move and sort of boil.
49:31
I’ve watched them in field and I’ve
49:40
seen the enthusiasm, you know, being emotionally connected with
49:42
what excited about, they are.
49:45
They don’t hide it.
49:48
What are your views of Jerry’s departure?
49:48
Well, I know there was obviously a big shock to everybody when Jerry left,
49:48
and there were a few that were a little concerned about how Fred would do in
49:48
the leadership role, because they do have very different personalities.
49:48
Fred’s very gentle and he doesn’t like to tell somebody that their all wet.
49:48
That doesn’t bother Jerry,
50:21
and
50:27
he is
50:33
more forceful.
50:33
I think
50:44
there
50:58
was concern that Fred might not be able to deal with people that weren’t
51:02
pulling their weight or that he
51:15
would not be as forceful as Jerry, but he’s not.
51:17
He came to realize that one can’t weigh down a group with non-producers;
51:23
it goes against the grain.
51:26
He’s a very sweet man and it makes it hard for someone extremely
51:31
nice to ease out the people that,
51:39
you know, don’t fit, that don’t work well.
51:42
I’ve never talked to Fred about what ever prompted
51:50
that.
51:50
What has kept them from getting the book done?
51:54
[HJA Synthesis volume]
51:58
I can’t tell you, I really can’t tell you.
52:15
It was before Jerry
52:53
left.
52:53
And what
53:01
this guy
53:08
was doing was, he made this career for himself around getting
53:19
groups to work together, which is certainly a good objective.
53:32
It’s just that, I think, almost any group of scientists would find any place to be
53:42
uncomfortable.
53:44
But what I thought they were worried about,
53:50
was the problem of getting that they all felt they had a message about
53:55
old growth they wanted to get out.
53:59
And a message about managing forests.
54:02
There were components
54:05
of that message that worked in soils and through water and birds
54:12
and mammals so that you need an expert on all these topics.
54:21
You would need all these experts to write this book, and that wasn’t happening.
54:25
And they thought maybe they wouldn’t be comfortable together.
54:29
And I said, “Jerry, this is
54:34
idiotic, you guys are a team.
54:36
You guys work
54:43
together; you
54:49
trust each other, so there should be no problem trying to decide which one person
54:55
or two people or maybe three people are the best writers and have them develop
54:59
the framework for the book, write the book and then hand it around to all
55:01
the experts, let them all review it.
55:02
You haven’t done the soils right
55:10
here or you need something about this fish or, you know, we have other measures of
55:15
water quality than the ones you’ve given.
55:18
And you’d have a book.
55:20
If you have 60 people, each one writing a little piece of it, you’ll
55:25
never get a book that tells a story.
55:26
You’ve got to a story to tell, find the best storyteller, let that person
55:27
tell the story, and you fill in the blanks.” He said, “You’re right,
55:27
you’re right.” As far as I know, that book was never written. That is
55:31
what
55:41
I think should be done, to try to get to move towards the “Andrews story.”
55:52
There have been a lot of little brochures, there have been
55:53
articles, but not the full story.
56:00
To me, one of the exciting things about the Andrews is how much
56:09
useful, valuable, informational, revealing work has come out of that place.
56:17
I think it’s done that
56:22
in part because of the place itself.
56:25
It has
56:42
so much to offer in terrain, in watersheds, great big rocks and all.
56:43
It has so much to offer as a site.
56:47
A large part of it is the people and the fact that they’ve been able
56:58
to overcome a lot of the barriers between groups, and barriers between
57:02
cooperation among scientists.
57:02
I mean, scientists tend to be very
57:11
lethargic
57:16
and
57:19
not play well with others.
57:23
Not that group.
57:24
That’s what I said
57:28
in an essay I wrote about Fred in June; plays well with others.
57:31
That’s what’s in their being and in much of society, the ability to work
57:31
with other people and synergistically
57:42
produce a great deal more than any extreme man could have produced
57:53
on his own.
57:53
It’s interesting that you describe Oregon State University as not
57:55
being unusually congenial at doing this work [interdisciplinary] . The
58:00
PNW Station certainly is not.
58:01
We both mentioned IBP as
58:06
a critical point, but, the IBP had other components all over the
58:10
country where it didn’t produce.
58:13
What you are saying it sounds like, it is people, particular
58:17
people, who were crucial?
58:19
A lot of it is particular people, and in part, it is a particular place.
58:24
It’s accessible to go from here to there, and it’s sort of a magnet to people.
58:33
When people are down there, they’re in their blue jeans and their boots, and
58:35
they bring along a sack lunch, sit on a log and talk, talk about what’s there.
58:41
So, the place is the contributor, not just the people.
58:42
It takes both.
58:42
From the very beginning, I’ve always thought one of the reasons
58:43
men work well down there is that.
58:43
It’s
59:00
not that they’re not competitive, particularly Jerry.
59:03
I don’t think Fred’s competitive nearly as much as Jerry.
59:03
I introduce him
59:18
to students, too.
59:20
One
59:37
of my first lodgers was one of Jerry’s students.
1:00:49
Maybe you could
1:02:23
talk about
1:05:32
how the Andrews compares to other experimental forests.
1:05:38
Well, I haven’t visited other experimental forests.
1:05:43
Have I been to any others?
1:05:46
Well, I’ve
1:05:49
been
1:05:53
to some natural areas.
1:05:54
I’ve been a small one, Greenwood Falls is an interesting place.
1:06:04
The houses are built by the WPA.
1:06:05
It’s a
1:06:18
very different environment there, a pine forest.
1:06:26
And Cascade Head is a very interesting place, but it’s
1:06:30
also on a much smaller scale.
1:06:45
There are not big acres of forest like the Andrews and I think probably
1:06:53
there’s a lot more scope for research
1:06:59
at the Andrews.
1:07:00
Lots more different kinds of things
1:07:06
you could do there, or maybe not.
1:07:07
I keep thinking about your Alaska book where you talk about when
1:07:11
Bernard went up there and was
1:07:15
warned about what a big place it was, and to keep the church close to where he is
1:07:21
so he could get to it [in time of need] . That’s almost similar
1:07:25
to the Andrews, because it’s big.
1:07:27
Ethan Abby Creek near the Burban area.
1:07:30
What’s the
1:07:36
difference there, the people there?
1:07:50
Where the Andrews is quite a drive, you know.
1:07:56
Yeah, fortieth [Andrews Forest anniversary-] . We
1:07:58
haven’t had the fiftieth yet.
1:08:00
Yeah, it was just the fortieth.
1:08:01
I thought that was great.
1:08:06
They did a really good job.
1:08:15
Well, I guess my question was, do you get a sense that
1:08:19
people view a trip on the Andrews as kind of a special experience as
1:08:23
opposed to something you do every day.
1:08:29
For me it’s always been a very special experience, maybe, because
1:08:33
it’s beautiful and I love the forest, and for a person who grew up in
1:08:36
corn fields and loves mountains.
1:08:39
I love rushing little streams like
1:08:48
the one by [the headquarters site] . It’s glorious to me to be allowed go there.
1:08:49
But it’s also the stream of intellectual achievement that’s
1:08:53
come out that thrills me.
1:08:56
That’s one of the reasons why it’s so special to me.
1:08:58
I don’t know what other people feel about it, but
1:09:04
it’s like going to the City of Refuge on the big island of Hawaii.
1:09:07
That
1:09:11
is a beautiful place, but it also has this aura about it, because of the
1:09:18
antiquity of uses of the land, and shelter for the people who are being pursued.
1:09:24
It’s like focusing on
1:09:29
this as a very special
1:09:33
piece of land and it carries something of
1:09:37
an ancestral
1:09:39
use
1:09:43
for the place.
1:09:43
It becomes part
1:09:47
of you.
1:09:48
I think
1:09:51
the fact that the Andrews is
1:09:56
sort of a trek from here
1:10:02
could have been
1:10:05
a deterrent, but apparently, the people who started out pioneering
1:10:11
down there didn’t seem to mind staying in motels in Blue River or camping
1:10:18
out or staying in rusty trailers, because they don’t dwell on that.
1:10:24
They made jokes about it and laugh about it, but they don’t really check.
1:10:34
It’s a little hard to explain.
1:10:38
But,
1:10:40
I think it is less of an ordeal to go down there now, because you can stay there.
1:10:46
For scientists, I mean, their labs are right there now.
1:10:49
They can go down and I’m not sure that that any more creativity or any
1:10:54
better science is going to come out of that, but it’s just more convenient.
1:11:01
A lot of changes happened.
1:11:04
I
1:12:07
was wondering, around that time, obviously, you’ve seen some
1:12:11
scientists come into the station.
1:12:15
The
1:12:18
young faculty come in, some getting tenure and some not.
1:12:23
I was wondering, in this culture,
1:12:28
what are the implications of that
1:12:33
for young scientists, as far as how much
1:12:43
you’ve seen?
1:12:46
Gosh, I have not
1:12:49
registered.
1:12:53
I know there are people who have been here, like Chuck Grier, who is
1:13:00
now at the University of Washington.
1:13:05
He was at a civil rights meeting I went to
1:13:12
Dallas, but he was IBP.
1:13:16
There are quite a few people here for a while that aren’t here anymore.
1:13:21
Oh, I didn’t know that.
1:13:23
Scary thought.
1:13:24
My son tells me that he has hanging on the wall in his living room his trumpet
1:13:26
from when he played in the marching band.
1:13:27
What does his brother do?
1:13:28
I don’t know.
1:13:28
I have no idea.
1:13:29
But he is extremely competitive.
1:13:31
[May be speaking about Dick Waring]
1:13:37
He has done a lot
1:13:51
of
1:13:54
really good
1:14:01
work.
1:14:10
I
1:14:22
worked
1:14:37
on his paper with Russ Mitchell on tree stress and the
1:14:44
inability of trees to fend off insect attacks because they
1:14:48
were under drought-stress.
1:14:49
Very good
1:14:53
work.
1:14:53
This is another of my introductions.
1:14:55
I got Dick Waring and those people connected with the people at LaGrande.
1:15:06
They did a bunch of studies together and published.
1:15:07
The papers they published were because of me; it’s very nice.
1:15:19
I tried, when I was in the OSU College of Forestry, because they were the people
1:15:20
I thought I would be connected with.
1:15:21
But the up side is
1:15:31
that they
1:15:33
are so much more
1:15:41
friendly.
1:15:42
You can connect with them.
1:15:43
They were more amenable to it.
1:15:43
It might not have anything to do with the university environment.
1:15:43
Culture, would be people see it as something to be positive
1:15:43
for a career and afterwards?
1:15:48
Yeah, I think it’s coming.
1:15:54
I mean, because
1:16:02
people
1:16:15
talk
1:16:23
about
1:16:27
it
1:16:34
a lot.
1:16:37
Almost everybody says, “Well, for years, people thought it was a good
1:16:40
idea, but not me, not me.” You know, I don’t want to think about it.
1:16:47
But your stuff earlier wasn’t that the people were hostile to the idea,
1:16:51
it was that they didn’t see that they were going to be involved.
1:16:52
I think they didn’t see any reason for it.
1:16:52
In my line of work, I don’t have
1:17:02
credentials.
1:17:03
I don’t have a Ph.D. I’m not a professor.
1:17:09
I’m not a scientist, labeled a scientist, so it’s taken me a lot of years to
1:17:15
get the credibility that you need to really [interact] . Every scientist
1:17:23
whose paper I’ve worked on in which I had found something embarrassing that
1:17:28
would have been published – like a
1:17:36
mathematical error I found, a misquotation or anything that saves
1:17:42
them from embarrassment – they become true believers and then I
1:17:45
can say to them, you really ought
1:17:50
to read.
1:17:51
It’s like you said, every paper I’ve ever worked on.
1:17:56
Nobody can [be perfect]
1:17:58
. Not any of mine.
1:18:00
Not any of yours?
1:18:03
No, none of mine.
1:18:05
Oh, I’m so glad, it’s very heartening.
1:18:07
I was going to say, it strikes me that you’re the one
1:18:11
communicating about what you do,
1:18:18
and a lot of times, trying to get other people to communicate with each other.
1:18:23
I was curious to know; what is your assessment of how the effectiveness of
1:18:27
the Andrews group has affected them in communicating what they do to scientists?
1:18:31
How that’s changed over time?
1:18:35
What direction?
1:18:36
Well, for a long time, I don’t think there was very much effort
1:18:45
in
1:18:58
the station to worry about what ordinary people knew about the Andrews or thought
1:19:00
about it or to work at the station.
1:19:01
When I was in [the public affairs group] , I used to talk to [the
1:19:01
PNW leadership] about what I thought we could do to raise the
1:19:07
profile of the station.
1:19:08
The people who are our [clients] know about it.
1:19:10
We send out these quarterly reports and our publications,
1:19:12
so they know all our work.
1:19:15
And that was one of the first things one of the justifications [for Forest
1:19:23
Service Research] . They didn’t want me
1:19:26
to [promote the PNW Station] , it was not
1:19:33
part of
1:19:40
their agenda.
1:19:41
I think that everybody in that era pretty much agree that
1:19:50
our clients were
1:19:59
[Federal land managers] . And he said that when he came and by the end of
1:20:04
his tenure, of course, he got a lot more push at his sudden involvement.
1:20:09
That’s when he said, “That’s who our clients are.
1:20:11
We should do what they want.
1:20:13
Study what they want us to study.” I think in a way,
1:20:23
it reflected what was their general belief that, it’s nice, if you
1:20:28
have time to spare, to go to the state fair and hand out brochures,
1:20:38
that
1:20:45
kind of thing.
1:20:46
But writing promotional material wasn’t anybody’s job.
1:20:50
I’m not sure that they’re doing a better job.
1:20:54
Now, Cindy Miner’s training and entrance and background [information for
1:21:00
employees] , and
1:21:08
so I think there’s a lot more emphasis on it now on.
1:21:12
I babble on video tapes all the time.
1:21:15
They always seem to come down to do a video tape about something or other, and
1:21:22
with virtually no
1:21:31
budget.
1:21:34
It’s a little hard to compete with no funds.
1:21:36
It really is.
1:21:39
And it’s just like in the old days.
1:21:41
It used to be that someone got a projector and showed actual
1:21:44
color slides on the walls.
1:21:46
People could look at anything.
1:21:47
Then
1:21:51
they got to the point where they were doing 2 or 3 ones with music.
1:22:03
If it isn’t good quality, PBS special [quality] they don’t want to look at it.
1:22:07
I guess the people wasted money.
1:22:09
I think we seem better off when we have exciting research
1:22:15
breakthroughs, some news about where we have something to tell people.
1:22:18
You make a one-page sheet, put them on the counter in the district offices.
1:22:25
I mean, advocating all this stuff for years.
1:22:30
They think you have to put lots of color photographs and pretty covers.
1:22:31
They’re just interested if you know the research before they read and they’ll
1:22:35
read about it in the PNW Quarterly List and they’ll want to read about it.
1:22:41
It doesn’t need to be decorated.
1:22:44
I think there are probably ways it could get to the
1:22:51
public, if you
1:22:55
wanted to.
1:22:55
But, I think maybe there are books they need to be writing since the Andrews’
1:22:55
story has been told, but you need a good storyteller, you need a good story,
1:23:02
and, if it’s intended for the public, it has to be very readable.
1:23:10
It can’t be too fast, it has to be told in an interesting, and a
1:23:22
very short way.
1:23:26
They’ve got to tell a story like
1:23:30
that, or otherwise the intricacies of individual results and research studies
1:23:39
are not going to be understandable.
1:23:43
That’s
1:23:51
what I’m talking about.
1:23:55
But, if we do have a story to tell, it’s only a story, if we know the context.
1:24:04
The problem is that, for one thing, there isn’t a person who knows all of it.
1:24:11
And the
1:24:16
little bits and pieces that are published as the result of individual studies, don’t
1:24:25
often make sense.
1:24:27
Those papers are out there and they could read them, if they wanted to.
1:24:39
We
1:24:42
don’t reward people who waste their time taking other people’s original bits and
1:24:49
pieces, putting it together so it tells a story, so it has a meaning, so it gives
1:24:52
direction to what you want it to do.
1:24:56
It isn’t put together, it doesn’t tell you how to manage your land.
1:24:59
It only tells you that, if you put fertilizer on a little
1:25:04
tree, it will grow faster.
1:25:07
It doesn’t tell you what it will do to the other plants, the animals, or,
1:25:12
if you fertilize it, you’re reducing [something else] . You do the same
1:25:15
thing next year, something else or nothing, because they never go beyond
1:25:18
what they just tell you a little piece.
1:25:21
Expecting the people in the wide world to read those things is unrealistic,
1:25:29
but to be able to see how they fit together, what concepts lead you to say
1:25:36
you can do this, but not if you do that,
1:25:42
we don’t exactly know.
1:25:45
There was a program, they had a research coordinator, an applications coordinator,
1:25:52
whatever they called the head guy.
1:25:55
They had someone else called the integration coordinator, a person who
1:26:00
was very good at writing review articles.
1:26:05
He was also a highly productive scientist, as he would turn out 5 or 6 papers a year.
1:26:10
So, if he wanted to take a few weeks to write a review article,
1:26:15
it didn’t bother anybody.
1:26:16
They put him in as an integration coordinator and
1:26:18
I thought, what a funny term,
1:26:23
but what he did from the beginning of the program all the way
1:26:24
through, was make people talk to each other his job, make them
1:26:30
talk.
1:26:32
Wherever he saw an overlap or a chance for pulling something together, he put
1:26:38
up signs saying, “You talk to so and so and work out who’s going to do what
1:27:46
now.”
1:27:54
And in the end we had
1:28:07
a magnificent book.
1:28:10
So,
1:29:42
what
1:30:09
you’ve been
1:30:12
saying here is that until very recently the Andrew’s group has
1:30:15
not been particularly successful in communicating what they’ve been up to.
1:30:20
Well, from my point-of-view, I don’t know.
1:30:24
Maybe they feel
1:30:27
successful.
1:30:27
I helped them write some brochures.
1:30:33
I just don’t think it’s ever been a high priority for them.
1:30:41
They do have a very high priority for engaging visitors viewing the
1:30:51
science in the works at the Andrews.
1:31:00
Doing the kinds of things that we do at the Andrews, we could do
1:31:03
them in China, we could do them
1:31:30
in Russia, we could do them all over the world.
1:31:32
I think that they concentrate a lot on
1:32:00
the educational role
1:32:00
. We were talking about the communication efforts of the Andrews.
1:32:05
What would you identify as some of their more successful efforts to broaden
1:32:10
the range of their target audience?
1:32:13
I think one thing they did was really good was that birthday celebration.
1:32:16
They brought in a whole lot of people
1:32:20
from all over, congressional staffers, industry people, scientists
1:32:25
from other places, and deans.
1:32:27
They had both deans from Washington and OSU,
1:32:33
and because I was a public affairs officer, I was considered a VIP.
1:32:41
They had us to dinner and had us stay overnight before they had facilities
1:32:46
to house people on the Andrews, but we stayed overnight at some Catholic Church
1:32:52
retreat center that was wonderful.
1:32:57
It’s literally it’s on the river and it looks like the river is
1:33:02
flowing underneath the house.
1:33:06
It’s so beautiful!
1:33:06
Where was that?
1:33:08
It’s somewhere near there.
1:33:09
I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s a gorgeous place.
1:33:17
They had a nice dinner, they had breakfast the next day, they housed
1:33:21
us all and it’s nice they had a
1:33:26
meeting where they had chairs, folding chairs, in a great big
1:33:30
room, and we had a guided discussion
1:33:38
about the
1:33:42
Andrews, to get to know each other better
1:33:49
so they would be comfortable talking.
1:33:50
I didn’t do much talking, but it was a real nice
1:33:58
idea.
1:34:05
They have had
1:34:09
meetings more recently down there where people come and talk about things.
1:34:16
I think they had a flood meeting after the big
1:34:28
flood of 1996.
1:34:29
There is a constant kind of contact between the researchers
1:34:29
and National Forest people.
1:34:29
They certainly have been looked upon benevolently by the forest supervisor.
1:34:30
I don’t know about the current one or
1:34:52
whether
1:34:54
the current one has that feeling.
1:35:00
If you think about the National Forest system as the client,
1:35:04
then any information you get
1:35:14
[is a plus]
1:35:14
. I’ve got one more question, one more major question here.
1:35:18
One more question.
1:35:18
Well, I talk too much.
1:35:18
How would you characterize the difference between basic and applied science?
1:35:19
That’s very interesting because that certainly blurs.
1:35:20
There’s hardly anything that they aren’t interested in.
1:35:20
Anything that we find out is potentially useful to forestry, so
1:35:27
it’s hard for
1:35:30
me to draw a line.
1:35:31
Other people do, like Andy [Moldenke] . You still talk about
1:35:33
earthworms, earthworms are good.
1:36:49
They are
1:36:54
good for your garden.
1:36:54
They dig around and they do things.
1:36:56
Well, then, they show you exactly how much soil they
1:37:03
process and if you multiply it per individual, you get this huge
1:37:09
figure and you go, oh, my gosh!
1:37:11
Well, there are many more [examples] than there are earthworms, but
1:37:17
nobody really knows what they all do and what would happen if they all quit,
1:37:23
went on strike one day, they don’t know.
1:37:28
Yeah, and trying to distinguish
1:37:41
them.
1:37:41
I went right to it.
1:37:42
Here you go.
1:37:43
[Looking at a publication by Andy Moldenke on mites of the Andrews
1:37:45
Forest] You should see these
1:37:48
pictures in here.
1:37:48
I’m going to give you 10 minutes to look at this page full of
1:37:53
[illustrations of mites]
1:37:57
. These are the major types, they’re not species they’re just types
1:38:02
and it goes on and it goes on.
1:38:04
Good grief!
1:38:05
And there are these electron microscope pictures.
1:38:11
These are all different.
1:38:12
Are you seeing the differences, as you go through?
1:38:14
Oh yeah.
1:38:16
We have nice drawings of them so that you can really see the differences.
1:38:19
One interesting thing to me about this publication is,
1:38:24
not only does he have all the mites he captured,
1:38:31
but a bunch that ought to be, he’s included them in there so
1:38:35
someone later on a committee can find one that ought to be there.
1:38:46
Isn’t that incredible?
1:38:46
You think of that as basic research.
1:38:49
This makes a lot easier to add it to the morphology.
1:38:50
To the bits and pieces, yes, it helps.
1:38:51
That’s pretty straightforward.
1:38:51
But
1:39:03
that’s when I got the angriest I’ve ever been at Karen Esterholdt
1:39:07
[PNW Station editor] . She wrote the nastiest letter to Andy.
1:39:13
Andy’s graduate student took all the photographs, the
1:39:14
graduate student graduated.
1:39:17
We were supposed to pay the graduate student for the photographs, so
1:39:22
Andy paid him out of his own pocket.
1:39:23
Then Karen thought, because he
1:39:39
didn’t follow PNW rules, she said really mean things about him, and
1:39:45
they don’t usually do such things.
1:39:45
But I took it and showed that letter to [higher authorities] , and I said this is
1:39:48
important enough to me that I discarded my lifetime commitment to not tattle on
1:39:51
people, but this is a matter of great importance to my husband and his partner.
1:39:58
That can cause discord between us and the university.
1:40:06
This bill must be paid, and she must not write letters like that again.
1:40:12
If she wants to yell at me, she could do that,
1:40:20
that’s fine.
1:40:21
Now she says to
1:40:26
the head communications, that I told her not to write
1:40:31
to anybody.
1:40:31
She’s much better off when she just talks to people.
1:40:42
I can’t believe it!
1:40:48
That’s what my problem is I put all these names that don’t have many faces
1:40:56
and I walk past them as I’m trying to
1:41:08
make phone calls.
1:41:08
Well,
1:43:02
it’s way too much, I have talked a lot, but
1:43:05
it is interesting.
