This is an interview with Ted Dyrness on 11th September 1996.
00:06
The interview takes place in Mr. Dyrness’s office in the Corvallis FSL.
00:13
The interviewer is Max Geier.
00:18
Time of the interview is approximately 9:30.
00:26
[Starts mid-idea without introduction or context; possible recorder issues?]
00:29
I wish I could remember the name of the temporary technician
00:33
I had working with me.
00:34
Maybe Al would remember that first year in ‘62, when we
00:41
were laying out the plots.
00:42
But, I remember telling him: “You know, doggone it!
00:46
It’s a real privilege to be able to work in areas like this!”
00:52
When we went into some of the thickets, because we had to
00:55
keep a straight transect, it was arduous, and I remember him
01:03
getting just ticked off.
01:03
We wore hard hats just
01:08
as a safety precaution for falling limbs from the old growth, and so
01:11
he’d whip off his hat, throw it down,
01:16
and he’d say: “It’s a goddamn privilege to work here!” [Laughter].
01:18
I don’t think he blamed me.
01:20
It was hot, and we were sweating.
01:22
Yeah, you get
01:40
a real sense of that out there.
01:41
Just from talking to people, no one has really been able to
01:46
articulate what attracted them to the Andrews in that sense.
01:49
Yeah, in reflecting back, we all had much wider research
02:00
responsibilities!
02:00
We weren’t hired and told: “Go work on
02:08
the Andrews!” We were attracted to
02:12
it. I was responsible, when hired by the station
02:19
[PNW] in ’59, and attached to the Alsea Basin soil vegetation survey work,
02:28
for a year-and-a-half.
02:29
Then they told me, “Your responsibility will be to research soil stability
02:34
problems on the west side of Oregon and Washington.” In the summer of ‘61, I
02:35
went--usually with Jack Rothacher, who was my boss--on a tour through the west-side
02:36
national forests [west of Cascade crest to Pacific Ocean] to ask them what
02:36
their soil stability problems were, and
03:01
what they felt contributed to them. This was in preparation for writing
03:07
what we called a “Problem Analysis.”
03:13
My responsibilities were supposed to be
03:18
region-wide.
03:20
But at the same time, I was thoroughly up on what was going on in the
03:25
Andrews, because when I first met Jack Rothacher, my boss, he was living
03:34
there.
03:34
He was the first really bona fide hydrologist
03:39
that the PNW Station hired.
03:44
Do you know about when he was hired?
03:46
He must have been hired in 1959 or 1960.
03:48
Well, you know you can get all this from records, probably.
03:51
He
04:01
even lived down there!
04:02
And that was about the time you met him.
04:05
I met him down there before we started working together, because I went down
04:12
in the summer of 1955, and actually, most summers, despite the fact I was
04:19
supposed to be working on the Alsea Soil Vegetation Survey in the Coast Range.
04:20
I had friends, and I remember one summer, Art Wollum was hired to
04:20
do soil survey work on the three small watersheds [HJA-EF] . He was
04:20
a fellow graduate student with me
04:35
under
04:42
Chet Youngberg in the Department of Soils on campus here [OSU].
04:51
I remember going and visiting him.
04:53
That was way before the
04:58
Blue River Reservoir
05:02
was built and there was a famous swimming hole in Blue River.
05:07
It was after Lookout Creek dumped into Blue River, in the main valley,
05:14
which is under the water now.
05:16
There was a big swimming hole called the “Lucky Boy” swimming
05:21
hole. We went swimming when I visited Art. He was in that “famous”
05:26
8 foot by 30 trailer up above the ranger station [Blue River].
05:31
In fact, he was the first one to live in that.
05:33
It was brand new then!
05:34
I said, “You know,
05:37
Art, at least you have a brand-new place to live.”
05:44
We went swimming, and I jumped off a high log that was there by the swimming hole
05:51
onto an air mattress and jammed my knee. To this day, I have had one surgery and
05:55
need another! [Laughter] Gosh!......And to this day I limp because I’ve put it off.
06:02
Let’s see, that must have been
06:06
‘59 or something like that.
06:08
Had you been up there before when you were in graduate school?
06:12
You were here in ‘54 to 60, right?
06:14
Right.
06:15
The first time I went to the Andrews, I remember like it was yesterday, was
06:21
in connection with a field trip, one of
06:28
the two-week field trips after the Soils Science Society of America’s annual
06:34
meeting in Davis, California, that summer.
06:37
I think they now have
06:40
it in the fall.
06:41
But then, it was the summer of ‘55.
06:46
I had been a grad student here [OSU] a year -- I came in fall ’54
06:54
-- so I had been a grad student in soils for a year before the Davis meeting.
06:59
They always encouraged grad students to go to the annual professional
07:03
meetings to see what they are like.
07:08
I didn’t give a paper or anything, but I attended that meeting, and then,
07:12
afterwards, somebody had organized this grand, glorious tour through
07:19
northern California and Oregon.
07:22
I think it lasted a week, maybe a week-and-a-half, with guys
07:28
like Bob Tarrant, Chuck Colton,
07:34
Chet Youngberg
07:39
and also, people from California.
07:44
For a young grad student, it was a tremendous opportunity to learn
07:50
from these people in the field.
07:51
At that time, there weren’t that many in the field of forest soils.
07:51
Stan Gessel, who recently passed away, was likely there.
08:00
Chet Youngberg is now
08:07
feeble
08:11
and
08:16
forgetful.
08:16
[Indicated declining health, desire to visit.] Plus, one or two others.
08:23
Was Keith VanCleve in that group?
08:25
No,
08:30
this was before Keith started his graduate work.
08:33
We went
08:42
to places like Clear Lake in northern California, looked at a lot of soils
08:46
and talked to the people that were doing the real pioneer work in soil vegetation
08:52
surveys in California [Wieslander?]
08:59
and Bob
09:11
Nelson.
09:11
Most of these guys have passed away by now.
09:11
Do you have Bob Tarrant on your list of people to talk to?
09:12
Yeah.
09:14
So we went to Crater Lake.
09:15
It was great, and included the “pumi” [pumice] country on the east side,
09:21
and Pringle Falls [experimental forest] . One of the last stops
09:25
before we got to Corvallis where the tour ended, was to the H.J. Andrews.
09:35
That was the first time I had ever seen the Andrews.
09:38
I remember being really impressed.
09:40
The
09:42
system was really new,
09:46
and I saw one of the first clear-cuts.
09:51
Remember the main road into the Andrews?
09:54
You go past the three small watersheds, you wind up the hill,
09:58
and then there’s a Y [in the road].
10:02
To the left is the concrete bridge, and further up to Carpenter Point.
10:06
To the right, you go up to Lookout Ridge.
10:10
Right by that Y, was one of the early clear cuts.
10:16
Uh-Huh.
10:16
One principle stop on that field trip was to visit this clear-cut, where
10:24
we were met by Roy Silen, who was doing research for his Ph.D. thesis.
10:28
He was
10:36
investigating the effects
10:42
of how naturally-germinated Douglas-fir seedlings survive or
10:48
don’t survive; what are the factors.
10:55
They were really into converting old growth forest
11:04
into second growth stands, so one thing they were most interested in was
11:11
regeneration of
11:14
tree species.
11:16
Back then, it was before they determined that maybe the best thing to do would
11:25
be to just routinely plant areas; they were investigating natural regeneration.
11:35
This was back before they had a lot of forest nurseries, and so
11:41
he was investigating, especially, the effect of high temperatures
11:48
on these exposed south slopes.
11:51
He had black surfaces after slash burning.
11:55
Really prime for getting high temperatures.
11:58
What he did was put out these temp pills, which were little pills
12:06
you could buy, which melt at a range of different temperatures.
12:11
So, if you go back and say, “Well, the 120 pill is melted,” you know it was
12:18
at least 120 [degrees], but maybe the
12:23
130 pill isn’t melted. That’s what he was doing.
12:26
Later on, Roy’s interests shifted quite a bit.
12:28
He
12:35
was the forest
12:39
geneticist here at the Forest Research Lab.
12:44
But his doctorate research was more
12:50
horticulture-oriented.
12:54
A lot of the early work was done at the same time by a fellow
13:02
named Jay Gashwiler, who was investigating natural regeneration.
13:10
His
13:13
approach was to follow
13:19
Douglas-fir seeds and
13:23
see what their fate was.
13:27
A large proportion of seeds scattered from the surrounding timber to
13:36
a clear-cut site are consumed by different animals, especially
13:42
small mammals and birds.
13:43
His approach was, “What are the most important factors of limiting
13:51
sufficient seed for natural regeneration?” He had a bunch of plots
14:01
where he would have some fenced-in areas which would exclude small mammals, but
14:10
wouldn’t exclude birds, and some that excluded everything except the seeds.
14:20
It was really elaborate!
14:21
He
14:24
was working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
14:33
Service.
14:33
That work was reported on finally in Ecology.
14:37
Subsequently,
14:43
Jerry Franklin moved in with his clear-cut strips of different widths in
14:52
lower elevations on the Andrews.
14:54
[Experimenting with “alternative” patterns of cutting]
14:56
He would have been there in ‘55, wouldn’t he?
14:58
No.
15:02
He did this work in about ‘59 or ‘60; it was for his masters, I believe.
15:15
But, prior to that, Jerry got started on the Andrews, because
15:20
he worked for what was then called the Corvallis Research Center,
15:29
the offices of which were in the basement of the old Peavy Hall.
15:36
He started working for them when he was an undergrad at Oregon State.
15:42
The center was a part of OSU?
15:44
Or?
15:44
No, it was part of the PNW Station.
15:47
Okay.
15:50
Back then,
15:53
I worked out of the Bend Research Center, the summer of ’58; it was a summer job
16:04
back then.
16:04
All these research centers; there was a Roseburg, Corvallis and Bend one,
16:12
and
16:15
each of them had
16:18
a committee of interested people that would advise the
16:24
centers on their research.
16:32
Jerry started when he was young.
16:35
He
16:37
didn’t even have his masters by then, did he?
16:39
But of course, you’re going to talk to him, and he’s going to remember
16:44
this a lot better than I do.
16:45
He was working for the Corvallis Research Center and was sent
16:52
out to the H.J. Andrews to make periodic stream measurements.
16:57
They
17:00
had these three gauged watersheds with recorders, and nobody locally
17:10
at Blue River really worried much about it, so they kind of did
17:16
that [monitoring] from Corvallis.
17:19
There are old pictures of Jerry measuring stream velocity, but that didn’t
17:27
end up being Jerry’s main interest.
17:30
He was doing this as a job, and he never did go far into stream
17:36
hydrology as an academic pursuit.
17:41
He was up there doing
17:44
that already in the late ‘50s?
17:46
Yeah,
17:51
we started working together, really hand-in-glove, on the
17:59
vegetation on the Andrews, in ’63, and that was after he had done
18:13
these strip clear-cuts.
18:13
Up until ’62, my
18:19
interaction with the Andrews was on a periodic basis.
18:23
It wasn’t until the summer of ‘62 that I spent most of a
18:28
field season at the Andrews.
18:30
The reason for
18:33
it; we knew that starting in the winter of ‘62/’63, the treatments were to
18:41
be applied on the small watersheds [WS 1-3 at HJA] . My concern was that
18:52
nobody knew much about upstream [areas] from the gauging
18:56
stations on these watersheds.
18:59
They were kind of being viewed as “black boxes,” although Art
19:03
Wollum did some soils work.
19:09
Art was
19:13
never a soil mapper before that, and his efforts, although useful, didn’t
19:14
really produce a definitive soil map for
19:24
the watershed.
19:27
But outside of his work, there was nothing done upstream, really.
19:32
I thought we needed to really
19:37
get set for the revegetation following the logging of those watersheds, so I had
19:47
gotten hot on establishing these transects and putting plots along the transects
19:53
on the areas to be logged in Watershed 3, which has three clear-cut patches.
20:00
On Watershed 3, the idea was to first put in roads -- two roads -- and then
20:06
follow the effects on water quality.
20:10
Then,
20:13
after that, clear-cut harvest, about 25% of Watershed 3.
20:20
Then, Watershed 1 would be totally clear-cut, and Watershed 2 would be
20:30
left as the control [not cut] . The treatment was slated to start,
20:37
but what happened was that the that the clearing method in Watershed 1 was this
20:45
Wyssen Skyline crane, which had not been used very much in the U.S. up until then.
20:52
It was a Swiss system, and they had used it with small logs.
21:02
Generally speaking, you don’t have much timber the size of old-growth
21:05
Douglas-fir in Switzerland!
21:08
So, the system was always breaking down.
21:13
They’d break cables.
21:14
It’s
21:16
a system that has the donkey, the power source, at the top, and then
21:24
stretched a raised cable to the landing at the bottom of Watershed 1.
21:31
What would happen is the brakes would fail and they, I think, broke more than one.
21:36
Hell, more than one a day,
21:40
runaway trains of logs, going into the landing, and everybody
21:43
is running for their life.
21:45
[Laughing].
21:45
So the logging on Watershed 1 took
21:55
‘63, ‘64, ’65.
21:58
It was really frustrating for us, because we had expected to be able to go back
22:03
the next year after the logging was done,
22:07
but it was so dangerous, we couldn’t even go close to the watershed.
22:12
They started on the north slope, and the routes of these skylines
22:17
slowly worked their way south.
22:23
Finally, the logging was done and the slash burned -- I
22:26
believe by the Fall of ‘66 or
22:31
’67.
22:32
That is all in the records.
22:33
Who was the administrator -- the official -- who would have made the decision to do
22:37
the logging in the three watersheds, then to actually do the logging?
22:41
I was sitting here this morning trying to think, because
22:48
there wasn’t a full-time hydrologist in the Station and
22:53
until they hired Jack Rothacher.
23:00
These watersheds were gauged way back in the early ‘50s,
23:08
and they must of gotten people to visit from, maybe Coweeta, other
23:16
Forest Service watershed study areas,
23:25
to help set them up.
23:28
There must have been somebody in the Station,
23:33
but my memory is not good enough to say who.
23:40
I’m trying to figure.
23:40
I was talking to Roy Silen yesterday, and I think he was talking about
23:45
the Oregon Fish and Wildlife about who was working up there in ’54.
23:48
I wonder if they were
23:50
-- ? No.
23:51
Fisheries work would have been different from
23:56
this.
23:56
This was a classic, paired-watershed approach.
24:00
With a paired-watershed approach, you have a control watershed and a
24:08
treated watershed, side-by-side, then
24:15
measure stream flow for a period of several years to calibrate the control
24:24
and the to-be-treated watershed.
24:27
Then you treat the watershed
24:33
and assess the treatment’s effects.
24:41
This was the approach used at Coweeta [Georgia] and subsequent
24:47
to that, at Hubbard Brook
24:50
[New Hampshire] . I think the earliest was at Wagon Wheel Canyon and Frasier
24:53
Experimental Forest in Colorado.
24:55
So,
25:01
do you know who was involved in doing that at Coweeta?
25:05
A fellow by the name of Wayne Swank worked in Coweeta.
25:11
He has been there forever.
25:18
I bet you, Jerry will be more knowledgeable than me on the origins;
25:24
who installed the flumes and the measurement capability of each watershed.
25:35
Maybe Wayne would be the guy to talk to; the
25:44
name Hoover
25:47
sticks in the back of my mind,
25:53
but I can’t remember his first name.
25:58
When Jack [Rothacher] came aboard in ’59 or
26:04
60, whenever he came aboard at the Station, he was the one that said,
26:13
“O.K. We have enough calibration as of ’62, we can treat the watersheds,
26:20
and we’ll be able to tell what the treatment effects are.” It was probably
26:32
Jack who said what the treatments will be.
26:36
That’s Jack Rothacher?
26:37
Yeah,
26:40
Yeah.
26:40
Actually, that’s one of
26:47
the things I’m trying to get at here.
26:49
Maybe we could back up here and have you talk
27:00
about how you found yourself doing summer
27:03
work
27:05
out here?
27:06
Yeah, that goes back to the summer of ‘51.
27:06
You mentioned that you were in a chicken coop up in the shadow of Mt. Rainer?
27:07
Yeah.
27:07
Packwood, Washington.
27:08
Summer of ‘51.
27:08
How did you wind up
27:11
there?
27:13
My best buddy through
27:17
junior high and high school was this guy by the name of Ed Snider.
27:19
Ed had
27:28
an uncle that was an early settler in Packwood [Wash.]
27:37
. His name was also Snider.
27:39
There’s a Snider Mountain named for them in Packwood.
27:43
He had
27:46
a little ranch right outside of Packwood, and he’d left his land to several of
27:54
the Sniders, one of whom was Ed’s dad.
27:58
Well, Ed’s dad kind of bought out the others.
28:08
So, we’d finished our freshmen year of college and thought it would be
28:13
a neat lark to go out to this ranch and live on the ranch for the summer.
28:21
What we did was,
28:25
we knew the guy in charge of transportation for U.S. Gypsum Company,
28:31
and they routinely bought cars in Chicago and shipped them to salesmen in other
28:42
areas in the U.S., but mainly to the West.
28:47
They would let you deliver these new cars, and they would
28:53
even give you some gas money.
28:56
So,
29:00
we got a new Chevy and started out, and of course, we wanted to hit
29:05
all the national parks on our way.
29:07
We went to Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain National Park, and so on.
29:09
When
29:20
we were near Steamboat Springs, Colorado, we were on this
29:29
gravel road because of construction or something, and a guy came out of this
29:34
bend in the road, and whacked into us!
29:38
We were over as far as we could go without going over a thousand foot drop below us.
29:45
It’s very mountainous, and he side-swiped us!
29:49
This kind of ruined the aesthetics of the car.
29:51
[Chuckles] It drove all
29:55
right, and I think we
30:00
called the
30:02
police, but to make a long story short, we cut our trip a little short, because
30:08
we were thinking of going to Glacier
30:15
[National Park] on the way through, and we didn’t go.
30:17
We stopped at Coeur d’Alene [Idaho] because his dad had left a car there
30:20
for repair, an old black Buick from
30:28
the 40’s.
30:28
Ed picked up the Buick and I drove the other car, and we went to Packwood.
30:32
Lo-and-behold, the neighbor had rented out the house to some old rodeo
30:40
“buck-a-roo”. I remember he had a lot of saddles and stuff. We couldn’t
30:46
get into the house, so that was why we ended up in this chicken coop!
30:54
Well, this coop had gaps this wide between the boards, but we made it livable.
30:58
We had two cots, we had a camp stove
31:03
and a little stove to cook on.
31:10
Then we took the car down to Seattle.
31:13
[Laughing]
31:15
I remember walking into this place, “Hey Sam, your new car is here!”
31:20
Well, we had a little problem,
31:25
and the whole side was caved in. I think we had to even go in the other
31:31
door to get into the driver’s seat.
31:35
Yeah, one of the most embarrassing things [Laughs].
31:40
But then, we
31:43
had that old Buick and that quit, because the spark plug
31:47
fell out, and it over heated.
31:52
Really,
31:59
it was a terrific place for two young guys.
32:04
We never had one job; we changed jobs all summer.
32:10
First, it was
32:14
haying for this Seattle dentist who had kind of a ranch out there, a summer place.
32:21
And neither of us had worked on a farm.
32:23
We were driving this tractor and raking the hay and stuff.
32:27
And we tried to make square corners.
32:29
We didn’t know what we were
32:33
doing, but it was great, though.
32:34
He
32:39
got a baler to come in and bale it.
32:44
That was a little bit of income to keep the “wolf from the door,” so we could eat.
32:50
Then we went to the lumber mill, a community kind of a lumber mill
32:55
that I think, is still going.
32:59
I remember, I
33:03
got a job there, and they said, “What’s your social security number?”
33:07
and I said, “I don’t have any social security number.” So, I had to get it
33:11
in Olympia, Washington.
33:12
I never had one, now kids get their social security cards the day they are born.
33:21
The government has to have that number, but I didn’t get a number until then.
33:24
So, what we did was pinch-hit for guys that had to be off work.
33:30
We worked on the green chain, I worked on a trim saw and we were milling
33:40
cedar, western red cedar.
33:42
The trim saw happened to be right next to the head rig.
33:48
I didn’t think to put ear plugs in or anything like that, and I suffer
33:48
from “tinnitus,” this ringing. Well, that’s probably not the sole cause
33:48
of it, but it is probably one cause.
33:50
I didn’t know what
33:55
I was
34:06
doing on this trim saw.
34:08
It was just a bare revolving blade that you pulled, and I was always afraid that I
34:13
was going to cut off my hand or something.
34:16
This was before OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration]
34:20
, and they wanted to cut out all the knots and make clear cedar lumber.
34:26
It was my job to cut it to predetermined lengths, and we had these “dogs” that
34:31
would come [laughing] down. I didn’t know
34:35
what I was doing, so finally, it went past a grader down
34:42
the flow.
34:44
I was finally getting boards back, with them saying, “What
34:46
the hell are you doing up there?”
34:51
Acknowledging my incompetence, you know.
34:54
We worked a little in that sawmill, and then,
35:00
there was a forest fire.
35:04
We were in Packwood, which is about 10-12 miles from Randall, and we
35:10
heard that they were hiring people to work on this forest fire at Randall.
35:14
So, we walked, we tried to hitch a ride, but I don’t think we were very successful.
35:20
I remember walking all night to get to Randall, and they signed us on.
35:27
I had
35:30
those “engineer boots” on, those black boots.
35:35
Yeah.
35:36
Well, I had a
35:40
pair of those on.
35:40
No change of socks.
35:43
So off we go.
35:44
I was shipped out to this fire, and we were there for, oh, 10 days, at least.
35:50
My feet were a mess!
35:53
I got what was called, “scalding.” It feels like you are walking on hot coals,
35:59
because you sweat, your feet sweat, and overheat. There’s nothing to soak them.
36:05
Oh man, blisters and stuff!
36:07
I got a break, and remember taking off my boots and hanging up my socks to dry
36:13
them out, and going to the fire boss.
36:15
I said, “Gee, you know, I’m not a
36:21
quitter, but I can barely walk.” I can remember him putting an arm
36:27
around my shoulder and saying, “Son, we all want to go home but
36:31
[laughter] until this fire is out.
36:32
We can’t!!!” Finally, they called in the National Guard, and I remember
36:45
these guys from West Virginia and recent arrivals from western
36:48
Washington, and all the talk of “the
36:53
last piece of tail.” [Laughing]. Well, I’m just this naive little guy, and well,
36:59
it was a really interesting experience.
37:02
Later,
37:05
once my feet had recovered and we got back to camp, we had a friend that was
37:09
a fire lookout right next to the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area, some of the
37:16
nicest areas in the Washington Cascades.
37:20
So, we hiked up to see him,
37:23
and lived with him in his lookout for a period of days, played
37:29
cards and swapped tall tales.
37:34
This was just after the White Pass had been constructed [Hwy.] . We looked out
37:39
his window and that’s the only time that I saw this, not one scar on that landscape.
37:46
It was just terrific, and that’s when I thought to myself, when
37:50
I get done with college, I’m going to head for the Northwest.
37:55
Although I went to a liberal arts college and majored in botany, and studied as
38:04
much as I could about forests, I knew I would have to go to graduate school.
38:11
I was thinking that a program like Yale, at that time, had a graduate program in
38:21
forestry just designed for people like me.
38:25
But, I didn’t want to go east.
38:25
I wanted to go someplace in the Pacific Northwest.
38:28
So, my major professor at Wheaton College in Illinois
38:35
had been good buddies with Chet Youngberg, because Chet was a graduate of Wheaton
38:38
and they had been really good buddies.
38:41
He said, “Chet has just recently gone to Oregon State, and he’s
38:46
looking for graduate students.”
38:49
Chet put in some time with Weyerhaeuser before he went to
38:53
Oregon State [University] . He did his graduate work at the University
38:58
of Wisconsin under S.A. Wilde,
39:04
who was called, “The Mad Russian.” If you wanted to pick out just one guy
39:11
in the U.S. who is the “father” of forest soils, it would be S.A. Wilde.
39:18
A lot of people that went to other places in forest soils, came from his
39:23
program at the University of Wisconsin.
39:26
Chet would always tell these stories, by the thousands, and his graduate
39:31
students felt, “Well, I’m kind of a second generation Wilde person.” [Laughs] You
39:37
know how that goes in graduate studies.
39:41
He said this guy at Wheaton, named Doc Leady, said, “I’m going to send
39:46
you to Oregon State.” And I’m going, “Great!” I’d had this summer at
39:51
Washington, but the furthest we got into Oregon that summer was Portland.
39:57
This guy we had
40:03
met in Packwood came down to Vancouver, Washington.
40:06
There was a relative that lived there, and then, we went over to
40:13
Jantzen Beach [amusement park] . That was back when Jantzen Beach had the
40:20
ferris wheel and all that stuff.
40:23
That’s the furthest
40:26
we ended up getting.
40:26
And I remember people
40:29
we’d meet at Mt. Rainer National Park, when we explored the park,
40:34
saying, “Oh! You think this is great? Oregon is better!” [Laughter]
40:39
So,
40:44
the connection with Chet Youngberg at O.S.U., was that your professor at
40:52
Wheaton College, and he was his student?
40:52
In fact, Chet was one
40:57
of his students.
41:04
Chet had gone through the war, largely
41:23
as a flight instructor
41:28
in San Diego.
41:29
When Chet went to Wheaton, he was an older student, so he kind of budded with Doc,
41:36
who was at the time a young professor.
41:38
They
41:41
got to be really, really close.
41:44
Just one other thing.
41:45
When you were out here in 1951, was that when you were starting
41:50
out as an ancient history major, and then, you switched to botany?
41:53
[Laughter.]
41:53
Had you already done that switch, or were you thinking about it?
41:57
No.
41:57
I was just in the midst of making that decision in the summer of ‘51.
42:01
And then, it all sort of fits together in retrospect.
42:09
Although what I did when I started at Wheaton was, I thought, “Gee,
42:12
I’m no scientist.” And of course, I’d take the….What do you call
42:20
these tests you can take in the…?
42:23
“Aptitude tests”?
42:23
Yeah, something like that.
42:26
Myers-Briggs.
42:28
Have you taken that?
42:29
I would come out “intuitive.”
42:34
My thought processes are not “typical” for a scientist.
42:42
When I started Wheaton, I said, one of the requirements for a liberal
42:46
arts degree is laboratory science.
42:50
I sat down and said, “What’s the most “Mickey-Mouse” laboratory
42:54
science that I can take, and get it out of the way as a freshman?”
42:57
You know, thinking very logically.
42:58
[Laughter] And I thought, “Ah, Botany!” Well, of course, when I
43:04
got there, this guy Leady was a charismatic teacher, and it’s not
43:09
just botany, but more about ecology.
43:20
Very often what happens is it’s not the subject so much as,
43:23
it’s the guy that teaches it.
43:24
Sure.
43:25
And how he turns you on or off.
43:34
That summer of ’51 reinforced that I ought to major in botany, and
43:40
then maybe go to graduate school.
43:44
I
43:47
was thinking more in terms of general
43:55
forestry.
43:55
Chet was in forest soils, but in ‘54 when I came out here, this was the
44:03
“flowering” of the age of specialization.
44:08
Everyone is specializing, so I should specialize, a particular field of
44:09
forestry, and forest soils looked good to
44:15
me.
44:16
Although in my graduate work at Oregon State, I always had
44:21
as my second major, ecology.
44:25
So, I was always aiming towards plant/soil relationships, rather than
44:30
just soils with pedagogical interests.
44:37
I was going to ask you about that.
44:39
Have you ever thought about how or why you evolved as you
44:43
did in your interests, ecology
44:49
as a minor?
44:52
Well, in high school,
44:55
when I lived with my folks, my dad was a college administrator,
44:59
a high pressure job,
45:06
Vice President, Director of Admissions, Registrar.
45:10
What school was that?
45:11
Wheaton.
45:11
And he said I’ve got to get away!
45:17
I’ve got to get away where I’m out of the reach of the phone.
45:40
[Interruption: Enter new person [Steve Acker] . Ted Dyrness introduces Max Geier
45:42
to Steve Acker, explains that Acker is
45:46
in charge of
45:50
long-term forest
45:53
plots in Oregon, Washington and in Southern California,
45:59
and Acker joins interview.]
46:03
What’s the area you cover?
46:12
All of Oregon and Washington?
46:20
Well, the network of plots is mostly in western Oregon and Washington, and there
46:24
are some in Sequoia National Park, in California, and a few in the Rockies.
46:32
I could give you a manuscript, if you’re interested.
46:35
Sure.
46:36
[Brings Acker up-to-date on the interview Geier is doing
46:47
and the question about the origins of Dryness interest and entry into ecology.]
46:53
Where were we, now?
46:53
It is kind of interesting
46:57
to
47:00
think about.
47:01
My dad said I’ve got to have a place to get away.
47:07
We visited northern Wisconsin.
47:11
Eventually, he got
47:18
a couple of lots near a lake in Northern Wisconsin.
47:28
When I was a junior in high school, my grandfather and I
47:35
went up there and built a cabin.
47:39
Really very primitive.
47:41
It was a two-room cabin with an outhouse, stuff like that.
47:48
I really got involved with the forest.
47:52
I remember I made a trail out in back, and a place for a log where I could sit.
48:02
We were interested in identifying species;
48:09
it was formerly all white pine.
48:14
But back in the late 1800’s, early 1900’s, it got all cut off.
48:20
Back then, they thought they could maybe make it agricultural.
48:21
They’d hoped it would grow back with birch and aspen, that sort of thing.
48:30
I think that’s really the genesis, although at the same time,
48:40
I was kind of an unusual kid, for a guy especially, as I was
48:44
interested in gardening too.
48:47
I designed flower boarders and that was kind of a part of it.
48:54
I think lately, this was a kind of a direct heritage from my
48:58
mom, who was really interested in her surroundings and flowers,
49:05
but she wasn’t the kind that joined the Audubon Society.
49:09
Just being aware of the birds and everything.
49:12
My dad was into things more like fishing and going out on the lake and sitting.
49:21
Not any fancy fishing.
49:24
He would even hold the line by hand
49:29
- part of this Norwegian heritage, you know, a “wheat fishermen.” Not a real sportsman!
49:36
[Laughing] He liked to get away and have a chance to unwind.
49:41
Just growing up in Wheaton, Illinois is what kind of led you in that direction?
49:54
Early on, I said, “Gee, I don’t like it here.
49:59
I need mountains.
50:00
I need wide open spaces.” I
50:07
decided it [Midwest]
50:11
had attractions as far as lakes go, but it’s
50:18
glacial, plain terrain, with ice-locked lakes.
50:20
I
50:26
remember later in college, when we would go
50:30
for Spring Break trips, my buddies and I would not go to the beaches.
50:36
We’d go to the Smokey Mountains [Great Smokey] National Park, camp,
50:40
and wake up with snow all around
50:47
us.
50:48
Do you remember when you started at O.S.U., who else was working with Chet
50:55
Youngberg, in terms of graduate students?
50:58
Well, I was his second graduate student, so there wasn’t a great many of them.
51:02
His first graduate student was a guy by the name of Jerry Lowery.
51:09
The last I heard about Jerry, he had ended up in the pulp and
51:12
paper industry in southern Canada.
51:20
But, Jerry was doing a masters and his research had to do with
51:28
soils of the Tillamook Burn.
51:32
I remember once or twice I went with him to his sites, and helped him dig
51:37
soil pits and that sort of thing.
51:40
That was back when the Tillamook Burn [research] was still just getting going.
51:44
They still were felling the snags and kind of watching over
51:51
the reforestation progress.
51:52
Did you do any studies up there yourself?
51:54
When you were a graduate student?
51:55
No I didn’t.
51:59
When I first started to work
52:02
with this program, I didn’t even have
52:07
an assistantship.
52:07
But I remember Chet telling me, he said, “Well, come along anyway, and we’ll
52:13
get you an assistantship as soon as we can, but meanwhile, there is plenty
52:17
of work that you can do in the lab.”
52:21
I remember that I started to work for 75 cents an hour in
52:33
the lab, doing soil analysis, just helping out in there.
52:33
Hmm.
52:33
But, it wasn’t very long after that I got an assistantship.
52:38
Because, back then, most of the guys had assistantships, and you’d
52:44
get free tuition, and things like that.
52:47
I remember my first room was $25 a month!
52:56
I ate in a boarding house, Mrs. Workman’s boarding house on 7th Street.
53:01
It was a very high-tone boarding house.
53:06
Linen napkins and everything.
53:07
Retired professors ate there.
53:10
And I think that was about $35 a month.
53:13
Three meals a day and really good food, too!
53:16
[Laughter.]
53:16
Yeah,
53:19
a good deal.
53:23
When you started working for the Forest Service, was that
53:26
the year before you graduated?
53:28
In 1959, what led you into that position?
53:32
Well, the year I graduated, or when I was getting ready to graduate, I
53:43
often think that……..I filled out the paperwork for a federal job, maybe
53:52
a GS-7, or something like that.
53:57
I had quite a few inquiries.
54:03
One
54:05
was from Reclamation Service, which, is irrigation dams
54:14
and investigating irrigation soils.
54:18
I wasn’t much interested in that.
54:21
But also, I really had a firm offer to go to
54:28
Grand Rapids, Minnesota,
54:32
and work on wetlands soils.
54:37
I almost took that.
54:39
I was kind of interested in that.
54:42
That would be with the Lakes State Forestry Experiment Station [U.S. Forest
54:47
Service] . Prior to making my decision, I went to the coast and back, and I
54:57
remember thinking: “Ah, I just can’t leave this area.” In the back of my
55:03
mind was the idea, that staying here makes you a little more provincial.
55:09
But, you can get a wider experience.
55:14
I remember saying: “No, I like the Coast Range, I like the Cascades, I like
55:22
Central Oregon, and I like Washington.
55:26
I can’t leave.”
55:30
The only other offer was from the PNW Experiment Station.
55:37
The
55:40
first assignment was to the Alsea Soil Vegetation Survey.
55:48
And so, I started that in the summer of ‘59.
55:51
I
55:54
wasn’t through with my thesis, but it was just a matter of polishing it.
55:59
At the outset, I had done my Ph.D. work in Central Oregon, and I
56:09
thought: “The best position I could get would be somewhere in Bend.”
56:19
I had worked the summer of ‘58 out of Bend, so I knew the guys over there.
56:27
There was a meeting in
56:30
the
56:33
fall of ‘59,
56:36
or somewhere in there, a meeting in Klamath Falls. That’s just
56:42
when they were just setting up the Winema National Forest and settled
56:48
with a lot of the Klamath Indians.
56:52
I was invited to this meeting for input on soil vegetation.
57:00
I took the bus, the Greyhound Bus, to Klamath Falls, stayed
57:05
overnight and attended the meeting.
57:07
When I got back, I was in trouble.
57:07
I was a “west-sider. I shouldn’t have gone to that meeting.
57:07
You know, I wasn’t in “Big” trouble, over it.
57:07
Oh, you mean PNW Station was upset.
57:07
Yeah.
57:07
That was the first inkling that I would get
57:15
a west-side
57:18
sort of assignment, when
57:33
the survey was done.
57:35
Okay.
57:37
And that’s sort of the way it worked out, which in retrospect, was good.
57:43
So, you had gone down to that Klamath Falls meeting because of the
57:46
graduate work you were doing, right?
57:48
Yeah, and I was called in as kind of a consultant, because I think they
57:55
were thinking of doing some station [PNW] survey work or something.
57:59
So somebody at Alsea was concerned that they were trying to recruit you away?
58:05
I don’t know.
58:07
It’s just one of those jealousies that crop up among the different
58:15
groups within the station.
58:17
I don’t know.
58:19
So, that’s when you had a sensed that there might be a home for you in Oregon?
58:25
Yeah.
58:25
I can’t remember exactly when, but before I finished up on the “soil vegetation
58:32
survey,” it was made plain to me that I’d be working out of Corvallis with Jack.
58:45
They said, “Well, we really are in trouble as far
58:52
as-
58:52
Looking back, this wasn’t my first love, forest soils.
58:57
Like I say, it’s always been more ecology and plant relationships.
59:02
And as a credit to Jack,
59:07
he would allow me to put in those permanent plots on Watersheds 1
59:18
and 3.
59:20
Then Jerry and I started this plant community classification work on
59:27
the Andrews, starting in ’63, and that extended for 3 or 4 years.
59:32
Just grabbed extra days in the field season, where we’d get together
59:37
out on the Andrews and do this reconnaissance classification work.
59:55
That was pretty much it.
59:56
Between that summer trip you took in 1955, and this, did you get involved much
1:00:02
with the Andrews on any sites at all?
1:00:03
Were you there with other people who were working there at that time, at all?
1:00:08
Outside of a
1:00:11
few social things,
1:00:16
no.
1:00:19
I visited Art Wollum at the Andrews, and I think I had my little brother along,
1:00:22
as he was with me the summer of ‘60.
1:00:22
I took him around on weekends to show him the state.
1:00:23
He was telling me yesterday on the phone from California, after I said,
1:00:23
we’re doing a history of the Andrews Forest, and he said, “That’s interesting.
1:00:24
It is a special place!” I said, “You remember that?” Isn’t that funny?
1:00:24
So, he still remembered that.
1:00:24
Yeah!
1:00:24
In ’60.
1:00:25
That must have been summer of
1:00:35
’60.
1:00:37
And that was
1:01:24
when the trailer was new, Art was allowed to live in the trailer that whole summer.
1:01:30
And the summer of ‘61, that’s when Jack and I spent most of the
1:01:34
summer traveling around the region.
1:01:37
That’s when Jack,
1:01:40
between ‘60 and ’61, he moved
1:01:44
to Corvallis.
1:01:47
Actually, Jack lived out of Philomath on Woods Creek.
1:01:54
When we went down that time, the summer of ’60, Bill and I not only visited
1:02:00
Art, we stayed with Jack, and I remember we did a little fishing in Lookout
1:02:11
Creek, which was still open to fishing.
1:02:13
Great trout fishing.
1:02:16
Then, I think we were at Jack’s house for a barbecue, as
1:02:23
Jack and Jean have always been really gracious hosts.
1:02:32
But I don’t think then I really knew I would be working for Jack that next
1:02:40
year, because I was still working on the Alsea project, the summer of ’59, and
1:02:47
extending through winter of ‘60 to ’61.
1:02:53
Then, we worked on the “problem analysis.” [Stated before]
1:02:53
Were there major changes down there between 1955 -- the first summer
1:02:54
you were there -- and 1962-’63, when
1:02:58
you were?
1:02:58
It wasn’t major.
1:03:00
Back then, there
1:03:04
weren’t a lot of
1:03:08
people working there.
1:03:09
I remember, it is one of the clearest memories that I’ve got.
1:03:09
We were
1:03:16
looking around down there and saying, “Gee whiz. We’ve got all kinds of
1:03:21
research problems here, staring us in the face, but we don’t have enough
1:03:25
bodies! We don’t have enough guys.
1:03:27
How can we stimulate people to come down here and work?” What really took care of
1:03:35
that was the advent of the International Biological Program, which got started
1:03:49
in ’68?
1:03:53
Up until then, Jerry [Franklin] and I had not much to do with NSF
1:04:01
[National Science Foundation] . Prior to that, we were just starting to
1:04:03
get proposals to review from NSF.
1:04:07
We were just getting on their radar screen, that there are these guys
1:04:13
interested in forest ecology in Oregon, and might be good reviewers.
1:04:21
Then we heard about
1:04:26
this “gang-busters” program NSF was going to start, the
1:04:29
International Biological Program.
1:04:31
I remember Jerry said, “You know, we gotta get on-board!
1:04:37
If we don’t, we’ll just miss the boat!
1:04:39
We gotta get on-board!
1:04:42
Sure, we don’t know much about this “Systems Ecology”
1:04:46
stuff, but we can learn.”
1:04:54
[Inaudible recording]
1:04:55
Yeah.
1:04:55
We started working together.
1:04:58
I remember the time it started.
1:04:59
I just happened to be down with, with, who’s the Dean of Forestry?
1:05:10
George Brown?
1:05:11
George Brown.
1:05:11
George and I were down there digging pits and describing
1:05:16
soils on Watersheds 2 and 3.
1:05:17
Couldn’t get in on Watershed 1,
1:05:20
because of the logging under the way.
1:05:23
It was ’63, summer of ‘63.
1:05:24
And Jerry [Franklin] just happened to be down there.
1:05:29
He had cone-counts or something he had to do.
1:05:34
He said, “Let’s have dinner together tonight.” So, we went to one of the cafes
1:05:41
down there and had dinner. We started talking, “Gee, you know, a lot of things
1:05:48
are staring us in the face. And one of
1:05:54
the things is, we really don’t know
1:05:58
much about the plant groupings down there.
1:06:02
We need to get a study classifying the forest community.” The
1:06:09
previous summer the soil survey was done by
1:06:15
Freeman Stevens, Leroy Myers, and Dan Ariktoni.
1:06:19
That
1:06:22
was the summer of ‘62.
1:06:23
They were living in a trailer close to ours up above the ranger station
1:06:28
for a couple/three weeks that summer.
1:06:32
I was so busy, as ordinarily I would have gone out with them,
1:06:36
but I was so busy putting up the plots, I just couldn’t do it.
1:06:42
I used to talk to them in the evening.
1:06:43
“What are you finding, how’s it going, what series are you
1:06:45
coming up with?” and so on.
1:06:46
Jerry
1:06:51
and I, in
1:06:54
the summer of ’63 said, “We’ve gotten to know at least something about soils.
1:06:56
But we’ve got to get
1:07:00
this
1:07:03
vegetation classified.” We decided we’d do this reconnaissance study in,
1:07:10
kind of our spare time, and we did that
1:07:16
for a year or two.
1:07:17
Then finally, Jack came to us and said, “You guys got to have a study
1:07:21
plan. You can’t bootleg it anymore.
1:07:24
It’s got to be an official study listed.” And they [USFS] were
1:07:29
bears for detail back then.
1:07:31
Before you could set up a study, you had to have these approved
1:07:36
problem analyses that said, this is a problem worth researching.
1:07:40
And then every study had to have a study plan in the file.
1:07:46
I think it has gotten a lot looser since then, but the
1:07:49
policy was you had to draw up a
1:07:53
study plan back then before you could begin your study.
1:07:55
Yeah.
1:07:55
So, once again, it was a credit to Jack to recognize that what we were
1:07:59
doing was worthwhile, and I should have been working on soil erosion.
1:08:09
And Jerry should have been working on just higher elevation,
1:08:13
upper-slope silviculture.
1:08:15
That
1:08:18
was his assignment.
1:08:20
But, during that first lot, it was kind of a pioneer effort
1:08:28
in vegetation classification.
1:08:31
How to do it?
1:08:32
What kind of units to come up with?
1:08:35
Figuring out seral relationships, successional relationships
1:08:39
among the groupings.
1:08:40
Subsequent to that, the Forest Service had a lot of area ecologists that had done
1:08:49
this same thing for the national forests.
1:08:54
But I think that ours was an early effort,
1:09:02
and both of us had done that.
1:09:03
I had done that for my Ph.D. research in Central Oregon, coming up
1:09:12
with forest communities [classification/vegetation] . And
1:09:14
Jerry did his Ph.D. in Forest Ecology.
1:09:16
You are kind of getting at one of my questions there, which was: Who decides
1:09:20
was kinds of things are studied?
1:09:21
From what you’re saying, it sounds like, people out in the field, just
1:09:24
looked at the area, realized what was happening, and made a decision.
1:09:26
“Well, this is what we should do......” And then Jack Rothacher
1:09:29
was willing to back you up
1:09:37
on that. That’s kind of interesting.
1:09:38
Yes!
1:09:38
Here we had the “problem analysis” of soil studies related to forest
1:09:41
management [traditional economic-centered silviculture] . Looking back on it,
1:09:47
it would have been a mistake to follow
1:09:52
that. That’s what I mean about being grass-roots
1:09:59
oriented.
1:10:00
At the same time, I was doing studies about the impact of different logging
1:10:05
methods on soil conditions, which was more in line with my research assignment.
1:10:11
I just investigated high-lead, tractor, sky-line,
1:10:21
and balloon logging.
1:10:22
That salved my conscience a little, that I was doing something along
1:10:29
the lines of my research assignment.
1:10:35
Then,
1:10:37
I begin to
1:10:40
get interested in road-side soil stability and treatments to forestall
1:10:47
erosion on newly constructed roadsides.
1:10:52
This was also more in line with my research assignment, so it
1:10:56
wasn’t a case that we were always off somewhere in left field.
1:11:02
Sure.
1:11:02
But here again, I was drawn back
1:11:10
to the Andrews.
1:11:10
Okay.
1:11:10
All of my plots were on the Andrews, as far as the roadside erosion studies go.
1:11:14
I did have some vegetation
1:11:20
plots.
1:11:20
One plot was in the Coast Range, one was at Cougar Reservoir.
1:11:25
We were working together with the SCS [Soil Conservation
1:11:29
Service] Plant and Trails Center to identify species, especially
1:11:32
legumes, which would be suitable
1:11:38
at rather high elevations and low soil-fertility levels – which
1:11:44
would be suitable to put in a grass-legume mix for roadside seeding.
1:11:52
And then we had two areas on the Andrews where we tried out different
1:12:02
treatments, ranging from no treatment, the control, to just straw mulch, to
1:12:12
seeding mixtures, plus straw mulch, and I think we had seeding mixtures without
1:12:20
mulch.
1:12:22
And we immediately realized we needed mulch.
1:12:22
We were monitoring soil erosion with a method where we had
1:12:29
100 posts set in concrete both at the top and the bottom of back slopes,
1:12:38
which supposedly, didn’t move.
1:12:41
And then we pulled on a cable, stretched to a pre-determined
1:12:57
tension so
1:13:02
the tension would be the same.
1:13:03
Because otherwise it could be some increment more [due to the line sagging]
1:13:07
. Then we’d measure down [from the reference line to the soil surface] at periodic
1:13:11
intervals and see what the change was.
1:13:13
It was a slope profile measurement.
1:13:16
But, it never really caught on!
1:13:18
Nobody ever did it except us.
1:13:22
[Laughing] You can imagine you might have difficulties.
1:13:25
But see, the old “buggaboo” in measuring surface erosion was how do you do it
1:13:32
without changing what you’re measuring? People have tried radioactive isotopes to
1:13:43
measure it by getting radioactive particles to move, and a guy
1:13:51
in Wenatchee did that here a while ago, with some success, and we were thinking
1:13:57
about that idea. But, it’s a problem.
1:14:01
Of course, the flood of ‘64, really indicated to us what our major problem
1:14:10
was, rather than rainfall causing surface erosion, the main problem was
1:14:17
mass soil movement—slides and slumps.
1:14:17
What actually attracted you to the Andrews?
1:14:17
Was it the infra-structure, or
1:14:24
the accessibility of the
1:14:35
place, or was it something else?
1:14:38
Well, partly, it was the infrastructure.
1:14:42
From the standpoint that we didn’t have
1:14:48
any official, fancy labs or anything like that.
1:14:51
But,
1:14:56
at least we had somebody that could help us down there.
1:14:59
Because, starting with Jack, we always had somebody stationed down
1:15:07
there.
1:15:08
After Jack, it was Dick Fredriksen.
1:15:11
After Dick Fredriksen, it was Al Levno.
1:15:14
After Al Levno, it was Ross Mersereau.
1:15:20
In these kinds of studies, you need somebody to help you.
1:15:35
The reason that people needed to be there, of course, was to maintain
1:15:39
the streamflow measurements and to be there for storm flow samples.
1:15:48
Because, early on we woke up to the fact that we only needed to really
1:15:54
sample the streams during flood events.
1:15:59
Otherwise it was normal flow, and we could characterize that kind of flow.
1:16:06
But for flood events we would want to have somebody out there.
1:16:14
Since Jack lived there and knew the area intimately, he was in favor of working
1:16:24
there, and also, this was a field laboratory for the effects of
1:16:32
the floods, like the ‘64 flood.
1:16:37
And after treating the watersheds, we had questions come up.
1:16:43
For example,
1:16:46
the first summer after the slash burning in Watershed 1,
1:16:52
we were struck by how much dry ravel was occurring on these steep slopes.
1:16:58
Hmm.
1:17:00
Because, before vegetation
1:17:05
was established, you could go out on 80% slopes and just sit there and watch
1:17:14
miniature landslides caused by the
1:17:20
wind!
1:17:20
One particle would start moving, and
1:17:24
then another, and pretty soon you’ve got this cascade effect.
1:17:24
So, we would go out there and find logs on the contour, just
1:17:29
filled up with soil behind them.
1:17:31
We thought, “Boy, this is appreciable!
1:17:34
Maybe we should measure how much this is.” So, Jack and I and Al and Ross, got
1:17:42
our heads together and came up with an idea of plywood boxes held up by steel
1:17:52
fence posts with U-bolts, and then, a control area above the box down to the
1:18:00
lip of the box, with plastic to facilitate movement [soils] right into the box,
1:18:05
instead of getting hung up on something.
1:18:09
It worked pretty well.
1:18:12
We found out that
1:18:18
only a little vegetation would break the chain.
1:18:24
You wouldn’t have to have more than 5% to 10% cover, and it would break the chain
1:18:29
absolutely so that it would not occur.
1:18:32
And, 80% slopes were a lot worse than 60%!
1:18:36
And, 60%
1:18:38
was about the minimal slope you got much of this occurring.
1:18:45
We had
1:18:49
to study that.
1:18:50
That’s how things happened.
1:18:54
You just
1:18:57
would go out and observe, and say, “We ought to look into this
1:18:58
and find out what’s happening.”
1:19:01
Did the structure of the road system, at all have an impact on your accessibility
1:19:07
to the sites and your analysis?
1:19:10
Yes, as far as looking at roadside erosion and so on.
1:19:17
One thing that really appeared after the ‘64 flood was how many events
1:19:23
were really connected with roads.
1:19:26
Much more so than logging per se.
1:19:31
Roads seemed to be the main “bugaboo” in causing the mass-soil
1:19:39
movements and stream events where the whole channel would let go.
1:19:49
That was a real eye-opener.
1:19:50
That
1:19:53
was the Christmas week flood of 1964.
1:19:55
That was the
1:19:58
first time that we lost the Watershed 3 gauging station.
1:20:04
This time was like déjà vu, when we lost it again [in February]
1:20:07
. And those are the only two times that happened?
1:20:07
Yeah.
1:20:08
Those were the only two times it happened.
1:20:10
It’s been interesting to compare the two events.
1:20:13
Both were rain-on-snow at low-elevation type things.
1:20:18
And,
1:20:21
it could have been easily much worse.
1:20:24
We were looking at the records of this past one, and if the rainfall
1:20:30
would have continued only one more day, what would have happened?
1:20:33
It would have been catastrophic.
1:20:36
We got off easy.
1:20:38
It was bad enough, but we got off easy.
1:20:41
Are you speaking about the watershed, or?
1:20:42
Oh, for the whole area.
1:20:44
Yeah.
1:20:47
Because by then, the soils are saturated, the streams are full
1:20:51
already, and a cascade effect!
1:20:54
Man, oh man!
1:20:55
It just would have wiped out highways and everything.
1:21:00
It was impressive up there.
1:21:02
Yeah.
1:21:02
How
1:21:05
would you describe your level of interaction with forest managers at Blue
1:21:09
River [Ranger District] at that time?
1:21:10
At that time?
1:21:11
It was interesting!
1:21:13
Our interactions with them were
1:21:17
mainly for
1:21:22
basic accommodations, housing,
1:21:27
and to try to keep them at bay as far as logging
1:21:36
in the Andrews.
1:21:36
I wasn’t so much involved in this, because I was not the project leader.
1:21:39
Jack was fighting those battles.
1:21:42
He would have to go to Blue River and be present for their
1:21:45
10-year planning sessions.
1:21:45
I think 5-year, 10-year plans; any
1:21:51
good organization would have these plans.
1:21:54
He would have to sit down there, and they would say, “Jack, don’t you realize, we’ve
1:22:01
got to get “X”-million board feet off this district every year, and we can’t find
1:22:10
that many logs, if the Andrews doesn’t do their fair share.” [Tapping on papers]
1:22:17
In this write-up [document provided interviewees by Geier] , you are
1:22:18
entirely correct in saying we had the attitude, right from year “one,
1:22:24
that I was involved down there.
1:22:28
You know, ’63 and ’62, that if it wasn’t for a research purpose,
1:22:34
a purely research purpose, we weren’t going to allow any logging.
1:22:39
Jack would have to fight these battles and come back really
1:22:43
worn out, saying, “Jiminy.
1:22:45
I don’t know
1:22:53
if we can hold ‘em off.” Undoubtedly, Jerry is going to be more up on
1:22:56
this, but that was the interaction.
1:22:57
It was interaction for space.
1:23:00
To begin with, do you know where our lab was?
1:23:03
It was in a trailer!
1:23:06
We got a lab trailer kind of custom built, because we had a certain
1:23:13
amount of things that we had to do with the water samples, like
1:23:17
preliminary analysis
1:23:21
we needed lab space for.
1:23:25
Subsequent to that, I don’t know what year, but early on, they added on to the
1:23:30
ranger station down there, built more in back--a daylight basement-type thing,
1:23:37
and the ranger station is on that slope.
1:23:41
When they designed that addition, we got our “oar in” and said, “We’d like a little
1:23:48
lab down there, as well as office space.” And that is what eventually occurred.
1:23:58
That’s at the Blue River Ranger Station?
1:24:00
Yeah.
1:24:00
The district ranger station.
1:24:08
When was that?
1:24:08
I can’t remember.
1:24:08
Around ‘64 or something like that.
1:24:11
It was fairly early on because we didn’t have to use that lab.
1:24:14
I don’t know what happened to that lab trailer, eventually.
1:24:17
Al
1:24:23
would probably know, or some of the other guys.
1:24:26
You were wise to have the interaction, because we didn’t have any interaction!
1:24:31
Those guys would
1:24:34
show mild courtesy and interest in what we were doing.
1:24:40
But I remember, this was in ’68 or ’69, something like that, maybe ’70.
1:24:50
One of our roadside plots was on that road going up to the Watershed 1 landing.
1:24:55
Now it’s all reforested.
1:24:59
But we had roadside plots up there below the road to Watershed 1 landing.
1:25:06
We were working out there one time and the district ranger showed up.
1:25:13
Boy, the district ranger!
1:25:17
He was just up there driving around doing
1:25:23
an inspection.
1:25:25
He was by himself.
1:25:26
I can’t even remember
1:25:30
now who it was.
1:25:31
But, he wasn’t that interested.
1:25:33
I remember feeling very disappointed!
1:25:37
You know, this is a good “show-me” thing, these different treatments. We had the
1:25:43
Blue River mix that they were using, and we had found some that were better than
1:25:51
that. But he wasn’t much interested.
1:25:55
He wasn’t “involved” in it then?
1:25:57
Yeah, they thought, “These guys are in their ivory tower. We got
1:26:07
[to get the cut
1:26:10
out] .” They were just out there to “get the cut out.”
1:26:12
They had their hands full, just
1:26:16
to do that.
1:26:17
We did get cooperation, such as burning the slash on Watershed 1.
1:26:23
When
1:26:31
I go to the LTER meetings -- like last Friday -- and I look around, there are
1:26:38
at least three people from the district.
1:26:40
There’s the district ranger
1:26:44
-- I forget her name [Lynn Burditt] -- and John Cissel, and the other
1:26:48
guy— [the] silviculturist – and there they are at our meeting.
1:26:53
Well, that would have been so far out in left field that it was just
1:27:00
mind-boggling, about the progress made.
1:27:04
It had to be a special kind of a guy, and [Steve] Eubanks was the first one.
1:27:11
I was up in Alaska during this time, but that was one shock to my system
1:27:19
when I came down from Alaska, and started to sit in on these meetings.
1:27:24
[LTER meetings]
1:27:24
When did you come back from up there?
1:27:25
That was what year?
1:27:25
In Fall of ‘90.
1:27:25
Fall of 1990.
1:27:26
Yeah.
1:27:30
But, early on, I didn’t get really involved, not until later,
1:27:35
in ‘91, 92, because I had heart surgery, stuff like that first.
1:27:41
But, after that [I did more] . So, that was a shock.
1:27:46
Another shock was to go to the administrative site
1:27:52
[HJA EF] , which was when I left for Alaska [in 1970s] , only
1:27:56
a shed for a snowmobile,
1:28:00
that, and the climate station.
1:28:03
That was all that was there.
1:28:09
None of this!
1:28:09
[Modern campus of today – mostly built]
1:28:12
Yeah.
1:28:13
That’s quite a phenomenal place up there right now.
1:28:13
Yeah, I could imagine people stumbling on this place, the general public,
1:28:17
saying, “What is going on?” You’d have
1:28:21
to stumble on it.
1:28:22
If you don’t know where it is located, you’d probably never find it.
1:28:25
I heard so much talking about the trailers.
1:28:26
When I went up there, I was actually kind of shocked, how extensively developed
1:28:30
it was, with all the research going on.
1:28:32
Yeah.
1:28:34
But you left to go to Alaska about the time that change took place
1:28:41
[IBP program and start of facilities planning] , but as long as you were there,
1:28:50
up until, was it ’74?
1:28:50
I left spring of ‘74.
1:28:50
Up until that time, the involvement with the district and national forest [Blue
1:28:54
River RD and Willamette NF] was minimal?
1:28:56
We had, oh, what’s his name?
1:28:57
[Willamette National Forest Supervisor Mike] Kerrick?
1:28:57
Yeah!
1:28:58
Kerrick.
1:29:05
He was one of the good
1:29:08
ones.
1:29:09
We had good ones that would be more helpful.
1:29:16
Even when the district ranger lived right next to our person.
1:29:20
Their houses are right next door to each other.
1:29:23
So,
1:29:28
it wasn’t that it was un-neighborly.
1:29:31
Mostly it was that we were
1:29:34
ignored.
1:29:36
Did
1:29:39
you put any plots in on National Forest land that was logged, in
1:29:43
other words, off-the-Andrews sites?
1:29:46
In that period, did you work at all
1:29:52
with the district to do that?
1:29:53
Did anybody ask you to do that?
1:29:53
No.
1:29:54
I must have worked with the district when I put in this vegetation
1:29:59
plot I was telling you about, when we were trying out different
1:30:01
species with the SCS cooperation.
1:30:05
Then, we’d work with them a little
1:30:12
on the shoreline of Blue River Reservoir when that was first built and filled.
1:30:21
The problem being,
1:30:25
on a
1:30:27
reservoir like that where the water is drawn up and down, there’s a lot of
1:30:33
siltation and bank-cutting that goes on.
1:30:37
It would be really nice to have vegetation you could plant that could withstand
1:30:44
periodic inundation and yet remain viable.
1:30:49
That was the “Holy Grail”
1:30:53
that we were looking for with the SCS cooperation.
1:30:58
To this day I don’t think we’ve found it. I don’t know if anyone is
1:31:00
even [laughs] working on that idea anymore, but we worried about it.
1:31:09
My
1:31:14
involvement would be to charge down from Corvallis and leave the contact
1:31:23
with the district, more to the people that were living down there, like Al or
1:31:31
Ross or
1:31:37
Dick.
1:31:37
I’d never get much involved with it.
1:31:42
Although, once we did start the IBP, I
1:31:48
think that that’s when the breakthrough was made.
1:31:51
We
1:31:54
increased the level of involvement many-fold!
1:31:58
We would
1:32:03
have
1:32:06
meetings down there in their conference room, and invite their participation.
1:32:18
Well that sounds like a productive decade.
1:32:19
Yeah, Jerry’s right.
1:32:23
If we hadn’t gotten “on-board” with the IBP, I shudder.
1:32:28
I think that he deserves all the credit in the world!
1:32:33
To realize that,
1:32:36
“Yes, we gotta get out of our comfort zone and get on-board.” And that
1:32:43
very year we made this decision and started our involvement, the
1:32:50
Forest Service put on a national training session at Madison,
1:32:55
Wisconsin, on “systems ecology.”
1:33:03
Jerry said, “We’ve gotta go to that and find out what this is all about!” [Laughs]
1:33:07
Yeah, we were completely naïve, but
1:33:16
I went to the whole thing.
1:33:19
Jerry just came for the second week, and was astounded.
1:33:24
It was kind of boring, with just lectures, and he said, “You guys
1:33:34
have been putting up with this stuff?” [Laughs] “You’ve been putting up with
1:33:35
this for a whole week and not had a mutiny or anything?” But the Forest Service got
1:33:44
employees and people from universities, and a lot of it was centered
1:33:50
on computer-modeling systems.
1:33:56
We were naïve back then, I’ll tell you.
1:33:56
But early on,
1:34:02
we were going to grow an entire ecosystem,
1:34:10
and that was
1:34:13
what we were always striving for.
1:34:17
We’d go, “You know,
1:34:20
we don’t know much at all about these
1:34:24
systems.
1:34:28
How limiting is soil moisture to our communities in
1:34:36
the Andrews?
1:34:36
Or, how are nutrients cycled through this system?
1:34:42
Or how long do leaves stay on the trees?
1:34:46
We don’t even know that.” These kind of
1:34:53
things.
1:34:53
When I look back at it, that’s what modeling accomplishes.
1:34:59
You don’t get all these sophisticated models up and running with a
1:35:04
lot of predictive capacity.
1:35:06
What you do is you find out your stupidity.
1:35:11
That’s
1:35:13
when we started saying, “We’ve gotta get these long-term
1:35:21
Forest Service
1:35:24
plots that they’d established just to track tree growth, when’s the volume
1:35:33
put on, and how fast is it put on, and spacing.” What we were thinking
1:35:40
was [an ecological approach] what we called, early on, “reference stands,”
1:35:45
based on the classification Jerry and I had made of the forest communities.
1:35:53
We said, let’s get really good representatives of the different
1:35:57
communities, representing the whole spectrum of productivities,
1:36:04
moisture variability, etc., and
1:36:12
then measure these
1:36:16
on a
1:36:22
long-term basis.
1:36:23
That started the Long Term Ecological Reserve [LTER] concept.
1:36:25
In the work that you were doing at that point, did you get a sense in
1:36:31
1968 that this was going to take off?
1:36:34
You left for Alaska about that time, and as I recall, [PNW Station Director]
1:36:35
Bob Buckman had to push you to go
1:36:37
to Alaska?
1:36:38
I wondered what had happened.
1:36:41
[Laughs] Go to Alaska.
1:36:43
Did you get a sense that you were leaving something behind that was
1:36:45
just getting ready to take off?
1:36:48
Yes.
1:36:49
I did.
1:36:50
But, I left with a
1:36:56
little missionary zeal
1:36:59
that we could do similar things there, too.
1:37:03
Which, I didn’t have to, because a lot of guys up there were already converted,
1:37:08
like Keith [Van Cleve] . Keith was coming down and sitting in on a lot
1:37:13
of our coniferous biome meetings.
1:37:18
He was on board.
1:37:21
As I told you before, the coniferous biome threw a bone or two Alaska’s way
1:37:30
– little studies they could do up there.
1:37:32
But in the main, we were getting shut out, so that’s
1:37:44
when we decided to do our own program.
1:37:44
You’d invested at least 12 years of more than 14 years of your professional life in
1:37:50
the Forest Service, in the Andrews program
1:37:54
and research plots you put in in the early ‘60s.
1:37:58
Did you maintain active contact with people you’d worked with down
1:38:02
here, while you were in Alaska?
1:38:04
Well, it was very hard.
1:38:05
Very hard.
1:38:09
Jerry and I talked a lot, back-and-forth.
1:38:14
He kept me apprised of what was happening on the plots that Charlie
1:38:20
Halpern, his grad student, was going to take on, and I said, “Great.”
1:38:27
That’s hard to leave your babies behind.
1:38:36
When
1:38:40
Charlie did the analyses, he
1:38:45
used my plots and used my experimental design, and you
1:38:50
want to get at least a junior
1:38:56
authorship on it.
1:38:57
Probably shouldn’t take too much longer here, but I wanted to get back to this,
1:39:00
because you raised it last year when I was talking to you [for Alaska Forest
1:39:02
Service history/science project] , and you raised it this year, or earlier today.
1:39:07
You mentioned last time, that in making the move to Alaska, you were afraid of
1:39:11
becoming a bit too provincial here, and in discussing why you decided to take
1:39:16
the position here, instead of the one in Minnesota, you were concerned about
1:39:19
this, perhaps, being provincial, also.
1:39:23
That is an interesting theme you’re working with there.
1:39:28
What is your sense of this group here being, kind of outside the
1:39:32
mainstream of what was going on?
1:39:34
And I’m not sure if that’s really what’s going on, but why don’t you
1:39:36
explain what you’re talking about there?
1:39:39
I’m not sure what?
1:39:41
Is there something about living in Oregon that -- [interrupted by loud laughter]
1:39:46
? Yeah, you know.
1:39:47
I’ve wondered that myself.
1:39:48
Yeah.
1:39:51
Oregon
1:39:56
in the ‘50s,
1:40:05
I
1:40:08
think
1:40:10
it was provincial and conservative.
1:40:11
I think it was more a feeling of
1:40:17
rising to a new challenge, a new adventure, and as I told you before, I
1:40:22
had always been interested in Alaska.
1:40:26
What kid isn’t, really?
1:40:34
I remember distinctly, because during the time I was making my decision
1:40:41
whether to go to Alaska or not, Jerry of course, was in Washington, D.C.
1:40:46
NSF?
1:40:49
NSF.
1:40:49
He was their program leader for ecosystem analysis.
1:40:55
And incidentally, that’s when he was worried about getting enough
1:40:59
proposals to make the program viable.
1:41:02
Proposals were just not coming in.
1:41:04
And so, he was thumping the country.
1:41:06
Had he just gone there then?
1:41:08
Yeah.
1:41:09
He’d been there for a few months.
1:41:10
I’d been back there to visit him.
1:41:14
I remember calling him up, and I said, “Jerry, they want me to go to Fairbanks.”
1:41:21
I knew what he was going to say.
1:41:21
He
1:41:23
knew already, as Jerry always has his ear to the ground.
1:41:30
I remember he said,
1:41:34
“Well, sometimes, you just have to go and rise to the challenge.”
1:41:40
And I said, “Well, Jerry, if I went there,
1:41:44
I wouldn’t view it as a real long-term thing,
1:41:51
because, I’d like to come back.”
1:42:00
And he really encouraged me to take it.
1:42:03
What happened really, I didn’t have that option.
1:42:09
That’s when things started to get tight [fiscal in USFS] , and so, Jerry, I think
1:42:15
remembers that I didn’t want to come back.
1:42:19
I don’t think that’s the way it was.
1:42:21
Although, I’ve got to admit, that once you get there, and start having fun.....
1:42:28
He came back here about ’76, didn’t he?
1:42:29
Yeah.
1:42:33
When he came back, he said, “Well, I’m going to try to make room for you
1:42:37
in this project here.” And I said, “Great.” But the station didn’t work
1:42:45
it out, as far as positions, and we getting pretty involved up there.
1:42:56
But,
1:43:00
it wasn’t so much
1:43:03
opportunity for professional development that I went there for, so
1:43:09
much as I just wanted to see Alaska.
1:43:13
Yeah, you mentioned you’d wanted to go there ever since you were a little boy.
1:43:14
Yeah, yeah,
1:43:16
yeah.
1:43:17
Once again, I’m not too much of a scientist, really.
1:43:22
I’m too impetuous.
1:43:25
[Laughs]
1:43:27
I’m not so sure that isn’t what makes a good scientist, but – [Laughs].
1:43:30
Well, Jerry’s that way too.
1:43:34
What we always say about Jerry, “He’s an idea man.”
1:43:40
Boy, spark these ideas, but somebody needs to come and pick up
1:43:45
after him. He’s not a detail man.
1:43:48
You generally envision scientists paying attention to details in a
1:43:53
laboratory, and Jerry’s never done that.
1:43:57
I think on any kind of a test like Myers-Briggs, he’d come out like me,
1:44:05
that kind of a person – almost artistic.
1:44:12
I remember when I first took an aptitude test, I might have told
1:44:25
you this before, I used to score on “outdoors” high, which you could imagine,
1:44:33
and artistic. The only job I could think of was “landscape architect.”
1:44:42
[Laughs]
1:44:42
Well, in a sense, that’s what you got involved in, I guess.
1:44:45
My daughter took one of these tests last summer when she was
1:44:50
home working as an intern on the [Albany, Oregon] Democrat Herald.
1:44:54
She will be finishing up her master’s in journalism at [U.C.] Berkeley this year.
1:45:02
She took one of these tests, and when you finish the test, in the back of the book
1:45:08
it tells you what career you’re heading for, and the heading was journalist.
1:45:16
Geez, she’s the
1:45:20
kind of person that needs to be at the center of things, to know what’s going on.
1:45:25
She enters the room and says, “What’s going on?” You know, that type of thing.
1:45:31
I thought that was pretty scary.
1:45:33
[Laughs]
1:45:34
That’s an interesting theme you raised – these attributes of an artist.
1:45:40
Do you get a sense that the attributes of a scientist changed between 1950
1:45:47
and the 1980s?
1:45:47
Also, what people are attracted into the field?
1:45:52
Also, the group dynamic that you’ve got going here.
1:45:55
Yeah.
1:45:55
If you can get away from the lone-scientist theme, what happened
1:45:59
at the Andrews sounds like room was made for people with that kind of
1:46:02
leaning [artistic/collaborative]
1:46:02
. But see, if you sat around and said, “We need people to work on soil
1:46:07
hydrology. We need more input on
1:46:15
tree growth, stem-sectioning, that sort of thing, and we need more
1:46:20
information on nutrient cycling and soil chemistry.” We all listed these, so
1:46:28
we were all primed for the IBP to come to pass, and suddenly, we had money.
1:46:35
We had people.
1:46:38
Once you got that, access to that kind of funding, did you
1:46:41
consciously go out and try to attract people into the group there?
1:46:43
No, the way it works is
1:46:48
that once a nucleus is established, and they know that there’s at
1:46:56
least a small amount of funding,
1:47:01
people are attracted in.
1:47:06
I remember a time that Jerry and I presented a seminar one evening
1:47:11
at the University of Oregon
1:47:16
with mostly geologists.
1:47:21
Alan Kayes
1:47:24
was there.
1:47:25
Fred [Swanson] was there.
1:47:25
And that’s the first time Fred had ever heard of what we were
1:47:30
doing.
1:47:31
Fred, from the start was very enthused, “Oh, gee, this is neat!
1:47:36
You get to work in biology and silviculture, geography, whatever!”
1:47:48
People are either cut out for that or they’re not. We had another guy,
1:47:59
he just retired, and he was on Jerry’s project.
1:48:05
He was kind of an ecologist interested in the way plants
1:48:08
respond to their environment.
1:48:12
Jerry never could get him to cooperate with us.
1:48:16
He just
1:48:22
wasn’t cut out for it.
1:48:22
Some people, it sparks them, and some people just really
1:48:29
just prefer to work alone.
1:48:32
It’s not that they’re introverts or extroverts,
1:48:37
or anything like that.
1:48:39
Who was that?
1:48:39
Minore was his name.
1:48:39
Don Minore.
1:48:40
Good guy.
1:48:42
But Don never did much work on the Andrews.
1:48:47
He worked southwestern Oregon,
1:48:51
and he worked on huckleberries.
1:48:55
Good ecologist.
1:48:57
I have all the respect in the world for him.
1:48:59
And a nice guy.
1:49:01
But, you know, as Jerry said, “Well, there’s some people
1:49:05
that aren’t cut out for it.”
1:49:08
It sounds like there’s this core group of people that get together, and that sort of
1:49:12
leads to a self-selecting group of people who pick up their work, and you invite
1:49:18
them to get involved with this group?
1:49:19
[Andrews and ecosystem science/interdisciplinary work.]
1:49:19
. Yeah, that’s what we did in Alaska, too.
1:49:23
There’s been all kinds of criticism against Keith, maybe Les, and maybe
1:49:30
me, saying that we “cut-out” people
1:49:35
[excluded] . No! We didn’t!
1:49:35
We said, “We always let you know. If you want to cooperate in LTER, come to
1:49:42
our planning meetings. We’re going to start work on our proposal next week.
1:49:50
If you’re interested, come.
1:49:52
You’re more
1:49:54
than welcome.
1:49:55
We expect you to have ideas of how you can cooperate and contribute.”
1:50:05
It’s tough, maybe my head’s in
1:50:13
the clouds, and maybe some people were intimidated or
1:50:16
think they would not be welcome.
1:50:21
But, for example, we had people come forward that wanted to study mosses.
1:50:28
Great.
1:50:35
We don’t know anything about mosses.
1:50:38
Study mosses.
1:50:39
I can think of other examples where we went out and recruited.
1:50:46
We needed somebody to do soils work on the reference stands.
1:50:52
We went to Chet [Youngberg - OSU] and said, “Who do you got?”
1:50:58
Randy [Brown] did it, and did a good job.
1:51:06
Except for the fact, doggone it, he never even acknowledged there was a
1:51:11
soil survey already done on the Andrews.
1:51:16
I think, because the soils were never officially coordinated into the National
1:51:21
Cooperative Soil Survey Program.
1:51:24
That was a puzzlement to me.
1:51:27
He
1:51:29
wrote a thesis, a master’s thesis on the soils, and that’s a case where
1:51:34
we went out and recruited a guy, and he fit in well with the crew.
1:51:39
There are long-term cooperators in this, and there’s guys that weave in-and-out.
1:51:50
Yeah, that’s one thing I was interested in for this study.
1:51:51
I think
1:51:54
this group is good because it really always held to a schedule, “We’re
1:52:00
gonna get together once a month!”
1:52:04
Come hell or high water, we’re gonna get together. And that’s good.
1:52:09
Not everybody attends, but the core group’s there, and
1:52:14
people ask what’s going on.
1:52:15
There’s
1:52:18
certain structure we have, but boy, over the years, the structure has been minimal.
1:52:24
You know
1:52:32
Fred’s the leader here, but outside of one or two guys, he doesn’t supervise them.
1:52:41
He has to do it by just getting cooperation.
1:52:45
Voluntary.
1:52:46
He’s not got any official pie to head over them.
1:52:51
Sometimes, it’s too bad he doesn’t.
1:52:53
I’m not sure how much time we’ve got here, but we should probably get
1:52:57
out of Steve’s [Acker, who shares Dryness’ office] hair in a little bit.
1:52:58
Yeah, we’ve got to go.
1:53:00
No problem.
1:53:00
[Laughs]
1:53:02
I just want to ask you a couple of things here.
1:53:04
You mentioned last year about how a group of you were working down
1:53:08
there on the Andrews, and just started talking to each other.
1:53:13
Who else besides you?
1:53:15
You mentioned several other people already, but was there a kind of a
1:53:18
jelling point that you can recall, where you all kind of came together?
1:53:20
I’ve got records of Jerry trying to organize, in the mid-70s, a group of
1:53:21
researchers, and they all got together
1:53:25
at the Hoh River, someplace like that.
1:53:26
[Franklin organized 1-2 week group research events called “scientific
1:53:26
pulses,” including those on the Hoh River in Olympic NP, in late 1970s,
1:53:26
an idea exercised elsewhere in Oregon
1:53:34
and Washington.]
1:53:34
Yeah.
1:53:35
I was just wondering if there was some kind of a jelling point on
1:53:37
the Andrews, where people who were actually there on site, sat down
1:53:37
and started talking a little more?
1:53:37
I think that would
1:53:44
have been,
1:53:47
up until IBP, you can almost count the number of people that
1:53:51
worked there on a regular basis, on your fingers of one hand.
1:53:56
We’d bring in people, like Jerry brought in Will Moir, a graduate student/friend
1:54:05
to help us.
1:54:08
But it was pretty much
1:54:13
Dick Fredriksen, Al Levno, Ross Mersereau,
1:54:21
Jack Rothacher,
1:54:24
Jerry [Franklin] , and I
1:54:29
[Ted Dyrness] . On a regular basis, that was about it.
1:54:32
And you were all pretty much aware of each other’s work on an ongoing basis?
1:54:39
Yeah.
1:54:40
What it boiled down to was Jack’s project [watersheds] and
1:54:43
Jerry’s [Various, regeneration, vegetation, forest ecology.] Really.
1:54:46
Hmm.
1:54:49
And Jerry, as I say, would bring in some of his friends.
1:54:54
We got
1:54:57
Francis Herman to do stem sectioning
1:55:04
work in the area.
1:55:07
I remember him being down there.
1:55:11
See, we’re pretty limited in that expertise.
1:55:20
Our expertise was hydrology, soils,
1:55:26
but as far as other areas, we needed guys like Fred.
1:55:34
See, Fred’s interests more or less coincided with the beginning of IBP.
1:55:40
It wasn’t until we got the
1:55:44
IBP, that we really had
1:55:49
that much of a
1:55:52
real interdisciplinary team.
1:55:54
That was when Dennis Harr started working there [hydrology, precipitation dynamics,
1:55:59
rain/snow, etc.] , and George Carroll from University of Oregon, for tree lichens, as
1:56:09
we started climbing trees, and
1:56:14
expert help in
1:56:21
biometrics with guys like Scott Overton.
1:56:27
You could look at some of those early IBP proposals, and they’ll give you
1:56:33
a flavor, but that’s when we started.
1:56:39
And of course, anything like that kind of starts and builds.
1:56:43
I don’t recall, maybe Jerry can recall a real turning point
1:56:49
to it.
1:56:50
Also, intermixed with
1:56:54
early stages of IBP, was this feud with the University of Washington.
1:56:58
Hmm.
1:57:00
They wanted to capture the major share of the funding for Cedar River,
1:57:05
Finley Lake, their sites up there [Washington state] , and we wanted
1:57:09
the major share to be for the Andrews.
1:57:14
That would be the intensive study type.
1:57:16
The concept of IBP was that you had an intensive study site and
1:57:20
then you have satellite sites.
1:57:24
Those satellite sites would maybe be in Alaska or someplace like Cedar
1:57:29
River.
1:57:30
But
1:57:32
there was a big kind of power struggle.
