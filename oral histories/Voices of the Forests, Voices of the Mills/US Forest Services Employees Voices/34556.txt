00:01
I was just curious, did you ever schedule pulses out on the Andrews itself?
00:10
Yes and no.
00:12
We never called them pulses, but we scheduled intense periods of activity.
00:17
We did things like Andrews Day [HJA Days; public, researchers, educators,
00:21
etc.] . And we got everybody together.
00:23
So, what I would call those today is mini-pulses.
00:28
Okay.
00:28
We did a number of those on the Andrews.
00:30
And, we would take field trips as a group.
00:36
I remember in '85-'86 when I was working a lot on synthesis, and
00:47
I remember taking two or three days and a group of us going to Cascade Head to
00:52
work on a review of coarse woody debris.
00:58
We learned early on, the value
01:06
of getting away as a group for two or three days.
01:10
Going someplace and just getting out, flashing around, grooving on stuff,
01:14
because we learned sometime by the mid '70s, that we really got insights when
01:21
we were just out with each other talking.
01:27
And I really learned that, it was about that time when I went, “Holy shit,
01:33
you’re really having the basis in terms of integration when you're out here
01:41
sitting on a log with these people, or out there sitting on a boulder
01:44
in the middle of a creek. And you just need time to go out and share
01:50
perspectives.” And so, I think the group has tried to do that periodically.
01:59
Those are things that just sort of gradually evolved.
02:04
Initially, it was just something that people were getting together
02:06
out there because they were there working together on a project?
02:10
Yeah.
02:16
I can remember in, by 1980 people saying, "We haven’t been out in
02:21
the woods together for a while.
02:23
We need to all get in a van and go someplace.
02:28
Spend a couple of days.” And we’d do
02:33
it.
02:33
Was this different there than in other places you've worked?
02:36
Oh, I've never found another place like it.
02:42
I think that maybe a few other places are like it.
02:44
I think that maybe Coweeta, in some ways, is like it.
02:46
But,
02:49
it's a voluntary association of very bright people who fundamentally feel
02:55
they learn more by working with each other than by working by themselves.
02:59
And,
03:07
it’s extraordinary.
03:10
I've never seen anything like it, anywhere else, except perhaps, Coweeta.
03:18
Must be a little satisfaction knowing you had a part in putting that together there.
03:21
Oh, that was extremely satisfying!
03:23
And, I don't have any doubt at all that
03:33
my creations are totally a product of my interactions with other people.
03:41
Most of my contributions effectively are integrations
03:46
with other people’s information.
03:50
In
03:53
administering the program and in synthesizing the program, I learned
03:59
that what was most important was for me is to listen to other people.
04:05
I said I was a benevolent dictator, and what I did was to listen to the people,
04:11
and see what they were interested in, and try to craft a program to capture
04:17
as much of that as possible, but still, it was sufficiently integrated that the
04:23
foundation [NSF] was going buy off on it.
04:27
That was kind of what I was constantly doing, and that was one of the differences
04:32
between Dick Waring and I. Dick always had an idea that he thought was important.
04:39
He likes really simple, crisp, hypothetical constructs.
04:45
But, if you go that way, you leave most of the people out.
04:50
So, I learned what I was doing, intuitively, was listening to the
04:55
people and sort of optimizing a career program that captured the best of
05:00
the ideas and the best of the people,
05:04
but still you couldn't have odd pieces.
05:10
You had to be able to bring those into some kind of an integrated or linked form.
05:17
It
05:19
was the same way at the other end of the process, of the learning process.
05:24
You know, listening.
05:26
And, Wow!!!
05:28
Right on!!
05:29
I hadn't thought about that.
05:30
That fits!
05:34
I give my father a tremendous amount of credit for that.
05:39
Why?
05:39
Yeah, he modeled that behavior.
05:44
I didn't realize it until the mid '80s, about which time he died.
05:53
But, that's exactly what he did.
05:58
You mean in family situations?
06:00
No, with other men.
06:01
Oh really?
06:03
He was a leader.
06:04
He
06:09
would have been a top sergeant, that’s the kind of a person who was.
06:14
He was a person that other men admired.
06:20
He listened to
06:23
them.
06:24
And they responded to him.
06:28
I probably didn’t explain that well.
06:31
No.
06:32
But,
06:34
people lead in different ways.
06:36
Sure.
06:36
Yeah.
06:38
In effect, what he modeled was leading by listening.
06:43
By sensing where a group of people needed to go, and integrating as much
06:48
of their interests and motivation as possibrle in that process.
06:55
They knew that he was genuinely interested and committed to them.
07:01
That's what the people at the Andrews knew about me.
07:05
I think, that's why the science came, because they knew what I did.
07:09
It was, “Ultimately,
07:13
he's a dictator, but he's our dictator, and he's got our best interest at
07:17
heart, and he's done a pretty good job.”
07:21
I’m curious about your father.
07:23
Was he involved in union activities or what was he leading?
07:26
Yeah, he became a union leader, and ultimately, became a
07:31
foreman, which is not surprising.
07:35
Yeah.
07:36
But.
07:37
Yeah.
07:38
That's fine.
07:38
So growing up around the mill, right?
07:41
Yeah.
07:41
He became shop steward,
07:47
a labor leader.
07:50
Ultimately management wanted him in a foreman position.
07:55
That’s kind of equivalent to a top sergeant.
07:57
Although, it could also be seen as equivalent to lieutenant, I
08:04
think, in terms of hierarchy.
08:04
That’s an interesting irony there, where your ideas of cooperative research which
08:09
became so important in the old-growth controversy has its roots actually
08:13
in the timber mill, your father’s.
08:16
The model came from my father.
08:19
He was a laborer in the mill.
08:22
That’s interesting.
08:23
This is my last question by the way.
08:27
I wanted to run by you to get your reaction to my perception, at least, is
08:33
the Andrews really leaped into public awareness with the controversy of the
08:37
1980s, and what about the Andrews group put it in a position where it became
08:45
that significant in what was going on?
08:47
Well, the most obvious thing is that it was generally the only group of
08:52
people that did any significant [laughing] research on old
08:54
growth, so, it's pretty obvious.
08:56
But in addition to that, the nature of the research program at the Andrews,
09:01
the ecosystem research program, its power, and we see it at Coweeta,
09:05
we see it at Hubbard Brook, is its ability to turn in any direction.
09:11
That is to say, you may construct a program that addresses perceived
09:19
problems with timber management, or with global warming, or with
09:26
pollutants, or with whatever.
09:30
But a program like the one at the Andrews, looks basically at the processes, the
09:37
structures and the organism,s in an integrated fashion, which turns out
09:42
to be extremely powerful in that it can be used to address a tremendous
09:48
variety of questions, including questions that are totally unasked.
09:53
And so,
09:56
we started some of
10:00
the Andrews work looking at nutrient cycling,
10:04
looking at impacts on productivity.
10:07
But it turns out, that same information is very useful when you begin to
10:11
assess and model global warming.
10:15
So, the power of the ecosystem program is
10:21
generality in the relationships that they give you insight that turns out to be
10:27
relevant to a whole train of questions.
10:29
Some recognized, some
10:35
are not.
10:35
We had a program we'd been working on natural forests, old-growth
10:39
forests, and associated streams.
10:42
But, you also had a program by its structure, that was set to answer a
10:50
variety of questions about old growth.
10:54
Want to know about productivity?
10:55
Want to know about effect on water quality?
10:57
Want to know how it's going to respond to a disturbance?
11:00
Any of
11:03
it.
11:03
And you see it at the Coweeta program.
11:05
Same way.
11:06
You see it at Hubbard Brook.
11:07
Same way.
11:08
Somehow, that kind of science is just so problem relevant that it can be
11:15
used in a tremendous variety of ways.
11:17
That's why I say, it can turn to face almost any direction.
11:22
The challenge comes from one side, turns around, and comes from another end.
11:27
How do you preserve old-growth forests?
11:31
And address that.
11:31
So, the adaptability of the group is built into the structure
11:37
of the group, in other words?
11:38
Built into the kind of science they do.
11:45
I guess I should probably let you go here.
11:47
You’ve got one more, do you?
11:48
[Laughing]
11:49
No, I think I'll probably have to get back in touch with you again.
11:54
Well, I anticipated you would.
11:55
You said you wanted a couple of sessions anyway.
11:59
I like to talk about this stuff.
12:00
Oh, this is really fascinating.
12:02
I've got good material here.
12:04
I'm working on putting the proposal together right now and getting into
12:06
the framework of the study together, and starting next spring I'm doing
12:11
a second series of interviews where people can see more
12:13
narrowly on particular issues.
12:15
This is a good kind of general overview of your involvement.
12:19
I'll get back in touch with you probably in December or so.
12:23
Fred may have recorded the seven lives or the nine lives of Jerry Franklin.
12:29
It was a seminar I gave on my retirement, and, at his suggestion, I went through
12:37
the episodes of my professional life.
12:40
He mentioned that.
12:41
I'll have to ask him about that.
12:41
I think he's got it on tape.
12:46
The seven lives of
12:46
-- ? -- The seven lives or the nine lives of Jerry Franklin; the “research
12:51
natural area” life, and the biome life, and the old-growth life……..
12:59
Yeah.
13:01
The question I was kind of getting ready to ask, but held off on was,
13:05
I was just curious if you have any regrets for not being involved?
13:08
You still work with the group obviously, but you're not as directly
13:12
involved now as you had been?
13:13
I miss them.
13:14
But,
13:20
life's a linear process, and you move on.
13:23
I've maintained my contacts with them, and hopefully I'll get a chance
13:27
to do more work with them again, but
13:31
[sigh], I miss them, but I think I don't regret the decision that I made.
13:42
This is the end of the interview with Jerry Franklin.
13:44
The interview was actually held in his cabin on the Gifford Pinchot
13:49
National Forest near Wind River.
