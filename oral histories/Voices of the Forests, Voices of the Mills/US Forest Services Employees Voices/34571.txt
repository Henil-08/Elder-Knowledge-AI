00:03
The leadership transition occurred when Jerry would be off somewhere,
00:09
and then Fred would take over.
00:11
Or the group would have to choose who to send to a coordinating committee meeting,
00:16
and there would be a short list of people who everyone wanted to make sure attended.
00:25
In this line of work there are people who want very much to be involved when there
00:31
are a lot of people who are interested in the process and interested in the outcome,
00:36
but are not themselves willing to advance themselves forward into leadership roles,
00:41
except where certain things come up.
00:46
So I think the transfer was, really very smooth, because
00:52
the group had experience with, people like Fred operating in that role prior, and
01:02
the transition stage with Jerry was not an abrupt one.
01:05
It was a gradual one.
01:06
So, the gradual nature of the transition was what allowed it to happen without
01:16
any kind of formal thing, and at some point, I think someone said,
01:18
“All right, I’ll be PI,” and I think Fred was ready to serve in that role.
01:26
Fred has a very nice way of phrasing those things in ways that make it easy for you,
01:31
to go along with, “Unless there are strong objections to that, I’ll just continue
01:35
in that role.” They just nod their heads.
01:40
That’s kind of how it happened, and again, it fit within the general strength
01:46
of the group of not bringing these things into a sort of contentious place
01:55
and finding the course of least resistance and following that.
02:01
As you say, if that’s essential for success in an LTER program, is there
02:05
any conscious effort on the part of the group now to identify people that
02:09
are likely possible candidates for?
02:12
I think probably more so than I am fully aware of.
02:17
The thing is that everybody, we’re all grown-ups now, and we all look
02:21
around the room, to see who is playing a role in which they’re
02:26
likely, in which that role is likely.
02:29
And again, people who step forward and say, “I am sufficiently attached
02:36
to this enterprise and I’m going to make it a main piece of my focal
02:42
point.” There is a very short list of people who do that.
02:44
So yes, those people are identified and are identifying themselves, and for the
02:50
most part I think the group accepts that.
02:55
To not accept that would be, either means that you yourself would have to
02:59
step forward, or else you would have to challenge somebody else, neither one
03:04
of which are most people’s inclination, particularly “if it ain’t broke.” I
03:15
suspect that Fred thinks about that,
03:24
and I’m sure it weighs on him, that “If I get hit by a truck,
03:30
what’s going to happen?” And it’s like, if you have a feeling for the
03:35
enterprise as being greater than any one person or the sum of its parts,
03:40
you have to look to how we do that.
03:44
I don’t know, but that’s where I think things stand now.
03:51
I don’t think there is a clear, designated, heir apparent.
03:56
I think there are people who are operating in a way that would let them
04:01
step into that role if they needed to.
04:05
I think the group, I think any transition,
04:11
in part because the nature of the enterprise
04:15
has become more diffused over a wider group of people, wider set of disciplines,
04:21
less geographical identity to the Andrews itself, or participants because
04:28
they want to participate, that the next transition might be a little more bumpy.
04:35
Even with somebody sort of working in the same way as the past, just because
04:41
there might be some discussion about how we want to do it.
04:46
Do we want to do it the same way we’ve done it?
04:47
I could maybe project that a little bit.
04:51
As you suggested, it’s not been a contentious process, and as you
04:54
noted, if there is a conflict, the group doesn’t have a lot of
04:58
experience dealing with that.
05:00
I guess Jerry Franklin and Dick Waring would be one example of how a conflict was
05:03
resolved without disturbing the structure.
05:05
Right.
05:05
That predated me, and
05:10
to this day I don’t fully understand that, and part of my personal thing is,
05:21
my wife is a social worker.
05:24
She lives her entire day in process and is entirely focused on it, and she has
05:30
experiences in which all people talk about is the process by which they interact.
05:35
We’re not likely to
05:40
do any of that, or if we do, it’s only in a very
05:45
artificial and almost, ludicrous fashion.
05:50
We’re not, we ain’t good at it, and we’ve never been good at.
05:54
And we don’t have people who are naturally, are leaders in that
05:58
way, although there could be.
05:59
I suspect there are people who actually could play more of a role in that
06:03
than they’ve been allowed to, in part because we don’t acknowledge that
06:07
something is an important ingredient.
06:07
Where was
06:10
I going with that?
06:12
I think, well I was talking about Jerry, and so it’s like a conflict
06:17
that happened in the past, and we don’t really look to that part of the history.
06:23
It’s like, that was then and this is now.
06:26
It’s a little bit like a family that wants to just forget about feuds,
06:33
or divorces, or what have you.
06:34
Sounds like some discussions do take place take place between individuals.
06:38
That’s exactly right.
06:40
Well I’ve taken up two hours of your time.
