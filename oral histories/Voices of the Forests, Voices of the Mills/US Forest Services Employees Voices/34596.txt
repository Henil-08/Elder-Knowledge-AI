00:00
The way I start these things is first to have you talk a little bit about
00:00
yourself and background, and then we’ll move through the interview and
00:13
you’ll
00:41
talk more about what sorts of activities you
00:48
do.
00:48
To start off, if I recall this right, you mentioned that you started
00:51
as a post-doc with the Andrews about a year-and-a-half ago after
00:54
completing your Ph.D. at Oklahoma?
00:56
Yeah.
00:56
And you were in Puerto Rico in-between.
00:59
Is that right?
00:59
Well, I was involved in Puerto Rico at the Luquillo [Experimental Forest and LTER
01:02
site] site all during my graduate work.
01:04
Okay.
01:05
Maybe you could talk about the origins of your involvement in this line of
01:09
work, and your personal background?
01:14
I was in business for quite a few years in Montana, went back to school to finish
01:21
my undergraduate degree, and realized I liked water and ecology and geology.
01:26
I ended up looking at graduate programs because I realized I could
01:31
get paid for going to graduate school, [chuckle] as opposed to working.
01:37
Sure.
01:37
I had to choose between a couple of different areas, and ended up in
01:40
a zoology department doing stream ecology, as opposed to other ways I
01:45
could have gone in water research.
01:48
So, your undergraduate work was where?
01:52
U of M.
01:53
U of M?
01:53
Missoula [University of Montana]
01:55
Missoula?
01:56
Yes, and then I went to Oklahoma.
01:57
I intended just to get a master’s degree, and got talked into staying for a Ph.D.
02:02
Okay.
02:04
Who were your mentors or role models?
02:07
Alan Covich was my major professor, who is a P. I. at Luquillo.
02:11
That is how I got involved in Luquillo.
02:13
Okay.
02:14
He was down there on his sabbatical when I first arrived
02:16
and they just had the hurricane.
02:18
So, I got pulled into doing service follow-up work.
02:22
All I did was sideline.
02:23
And so he was my major professor for both my master’s and Ph.D.
02:29
Okay.
02:30
And he’s a department chair now.
02:31
He left and went to became the department chair for [or the period of] my Ph.D.
02:35
Okay.
02:35
Where’d he go?
02:36
Colorado State.
02:37
Okay.
02:37
In the Fish and Wildlife department.
02:40
When we were talking before about Colorado State, I wasn’t sure
02:43
what the connection there was.
02:47
Yeah.
02:47
Then, at the undergraduate level, was there someone that
02:49
steered you along the way?
02:51
Probably, Andy Sheldon.
02:53
He’s a fisheries guy.
02:58
But I also worked with a retired geologist named Al Engle, E-N-G-L-E,
03:13
who was retired up in Montana.
03:15
And your interest in forest research in the Northwest originates from
03:20
your involvement with the LTER program at the Luquillo site?
03:22
I was
03:25
involved with forest issues in Montana as a conservation person.
03:32
That’s just as a volunteer.
03:34
I’d worked for the Forest Service there as a seasonal, and saw what went on.
03:39
So, I had that strong background of being involved, but not having the
03:45
science component to add to it, so I was real interested to add the science.
03:51
It only ends up muddling everything, you know.
03:52
The outside person can say, “Oh, it’s black and white,” you have
03:55
all these issues, and then, the more you learn, the grayer it gets.
03:58
Was there a particular issue in Montana that caught your
04:02
attention and drew you into this?
04:04
The streams there are pretty heavily hit.
04:07
They dry up in the summer.
04:08
Okay.
04:09
It gets to be a big issue.
04:11
They always think fisheries versus forestry versus irrigation
04:15
versus not much water in the first place, making a real issue.
04:20
You said you were drawn up to Montana from Kansas?
04:25
Years ago.
04:25
For different reasons.
04:25
Yeah, just traveling.
04:27
Okay.
04:27
Back in the old days.
04:27
[Laughs]
04:27
Like a lot of westerners, you’ve been to a lot of places it sounds like.
04:27
[Laughs] Would you talk to me about your level of experience or
04:29
previous experience with the LTER
04:42
program in Puerto Rico?
04:43
And you said you’ve interviewed with Hubbard Brook also?
04:44
Uh-huh [affirmative], with Gene
04:47
Likens.
04:48
What was your initial impression of the H.J. Andrews in
04:51
relation to that experience?
04:53
I first started interacting with the HJA people at Puerto Rico.
04:58
Fred Swanson was an outside reviewer at some of the Andrews’ review meetings.
05:04
[Swanson was in Puerto Rico to help write two Luquillo LTER proposals] So, I met
05:05
him then, and interacted again with him at the 1990 All-Scientists LTER Meeting.
05:14
My major professor was very good about including me in these
05:18
different science levels and at different meetings, so I started
05:19
attending the All-Scientists Meeting
05:22
in ‘90 and then again in ‘93.
05:25
By the time I met Fred again at the All-Scientists Meeting in ‘90, I had
05:30
heard a little bit about the Andrews and was intrigued, because it was
05:34
a research site in the Northwest.
05:37
And I’d heard some about Oregon State [University] having
05:40
a strong fisheries program.
05:42
So, to see some of the ideas that were coming out of the Andrews, and
05:46
as I’d took classes, I realized a lot of research had happened up at
05:50
the Andrews that was reflected in the literature we were studying.
05:56
So, I had a real positive impression of it.
05:59
But I also interacted with Fred, and saw how he had a more gestalt feeling about
06:08
landscapes and streams and was real drawn to that, rather than just
06:12
trying to study streams in isolation.
06:15
Would you say you had a general understanding or general exposure
06:17
to some of the work that was done on streams down there, but that it was
06:21
also personal interactions with Fred?
06:25
Yeah.
06:26
Then, I interacted with Gordon [Grant] quite a bit at
06:32
several other LTER meetings, the ‘93 meeting, as well as an
06:37
inter-site hydrology meeting I just picked, and Gordon organized.
06:40
I was an LTER representative to look at
06:45
hydrologic modeling and work with sites.
06:49
That was in ‘94.
06:50
In ’93, I also ended up sharing a room at the All-Scientists
06:57
Meeting with Julia [Jones] , so I got to know her through that.
07:00
I hadn’t met her before.
07:03
She was fairly new here.
07:05
I was going to say, she came up in other discussions.
07:08
Yeah.
07:09
So, it was kind of interesting, but also, as much as anything, when
07:12
you’re looking at stream literature and forest-stream interactions, the
07:16
Andrews is the place that a lot of that initial research has come about, and
07:20
some of the very leading-edge research.
07:22
I think you mentioned, quickly, but maybe you could mention some
07:23
of the things you were working on
07:29
in those studies at Puerto Rico.
07:31
Okay.
07:31
In Puerto Rico,
07:35
I got pulled into it right after the hurricane.
07:37
My major professor was on sabbatical, the hurricane came, our sampling regime was
07:43
to increase dramatically to try and follow the effects of the hurricane, and so I
07:47
was basically pulled in as an extra hand.
07:50
We would come for a bit in Puerto Rico from Oklahoma, as
07:53
I was still based in Oklahoma.
07:55
They were looking at the effects of the disturbance on the stream community.
07:59
The disturbance being the hurricane, but also all the
08:04
debris that came into the stream
08:09
from the treetops.
08:09
And then, whether there was wash-out of the stream
08:13
communities.
08:14
Interestingly, by following disturbances and ending up here [Andrews Forest]
08:18
after the floods and working on that disturbance, too, I’m kind
08:22
of a disturbance chaser, I guess.
08:24
I always seem to arrive there right after the disturbances.
08:27
You got here right after the floods [Feb]
08:28
? Uh-huh.
08:28
Okay.
08:29
In June, after the floods, and then ended up doing a channel study to look
08:33
at the effects of the flood and stuff.
08:36
Great.
08:36
But that work was interesting because it was, probably, an early tie to the
08:43
effects of forests with the streams.
08:47
Worked some on woody debris dynamics and the breakdown of the debris
08:51
dams that came into the stream.
08:53
We looked at the population abundances of fresh water shrimp along an
08:58
elevational gradient from the headwaters down about a kilometer.
09:03
So, that research is part of the long-term research that goes on, but we were
09:07
specifically interested in comparing some of Alan’s [Covich] before the
09:10
hurricane data, to after the hurricane.
09:15
As I was involved with Puerto Rico more, I ended up doing some work with the Forest
09:20
Service down there in the International Institute of Tropical Forestry.
09:23
Okay.
09:24
Which is the component similar to PNW as part of U.S. Forest Service research.
09:29
Some issues had come up about instream flows and [water] extraction.
09:34
They were going to be taking quite a bit of water.
09:37
The public authority was going to put in a proposal to take quite a
09:40
bit of water from one of the streams.
09:42
One of the last free-flowing streams draining the forest, and because we had
09:46
the long-term data on the shrimp, we were trying to use some of our long-term
09:49
data [to give input on] management [of streamflow] . That research has
09:56
come along and we’ve made recommendations, and there will be a Forest Service
10:01
publication coming out of it.
10:01
So, there
10:09
was a strong applied aspect.
10:09
Right.
10:09
Aside from your major professor, who were some of the people you
10:11
collaborated with down there?
10:11
In Puerto Rico?
10:11
Right.
10:11
Rex Cachina is the hydrologist, the U.S. Forest Service hydrologist down
10:12
there, and those are the main folks.
10:14
It’s
10:28
like any LTER site where there is a whole big group.
10:31
Yeah, sure.
10:32
I was curious if you might have any impressions on the relative degree
10:35
of interaction of scientists and staff with students or post-docs.
10:36
Puerto Rico is a little hard, because
10:47
it has 22 investigators from 19 different universities, only one of which is local.
10:55
So, almost everybody is from the mainland.
10:58
Everybody is coming and going, actually overlapping down there,
11:02
so it’s sometimes hard to arrange.
11:04
They do have an annual meeting where everybody tries to show up, but because
11:10
of the logistics it’s a lot harder to communicate, a lot harder to keep
11:14
projects, continuity in projects, going.
11:18
The staff has a little bit more turnover, being a Hispanic country [U.S.
11:22
territory] . Not having quite so many scientists-in-residence, it becomes a
11:27
lot harder to get projects going and then kind of having to keep them going,
11:29
and having [to deal with] absenteeism.
11:32
Like, people can do [at the Andrews] , if it’s only an hour drive and
11:35
you can check on them once a week.
11:35
So, there were problems with
11:40
projects starting and then stopping?
11:42
Yeah, continuity of projects.
11:43
People tend not to try and do those long-term projects,
11:45
follow-through projects.
11:46
You go in and sample for a week and leave, kind of bounce back.
11:50
People come and go quite a bit.
11:52
The field station is much smaller, so in some ways it’s a little more intimate,
11:56
and you interact with a lot more people.
11:59
But in some ways it’s a hindrance, too, because it’s kind of
12:01
small and it gets overwhelmed.
12:04
But it is interesting, and you end up in the kitchen sharing one stove with a
12:09
variety of other scientists and student researchers and staff and technicians.
12:15
So, the communication is
12:20
a lot more open because the way people are running into each other
12:25
right in the middle of when they’re trying to get their research done.
12:27
I was wondering in terms of the site itself.
12:31
At the Andrews, my impression was that there’s a flurry of activities
12:36
around the summer and fall.
12:38
I was curious if Puerto Rico, if that would be more continuous during the year?
12:43
It’s really crazy there in the summer because so many students
12:46
are down there, and technicians are down there working on projects.
12:49
The breaks tend to be a lot busier too.
12:52
People tend to arrive after Christmas, before school
12:56
starts, as well as Spring Break.
12:57
Those are times that you kind of get that you don’t want to be
12:59
down there because it’s so hectic.
13:02
Otherwise, it is a tropical site so it’s not quite the seasonal dynamics
13:08
we see here, but because so many people are tied into universities, you don’t
13:12
see a whole lot of activity in the fall and other times within the spring.
13:21
One guy that’s involved in the stream group is taking sabbaticals down there.
13:25
People tend to do that kind of research more, or not teach for
13:30
a quarter and be down there.
13:31
But it really thins out.
13:32
There’s been quite a few times at that field station that I’ve
13:35
been the only person there.
13:38
And it’s a Forest Service Station,
13:42
the whole forest itself, the Caribbean National Forest, is probably only as
13:45
big as the HJA Experimental Forest.
13:47
Oh.
13:49
Yeah, a lot more urban pressure.
13:54
How would you characterize the site in relation to the Andrews?
14:00
The H.J. Andrews these days is much more lush.
14:06
The facilities are much nicer and they’re maintained.
14:13
There’s just more space being there in the flat.
14:15
Puerto Rico has kind of very marginal facilities, and they’re in
14:18
the process of growing, so they’re probably like the Andrews was
14:21
before all the dorms were built.
14:23
Sounds like if you went back to the Andrews site in the trailer
14:25
days, it’d be pretty much
14:28
the same?
14:28
Yeah,
14:32
but I wasn’t there for the trailer days.
14:34
You might have mentioned this previously, I’m not sure.
14:34
Had you previously been out to the Northwest before
14:36
you came out here to work?
14:38
I’d traveled through.
14:41
And living in Montana, we’d occasionally come over to Oregon.
14:45
Okay.
14:45
Can you recall your first impressions of the landscape?
14:50
Of the forest?
14:50
The Andrews?
14:51
Yeah, the forest, in relation to your expectations.
14:55
I
15:01
remember thinking how plush the site was.
15:06
I went up initially on a tour when I came out to interview
15:11
for the post-doc I was on.
15:14
We teased about it being a “trial by rain,” because it was one of
15:16
those horrendous spring rainstorms.
15:22
The whole idea of working in such a wet area was real different to me. I’d thought
15:27
of the Andrews probably more in terms of montane forests, than quite so wet.
15:34
So that was interesting.
15:36
And the facilities, the
15:41
greenness.
15:44
My first tour up there was just a month or two after the floods.
15:49
So, we were down looking at those dynamics.
15:54
Sounds like you did some traveling around the Northwest before you came out here.
15:57
How would you compare the H.J. Andrews with other sites around the Northwest?
16:01
Other forests?
16:03
Well, I
16:07
guess the only other experimental forest I could compare it to would
16:11
be something like the Lubrecht [Experimental] Forest in Montana.
16:13
Which?
16:13
Lubrecht Experimental Forest.
16:17
It’s run by the university [U.
16:19
of Montana] . I’ve been in a variety of Forest Service situations and camps,
16:23
but the Andrews seems very integrated.
16:28
Or I see it being very integrated with the university as well as in its research,
16:32
with the traditional forest management folks, the Willamette National Forest.
16:38
I’m real impressed with interactions that go on between the researchers
16:41
and the National Forest folks.
16:44
What’s the proper way to call them?
16:48
Forest managers?
16:49
Yeah, forest management.
16:50
Willamette folks are much more interactive people, like John Cissel.
16:54
I think that kind of a position is really unusual, but it’s becoming more common.
16:59
Hubbard Brook has an outreach person, Coweeta now has an outreach person.
17:05
David Post helped organize an inter-site hydrology meeting we had at the Andrews
17:11
last week on Thursday and Friday.
17:12
So again, I was interacting with some of the Forest Service folks, some
17:16
of the Puerto Rico folks were there, some of the Coweeta folks, Hubbard
17:20
Brook, a couple of these sites.
17:22
It was interesting to talk about facilities and the
17:25
amount of research going on.
17:27
The Andrews is an older site than I’ve been at before.
17:32
In terms of research?
17:33
Yeah, in terms of length of research.
17:37
And you’re so familiar with the
17:42
literature that’s come out of the Andrews before I arrived.
17:44
But it was fun to actually see some of the “River Continuum” sites, the
17:51
clear-cut, whatever’s there on Mack Creek, where some of the early studies
17:57
of effects of clear cuts on fish.
17:58
Uh-huh [affirmative].
17:59
Things like that.
18:01
Did you have a sense of the research community already established before?
18:04
Oh yeah.
18:07
How?
18:08
Especially with the big names that have come through here.
18:13
You mentioned Fred Swanson.
18:15
Were there other people that you knew about?
18:16
Well, I knew Jim Sedell’s name, and
18:22
Ken Cummins has come through here.
18:24
I don’t know Ken very well, but it’s a name you know quite
18:27
a bit within stream ecology.
18:28
And then just a whole number of people that have come through here
18:31
on post-docs and graduate students.
18:36
You were talking briefly about some other experimental
18:38
forests, and I thought maybe you
18:42
could explain how you might characterize your understanding of the
18:44
proper role of experimental forests
18:49
at the time you came out here.
18:52
At the time I came?
18:52
First of all, your conceptions at that time
18:56
of what you expected an experimental forest to accomplish, and then, how
18:58
the HJA fit that model, or didn’t.
19:00
Well, I think it fits pretty well.
19:02
It seems like one of the more interactive forests that I’ve seen.
19:07
Not that I have that broad an experience
19:11
with them.
19:12
We’re looking at how are we managing our forests, and taking those results back
19:16
to the managers and saying, “Yes, this is, and no, this isn’t working,” and
19:20
being a place where adaptive management is being experimented with on a small
19:26
scale before it’s taken into the larger
19:36
arena.
19:36
Could
19:39
you describe what your professional priority here
19:47
is?
19:48
How do you characterize your research goals here as far as what you’re
19:54
trying accomplish as a scientist?
19:55
I’m here on an NSF post-doctoral fellowship.
19:59
So, I’m actually being paid by NSF and routed specifically
20:03
to work at the Andrews.
20:05
And I think
20:08
that in their guidelines NSF encourages you to work at an LTER site because
20:12
of the broad nature and the exposure that the post-docs would get.
20:18
My personal goals are to be in a very dynamic research group.
20:24
I had felt fairly isolated in graduate school, being in Oklahoma and
20:28
trying to do collaborative research.
20:30
I was in a department where there weren’t really other people
20:33
working on what I was working on.
20:35
I was working across departments quite a bit, but there wasn’t any kind of
20:38
a model for transmuting those things.
20:40
People just kind of thought I was strange.
20:50
[Chuckle] The site I was working on was an agricultural research site,
20:53
which is kind of an agricultural model of an experiment forest.
20:58
So, we had people from a couple different universities, and maybe
21:02
different departments within those universities, working together.
21:06
It was hard to get it rolling and keep it rolling and keep the communication.
21:11
I was really looking forward to coming to a place where I
21:14
would have lots of interaction.
21:17
Being here at the Andrews, I feel like, instead of I’m the only person
21:21
doing what I’m doing, I’m one of many.
21:25
So, it’s kind of a different challenge of creating your own identity within this
21:29
group of many, rather than just being the only one and trying to do what you do.
21:31
Would you say that’s a more supportive environment for this kind of work?
21:36
Yeah.
21:38
It’s more supportive, and it’s a lot more intellectually stimulating,
21:42
because there are so many other people doing things you feed off of.
21:48
You’re
21:51
kind of weaving in and out of what you’re doing.
21:54
My proposed project here, is specifically to look at the effect
21:58
of stream temperatures, so it’s a fairly basic research question
22:04
about what are the processes and mechanisms driving stream temperatures.
22:07
But it also has a real applied side, especially in Oregon these days, which I
22:11
didn’t realize was quite such a hot issue until I arrived and started working on
22:18
it.
22:18
The State of Oregon is listing its 303[d] streams [streams not complying with
22:21
Clean Water Act water quality standards] , and it’s a really controversial issue.
22:23
So,
22:27
my research is kind of on the edge of that, but much more in the basic arena.
22:33
Also, while I was waiting to start accumulating some data, I got real
22:37
involved doing follow up work, and will end up continuing on with that for a
22:44
little while after my post-doc is over.
22:47
We were looking at geomorphic changes, so we’ll do a co-op agreement with
22:51
the Forest Service to arrive at those results when my post-doc
22:59
is done.
22:59
That’s been interesting because I’m not trained as a geomorphologist,
23:04
so that’s a new training for me to be doing this work and to be
23:10
involved in issues at the regional Forest Service level, rather
23:15
than just an individual forest.
23:23
What you’re saying is that was kind of a fortuitous spinoff in your other work.
23:30
One clarification, I
23:35
think you might have mentioned it, but who encouraged you or sponsored
23:36
you to write the NSF fellowship?
23:39
Someone at the Andrews?
23:40
Oh, I hit up Julia [Jones] . But, people here are so busy, it’s hard.
23:49
I’d actually talked to Stan [Gregory] at one point about doing a post-doc with
23:52
him, and he would say, “Yeah, it’s a nice idea,” but following through was hard.
23:59
I hit up Julia when I met her at the ‘93 meeting, and shared a room.
24:04
I asked if she needed a post-doc, knowing I wanted to work out here, and
24:09
I said, “I’m just kind of looking around for opportunities that might bring me
24:13
out here after my graduate work was done,” then kind of let that slide. She
24:17
[Jones] said, “Oh, I’m not ready for a post-doc,” as she was busy with this
24:20
and that. I saw her again at a meeting, an ESA meeting, about a year-and-a-half
24:25
later, and thought I’d mention it again.
24:27
She said, “Well, let’s talk about it.” So, I followed up and ran some ideas
24:32
by her, wrote some things and sent them out to her, and submitted it that way.
24:43
We threw some ideas around of what she might be interested in.
24:45
Because I was interested in learning more of her techniques on spatial
24:48
analysis, trying to take stream research to more of a landscape-scale,
24:53
rather than just the reach-scale most stream research focuses on.
24:58
I had that interest.
25:00
They’d been working on landscape issues in Oklahoma, and landscape ecology
25:05
in general, so it was interested in getting some of those technical skills.
25:07
So, you just started out with some
25:10
kind of informal inquiries [areas of interest]
25:12
. And then, talked to Gordon [Grant] , some of his publications which I read.
25:12
But, both of them were also very
25:16
busy.
25:18
I made
25:25
initial contact with some of the more prominent scientists here, but
25:30
following through with them is hard,
25:34
unless they had a specific project they needed somebody for.
25:36
So, I was kind of putting it out that I was going to be looking, and if they
25:40
had a specific project come up, I’d be interested in talking to them about it.
25:45
But nothing was really coming up, and so, it took my own initiative
25:48
to write a proposal and get funding.
25:53
It was some kind of a fortuitous circumstance on one hand,
25:55
and persistence on the other.
25:56
Yes.
25:57
Persistence plays a big role in working with a group like this, because they are
26:05
so busy.
26:05
I was wondering if you could characterize your thinking about research on the
26:07
site at the Andrews, your level of involvement with the people there
26:11
on-site, and how important is the kind of research that they do?
26:16
The researchers on-site, or the post-docs?
26:18
Post-docs or the scientists.
26:23
The research support staff is really good at the Andrews, and very helpful.
26:31
Greg [Downing] and Don [Henshaw] and Fred and all those folks, help quite a bit.
26:36
Both in terms of trying to do some of the historic work I’m doing with the Andrews
26:39
with the stream temperature data records, from historical studies to the present.
26:44
For other researchers, I’m not sure I interact with them as much at
26:49
the Andrews as I do here on campus.
26:55
Folks like the geomorphologists and the hydro group, what we call it, and
27:00
graduate students through geosciences, that are all working on physical processes
27:03
of streams, as well as the stream team tying into biological work they’re doing.
27:10
I had been more formally-trained as a biologist than a geomorphologist, but
27:14
being here in this building and initially doing some geomorphology, I kind of get
27:20
thrown into those camps a little bit more.
27:22
And then
27:26
that thing of Stan Gregory going on sabbatical, so an opportunity
27:32
came up for me to get some teaching experience by filling in for him
27:35
when he goes off on sabbatical.
27:36
Was
27:39
that a goal when you came here, to get into teaching?
27:41
I’m not sure it’s a goal, but it’s an important experience
27:49
to get someplace along the way.
27:54
Maybe, if I wasn’t going to train, but do it in this situation which meant
28:00
more formally approaches and trying to create a summer class or a short-term
28:05
class or somehow to get some more teaching experience, especially if you
28:07
want to do any kind of academic job.
28:09
For what comes next, I need to have that in my records, in my skills bag.
28:14
You’re kind of anticipating my next question here.
28:16
I was going to ask what your overall career goals are, where do
28:21
you see yourself going in the future?
28:22
I really like the research aspects.
28:24
Traditional teaching hasn’t called to me before, but it will be interesting
28:30
to get that experience and see how much I like it this next couple of quarters.
28:37
My ideal job would
28:41
probably be to become a research scientist.
28:44
With an agency?
28:44
With an agency, probably.
28:47
I realize there’s bureaucratic problems with any group.
28:51
But to do something like that, or where there is very personalized teaching.
28:57
I like working with small groups of people and being an educator in that sense.
29:01
The traditional lecture is not maybe the most efficient way to be learning.
29:07
I end up working with a lot of students, but I work with them much more hands-on.
29:12
Whether it be other people’s students that hit me up as a post-doc here, and
29:16
an unemployed bunch of students last fall for this geomorphology work, or
29:21
people that aren’t really students anymore, but maybe just finished their
29:23
undergraduate program and are kind of in transition looking for their next project.
29:27
You hired folks before?
29:29
Yeah, I’ve hired an assortment of folks and students in different
29:33
roles as young technicians.
29:38
And I like working with people on that level.
29:40
A
29:43
lot of it is you can’t always have
29:48
exactly the job you want.
29:49
If you want to go for specific jobs, then you can’t choose your region.
29:54
Do
30:06
you tend to work with someone like that on a day-to-day basis, with the other
30:11
scientists, other people in the group?
30:14
I probably go both ways.
30:16
I do that quite a bit with other scientists.
30:19
Dan and Judy [Li
30:26
or Meyer?] and Gordon [Grant] primarily, and Julia [Jones] and Fred [Swanson] also.
30:28
Organizationally, because
30:32
I’m used to having employees, it’s pretty easy to have students
30:36
and get them going on projects.
30:39
They’re not actually my students, but I have student workers.
30:41
I’m involved with data management levels or having them do this or do
30:46
that, so I connect kind of both ways.
30:49
I see myself very much as an in-between person.
30:52
I
31:00
wanted to ask you about your relationship between your career goals
31:05
and where you see your research going.
31:08
I think we touched on
31:13
this just a minute ago when we were talking a little bit about regional
31:15
location versus targeted jobs.
31:15
What are some other specific research goals or an agenda that you want
31:20
to try to accomplish in the future?
31:22
I
31:29
think my main interest is integrating studies, a broader
31:37
understanding of interdisciplinary studies of streams and organisms.
31:46
I don’t think I could compromise that for the type of job I would
31:49
want to do, but there are lots of different ways to do that within jobs.
31:54
In terms of regional work,
31:59
especially being a person who likes to work at the big scale, I see
32:01
so many studies that go on at such a fine scale, the results aren’t
32:06
really applicable to anywhere else.
32:08
I see it being really important to do regional studies
32:15
and be able to talk about the bigger processes and mechanisms.
32:20
So, it’s not just a case study of this and a case study of that.
32:24
I think our science is changing quite a bit in how we can do it and how we need
32:28
to get our research out to the public.
32:34
One of the questions I’ve been trying to grapple with
32:44
here is what people identify as their target audience.
32:48
Who are they writing for?
32:49
Who are they doing research for?
32:51
What’s the purpose of the group, basically?
32:54
A lot of it depends on your job description.
32:57
And what you have to pay the piper for, depending on who you’re working for and
33:03
depending on how you’re being evaluated.
33:05
So, I get pulled between needing to get results out to the primary, scientific
33:12
literature, because that’s how I will be evaluated for any kind of further jobs.
33:18
My publication record is everything in science these days, as well as you
33:24
could do all these other things, too.
33:25
But your publication record is your main credibility.
33:29
But that’s not necessarily getting out to the general public.
33:32
I
33:35
was just at a meeting this morning with the stream team group,
33:38
talking about making some changes.
33:42
We really need to work with these different departments and kind
33:44
of use Oak Creek as a model.
33:47
And wanting to do those kinds of things, but yet if I get distracted with that
33:53
[could be a distraction] . I haven’t had funding to do it.
33:58
I have interests but I also have to watch out to keep my funding
34:02
together, especially if I’m going to do the soft money game for a while.
34:08
I tend to get involved in environmental issues, local ecological groups and
34:13
education projects, wherever I am, the Willamette River Education Project
34:19
and those kinds of local things, because I feel that’s important.
34:25
But, you have to be really careful about keeping your
34:29
credibility up at the same time.
34:32
So, your number one goal
34:36
audience is professional.
34:38
Is that what you’re saying?
34:40
Publications, and then your other additional concerns you try to work in.
34:46
Right.
34:51
You mentioned the Oak Creek issue.
34:53
Any other local community issues that you’ve been involved with here lately?
34:55
Well, I’ve gotten pulled in looking at stream temperatures.
34:55
I’ve given a couple of talks this year already to a local
35:01
agency group of industry
35:07
folks about stream temperature, as well as a water quality
35:11
group about stream temperature.
35:13
I’ve talked quite a bit in different venues, having done this with geomorphic
35:19
channel work to different agency groups of managers about floods and related
35:25
issues, whether it be tours up at the Andrews, or whether we’re actually going
35:29
to other forests and talking about the research we’re doing here on floods.
35:34
And kind of what we’re beginning to feel are the drivers and the most important
35:38
factors that are influences of the flood, and what that did to stream habitats.
35:45
I’m involved with some local issues, and I’m involved with some forest issues.
35:47
I’m involved with
35:51
some agricultural issues, although not quite as much, but stream
35:52
temperature is becoming much more of an agricultural issue.
35:58
Looking back on it, can you think of any of those kinds of involvements that you
36:03
might chalk up to personal success of something, how you accomplish something?
36:08
I tend not to think I’m
36:12
really making that much of an impact.
36:13
So, it’s mainly informational
36:18
roles that you’re talking about, participating in the process?
36:24
Yes.
36:24
Right.
36:24
As opposed to affecting management?
36:24
Yeah, I’m much more
36:32
of a process person.
36:33
What are your perceptions of the community at Blue River, the
36:36
McKenzie Valley, as it relates to
36:40
your community of scientists?
36:41
How would you characterize the interactions?
36:42
I haven’t interacted that much outside the Blue River Ranger
36:45
Station, and the folks that live up there and work at the station.
36:49
I haven’t really interacted that much with the McKenzie River Valley.
36:52
I know there’s the McKenzie Watershed Council,
37:01
which are involved citizens trying to drive the process, but I personally
37:04
haven’t gotten a hold of any of that yet.
37:06
So, it seems
37:12
we see the fishing industry being pretty active
37:18
up there.
37:18
In terms of going down to do your work, do you kind of stay on site
37:24
for long periods of time, or do you go drive down there and drive down?
37:29
Last fall, when I was doing the channel work, I was down there five days a
37:32
week and would come home on weekends.
37:35
We were rushing to get the
37:40
streams inventoried before the next high-water event, so we started in
37:44
September, knew the rains were going to start at some point, and wondered how
37:47
much could we get done before the rain?
37:49
So, I was pretty much living down there.
37:51
And I’d kind of come and go through the summer, and then not be down there much in
37:56
the winter, but then, again, this spring and summer, I was down there off and on.
38:01
Usually, I’d drive down and spend one to two nights, and then come
38:07
back.
38:08
You usually spent that time on site then?
38:10
At the headquarter site?
38:11
Yeah.
38:11
It’s probably a naive question, given the kind of time you’re talking about.
38:18
Did you have time for recreational activities while you were down there?
38:23
Sometimes I do.
38:26
But in some ways, the research I do is, is almost like recreational, I
38:31
mean it’s not recreating, but it fills a lot of those needs that recreation
38:35
does in terms of walking and taking hikes in the woods, dinking around
38:40
in the streams and seeing new sites, and traveling through other areas.
38:46
That’s why I like it.
38:47
It’s
38:51
the ideal job for me, being able to be out and enjoy those things.
38:55
And on hot days I’ll quit early and go jump in the reservoir, things like that.
39:02
But I haven’t been based there that much, so I get restless
39:05
and start going other places
39:09
from there.
39:09
It doesn’t sound like you’re go down to the community of Blue River
39:12
much for leisure- time activities.
39:15
No, I haven’t checked out the restaurants, and I’m not really invested down there.
39:23
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your perceptions of
39:27
the Blue River Ranger District.
39:29
You’ve touched on this, your interactions with the national
39:32
forest and staff out there.
39:36
Would you characterize that as important to your research, the
39:36
kind of research that you do?
39:45
They interact more through the monthly meetings and up at the station
39:51
than I had expected them to, based on my working at, say, Luquillo.
39:59
It’s maybe because of time pressures and lack of continuity down there, it’s
40:04
a little bit harder to make connections with management folks at Luquillo.
40:08
Here, the folks at Blue River are very interested, they’re very interactive.
40:14
I wouldn’t say that it’s necessarily critical to my research, but it’s
40:19
an important outlet for my results.
40:23
I do make a conscious effort to connect with them, and let them know what
40:28
I’m doing and what the issues are.
40:30
Whether it be their hydrologist, who’s kind of doing similar studies,
40:33
and talking with her, or when I was doing site selection for geomorphology
40:37
work, I spent quite a bit of time down there with the folks looking at their
40:40
maps and using them as a resource.
40:43
Who’s the hydrologist there that you interacted with?
40:45
It had been Michelle McSwain, but she’s moved now.
40:50
And their GIS person was very helpful in terms of trying to look at access
40:57
to streams and being new in the area.
40:59
I wasn’t sure how much we had here through people like George Lienkaemper, who’s very
41:04
valuable, but also just the local folks.
41:09
So, we’ve worked quite a bit with them.
41:12
Do you recall who the GIS person was?
41:14
No, I don’t.
41:14
That’s okay.
41:15
And then people like the forest hydrologist, Deigh Bates.
41:19
Deigh?
41:21
Deigh, D-e-i-g-h- B-a-t-e-s, Forest Hydrologist for the Willamette Forest.
41:28
He’s very interactive and has helped fund some of the sensors I bought, has
41:36
been interested and really encourages interaction with research folks.
41:43
I also interacted with them quite a bit last summer, arranging for
41:48
aerial photography to try and look at the effects of the flood.
41:51
The forest [Will.
41:51
NF] wasn’t going to get it done, and we were pushing to get it done
41:54
for the Andrews, or I was pushing to get it done for the Andrews,
41:57
so that we’d have a record.
41:59
Because after the ‘64 floods, it was a couple of years before some
42:02
of this stuff was done, and even if we saw no immediate use for it,
42:06
it was something I was pushing for.
42:07
So, I interacted quite a bit with different folks, and tried
42:10
to do it through the forest [Willamette NF] . It wasn’t going
42:11
to happen, so I tried to do it.
42:12
That’s fairly expensive, it sounds like?
42:15
Uh-huh.
42:16
At
42:22
least initially?
42:23
I’m pretty much a networker.
42:25
So, those things come naturally, and trying to get something done, you
42:30
just sort of keep going until you find somebody that knows what you’re
42:33
talking about and can help you.
42:35
And they ended up helping with the aerial imagery, [it’s] just [a
42:36
matter of figuring out] who to [ask for help] and what [to ask for]
42:36
. And if I heard you right, it sounds like that was
42:45
when you first came here and you were not quite as involved in
42:48
-- ? Uh-huh.
42:49
-- other responsibilities here yet, so you became more aware of
42:51
people like George Lienkaemper?
42:52
Uh-huh.
42:53
So, you shifted more in that direction?
42:55
No.
42:56
I still use these other folks quite a bit.
42:57
I mean, George [Lienkaemper] is pretty focused on other jobs,
43:00
and George is very helpful
43:04
for certain layers, but some of those layers that I’m looking for,
43:08
people haven’t asked him for yet.
43:09
So, then I go back to the Forest [Andrews] and kind of arrange for
43:14
them to get some of these layers.
43:18
Especially because I not only worked within the Andrews,
43:21
but within this bigger area.
43:23
I ended up working all the way down
43:29
the McKenzie River.
43:32
Our
43:34
study
43:38
ended up
43:44
dealing with
43:49
quite a bit of private land.
43:50
By working through a couple of ranger districts and private land
43:52
[folks] , we could get the resources.
43:54
And they’re also doing the same thing up on Fish Creek in the Clackamas District.
44:00
So, you’re finding yourself drawn more to the regional
44:13
aspect.
44:13
While you were developing networks around campus, I’m curious how you
44:18
might characterize the research climate at Oregon State University compared to
44:21
some of the other places you’ve gone, like University of Montana and Oklahoma.
44:21
I gather at Oklahoma you weren’t real excited about the opportunities for
44:32
collaborative research?
44:34
People were much more disciplinary-based there.
44:37
Here, I find things being much more interactive and interdisciplinary.
44:41
I’m amazed at the number of people in soft money at this university, kind of
44:47
like Colorado State, but we have the Forest Science Department, which has
44:51
so many people that they’re calling faculty, but yet, they’re not paying them.
44:56
[Chuckle] They’re responsible for their own budgets; to me, that’s unusual.
45:01
It’s kind of typical of the West in terms of budgetary constraints, versus
45:04
places that have a little more money.
45:05
Oklahoma had quite a bit more money.
45:10
Actually, I applied to come here, or was accepted to come here for
45:13
my Ph.D. work, and that was about the time that Proposition 5 [tax
45:18
limitation measure] went through.
45:18
Yeah.
45:18
That was good timing.
45:19
So, I bailed out and stayed where there was money for education.
45:26
Oregon is fairly typical of the western states [U.S.] in terms of
45:30
the state support they can give towards research and education.
45:34
It’s nothing compared to the Midwest.
45:38
Yet, people still want to be here enough and they count on that, so
45:41
they [western U.S. universities/OSU] kind of take advantage of it.
45:43
But I find the researchers are much more interdisciplinary.
45:48
The departments are set up a little oddly to me.
45:51
But people are working across the departmental lines so much.
45:56
If I understood you right, you’re suggesting that’s because of
45:58
the higher number of research post-docs, rather than regular
46:02
faculty, or soft money appointments?
46:04
Correct?
46:04
Soft money.
46:05
Because some people here are on soft money, and make careers out of it.
46:11
That’s just unheard of in other places.
46:13
You don’t see people staying on soft money very long in Oklahoma.
46:18
So, your perception is those people would tend to be more interdisciplinary,
46:21
is that what you’re saying?
46:24
I’m not sure it’s those people.
46:26
I think it’s just the nature of the environment, or the community and
46:31
the research environment that makes people so much more interdisciplinary.
46:35
You realize you really can’t work on things in isolation.
46:37
And partly, that places like Oregon State are more leading
46:41
edge in some of these ideas.
46:43
So, these ideas will become more common elsewhere, eventually, but people in the
46:48
West or Northwest, are all here is to kind of push the envelope of how we deal with
46:59
things.
46:59
So, you’re saying that’s a characteristic of the campus?
47:00
Uh
47:00
-- Or
47:02
just the community?
47:04
I’d say most of the Northwest.
47:06
The liberal aspects of being in the Northwest, I think,
47:09
tends to encourage that.
47:11
But, the fact of having the interaction between state and federal
47:16
agencies with the campus right here, makes an interesting dynamic.
47:23
That happens on most campuses at some level, but how much they take advantage
47:27
of it and how much people, personally, tap in is a whole other matter.
47:31
I’m one of those that tends to tap into those things anyway, but here there is
47:34
just way more than I could ever tap into.
47:37
So, you’re kind of predisposed to seeking it out, but here you
47:40
find that it’s a lot easier to
47:45
seek it out or something?
47:46
Oh yeah.
47:46
What would you identify as your focus outside of the Andrews group?
47:52
Outside of the Andrews?
47:53
Yeah, beyond the Andrews group.
47:58
Here at Oregon State, you mean?
47:58
Yeah, or more generally.
48:00
Well, there’s still some colleagues from Oklahoma, folks I worked with there.
48:05
Grad students or faculty?
48:06
Faculty.
48:07
Okay.
48:10
You always make new ties through your major professor in that research group.
48:14
I still have manuscripts that need to get finished, and with Puerto
48:20
Rico folks, I’m involved on a cross-site study of LTER streams.
48:25
And so, kind of through that community.
48:25
Who’s working on the stream
48:33
study with you?
48:35
Stan and Linda [Ashkenas] are the folks here at the Andrews.
48:38
I’m officially involved in it down in Puerto Rico, and in the nine other sites
48:45
around the country where they’re doing it.
48:46
We’re all doing the exact same thing, and there’s a post-doc that travels [among
48:50
sites] . And then we’ll be able to, hopefully, compare across all these sites
48:53
with the same methodology of looking at [stream ecosystem] dynamics with nitrogen.
48:56
Are there any publications kind of outlining what you’re doing on that?
49:01
There’s a website.
49:03
But, the publications are starting to come out, there’s a website on.
49:07
It’s called the LINX, L-I-N-X
49:16
Project.
49:21
[Lotic
50:07
Inter-site Nitrogen Experiment]
50:09
Yeah, I’ve heard you talking about that at the Andrews.
50:10
Actually, if you talk to Linda [Ashkenas] , she was there.
50:10
She was just looking at the manuscript.
50:10
I could find it, but I don’t have it [presently]
50:10
. It would be helpful to me, though, if you might kind of briefly encapsulate kind
50:11
of what the goals were of that topic.
50:11
Of the
50:11
-- ? Of the cross-site study [LINX]
50:11
. It’s called the Lotic Inter-site Nitrogen Experiment [LINX] , and it takes a
50:12
similar methodology of releasing and fixing nitrogen into streams across many
50:18
sites, but at very, very low levels.
50:19
Not as fertilizer, but at very low levels.
50:22
And first doing the modeling of how you think this nitrogen will be distributed
50:28
throughout your stream community, and then sampling that after the release,
50:34
to see if that fits with the model.
50:37
We’re doing it on fairly small streams.
50:39
We’re looking at it through the different trophic levels, and
50:41
trying to see where it goes.
50:41
It is
50:44
a short-term release, I think it’s like a six-week release at each site.
50:47
The Andrews will be doing it next summer
50:53
in July and August.
50:53
We’re the last site.
50:54
It’s an interesting group.
50:55
It’s kind of one of those groups that’s evolved out of
50:58
the All-Scientists meetings.
51:01
The stream group would meet at the All-Scientists meetings and
51:03
it kind of evolved from there.
51:06
We got together at Coweeta about two years ago to write up the proposal.
51:09
So, you had kind of gestation period before that meeting?
51:10
Yes.
51:10
The LTER stream group is
51:20
very interactive, it has some very strong scientists, so
51:25
definitely it’s a real interesting group to be on the periphery of.
51:30
By no means do I consider myself a main player in it, but they’re good mentors.
51:35
Several people have mentioned that group as being particularly interactive.
51:40
Do you have any ideas why?
51:42
I
51:46
don’t know if it’s personality,
51:49
or
51:53
it might somewhat be the nature of streams, studying streams, because it’s
51:57
really hard to study streams in isolation.
52:01
They’re such integrators of everything going on around them.
52:04
So many people may have been pushed that way already.
52:08
But, I think also, different personalities like Judy Meyer
52:19
and some other folks kind of push
52:28
it.
52:28
You talked a little bit about this, too, but it’s focused in a little bit
52:31
here on the decision-making process, and then monthly meetings and other
52:36
mechanisms for managing the Andrews.
52:39
How would you characterize your level of involvement in that activity?
52:46
I guess I’d say that I’m an active supporter, or an active
52:50
attendee of the different groups and the different committees.
52:55
Partly being a post-doc, I have more free time than people who are, tightly-tied
53:00
into full-time teaching commitments and full-time research commitments.
53:05
So, I do have time to pursue that and I also have the
53:07
interest, because I’m involved.
53:10
Trying to trying to work with the climate group and trying to work with
53:13
the hydrology group, and because of my interdisciplinary work, having to
53:18
tie into these groups a little bit.
53:21
David Post and I have talked about that.
53:23
You come in from the outside, so post-docs are kind of the ones who
53:28
are not totally tied into the previous methodology, but yet you have energy
53:32
for the site and kind of can help make some changes and kind of challenge some
53:38
assumptions that people who are there all the time, kind of tend to get going on.
53:44
So, I feel like I’m fairly involved
53:52
within the LTER group.
53:52
And they’re also an open group to encouraging everybody.
53:58
You know they’re easy.
54:00
You show a little bit of interest and they realize they’ll get
54:02
something back, and they reel you in.
54:04
As Mark Harmon said when I first came out and was visiting, “You know,
54:08
I’ve gotten this grant.” I’ve kind of met some of the folks and have
54:10
proposed it to them and I got funding.
54:14
Oh good, a set of free hands.” So, that’s kind of how they are.
54:19
They’re more than willing to put that to use, and you have to be
54:22
kind of careful, any person does, so they don’t get too scattered by
54:25
it all, because there is so much to do and so many different ways to go.
54:30
And
54:33
as you pointed out earlier, the funding was attached to your grant.
54:37
Right.
54:39
You have to be careful about your social service work in terms
54:41
of your primary research work.
54:46
So, if I understood this right,
55:02
what you’re suggesting is that this flood of post-docs that comes to this
55:07
site, brings in some outside perspective and some vitality to the group that
55:13
complements these long-term approaches?
55:17
Yes.
55:17
I think they really do because, if you don’t have new energy coming
55:21
in, things do get real static.
55:25
So, between the researchers themselves teaching, and start pulling people
55:30
in, there are others of us that are more persistent and are just kind
55:34
of interested and get involved.
55:42
We’ve talked about the issue of an audience already.
55:47
How might you characterize the effectiveness of the Andrews
55:49
group in communicating its ideas?
55:52
How effective do you think they’ve been in proselytizing or letting people know
55:57
what they’re doing and its relevance?
55:58
I’m not sure I can evaluate that very well, because I’m looking at
56:02
it more from inside looking out.
56:04
So, I’m not sure how the public community thinks about it,
56:10
or the management community.
56:13
I was thinking along the lines of the last question I asked you about
56:15
your level of involvement in the management of [the Andrews program]
56:17
, and other goals that you see the group should be moving towards.
56:20
I think there are ways that we could be more efficient in getting those
56:28
results out and following up on that.
56:32
But, it’s not a project I’ve personally taken on to that next level.
56:39
And looking at communication within the group, communication takes
56:42
time and energy, and it’s one of those kinds of hard things to do.
56:47
The group seems to do it pretty well, but there’s ways we could
56:50
be a little more efficient at it.
56:53
Just even in
56:56
terms of interacting with our technical support people, several
57:01
of them had commented to me that they really wish there was more
57:06
interaction with the scientists.
57:07
Not only for their personal intellectual development, but just because they
57:13
don’t always feel like they’ve got enough guidance on the projects
57:15
that they’re supposed to be doing.
57:17
And they tend to look to post-docs or whoever is putting in energy
57:25
at that point, as a way to get some more of that information.
57:29
That’s the in-between level you were talking about earlier?
57:31
Yeah, whether it’d just be how the watersheds are gauged.
57:36
We arrived here and realized these watersheds were gauged, but they
57:38
hadn’t been recalibrated for 20 years.
57:42
You know, nobody, you kind of just get used to operating and it kind of
57:46
takes an outsider’s view, and then kind of trying to push that through.
57:49
And, maybe the researchers that are here are so busy, that are using
57:54
that data, don’t realize some of the gaps that might be happening
57:59
because they’re not tying back in quite as much to their field people.
58:02
So, some of that gets to be hard.
58:03
And mostly, all these scientists are just
58:05
so busy.
58:05
And
58:12
I guess I see that as one of my goals, to remain un-scattered and
58:23
distracted by it all.
58:24
To be able to say “No” to projects.
58:27
I mean there are lots of interesting projects that I’m
58:29
hopefully going to be able to
58:37
say “Yes” to.
58:38
It’s a challenge to find optimal effectiveness and not lose
58:45
effectiveness, or they [scientists] lose some quality of life there.
58:48
It may be their personal life that gets sacrificed, but they can continue
58:52
with being effective scientists.
58:55
It’s a hard thing.
59:02
I was curious about the role you played.
59:05
If technicians are coming to you and raising these problems, the question
59:10
that raises in my mind is what is it about a post-doc that they see
59:14
as more approachable perhaps?
59:16
Yeah, I think accessibility.
59:16
I think time.
59:18
And I’m
59:23
out in the field with a lot of the folks.
59:27
So, it’s just that daily interaction that
59:31
happens, too.
59:31
Would that be an example of interaction out at the Andrews?
59:34
Yeah, just running into each other at headquarters or something.
59:42
To at least establish that approachability, even if they don’t
59:46
run into me quite so much then.
59:49
And I think they would like to feel these other people are
59:54
approachable, but they’re so busy.
59:59
That’s helpful.
1:00:03
I’ve been trying to learn about that.
1:00:04
Trying to see the changes over time.
1:00:05
Well, several of the staff will kind of talk about it, and say, “Gosh, in the old
1:00:12
days it seemed like they used to actually go out in the field more with scientists,
1:00:16
and now, the staff are training the staff.” And that tends to happen, but
1:00:21
different things get lost when you have that.
1:00:25
As you mentioned before, that’s
1:00:30
a function of the growth of the program.
1:00:31
Right.
1:00:31
And a function of the scientists that they may be used to becoming more senior,
1:00:34
more scattered now, and less approachable.
1:00:38
I was curious about the LTER site in Puerto Rico, where people that came
1:00:42
in there in a very fragmented fashion.
1:00:44
Would you be more likely to have direct interaction with the scientists
1:00:51
that teach at that level, or not?
1:00:51
I think there’s a lot fewer technicians there, and because
1:00:55
scientists are coming and going so much, unless they specifically hire
1:00:58
somebody for their project, there are just a few technicians that are
1:01:02
doing some of this long-term work.
1:01:06
And in some ways, there’s probably less interaction.
1:01:09
Partly because of the language, the language barrier.
1:01:12
A lot of the technicians are Spanish-speaking, and
1:01:15
scientists, English-speakers.
1:01:17
But also, just the fact that if the scientists are only there for a week
1:01:21
every couple months, or once a year, they don’t have much time to interact.
1:01:27
And so, it seems like it’s smaller than the Andrews.
1:01:33
Some of the folks at some of these other sites that were at this hydrology meeting
1:01:38
the other day, were commenting that it’s really unusual to have a university
1:01:41
and the Forest Service collaborating
1:01:45
on an experimental forest like the Andrews, and they
1:01:48
kind of were envious of that.
1:01:51
Luquillo doesn’t really get any money from the University of Puerto Rico.
1:01:56
If anything, it’s giving money to the University of Puerto
1:01:58
Rico for different things.
1:01:59
But having some of the people employed by the university, some by the Forest
1:02:02
Service, and everybody working together, isn’t that common, as it is here.
1:02:06
I’m curious, you mentioned you’ve brought some of this
1:02:13
perspective from Hubbard Brook.
1:02:16
What were your goals in applying there?
1:02:18
Gene Likens was advertising for a post-doc.
1:02:21
Okay.
1:02:22
It was a post-doc in stream ecology.
1:02:26
I wanted to work at Hubbard Brook, and it was kind of
1:02:29
open-ended; doing some research,
1:02:35
what do you propose, and how does that fit in with our bigger goals?
1:02:40
I’d applied, and then, he interviewed two people.
1:02:43
He ended up hiring a guy who’d been working at Coweeta, but in
1:02:49
the same interim, I got back here and I’d gotten this fellowship.
1:02:55
So, here you are in
1:03:02
the Northwest.
1:03:03
Yeah.
1:03:05
I wasn’t excited about living in New York.
1:03:09
I mean that would have been a major
1:03:12
shift, you know.
1:03:13
I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to take it working in an office.
1:03:16
But the trade-off is that it would be a really good career move?
1:03:18
Right.
1:03:19
The trade-off would be working with someone like Gene Likens,
1:03:22
who is a very prominent ecologist, and working at an LTER site.
1:03:26
And it was interesting that the two post-docs, the two people that were
1:03:29
interviewed, both had LTER backgrounds.
1:03:32
So, for graduate students, I see LTER as being a really helpful way
1:03:39
to connect with a bigger scientific community than you might ordinarily
1:03:46
would by working at a regular site.
1:03:48
And when you come down to it, that’s how a lot of jobs are
1:03:51
decided; contacts and familiarity.
1:03:55
A lot of students work at this LTER site and don’t make that
1:03:59
bigger picture connection.
1:03:59
I
1:04:05
would assume in the process of going through graduate school and
1:04:07
working with LTER programs, you’ve run into other graduate students
1:04:10
who have had different experiences.
1:04:10
I was wondering how many of these people do you keep in touch with, or is
1:04:18
there like a floating community of graduate student-LTER people out
1:04:20
there, who kind of still keep in touch?
1:04:22
Uh-huh [affirmative].
1:04:23
Okay.
1:04:23
It kind of varies by project and where you end up, and how much time you
1:04:29
have.
1:04:29
I’m not sure if I might not have ended up meeting some of those people at
1:04:32
different scientific meetings anyway.
1:04:35
When you go to a scientific meeting, you see people there that you probably
1:04:37
don’t see any other time during the year, and interact and connect
1:04:40
and compare work and compare lives.
1:04:45
Between some of these meetings - the All-Scientists meetings and the
1:04:49
hydrology meetings - you get to know some of the graduate students.
1:04:54
There are quite a few
1:04:58
of the graduate students at University of Georgia, who are maybe working at
1:05:00
Coweeta, and some now work in Puerto Rico.
1:05:03
You see them and interact.
1:05:06
A graduate student in Puerto Rico sent me a manuscript for comments, because
1:05:11
he’s working on the streams there.
1:05:16
The interesting thing about science is that it’s a fairly small world.
1:05:21
I mean, it’s a big world, but you run into the same people over and
1:05:25
over again, names and interactions, and in stream ecology specifically,
1:05:32
you tend to interact a lot.
1:05:33
One of the curious things about this
1:05:39
project, is that people I interview interact so much and in different ways.
1:05:41
Oh yeah, like Hiram and Judy.
1:05:44
Judy Li is going to be teaching the stream ecology class with me, and she’s already
1:05:49
been here as a faculty member for years.
1:05:51
They’re really good friends with my major professor, and I’d run
1:05:53
into them at meetings before.
1:05:55
I’d hit them up, actually about, projects right here in Corvallis in terms of
1:05:59
graduate, or post-doctoral experience.
1:06:03
So, it becomes a fairly small world in terms of who knows who and what.
1:06:09
I probably encourage students to take advantage of the LTER aspect.
1:06:13
There is a graduate network within LTER.
1:06:23
There’s a representative from each site, kind of taking things
1:06:25
back to the bigger picture.
1:06:28
I’m not sure, because so much goes on here and everyone is already here, that
1:06:33
people take advantage of that quite as much as, say at Puerto Rico, where
1:06:37
it’s been much less of a community.
1:06:41
If people are coming and going, you kind of need more of a framework
1:06:45
for those interactions, even if it’s just through e-mail or whatever.
1:06:49
I was curious also, because you’re quite successful in post-docs here,
1:06:50
was there a difference in the kind of interactions among graduate students
1:06:51
versus post-doc situations for
1:07:05
the people that you were networking with
1:07:12
in the LTER network?
1:07:14
Graduate students are classified much more in boundaries.
1:07:16
I mean, some people don’t look at graduate students and say, “Graduate
1:07:21
students are young scientists,” especially being an older student
1:07:27
coming through the graduate process. Because I was out
1:07:30
of school for so many years,
1:07:33
I’ve been accepted a lot more as
1:07:36
a post-doc.
1:07:37
Not having to prove myself quite so much.
1:07:39
You mean accepted as a peer scientist?
1:07:42
Yeah.
1:07:42
Rather than as a graduate student, when you’re kind of expected to stand
1:07:45
in the back and not say anything more.
1:07:47
So, you’re more likely to work with other scientists
1:07:56
than grad students?
1:07:56
Even with other scientists, partly because my age group is different.
1:08:01
I’m generally older than other graduate students, so I often would still approach
1:08:07
a scientist, I treated them as a peer, rather than looking at them as the
1:08:09
professor and me as the graduate student.
1:08:13
I’d interact with people at Luquillo that way, whoever they were, whether they
1:08:18
were really senior scientists or not.
1:08:21
Partly because, once everybody got in the field, some of
1:08:26
those boundaries fall apart.
1:08:29
Here, I interact quite a bit with graduate students.
1:08:34
They kind of
1:08:37
look at me differently than I
1:08:44
look at them.
1:08:44
They look at me as a little bit more of a resource and someone who’s
1:08:46
on the other side of that process.
1:08:47
I guess I still see myself almost in some ways as a graduate
1:08:51
student, coming from the outside.
1:08:54
I came in as a post-doc, so they haven’t had that same graduate experience
1:09:02
as me.
1:09:02
I imagine that might change when you go from graduate school into
1:09:05
a post-doc?
1:09:09
With my advisor or just in general?
1:09:11
Advisor or just in general?
1:09:15
Yeah.
1:09:16
Students hit me up more as a mentor.
1:09:18
It was that way a little bit as a graduate student, just kind of as a senior graduate
1:09:23
student, but not to a great extent.
1:09:28
The students definitely hit me up and ask me questions I can’t answer.
1:09:32
[Chuckle]
1:09:33
You talked about this a little bit on
1:09:40
the phone.
1:09:40
As a graduate student, you’ve got to be moving on and finish the degree.
1:09:45
What are some of the things that post-docs go on to do?
1:09:48
If post-docs like what they’re
1:10:00
doing, sometimes they’ll take a permanent job and start up the tenure process.
1:10:08
Going
1:10:11
through that whole tenure process is not real attractive, and I’m having
1:10:14
to work so hard for the next five to seven years to get tenure at a
1:10:18
university, that’s very demanding.
1:10:20
It’s
1:10:25
supposed to be a very productive time, and I’m not sure if
1:10:28
that’s what I’m interested in.
1:10:29
I’m interested in being productive, but not jumping through more hoops, like
1:10:33
you have to go through in that process.
1:10:35
So,
1:10:39
the agency work is more attractive than tenure?
1:10:39
Sometimes, because you don’t have to go through the continuing
1:10:43
process to prove yourself.
1:10:44
You come in as a researcher, and you’re productive without having
1:10:50
to earn your stripes quite so much.
1:10:54
What’ll probably lead me to move, will be jobs.
1:10:59
I’ll get like Mark [Harmon] , and become tired of writing soft money proposals.
1:11:03
I’ve got funding for about another year-and-a-half or two years and then
1:11:05
I’ll need to come up with something.
1:11:10
I should already be writing all these proposals and starting
1:11:13
that process, because there’s a time lag in that process.
1:11:16
And I’m taking the attitude, well, I’ll get some publications out, and
1:11:20
then, when I do write proposals, I’ll be that much stronger, and my
1:11:24
record will be that much stronger.
1:11:26
But it’s a hard question, and I see some of the people like Steve [Wondzell] that
1:11:29
came through as a graduate student, now here as a post-doc here on soft money.
1:11:35
He doesn’t call himself a post-doc because of the whole phraseology of
1:11:38
being a post-doc versus being a research scientist versus being an accredited
1:11:42
scientist, or a permanent scientist.
1:11:46
So, he’s going through the whole thing of, “What am I going to do next, jobwise?”
1:11:50
and trying for lots of positions, and trying to see where he’ll end up. He’d
1:11:58
like to be selective, but yet, it kind of
1:12:04
depends on how panicked he gets.
1:12:05
I see myself probably being there in about a year, having to read and write lots of
1:12:08
proposals, get those out, and applying for jobs, and possibly moving to places
1:12:13
I really don’t want to live, if I want to do the kind of science I want to do.
1:12:19
So, there’s an interesting trade off.
1:12:21
I was curious, because the people you interact with, and probably other places
1:12:26
than here, are in a similar situation.
1:12:28
Do people consider the possibility of long-term, soft money like Bob
1:12:33
Griffiths, or some of those people that have been here for, like, 25 years?
1:12:35
Yeah.
1:12:37
Until I met Bob I hadn’t realized people did that.
1:12:40
I’d met Mark through some of the meetings, I hadn’t realized he was
1:12:42
in a totally soft money position.
1:12:45
Most people aren’t willing to consider that for very long, especially with the
1:12:50
funding these days, it’s really hard to get NSF to fund a full-fledged scientist.
1:12:56
They’ll fund graduate students, they’ll fund a post-doc.
1:13:01
So, if I write proposals and want to look for full funding for myself, I
1:13:05
need to have more senior scientists help writing it, in which case, I would be the
1:13:11
post-doc, if I want to play this game.
1:13:14
So, it’s a post-doc title, but the post-doc is still a bit
1:13:16
demeaning as a long-term title.
1:13:19
It kind of means you’re a neophyte.
1:13:23
Most people that I’ve gone through graduate school with and that are
1:13:27
in the job search market, get real discouraged about the prospects.
1:13:35
Some seem to come right up and jump into their ideal position, but more and
1:13:41
more do some pretty heavy searching, take some jobs they really aren’t
1:13:45
interested in, and then kind of keep working till they get to a point.
1:13:50
I’m not sure how willing I am to trade off living circumstances and things
1:13:54
like that for the sake of a job.
1:13:58
I’m sure that reality might affect graduate school.
1:14:03
As you mentioned earlier, the kind of general recognition
1:14:03
that there’s a lack of funding.
1:14:03
Also, it seems like recognition would be.
1:14:23
So, does that tend to draw people back perhaps to college?
1:14:25
Yeah, I think so.
1:14:25
For post-docs?
1:14:36
In some ways it’s nice to do your graduate work and make contacts for a post-doc.
1:14:42
It would have been easier for me to come up with a full-time job in Oklahoma.
1:14:46
Even though it’s better sometimes to switch places.
1:14:50
But outside your institution, you develop interactions, you develop
1:14:54
relationships, doing your research.
1:14:56
And so, it becomes hard to jump into a whole new area, unless you’re filling
1:15:02
some other person’s pre-defined need, like a post-doc, or a job application.
1:15:06
I think once you’re there, it’s a little bit easier to see projects
1:15:11
and come up with your own funding.
1:15:16
But,
1:15:18
a lot of the students that do decide to go places like here are willing
1:15:22
to do it, even though they realize they won’t be funded quite as well.
1:15:27
And you mentioned earlier, one of the reasons for that is research
1:15:30
potential already here and the
1:15:33
general, would that be “public interest” in answering research questions
1:15:37
and applied ideas, or would that
1:15:49
be just curiosity?
1:15:50
Why they choose to be where they are?
1:15:51
And why people choose a topic?
1:15:51
Why do people find research in the Northwest, for example, to be interesting?
1:15:55
I think a lot of people like the cultural environment.
1:16:03
Other people like the physical environment, meaning not only the forest,
1:16:08
but also access to the mountains, access to clean water, access to ocean, and
1:16:13
also the types of communities you’ll live in when you’re in graduate school.
1:16:17
And then, there’s the whole
1:16:22
interaction with the public.
1:16:23
In Oklahoma, no one was ever interested in what I was doing in streams.
1:16:26
People here see me down in the stream,
1:16:29
and they go, “What are you doing down there?” You know, a whole different
1:16:33
attitude of how people value their natural environment. And also, moving from Montana
1:16:42
to Oklahoma, people and friends thought I was moving to the end of the earth for
1:16:44
graduate school. “You’re going where?
1:16:44
How can you study streams in Oklahoma, there
1:16:49
aren’t any streams!” Oklahoma, actually has more miles of streams
1:16:54
than lots of places do.
1:16:56
But it is conservative, it is, you know, redneck.
1:17:01
It’s a long way to the mountains.
1:17:03
The waters in streams aren’t your pristine mountain bubbling brooks,
1:17:10
things like that.
1:17:10
And the research probably isn’t focused on the streams there?
1:17:19
No.
1:17:19
And there’s not much public land, and
1:17:23
where there’s more public land, it leads to different outcomes, as there’s all the
1:17:26
resource management going occurring on
1:17:29
the public land.
1:17:29
And I think that’s partly it’s why the West is so much different than anywhere
1:17:36
else.
1:17:36
That’s actually probably going to be my last question, because we’re almost done.
1:17:40
You
1:17:42
used the things from your class when you were talking here, contrasting applied
1:17:45
research with basic science monitoring.
1:17:47
Maybe you can zero in on that,
1:17:51
explain how you might characterize the distinctions in your own mind.
1:17:53
I see less distinction, but I came through a program that was very
1:17:58
biased towards basic research, and poo-pooed applied research.
1:18:01
At the University of Oklahoma, the Department of Zoology poo-pooed
1:18:06
anyone working on the interface of applied and basic, or anyone
1:18:10
doing purely applied research.
1:18:13
In graduate seminars, it was like, “Oh, those federal research scientists!”
1:18:17
It was almost like “selling out” in that kind of environment.
1:18:21
Academia was the only way to go.
1:18:23
But I think more and more people are realizing that you
1:18:26
can’t be isolationist anymore.
1:18:29
And I
1:18:34
feel like it’s real important to work at that interface.
1:18:40
You can’t really do applied work, if you don’t have the
1:18:41
basic theories to underlie it.
1:18:46
But I also feel it’s real important to take research and make it more
1:18:52
applicable to the general public, so they can understand these systems.
1:18:58
That’s part of why I’m interested in working with federal agencies.
1:19:01
There you can do the same thing as teaching, but do some education
1:19:05
of how these things work, and what happens if you do this to
1:19:14
this kind of a system.
1:19:14
I think it will be interesting to see.
1:19:15
I think it’ll really be changing these next few years, and the NSF is making
1:19:20
people be much more responsive to the public, and to actually put your data
1:19:26
up on the web and explain applicability.
1:19:30
For my fellowship, I was told not to work on any applied issues, and
1:19:34
I would not be given a fellowship to look at applied issues.
1:19:37
They are training basic scientists, and they’re still training for that
1:19:42
old academic mold of ivory tower-ism.
1:19:44
But, the public won’t fund a “pure” ivory tower anymore.
1:19:52
I think
1:19:55
because I’m an older student and have been through a variety of
1:19:57
other circumstances, I’m much more willing to work at that interface.
1:20:02
Or maybe have some skills to bring to that interface, is a better way to say it.
1:20:06
I think some of the young folks that come straight through are
1:20:08
willing to just do basic work.
1:20:10
I see a lot of people that come straight through in science, they really don’t
1:20:15
have some of the practical skills for communicating, for running a project,
1:20:20
for hiring people, some of those people-management skills that you need,
1:20:28
especially with the older guard in academia.
1:20:32
They can be real inept in the real world, because they’ve spent all their
1:20:35
time focusing on this ivory tower.
1:20:35
Sounds like some
1:20:41
of that political work
1:20:50
that you’re doing makes for good career building?
1:20:51
Yeah, maybe good career building, but maybe it’s what you do anyway.
1:20:55
But, that’s the way that I can contribute to these groups these days.
1:21:00
Rather than being an organizer on a different level, like I used to do,
1:21:05
I see people here being much more interactive and much less
1:21:08
of that basic/applied schism.
1:21:12
But in other places, it’s still real strong.
1:21:14
If you looked at the record of research at the Andrews, how would
1:21:23
you characterize the applied research?
1:21:26
The
1:21:31
literature I’m familiar with runs both ways.
1:21:35
Some really good basic research has come out of the Andrews, and some real
1:21:40
interesting applied work has come out.
1:21:44
So, I think, especially with people like Fred [Swanson] in leadership roles, people
1:21:49
who are very interested in seeing the “New Perspectives in Forestry” [U.S. Forest
1:21:55
Service Program in early 1990s] ideas.
1:21:57
So,
1:21:59
that really heightens the applied aspects, while still having
1:22:02
it rooted in basic science.
1:22:05
But I think a lot of the “River Continuum” concepts that came out of the Andrews,
1:22:10
or organic matter processing, and I’m not sure that’s just the Andrews,
1:22:14
because I see, having spent a meeting with these Coweeta guys, I see Coweeta
1:22:18
being similar. They’re looking at the effects of forest management practices on
1:22:24
forestry techniques, but also on streams.
1:22:27
I mean, whether it be
1:22:29
harvesting, whether it be some of these similar issues, seem to be
1:22:32
coming out of the experimental forest.
1:22:35
And then these experimental forests are often LTER sites.
1:22:38
So, the LTER aspect is a little more basic, but the experimental
1:22:42
forest is a little more applied.
1:22:43
I don’t want to rehash what you just talked about, but different
1:22:56
sites get reputations for certain tendencies or proclivities.
1:22:59
In the case of the Andrews, is that reputation more applied
1:23:05
or more basic research?
1:23:11
Well, I’m not sure I could make that distinction.
1:23:14
I don’t think it has a reputation of being in applied
1:23:19
science.
1:23:19
So, it’s probably more basic than some.
1:23:21
But it’s up there within the leading couple of sites as doing
1:23:25
very, very integrated work.
1:23:28
Would you say people at other sites see it as a program to emulate.
1:23:32
Yeah.
1:23:35
Not just on the applied front, but just in general to be
1:23:41
at, say, the stream meetings.
1:23:42
A year ago, when I was getting ready to move here and people were saying,
1:23:45
“So, what are you doing?” “Well, I’m going to go work in Oregon,
1:23:49
work at the H.J. Andrews, be based at Oregon State.” And they just
1:23:52
say, “Oh!,” and that kind of thing.
1:23:53
Good feeling?
1:23:54
Yeah.
1:23:56
Well, you don’t want people going, “Ooh-ah,” about what you do too much.
1:24:02
You don’t want to kind of rub it in their face that you have
1:24:05
this opportunity that they don’t.
1:24:07
But yet, a lot of people do really look favorably at the
1:24:11
research that goes on out here.
1:24:13
And it is hard to separate the OSU stuff from the Andrews stuff, because
1:24:18
to me, they kind of blend in together.
1:24:21
Yeah.
1:24:24
So, I imagine there are OSU folks that don’t know anything about the
1:24:26
Andrews, aren’t involved and look disparagingly on it, and kind of feel
1:24:30
like we’re a group of elitists up there.
1:24:36
Because you kind of hear that sometimes about LTER sites.
1:24:40
Have you
1:24:43
heard
1:24:48
that about the Andrews at all?
1:24:48
I hear rumblings, a little bit.
1:24:51
And I think people are careful, not to
1:24:55
be exclusive.
1:24:56
But some of the other folks that we interact with here, and Fish and
1:25:00
Wildlife don’t work at the Andrews.
1:25:03
And I think people realize that they’re welcome.
1:25:10
I think people are pretty comfortable asking.
1:25:14
But, I’ve seen that happen at other sites in terms of, “Oh yeah, this is this
1:25:21
little exclusive group up here.” But I think people up at the Andrews try
1:25:22
real hard not to be exclusive groups.
1:25:25
Part of my intention was to relate this to In a Dark Wood, which
1:25:37
gave some of the allegations that the Andrews [was a closed group]
1:25:37
. Who?
1:25:37
In a Dark Wood, the author makes allegations about the
1:25:39
Andrews as being elitist.
1:25:41
Who wrote that?
1:25:42
Alston Chase.
1:25:44
Art [McKee] was telling me about this project [Chase’s book] . He brought
1:25:48
that to my attention as a concern.
1:25:52
Yeah.
1:25:52
I think people are concerned enough that they address it.
1:25:58
Working on some of this landslide stuff and flood stuff between the College of
1:26:03
Forestry [OSU] and the Andrews, you see some tension from the engineering folks.
1:26:07
And so, I’m sure if you listen to the corners, you
1:26:13
hear it.
1:26:14
But of people within the Andrews, I’d say people tend to
1:26:20
be very inclusive.
1:26:21
They’re trying to make sure Judy Li gets involved in research up at
1:26:23
the Andrews, and pull people in, and build on skills so it happens.
1:26:31
Well, I probably should let you get back to work here.
1:26:34
This has actually been really helpful to me.
1:26:34
If anything does occur to you, let me know.
1:26:35
If on
1:26:40
some reflection of some of these issues you want to
1:26:42
develop some more, let me know.
1:26:43
It’s actually been real useful.
1:26:46
Yeah, alright.
1:26:46
I think the Andrews is a neat place.
1:26:50
And the fact that it’s coming up on its 50th [Anniversary] is pretty amazing.
1:26:54
Yeah, yeah.
