00:05
The kinds of things that might attract people to one of the national forests
00:07
could be happenstance, actually, or you could look at people who were recruited,
00:13
like Steve Eubanks, for example, or
00:21
it could be self-selection of people coming here.
00:24
I thought maybe you could talk a little bit about what brought you back
00:26
to the Willamette National Forest.
00:28
Because at that point in your career, you had a lot more choice in
00:30
where you were going to be heading.
00:32
Well, I had two choices at that point.
00:34
One was to go in the direction of the chief’s office [Washington D.C.] , or
00:45
the other one was to try to come back here, and throw my
00:49
hat in the ring for managing
00:54
one of the best forests in the country that I knew of.
00:57
I started here, and I had strong roots here.
01:04
I had counsel on both sides.
01:08
In fact, I had some folks pretty damn angry with me that I went this
01:12
direction rather than the chief’s office.
01:14
[Laughter]
01:14
Is that right?
01:14
Rather than that go that other direction.
01:18
But I felt
01:23
that’s what I wanted to do, in fact, I was flattered.
01:27
I saw the vacancy and I was talking to my wife at one point, and I said, “What
01:35
the heck, I’ll put my hat in the ring.” That afternoon, the regional forester
01:41
from [Region] called, and encouraged me to put in an application. I wasn’t
01:47
the only one that he encouraged.
01:48
Who was the regional forester then?
01:51
Dick Williams.
01:51
Okay.
01:54
So, I talked to my regional forester, Gene Hassel, and he said,
02:00
“Yeah,” he was okay with that. He said, “You know what you’re doing?
02:04
You’re
02:07
at a fork in your career, that if you go that direction, that’s probably
02:12
going to be where you end up.
02:15
Vis-a-vis, you take this other fork, and if your goal in life is to become
02:20
a regional forester or something else, that should be the direction.”
02:29
Yeah.
02:29
But I felt the Willamette tug pretty tightly there.
02:31
I’ve
02:33
never really been sorry for the choice.
02:37
You’re originally from Minnesota, right?
02:38
Yeah.
02:39
So the connection here would be that early student work, and then, your early career?
02:43
Yeah.
02:43
Right.
02:44
I fell in love with Oregon when I first came out.
02:47
I was blown over by the size of the trees and the opportunities to practice
02:53
forestry here in a pretty state.
02:56
Okay.
02:59
I never regretted leaving Minnesota, either.
03:02
I’ve got three brothers who you couldn’t pry out of there.
03:07
[Laughter]
03:08
I got some of the same reaction.
03:09
Yeah.
03:10
I go back occasionally in February, to remember why I came out here.
03:14
[Laughter]
03:14
So, that wouldn’t be too long.
03:15
Yeah.
03:18
When you were back at the University of Minnesota, going back to where you began,
03:22
were there any people in the university
03:28
shaping the way you thought about forestry or forest management?
03:31
Yeah, I really thought that Minnesota, at that point, and probably still
03:36
does, had a high professional ethic in terms of what a professional
03:44
ought to be thinking about and doing.
03:51
Guys like Bob Kaufert, who was the dean of the school at that point.
03:57
How do you spell his name?
03:58
Kaufert?
03:59
K-A-U-F-E-R-T.
04:03
Wonderful guy.
04:05
He was dean of the college [forestry]
04:10
. I think the philosophy of Minnesota then was focused on
04:24
preparing you for learning more.
04:28
The learning process didn’t stop the day you got your degree.
04:34
It was the beginning, and they tried to prepare you for that.
04:38
So, I always felt good about my education there
04:43
at Minnesota.
04:43
Some schools of forestry tend to be more trade schools.
04:48
They teach you the nuts and bolts of throwing a chain and measuring
04:53
trees, that sort of thing, but I always thought Minnesota went beyond
04:59
that, to give you the basics for understanding how forests develop
05:06
and grow, and how to live with it, how to continue to learn.
05:10
Did that have any influence, later on, in the kind of people you recruited,
05:15
whether they’d been to Minnesota?
05:18
No, I always felt good, though, if I had a Minnesotan around.
05:21
[Laughs]
05:23
It’s interesting, Dave Gibney was a Minnesotan, and I don’t know if he was
05:32
“enlightened,” the school being one piece of the picture.
05:39
Daryl Knopfs was also a Minnesotan, the current supervisor
05:47
for the Willamette.
05:48
Those guys, one preceded me and the other guy followed me, had a
05:52
whole different set of professors.
05:53
When I
05:59
was
06:03
up in Alaska working on this history of research up there, I was running across
06:06
these strains of certain schools that had more influence in who was recruited.
06:10
There were a lot of folks from the University of Michigan
06:11
and Colorado in the ‘70s.
06:11
I was just curious if
06:17
there were any particular schools that were like that over the years,
06:20
Yeah.
06:21
What were
06:27
some of the ideas that fit into what was going on here, this
06:33
cooperative thing you had going here?
06:36
Well, the only person I ever really had a chance to select was the ranger.
06:37
Really?
06:37
Yeah,
06:42
he selected his team, or her,
06:50
but I think selecting the boss is pretty important.
06:52
Yeah.
06:53
That sets the stage.
06:55
How did the level of staffing change over the time you were
06:59
working out here on this district?
07:00
On the ranger district?
07:00
Yeah.
07:05
What portion of the staff might be involved?
07:09
When I was district ranger, it was pretty much like Ed [Anderson] had
07:14
indicated, whoever happened to be
07:20
here, got the jobs.
07:21
There wasn’t anyone assigned, that pops into my mind, assigned
07:27
specifically to the Andrews.
07:28
That all came in the ‘80s.
07:34
Was that change to having someone dedicated to the Andrews, at the
07:39
initiative of the researchers there, or was that something that
07:41
came from a management standpoint, something that became necessary?
07:44
I don’t know.
07:48
I know I was involved.
07:49
Rolf [Anderson] , I’m sure, had some ideas about that.
07:52
And the district ranger, I’m sure had ideas.
07:55
I don’t know where the scientific community was coming from.
07:59
My guess is they probably supported it as well.
08:04
Okay.
08:05
You said some Oregon State University people did some forestry down there?
08:10
Hmm?
08:10
I’ve been working with the Oregon State University College of Forestry,
08:14
and there’s one thing I was noticing, going through the old records in
08:17
the files there, was the cooperative agreement worked out in the 1970s that
08:22
laid out how the Forest Service and university would administer the Andrews.
08:26
[Series of MOUs from 1961 to the present that evolved along
08:28
with HJA; IBP, LTER, etc.]
08:29
Okay.
08:29
What kind of involvement did the district and the forest [Andrews] have?
08:35
I vaguely remember being involved.
08:37
It would
08:39
be interesting to look at that.
08:42
I do remember being involved with the district ranger, and I’m almost
08:46
certain that if that was revised now, the ranger would be certainly involved.
08:53
I don’t think we revised it while I was supervisor, during the ‘80s.
09:00
There was a revision, I can’t remember the date on it, now.
09:01
I was just looking at the kind of things that were there.
09:04
I can’t remember the details.
09:10
Yeah.
09:10
Along the lines we were talking about earlier, with your time at
09:13
Minnesota, what’s your impression of the Oregon State University School
09:17
of Forestry, in relation to some of the things you were doing there?
09:25
I think they’ve come a long ways.
09:27
So, they’ve changed since the beginning of your involvement with them?
09:29
Yeah.
09:31
I think they have.
09:35
Do you have any sense why that shift took place?
09:38
Well, I don’t know.
09:38
I think the body of knowledge has just expanded, forestry
09:42
there has become more aware, and
09:51
they just got to be better informed, somehow.
09:59
It sounds like a big part of the issue, is that there’s a perception
10:02
that research as of the 1950s wasn’t addressing all the right questions
10:08
that needed to be addressed.
10:11
Am I mischaracterizing it?
10:13
Yeah,
10:18
but the sort of questions change.
10:21
Back
10:24
in the ‘50s,
10:30
I wanted more focus on the nuts and bolts of forestry, rather than broader policy.
10:37
As
10:49
we learned more about the forest, as they did in the ‘70s with the
10:54
IBP program, that whole set of questions shifted in my judgement.
11:02
More to the health of the ecosystem than the nuts and bolts, and by that time, we’d
11:09
pretty well learned how to successfully regenerate, reforest, and so on.
11:20
You mentioned they weren’t addressing the right issues in the ‘50s, but I think
11:29
they were getting geared up to do that.
11:32
The infrastructure, the calibration of watersheds,
11:38
working on the basic nutrient-cycling and those sorts of questions.
11:44
That all
11:47
helped advance the body of knowledge to the point where they could
11:52
start looking at bigger questions.
11:55
You were mentioning earlier
11:59
that when they were planning, the Forest Service began to
12:02
have an impact on that thinking.
12:04
Oh, yeah.
12:05
Who did research on that early research?
12:08
Ted Dyrness was talking about how he’d put in long-term plots, and there was a
12:14
perception of resistance from some forest managers to the idea of long-term studies.
12:18
Somewhere along the way in the 1960s and the 1970s, that shifted somehow.
12:27
There’s still a
12:31
basic
12:34
dilemma that we, managers
12:43
and researchers, face with the commitment of a piece of land
12:50
to a long-term project like
12:55
that.
12:55
Managers don’t like to be tied up in that kind of stuff forever, for good reason.
13:04
If every acre is available for some kind of activity, unless it’s taken out of
13:12
the land base, that creates problems.
13:13
The advantage of having the Andrews, there are 15,000 acres that have been designated
13:14
forever, that isn’t part of the land base
13:20
[for
13:26
calculating logging rates] , so I always strongly support any
13:29
kind of a long-term study there.
13:38
We were just negotiating for a long-term project that I was in support of on
13:45
another part of the Blue River District.
13:48
But there, you really need to have a pretty good handle on the constraints
13:54
from both sides, so you don’t screw up the research, and so that the manager doesn’t
13:59
have his or her hands tied, totally.
14:03
There’s got to be an agreement there.
14:04
So, I can see a reluctance on the part of managers to have long-term studies
14:13
imposed anywhere, just willy-nilly, wherever you’ve got a good plot put out.
14:19
You know, a logical need for that would have to be well-stated
14:27
objective for somebody to buy into.
14:31
What is your perception of
14:37
the discussion of cooperative research programs with the Andrews
14:42
and the district here, from the perspective of other experimental
14:46
forests and regional forest offices?
14:49
Well, as I stated earlier, this model
14:56
isn’t happening everywhere, not by a long ways.
15:00
In fact, it’s a rarity.
15:02
The only one that I clearly have any experience with was, I guess we had a
15:09
very little experimental forest up on the Six Rivers [National Forest] , too.
15:14
I don’t think it was a good relationship, or a strong relationship there,
15:18
anywhere near as strong as the one here.
15:21
The one that we had there was nowhere as strong as here.
15:29
I came to a conclusion, based on a very limited experience, that
15:33
this [effective and sustained collaborative dynamic] is a rare
15:36
occurrence.
15:38
So, is it your impression that, first of all, other people recognize it as
15:39
being somewhat unique, and secondly, and is that either positive or negative?
15:43
I mean, is that a good thing that it’s unique?
15:45
No, I don’t think it’s a good thing it’s unique.
15:47
It ought to be the model for how these experimental forests are operated.
15:52
It seems to me that
15:56
the partnership, particularly with a research university;
16:01
that’s icing on the cake.
16:04
That triad [WNF, PNW, OSU] , it
16:26
seems is pretty dang strong.
16:30
It sounds like what you’re saying is that the reason it doesn’t work
16:32
other places is not because they don’t want it, it’s just that for
16:37
some reason, it’s not quite jelling.
16:38
Is that what you’re saying?
16:38
Yeah.
16:41
Maybe it hasn’t tumbled out yet.
16:43
I don’t know.
16:44
[Laughing].
16:45
I guess what I’m driving at here, is there active opposition to that idea?
16:48
No.
16:48
Well, I don’t know.
16:55
Active opposition to a partnership?
16:58
It’s
17:05
something that ought not to be, seems to me.
17:08
I mean that in a round-about way.
17:09
I’m getting back to our earlier discussion about the ways that
17:11
individuals and individual relationships are what made the Andrews unique.
17:15
I think it’s the individuals.
17:19
How long can you keep that going, I don’t know?
17:21
But
17:23
the individuals have changed and it’s still going.
17:28
Once going, it’s hard to stop.
17:31
That would be my sense.
17:32
It would be awfully hard to get started other places, if that’s true?
17:36
Yeah.
17:36
Right.
17:39
One of the things we’re trying to answer in this study, actually, is to
17:41
get a handle on what it is about the Andrews that makes it work like that.
17:52
What kinds of people come looking to work in this district?
17:55
[Blue River/McKenzie] Most of the scientists told me, or suggested, that
17:59
they come to the Andrews because they’re attracted here, just by the place.
18:03
It’s just a phenomenal site.
18:05
I wonder if it isn’t just the kinds of people that are
18:06
attracted to that kind of a site?
18:09
It might be.
18:10
I could see the scientists like that, because that’s the place
18:13
where they’re going to go to work.
18:17
And I could see an individual like, say, a John Cissel, that’s been his principle
18:22
place to work on, but not entirely.
18:26
John’s been deeply involved in Augusta Creek [Landscape/Riparian study area]
18:28
, and other places on this district.
18:33
But other folks in the district, I don’t know.
18:35
In your case, it sounds like it was Oregon in general?
18:40
Yeah.
18:40
A hundred years ago.
18:43
[Laughs] A while back.
18:45
The Andrews didn’t have that reputation in those days.
18:48
In
18:56
1952, certainly it wasn’t the same relationship it is today.
19:00
I can say that with absolute certainty.
19:03
In fact, I would guess it was probably animosity.
19:06
There were turf battles of that day, I thought.
19:10
That was in the early, initial stages of development [experimental forest]
19:12
, and my guess is that there were some
19:18
struggles between people who thought, “by God, that’s mine,” and somebody
19:23
else said, “no, that’s mine,” and those senseless kinds of things.
19:25
Do you have a sense
19:31
of how your personal goals in forest management changed through your
19:35
involvement with people like Steve Eubanks and some of the people
19:40
doing research on the Andrews?
19:41
Do you think that had an impact on what your goals were?
19:47
Of course, it has.
19:49
Especially some of the things I’ve already stated;
19:55
management guides and standards that we developed here that
19:59
were heavily influenced by
20:08
what goes on at the Andrews.
20:12
My view of how the world ought to operate changed, too.
20:16
I was a supporter at one point in my career of YUM yarding.
20:20
As being a logical fact that there was an economic basis for
20:27
it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
20:28
You have the area looking better, etcetera.
20:34
We just didn’t have that key piece of information that this was kind
20:39
of a lousy way [ecologically] to do that [YUM yarding]
20:42
. I’d like to reverse that question
20:44
– – But
20:53
you know, throughout my career, I was trying to use
20:56
the best science that I could.
20:58
Yeah.
20:59
The best science that was available.
21:00
Either published or however we gained that information, and I think most
21:07
folks were trying to do the same thing.
21:09
Yeah.
21:12
I don’t want to be critical of the
21:16
people involved, that they were stupid.
21:18
Hell, they weren’t stupid.
21:19
They just didn’t have all the information needed to do that,
21:27
and that’s the way the world is.
21:29
To reverse the question, I’ve talked to a lot of scientists who are also in
21:33
the same kind of a quandary, with some who are very adamant about the need
21:39
to cooperate closely with management.
21:41
Art McKee told me many times that he doesn’t want this
21:44
to become a scientists vs.
21:46
management kind of a study.
21:48
But at some point, certain kinds of scientists are attracted to or
21:52
interested in working with managers.
21:58
Do you think that your involvement influenced the kind of scientific
22:05
inquiry that was done on
22:10
the Andrews?
22:10
Actually, what I’m getting at is the idea of a two-way flow of information.
22:13
Yeah, sure.
22:17
To me, that’s essential.
22:23
But for that to happen, you’ve gotta have people with open minds
22:25
on both sides of the spectrum.
22:30
Open to new ideas and new ways of attacking problems.
22:38
Can you give me any examples of that process at work?
22:42
One that you already mentioned is hiring Steve Eubanks, who you said had
22:46
a pretty strong impact on research.
22:52
I was just wondering if there were any other examples.
22:52
I guess that [Eubanks] was the best example I could give of how you might
23:01
have influenced this in the selection of people.
23:03
Focused on looking for people who were willing to try new things
23:08
and to be open with scientists.
23:17
Yeah, I can’t think of anything else.
23:19
One thing that
23:24
really struck me is that most scientists I’ve talked with so far, have really
23:29
stressed the concept that this is not really just the Andrews anymore, but that
23:33
it’s become kind of an extended community, where they can really focus on what
23:36
they do, and mostly outside the Andrews.
23:39
Yeah.
23:40
It reminds me a little bit
23:42
of something I ran into up in Alaska.
23:44
Many people said that research on the forest was always a
23:50
tense situation with the region up there.
23:56
I don’t know
23:59
how to respond to that.
24:01
But I think you’re right.
24:06
We had a joint meeting once with the Umpqua, and we spent
24:10
the entire day on the Andrews.
24:12
We had a regional leadership meeting on the Willamette, we hosted it, and
24:21
we spent the entire day on the Andrews.
24:25
In both cases, you could almost hear, “aha!”
24:35
I think that time, we opened up some avenues of communication, too.
24:41
When was that?
24:42
Oh dear, I can’t remember.
24:44
[Laughs]
24:47
That was about 10 years ago.
24:49
In the mid-‘80s.
24:58
You were talking earlier about how you characterized work
25:02
at the Andrews by decades.
25:03
How would you run that through, say, the 1950s?
25:07
1960s?
25:08
The
25:13
‘50s, I think, were the nuts and bolts of how you brought these
25:20
forests, these ancient forests, under some kind of management.
25:24
What was the most efficient management, roads, and harvest methods, then measuring
25:31
the effects of those on soil and water.
25:35
Seems that was the focus of the
25:40
‘50s.
25:40
Strip clear-cuts and the little clear-cuts, and they studied the effects
25:45
of wind-throw, that sort of thing.
25:48
It seems to me, that was the interest.
25:52
The interest also was big game
25:57
and fisheries,
26:01
deer, elk, and if
26:06
there was any interest in other animals, it was more from a damage
26:11
perspective, the effects of deer mice on regeneration, and so on.
26:16
It was more nuts and bolts from a science base for how are
26:20
we going to manage this land.
26:20
The ‘60s on the Andrews, I would characterize as the advent of
26:20
active demonstration projects, and the small watershed studies
26:20
that had been calibrated by then.
26:20
The initial treatment of Watersheds 1 and 3 had begun, and then, other watersheds,
26:21
Watershed 10 and several others, had
26:40
been
26:47
set
26:57
up for management, treatment or scientific manipulation.
27:05
Then, the ‘70s were devoted to the more complete study of what
27:13
was going on; the IBP days.
27:16
The ‘80s were the assimilation of all this information,
27:24
probably changing from multi-disciplinary kinds of things
27:28
to more interdisciplinary, how these disciplines could interact with one
27:35
another to provide more information and better information.
27:40
That was also the time of the completion of the site, the construction of
27:48
offices, living quarters, and having the site more accessible for teaching
27:57
or for sharing this information.
28:02
And the ‘90s, I would guess, although I haven’t been a part of it, it was more
28:06
of a center for ecosystem management, the whole focus is on ecosystem management.
28:14
All these things are inter-related.
28:16
And the teaching of that.
28:18
How do you actually do that?
28:24
Well, if you were going to look at a series of issues or ideas you’d like
28:30
this study to address, is there anything in this study that springs to your
28:36
mind from a management standpoint?
28:40
I don’t know the answer, but how did this whole thing get set up?
28:45
I don’t know the answer to that.
28:47
I know Aufderheide was involved,
28:52
but how and why this site?
28:54
Why the Andrews?
28:55
Yeah.
28:57
Why that particular location?
29:00
I think from an historical standpoint it would be interesting.
29:03
Roy Silen was telling me that Phil
29:08
Briegleb, I think it was, was talking one day, kind of casually, and mentioned that
29:11
in the 1930s, he had wandered through this site, and looked at the Andrews near
29:16
Carpenter Lookout, and he said he thought then, that if he ever wanted to have an
29:20
old-growth study site, this would be it.
29:22
He didn’t really want it then, but that’s what he said, and this would be it.
29:24
This was in the 1930s, and about the same time, you know [H.J.] Andrews
29:27
was going through on the survey.
29:30
[Congressionally-commissioned survey of forest resources in the region.]
29:30
I’ll be darned.
29:31
And so somebody, a number of people have suggested that the attraction of
29:34
the locale is what attracts people.
29:35
Yeah.
29:36
I’m not sure I entirely buy that, but at least it covers some of that.
29:40
Yeah.
29:40
Do you see any critical junctures of ideas, people,
29:46
events, and different periods?
29:48
Yeah.
29:48
I think in terms of organizing the history there ought to be
29:55
some organization scheme that
29:58
would be helpful to review.
30:03
How the science has changed over time, and what affected that change?
30:10
Is there any major bureaucratic infrastructure steps or structure of the
30:18
Forest Service, that you think might have had an effect on the emergence of the
30:22
Andrews in the 1950s through the ‘70s, or
30:25
--? I’m sure an important factor has been the various laws that drive the
30:30
nation; NEPA, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and NFMA, all
30:38
those things.
30:39
Yeah, so I think the law has probably been a good thing to
30:51
judge change from,
30:57
because of the influence they had.
30:57
As a former supervisor, you must have had quite a bit of involvement
31:00
in some of the politics between the Washington office, the region and the
31:03
forest, and some of the changes there?
31:05
To some degree.
31:06
Actually,
31:09
the politics really take place, in Washington and at the regional
31:15
level, as kind of the chief’s representative in the region.
31:23
I think there’s a lot more of that happening today in this
31:27
current administration [Clinton Admin.] , than there was in my day.
31:33
Although we hosted Congressmen and their staffs, but more
31:38
from an educational standpoint
31:46
than the drafting of legislation and all that kind of stuff that
31:49
occurs at the chief’s level.
31:51
And there’s certainly exceptions to that.
31:53
I think you mentioned earlier, but
32:05
I can’t remember you saying that you served in the Washington Office at all?
32:07
No.
32:07
So you didn’t?
32:08
No, I had a couple of details there.
32:12
My career is a little unique in that way.
32:15
I thought that was real interesting.
32:17
Because you’re probably the first person I’ve talked to at this level that didn’t.
32:20
[Laughter]
32:22
Yeah.
32:23
Even among scientists, it seems like they usually go there.
32:26
Well, I know if the chief has his way, he would like to have the folks
32:32
on the major national forests around the country, well, every forest
32:36
around the country, to go there.
32:38
I’ve heard them say that,
32:42
anyways.
32:42
This was Bill Robinson,
32:44
Okay, yeah.
32:45
But I think most chiefs feel strongly that those guys on the ground would
32:52
have a better feeling of how politics operate, if they had a tour back
33:01
there.
33:01
I wouldn’t disagree with that.
33:04
I think that’s probably correct.
33:04
Do you think that worked to your benefit, or against your interests to
33:12
not have had that experience?
33:13
I’m thinking more in terms of the institution of this forest
33:14
[Willamette NF] , actually?
33:14
No, I think, generally, I would agree with
33:21
the chief.
33:22
I had one very long detail back there, but, of course,
33:25
no one takes credit for that.
33:28
[Laughs]
33:28
What was this?
33:29
I was in RARE II,
33:33
and boy, I was there two months, maybe three.
33:37
It was interesting, exciting, and,
33:41
depending on the job, you might go back there, it was an incredible experience.
33:48
I don’t
33:52
disagree with that at all.
33:53
But it’s also expensive,
33:58
hot, humid, and.…
34:00
Most of the people I’ve talked to did say that they’d “escaped” from Washington.
34:05
Yeah.
34:05
And they always used that same word, “escaped.”
34:09
One guy comes to mind, when I was back there.
34:11
I was detailed once in the timber area, and this guy had
34:17
a monthly planning calendar, and at the end of the day, every day,
34:27
he’d put an ‘x’, like that [Laughs], you see.
34:27
Oh, dear.
34:27
He was not a happy camper.
34:29
He was counting down until he got
34:35
out of there.
34:35
And there’s always a fear that you’ll go back there and
34:36
get stuck, and never get out.
34:45
But in terms of perspective on how the system operates, have you
34:48
ever felt that you had a handicap, because you hadn’t been to D.C.?
34:52
Oh, I don’t know.
34:54
I didn’t feel that way, no.
34:59
But, I would guess that probably some have felt that
35:06
way.
35:06
[Laughs]
35:06
Other supervisors, I mean your peers?
35:06
Nobody ever told me that.
35:17
I would tell folks I’ve been there on two or three details.
35:23
Then, they’d always say, “Oh, no, no, no.” [Laughter] But
35:28
I’d go back from time-to-time, and visit the Congressmen and
35:33
whatnot, and I think that’s important too, to visit.
35:41
I shouldn’t say I was completely out of that loop.
35:44
I wasn’t.
35:46
But from a strong
35:51
place of influencing specific legislation, I don’t think I
35:57
did that.
35:57
In terms of your Congressmen, you were in California and Oregon, is that right?
36:01
And Washington, and a 5-year stint in Arizona.
36:07
So in the West?
36:08
Yeah, entirely.
36:11
Eleven western states, I
36:16
think.
36:16
Maybe this relates back to that earlier question, where I was
36:19
looking for institutional impacts on research and cooperation.
36:24
Well, I don’t want to get too deterministic about that kind of stuff,
36:26
but that seems like a pretty important
36:31
detail.
36:31
You mean, bringing around?
36:34
Well, I mean, you were a forest supervisor here at kind of a critical point [s-]
36:38
. Yeah.
36:40
And your relation to the Andrews is
36:45
kind of unique from a bureaucratic perspective.
36:46
Yeah.
36:47
And there are always, obviously, some real benefits of the kinds of solutions you
36:51
might think of when faced with problems.
36:54
Yeah, that’s right.
36:58
I don’t want to push that too far.
37:04
Actually, I’ve covered most of what I wanted to accomplish here today.
37:09
Like I said earlier, this is a preliminary interview, and likely, I’ll
37:12
be coming back to you at some point in the future with more specific issues,
37:16
and some of this is more general.
37:20
Well, the folks that you have on the list, I think, are the
37:25
ones you need to visit with.
37:28
Rolf Anderson,
37:31
I didn’t see.
37:34
Nothing pops into my mind that you would add to that list, I don’t think, other
37:39
than maybe Darrel Knopf, who would give you an up-to-date view of what’s going on.
37:44
Who’s that again?
37:44
Darrel Knopf, the current supervisor of the Willamette
37:52
[National Forest]
37:57
. Yeah, that’s really important.
37:57
And I don’t know if you have the regional perspective covered in there?
38:06
From a management standpoint.
38:07
I don’t think we do, actually.
38:08
Is there somebody you recommend I could talk to on that?
38:12
Well,
38:16
my mind is a blank.
38:18
The current planner, though in the
38:23
regional office, or whoever might be the coordinator for research,
38:32
and the principal contact, I think, would be helpful to get
38:36
that regional [Region] perspective.
38:40
Well, if anything occurs to you, you can give me a call or drop me a note.
38:45
And like I said, I’ll probably be getting back in touch with you next year.
38:48
One thing I do want to talk with you more about,
38:54
I thought we might get into that here, whether there are any memorable characters
38:57
you recall from your involvement.
39:00
I’d like to do is liven the history up with some more personalized
39:04
stories and things like that.
39:05
So, you might think about that, what we’ve been talking about today, and
39:08
if you can think of some people, or particular events, that would be helpful.
39:10
Drop me a note.
39:10
Yeah, Okay.
39:12
We can probably revisit that in a future conversation.
