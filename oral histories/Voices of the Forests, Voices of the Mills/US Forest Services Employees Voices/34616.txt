00:23
Standard format with questions, sub-questions?
00:26
Well, no standard questions.
00:27
I’m
00:35
trying to interview people from various phases of the Andrews’ history.
00:36
This is a general
00:38
interview about your
00:42
background and specific projects in the Andrews’ system.
00:46
Sometime
00:48
in the future we are going to get together down there at the Andrews
00:50
and go through some of the pictures.
00:51
Yeah, that’d be really good.
00:52
[Levno was HJA’s main photographer for decades.]
00:52
And there might be a critical time in the project when we have more specific
00:53
information needs that we can figure out
00:58
later.
01:00
I think that’s a real good idea to get together with several people talking.
01:03
That could be a really good set-up.
01:03
To get people familiar out there familiar with things from the 1960’s.
01:04
Oh, yeah!
01:10
People from
01:17
60’s and 70’s together, with those who arrived more
01:26
recently.
01:26
Uh-huh.
01:26
First impressions can have a lasting influence.
01:26
If someone goes out there now, they can see those big facilities and have
01:39
a different view than the early days.
02:07
Yeah, that’s for sure.
02:07
Let’s start out with when you started working in the Andrews in
02:07
the early 1960’s with Jack Rothacher.
02:10
Jack
02:27
Rothacher and Dick Fredriksen
02:33
were the watershed team at the time.
02:36
Tell me.
02:38
I’d thought you could
02:43
tell
03:04
me a
03:47
little
04:02
about your background before you got there.
04:04
Okay.
04:04
I came
04:14
to the Andrews in 1963 and I was just a young, green kid.
04:20
I didn’t have a college degree at the time, and came from the dry parts of
04:26
Washington state, the Palouse country.
04:29
I
04:33
worked in Eugene and picked up a job at the Andrews, which was
04:39
more in my line of training.
04:46
What as your background at this point?
04:49
It was a couple of years of forestry
04:54
at
04:56
Washington State University.
04:57
Okay.
04:57
Washington State was not an accredited university at that
04:59
time, and I was forced to
05:05
discontinue with college my sophomore year.
05:09
I came to this part of the world and found forestry jobs were plentiful
05:15
here, even without a degree.
05:18
I went up to the Blue River Ranger District, and sure enough, got
05:20
a job as a research technician for Rothacher and Fredriksen.
05:26
You moved here before you actually got a job here?
05:29
Yeah.
05:33
Kind of unheard of.
05:35
Well, kind of shuffled around in Washington and there wasn’t much forestry
05:42
or nursery work in the wintertime, so I moved to Eugene where that kind
05:48
of thing was going on regularly.
05:53
So then, you were a research technician for that period?
05:57
Yeah, I was a research technician for the watershed group, and as I started work
06:02
as a watershed tech, I learned the ropes of the gauging stations and how they
06:14
worked.
06:14
After that [early phase] , I was left on my own.
06:17
Dick Fredriksen and I were the only personnel at the Andrews, just he
06:19
and I. In ‘63 he left to finish his degree here in Corvallis, and I was
06:20
the only person at the Andrews in
06:36
those early years, the only one actually working there and living there.
06:39
‘63-‘68?
06:41
‘63-‘67, something like that.
06:50
Just a one little office in the ranger station, one little beam balance
06:53
and a drying oven, and a pick-up [truck] . Also, a big Airedale terrier.
07:00
He and I “belonged” to the Andrews at the time. For three days, we’d
07:05
check the instruments to see if everything was going alright, and
07:09
also deal with the forest at the time.
07:13
Did you live there year-round?
07:15
Yeah, I lived there year-round in the house we had.
07:17
The
07:19
research station
07:23
had the house built there.
07:25
Jack Rothacher was the first to use the house, and Dick Fredriksen was the second.
07:26
I used the trailer on the compound, the one in the back, and
07:27
I used the office in the house.
07:28
Where was the house located?
07:29
The house, I guess we still have.
07:30
Some Andrews’ person is in there now.
07:31
It is the second one
07:51
above the ranger station.
07:54
I was talking to Roy Silen about when he
08:03
was living out there during the ‘50’s.
08:05
Oh, yeah.
08:10
There are plenty of stories.
08:13
Roy
08:17
was out there.
08:18
He lived in a little old trailer and he hardly got to town, I
08:23
guess, and the visitors would come out during the weekend and
08:28
go fishing with him.
08:30
His paychecks built-up and built-up, and he never went to town.
08:35
He’d set them up on the window, and
08:44
in September he came back, and they were eaten up by mice.
08:51
[Laughter].
08:51
He’d had to get half-a-year’s paychecks reissued.
08:58
After the
09:04
tourist season, people out there would invite each other to dinner.
09:06
Do you recall anything about that when you were there?
09:06
When I was up there with
09:17
my wife and three kids, the relationship was great up there at that time.
09:28
There were a lot of community get-togethers and pot lucks.
09:34
It was a great time to be up there.
09:35
This was during the Blue River
09:41
dam construction?
09:41
That was just starting when we
09:47
first got
09:54
there.
09:54
The town was much bigger than it is now.
09:58
It had a meat market.
09:59
There were a couple of sawmills, and probably a hundred families in the area.
10:06
This was just at the completion of the Cougar [Dam] Reservoir.
10:11
There was no place to rent.
10:13
People were
10:15
looking for houses in that area.
10:18
It was a pretty close community.
10:22
Year-round residences not too much?
10:26
Yeah, two, three saw mills were operating
10:33
in Blue River at that time, and three or four stores.
10:36
A good grocery store
10:39
and a meat market.
10:39
We did all our shopping
10:43
there as opposed to now,
10:49
when we have to make a trip to town and buy our groceries.
10:51
Where’s the nearest town now, Springfield?
10:52
Springfield.
10:52
Eugene, Yeah.
10:52
Do you recall when you first got there what your first
10:56
impressions were of the place?
10:59
Well, it was completely strange to
11:07
me because I was from eastern Washington.
11:08
When I graduated from high school, there were 13 kids in my
11:10
graduating class, something like
11:24
that.
11:24
[Laughter]
11:24
I went out there on to do some research
11:33
in Lane County.
11:33
Who got you into the Andrews?
11:37
I think that was Dick Fredriksen, at the time.
11:39
That was an interesting interview that we had.
11:43
I guess Dick advertised for people in the local Eugene paper, and later
11:49
I found it was a strictly illegal undertaking for a federal job.
11:55
There were 13-14 that applied.
11:57
He took everybody out to view the Andrews.
12:03
Ultimately, he gave everybody a test
12:10
to see how they would do.
12:11
That was not Forest Service policy at
12:18
the time.
12:18
We went around to all the sites, and at that time, they were clearcutting
12:21
Watershed 1 with the skyline crane, which was a Swiss [Wyssen] company,
12:29
to 100% log this 237-acre
12:36
watershed, without [a traditional use of] roads.
12:39
They ran the skyline the length of this watershed.
12:43
With crossing-lines, it was a pretty unique experience.
12:46
They were just beginning operations when I was there.
12:53
The final stop was on the steep hill next to
13:09
the yarder.
13:12
So, it was confined to clearcutting the trees we had in Andrews?
13:15
Yeah, the
13:23
Swiss had smaller trees.
13:27
They rigged up a bigger [scale] system to get the big timber that we had.
13:34
There was the flat [on top] , and the yarder was on the hill
13:41
near the top of the hill, a real steep hill.
13:46
Dick suggested the 13-14 people go look at the yarder.
13:51
[Laughter] This was the final test of endurance:
13:57
all 13 of us started out, and I was real slow.
14:00
Some
14:04
charged up the hill.
14:07
It was a real steep climb.
14:07
Pretty soon, they all wore out and were sitting there panting.
14:10
I kept right on going, right there to the top.
14:13
Don’t know if that made a difference, if I got the job or
14:15
not, but it was sure an interesting
14:19
time.
14:21
All the people doing it together?
14:22
It was a wild deal.
14:29
You were up there with just your family and your dog?
14:31
[Once Levno started new job]
14:31
The family and dog and the whole forest.
14:33
I was the local representative
14:34
for the PNW at that time.
14:34
OSU at that time was not involved with the forest, anyway.
14:36
What did you think the role of the experimental forest was at that time?
14:36
Bob Mealey was the ranger [Blue River
14:40
R.D.] at the time,
15:02
and Bob and I
15:05
actually lived quite close to each other, and we got along pretty well.
15:11
The attitude at the ranger station at that time when Dick was there,
15:16
was not at all like it is now.
15:17
It was very different.
15:21
They were very jealous of the experimental station, and they thought
15:26
it was an extra amount of trouble.
15:29
They were actually itching to get into the experimental forest and cut those
15:35
“decadent” old-growth trees out of there.
15:39
At that time it was a restricted area, and we were doing experimental cutting.
15:48
We weren’t cutting at the rate of the district at the height of the
15:52
“glory days” during the sixties.
15:53
I think that really bothered
15:57
them.
15:58
During those years there was a very different attitude about
16:02
cooperative efforts between the station and the district.
16:06
They were really “put out” with being blessed with an experimental forest
16:12
in their midst, and did what they
16:18
could to let us know that.
16:19
Do you get any sense that attitude translated into the
16:19
people around Blue River?
16:21
Did they have an idea what that was all
16:25
about?
16:25
At that time, I don’t think that was
16:31
much of an issue.
16:32
Everyone was logging and working in the mills or on the dam [Cougar] , so the
16:38
experimental forest was, pretty much, just a hole-in-the-wall at that point.
16:45
Because it was restricted?
16:47
I’m not sure if you meant that in the sense that people couldn’t do
16:47
much about cutting, because they didn’t have much access to it?
16:51
Yeah, the forest [Willamette NF] really didn’t have much access to it.
16:54
They were depending on
16:59
the layout at that time.
17:00
My general feeling was they would love to get in there and do a lot more
17:04
cutting, rather than wait for a research proposal to do an experimental cut.
17:11
Didn’t it strike you as unusual at
17:22
that time?
17:24
From what
17:27
you had seen before?
17:27
No, at that time it was a nice place and the main emphasis
17:29
was the experimental forest.
17:34
We thought we ought to have one type of logging operation going
17:40
so we could demonstrate the different types of logging systems.
17:46
The
17:49
watershed program was just beginning to come on line.
17:54
We had three watersheds [Watersheds 1, 2 and 3] , and then, we were
17:55
thinking of instrumenting the High-15 watershed [Watersheds 6-8] , a second
17:56
set of experimental watersheds.
17:56
Did you get any sense of perceptions about
18:06
the Andrews at that time?
18:07
These were really low years,
18:16
and there wasn’t anybody there.
18:17
There was some talk about disbanding the Andrews Forest at that time.
18:19
I was going to ask about that.
18:19
I’ve heard you mention that, but I wasn’t too clear when that was?
18:21
[Disestablishment of HJA-EF was discussed by Forest Service in 1960s.]
18:22
That was in the early sixties.
18:22
It was really about, just a
18:31
really low amount of effort
18:39
there.
18:39
The researchers didn’t see it as something they should get involved in or promoting?
18:46
There
18:51
was some concern with budget cuts.
18:55
This laboratory [U.S. Forest Service Forestry Sciences Laboratory in
18:56
Corvallis] was just being built at that time, and completed the emphasis.
19:04
The idea was that people needed to be here, at the
19:08
center of interest and education and OSU.
19:13
So, people were leaving the woods and going to work in the big labs.
19:21
Maybe I was the first.
19:23
Ted mentioned there was more focus on laboratory research?
19:27
Yeah, that’s true.
19:30
This laboratory was built with dozens of wet labs.
19:36
What was your initial involvement with the people of OSU?
19:43
There was a few, like Eric Forsman.
19:48
Maybe you should talk to him about an interview.
19:50
He was really instrumental in our research when I started there in the sixties
19:54
and when we started our research on the Andrews [Forsman started his research
20:01
at the Andrews on northern spotted owls in the 1970s] . There was Jay
20:06
Gashwiler, which would be another person.
20:09
He was a small mammal biologist, and I think he was associated with OSU,
20:15
but he is pretty much on his own and working his own little program.
20:21
He had a lot of trouble getting support from the district, and there
20:27
was many a time he would come in and complain about not getting any support.
20:36
What was your role in relation to the people working out there on the forest?
20:36
To just kind of visit with them and see how they were doing, and to help them out.
20:39
Just kind of a
20:43
cooperator,
20:50
but
20:52
just someone who was also doing research on the ground.
20:58
Did they expect you to volunteer to maintain any equipment that they put in?
21:02
No.
21:05
They didn’t have much equipment at that time.
21:07
That
21:09
was in the days when
21:14
the instruments were clocks and you went around and wound them.
21:18
Someone needed to be there on
21:23
a weekly basis.
21:23
Did you get a sense of any people at that time getting
21:30
together to work on the Andrews?
21:33
No, I think that was all the IBP,
21:40
when that started.
21:41
[IBP at HJA-EF, 1970-1976]
21:41
Forsman and Gashwiler weren’t really involved with each other.
21:43
They happened to just be doing research there?
21:45
I doubt if they were really aware of each other.
21:51
I’m
21:55
curious about the impact of living year-round on a site like that with your
21:59
family.
22:02
You reported back to people in Corvallis, I assume.
22:05
Yeah, it was a very isolated situation, and I think once or twice a week we’d
22:10
get a call from Corvallis, and sit and talk about what you were doing.
22:18
You were out on your own.
22:20
There was that feeling
22:23
of just me and my dog being alone out there on the forest, walking
22:27
around, running around, and looking at the logging operations going on.
22:31
I’d
22:34
keep the instrumentation going on the watershed.
22:38
You stayed out there for a long time.
22:39
Did it ever occur you to go somewhere else?
22:41
What
22:44
were your long-range goals at
22:48
this time?
22:49
I found the work so interesting and variable, with the seasons,
22:53
that I became engrossed.
22:56
What was going on out there was a wonderful opportunity, and
23:06
I began to pick up so much from the different aspects.
23:11
It was always changing.
23:12
Whether the seasons or jobs, things were always changing.
23:18
I had a chance to leave the Andrews and be with more people here in Corvallis,
23:26
and to finish my education, finish my bachelor’s degree in computers.
23:36
That was in ’68,
23:43
I
23:48
think.
23:49
Let’s
24:09
get
24:21
to the goal.
24:23
The first thing that happened is this eastern Washington guy [Levno] got caught
24:27
out there in the Christmas floods of ’64.
24:32
Dick Fredriksen was with me, and we were taking grab samples by hand [water]
24:41
in the three watersheds [-] . That was important because they had just been
24:41
treated [clear-cut, roads built] , and it was really important to get fresh samples.
24:46
That included going out every three hours around the clock, and of course,
24:50
it’s always dark in the wintertime.
24:52
You climb out through the trees,
24:57
shine your flashlight, the trees are falling down, you get down on that
25:02
board [plank across stream in flume area] , lay down and dip your milk bottle
25:06
into the stream, and get a fresh sample.
25:07
Then go back, get three hours of sleep, and do it all again.
25:15
We were doing that in ’64, and things were getting pretty intense.
25:22
We went out to get the 1 o’clock samples on the 21st of December at 1 o’clock in
25:30
the morning, got to our watershed, it was raining, the wind was blowing, and
25:35
we were concerned about being out there.
25:36
When we got to our watershed we were even more concerned about being out there.
25:39
I looked up and there was this big fog and steam trail, and
25:45
there was this big, huge pile of debris and logs where the
25:50
crossing of the stream was.
25:52
We got really concerned and thought we ought to get the hell out of that place.
25:59
And we got back down the road, and halfway between [watersheds] 3 and 1 and another
26:04
debris slide, we came down from up there.
26:05
It [slide]
26:09
blocked us in, and this one was 10-12 feet deep with mud and rocks.
26:14
We tried to climb over it, leave the car there and walk over it, but it was too
26:19
wet and sloppy, so were kind of trapped.
26:25
So, we decided to go back to the other slide at Watershed 3,
26:29
park our car, and walk across
26:36
that slide.
26:36
We climbed on the pile, and some more debris came down.
26:38
We got across that,
26:41
and Lookout Creek was just roaring.
26:43
You could hear the big boulders just roaring throughout the night; boom, boom.
26:46
There was an old log bridge for logging purposes.
26:51
It’s gone now.
26:53
We crossed that bridge and climbed up, must have been 1,000 feet up to
26:58
the upper road on the other side.
26:59
I remember trees were coming down.
27:02
You were trying to get into an area that was a little safer?
27:03
We were trying to get back to the road.
27:07
We knew there was a road on
27:10
the other side of the Andrews.
27:16
There were several landslides in there, and I must have almost
27:20
fallen in a couple of them.
27:21
I think Dick [Fredriksen] must have grabbed me and pulled me back.
27:23
I had my glasses at that time, they were all fogged up, and I couldn’t see.
27:27
[Laughter]
27:29
I think he grabbed me by the scruff of the neck a couple of times.
27:36
This was 1 o’clock, 2 o’clock in the morning?
27:37
This was at 2, yeah.
27:37
Around 4 o’clock we head back to the McKenzie Highway, and couldn’t figure
27:41
out why no one was coming to look for us.
27:43
We found out why: the flood waters had completely overtopped the highway
27:49
and stranded others out there.
27:51
We tried to wade the flood waters to get back to the other side of the flood and
27:57
back down to Blue River and the house.
28:00
Couldn’t do it.
28:02
Dick was a big, tall, strapping guy, six-foot-six, or something
28:06
like that, I’m only barely six foot.
28:08
He was leading the way and charging down the slopes.
28:09
All of a sudden, this dog comes by, was swimming and couldn’t make it, so he
28:13
grabbed the dog by the tail, and Dick
28:18
said, “We can’t make it.” [Laughs] We came
28:21
and spent the rest of the night in a farm house there. I
28:25
can’t remember how we got home.
28:27
About 10 o’clock [a.m.] we were able to get across.
28:33
You didn’t hear any warnings that this was coming?
28:34
No.
28:35
We were out doing our jobs and we knew that
28:44
there was a storm coming, but we didn’t think it would be something like that.
28:44
That was my first real winter out there and it was quite an experience.
28:48
That was your first winter there?
28:48
That was an experience for someone from the east side to
28:51
get caught in that much rain.
28:56
I could go on for hours about snow travel in
29:03
the early years, snow machines that were coming along that we thought
29:08
we needed to get into the Andrews.
29:12
We rented out and tried to
29:22
run these contraptions, but it was a comedy of errors.
29:24
We used snow-cats and had to go to bigger machines, because our
29:27
snow is so heavy and so soft.
29:31
The little snowmobiles would have fallen right down in there.
29:37
To get to the point of when we got our first snow-cat was a
29:41
real experience.
29:41
When did you?
29:44
The director finally bought us a snow-cat, the director for the PNW Station.
29:48
It
29:53
might have been the early 70’s.
29:56
Before
30:01
then you were going by skis?
30:03
Snowshoes and skis.
30:04
We were trying different approaches, so this one year when we started our
30:09
High-15 watershed studies, we had 7-day, wind-up clocks that had to be rewound
30:16
up every seven, eight, nine days.
30:18
I
30:24
think I did five hundred miles in on snowshoes that year.
30:26
How much snow
30:30
they get up there each year?
30:32
The climate is extremely variable in the Andrews, and maybe that is good and bad.
30:40
These big events brought home the importance of research,
30:46
particularly in the watershed field.
30:48
This flood
30:52
really pointed some of
30:58
the problems [with forest management] . A big flood like this
31:00
draws more attention to [forest hydrology and disturbance events]
31:00
. What are the standards for the weather forecaster?
31:00
You worked through six or ten storms?
31:01
Yeah, we knew that there was a storm on the way, but
31:20
not a major flood.
31:20
Was there a more, in the first years, of course, was there a more
31:20
typical routine of how things had changed from season-to-season?
31:32
That
31:40
‘64 flood, was towards the front-end of a wet-snow accumulation period.
31:41
I was always there, having
31:51
lived throughout those first years, 65, 66, 67, where
31:57
we had 10, 15, 20 feet of snow on the average [in high
31:58
elevation areas] , into the
32:03
program in the ‘70s, and then, there was nothing.
32:08
Drought, as far as snow and weather.
32:14
Very sparse for a couple of years.
32:18
Then we get into the IBP period.
32:22
You came up here to Corvallis in ‘68?
32:25
Yeah.
32:26
What was your level of involvement?
32:28
With the Andrews?
32:29
Yeah.
32:30
At that time
32:40
we got involved a lot more
32:47
with the IBP program, but our program was also involved with another set
32:51
of watersheds down on the South Umpqua River [Coyote Creek, WS 1-4]
32:52
, and then, we took over watershed
33:00
studies in the Bull Run area [Fox Creek, WS, 1-3] . My job
33:00
was to keep those three areas
33:06
running.
33:06
About
33:12
every three weeks I made it down
33:16
to the Andrews.
33:16
Who did you work with when you came up there?
33:16
The same people
33:18
Okay.
33:21
There was a group of hydrologists who came up from the city of Portland.
33:24
They needed another person to service the gauges down on
33:38
the
33:40
South Umpqua with automatic recorders, and required a lot more work
33:50
from here.
33:50
The Andrews was one site for us, Ros
34:01
Mersereau replaced me at the Andrews, and that gave me the
34:03
choice of leaving or staying there.
34:06
I chose to come to Corvallis to be closer to the college.
34:07
Ros then replaced me.
34:08
I think that was in‘67 or
34:29
‘68.
34:29
Where at the college
34:41
did you work?
34:41
Forestry was not where I wanted to go in my general science
34:47
career.
34:49
I concentrated on fisheries.
34:50
Do you recall what lead you in that direction?
34:50
Well, it just what didn’t seem to fit in with what we were doing.
34:51
I thought I’d like to get involved with the water program more.
34:51
Maybe biology.
34:51
Getting caught in the flood kind of changed the career path.
34:52
Yeah, right.
34:52
So, when did you finish up here?
34:52
Oh,
35:20
it was a long haul.
35:21
It didn’t happen.
35:25
Too much
35:28
work to do.
35:28
I had been working on two night classes.
35:32
I finally took a year off and
35:43
the group paid for most of it.
35:45
We got a different experience than being there on the Andrews, to pull back
35:50
and try to get some formal education.
35:51
I’d been there so long, I got involved with the construction and maintenance of
35:55
the watersheds, which naturally carried over into building of the compound,
36:09
to maintain the whole facilities and helping that program and
36:11
being the person on the ground,
36:15
as I had been the point person on the watersheds.
36:19
[Planning and construction of campus in present site during 1970s-80s,
36:22
beginning with basic utilities and array of trailers and barns/sheds, evolved
36:22
to first-class facility in 1990s.]
36:24
You mentioned the IBP program changed the kind of people that came out there,
36:26
and their interactions with the place.
36:26
How would you perceive the interaction with the Andrews as a result?
36:28
In other words, did you see changes happening?
36:31
Yeah, it was a real radical change.
36:33
There was one or two of us on the Andrews always, then, all the
36:36
sudden 15-100 people showed up and were living in trailers and camps.
36:46
They set up camps on the Andrews.
36:48
It was really quite
37:05
interesting.
37:08
I perceived it as a good thing.
37:09
I don’t know the district’s reactions.
37:11
They had some
37:15
hard times with that, this influx of kids.
37:23
It was during the hippy days,
37:29
you could say.
37:29
If you went swimming anywhere in the Andrews, you didn’t wear clothes.
37:34
I remember at
37:36
one of our meetings Jerry said, “Well, we need to clean up our act a bit,
37:44
better not skinny-dip right out in public places.” It was a radical change.
37:51
[More traditional culture of U.S. Forest Service/Blue River Dist.,
37:51
struggled with the cultural changes.]
37:51
The community was probably going through some changes at that
37:51
time, with the logging industry?
37:51
Yeah, they were going
37:55
through
37:58
a change.
38:00
Here, university people are showing up and at all times of the night,
38:04
going out to check bats and owls and
38:10
driving state cars.
38:16
They [local citizens] were a little alarmed with what was going on.
38:20
Was there any pressure in
38:24
the form of protests to the district or anything?
38:25
No, there were just a couple of complaints to the ranger station with
38:30
people that filtered down
38:35
to us.
38:35
Who were you working with at the ranger station at that time?
38:39
It got a lot better when Bob Mealey left.
38:48
I can’t remember when Mike Kerrick came in, but that was a real change.
38:53
I think Kerrick came in around ’70.
38:58
There was that Archer fellow just before that.
39:01
At the Andrews then?
39:03
No,
39:09
but when Kerrick got there, the research people had a lot more
39:16
experience and results to connect with.
39:19
By the time Steve
39:25
Eubanks got there, and he was a major turning point.
39:35
He
39:38
went out and put some the ideas we had into practice.
39:43
I think that was a
39:46
real change in the attitudes of the Willamette National Forest.
39:50
Can you think of any staff level changes that took place here?
39:58
At the Andrews or in our operation?
40:00
At the district.
40:03
People you might have day to day contact with?
40:03
Steve Eubanks
40:08
was the biggest one.
40:09
Mike Kerrick was a big influence.
40:14
It definitely got better after the Mealey years.
40:18
Not that I had any problem.
40:20
But he sure was a gruff old fart.
40:25
Sounds like there was quite a generation gap.
40:26
Scientists coming down that were young, but you had older guys in the district?
40:32
I remember one time he [Mealey] got after Jerry Franklin.
40:35
Jerry came down and he had a little trailer up on the compound.
40:40
He’d been out, and he normally did work out in the higher elevations
40:44
in Washington or somewhere.
40:46
He didn’t shave one morning.
40:46
Bob [Mealy] saw him, and made him return
40:55
and shave his beard off.
40:59
So, he ran a real tight compound.
41:11
That
41:19
must have been a real nightmare out there, having 80-100 people doing work.
41:21
I’m thinking about the town of Blue River.
41:21
Yeah, we had a
41:26
couple
41:29
trailers on the forest, but most of people were going through Blue
41:35
River to get a soda-pop or something.
41:41
It really didn’t help out the community that much.
41:43
Was there any kind of bar where the people would hang out after work?
41:48
Yeah, but,
41:55
maybe for a little while.
41:56
It wasn’t a real good hang out spot for researchers themselves.
42:06
Sounds a lot like they were avoiding the town.
42:07
Almost to a point of avoiding the townspeople.
42:07
You mentioned there was kind of a tension because of the
42:07
younger, “hippy” research group.
42:07
Were people cautious about going into the town?
42:07
Probably were cautious.
42:07
I don’t think that there was much interaction with the town.
42:07
I think that’s starting to deteriorate [relations] from the town now.
42:11
Maybe
42:14
they resent building a big facility up
42:46
there and not using
42:55
the local facilities.
42:55
You probably mentioned earlier that they didn’t seem to realize it was there.
42:58
Yeah.
42:58
Kind of goes both ways.
42:59
If you look at the 1970s-80s period,
43:05
what would you see as
43:09
the more significant accomplishments in terms of the
43:11
kinds of projects in which you
43:13
were involved?
43:33
Well, I don’t know.
43:35
The
43:40
watershed program kind of took a hit.
43:44
We lost our leadership with
43:48
Jack Rothacher retiring, Dick Fredriksen
43:53
got sick with Alzheimer’s disease, and we were kind of short on
43:58
leaders in the hydrology program.
44:03
What time period was this?
44:05
This was when the IBP was really going strong,
44:10
and then, the switch over to the LTER program happened.
44:14
Drought situations and weather with no snow falling.
44:19
I think the watershed program, lost a lot of strength, came almost to a standstill.
44:23
In fact, we started closing down a lot
44:38
of
44:40
gauging stations.
44:41
Very little interest.
44:41
Against my supervisor’s
44:46
advice, I kept a couple of them going.
44:55
Just recently,
45:00
in
45:06
the
45:10
last four
45:15
or five years, there was an upswing in the people, Julia Jones and
45:19
Gordon Grant, who had international and national-scale interests.
45:38
They were keeping records
46:00
going
46:08
[especially South Umpqua/Coyote Creek] , and they had the support do that.
46:09
Long-term, continuous record keeping turned out to be really valuable.
46:10
This is the same period 70’s to 90?
46:11
Yeah, the 70’s were okay, and we had some IBP and LTER projects.
46:13
Kind of a maintenance program.
46:14
This was kind of a group-like program.
46:16
Yeah.
46:18
We learned all we could learn from these watersheds, and they are very expensive to
46:39
maintain.
46:39
In the watershed program, those were the declining years
46:41
of activity and maintenance.
46:44
Then, all the sudden, “boom,” it exploded, particularly after the flood
46:51
. How did your role change from the 70’s until the present?
46:57
Well, I went from the officer-in-charge of the Andrews, came up here
47:06
and gained a
47:09
lot of experience, and, to a degree, just carrying
47:17
on
47:25
the
47:28
watershed program along with Bull Run and the Andrews.
47:40
I actually kept
47:49
that watershed program kind of going in the Andrews.
47:51
You keep a boat down on the McKenzie.
47:53
Did you spend a lot of time down there?
47:54
Yeah, I love that place.
47:55
I keep a drift boat down there,
48:01
and learned how to tie flies on the river.
48:07
It’s pretty nice to take
48:12
people down and show them how to fish.
48:14
Show them the river.
48:15
I enjoyed that very much.
48:16
People come out to the Andrews frequently when they are looking
48:19
for tours and things like that, but they’ll seldom come to visit Portland.
48:21
Do you think that has worked to the benefit of studies on
48:35
the Andrews?
48:36
One thing about the Andrews that is really beneficial, is just
48:39
its location in the Cascades.
48:42
If you go down farther south in the Cascades, it’s pretty hot.
48:48
Steep hills, and then if you go north, and there’s lots of rain and
48:52
brush, but at the Andrews a lot of the conditions are just perfect.
48:57
There’s not a whole lot of brush and the stands are open and clean.
49:01
It’s a pretty enjoyable experience to wander around in the woods at the Andrews.
49:08
If we had that same experimental forest out on
49:13
the coast, we’d have all this salmonberry [laughs] or
49:16
huckleberry or devil’s club, or
49:21
up on Mount Rainer.
49:21
[Heavy undergrowth makes it harder to travel/experiment.]
49:24
Is there much involvement from the folks at Eugene?
49:27
Not Eugene particularly.
49:29
Not as much as there is with Corvallis.
49:31
But it’s just a real pleasant place to be right along the McKenzie.
49:34
The
49:36
streams are a nice size, and the big trees and the level terraces.
49:43
You don’t really have to work very hard.
49:44
In the Coast Range, you’re either straight up or straight down.
49:47
[Laughs] It’s a pretty friendly place.
49:48
What portion of your time have you spent there from 1963
49:52
to the present?
49:52
Right now I think I spend two or three days a week.
49:53
Of course, in the early years it was every day, you know.
49:53
A little bit later, every 2 or
49:58
3 weeks for awhile.
49:59
Okay, well, I’ll be getting back to you again.
50:01
I’ve got to leave for another interview now.
50:07
Yeah, sure.
50:10
Okay.
