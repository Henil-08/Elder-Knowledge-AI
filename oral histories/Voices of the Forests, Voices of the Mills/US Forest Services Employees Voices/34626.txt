00:00
This is the interview with Ross Mersereau, taking place on Wednesday, the 3rd of
00:07
September, at 1:00 in the afternoon.
00:12
Ted Dyrness also is attending the interview.
00:14
The place of the interview is Ross Mersereau’s house in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:32
If you could start out by talking a little about your personal
00:35
background and how you came to be working with the Forest Service.
00:39
I understand
00:43
that you worked as a watershed technician at the Andrews Experimental
00:46
Forest from 1966 to 1988, roughly.
00:49
Is that right?
00:52
I worked during that time, up until ‘88.
00:57
But I was already living up there, and spent all my time there until ‘70.
01:05
Okay.
01:05
And then I moved to Corvallis.
01:06
So, when did you move into the house up there?
01:09
I moved into the house up there in ‘66.
01:11
Okay.
01:12
October ‘66.
01:13
Okay.
01:14
Did you come after Dick?
01:17
[Fredriksen]
01:18
Yes.
01:19
Right after Dick?
01:19
No.
01:22
Al [Levno] was there.
01:23
Okay.
01:24
I was trying to remember if Al lived there.
01:27
And he did for a year or something.
01:28
He and his family lived in the trailer up on the hill.
01:29
When he first got there.
01:35
I remember that.
01:36
When he first got there, and I think just before when Dick [Fredriksen]
01:41
moved down [to Corvallis] to do his doctorate, then, Al moved into the house.
01:48
So, when would that be, early ‘60s?
01:53
No.
01:54
I would say
01:55
-- -- Four or something; ‘64?
01:56
Probably ’60.
01:57
Could have been ‘64 or ‘65, somewhere in there.
02:00
Yeah, something like that.
02:02
If you
02:06
could, please talk a little about what you were doing before then.
02:08
What led you to that point?
02:11
Oh, I had had some problems with my back in the kind of work that I was doing.
02:20
What had you been doing?
02:23
I worked in a cannery for a while, and then I worked driving a lumber truck.
02:30
Okay.
02:31
I was doing a lot of lifting and things, and then, I had two back
02:35
operations, and convinced the state to put me on vocational rehabilitation.
02:43
Okay.
02:44
I had a degree in education,
02:51
taught for a year, and then I decided I didn’t like that.
02:55
Where had you gone to school?
02:57
I went to Oregon State.
02:58
Oregon State.
02:59
Yeah.
02:59
You taught here in Oregon, then?
03:01
Yeah, I taught in Springfield.
03:02
Springfield, okay.
03:09
When I went to vocational rehabilitation to get some help, I thought maybe
03:14
a little different education along with what I already had, would put me
03:21
in a better position for a job that didn’t require so much back work.
03:26
Uh-huh.
03:27
So, I decided I’d rather not go back and keep trying at teaching.
03:34
I just didn’t feel like I was a teacher.
03:39
[Laughter] At least not the kind of teacher that I had hoped to be.
03:43
What level had you been teaching
03:46
at?
03:46
High school.
03:47
High school.
03:47
A particular subject?
03:50
Biology was my major.
03:53
Okay.
03:54
I had a major in biology and minors in social science and music.
04:01
And I thought that those things would be good.
04:03
Sure.
04:03
Would keep me occupied.
04:05
As far as teaching
04:09
goes?
04:09
When I went to teaching, they put me in “General Science.”
04:18
The hard part of it was that, at that particular school at that time,
04:24
they were teaching “general science” in a three-year period, and they
04:29
had general science all divided up.
04:37
General science was all physics.
04:40
Not in your bag?
04:42
[Laughter]
04:42
And I had not had any physics.
04:44
In high school and the ninth grade, I couldn’t even remember having physics,
04:48
although I know I must have had it.
04:50
Some [physics]
04:50
? You know, I had general science, and there must have been some physics.
04:55
But,
04:58
I really had to work hard.
04:59
I spent a lot of time studying, trying to keep ahead of the class.
05:04
I
05:06
was new, and didn’t have a lot of experience at the discipline, and
05:14
that really forced things for me, because I figured, if I can’t get
05:20
a hang of it, I needed to change.
05:22
I got better, but I didn’t get where I thought I was
05:26
good, and it was a real worry.
05:30
So, I decided to do something else.
05:33
I decided, if I was teaching biology where I was prepared, maybe it would
05:42
be different, but I didn’t get a job.
05:44
I tried several other schools, and all they wanted was a general science teacher.
05:51
So,
05:57
when I went to the vocational rehabilitation, I told them
05:59
I didn’t want to teach.
06:04
Would I have to just go back, and get more stuff in teaching, and
06:08
they said no, you do what you want.
06:12
So, at the time I thought I was kind of interested
06:24
in biology and the ocean.
06:26
Oceanography type stuff?
06:27
Oceanography type stuff.
06:29
So, I went out to the University of Oregon in Eugene, tried to find
06:36
somebody over there that I could talk to, and didn’t get much help.
06:44
I had gone to school with Chuck Warren, who was a Professor of Fish
06:51
and Wildlife at Oregon State, so I came back up here and I talked to him,
06:58
and he said that he would take me on.
07:01
As a graduate student?
07:06
As a graduate student.
07:06
I didn’t remember that.
07:06
Interesting.
07:06
And so,
07:10
he took me on for about a year, and then, when I finally decided
07:13
what I wanted to do for my
07:20
-- -- Thesis?
07:21
Thesis.
07:21
I switched over to one of the other professors, and started working on that.
07:28
But I was spending so much time studying and trying to get my grades
07:35
and everything, that I didn’t have enough time to really spend on the
07:43
-- -- Researching?
07:44
Research.
07:45
That sounds familiar.
07:46
[Laughter]
07:49
I got to the point where I had to make a decision.
07:52
I could either
07:55
find somebody coming in from someplace so that I could go do
07:59
it, or I would just have to lay off and go do it, and then come back.
08:08
Jay Gashwiler was one of the professors for Fish and Wildlife
08:15
[OSU Dept.] , he had a study on the Andrews, and he knew Dick Fredriksen.
08:22
Then Jack [Rothacher] , and all those guys, and he, said they need
08:29
somebody over there on the Andrews.
08:32
They’re looking for a technician to work, and it might be
08:36
something that I’d like to do.
08:38
He is the person that you did thesis with then?
08:42
No, he was the guy that
08:49
got me pointed in the right direction, and sent me to Dick.
08:54
Okay.
08:54
Did you ever finish your thesis?
08:56
No.
08:56
I never finished my thesis.
08:57
You never finished your graduate degree?
09:00
No.
09:00
I had all but about six hours of class work.
09:03
Have you had any regrets about that?
09:07
For a long time I really worried about it.
09:11
And one time Jack said to me
09:15
-- -- Don’t worry about it.
09:16
Well, he had gotten to the point in his life where what he said was,
09:25
“I’m really doing what I want to do and I just don’t want to put the
09:31
effort into more schooling.” And so he said, “I just quit trying or worrying
09:40
about getting my doctor’s degree.”
09:43
Unlike Dick.
09:46
And it was always kind of a question of whether Dick
09:48
should have done it, you know?
09:48
[Ph.D.]
09:48
Yeah, yeah.
09:50
Dick [Fredriksen] went back and got his doctorate degree, and it was
09:53
really tough, because you’re on in life
10:00
and you’re professionally established, anyway.
10:03
But this is the old idea that you need to have a Ph.D. for obtaining your “union
10:10
card” to be a bonafide research scientist.
10:13
Dick did it.
10:15
Bob Ruth did it.
10:17
And in a lot of cases it just was kind of
10:23
–- -- Not necessary.
10:24
[Unless planning career move into academia.]
10:24
Yeah, a lot of pain and misery for little return.
10:29
Yeah.
10:34
I was forty when I started the program.
10:38
You were forty?
10:39
I was not only forty, but I had all nine of my kids to support.
10:43
So,
10:45
I luckily got a job in the department over there
10:52
under work study, and I was able to make enough money plus whatever
10:58
the state gave me, plus what my disability gave from the service.
11:04
Your disability was service-connected, that’s what I was thinking.
11:07
Is it Army?
11:09
The Marine Corps.
11:09
Marine Corps.
11:09
Marine Corps, okay.
11:11
That was during World War II?
11:12
Yeah.
11:13
Okay.
11:14
That’s what I was thinking.
11:15
So, what years were you at OSU as an undergraduate after the war?
11:19
As an undergraduate, I came after the war, in 1946 to ‘51.
11:21
Okay.
11:21
I went an
11:30
extra year and went to several summer sessions.
11:36
At
11:39
that time, you had to have four years of undergraduate work
11:46
in order to get a certificate.
11:55
Then, for the next four or five years you had to keep going back to school, picking
12:01
up credits till you got 15 more credits.
12:04
Well, I just went ahead and got ‘em.
12:07
I had that much time on the G.I. Bill, and I just went ahead, and so
12:11
I took five years, came up with 200 and, oh, 50-some [credit] hours.
12:19
Then you worked for about a year, and then, you went back for the graduate work?
12:24
Right.
12:24
Had you gone into the service right after high school?
12:27
Oh, yeah.
12:28
I was 18.
12:29
What year was that?
12:29
‘42?
12:29
In ‘43.
12:33
‘43, okay.
12:34
Tail end of the war, then.
12:36
Well, ‘43 was a year after Pearl Harbor, and I was there until ‘46.
12:45
Where did you serve?
12:45
In
12:48
the South Pacific.
12:49
Yeah.
12:51
I remember you telling war stories every once in a while.
12:54
I’d forgotten that.
12:56
I remember sitting in the truck when it’s raining outside, eating our lunch…Ros
13:04
telling stories.
13:04
I went overseas as a replacement, and the Third Division had just come back from
13:13
Bougainville [Solomon Islands] . There was about six months of training in there that
13:20
I got in on, and then we went to Guam.
13:25
So,
13:28
I was in the Guam campaign and the Iwo Jima campaign.
13:34
Wow.
13:36
And that’s where I got shot.
13:38
[Laughter]
13:39
And that was a disability then?
13:41
Yeah.
13:41
[On Iwo Jima—suffered severe injuries, lungs, back, etc.]
13:42
You still get disability pay now?
13:44
Oh, yeah.
13:51
As I understand it, when you started working at the Andrews,
13:55
Jay Gashwiler was the person that put you on in this position.
13:59
Who did you work most closely with when you were actually up there at the time?
14:02
Al Levno.
14:02
Al, okay.
14:03
When I worked, Dick was always there, Jack was there, and Ted.
14:08
That was the
14:13
one thing about our unit that really attracted me, was that everybody
14:22
worked together if you needed help.
14:26
If you got on the phone and you called, it didn’t make any difference
14:31
whether it was a project leader or another technician, or wherever,
14:35
somebody came to down to give you
14:39
a hand.
14:40
Rebuilding sediment basins, stuff like that.
14:43
Might not be your study, but everybody
14:48
pitched in, especially after the ‘64 flood.
14:50
We were wiped out, and on March 3 we had to rebuild it.
14:54
It wasn’t my study, but it was expected everybody would come
14:59
out and help rebuild things.
15:04
Had you been down to the Andrews at all before you started working there?
15:09
Dick took me down the week before I moved down.
15:17
In fact, as we were driving home, coming up the road alongside
15:29
Blue River reservoir, he said, “Well, I think we’d like to have you work for us.”
15:40
[Laughter] I was pretty impressed by that time, and so I said, “Yeah.”
15:45
And I imagine an attractive part of that job was getting
15:49
housing for you and the kids?
15:51
Well, yeah.
15:54
At least I didn’t have to worry about that.
15:55
Yeah, where were you going to live and stuff.
15:56
And the fact that at that time, I had
16:01
this nice, big house, and I think it was only about forty some dollars a month.
16:08
Yeah, it’s not given to you, but it’s cheap.
16:12
At that time, I might have had to pay eighty or ninety.
16:17
I
16:22
don’t think up until the last year I was there, that I ever had to pay
16:29
more than a hundred, because, they kept re-assessing it.
16:34
And you left in ‘78.
16:36
Yeah.
16:38
Was that a Forest Service house?
16:39
It was a Forest Service house.
16:40
There in Blue River?
16:42
Right next to the ranger station.
16:43
Oh, wow.
16:43
Yep, that presented problems.
16:47
[Laughter]
16:49
Why is that?
16:50
Well, I was thinking the other day, and went through the rangers in my head,
16:57
and I only had trouble with two rangers, the guy that was there when I left, and
17:02
the guy that was there when I started.
17:07
I thought about them and how
17:12
they did after they left Blue River.
17:16
And I thought about the other two rangers that I got along well
17:19
with, and what happened to them.
17:23
It seems to me that the two guys I got along well with went the farthest.
17:28
In the Forest Service?
17:29
Yeah.
17:32
Mike Kerrick was
17:36
-- -- Supervisor.
17:36
Supervisor of the forest [Willamette NF] , by the time he retired.
17:40
And Bill [Aunsbaugh] was the Director of
17:47
Youth, or, what do you call it?
17:51
Job Corps?
17:52
Job Corps, in this
17:57
region.
17:57
The other two guys, I don’t know what happened to them.
18:00
Bob Burns?
18:01
Burns was there when I left.
18:06
Who was there when you came?
18:09
Oh
18:09
-- -- Mealey?
18:09
[Bob]
18:09
Not Mealey.
18:09
The guy after Mealey.
18:09
I’m
18:19
trying to think of his name.
18:20
Britt Ash?
18:21
No.
18:23
Well, she’s there now, Bur-something.
18:26
Lynn Burditt.
18:27
Burditt, yeah.
18:30
Came in after you left?
18:33
I don’t know.
18:33
I can’t remember who that was.
18:34
I think I’ve got it at home.
18:37
I think those two guys had
18:42
some problems with the fact that they were rangers, and I was a technician.
18:48
Tried to pull rank on you and stuff like that?
18:52
Yeah.
18:55
I didn’t let them tell me what to do because I didn’t figure
19:00
it was my job to do that.
19:01
No, because they weren’t your boss.
19:04
They weren’t the boss and if they had something that I did
19:07
that they didn’t like, and the first guy did complain to Jack.
19:14
Actually, the first guy complained to the director of the station [PNW Station]
19:18
. And he went through Jack to talk to me.
19:21
So Jack Rothacher was your
19:22
-- -- Jack was my project leader.
19:25
Okay.
19:29
Anyway, I felt if they had anything to say to me, that’s the way they should cope.
19:35
Do you remember when you first arrived at the Andrews, what your
19:38
first impressions were of the place?
19:39
Was it on that tour that you got a week
19:45
before?
19:47
I remember we stopped at the Watershed 3 gauging station.
20:10
I think Al was there.
20:15
Doing some servicing or something?
20:16
Doing a check.
20:18
Then we went up to the Hi-15 [Watersheds 6-8] , and I found out
20:24
the next week that I still didn’t know where the hell that was.
20:27
[Laughter] But, I got a chance to look at those stations and
20:36
see what I was going to do.
20:38
I didn’t see anything there that would give me any problems.
20:42
It was just a question of learning the system.
20:47
Al
20:52
taught me the system.
20:58
He spent an ungodly amount of time down there that he wouldn’t have had to do
21:04
if I’d been more knowledgeable about
21:12
everything.
21:13
He taught me how to do things I didn’t know, and pointed out big
21:19
problems you had to watch out for.
21:24
Every time I needed a hand, he was down there to help me.
21:33
If I was doing something wrong, or, if there was a problem,
21:41
he’d kind of drop me a hint.
21:43
Al’s
21:47
a very patient guy.
21:47
He really is.
21:48
Yeah.
21:50
He was living down at the McKenzie at that time, wasn’t he?
21:53
No, he was living in Corvallis at that time.
21:55
Okay.
21:56
You see, because that’s how Ros got the house.
21:58
He moved to Corvallis.
22:00
Okay.
22:01
So, he, brought you up to speed long distance.
22:04
That’s right.
22:07
I was just sitting here thinking, I wonder how many round trips Al made to Andrews.
22:12
[Laughter]
22:15
Must be astronomical; maybe tens of thousands of round-trips.
22:17
It’s no wonder that he had trouble with his marriage to his first wife.
22:24
Because
22:27
she wanted to do something besides sit at home while he was off working somewhere.
22:32
I’m sure that had a lot to do with it.
22:35
Now, you had nine kids yourself, right?
22:38
I had nine.
22:38
And did you all fit in down there alright?
22:42
Oh, yeah.
22:44
Kids liked it, didn’t they?
22:45
Yeah.
22:46
The kids really, really, did.
22:50
It took about a year for
22:55
them to get settled in.
22:55
I say
22:59
it was two or three years before I began to feel like I fit into
23:06
the “up-river community” there, and the “up-river style.” You
23:14
got so that you realized that finally you had arrived as
23:21
part of people of the river.
23:23
[“up-river” area; McKenzie River upstream from town/area of Blue River.]
23:27
Now you were there for about 12 years before you moved?
23:28
Before we moved, yeah.
23:30
So, was there some kind of event that occurred where you realized that
23:33
you were kind of comfortable there.
23:34
Do you remember when you first started feeling that?
23:37
Well,
23:41
it was that they began to talk to me like they would to anybody else on
23:50
the river.
23:51
If I walked into the Blue River Tavern, I
23:56
didn’t have to worry.
23:58
You’d walk in the door, and they’d say hello.
24:06
I got up to play shuffleboard one time, and I wasn’t very good at
24:11
it, I was just starting to learn.
24:12
One of the guys came up, one of the guys on the river and
24:18
said, “Here let me show you.”
24:23
Those kind of things.
24:26
And the people at the store start calling you by name.
24:34
You spent a lot of time in Blue River, on your time off, it sounds like.
24:38
Well, of course, I lived right there.
24:41
But, did you go in to town to buy groceries once a week like Jean
24:46
[Rothacher – wife of Jack] said they did?
24:46
Not very often.
24:47
Is that right?
24:48
Jean was saying that once a week, they would go in and buy groceries.
24:51
We did go in and buy them because it was cheaper to do that.
24:58
I
25:02
just really didn’t have enough money to make all those trips.
25:09
So, when you went, you bought in bulk?
25:11
Oh, yeah.
25:13
So, your kids mostly graduated from the local school there, it sounds like.
25:17
My oldest boy was part way through high school when we moved down there,
25:24
and he was not happy about leaving.
25:30
He left a girlfriend up
25:35
here, and he had it all figured out that he was going to move into
25:37
her house and live with her and her folks, all this kind of stuff.
25:43
I said, “No, you’re going to go with the rest of us.”
25:51
So, he wasn’t happy.
25:53
But for the rest of them, it was no problem.
25:58
After they were down there a while they got to be part of the community, too.
26:00
Maybe you
26:03
could describe an average day or average week.
26:07
What kinds of things might you have been involved in?
26:13
I think I gotta start with Friday.
26:16
Friday was the weekly check day.
26:20
That meant that
26:24
would go to each one of the watersheds, check the chart and check the heights
26:32
of the water with a hook gauge,
26:39
mark the chart
26:42
and replace it if it was time to replace the chart and take the temperature.
26:50
And also do all those things I needed to do, and make sure that the instrument
26:56
was recording, and that it was accurate.
27:02
So, I would do that at Watersheds 1, 2, and 3.
27:07
I did that at our climate station, which had rainfall and air
27:18
temperature and
27:24
moisture and what do you call it?
27:25
Humidity.
27:26
Humidity, right.
27:27
Was that that at the administrative site?
27:30
[HJA-HQ; labs, dorms, meeting rooms, etc.]
27:32
That wasn’t at the administrative site.
27:35
Where was it?
27:36
Near Watershed 2?
27:37
Yeah, it was right down the hill from Watershed 2.
27:43
That was before the administrative site’s climatic station [was constructed]
27:45
. Right, right.
27:51
What were your impressions of the facilities and the physical
27:55
infrastructure on the Andrews when you started working there?
28:03
I thought
28:08
it was set up pretty well.
28:09
The houses were made in such a way
28:17
they would go through the winter and keep things dry.
28:26
The only thing at the beginning that we really needed that we
28:31
didn’t have, was some way to
28:35
heat the [met] stations so the instruments wouldn’t freeze
28:43
up.
28:46
I thought we did pretty well.
28:48
As
28:51
time went on, I could see that we were doing pretty well in keeping the record.
28:56
Once in a while you go up, a battery would have run out and would be
29:04
stopped, and then you had to figure out what you could do to minimize
29:12
the amount of time the instrument was
29:16
down.
29:20
You got to the point where you realized
29:26
you were really there to maintain as much of the record as you could maintain.
29:32
Al
29:36
stressed that all the time to me.
29:39
You go out there, if the thing is down, you do something.
29:43
You do something to get it going, but you do something.
29:49
If that means running back to town and getting more instruments or
29:55
more batteries or whatever it takes, you get that thing going again.
30:02
A couple of times, I thought I had it going, and two or three days later,
30:09
I came back and found it was down again, and it didn’t take me long
30:13
to figure out I couldn’t trust it.
30:16
If it went down once and I didn’t do anything to really fix it, then
30:24
I couldn’t trust it to stay up.
30:28
So, I started carrying extra instruments.
30:30
If we had an extra instrument, it
30:33
went in the truck.
30:37
I always had extra batteries in the truck, and extra clocks.
30:42
Whatever I thought would take.
30:44
And there’s where Al helped because he
30:52
helped me decide what was important, and then, I just kept adding stuff
30:58
to whatever I carried in the truck so
31:03
that, if anything happened at all, I’d be able to get it started again.
31:08
Did your routine of work change with the seasons?
31:12
Beginning with winter?
31:16
The times didn’t change really.
31:19
The only thing that I had to remember was when Day Light Savings Time
31:29
came.
31:29
We ran everything on [Pacific] Standard Time, and so
31:36
whatever my watch said, I had to remember to change it by an hour.
31:40
On the chart.
31:46
We just kept doing that.
31:49
The other thing was, of course, in the winter you go out
31:57
with rain clothes and rubber boots, and whatever you can do to stay
32:02
dry, because, if you can stay dry,
32:06
you can stay warm, and if you can stay warm, you can do the work.
32:11
If you’re out there freezing, you can’t do the work the way you should.
32:18
Well, was there a problem staying dry?
32:22
Well, sometimes it would just pour.
32:26
There was a study
32:35
that had to do with
32:39
sediment in the stream.
32:50
What happens to sediment going out; does it increase or decrease,
32:56
under certain circumstances.
33:00
We had to take samples and to do it often enough that we could set up a curve.
33:10
So,
33:14
it would start raining, and you set a standard, and you
33:20
had to initiate this process.
33:24
You’d be sitting down at work, working away, finishing up,
33:29
getting ready to go home.
33:32
It would start to rain and you wouldn’t think too much about it.
33:36
An hour later, you’d realize that it’s still raining, and not only is it
33:40
raining, it’s raining harder than it was.
33:45
So, then you had to say,
33:49
is this going to be one of those times?
33:52
And you didn’t want to go out.
33:55
[Laughter] It’s not very fun to be out there when it was pouring,
34:02
but eventually you had to decide, I’ve either got to go or I’m gonna miss it.
34:12
You didn’t get too many really hard rains, but you could afford to let one go by.
34:23
Finally, it was up to me to go look and see.
34:28
I could look at the rain around me in Blue River; the Andrews
34:35
is seven or ten miles away.
34:41
I’d
34:43
look at the rain gauge outside my house, a rain gauge right outside the house.
34:53
I’d go out, I’d empty the cup and set the cup back.
34:56
The cup held a half an inch.
35:01
I would watch it and if it filled up that half inch in the next
35:06
hour or so, then I knew that
35:09
-- Pretty major percentage.
35:10
Yeah.
35:12
If it didn’t, that didn’t mean I wasn’t going out there.
35:23
If you were having problems getting enough water in the cup, you might decide
35:32
that you had to go out there and look.
35:34
And so, you would go.
35:39
And, you would know when you got out there,
35:45
how much rain was coming down, what the flow was, and what
35:53
it was recording.
35:59
By looking at the curve of the chart, you could tell what
36:04
was coming into the stream.
36:07
If you had a curve beginning to get steep and go up, then you knew that,
36:14
I need to be out taking samples.
36:16
If you got out there, and it’s still going along like nothing was happening at all,
36:22
then you probably wouldn’t worry about it.
36:25
Go home, have dinner and everything.
36:27
Maybe in the middle of the night, when you’re sound asleep, you’d get this
36:32
feeling, then, [laughter] you’d open up your eyes, and it just sounded like
36:37
the house was beginning to break down.
36:43
Then you had to go out, and it didn’t make a difference if it was 12:00
36:47
or 3:00, or whenever it was, you were expected to go out and check
36:56
on it.
36:57
Sounds like you spent a lot of time in the field alone.
36:59
You were going out by yourself it sounds like.
37:00
Oh, yeah.
37:01
Okay.
37:03
Was that ever a problem?
37:06
It was never too much of a problem.
37:09
I
37:13
personally liked people with me.
37:15
That’s why I always liked to have Al with me.
37:23
In terms of getting along out there, I could do that.
37:27
I didn’t have any trouble doing that.
37:33
What would happen if something went wrong?
37:36
Did you have a radio with you?
37:38
Well, there was
37:44
a lot of change in
37:52
that kind of thing, particularly having to do with safety.
37:55
And I know I talked with Al about it a lot of times.
38:00
On safety.
38:01
On safety, and what we need to do.
38:09
Many times, it had to do with people who were out and had gotten hurt.
38:16
One of the things was that you had
38:29
to stay in the budget.
38:31
About the only time that you could get any extra money was
38:36
at the end of the fiscal year.
38:40
Then you could make out a list and go to the powers that be, and
38:46
try to get some extra money that somebody else might have left
38:52
over.
38:52
That’s what happened to us.
38:55
We were able to
38:59
get
39:08
a big snow machine.
39:14
I would just like to take the pick-up
39:19
out there.
39:19
That allowed you not only to get out there, but allowed you to carry
39:23
everything you were supposed to carry.
39:25
By the time I left Blue River, we were getting six gallon jugs of water
39:35
that were collected all during the time, every three weeks.
39:41
And we were hauling batteries back-and-forth, instead of little
39:51
batteries just for the instruments.
39:53
These were big car batteries that we put up for the
40:00
machines that took the samples.
40:11
One of the things that we
40:15
got them to start to buy us was rain gear.
40:19
What
40:23
else?
40:24
Oh, the radios.
40:26
And all this time, we were talking about things like a
40:29
radio, so that we could call in.
40:33
Well, one of the things that happened with Al and I a couple of times, is that we
40:38
had things happen that weren’t really life threatening, except that here we were, 12,
40:49
15 miles out on the Andrews, and stuck.
40:53
With the snow machine broken down or something.
40:55
With something broken down, yeah, and with no way to call
41:00
and tell people where we were.
41:02
And I know that at least twice we met the district’s [Blue River R.D.] trucks.
41:09
Coming out from the district office.
41:10
Coming out through town.
41:11
We came into town and say we’re going by, we stopped and talked,
41:18
and my wife had gotten worried about us, so she’d called the ranger.
41:25
The district kind of acted as the backup for you out there.
41:28
Right.
41:29
So then, they would get a couple of guys and a truck, and they’d take off.
41:35
Luckily, they didn’t have to go very far because we’d manage to make it in.
41:41
Al and
41:50
I both liked being out,
41:54
but the one rule that Al had,
41:59
and that I finally incorporated into everything that I did,
42:05
was that the work comes first.
42:09
You go out, do everything you need to do to finish the job.
42:17
Then if you want to go sit out on a porch somewhere and enjoy
42:22
the scenery, you can do that.
42:26
But, if there’s any work to be done, you do that first.
42:30
If you don’t have time at the end of that time to look at the scenery,
42:32
you don’t look at the scenery.
42:32
One of those days we decided to go look at the scenery.
42:43
We had gone up to the upper Blue River, the back side
42:51
of the Andrews,
42:59
really part of
43:06
the district rather than the Andrews.
43:09
We used Lookout Creek as one watershed, the upper part of Blue River as
43:16
the other watershed, to compare.
43:19
We had gone up to upper Blue River and had made the check and everything, and it was
43:28
getting along toward the end of the day.
43:33
Al said, “Well, let’s go around Carpenter, and come down the ridge,
43:41
down Lookout Creek, that way.” Sure, that’s great. Then we’d
43:48
see what everything looks like, and what changes are being made.
43:53
So, we started down, and we got down to….[long pause]….I’m
44:09
trying to
44:12
remember
44:12
- Here, I’ve got a map.
44:21
Okay, we came around
44:32
to
44:36
here.
44:37
Right here.
44:37
Right here.
44:41
And if you remember,
44:49
there’s an old spur road that ran down into a unit and crossed the creek,
44:57
and came up on this road over here.
45:06
This had been an old stream crossing at one time.
45:12
We drove down and thought, we’ll go down there and come up on the Mack Creek road,
45:18
and then we’ll come back in that way.
45:27
Up until the ‘64-’65 period, you could drive right through there.
45:34
Anyway, we stopped, he and I got out and we looked at it, and we
45:40
decided that there wouldn’t be any problem with us if we crossed it.
45:45
So we started, and it’s not very far, it was about eight or
45:54
ten feet, I think, across
46:00
the creek
46:47
and we got clear out in the middle of it,
46:53
and
46:55
the wheel slipped off a rock, and we put the rear end right down
47:03
on a boulder.
47:05
You were hung up then.
47:05
We were hung up.
47:05
We couldn’t move.
47:06
Every time you turned the motor, the wheels would spin, and you’d sit there.
47:13
We got out and tried to figure out how to get off that boulder with
47:20
all the weight we had in the truck, and there were angles that did
47:27
not have enough push or pull or
47:31
anything.
47:31
We looked at all the stuff that we had.
47:35
Of course, I had tire chains.
47:40
We even tried hooking up a tire chain,
47:44
but it wasn’t strong enough to pull it off.
47:52
Al says, “Well, they’re logging up there.” I said, “They’re logging up the road.
47:57
We can back up where we passed them and get somebody to come down and give us a
48:07
pull.” But Al said we’d never hear the end of it.
48:09
Is that right?
48:11
You wouldn’t hear of it, huh?
48:12
[Laughter]
48:13
Al wouldn’t go ask them.
48:14
He didn’t want the district or anybody to know that we got stuck out there.
48:24
So, we started walking.
48:28
Of course, we’d just come through this unit, and
48:34
I think there was one big tree across the creek right there.
48:41
It might have been a western red cedar, or something like that.
48:52
So,
48:59
we got out, we started looking, we covered that whole unit, and we found
49:05
four or five big scraps of cable.
49:14
We wrapped it around the tree, we tied these big knots
49:21
[laughter] in the cable, and we strung them off and tied the
49:31
other ends to the front of the truck.
49:36
And then we took the old
49:44
– -- the jack.
49:45
Yeah, we had those big jacks that’s got a “come-a-long” on it.
49:51
So we tied one end on a tree there, put the other end in the
49:55
jaws, and we started to crank.
49:58
Well, it took us about half an hour to just pull the knots up
50:11
tight.
50:11
[Laughter] Finally, we got it up to where everything was tight, we did that
50:16
about three times, the thing slid right off that boulder, and we drove it right
50:26
off.
50:26
That’s a handy-man jack, right?
50:27
Handy-man, right.
50:30
So, we
50:35
came back into town, and that was when the time when the Forest Service
50:41
was starting out there to find us.
50:43
It was about 7:00 and we had started around there about
50:46
four, when we made that trip.
50:49
And we should have, we might have might have gotten home
50:54
5:30 [p.m.] at the latest.
50:59
And that’s a time when you could have used the radio and you didn’t have one.
51:04
Yeah, yeah.
51:05
You would ordinarily check-in with someone before you left, so they knew when you
51:09
were expected back, it sounds like?
51:11
Well yeah, because we had certain things we did at certain times, and we made
51:17
schedules, so that this day we would do this, and this day we would do that.
51:25
People would have an idea of about where we were going to be at any time.
51:32
And the only time that would change would be like if we did something like that,
51:38
rather than just go out and come back.
51:42
Sounds like you were lobbying for the radio for a while.
51:44
Who was the decision-maker on that?
51:46
Who did you have to convince?
51:46
I think we had to convince the project leaders for
51:53
one thing.
51:55
And we had to convince other people, the director and
52:06
his staff, that they should supply the money that it would take to
52:11
get them.
52:12
That was hard.
52:15
We never got a radio until, you remember when the technicians had
52:21
their big meeting in Portland?
52:24
All the technicians in the station [PNW] got together?
52:28
Yeah.
52:29
Oh gosh, I vaguely remember that, but I can’t remember when it was.
52:33
Well, one
52:36
of the things we stated was that we needed some kind of communication for
52:47
the field crew.
52:47
And even then, it was another four or five years before they followed through.
52:52
In Alaska, we never sent a crew out without a radio.
52:56
For example, I remember one time we had a crew on a river boat,
53:03
and they got cross-wise to a log jetting out into the stream, and,
53:12
to make a long story short, the boat sank, leaving them stranded on a river bank.
53:17
Without a radio, it would have been a bad deal.
53:19
Somebody’d have to go out and look for them, maybe that night, so we
53:24
could send help in another boat, and we never did find that boat.
53:28
[Laughter]
54:33
When was it that you did get a radio?
54:35
We got them,
54:45
I think it was after I moved to Corvallis.
54:48
No kidding?
54:48
I
54:51
think the last couple years I was in Corvallis.
54:54
We started to borrow the
55:00
pack sets and things from the district, if we were going to be
55:05
– -- Be out alone.
55:06
Be out alone.
55:08
Particularly in the winter.
55:11
It was really, really bad in the winter, if you went out.
55:19
You could go a long way with a ski-doo or a sno-cat.
55:24
And, if something happened, you were a long way
55:28
-- -- Long way from help, yeah.
55:31
We tried to, at least, in those cases, have the radio.
55:39
But on the Andrews,
55:47
there were times when things happened.
55:49
I
55:52
got stuck at Watershed
55:58
7 one time, and I had to walk back.
56:01
In the winter?
56:01
In the winter.
56:03
Well, the particular time that I did it, it was kinda in the late
56:09
spring, but there was still enough snow that I had to use a ski-doo.
56:16
And the ski-doo broken down?
56:18
The clutch
56:22
in the ski-doo is
56:26
a couple of disks that are side by side and they turn.
56:34
As you go faster, the two disks come together and put more pressure on the
56:40
belt and they cause it to go faster.
56:45
So, there are these two plates.
56:48
One of them broke.
56:51
Luckily I didn’t have my feet in there.
56:56
Usually, I ran the ski-doo on my knees.
57:00
I put my knees on the seat, then I run it that way, so I didn’t have
57:05
my feet down alongside that clutch.
57:10
It broke, and I tried whatever I could.
57:17
I knew there was no way I was gonna move that thing.
57:21
So, I
57:26
put the things that I was concerned about
57:35
keeping somebody from coming in and taking them,
57:41
in one of the gauge houses.
57:43
I think it was one of the rain-gauge houses.
57:45
And
57:53
some other stuff, I
57:58
just left it with the ski-doo.
57:59
I wasn’t too worried about that.
58:02
And then, all the data and everything like that, I put in a pack and I walked out.
58:08
How long did it take you?
58:09
Oh, it took several hours because it’s seven miles.
58:14
I checked it one time.
58:16
I had a little chart in one of my notebooks that told me how
58:20
far I was from the entrance.
58:25
It was seven miles from there to the road to Watershed 2.
58:29
That’s where you’d parked your truck?
58:35
I think at the time, I’d parked the truck, probably where McRae Creek takes
58:45
over.
58:45
So that would be a couple of miles less than that.
58:49
But slogging through snow and all, probably wet snow, if it’s
58:53
late winter or early spring.
58:55
Al and I
59:00
drove up on Blue Ridge
59:04
just past the road that goes south to Watershed 10.
59:10
That’s when the snow started to give us problems with the truck, so we got out
59:15
our snowshoes and snowshoed down to one of the units onto the road that takes
59:25
at the concrete bridge, and out and up through the Hi-15 [watersheds] , on the
59:34
backside of the ridge, took a trail, and came down the road and got to the ski-doo.
59:41
We were getting ready to see if we could get it out of there.
59:47
I had come back and looked in the book, and I’d tried to figure
59:53
out what was the part that broke.
59:55
Hmm, so he could maybe order it [the part] , and do repairs?
59:58
So we could order it, and when that part came, it wasn’t the same part.
1:00:06
So, I told Al; “There’s no point in us going out there, it’s not the right
1:00:11
part.” And he said, “Are you sure?” And I said, “I’m sure that it’s not the same
1:00:22
part.” He said, “Well, maybe they’ve had this trouble before, and this is a
1:00:29
new part that you are supposed to use.”
1:00:33
Looks different, but it’s a replacement?
1:00:33
Yeah, it’s still supposed to replace that.
1:00:36
And I said, “I don’t think it’s it,” and he said, “Well, I think
1:00:41
we ought to go check.” And so
1:00:47
I tried to
1:00:57
convince him, but he wouldn’t be convinced.
1:01:01
He was just sure.
1:01:03
You ought to go and try it at least.
1:01:05
We ought to at least try it.
1:01:07
So, like I say, rather than walk up from Watershed 2, like would have had
1:01:14
to do, we went up and drove up on top of the ridge and then went over there.
1:01:20
We got there about noon, we
1:01:28
looked at it, he looked at it, and he took the part to me.
1:01:32
We tried all kinds of things, and he finally decided that
1:01:36
it wasn’t the right part.
1:01:40
[Laughter]
1:01:40
So that you wouldn’t argue with him.
1:01:42
So, that didn’t help because we still wanted to walk out of there.
1:01:54
Al is one of these guys,
1:02:00
the only way I can describe it is,
1:02:07
if a farmer is plowing his field and something happens to the plow,
1:02:15
some way or another, he fixes it with whatever materials he has at
1:02:21
hand, so he can finish the plowing.
1:02:24
I think
1:02:29
this kind of experience in Al’s life has fixed him good for this kind of
1:02:38
thing, because he would do anything
1:02:43
to get an instrument going and keeping it going.
1:02:47
And he would do anything to
1:02:51
keep the job on an even keel.
1:02:57
If I hadn’t known part of this job, he taught it.
1:03:05
The first week I was on the job, he and I were driving around on the
1:03:12
Andrews, and it was during a lunch
1:03:16
period.
1:03:17
We had gone out, and we were doing something out there, I don’t know whether
1:03:21
it was a check or whatever it was.
1:03:24
And he said, “Well, you haven’t been up on Blue Ridge,
1:03:32
the road that goes up to the administrative site, so we’ll go up there.
1:03:40
And you can see what that’s like up there.” I was driving,
1:03:46
going up the road, and
1:03:50
there were rocks all over the road, some of them pretty good size.
1:03:58
I was trying to go around the rocks, and tried to go across one
1:04:03
of the rocks, hit a tie-rod with the rock, and broke the tie-rod.
1:04:08
And here’s these wheels destroyed on the front of the truck.
1:04:15
I thought, of all the things to do the first week
1:04:21
of the job, it’s not to do something like that.
1:04:23
It didn’t bother him, didn’t seem to bother him at all.
1:04:27
He got out, looked at it, got underneath, checked it
1:04:33
all out, and he said, “Well,” he said, “there seems to be some threads on
1:04:39
this side and some threads on that side.” And he then said, “I think we
1:04:45
can tighten that up enough so that we can get the truck back to town.”
1:04:54
In reverse drive?
1:05:00
We straightened everything up, I looked at the front, he started turning,
1:05:06
moving the wheels a little ‘till we got everything as straight as we could.
1:05:12
Wheels aren’t supposed to be that straight, but it was a pretty sloppy job.
1:05:22
We did the best we could.
1:05:25
He took the clamp off, put those two together, he turned the tie-rod and had
1:05:33
to loosen the one on the other side.
1:05:35
He turned the tie-rod so it came in more, put the clamp back on to include both
1:05:44
halves, and tightened up the other side.
1:05:48
We turned the truck around in the middle of the road and drove home.
1:05:51
[Laughter]
1:05:51
Is that right?
1:05:54
But you had the tie-rod replaced in town?
1:05:57
Yeah, we took it in to Arco, and had it fixed.
1:06:01
So how did you ever repair that snow machine?
1:06:06
Oh.
1:06:06
[Laughter]
1:06:06
Yeah,
1:06:08
I’m still out there with that old part that doesn’t work.
1:06:11
The snow machine.
1:06:13
What I was gonna say about that was,
1:06:20
Al and I looked at it a long time, and he said something about trying to
1:06:27
make something that would fit in the place of the part that was broken.
1:06:32
Clutch.
1:06:34
Yeah, and I said, “Well, let’s see now.
1:06:40
I remember before it started to snow this year, that we left a piece of
1:06:48
plywood up on the gauging station.” So, I went up, got the plywood,
1:06:57
Al and I looked at the parts.
1:07:01
We laid them down on that sheet of plywood, drew around them,
1:07:04
then took the chainsaw and cut out a round piece with a hole in
1:07:14
the middle of it, took the bolts out, put it together, put the nuts
1:07:22
back on the bolt and everything,
1:07:27
then put the belt in there and started the motor.
1:07:34
It started to turn, and it pulled the machine about eight inches maybe.
1:07:43
At which time, the belt crawled right over the top of that piece
1:07:47
of plywood because of the friction, and came down on the back side.
1:07:54
[Laughter] And we tried three or four things, you know, along the same
1:07:58
lines, trying to get that to work.
1:08:02
If we wanted to keep fixing a belt, move it six inches at a time,
1:08:07
[laughter] we probably could have got the machine down the road.
1:08:13
But, finally, it got to be about 3:00 in the afternoon, and we could see
1:08:22
that, if we didn’t start walking, we’d be out there after dark.
1:08:29
So, we had to walk all the way back to the top of the ridge and then down the
1:08:34
ridge, and finally got to the pickup.
1:08:37
That was another time we met the Forest Service coming in.
1:08:43
So, you must have been really tired that night, huh?
1:08:46
Oh,
1:08:48
boy.
1:08:49
You were out there working on quite a few stations people had set up earlier.
1:08:54
How much interaction did you have with the scientists who were using
1:08:58
the data you were bringing in?
1:08:59
Well, at the time I started, there was Ted and Jack and Dick.
1:09:12
I think those were the three.
1:09:15
I don’t remember anybody else.
1:09:18
It was almost all our project team were working there.
1:09:22
Except for guys like Franklin that’d come around every once in a while, and just
1:09:27
kind of do bootleg studies out there.
1:09:30
But at that time, it was just us
1:09:38
guys like Jay Gashwiler,
1:09:41
that came in and used the area as a study site, but it was pretty lonely out there.
1:09:47
It really was.
1:09:47
Yeah.
1:09:49
There were a lot of times when I might go out
1:09:55
off the road for maybe a quarter of a mile, half a mile, something
1:10:00
like that, and it would be just like you were on the moon or somewhere.
1:10:07
You couldn’t hear any sound of trucks.
1:10:10
Even when there were people out there, you couldn’t hear them.
1:10:20
One of the first guys that worked on the Andrews was Roy Silen.
1:10:30
Part of Roy’s study was to partition the Andrews into logging units, and
1:10:35
locate where various roads would be.
1:10:43
So, he did a lot of surveying out there and there weren’t any roads then.
1:10:48
He was out there by himself.
1:10:52
We had a few trails that he got the district to build for him.
1:11:04
When you were out there and you’d been walking for maybe a quarter of an hour,
1:11:10
a half an hour, or something like that,
1:11:14
you weren’t really sure where you were, except that you’d have an idea
1:11:18
of the direction, at least I felt like I had an idea of direction.
1:11:26
I’d say, “Boy, I don’t believe anybody’s ever been out here,
1:11:34
because I don’t see any sign of anything that
1:11:41
tell me that anybody’d been out here.” And, I’d be thinking about our own
1:11:48
studies and about the studies of those people that had been doing before us.
1:11:55
I didn’t see any possibility [that anyone had been here before] . And
1:12:00
I’d walk down and turn around a tree to go up this way, and here’s
1:12:09
one of Roy Silen’s survey signs.
1:12:13
So, he would’ve been there.
1:12:16
That’s about the only way that you realized that you
1:12:18
weren’t out there by yourself.
1:12:21
When you experienced difficulties, you were talking earlier about equipment
1:12:25
breaking down and things like, was there some kind of a process of feedback to the
1:12:31
people who designed the studies, to let them know there were problems out there?
1:12:34
How did that work?
1:12:45
When I saw there was something that
1:12:52
needed to be changed in the study, or that might affect the study,
1:13:01
I would tell Al or Jack or the scientist who was responsible for the study.
1:13:11
Then we’d decide whether we could make those kinds of changes.
1:13:15
But, if it just came to
1:13:20
that we lost three days of data because
1:13:25
a battery went down, then probably not, except when it came time to
1:13:32
work the chart, then you would see it was there, and that would be noted.
1:13:40
How much of your time up there was spent in doing that kind of data processing
1:13:43
work, once you’ve done the field work?
1:13:47
Well, that’s what I was saying about Friday.
1:13:50
On Friday, I would go out and do all these watersheds.
1:13:55
I would change the charts when needed, and
1:14:02
fix anything that needed to be fixed.
1:14:06
By the time I’d
1:14:12
been there a couple of years, I could get that all done by
1:14:16
noon or 1:00 at the latest.
1:14:19
Then I would go in, I’d sit at my desk, and I’d do all correcting on
1:14:24
the charts, and get them ready to go.
1:14:35
The times we would
1:14:42
need the charts to work them all out completely, like on the A-35 charts,
1:14:48
there might be three months before we’d take the chart off, whereas on the
1:14:55
weather charts, they would be off every
1:15:01
week or couple of weeks.
1:15:07
At those times, we would take everything together, and
1:15:13
by then, I would have worked everything over
1:15:19
we corrected for time, so that you knew when the midnight points were, and we knew
1:15:31
that this line is not
1:15:36
two inches of rain, but 1.75 inches of rain, or something like that.
1:15:43
I did most of that stuff on Friday afternoon.
1:15:50
Did your perception of your job out there and responsibilities change over time?
1:15:56
And did you get a sense your responsibilities were
1:16:00
becoming more difficult?
1:16:03
When you were out there living on the Andrews for about 12 years, in that span
1:16:10
of time, were there different kinds of studies that were being introduced there?
1:16:15
From the time
1:16:22
that I went out until
1:16:26
probably about 1970,
1:16:32
I think there was mainly just our studies.
1:16:34
And Jay Gashwiler’s.
1:16:35
Yeah, and
1:16:38
Jerry once in a while.
1:16:39
Yeah, that was when the IBP started.
1:16:42
We were one of the main areas for the coniferous biome, so there were
1:16:53
more and more people that came out.
1:16:56
One thing I noticed about that, was that where our scientists were
1:17:06
working together, the scientists in the biome, generally were not.
1:17:14
You make sure
1:17:19
one guy didn’t step on the territory of the other person.
1:17:26
That was a little harder to do
1:17:33
when some people think theirs is the only thing worth doing.
1:17:41
And they’re not a bit bashful about pushing what they do, and
1:17:48
not paying much attention to what others do.
1:17:51
I see the number of technicians increased in that period, too.
1:17:56
Is that right?
1:17:57
I
1:18:00
don’t think we had too much change in the technicians we had.
1:18:10
In the beginning, or at least in that period of time, the scientists were
1:18:15
mainly the people that came out there.
1:18:16
Oh,
1:18:22
okay.
1:18:23
So, they came out and did their own studies.
1:18:24
Yeah.
1:18:25
Plus, there were graduate students.
1:18:27
I
1:18:29
was thinking of Len Houck, for example.
1:18:33
And post-docs like Jim Sedell started coming.
1:18:35
He was a post-doc on
1:18:41
the biome.
1:18:42
The IBP project
1:18:50
in itself didn’t result in our hiring a lot more technicians.
1:18:57
We
1:19:03
hired Mike Winters,
1:19:08
mainly for Dick [Fredriksen] . Mike was supposed to help
1:19:16
on Dick’s studies so
1:19:21
Al and I could spend more time with some
1:19:27
other things.
1:19:27
We decided that we didn’t need
1:19:34
the studies expanded, but needed some extra help, particularly
1:19:43
because we were rebuilding some of our stations
1:19:48
[climate/hydrology] . Al got permission to hire a couple of new technicians, and the
1:19:54
only ones he could get were minorities.
1:19:59
And that was a real experience,
1:20:03
because
1:20:07
up until then, almost everybody we had
1:20:17
was pretty well-educated.
1:20:19
I had a degree, and Al, by this time, had a degree.
1:20:36
Under different circumstances both of us would have been scientists,
1:20:40
rather than just technicians.
1:20:46
Then we get two guys that I don’t even know if they finished high school.
1:20:53
But the thing I noticed
1:20:58
was, when I was a
1:21:04
technician,
1:21:10
most of the people in the technician-organization
1:21:15
were college-trained people.
1:21:20
And there’s
1:21:26
a different mind-set,
1:21:31
the only thing I can think of.
1:21:34
Because, in
1:21:37
all the time I was in college, I don’t think there was a year,
1:21:41
or a science course I ever took, that didn’t mention the scientific
1:21:49
aptitude….what do they call it?
1:22:12
Method?
1:22:48
Method.
1:22:48
When
1:22:52
I started working out there,
1:22:57
it was something that I had wanted to do.
1:23:04
If I’d have been smarter or thought more about it when I was
1:23:08
going to school, I would have done something besides education.
1:23:14
But,
1:23:18
it was something I really wanted to do all the time, and this
1:23:24
gave me the opportunity to do it.
1:23:27
The other thing was,
1:23:33
there were lots of times when you could look at some data that you’d gotten,
1:23:41
that you’d picked up and you screwed up somehow, or maybe went off and left
1:23:48
a bad battery on the thing, and you could have said, “Well, let’s see, we’ll
1:23:58
just run this line over here, and we’ll just forget that this ever happened.”
1:24:04
Do a little extrapolation.
1:24:05
Yeah.
1:24:08
I found that very hard to do.
1:24:16
I felt the
1:24:20
rest of the guys they used were the same way.
1:24:25
And so,
1:24:32
when you get people who don’t have that kind of education, they don’t have
1:24:39
the opportunity to understand this, and they don’t do things the same way.
1:24:48
And things aren’t as important to them.
1:24:52
It’s not important that we do this every Friday.
1:24:59
I’ll do it Friday and maybe, if I feel like it, I’ll do it Saturday, or maybe
1:25:04
I’ll come back Monday and do it, and
1:25:12
that’s okay.
1:25:14
And when you’re trying to compare Watershed 1 with Watershed 2
1:25:20
and Watershed 3, you’ve gotta do them all at the same time.
1:25:25
Because mainly, it’s easier to understand the differences when you
1:25:32
don’t have to worry about whether
1:25:38
during this rain storm, these things happened.
1:25:44
So, it sounds like
1:25:47
construction on the new stations developed over time, and different technicians were
1:25:51
brought in, not the ones you were used to working with up to that point, and
1:25:54
those new people less commonly had the college education you’re talking about.
1:25:58
Right.
1:26:00
Now, it wasn’t that
1:26:05
they weren’t good workers or anything like that.
1:26:07
It was just that it was an entirely different kind of way of looking at it.
1:26:13
To them, it was just a job like painting a house.
1:26:19
“We’ll go paint the house and maybe we’ll finish today, maybe we’ll finish
1:26:25
next week. As long as we get paid.”
1:26:31
This technician organization you were talking about, when did this start up?
1:26:36
That
1:26:44
was after ‘78, must have been in the early
1:26:53
‘80s.
1:26:53
Some of the technicians were unhappy, because
1:27:00
in their particular project,
1:27:07
they weren’t treated like they knew anything.
1:27:10
Not treated as equals.
1:27:11
See,
1:27:14
I never had that feeling.
1:27:20
I remember the first annual meeting that we had.
1:27:29
A couple weeks ahead of time, Jack [Rothacher] called me up and he said,
1:27:38
“We’re going to have a meeting, we’re gonna plan this next period of work,
1:27:43
and we want to know what’s going on.
1:27:50
If you can, prepare a short report on Watersheds 1, 2, and 3
1:27:57
when you come up.” And I came up and everybody talked about his study,
1:28:07
and nobody looked at me, like well, what the hell are you doing
1:28:10
here, or anything like that.
1:28:12
That was just part of the thing.
1:28:14
When Jack laid the work out for the coming year,
1:28:21
he also gave you certain responsibilities to do.
1:28:27
When this work that Ted and I did, came up,
1:28:35
that was one of the things that he gave me to do along with Ted.
1:28:43
No small task.
1:28:44
No.
1:28:44
Trying to get over to Watershed 1 after the slash burning.
1:28:50
About
1:28:55
1972?
1:28:55
They didn’t get around to burning that slash until ‘67, ‘68.
1:29:02
No,
1:29:04
‘66.
1:29:04
‘66? That was fall of ‘66?
1:29:05
Yeah, I was only there a week or so when that happened.
1:29:08
When they burned the slash, okay.
1:29:11
Because I could never remember.
1:29:15
Were you along with us standing on a ridge and watching it burn after night fall?
1:29:22
Yeah.
1:29:22
You told me about it.
1:29:23
I remember you guys were up on the top of the ridge, and
1:29:27
Al and I were at the bottom.
1:29:28
Oh, you
1:29:32
were at the bottom.
1:29:33
Shortly after that, that’s when we noticed that a lot of soil was piling up.
1:29:38
Yeah, well we didn’t do the soil conditions survey
1:29:40
until the following spring.
1:29:43
How much was heavily burned, lightly-burned, unburned, and so on.
1:29:46
So, it was logged from what, ‘62 to ’63?
1:29:50
Wasn’t it?
1:29:51
Yeah, they started logging it in fall of ‘62,
1:29:57
but see, the “fly in the ointment” was Watershed 1, because it was the skyline
1:30:02
method, and because the whole, huge watershed was being logged, clear-cut,
1:30:10
and the process continued over three, maybe four years.
1:30:16
Yeah, four years.
1:30:19
It threw a monkey wrench into our study, because we would envision it like the
1:30:24
settings on Watershed 3, that in a year certainly would be done, and we’d
1:30:31
set the clock back to zero as far as secondary succession following logging.
1:30:41
Ross helped me, not only on this study on soil movement, which
1:30:47
amounted to mostly dry ravel,
1:30:51
he also helped on the plant survey, the revegetation survey.
1:30:59
And the soil pits that lead down and run all over there.
1:31:05
Yeah, you guys got yoked into that too, didn’t you?
1:31:08
A lot of guys did.
1:31:09
These are the ones that never got filled back in?
1:31:12
Still there I
1:31:16
suppose [Laughter].
1:31:17
We dug about, must have been, oh, in the neighborhood of 300
1:31:23
pits on Watershed 1, 2, and 3.
1:31:23
Because it
1:31:27
was pretty intensive.
1:31:28
Now, just pick and shovel work?
1:31:32
Yeah.
1:31:35
The thing that I remember about that more than anything, was that Ted and I
1:31:41
would stand side-by-side and we would have a pit that was about that wide.
1:31:47
We could stand side-by- side with our shovels and never touch each other.
1:31:54
Dick Fredriksen and I could stand in the same position, and if I didn’t watch
1:31:59
out, I got a shovel alongside the head.
1:32:05
[Laughter] Dick was one of those guys, that when he went
1:32:07
to work, he went full-blast.
1:32:09
Yeah, there was no intermediate speed with Dick.
1:32:13
So, you helped him on Watershed 9 and 10?
1:32:16
Right.
1:32:17
Dick did most of the work on 9 and 10.
1:32:20
Of course, they came on line after Watershed 1, 2, and 3.
1:32:26
The other was the Hi-15 Watersheds [Watersheds 6-8] , then
1:32:31
9 and 10.
1:32:34
Poor Al was involved up to his ears, not only with the H.J. Andrews, but
1:32:39
we had South Umpqua, we had Fox Creek, whatever it’s called, the City of Portland
1:32:48
watershed, the Bull Run watershed.
1:32:50
You
1:32:53
mention those project meetings, especially in the spring.
1:32:59
Everybody
1:33:02
would say, “Well, we’re getting spread pretty thin on having to maintain all
1:33:07
these watersheds, all these records.” And Jack would say, “Yeah, we’re collecting
1:33:13
all these charts and we don’t even have time to digitize them and summarize
1:33:19
the data.” Remember him saying that?
1:33:22
Yeah.
1:33:22
Every year he’d say that.
1:33:24
But now that work’s all been done and everybody points to the Andrews
1:33:32
as the longest consecutive running record of climatic and stream, just
1:33:38
about anywhere in the world, and that’s worth its weight in gold.
1:33:44
And at that time we were saying,
1:33:47
it’s a human response, “Why collect all this data and put it in a drawer,
1:33:53
and never do anything with it.
1:33:55
We don’t have any time.” But, in retrospect, it was the greatest thing.
1:34:01
In retrospect, it’s good to hear guys like Ross saying, “I haven’t
1:34:08
messed up the record, and I corrected all the discrepancies on time.”
1:34:15
Because without that, the record wouldn’t be as reliable as it has been.
1:34:21
So you know, a lot of people deserve credit and we should say
1:34:30
we’re proud of it, that this information is going to be used and
1:34:35
it’s going to be valuable, and it’s got to be as accurate as possible.
1:34:40
Al deserves a heck of a lot of
1:34:44
credit, as do you, and Jack does also because he could have
1:34:52
very easily said, “As project leader, I’m going to say no more.
1:34:56
We’re going to cut out of this work.”
1:34:58
We even talked about that one time.
1:34:59
Oh, I think we talked about it every year.
1:35:02
Yeah, I remember that.
1:35:04
He was getting ready to cancel the project, or what?
1:35:08
No, not cancel the project, but just back out of all this record-keeping.
1:35:12
Oh, okay.
1:35:12
It
1:35:15
got to the point on 1, 2, and 3, where they thought, “Whoa, we’ve got enough.”
1:35:21
But
1:35:24
fortunately, about that time, Dick got interested in the chemical characteristics
1:35:29
of water, where previously most work zeroed in on suspended sediment and
1:35:37
turbidity kind in relation to conservation.
1:35:38
But then Dick got keyed into the chemical characteristics of the water, and how
1:35:44
that changed over time after logging,
1:35:48
following up on what Hubbard Brook was doing in the east.
1:35:52
And
1:35:55
so, it became increasingly important that we continue the record, because other
1:36:02
people were looking at different aspects.
1:36:04
But he needed volume changes over time, etc.
1:36:09
It
1:36:13
is interesting to know how this study, which I thought was done
1:36:19
when we wrote this article,
1:36:23
George and Fred started up again, and George ran it for
1:36:28
one more year in the ‘80s.
1:36:30
George who?
1:36:31
George Lienkaemper.
1:36:33
No kidding?
1:36:33
Yeah.
1:36:34
Is that right?
1:36:35
I didn’t know
1:36:38
that.
1:36:39
Yeah.
1:36:39
I was up in Alaska then, you know.
1:36:39
They put erosion boxes back in.
1:36:41
No kidding.
1:36:42
Where they had been, and as close as they could figure out where they were.
1:36:48
There were a couple of times I had to walk up and say, “Well, I
1:36:53
think it was about here, or there.”
1:36:56
Were they the same design boxes?
1:37:00
Yeah.
1:37:01
This design grew topsy-turvy in Jack’s garage on Woods Creek Road.
1:37:09
He said, “Well, let’s use sheets of plywood, 8 feet by 4 feet, so we have
1:37:13
the box, 8-foot long, and we’ll have
1:37:20
it supported by metal fence posts with U-bolts going into it.” Remember that?
1:37:25
Yeah.
1:37:26
Then we said, well man, a lot of the flow gets hung up short of
1:37:32
traveling clear down into the box.
1:37:35
So, that’s when we designed a sheet of plastic stretching on the slope above the
1:37:42
lip of the box to facilitate soil movement once it’s raveling down the slope, to
1:37:50
make sure it can get entirely into the
1:37:54
box.
1:37:54
Ross’ job was to go around to the various boxes and measure the amount of soil at
1:38:04
weekly intervals, or something like that.
1:38:08
Make any notes that I needed to on the amount of vegetation and all that.
1:38:11
Some of these boxes were on
1:38:18
steep slopes, very steep slopes.
1:38:22
I swear some of them were 80% plus.
1:38:25
Yeah, 80%.
1:38:26
As the focus of the studies changed and what scientists were going to do with
1:38:30
the data, did you just continue what was being done before plus new information
1:38:35
requirements, or was there a decision made at some point to discontinue some
1:38:39
elements and continue other elements?
1:38:42
Of this study?
1:38:44
Just in general.
1:38:44
This could be a good example of that.
1:38:49
Well, George and Fred set it up just like
1:38:55
they did then.
1:38:58
I didn’t think they’d have much in the boxes.
1:39:00
Were they catching much?
1:39:02
They weren’t catching much.
1:39:04
When I went out
1:39:08
on that watershed with George one time, and
1:39:16
the box that was over on the left hand side of the watershed, the one that
1:39:23
had the slump that went into the box.
1:39:28
The ceanothus was like “walking in” under these trees.
1:39:32
It was up there eight or ten feet tall, and there was nothing but bare soil.
1:39:39
And you got to walk under the ceanothus?
1:39:39
And you could walk under the ceanothus.
1:39:42
That’s healthy.
1:39:43
And then, there was berry vines and
1:39:48
what have you across the ground.
1:39:52
But, there just was so much vegetation I’m surprised that he could even get around.
1:40:00
I had trouble walking around and we didn’t have any vegetation.
1:40:05
One of the principle findings that we thought we found in this study, was that
1:40:13
it occurs principally when there’s virtually no vegetation.
1:40:17
You don’t have to have much vegetation cover to stop the cycle, because
1:40:24
it relies on cascading particles, one particle hitting another.
1:40:32
Ten, fifteen percent cover of things like fireweed would be enough
1:40:38
to really effectively hold it.
1:40:40
And, the
1:40:42
first year or two after it was burned, that’s the plant that came out the most.
1:40:50
Several species of herbs, yeah.
1:41:01
On the water samples you were talking about earlier, the shift
1:41:04
from turbidity to chemical content?
1:41:07
That was just added.
1:41:09
It was just added in?
1:41:11
Yeah.
1:41:11
One measurement may have more than the other?
1:41:13
Yes.
1:41:13
The one thing that did require, was that we make sure that there
1:41:21
was enough heat in the gauge house so the water didn’t freeze.
1:41:31
We would go up there and maybe our heaters were down.
1:41:38
Maybe they weren’t running anymore, maybe they’d run out of fuel or something.
1:41:44
Was it butane usually?
1:41:45
We usually had butane.
1:41:47
In the Hi-15, we had big 250-gallon tanks.
1:41:51
Down
1:41:54
at 9 and 10 and at 2 [Watersheds] . They finally
1:42:02
put them at 2.
1:42:02
We just had those five, ten-gallon tanks.
1:42:08
Portable ones.
1:42:09
Portable ones that we hauled.
1:42:12
That
1:42:15
mainly was a question of keeping enough heat in there so the water didn’t freeze,
1:42:25
and didn’t lock everything up in ice.
1:42:30
In
1:42:33
fact, on the Hi-15, we even put a heater under the flume, so that
1:42:40
the water coming through the flume wouldn’t freeze to the flume.
1:42:45
Those kind of things, we had to make some changes for.
1:42:52
All this stuff that
1:42:58
Al and I and Dick and whoever else who was with us came up with,
1:43:06
was by reading what somebody else did or by trying something out.
1:43:15
Talking to the gas man,
1:43:20
we finally decided that,
1:43:24
if we got regular pilot lights and set them up so that they just made
1:43:30
enough heat, if we boxed in the flume, so there was just enough
1:43:36
heat to keep it from freezing.
1:43:41
But, there were times before then that there’d be that much ice.
1:43:46
And,
1:43:48
of course, that froze the hydrograph, too.
1:43:56
Was there ever a point you reached where the things they were adding
1:43:59
into the study meant that you just didn’t have time to do it all, and
1:44:03
you needed more people to help?
1:44:08
Yeah.
1:44:09
I think that
1:44:17
most of the time, once we got a station set up and we knew just
1:44:25
exactly what we were doing with it, then what happened was that we would
1:44:31
do different sets at different times.
1:44:38
Instead of going out on Friday, for instance, and doing 1, 2, 3, and 6,
1:44:43
7, 8, 9, and 10, we’d do 1, 2, 3.
1:44:52
And then, some other time of the week, we’d do 6, 7, and 8,
1:44:56
and some other time in the week,
1:45:01
we’d do 9 and 10.
1:45:01
[Numbers refer to experimental watersheds at HJA-EF]
1:45:03
. It sounds like maybe your times that you mentioned earlier about being able
1:45:07
to sit back there and enjoy the scenery might have become a lot less common.
1:45:10
That’s true.
1:45:12
[Laughter] That’s true.
1:45:15
I never ceased to enjoy being out there though.
1:45:23
There was always something, always something.
1:45:26
And when you stopped to think about it, you’d say, well, it’s
1:45:28
just a privilege to work here.
1:45:29
It really is, you know.
1:45:30
Right.
1:45:31
Al and I many times said, “We should be paying them.” [Laughter] That’s what
1:45:37
he would say, and I would say, “Oh no,
1:45:43
oh, no.” [Laughter] But
1:45:48
we were going to the Andrews and doing that work, we were going to Bull Run
1:45:55
and doing that work, we were going to
1:46:02
Coyote Creek down on the South Umpqua, and doing the same kind of work.
1:46:09
There was always something that made the trip worthwhile.
1:46:19
When the time crunch starts to build up, was there a process where you
1:46:26
decided whether it’s necessary to hire someone else to do the work?
1:46:33
Yeah, they hired George, and he started making the trip.
1:46:40
He lived in Corvallis, but he would make the trips with Al.
1:46:46
Sometimes, we’d have to divide the work up so that we could go different places.
1:46:53
Sometimes we’d all have to go wherever it was.
1:46:57
Particularly in the summer.
1:46:59
We always used the summer to make sure everything was ready for the
1:47:08
winter, because that’s when we had all our big problems as far as
1:47:16
keeping things going.
1:47:20
We would spend a lot of time
1:47:24
preparing.
1:47:24
George and I went to Stevens Instruments up in Beaverton, and got them to give
1:47:33
us a training session [about using and maintaining their instruments]
1:47:37
. They spent one whole day teaching us how to take the instrument apart
1:47:41
and put it back together again.
1:47:43
This is George [Lienkaemper] , also?
1:47:45
Yeah.
1:47:45
Which instrument, and which company?
1:47:47
It was an A-35 Streamflow Recorder.
1:47:50
It’s
1:47:53
a big thing like that, with all kinds of
1:47:58
chains
1:48:01
and pens and what have you, and clocks.
1:48:08
They showed
1:48:10
us how the machine worked, and then they sat us down at a table and they
1:48:13
screw it up, and then they sent us down
1:48:21
there to fix it.
1:48:22
So, this was a manufacturer’s machine?
1:48:23
Yeah.
1:48:25
Blue Colt Stevens.
1:48:27
Okay.
1:48:31
They did
1:48:34
all the instruments.
1:48:35
We had the A-35, and a rain-snow gauge that worked with the same
1:48:46
kind of clocks and same kind of
1:48:51
tracking equipment.
1:48:52
Al,
1:48:56
George and I decided
1:49:00
if we were going to have to make sure those instruments were in all
1:49:04
the time, we had to know more about
1:49:08
the instruments.
1:49:08
So, we got them [Stevens] to show us.
1:49:12
We spent a whole day up there.
1:49:17
Are they manufactured up there?
1:49:18
Yeah.
1:49:20
I don’t know if they manufacture that machine anymore or not.
1:49:25
Yeah, I was wondering about that.
1:49:25
Because everything is electronic anymore.
1:49:30
But,
1:49:33
we went through their plant, and we worked with
1:49:40
all them.
1:49:40
We were looking around, and Al one day decided that instead of buying
1:49:50
some electronic equipment for streamflow gauges and everything,
1:49:55
that there were a lot of advantages to having the A-35 on every watershed.
1:50:06
Even as a back-up or something?
1:50:08
No, just having that on there.
1:50:15
For one thing, you could walk into the gauge house and look at the
1:50:21
chart, and you knew what was going on.
1:50:27
You knew what had been transpiring before you got there, and you knew
1:50:36
if it was on time, and you knew if it
1:50:40
was stopped, you had some kind of an idea of why.
1:50:49
Anyway, he felt this was better for us than going to some piece of equipment
1:50:59
that if something went wrong, we would have to ship it off to the
1:51:03
manufacturer to do something about it, and then wait for it to get back.
1:51:10
So, he collected every A-35 that he could find in the Western United
1:51:19
States, and he went clear to San Dimas [Experimental Forest in Southern
1:51:23
California] , and got A-35s from there.
1:51:25
Because other people were phasing them out?
1:51:27
Yeah.
1:51:29
And we took them and had three or four extra by the time he got done.
1:51:39
Then we started buying parts so we could fix them.
1:51:46
That’s when George and I decided we were going to have to go somewhere, like the
1:51:51
manufacturer, so they can show us how to really set the instrument up right.
1:51:58
That’s when we went,
1:52:02
not too long before I retired.
1:52:04
I called
1:52:09
USGS because they still have the A-35,
1:52:16
also.
1:52:16
I has heard they’ve got a whole warehouse full of these things somewhere.
1:52:22
That’s not true.
1:52:24
They had no intentions of getting rid of their A-35s.
1:52:30
One of them said, “I think you might be able to find some in Georgia.”
1:52:41
That speaks well for the instrument.
1:52:42
Yeah.
1:52:45
You know, in an electronic age.
1:52:47
But, anyway, I couldn’t get them from them
1:52:51
either.
1:52:51
We did a lot of work to get those instruments and in good condition.
1:52:58
So, you always, always had a couple back-ups.
1:53:00
If one falls down, you could just put a new one there.
1:53:03
Oh, yeah.
1:53:04
Lots of times we carried an instrument in and put it in place
1:53:09
of something that was already there.
1:53:12
So, the idea was just continuity of data.
1:53:13
This was one that carried all the way through.
1:53:15
Well,
1:53:22
what’s the word,
1:53:26
ratings, what’s a rating system?
1:53:29
Rating curve?
1:53:29
Yeah, for each of us.
1:53:32
Yeah, what do you call
1:53:36
peer review?
1:53:38
Anyway,
1:53:42
one of the things that [we were scored on] was “you have only lost
1:53:48
so much data over the last year.”
1:53:52
So those standards you couldn’t do anything about.
1:53:54
And we set the standards.
1:53:57
George and I set it at 95%.
1:54:02
Al said that’s not enough.
1:54:07
He wanted it about 98%, was it?
1:54:07
Well, he wanted it down to 90 or 85.
1:54:10
So, he thought he was being more realistic.
1:54:13
But George and I felt that
1:54:15
-- -- You could get 95%.
1:54:16
That we could get 95%, and if we expected ourselves to get
1:54:21
95%, that’s what we would do.
1:54:23
So, did you?
1:54:25
Pretty close.
1:54:28
I was curious, you mentioned earlier, when the IBP came in, there started
1:54:31
to be some issues with conflicting research interests out there.
1:54:37
Were people kind of stepping on each other’s toes with the research?
1:54:42
How was that resolved?
1:54:44
Okay, the IBP
1:54:49
was over in ‘74, wasn’t it?
1:54:52
No, it was still going when I left in ‘74.
1:54:55
But not much, just a couple of years.
1:54:57
Yeah, until about ‘76, ‘77.
1:54:59
Okay.
1:54:59
And then, soon after, LTER started.
1:55:02
Yeah, and
1:55:07
by the time they were done, Art McKee was taking charge of
1:55:12
things down there for Jerry.
1:55:14
As site director.
1:55:14
[HJA EF]
1:55:22
I think from then on, people began to work better.
1:55:26
Sedell was down there, and he was always a good, easy guy to work with.
1:55:34
Art McKee came in and worked with me from the time he got there.
