00:01
When they were out there, they were walking on somebody else’s toes.
00:05
That was an important thing.
00:06
Territory.
00:08
To avoid people impinging on other people’s
00:15
research sites.
00:16
You’d think that with a 15,000-acre experimental forest, it wouldn’t
00:22
be that much of a problem.
00:22
But, beginning with IBP, it became a problem.
00:22
Personal differences arose, people would
00:37
get mad, so Art’s role was very, very important.
00:41
He seemed to be the kind of guy that could do that; make everybody report
00:48
where their plots are, and keep track of what everybody was doing.
00:55
Because, like Ross said, people are really absorbed in their own little
01:00
study and they don’t have time to keep track of what the other people are doing.
01:06
That’s why you need a site director.
01:07
And one of the things that I noticed Jerry tried, was to keep everybody
01:14
talking to each other, so that everybody would know what other people were doing.
01:20
But, you take a watershed; Watershed 1 was 257 acres or
01:28
something like that.
01:29
Something like that, yeah.
01:31
With a watershed that big, you could have two or three studies going on in
01:36
it that could affect the streamflow.
01:42
You could, if you let that happen.
01:45
So, you had to watch out.
01:49
The studies that we had going on in [Watersheds] 1, 2, and 3, for
01:54
instance, were a number of studies that had to do with slope movement
01:59
and plant succession, streamflow
02:05
and sediment movement, and that kind of stuff.
02:11
But,
02:13
they all acted together and were part of the main watershed study.
02:20
So, people couldn’t move in and do things that would screw that up.
02:26
So, the difference with Art, was that there was somebody on
02:29
the site who was coordinating
02:33
that.
02:34
Who served that role when Al was there?
02:35
I did.
02:36
You did, okay.
02:38
How did that work out?
02:43
I was really Jack’s hand down there.
02:46
Representative there, yeah.
02:51
That’s the only way I could get by as a technician and do that,
02:56
if the district [Blue River R.D.] wanted to do some logging or salvage
03:01
logging, something like that.
03:04
When I first went down there, they picked up a few logs here and there for their
03:17
forestry from the Andrews.
03:22
They would do it by having salvage studies and what have you, and they
03:28
would come to me and say, “Well, we’re gonna do such and such tomorrow.
03:32
We’re sending a guy out to mark some trees for salvage on the
03:38
Hi-15 on the McRae Creek road.”
03:43
They would go out and would start marking.
03:46
I remember this particular thing happening.
03:50
One
03:52
Friday, a technician and I went up to Hi-15 [Watersheds 6, 7, & 8],
03:56
made a check, and it seemed to me
04:01
every other tree was marked,
04:05
particularly the western red cedar.
04:09
I
04:12
looked at it a long time, and a lot of
04:18
the cedars were marked.
04:19
Doing okay?
04:19
Yeah, it looked to me like it was doing alright.
04:23
So, as soon as I got back, I called Jack and told him.
04:34
One of the things that always made me feel good with Jack, was he was interested in
04:42
what I had to say, and how I would resolve
04:50
it.
04:51
I suggested he come down and we go look at
04:57
it.
04:58
So, he did, and he looked at
05:01
it and said, “Boy, I’ve seen cedar like that out there that’s fifty
05:06
years old that’s still standing.”
05:11
So, then he went and talked to the district.
05:17
When he went back to Corvallis, he wrote some rules for salvage logging.
05:21
And
05:24
wrote them in a letter with these rules in
05:28
it.
05:29
When I went back out there, a lot of those marks were marked out.
05:35
Painted over.
05:36
Yeah.
05:39
So, that was the kind of thing I did.
05:43
When people had a complaint because of something that happened on their
05:50
study, they’d say something to me, then I’d go look at it and talk to
05:57
whoever I thought I needed to talk to.
06:00
I never had any problems.
06:12
I was saying about the rangers; whoever the ranger was
06:16
there made a big difference.
06:21
I
06:25
wish I could remember his name, the first guy there.
06:32
He was not for doing anything that would help us.
06:41
He didn’t loan us stuff, he didn’t send his guys out to help us or anything.
06:49
The next guy that came in was Mike
06:55
Kerrick, and I never ever had any problem with Mike, and immediately,
07:04
people started cooperating.
07:08
They would set up a sale, then I’d get a call on the phone from one of the
07:15
pre-sale men, and he’d say, “What about
07:27
slope movement?
07:29
We’ve got such and such on this particular sale, and
07:35
we’d like to know a little more about whether we should be
07:40
logging that, or should restrict it,” or something like that.
07:44
And if I had a good answer, I would say so.
07:48
Most of the time, I would tell them to call you or Dick or Jack or somebody, and
07:56
try to talk to them about those things.
08:00
So, there started to be cooperation between the guys on the district and
08:05
me, and incidentally, the station [PNW]
08:11
. So, sort of the top down is what you’re saying, when Kerrick came
08:14
in he changed the attitudes of the people in the district there.
08:24
That occurred clear through Bill Aunsbaugh, when he was there.
08:29
There was no problem there at all.
08:32
He just let us keep working together.
08:40
It was a lot different, so it depends on the person who is there too.
08:51
The last couple rangers have been pretty good up there, too.
08:55
Oh, yeah.
08:55
The ranger now, she’s usually at the LTER meetings.
09:00
She comes into town for the meetings, and that would have been unheard of years ago.
09:08
Steve Eubanks and Lynn Burditt.
09:10
Were you there when Steve Eubanks was there?
09:12
Yeah.
09:16
I didn’t know him, but I knew of him.
09:17
I knew who he was and recognized him when he came to the meetings.
09:24
He was a guy that really wanted to apply what was being learned on the
09:29
Andrews right away, and to try it out.
09:33
It was a generational shift there of people working on the Andrews.
09:37
As I understand it, right about the time the program really transitioned into
09:42
the LTER, there were more registered people that were working up there,
09:48
and they tended to be more at the beginning of their careers, than earlier.
09:54
As somebody who lived in Blue River for a long period of time up until
09:56
then, did you see a change in the way people on the Andrews related
10:02
with the community of Blue River?
10:11
When they started to accept me, then they started to accept the Andrews pretty well.
10:18
The Andrews is kind of unique in a way.
10:22
It’s close and has a lot of things people like.
10:27
There’s good fishing in there, there’s lots of deer, and
10:31
there’s bear, that kind of thing.
10:34
Those people were so used to using it that way, when we started to
10:40
restrict things, there were people that weren’t too happy about that.
10:48
But, I didn’t see people get really angry like you might expect otherwise.
10:56
I think that was because
11:00
they had a little better idea of what the Andrews was doing.
11:06
They might not have agreed with everything we did, but we didn’t
11:15
go following people around on the Andrews to see what they were doing.
11:20
We had some vandalism, and there was not a hell of a lot you could do when you told
11:27
them, “No.” So, we didn’t run around the river telling everybody that they were
11:36
destroying the place.
11:38
But,
11:42
now the people that are on the Andrews live in the area, and most of them are
11:49
people who have been there a long time.
11:51
That was one thing that I wanted to know.
11:53
When Art comes in there in mid-70s, one of the things he started to focus
12:01
on, was building up the facilities of the headquarters site there,
12:05
and people started camping out on site instead of staying in motels
12:10
at Blue River and things like that.
12:11
I was curious
12:15
how much that affected the way people from Blue River viewed the Andrews.
12:20
I don’t think at the beginning it affected
12:25
too many people, because there weren’t too many motels and places
12:30
for people to stay on the river.
12:31
There were a few, but not many.
12:38
The people on the river that had motels and cabins and what have you,
12:44
had always relied on tourists, so they really weren’t impacted very much.
12:57
They always had tourists in there, and
13:07
there wasn’t any more than one or two
13:12
facilities available.
13:13
One was right there by the golf course.
13:22
And,
13:25
of course, we used all the restaurants.
13:29
Yeah, over
13:36
the years there’s a lot of restaurant meals and trading at the grocery store.
13:45
Well, as I understand it, you moved from Blue River to
13:48
Corvallis, in what, ‘76 or ‘78?
13:49
‘78.
13:50
‘78?
13:51
It was May of ‘78 when I came
13:56
out here.
13:56
Why’d you do that at that point?
13:58
Al had been trying for about two years to get me to move to Corvallis.
14:04
Mainly because
14:09
we had so many areas like Bull Run and the South Umpqua, they were
14:17
beginning to go down into northern California around Arcata, and doing
14:23
some drilling and putting in slope movement tubes and things like that.
14:30
And it was easier if we were all in Corvallis for our particular studies.
14:42
So, finally in
14:48
’68, I had decided that maybe we ought to move into Corvallis.
14:51
In other words, the work was moving off the Andrews into a broader range of sites?
14:55
Yeah.
14:56
‘78.
14:56
Yeah.
14:58
Al
15:16
talked to Dennis [Harr] and
15:22
Dick and everybody into the idea that
15:27
Art was leaning too much on me.
15:32
That there were things
15:36
that Art had problems with
15:43
that had to do with being, uh,
15:49
what’s the word I want?
15:54
If he didn’t like something the [Blue River] district did, he’d
15:56
practically start a fight sometimes.
15:58
He
16:01
didn’t get along with the guys in district too well.
16:05
And
16:08
because Art’s “one of those guys,” if he sees something wrong, he
16:12
-- -- Calls a spade a spade.
16:14
He doesn’t try any diplomacy, he just says
16:21
so.
16:23
So, when he’d run into a situation like that, sometimes he’d leave it
16:26
up to me to do something about it, and Al would say, “That’s not your
16:33
job anymore, that’s Art’s job.”
16:37
So, in other words, you’ve been there in the community for a long
16:39
time, so your long-term presence there gave you some leverage.
16:46
You had interaction with the district at a different level
16:50
it sounds like?
16:53
Yeah, we had social relations and parties, and from the first year that
17:01
I was there, we were included in those.
17:05
It took about a year, but from then on, if there was a party, then they would
17:18
talk to us and make sure that we were part of it.
17:22
You had mentioned earlier a little bit of friction with the district ranger,
17:27
the first one and the last one when you were there, but aside from that,
17:30
it sounds like your relations with the district people were pretty good then.
17:33
Oh, yeah.
17:39
When you left and came to Corvallis,
17:43
how often did you plan on going back to the Andrews?
17:46
We still had our own studies on the Andrews, and at the time,
17:55
we didn’t think
18:00
Art’s bunch
18:06
would carry on the studies in the way we wanted
18:11
them to.
18:12
There were indications that John Moreau
18:24
was the guy that did most of the stuff for them, and that he thought it was
18:29
important enough to do it that way.
18:33
We had a system set up that we felt gave us the best record, and there
18:42
were times when he didn’t think it was necessary to follow those rules.
18:53
So, we just kept doing
18:57
our thing, and every once in a while Al would say, “I think we
19:00
can let John take over this.”
19:05
So, eventually he was doing it, and he’s doing a real good job now.
19:10
It’s
19:14
the main reason I think why
19:18
it isn’t necessary to have so many technicians running around down there
19:24
for our studies.
19:25
If you think about the Andrews at the time you moved up to Corvallis,
19:31
and what it was like when you first started working there in ’66, what
19:35
kinds of things would you identify as main differences in terms of landscapes
19:39
or facilities or people there, and
19:44
how it had changed?
19:57
Seems to me, when I first moved up there,
20:05
I didn’t have a very good view of the big picture, of everything I was doing.
20:11
It was a question of just learning this and learning that and learning
20:14
something else, until I got to do the job and understood what I was doing.
20:24
When I got ready to leave,
20:28
that was second nature.
20:31
I felt
20:34
if I went out and something was wrong,
20:39
I knew how to fix it, that whatever I would do, even if it wasn’t according
20:44
to the study plan, I would do it if wouldn’t affect the study at all.
20:54
And also,
21:00
I was able to
21:05
look at various studies that were suggested and know that I could go in
21:10
and help build them, or I could help set them up, or I could help do them.
21:16
That is
21:19
what I had learned was important in preventing somebody from doing
21:30
something that would spoil their study.
21:35
At least I felt that
21:39
way.
21:39
You found that changing later?
21:43
Oh,
21:46
you mean at that time?
21:47
Well, I guess I misunderstood you.
21:50
I thought you were saying that this was the way you felt when you first
21:52
started working, as you started working there, and becoming used to it.
21:56
No, I meant when I left.
21:57
Oh, okay.
21:57
I mean, if they were going to set up a new study, then I had
22:03
people coming and asking me
22:08
about the study, and whether they should do this or do that or do something else.
22:18
I felt I had learned enough so that I could put some input into it, not that
22:25
they needed to do everything I said, but this was a problem that we had gone
22:35
through, and we found to be a problem.
22:39
And if you’ve got a way of doing things that will resolve that
22:45
problem, then there is no problem.
22:49
But,
22:56
people are not out there all the time,
23:01
and don’t really realize what is going on out there, any
23:09
more than I did when I started.
23:20
When I went out with Dick after I first came up, and I looked at Watershed 3
23:27
and it’s going across the flume, and it’s going across an area about so
23:34
wide, and it’s only about that deep.
23:40
It’s really kind of a nice, peaceful thing to happen.
23:48
When it starts to rain, and you go out there, you don’t have anything like that.
23:55
You have something that’s like this deep, and you reach down in
24:03
there with a bottle to get a water sample, and you can feel boulders.
24:09
Passing through the flume.
24:10
Yeah, passing through the flume.
24:11
That’s why it was designed that way, to pass them through.
24:13
Yeah.
24:14
And
24:19
you just don’t have any idea.
24:22
When most people are out there, they go out there during good weather.
24:26
They don’t go out during bad weather.
24:29
And yet, those things happen, and you’ve got to be prepared
24:34
when you set up a study.
24:37
The same thing happens because
24:41
of the snow.
24:41
I
24:46
felt a lot more comfortable out there then, than I would ever
24:51
have when I first started out.
24:52
I’m sure.
24:53
How did that kind of knowledge of on-site characteristics make its
24:59
way back so people designing the studies would have knowledge of it?
25:03
Were you involved at that level at all?
25:11
I don’t know,
25:14
other than just talking, like to Al and me.
25:17
Other people that design the studies, like Dick and Jack and maybe Dennis
25:25
Harr would have spent some time sampling in the middle of the night.
25:33
They know what’s going on.
25:37
They’re not just sitting in a lab, and having no field experience
25:43
and sampling during storms and
25:50
so on.
25:50
One of the comments in
25:54
the technician meeting that the technicians that we had at
26:08
the time were smart enough that they could understand what a study was all
26:15
about and what it was supposed to do.
26:18
If they went out and something was wrong, they could fix it.
26:26
Or come back saying this study has got to be changed.
26:31
Yeah.
26:37
I felt that by the time that I moved up here, that people would trust me
26:44
enough to do whatever needed to be done.
26:52
The biggest complaint at the technician meeting was that half of those
26:58
technicians never saw the study plan, because the study plan was stuck
27:02
away in somebody’s file and was never offered to them when they went out.
27:08
That is bad.
27:09
They didn’t know what they were supposed to be doing.
27:11
So, they didn’t really know what the study was supposed to be all about.
27:17
And they were treated like they didn’t know anything.
27:22
You said that didn’t really happen at the Andrews, in that way.
27:25
It did not happen in this project.
27:31
Going back a little bit, you were talking earlier about
27:35
your interaction with the Blue River District
27:40
[Willamette National Forest] , and a couple of examples of chance
27:41
interactions, like when they’re coming out to look for you, or when
27:47
these trees were marked for logging.
27:50
Was that a typical kind of interaction, or was there a more
27:52
common way that you would be dealing with them on a day-to-day basis?
27:56
How’d they get to know you so well, is what I’m asking?
27:58
Well, I had my office right in the station.
28:04
If I was in the station, I took my coffee break with everybody else.
28:10
So, I knew all the guys and I lived in the station house, which was right
28:15
in the middle of everybody else.
28:18
And that was all the way through the time that you left in ‘78?
28:20
Yeah.
28:20
Okay.
28:23
I was just thinking now with the headquarters up there on
28:26
the forest, it sounds like that opportunity is less common.
28:30
Is that true?
28:39
I think maybe not as much as it would have been, if we’d
28:43
been out there to start with.
28:50
There’s better communication now than there was before.
29:03
Cooperation is there if they want to ask for
29:11
it.
29:11
I think that when the cooperation wasn’t there at the beginning, it was
29:20
kind of a block to getting some
29:31
things done.
29:31
But, it didn’t take any time at all to run out there and pick up a
29:35
boulder and call somebody out there.
29:43
It sounds like things are a little bit more institutionalized now that
29:45
the cooperation level is higher?
29:47
Right,
29:51
right.
29:52
How are you doing for energy levels here?
29:54
We’ve been out here for a while here.
29:56
I’ve got a few more questions.
30:18
I wanted you to explain
30:23
how you would describe the level of staff involvement in decision-making
30:27
processes at the Andrews.
30:30
In other words,
30:32
how directly were you asked to participate in decisions about facilities on
30:38
the Andrews, studies on the Andrews,
30:43
problem-solving, those kinds of things?
31:02
I felt like, well, how would I put
31:06
it?
31:12
If Jack wanted something done, he would call.
31:18
If he wanted some information about something, he would
31:22
call and we would talk.
31:33
One time we decided to have a sale along Lookout Creek, and we were planning on
31:38
leaving a leave strip along the stream.
31:39
About
31:41
that same time, we were planning on
31:57
having a shelterwood sale [logging method retaining 40-50% of tree cover] , and
32:00
we’d been talking about shelterwood,
32:04
but we didn’t have anything on the Andrews that you could call a shelterwood.
32:09
So, Jack came down, and he and I went out and we laid the sale out.
32:17
And it wasn’t Jack saying, well, we’re going to do this,
32:20
this, this, this and this.
32:22
I wrote it down and we handed it in.
32:25
It was Jack asking me what I thought.
32:33
It was kind of a thing where I felt that
32:39
what I had to say was important.
32:43
And that’s the way Jack worked.
32:47
I never felt like Jack was one of those guys that would sit back and
32:51
just tell everybody what to do.
32:55
He just wasn’t that kind of a person.
32:57
Yeah.
33:00
He made it real easy to get the technicians and the
33:05
scientists to work together.
33:08
And he worked for some major changes in the way the place was run from the early
33:15
involvement with Jack and implementation of IBP, the transition to the long-term
33:22
ecological reserve, and the changes in the structure of the administration out there,
33:28
like Art McKee coming in as site director, the transition from Jerry Franklin to
33:38
Fred Swanson, things like that.
33:42
How did you see it from a staff perspective?
33:44
How did those kinds of changes influence the kinds of things that
33:48
you did, or the types of problems that you encountered and had to resolve?
33:52
Because we talked about it, apparently, there’s a pretty strong personal
33:55
relationship you had with Jack that helped solve a lot of problems.
33:59
Well, not only Jack, but Ted and Dick and Al and the other people that we
34:11
got together with.
34:17
There were some changes in
34:21
the kinds of studies that we took on, but they
34:32
were things that were small.
34:34
In
34:45
the studies Dick [Fredriksen]
34:53
was doing, Dick was doing most of the Watershed stuff.
35:01
Dennis Harr, who was also a hydrologist, had some ideas about
35:08
things he wanted to do that were different than what Dick was doing.
35:13
And so, there had to be some shifting of monies and effort
35:19
into some of those things.
35:21
Al and
35:29
I talked about this kind of a thing that was happening.
35:39
I don’t know that there were any
35:45
really hard feelings, except that I think both Fred and Dennis must have
35:53
felt they were just kind of sitting there twiddling their thumbs, because
36:01
there wasn’t enough money to do the things Dick was wanting to do, and the
36:06
thing that they were wanting to do.
36:10
So, there were some changes there, but
36:17
there was a period of time in there when Dick was
36:24
mentally not able to handle his part of it, and so things got changed.
36:35
He was kind of left doing his thing, or trying to finish up on his thing, and
36:50
not being able to finish
36:55
it.
36:55
That was kind of hard, because when he started having problems,
37:04
he would come down to my office
37:10
and say, “When you’re out there doing such and such, what is it that you
37:13
do?” Or, “What did you do at this particular time?” I would explain to him,
37:23
he would leave and
37:29
in about an hour, he’d come back and say, “Ross, tell me, when you were
37:34
out such and such at such a time
37:36
…” Exact same question?
37:37
Exact same question.
37:41
And, it was hard.
37:47
I had a lot of respect for Dick and what he was doing, what he
37:54
had found out and everything.
37:57
It was hard
37:59
to put up with that.
38:01
When did that start occurring?
38:03
What year?
38:05
Oh, that was in the early ‘80s.
38:09
Early ‘80s.
38:09
When we found out he [Fredriksen] had
38:16
Alzheimer’s,
38:19
we began to understand.
38:27
That kind of left it open then for Fred and Dennis to get in
38:35
their stuff, and we started making changes in things that we did.
38:41
And I began to learn things that I hadn’t known before, and that was fun.
38:50
It sounds like part of your job out there was continuously learning.
38:54
Oh, yeah.
38:55
Anytime anybody started a new study then it was.
38:59
Particularly, if I was supposed to do part of it, I had to
39:02
learn what it was we were doing.
39:05
And why.
39:05
And why.
39:07
If I was going to have to go out there and fix something, I had to know.
39:13
And, we spent five years
39:18
helping a fish
39:23
project that Bill [Meehan] had when he first started in our project.
39:31
He set up a five-year study
39:37
and
39:40
myself
39:43
and Friday and Carlos and Al did all the work.
39:48
Bill
39:52
would go out when he could, and when he couldn’t, we’d handle it.
39:57
So, we had this whole new fish study, and it involved all kinds
40:03
of collecting insects and counting fish and measuring fish and checking
40:11
the streamflow and everything else, so you’d just keep learning things.
40:22
One of the things here with the administrative changes I was talking
40:25
about earlier, you were talking about difficulties with getting a radio
40:31
and things like that earlier on.
40:34
How did you deal
40:39
with expenditures or equipment needs, things like that?
40:42
Yeah, they did.
40:43
Al
40:47
did a lot of checking around and trying to work with
40:55
companies like Bell Telephone.
40:59
We
41:01
were finally able to put a radio in a truck, so that at least we
41:07
had the radio along with the truck.
41:11
Then we were able to get access to a radio from the district that they
41:19
were either going to get rid of, or that we could buy separately.
41:27
We started getting those and when we did that, it helped us a lot in
41:31
some of the things we did, because we started doing a lot of surveying.
41:36
So, when we were studying
41:41
slope movement that
41:46
was some of the work of Fred and
41:51
George.
41:52
George was a geologist.
41:54
Those
41:56
two had studies set up for slope movement, and we did surveys the
42:04
full length of some of those slopes that were a mile-and-a-half long,
42:08
and with cross-lines and everything.
42:14
So, having the radios made it easier to communicate along those lines.
42:24
Then there were times when we needed a radio when
42:33
it was really necessary to get help.
42:39
So, it made a difference not having to go to the PNW Station to get approval?
42:42
I’m
42:46
trying to get a grip on where the money was coming from at this point.
42:50
Is it coming in through IBP?
42:52
The money was still coming from the PNW.
42:56
Oh, okay.
42:57
It’s just that we’re able now to
43:05
kind of channel it into a little bit different direction.
43:08
I
43:14
remember Al and I and Carlos and Friday, all going to the store buying new rain
43:23
clothes and rain boots and stuff like that, and the station [PNW] paying for it.
43:31
And then there came a time when they decided they didn’t want to do that.
43:38
But, we were able to
43:45
talk the station into being more safety conscious.
43:51
We tried to get them to
44:06
buy into sending at least two people instead of having just one guy go out.
44:14
It got to the point where we were going out with at least in
44:20
two people each time we went.
44:23
And the only time that we would go out by ourselves, would be if it was in the
44:30
middle of summer and things were easy and there wasn’t a great deal of danger.
44:38
It
44:50
sounds like, from what you said earlier, you always preferred to
44:53
have Al with you anyway when you were out there, so this is just more of a
44:57
formalization of a preference you had.
45:00
Right.
45:01
What did you do if Al wasn’t there?
45:03
Were there other people that you tried to take out in the field
45:06
with you, if Al wasn’t around?
45:09
We had Al and myself and George when he was here.
45:15
Carlos was
45:18
Spanish-American, and Friday was a Spanish-American.
45:22
Friday?
45:23
Friday, his name was Louis.
45:26
Okay.
45:32
He came with that name.
45:34
[Laughter] We asked him when he first got there what his name was, and he
45:39
said, “Friday.” So, that’s what we called
45:44
him.
45:45
Carlos’ last name was what?
45:47
Carlos’ name was Hernacia or something like that.
45:54
They were the ones that came in about the time you were building the shelters?
45:57
Yes, when we were doing rebuilding at 9 and 10 [watersheds]
46:07
. When I first started up there, one of my first jobs on 9 and 10
46:14
was to build a gauging station.
46:19
Then they put in the stilling well with a board across the top, then
46:26
set the instrument on top of that and put the float in, and they just
46:34
had a cover that they just set over
46:39
it.
46:39
Al said, “We need some stations.” He told me about what size, so
46:48
I spent part of the winter getting the material and making some stations.
46:57
In order to make them easy to haul up there and put together, I made each side
47:05
a unit in itself, and then I just drilled holes through and put bolts in them.
47:12
Did the same thing with the roof.
47:16
So, the first summer when we were up there, he and I took those
47:22
stations up and put them in place.
47:27
Along about the second year I was there, Dick decided
47:36
he needed more water samples.
47:41
What he needed was a system where he could get a series of samples that
47:51
represented the amount of water coming down and going through the flume.
47:57
The flume was a box
48:02
constricted at the front end; it’s called an H-flume.
48:10
At the beginning, we had those, and later, when he wanted to change it again,
48:14
he had us put in a different kind of a
48:18
flume.
48:19
We had to build a small building alongside the
48:25
regular station, and put our jugs and sampling equipment in there.
48:32
He made a timer box
48:42
that was activated by the height of the water,
48:48
in which a float passed through some magnets and operated some switches,
48:54
so the instrument would know what the height of the water was, and
48:59
how often it should take a sample.
49:04
So, we started out with this little gauging station with all this equipment in
49:10
it, and then, of course, one of the first things that happened, everything froze up.
49:16
All the tubes froze and we spent a lot of time working on that, trying
49:22
to get it so that it would always be available to take a sample.
49:28
That’s when we started
49:32
trying to figure out a way to heat the stations.
49:37
Then, a little later, Dick decided he needed more than what was there; he
49:45
needed something that really would work.
49:47
So, we redesigned all the stations.
49:52
By this time, I got a bright idea, and I told Al. I said,
50:05
“We do all this work and there was nothing to show
50:12
for it.” Our designs and labor, the materials, and all that kind of stuff.
50:28
There was nothing
50:31
that would deter anybody from going ahead and trying to do anything.
50:41
The thing that happens most of the time when you’re not a professional
50:49
builder, is it takes you forever.
50:54
Because you do something and you make a mistake, so you have to redo it.
51:00
Then you do some more and you make another mistake, and then you have to redo it.
51:04
So, it’d take all summer long to rebuild each station.
51:12
And, when we stopped to think about everything that we had to do, that was
51:18
about when things were beginning to change with the IBP and everything, and we were
51:24
getting more and more and more work.
51:28
To have to stop and rebuild that station was getting to be a real problem.
51:35
So, I suggested to Al we hire a carpenter and that he’d be the foreman.
51:46
He’d sit down and work out the details and materials that we would need, and we
51:54
could go out and order the material from wherever we could get it the cheapest.
52:00
In the meantime, he would tell us when to start, where to start, and
52:07
what to do and what not to do, and,
52:12
as it turned out, we got a really fine carpenter.
52:16
We got a contractor who had the time to spend.
52:20
He spent a whole month out there and we did two stations.
52:25
Who was that?
52:28
I can’t remember his name.
52:30
Okay.
52:30
He was from Blue River.
52:32
Well, he was from the other end of the south end Springfield.
52:35
Springfield.
52:38
Out toward that end, over Cedar Flats [Just east of Springfield near
52:45
McKenzie River] . Anyway, he would run up there and he’d line up the
52:49
work, and, boy, we did everything.
52:52
We hauled rock and we hauled concrete and we put in the flumes and did all the work.
53:02
Then, when it came time to do the house,
53:07
he says, “Okay Ross, I want you to take this down.” He said,
53:14
“You lay that board out there
53:18
and I’ll give you the figures.” And he’d measure and he’d give me
53:24
a number and I would measure on the board and make a mark, and he told
53:30
me everything and when we got done, he grabbed the saw and he went,
53:32
“zim, zim, zim.” And we had the side.
53:38
[Laughter] It took the two of us
53:44
probably about two hours, to put up all the side and framing of
53:50
the roof, and then he put two of the guys to put the shingles on.
53:55
And, we finished up with the windows and all that kind of stuff, and built steps
54:01
and anything that needed to be done.
54:05
So, it really was wise to have a carpenter.
54:07
Oh, yeah.
54:08
And it didn’t cost us all that much to get him to do that.
54:14
Leave it to a professional, huh?
54:15
We did 10
54:18
first, and then we went over and did 9 [experimental watersheds] . If
54:24
that did nothing else, it taught us how to do those things.
54:32
That’s why I felt like I could help.
54:38
Next to your experience on the Andrews?
54:40
Yeah.
54:41
So, were the two of you enough with all this help, is that right?
54:45
Yeah.
54:46
Okay.
54:49
We did everything but put the instruments in.
54:54
Then he was done at the end of that month, and we started putting
55:00
instruments in, setting them up and surveying the levels of the water and
55:07
everything in order to get them in right.
55:11
We were able to put some heaters in there so that it
55:19
wouldn’t freeze up on us and everything.
55:23
Do you recall how that person was contracted?
55:25
I’m
55:31
not sure.
55:32
I think Al probably went through the phone book.
55:35
Or
55:40
maybe he heard about him from somebody, I’m not sure.
55:45
But anyway, it was that kind of thing
55:53
that allowed us
55:57
not only to do the work, but to know what to do and to be able to
56:03
transfer that knowledge into all the rest of the stations that we put up.
56:12
We put up stations for
56:18
earthflow equipment and we put up stations on the Bull Run.
56:22
Dennis [Harr] had some studies up there.
56:25
It was just one of those things that Dennis says, “I want this,” and we did it.
56:31
I was
56:35
just thinking, we’re going over three hours here, we should probably
56:41
stop this.
56:42
The tape’s gonna run out in a second anyway.
56:44
But I just wanted to give you a chance, because I asked a lot of questions, and
56:47
if you had something that you wanted to add here that I hadn’t asked you.
56:51
Well, I was trying to figure out what it was you were going to want
56:58
to know, because a lot of the things that I know a lot of people know.
57:05
But the things that I thought of more than anything as far as the
57:12
Andrews, were the people that were involved, at least when I was there.
57:22
I think it
57:28
made the studies and the data and everything that we did, more
57:37
valuable.
57:38
It made it more true, just because of the kind of people that were
57:47
involved, not only as far as the data was concerned, but the things
57:57
that we kept shifting to and doing.
57:59
We had different
58:02
people who had different ideas about what to do.
58:06
They’re doing things up there now that wouldn’t have dawned
58:10
on me in a thousand years.
58:12
And they’re working off of satellites.
58:15
I can remember one time when I wondered why the heck we’re not doing that.
58:18
And then I forgot about it.
58:19
[Laughter]
58:19
They’re working off satellites totally?
58:19
GPS’s?
58:20
They’re doing weather reports and everything off of those.
58:20
Well, you had
58:31
a lot of experience working in different capacities, going into
58:34
the Marine Corps and things.
58:37
Was there something different about this group of people
58:45
that you hadn’t encountered before?
58:48
I think that they were willing to put some faith in whether I could do the job or
58:57
not.
58:58
I think in times before that, I wasn’t so sure that anybody thought that what
59:05
I had to say was worth listening to
59:15
– [continuing thoughts on next tape].
59:15
-- what was going on and how important it was.
59:28
I think if you’re going to help somebody, you’ve got to have some feeling
59:37
that they think you’re worth doing
59:43
it.
59:43
That’s the thing that I felt, and I don’t believe there was any time
59:58
at the beginning that I
1:00:01
didn’t feel that way.
1:00:04
Particularly when Jack started including me in everything, and
1:00:09
then listening to what I had to say.
1:00:11
I think it kind of pumps your ego and makes you want to do things right.
1:00:28
So that stayed pretty consistent in the various
1:00:35
periods of your work up there?
1:00:36
Yeah.
1:00:36
Well, probably we shouldn’t take up all
1:00:41
of your afternoon here.
1:00:41
I may be getting back in touch with you, especially about some of the periods we
1:00:46
haven’t talked a lot about since your time back here in Corvallis, things like that.
1:00:50
But, three hours is a pretty long time to be sitting there talking.
1:00:55
He handled it pretty good though.
1:00:56
Yeah, I like
1:01:00
your stories.
1:01:01
So, I’m gonna be working on this for the next several months here, and if
1:01:07
anything occurs to you, I’ve asked people to provide written comments,
1:01:13
if you have something you want to add, or recollections, people you think
1:01:17
I should talk to, things like that.
1:01:18
Hey, have you talked to George?
1:01:21
George.
1:01:21
Which one?
1:01:21
Lienkaemper?
1:01:22
No, I haven’t.
1:01:23
Well, it strikes me that might be a good idea to talk to George.
1:01:27
His office is right down the hall from mine, you know.
1:01:30
He’s kind of next to Carol Woods’ office.
1:01:35
I’ve got it in my notes.
1:01:40
He’s a GIS
1:01:43
guy now.
1:01:47
Computer guru.
1:01:49
Yeah.
1:01:50
What was his time frame of being up there?
1:01:52
He was up there a while.
1:01:57
I think
1:02:02
he started before I moved up, because he was working with Fred.
1:02:06
He was really kind of working as Fred’s helper.
1:02:10
When did you move up again?
1:02:11
‘78.
1:02:15
‘78.
1:02:16
Then I moved up, then he and I and Al, worked more together.
1:02:21
By then
1:02:24
Carlos and Friday had left.
1:02:28
So, there were just the three of us.
1:02:35
He was pretty sharp.
1:02:39
In fact he, he’d get tired of going up.
1:02:44
I think
1:02:47
Al was surprised, I guess, when George told him he didn’t want
1:02:52
to go out in the field anymore.
1:02:54
He wanted to do something else.
1:02:54
And then this other job came up.
1:02:57
Yeah, he’s happy as a clam.
1:02:59
He just sits there at his computer.
1:03:03
[Laughter]
1:03:03
He and I shared the office for a while,
1:03:11
next door to each other.
1:03:16
Way back before we started getting a lot of computers around there,
1:03:22
he was programming everything into his H.P. calculator, setting
1:03:28
things up and trying to show me how to run the thing.
1:03:34
And that’s the one thing that I had a hard time with.
1:03:39
You’re of the generation who has that the common complaint.
1:03:44
My kids, my grandkids, know more about computers than I do.
1:03:47
Oh yeah, but they’re growing up with it, you know.
1:03:49
There’s not that phobia that the rest of us have to battle.
1:03:52
I’m not sure if I was telling you or Fred, but I’ve been putting
1:03:56
material into a computer database.
1:03:58
It’s about the point where it would be useful to actually
1:04:02
bring into the interviews.
1:04:03
I could punch up on there, if you were having trouble remembering the names
1:04:06
of stuff, I could bring them up, if you have enough of a word database.
1:04:10
Well, Fred and
1:04:16
George, but mainly Fred, did a lot of walking around the Andrews.
1:04:22
He walked all over that place.
1:04:26
He must have at least hit everyplace that you and Jerry hit.
1:04:29
Yeah, yeah.
1:04:32
Only he was digging, he was digging soil pits.
1:04:35
He knows that place really well.
1:04:38
Now which Fred are
1:04:50
you talking about?
1:04:50
Fred Swanson.
1:04:51
I don’t know whether this stuff is in the file still.
1:04:56
One
1:05:01
of the old files was still in the office there, and in it are some old studies.
1:05:11
The one I remember that was really interesting was the study
1:05:18
they made on the road that they first built up to the Andrews.
1:05:21
That would be Roy Silen?
1:05:26
Was it the access road?
1:05:27
It was the access road that went up to the Andrews.
1:05:31
The district built the road, or at least the logging company did.
1:05:33
The records
1:06:09
had to
1:06:12
show how big it was, how long it was, how much per mile it cost to
1:06:19
build it, and everything that they did.
1:06:20
Must be late ‘40s or something, huh?
1:06:22
Yeah, yeah.
1:06:22
Yeah, it was another four years before Roy was up there, so I’d like to see that.
1:06:31
When Roy first started there wasn’t any road in there at all.
1:06:36
And, the road went up to the scout camp.
1:06:41
That was about it.
1:06:42
Where was the scout camp?
1:06:43
Was it located by a swimming hole?
1:06:44
Let’s see, where was it?
1:06:44
The camp was right at
1:06:57
the junction, wasn’t it?
1:06:59
Right where the road connects.
1:06:59
Saddle Dam, right in
1:07:04
there.
1:07:04
Wasn’t it there?
1:07:05
Oh, the Saddle Dam, there.
1:07:08
Wow, that’s not very far in.
1:07:10
Saddle Dam is that first little dam on Blue River Reservoir.
1:07:13
Oh, okay.
1:07:14
Yeah, just as you hit Blue River Reservoir.
1:07:17
Yeah, that’s right.
1:07:17
Well, in the first years that I went up there, they were
1:07:22
still using that old road.
1:07:26
We would come up the hill past the Saddle Dam, and then go down that old road.
1:07:32
At the time they were working on the road that’s there now.
1:07:38
At night when I would run in there to get water samples, I would come onto spots
1:07:46
where there were parts of a slope sliding out across the road, and it was just like
1:07:55
gravy
1:07:58
moving.
1:07:59
And I’d go around the toe of it and then I’d just step in it, so that I could
1:08:04
get out there and get my samples and get back before it closed the road off.
1:08:10
Yeah, that’s what happened during the storms.
1:08:12
And I think that was the old road that was in the study.
1:08:16
That’s definitely something I’d like to get my hands on,
1:08:20
one of the old logging plans.
1:08:22
I
1:08:35
think
1:08:43
the first people in there.
1:08:44
Like Don Gray.
1:08:47
Did you ever meet him?
1:08:49
He
1:08:53
put in a lot of tubes to measure slope movement.
1:08:58
He did them on Watershed 1, he did them on that interface between 2
1:09:05
and 3 [watersheds] , and he did them down 9 and 10 [watersheds]
1:09:11
. That doesn’t ring a bell, he must have been after ‘74.
1:09:13
He started in ‘68, and that was the first year that he got out there.
1:09:13
Is that right?
1:09:13
Don Gray [Professor-University of Michigan] . You know, the name sounds
1:09:13
familiar, but I can’t picture him or
1:09:32
anything.
1:09:33
Where’s he at now?
1:09:34
Doug Swanston didn’t exactly like some of the work that he did, but I’ve got
1:09:45
his
1:09:57
report; must be still out in the garage.
1:10:00
I’ve got his study, anyway.
1:10:03
Is he still around?
1:10:05
Well, he was from Michigan and he came out in the summer and set those up, in
1:10:10
fact; he set them up in Seattle, some here, and some down in California.
1:10:14
Don Gray.
1:10:14
He was an engineer.
1:10:14
So,
1:10:21
he published a report on this?
1:10:23
Yeah.
1:10:24
Where did it appear?
1:10:25
I
1:10:35
don’t know whether it was in a journal.
1:10:38
I know it was in a publication like this
1:10:45
[USFS report]
1:10:45
. That’s one of those things that you could get back to me about.
1:10:46
If it occurs to you, let me know.
1:10:48
Yeah, if you could, write a note or something.
1:10:51
I was trying to think of, I forgot about Fred, I mean about Doug Swanston, too.
1:10:59
Did he do any work down there though?
1:11:03
He put in some [inclinometer] tubes.
1:11:05
On the Andrews?
1:11:06
On the Andrews.
1:11:08
He put them
1:11:13
on
1:11:17
the slide that comes down across Lookout Creek,
1:11:23
above the road junction that goes to Carpenter, there’s a big slide
1:11:31
that goes clear across the creek.
1:11:31
Kind of a land flow [earthflow] type of thing, yeah.
1:11:33
And he put in some tubes there.
1:11:36
What are they, strain gauge tubes, or what?
1:11:40
No, they were inclinometer tubes.
1:11:42
He put them in there and down
1:11:50
at Powers [Oregon]
1:11:51
. Did you help him on this?
1:11:53
Well, Carlos and Friday did a lot of the work to put them in.
1:12:00
And then, I helped read them all.
1:12:04
Spent a lot of time running around doing that.
1:12:06
What years would be?
1:12:08
Oh, that
1:12:15
seems to me like
1:12:19
it was in ’70.
1:12:22
Boy,
1:12:30
they started up before I moved from Blue River, so it had to be before ‘78.
1:12:39
Maybe ‘75, somewhere around there.
1:12:42
‘75, yeah.
1:12:43
That’s the year after I left.
1:12:46
And then, not long after that, Doug went back to Alaska.
1:12:50
Went back to Alaska, you’re right.
1:12:51
He was only there for a year or two.
1:12:53
Yeah, but he had tubes there, he had tubes down at Powers, he had tubes
1:12:58
down in California, near Arcata.
1:13:07
That was something.
1:13:07
They got a drill rig and took it out on those slopes, and there were times
1:13:15
when they had to winch the rig around so that they could sit on the slope,
1:13:21
and then jack it up so they could get a straight shot with the drill.
1:13:30
You
1:13:35
were saying that was Swanston [Doug] , didn’t you?
1:13:39
One of the things that makes that system work, or not, is that you have to make
1:13:45
sure the bottom end is in bedrock.
1:13:49
And there’s some ways of making sure.
1:13:54
And he never was sure.
1:13:55
Don Gray wasn’t sure.
1:13:57
Well, Doug wasn’t sure either.
1:13:58
No, not Don Gray?
1:14:00
Don Gray got them in the bedrock.
1:14:06
But, there were some questions in there.
1:14:10
But these are all people that got started on the Andrews and helped.
1:14:15
Well, we should probably call an end to it here.
1:14:16
Let me
1:14:23
give you my card here, if you do find some more material.
1:14:27
Keep this to make a copy, and I’ll give it back to you.
1:14:30
Sure, I may have another copy, but it’d be quicker to, if you copy it.
1:14:38
And
1:14:42
like I said, if anything does occur to you, or if you find some, what
1:14:46
are you trying to track down here?
1:14:46
Oh, this was in the Springfield paper one time.
1:14:46
What’s the date on
1:14:57
that anyway?
1:14:57
‘75.
1:15:17
‘75, look
1:15:41
at
1:15:45
that.
