00:01
[resumes recording] Okay, go ahead.
00:02
Well, it’s not a very long story.
00:04
I said that Jerry and I were both working on subalpine fir at the same time.
00:09
He was working on it from an ecological standpoint, and I was to some extent,
00:15
but my focus was the balsam woolly
00:19
aphid.
00:20
It was killing a lot of subalpine fir at the lower elevations of where
00:26
subalpine fir grows along the Cascades.
00:29
Anyhow, he comes to me one day and asks, “What’s your impression about how
00:37
subalpine fir grows?” I said, I think it’s a pioneer species.
00:44
Before, we always said it was highly
00:50
tolerant to shade.
00:52
That’s the byword, everybody says that trees grow highly tolerant to shade
00:58
and grew up underneath [shade of other trees] , but subalpine fir didn’t
01:00
fit that model, despite the fact that that’s what it was supposed to act like.
01:03
He and I agreed on that, and we started comparing notes and so forth.
01:03
So, we wrote this paper on the successional status of subalpine fir
01:03
in the Cascade Range, and threw in stuff on the balsam woolly aphid,
01:03
which at that time looked like it could pretty much wipe out subalpine
01:03
fir in some critical environments, particularly on avalanche slopes.
01:03
That’s how we got we got together and how this paper was turned out.
01:03
Hmm.
01:03
Had you known him before that?
01:03
Yeah, I knew him before that.
01:03
We’re both about the same age, we both came to the station
01:03
[PNW] about the same time.
01:03
When was this, roughly?
01:05
Huh?
01:12
When was this study, roughly?
01:13
When was that?
01:13
Must have been around ’65, something
01:23
like
01:58
that.
02:01
I can’t remember now.
02:04
Well, you knew Jerry from the station, and that was when the station was small,
02:10
so pretty much everybody knew everybody.
02:11
Yeah.
02:11
Everybody knew everybody in the station those days.
02:13
So, you knew him, but you really hadn’t worked with him until this project?
02:17
No, no.
02:17
And did you work with him after this much?
02:19
No, I never worked with him after that, much, other than we talked to each other
02:24
about various things we were doing.
02:26
And occasionally, we asked each other’s advice on something that
02:29
one knew more about than the other one did, but that’s about it.
02:34
Your insights that this species was a pioneer species; what
02:43
was the origin of that insight?
02:43
That the tree was a pioneer species?
02:46
Yeah, the tree.
02:47
From
02:50
the way he was working with it, Jerry found out it only seemed to
02:55
be growing on open spots, and that’s the same impression that I’d got.
03:00
When I was working in stands where I had subalpine fir and silver fir, I
03:05
always had lots of silver fir coming up underneath, and I never had any
03:08
subalpine fir coming up underneath.
03:10
And where there was subalpine fir, it was always in some avalanche track
03:15
or in a meadow, where the beavers had dammed it up long ago, and then
03:20
the trees had invaded the edge, and they were always subalpine fir.
03:23
It was out growing in the open in the sun.
03:24
That was always
03:32
my impression.
03:33
I didn’t really study it.
03:34
I just looked at it.
03:35
But it sure looked to me like this was a pioneer species.
03:38
And lava beds, that was the other place that they were constantly
03:42
[growing] . They always got into lava beds, one of the few trees that does.
03:50
Nobody had ever made that connection before?
03:51
Nobody’d seen it, at least,
03:54
nobody had worked at it in the region.
03:55
As a matter of fact, when I first started working out on the
04:01
aphid, we weren’t sure how to tell the difference between
04:03
subalpine fir and silver fir.
04:06
[Laughs] They grow in the same places and sometimes they look the same.
04:09
Once you get onto them, it’s
04:14
a cinch.
04:15
But at first we didn’t know, and that’s because nobody had ever worked on
04:21
them.
04:22
They were just a couple species that “flew on by,” and nobody paid attention to them.
04:25
Well, the only question I’ve got, is
04:32
if you’ve got any issues that you think this study ought to be addressing.
04:54
Anything in particular that you’d like to see?
04:56
In relation to studies on the Andrews?
04:57
On the Andrews?
04:57
Uh-huh.
04:57
No.
04:58
I’ll probably regret not saying anything.
04:59
I always thought that if you could get up and look at what’s up in the tall
05:03
trees, that it would be interesting.
05:06
Not that it would be worth anything, but
05:10
it must be a different life up there, but I never knew how you would do that.
05:14
But I guess they’re addressing that.
05:17
You mean the canopy work?
05:18
Yeah, working in canopies, and they’ve got better equipment
05:21
for doing that now than we did.
05:25
Regeneration, also.
05:26
I guess
05:33
regeneration insects, and seed and cone insects, those are two things
05:38
that never got addressed very well.
05:40
We don’t know what happens to all that regeneration that starts out
05:46
1-year-olds, 2-year olds, and so forth.
05:48
You know, there’s a terrific population.
05:51
When I was counting regeneration, there’s a terrific population of
05:57
Douglas-fir and other things, other trees.
06:02
Yew, for example, grows a lot out there, and then it all disappears.
06:07
I don’t know where it goes.
06:10
But I would like to have seen some sort of a life cycle study on regeneration
06:15
that’s really good, that would identify what’s taking out regeneration.
06:19
Because my feeling is that there’s a lot of insects that we don’t even
06:26
acknowledge as being the problem, or that are even involved in that.
06:32
These
06:35
are questions that kind of interested you, but you didn’t have the
06:37
resources, or the opportunity?
06:38
I never had the opportunity to do it.
06:40
I always wanted to work on regeneration insects, and I always
06:44
wanted to work on seed and cone
06:48
insects.
06:49
Nobody else was interested, I mean, people who had money, who had control
06:55
of the money, weren’t interested.
06:56
Well,
06:59
we should probably end this, but if you want to take a look at that, if you
07:03
have time to look at that prospectus.
