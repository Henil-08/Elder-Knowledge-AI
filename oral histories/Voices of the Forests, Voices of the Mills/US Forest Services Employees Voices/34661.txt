00:01
This is the interview with Roy Silen on 9th August, or 9th September 1996
00:07
for the Andrews study, interview by Max Geier at his office.
00:24
Let’s sit here at the computer and take a look at this [personal resume]
00:29
. Is this something you put together?
00:29
Yeah.
00:29
I built that.
00:30
I just kind of kept a career record.
00:31
Okay.
00:31
Good.
00:32
Here are things that I did before I got to the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:38
Here's the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:38
I felt a real sense of accomplishment there.
00:38
Yeah.
00:38
That's good.
00:38
Have you been keeping this up
01:06
as you went along?
01:07
Yeah.
01:07
I got it up-to-date.
01:24
Many of these are publications.
01:27
Is there a way we can print this out?
01:29
I've got it set now so it prints on another
01:36
printer that isn't always available.
01:39
The lady that shifted it over is coming back and shift it to this one.
01:44
Either way, we can probably print this out.
01:47
That
01:52
would be really helpful.
01:52
We’re into the stuff that you really want there.
01:56
It’s nice to get this kind of material;
02:00
words of the person actually responsible for it.
02:04
I often get people going through publications and writings by others.
02:07
What you've got
02:28
here
02:30
is your own.
02:30
Oh, yeah.
02:33
What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit more about your
02:34
involvement with various people
02:37
out there.
02:38
This is real good.
02:39
Well, you’re the first one to see it.
02:42
I did it after I retired
02:46
to help remember what things were.
02:56
If you can promise me you'll give me a copy of this, why don't we go ahead?
02:59
Sure.
03:02
There's a couple of
03:13
things we talked about last time that
03:20
I want to revisit here.
03:21
Probably the most important thing here is to get context on who you were working
03:26
with at the time you started working at
03:29
the Andrews.
03:30
You started in 1948 and worked until 1954.
03:34
Could you talk about your academic background and how you came to that point
03:36
in your academic and professional career?
03:41
My background is being with the forest through my whole life.
03:44
I was born in Coos Bay/North Bend.
03:47
Then, I went to North Bend High School.
03:49
Of course, North Bend was a logging and shipping community.
03:52
My dad had a boat, and we towed lots of [log] rafts and that sort of thing.
03:59
It was quite nice.
04:03
Graduated from North Bend High School.
04:06
The next two years I worked for a logging company as their bookkeeper.
04:13
Couldn't get any other job, which was fine with me.
04:17
I saved enough money to go to school, and went to live with my sister Luanne.
04:19
I didn't have any parental help, so I was on
04:25
my own.
04:25
I went to San Mateo Junior College the first year.
04:31
Tried to get a job in the San Francisco area, and couldn’t.
04:33
Came back to Oregon.
04:35
Back into the woods.
04:38
How come you went to San Mateo?
04:40
Well, my sister lived at Burlingame for one thing.
04:45
They let us know, most of our high school group, that there was
04:48
a junior college that was free.
04:53
A group of four preceded me by one year there, and they established a coop house.
05:00
So, it was very cheap living and that was very important at the
05:03
time [Great Depression] . I spent a year down there and came to
05:06
Oregon State to study forestry.
05:10
What years were
05:13
you at Oregon State?
05:15
'39
05:21
to '42.
05:22
Okay.
05:22
Then, in
05:25
'42 you went into the army?
05:26
I enlisted in the reserves.
05:29
I spent most of the time in anti-aircraft artillery.
05:36
Then, at the end, I shifted over into the infantry.
05:42
Spent the last year in the war in the infantry.
05:46
What was your primary field of study at
05:51
OSU?
05:51
Forestry; Forest Management and a minor in Logging Engineering.
05:54
And
05:57
your goal at that time was to eventually go into private forestry?
05:59
Yes it was.
06:00
I thought I'd go back to Coos Bay.
06:02
But I never did.
06:05
So then, after the army?
06:07
In the army when still overseas, I applied to the experiment
06:09
station for a job and got it.
06:12
I went directly out of the army into the experiment station.
06:15
I started in '46, summer of '46 in the experiment station, and I was there for
06:20
my whole career.
06:22
Who did you work with initially?
06:23
Oh, it was a great, great experience.
06:26
I immediately came under Thornton Munger, who was head of the
06:32
[PNW] station at that time.
06:34
So, near the end of his tenure?
06:36
Yeah.
06:36
It was at the end of his tenure.
06:37
He was there four or five years while I was there.
06:38
As
06:41
a result, I got to re-measure a lot of his plots, because they had
06:48
been neglected through the war.
06:50
Oh, yeah.
06:51
That's where the genetics experience started.
06:55
I didn't know it.
06:58
I was more interested in forestry.
07:00
Then, I almost immediately got under Leo Isaac, silviculturist of the
07:06
experiment station, and he helped.
07:08
I couldn’t have gotten a better silviculture and regeneration background
07:16
than I was getting, just working for
07:23
them.
07:23
Trial by error?
07:24
Yeah.
07:25
Sure.
07:25
I was visiting all the plots, re-measuring all their plots.
07:29
It was seriously neglected all through the war, so when they were in a high
07:34
level of activity of trying to catch up with their measurements, I was
07:38
involved with almost all of that.
07:40
Okay.
07:40
It was quite an experience to see
07:44
all the facets.
07:44
Then, I came under the influence of a man named Bob Aufderheide,
07:50
who eventually was
07:55
supervisor of the Willamette National Forest, the biggest national forest
07:59
at this time, but first, he had a couple years with the station [PNW]
08:08
. The Forest Service up until World War II, had been a protection agency.
08:14
Fire protection was their most important
08:18
activity.
08:21
Cutting began heavily after World War II, so fire started to take
08:26
second place to timber management, and the Forest Service was very
08:30
ill-prepared for this level of cutting.
08:34
Bob Aufderheide's
08:37
contribution was that he felt that we shouldn't let the loggers lay out the
08:45
cutting pattern, because they had no idea what silviculture really meant.
08:50
He believed we should learn to do enough of the sale or logging layout, to
08:57
handle this very important phase of silviculture, because where you
09:03
establish the roads and the landings, will determine how you handle that piece
09:08
of land from then on, in most ways.
09:11
He said, let's lay out the roads and landings for the loggers, make
09:17
the cutting boundaries, and try to get as much silviculture work
09:22
into the logging plan as we could.
09:24
We had a publication that Bob Ruth and I put out: “Getting More Forestry
09:30
into the Logging Plan,” a best seller at the PNW Station for several years;
09:37
many thousands of copies went out.
09:40
That was in late '42?
09:41
That was in the late '40s.
09:44
By then,
09:47
both Bob Ruth and I went to heading up experimental forests, Bob
09:53
going to Cascade Head Experimental Forest, myself to the Andrews.
09:57
Both of us were involved in roads into the experimental forests and layouts
10:03
of timber sales on an experimental basis.
10:07
Okay.
10:08
I
10:16
think we had quite an influence on upgrading silviculture to the
10:23
harvest phase, because we became some of the people who looked
10:29
at getting this information out.
10:32
Uh-huh.
10:32
You’ve seen this record and some of the publications from all that?
10:42
We [laughs] found our pieces of information, like what would you
10:48
suppose was the most expensive part of the harvest operation.
10:56
Very few people when you ask them that will tell you, "Turns out to be boilers."
11:03
Hmm.
11:04
It’s because during the fire season you have what they call “hoot owling;” which
11:08
is when you go out early in the morning to try to get the logging done, and then
11:11
quit before it gets too hot and dry in the day. If you go out on one of those
11:16
days, your whole crew is out there, you’re paying for them, then you get
11:19
word that you can't work, so they all go in and you get no more logging done.
11:21
It sure raises the cost.
11:23
[Laughter] That sort of thing.
11:24
But, people
11:29
do
11:38
not realize these things.
11:38
Did you and Bob Ruth communicate about the different experimental forests?
11:39
Yes, of course.
11:39
Bob Aufderheide would visit between the experimental forests
11:42
at Cascade Head and H. J. Andrews.
11:45
The H.J. Andrews at the time had not been opened up at all.
11:51
There was a contract to build a road, an access road under the
11:58
access road program, into the Blue River and Lookout Creek drainages.
12:03
That had been completed only a mile or two when I got there in ‘48/’47.
12:08
I
12:12
got into the experiment station in '46.
12:16
I think I worked a year-and-a-half at Portland, and then, I was at
12:20
Willamette Research Center here at Corvallis, I think in '47 and into ’48.
12:25
I guess I worked there the first year in '48, somewhere in '48.
12:29
Anyway, the records will show
12:34
that.
12:34
The road was only up into where the – [unintelligible recording]
12:36
Oh no, you had to walk in before you got to the boundary
12:40
of the experimental forest.
12:40
So it’s all untouched, such a virgin area.
12:48
This is an example.
12:50
I could come off the south hillside and go down to Lookout Creek, carefully.
12:54
If there was a deep hole there, I’d take a little branch and stick it out to
12:58
the center of the hole, the fish would come from all directions to see what
13:03
was going on, just like in a hatchery.
13:06
I noticed that.
13:06
But it didn't take long after the loggers got in there
13:09
before that no longer happened
13:11
-- Yeah.
13:12
-- in that situation.
13:14
That's a phase that I want to cover here, too, in that once we got into
13:20
large-scale cutting, we began to get cooperators and other guys coming in.
13:25
The Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit established two people there.
13:31
One, full-time through the summer, and the other one was
13:34
part-time through the whole year.
13:35
The one full-time through the summer, his name was Wustenberg;
13:47
he was a fisheries man, wasn't he?
13:50
The animal damage man was Jay Gashwiler.
13:55
Both those two were active through most of the time I was there, summer time
14:03
or the fall, keeping up their plots.
14:06
So, we had a good line on what was going on from the wildlife and fish
14:12
standpoints, all through that period.
14:15
Okay.
14:16
For example,
14:19
Wustenberg sampled the number of fish in a hole, by a sein through
14:25
the hole, and clipping the fins and throwing the fish over the net.
14:31
What would you think would be the number of fish we would find, oh, four
14:37
inches or longer in a hole, that was say 80 feet long and 20 feet wide,
14:43
on the Andrews Experimental Forest?
14:43
Do you have any idea?
14:45
Or did I tell you earlier?
14:46
You asked me this last night, it was somewhere over a thousand.
14:48
Over a thousand, yes!
14:49
About 1,100 fish!
14:54
[Laughter] It was incredible, of course, it didn’t last very long.
14:58
The activity that Jay Gashwiler was into was all the book-keeping on
15:07
seedlings coming in and seedlings going out; the animal damage route.
15:14
He kept track of that.
15:16
His main contribution was to show that, despite all of the animal predation and
15:23
loss from heat injury and so on, all the plots he was establishing, I think
15:29
4-meter-square plots, all these plots were regenerated, restocked, by 10 years.
15:40
Regeneration took a lot longer than most people expected, but it was succeeding.
15:47
Nonetheless, almost everything on the Andrews Experimental Forest was planted.
15:49
These cooperators with the Oregon Wildlife, is this
15:59
unusual compared to Cascade Head, for example?
16:01
They didn't have anything like this out at Cascade Head.
16:03
Do you know why these people were on the Andrews at that time?
16:04
Well, it was a matter of serendipity.
16:04
I think this was the kind of area they were looking to protect.
16:05
It had lots of things they were looking for, and they wanted it
16:07
to be in an old-growth forest.
16:07
They were there after you arrived, or about the same time as
16:21
you showed up?
16:21
No.
16:26
It was
16:28
after I arrived.
16:29
Okay.
16:30
It probably was because I was returning to Oregon State and making some
16:35
contacts, that this word got around.
16:38
Then you came back to Oregon State?
16:40
No, I just kept visiting, is all.
16:42
Oh, I see.
16:44
So, while you were laying-out the roads, basically, you were
16:51
in contact with people here?
16:51
Do you know where they were headquartered?
16:53
They were headquartered on campus here.
16:55
Okay.
16:55
The Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit.
16:57
I think it’s
17:02
still here.
17:03
Okay.
17:04
Who
17:11
was your contact here at Oregon State?
17:11
My own job was set by the Willamette National Forest or the region
17:16
[Regional Office of the National Forest System; logging rates in agreement
17:16
between National Forest System and PNW Research Station] . We were to
17:18
harvest 20 million board feet a year from this [experimental] forest.
17:23
I interpreted that as
17:27
not being practical, because it would take three or four years after we got started,
17:32
before we could begin the first harvest.
17:33
I said we would lay out and present for sale, 20 million feet of timber a year.
17:40
I did that as soon as I could.
17:41
The first year we set up a sale of, I think, 7 million board feet.
17:48
Something around there.
17:50
It may not have been that high.
17:51
Anyway, that sale was advertised, and nobody bid on it.
17:56
Mmm.
17:57
And so, the second year we had a successful timber
18:00
sale, and that was Sale #1.
18:03
Those were the first units that were in the experimental forest, and the one that
18:09
brought the road system initially into the area and up to the 3000-foot level.
18:15
Uh-huh.
18:16
Let's see, what else would be of importance there?
18:22
We actually laid out about 80 million board feet of area to get to 20 million
18:30
board feet, because we had the concept that we would have a complete layout of
18:36
the sale for the entire area before we sold the units that would go out first.
18:44
We cut one unit out of four so that you were completely
18:51
surrounded by timber each time.
18:53
What was your perception of the purpose of the experimental forest at that time?
19:01
At the beginning, it was rather simple.
19:03
I was to lay out 20 million board feet a year.
19:06
They had no other instructions.
19:10
As far as research I did, that was up to me, if I could get everything else done
19:15
-- -- Timber management?
19:16
Yes, it was straight forward timber management.
19:18
But,
19:23
I had had some experience with Bob Aufderheide at Cascade Head Experimental
19:29
Forest, and some on the Siuslaw [National Forest] where we tried some of these sale
19:32
layouts he was proposing, and so I wasn't completely green at it going in there.
19:32
In fact, I was as well-experienced as most anyone in the Forest Service
19:32
at that time, for logging out here.
19:46
So, we began and I laid out these sales, and it was in a very tough piece
19:51
of country in the first sale, because it was in a small watershed area.
19:56
To get roads up through that land, it was very chopped up.
20:02
So, that sale didn't go.
20:04
Thank goodness it didn't go, because it allowed us, as the watershed people
20:09
became interested in the area, to propose that these three watersheds
20:12
be paired up with stream gages.
20:16
Otherwise, it would have been sold as timber sales.
20:19
So, the second sale avoided that area; came in further on
20:25
upstream and took timber out.
20:28
Your first sale didn't go through?
20:30
No.
20:30
The first sale didn't go through.
20:31
Okay.
20:33
And the watershed people you were mentioning?
20:34
They were from the Portland office.
20:34
Who
20:36
would they be?
20:36
Any examples?
20:36
Names have completely escaped me.
20:36
Bill Bullard was in charge of it, at the experiment station, and, Jack, not Jack
20:37
Rothacher….Jerry, gosh, what was his name?
20:38
These
21:06
are Portland office people [May be referencing Jerry Dunford]
21:07
. Okay.
21:08
I only saw them when they visited.
21:10
They’d visit, give me some instructions, and leave.
21:13
[Laughter] “Gather some data and send it to us,” and then, they’d never
21:16
come down except once in a while.
21:17
They were attracted there during the first sale you made?
21:21
Well, once we saw what they wanted to know and what the opportunities were, we sat
21:28
down and looked over the three watersheds, and decided, “That's pretty good.”
21:31
Then, we didn't have maps of the area.
21:35
We had mapped out that sale one area by hand-methods.
21:42
[Laughter] And so, we had a map they could look at, and this was quite attractive
21:47
to them, these three paired-watersheds.
21:49
Hmm.
21:51
That's how that got started.
21:53
So, they were just looking around for research opportunities?
21:55
Sure.
21:56
That's right.
21:59
You mentioned already there were some problems in that first
22:02
sale, getting roads in there.
22:04
Yes.
22:05
It was chopped-up country with very steep slopes.
22:09
Watersheds
22:15
1, 2, and 3 are canyons.
22:21
Right.
22:23
That's a question I want to address here.
22:25
First of all, your first impressions of where to go and what to do on the
22:29
Andrews, and the logistical problems you encountered in deciding how to lay out
22:34
the roads and actually accomplish it.
22:36
After our first year, we got pretty good at
22:44
it.
22:44
Just as an example, we had a logger named Mike Savelich.
22:48
He worked for Associated Plywood Mills, and they got all our sales.
22:53
I think there was a little collusion going on.
22:55
[Laughs] But any way, they've always been successful bidding
22:58
for experimental forest sales.
23:01
I remember the nasty notes he would write.
23:05
He would blaze a side on a yew tree, and then take some tile and write a note.
23:11
One of his notes was, "Roy, this is fine place for a road,
23:16
but I want no part of her."
23:21
[Laughter] Then, two years later his roadbuilder and I were talking,
23:29
and he [builder] said, "There
23:33
was a guy that wanted to propose a change in this curve
23:38
that you put through here, so
23:46
if we do it this way, we can save a lot of money,” and Mike said, “Damn it.
23:51
Every time I change Roy's plans it costs me money.” So, I succeeded there.
23:57
[Laughter]
23:58
Mike Kerrick mentioned that Mike Savelich was notable because
24:03
he hired primarily Croatians.
24:06
Oh yes, sure.
24:07
Were you the person responsible for deciding who would be hired there?
24:11
No.
24:12
See, that was sold as a timber sale and
24:14
-- -- So that was through the region?
24:14
And the Willamette Forest, actually, were the ones that
24:18
administered the sales part of it.
24:21
We administered the research part of it.
24:22
And sometimes that took a lot of coordination.
24:25
Particularly the watershed phases of it, because we were trying to essentially
24:32
stop sedimentation in that drainage.
24:34
We found out at the very beginning that the watershed problem and
24:39
sedimentation were synonymous.
24:41
That was it.
24:42
If you could stop the sedimentation, you didn't have a watershed problem.
24:46
So, we started in looking for the sources of
24:52
sedimentation.
24:52
Don Wustenberg, a fisheries person, came to me one day in the
24:57
summertime and said, "Do you know
25:01
that there are no more fish in this stream that I'm suppose to work with?" I
25:05
said, "No, I didn't know that." He said, "Let's go up and see them." Every one
25:08
of the pools was filled with sediment.
25:11
It all came from the roads.
25:13
Roads and tractor logging.
25:15
So, we began to really work on that and we found that, in the tractor logging places,
25:20
there were many things you could do to cut down on the amount of sedimentation.
25:24
For example, if you had a little upgrade in a tractor trail, you
25:29
would leave the sediment behind.
25:30
And so on.
25:31
And the worst thing is to lead everything down into a landing.
25:36
Yeah.
25:36
So, we found that the same thing applies to high-lead logging.
25:44
We designed our sales to get the very large portion of it to be uphill
25:50
yarding, because then the trails fanned out and there were sediment barriers.
25:57
Any sediment would usually be caught in the vegetation.
26:04
The roads, of course, would always remain a problem, and we
26:10
spent a lot of time designing, trying to put our roads in locations where
26:14
they would be a minimum of sloughing
26:23
and soil movement, if we could.
26:24
Hmm.
26:24
We spent a lot of time looking for good road locations.
26:27
It probably shows in the upkeep of those roads in the Andrews.
26:32
Even in this steep country, they should have held up pretty well.
26:38
Mike Kerrick and Ed Anderson mentioned something about an
26:44
initial proposal for a ladder-type road system that was abandoned.
26:49
Is that something that you were involved in?
26:53
Well, they tack names onto these things, so I don’t know.
26:55
I wasn't sure what they were referring to.
26:57
I just thought I'd ask you.
27:00
I did
27:03
put out an article on what constituted the most efficient road
27:06
system for a Douglas-fir drainage.
27:09
I was saying there that the inefficiencies came from the
27:14
roads that are climbing roads.
27:17
Roads
27:19
that were essentially level would give you the most efficient road
27:27
network.
27:28
Most of the early roads that were put into the National
27:32
Forest System just climbed up.
27:36
Yeah.
27:36
One after the other, they just climbed up.
27:38
Every time they hit a new drainage, you can go from one or another.
27:44
So, what you were putting on the Andrews was something different?
27:48
Yeah, they were different.
27:49
It was essentially based on this idea having a minimum of climbing
27:53
roads and a maximum of level roads.
27:56
Did you see anybody else trying that?
27:59
Oh, I think it was known for a long time before I got it into publication, because
28:05
I looked at some of the old air photos and noted the most efficient logging systems.
28:12
Okay.
28:12
You were basing it on what you'd seen in practice and elsewhere on the forest?
28:15
Sure.
28:15
But for the Andrews you were able to pretty much call the shots?
28:19
Yes, since I was designing all the roads.
28:21
I put them where I wanted and, of course, the roads are determined
28:27
entirely by the topography.
28:29
Avoid the steep parts if you can.
28:32
Let me back up
28:36
here for just a minute.
28:36
You mentioned that you were responsible for getting out
28:37
20 million board feet a year.
28:39
That was essentially given to you as a responsibility.
28:42
Was that because the experimental forest was considered part of
28:47
the Willamette National Forest?
28:48
Well, the Andrews Experimental Forest was carved out of the Willamette National
28:53
Forest and Supervisor [J.R.] Bruckart was very careful about his cut [logging
28:58
numbers] . He wanted to be the number one in the National Forest System.
29:01
Okay.
29:01
I see.
29:02
And he didn't want any area taken out, so they compromised once
29:07
in a while: We’ll cut 30 million feet for the next couple of years.
29:10
So there was an end to that.
29:13
Yeah, there was an end to it.
29:14
Okay.
29:14
So, there was kind of a phase out period?
29:17
Yeah, that was way more than the
29:22
sustained annual yield, but all the forests were doing that at the time,
29:26
to get the road systems put in.
29:30
With the intention of being normalized later.
29:34
So, the purpose was to cover every region and to cut?
29:37
Yeah.
29:37
The saying was that, “We're cutting the best to pay for the roads.”
29:42
So,
29:45
the goal was to put the roads in.
29:46
Yeah.
29:47
It was to get the roads attached.
29:48
And that was very expensive.
29:50
Sure.
29:50
And I guess it still
29:56
is.
29:56
Can you think of any particular logistical problems you encountered
29:57
trying to put those roads in?
29:58
You were talking about the sedimentation issue, and
30:04
you were trying to avoid the traditional climbing road systems.
30:08
But in terms of just the topography of the Andrews.
30:10
Well, there was a lot of good topography on the Andrews.
30:13
There was a lot of very rough topography, too.
30:17
It’s a matter of trying to locate landings and get roads through to them.
30:24
The rough parts were, of course, the
30:30
problems.
30:31
Every year we took them another few square miles, and planned the entire
30:37
logging plan for us, so we had to take the problems as they came.
30:44
Was there a master plan for
30:49
the whole forest?
30:50
No.
30:52
It didn't start out with a master plan for the whole forest, because, for
30:55
one thing, we didn't have a good map.
30:56
Yeah.
30:57
By the time we had a good map, we were already into the second sale.
31:02
The opening of the narrow area at the bottom was all done, and so, we were
31:08
extending out into the rest of it.
31:10
Going back to your perceptions of the purpose of the experimental forest at
31:17
the time you started, initially, your responsibility was managing timber
31:21
sales, but as people came in, and consulted with you, your ideas changed on
31:27
that.
31:28
I think we pretty well figured out what happens in later
31:32
stages of old-growth management, though not in a scientific way.
31:36
Uh-huh.
31:38
Whether the old growth just kind of disappears and other
31:40
things come in afterwards.
31:42
One
31:44
of the surprising things that happened was it suddenly dawned on me that the
31:51
character of hemlock, as well as fir, was
31:56
largely determined by fire.
31:58
A fire that had burned about a hundred years ago on the Andrews
32:05
had left a hundred-year, old-second growth on the main ridges,
32:12
then, the old growth was below.
32:13
As I began to study that, I could see
32:17
what was happening was that these fires were not
32:23
fires that made a conflagration out of the whole forest, but the stand
32:30
in the bottoms was almost intact.
32:34
As you went up steeper hills, fires crowned and killed the trees,
32:40
killed them all on the top of
32:44
ridges.
32:45
Yeah.
32:46
When we were camping out in some of those areas, I had time to
32:50
really look at the stand histories.
32:53
I could see that,
32:56
as the number of killed trees dropped from 100 percent to 80, to 60, to
33:04
40, and so on, the proportion of Douglas-fir to hemlock changed.
33:13
For example, at the 50/50 point, that was when there were about 10 old Douglas-firs
33:19
per acre left, half-and-half with hemlock.
33:23
Hmm.
33:23
Generally, those were very nice stands of competing Douglas-fir and hemlock.
33:29
Then downhill from that, you
33:34
found more and more and more hemlock, until you got nothing but hemlock.
33:37
And finally, where it was shaded enough, you had these umbrella type
33:40
of hemlock, not good hemlock at all.
33:44
So, fire was determining the amount of hemlock as well as the amount of fir.
33:49
As you realized those kinds of relations involved there, did that begin to
33:54
affect the way you designed – [roads
34:00
and sales]
34:00
? I just figured that we wanted as high a proportion of fir back
34:04
into the forest as we could get.
34:06
Essentially, we were saying we ought to have clear-cutting.
34:11
I did have some shade-tree cuttings intended to provide shade
34:17
to keep the hot lethal surface temperatures from climbing too high.
34:21
Uh-huh.
34:22
I had been doing studies on lethal surface temperatures up there as well.
34:26
Studies I did were primarily regeneration studies.
34:29
Okay.
34:31
I was able to at least determine for my own satisfaction that most
34:37
of the problem was heat injury.
34:42
[Leo] Isaac had found that out, but I simply confirmed that most
34:46
of the losses of germinating seedlings was just from heat.
34:47
Uh-huh.
34:53
And I set up a sampling system with temperature pellets for each
34:59
clear-cut where I'd try to estimate the problems from heat by how many of
35:04
them exceeded a certain temperature when I put them off in a grid.
35:12
It was greatly varied, but it turned out that when I sampled the natural
35:19
regeneration, it was highly correlated with the temperature pellets.
35:23
Hmm.
35:26
At least for the years I was there.
35:28
I had that in my thesis at Oregon State.
35:30
My thesis was done on lethal surface temperatures.
35:36
After you worked at the Andrews, you came to OSU to finish your thesis based on
35:41
the work you did there on?
35:49
I was asked to come down here and set up the program in forest genetics.
35:56
Uh-huh.
35:59
I became head of the “Genetics Project” here [Forest Sciences
36:04
Laboratory in Corvallis] in 1954.
36:04
The Andrews was being phased out anyway.
36:08
It was being phased by the Forest Service?
36:09
Well, it was being phased out.
36:13
They were not going to have a permanent person there, and they
36:17
didn't for a whole year or so.
36:19
Then Jack Rothacher came down, and I guess he was there most of the time after that.
36:24
There was a time when the district took over activity on the forest after I left.
36:32
Did you work very closely with the district after you left?
36:35
No.
36:35
I was busy with genetics down here,
36:43
then he came, and so, I didn't go back there.
36:45
So when the station was in control of the experimental forest, the people were the
36:49
same as those that were working there when you were involved directly, is that right?
36:52
No, that was an entirely new group.
36:55
They were entirely watershed management.
36:59
Sort of the changing of the guards.
37:01
The timber management program was completely phased out.
37:07
Your closest colleagues in '48 to
37:13
'54 would be people like Jack Rothacher?
37:14
No, he came down there later.
37:15
Okay.
37:18
We didn't have any overlap at all.
37:19
It was a year break, then he came in.
37:21
So, I just knew him.
37:25
So
37:28
people like Wustenberg and Gashwiler would be people you primarily worked with?
37:30
Yes.
37:30
And the district people,
37:33
Brit Ash and his crew.
37:37
He was a ranger at McKenzie Bridge.
37:40
Okay.
37:40
They didn't have a Blue River Station at that time.
37:43
It was just McKenzie Bridge.
37:44
Now, when you were laying out these sales, as Mike Kerrick and Ed Anderson were
37:51
talking together about, what apparently
37:53
-- Mike
37:56
came there one summer and worked on….I forget just what
37:59
project he was working on.
38:00
Fire control or something.
38:01
Yeah.
38:01
I think so.
38:01
He was just a student at the time.
38:03
So, you remember that?
38:04
Oh, yes.
38:05
Of course.
38:06
[Laughter]
38:06
There probably weren't a lot of people up there at that time.
38:07
Oh no.
38:08
It was just the C.C.C. camp, and we all lived together in a cook house.
38:13
That might be something to talk about a little bit, the kinds of facilities.
38:16
When you first went up there, there were no roads?
38:17
No.
38:17
I hauled a little 12-foot trailer up there.
38:21
That is what I lived in during the summers and into the fall.
38:24
Was that located about where the headquarters are now?
38:26
No.
38:27
It was located where the McKenzie River Station is now.
38:30
It used to be where the CCC camp was [1930s and 1940s]
38:31
. So, you lived out of that trailer, and then you hiked back
38:36
where you were doing your sites?
38:37
Yes.
38:40
My lifestyle was really kind of interesting, because I was a bachelor.
38:43
Uh-huh.
38:44
I found a family in the community that was interested in the money that would
38:52
come from serving me breakfast and supper.
38:56
So, I would eat my meals with them, and fish in the evenings.
39:02
It was very interesting in that I had a tough time getting out
39:07
in the summertime, because every weekend seemed to be scheduled with
39:12
people who would like to visit me.
39:15
[Laughter]
39:18
What do you suppose was the attraction?
39:19
[Laughter]
39:20
Oh, naturally, I was the attraction.
39:22
[Laughter] Well, that was kind of fun.
39:26
You mentioned last time that you thought some people were
39:28
attracted out there by poker games?
39:30
Oh, yes.
39:30
We had poker games out there in the trailer.
39:33
I had numerous Washington office visitors wanting to see this wonderful
39:40
work that was going on in the Andrews Experimental Forest, as long as it
39:44
involved a chance to fish and play poker.
39:46
You found yourself giving a lot of tours?
39:49
Oh sure.
39:50
Of course.
39:50
All the time, tours.
39:53
So, recreational use of the forest was a personal
39:57
-- Not the forest; the McKenzie River was the attraction.
40:02
Okay.
40:03
You didn’t take them back up in the forest?
40:05
Always took them back up in the forest.
40:06
But then, fish in Lookout Creek as an incidental thing, but most of
40:10
the fishing was on the McKenzie.
40:11
Okay.
40:13
You mentioned there were communities where you were able to
40:18
get invitations for dinner.
40:20
You
40:22
said earlier that you would
40:28
get invitations from local families.
40:30
Well, sure.
40:31
I got
40:34
plenty of invitations from the community.
40:34
What kinds of people in the community were you involved with?
40:36
Was this a logging community?
40:37
It was as much recreation as logging.
40:41
They were making their money off of recreation as much as logging
40:44
at the time, and so it was kind of split between those two groups.
40:48
And it was kind of interesting, because they were all waiting for
40:52
when school started, and particularly when the roads closed over the pass.
41:01
Then the social season started.
41:03
Everybody visited everybody else and they had these very
41:10
classy home dinners, where you might go and there would be name tags for you
41:15
at the table and that sort of thing.
41:17
It was fairly formal.
41:19
Oh yeah, sometimes.
41:20
Of
41:22
course, everything centered around the schools.
41:25
I mean, they had football teams that were highly competitive.
41:31
So, the public connection between the local community and the forests, as
41:36
represented by you, was pretty close?
41:37
Of course.
41:39
We were just one of the community.
41:41
Did you have a sense of people in the community had an understanding
41:44
what you were doing up there?
41:45
Oh, it was vague.
41:48
It was vague.
41:50
It really wasn't a timber community at that time.
41:52
It was more
41:52
-- It was about half-and-half.
41:53
It was, you know, most of people were
41:56
- - Were loggers?
41:57
Yeah, about as many logging families as recreation-oriented families.
42:03
When you think about the situation up there between 1948 and 1954, did you see
42:07
any major changes in the kind of reaction of the community, or just your role?
42:11
Well, I don't get up there very much anymore.
42:14
All I can say is that these communities were very sophisticated for the times.
42:19
Things were going on that also were
42:24
going on downtown.
42:26
It's just that some things were rather primitive, too.
42:32
Such as?
42:34
Let's
42:36
see, a bunch of outhouses.
42:40
I
42:43
wondered if people were sometimes a little slow in establishing water
42:49
systems and septic tanks and so on.
42:54
The community itself didn't change so much between '48 and '54?
42:55
Oh, no.
42:55
Pretty much the same.
42:56
The same.
42:57
But the Andrews changed quite a bit in that period of time?
43:00
Oh, yes.
43:02
By '54, I was in sale planning.
43:05
That was quite a ways up the drainage.
43:07
I was selling timber almost to
43:20
the head of McRae Creek, to the head of Mack Creek.
43:23
Everything else was much the same way out on the drainage by '54.
43:26
Only corners left.
43:30
There wasn't much had been basically brought into the infrastructure?
43:34
That I didn't know, a very personal thing.
43:38
Were there any areas that you didn’t know?
43:39
Actually, I knew something about almost every acre out there.
43:42
So on your hikes, you spent a lot of time out there?
43:43
Oh, yes.
43:44
In a timber sale you really cover it all.
43:47
You have to look at everything.
43:49
I think you mentioned last time you'd camp out there Monday through Friday?
43:52
Yes.
43:52
Our typical week was to go out Monday mornings.
43:57
Pack all the way up to the falls, walk across the canyons down
44:03
low, with a pack on our back with everything we needed for the week.
44:06
Then, we’d set up our 9 x12 silkolene fly, rolled out our sleeping bags, took
44:16
our food down to the creek, and put rocks on top of what little stuck up
44:23
above, so the bears wouldn't get into it.
44:25
All right.
44:27
You put that underwater then.
44:28
Yeah.
44:29
In big pots.
44:31
I was going to ask you about that.
44:32
Did you feel comfortable out in the forest?
44:36
I never felt uncomfortable out there.
44:37
The only thing that was out there could be bear, but
44:43
we hardly ever saw 'em, you know.
44:44
If they saw us, they let us know where they were going.
44:48
It's interesting, up in Alaska they had this bear attack.
44:53
That's a different kind of bear.
44:54
Sure.
44:55
I was just curious.
44:56
Did you institute a policy where you ever felt you wanted to carry a rifle?
45:00
No, timber sale people down here never carried anything except
45:04
for recreational shooting.
45:06
Yeah.
45:06
It's nice and relaxing and
45:07
-- It was just extra weight.
45:10
That's actually the way people up in Alaska talked, too.
45:12
They didn’t want to carry it, but they had to because of regulations.
45:14
Oh, yeah.
45:15
You go up there and they carry around real rifles.
45:18
You could drop a dime down the barrel!
45:21
[Laughter]
45:22
Yes, there would be pretty harrowing experiences.
45:25
You bet.
45:26
I’ve gone out with them, and if you look and see them shaking this rifle again, you
45:36
don't want to be around.
45:40
[Related Jim
45:43
LaBau’s story about being surprised by a bear in dense woods, and having
45:47
been unable to draw a bead on the bear,
45:52
because
45:56
he couldn’t see the end of the rifle]
45:56
He was lucky, because I had just talked to a friend yesterday who was up in
46:05
Alaska, and she got into a bear attack.
46:07
She was working for the BLM, and she's still recovering from it.
46:11
Oh, no.
46:12
Yeah, I'm glad we didn't have that.
46:15
Yeah.
46:15
But you didn't have
46:15
- No, we didn't have that.
46:16
Sounds like a pretty enjoyable time out there, actually.
46:18
Well, yeah, you could say I had some of the best days of my life up there.
46:22
You mentioned last time, that there was kind of an
46:23
emotional attachment you had for
46:25
the place?
46:26
[H.J. Andrews]
46:27
Oh sure.
46:28
You love the place.
46:29
What about the place that struck you as unusual compared
46:33
to other areas you had worked?
46:34
Well, I don't know.
46:39
It was just untouched.
46:41
Almost all the areas in the Cascades had been
46:47
traveled by many people before, but here, I felt I was the first
46:49
one going into a wild area.
46:52
You mentioned last time you had this sense of stewardship for the place,
46:56
and that you had a guiding philosophy?
47:01
My philosophy was that we should harvest with the minimum impact on the resource.
47:08
Uh-huh.
47:10
When I had visitors up there, I felt that keeping it natural
47:14
was what I was trying to do.
47:16
I was trying to keep the sediment down, keep people out of leave areas,
47:24
and the leave areas were going to be leave areas, and not have
47:28
continuous entries into them.
47:32
Try to do the least damage possible putting in the road system, do
47:37
the least damage to the streams.
47:39
We really worked at that when we would install a little larger
47:44
culvert, as we would have all the debris removed with tractor cables,
47:52
so we'd get them out of the way.
47:59
If we had to put a tractor pass through there to get a really good
48:02
bed, it was very carefully done.
48:05
Immediately, we would channel the water through to cut down on sediment,
48:11
and they would lay the culvert in.
48:14
Meanwhile, we would have a bypass for the water.
48:20
We bypassed that some way with a culvert or another method.
48:25
We worked in the dry bed, then laid the culvert on the
48:27
dry, and then covered it over.
48:29
Then, finally, send the water through the culvert.
48:32
Very, very controlled sedimentation.
48:35
There was always sedimentation, but it was very controlled.
48:39
Don Wustenberg showed me, on the Sale #1 watershed creek, we
48:44
practically wiped out everything.
48:46
From Sale #2 on, he said we didn't, as far as he was concerned,
48:50
we didn't wipe out a fish.
48:51
Huh.
48:52
It was that effective.
48:53
It
48:56
sounds from what you’re saying, that your sense of what the resource was
48:59
that you were “trying to do least damage.” It was not just timber, but
49:03
you're talking about the watershed.
49:05
Yeah, the watershed, sure.
49:06
And the remaining years for that 400-year-old stand.
49:15
You mentioned earlier, you were in contact with Bob Ruth at Cascade Head.
49:19
Is this something you see as typical in most experimental forests of that period?
49:22
Well, there weren't very many people like that.
49:25
Bob Ruth didn't worry about that at [Laughter] Cascade Head.
49:27
No.
49:27
Okay.
49:28
No.
49:29
I don't think it was.
49:39
Another thing I succeeded with in a really strange way, was that I had come to the
49:48
conclusion about Sale #2, that we were
49:54
putting a cutting line around the best of the timber.
49:58
This old growth was in various stages of preservation.
50:04
The best preserved was going to stay the best preserved, and the poorest
50:10
was deteriorating the fastest, so some areas that were 400 years old, were
50:17
virtually brush patches out there.
50:19
That deteriorates fast.
50:20
Generally, they had root fungus in them, so
50:31
I began to lay out the sales with cutting boundaries according to the
50:37
department policy, for fire purposes.
50:39
I
50:41
could classify those units according to how much deterioration there was,
50:46
and I made sure that I put the most deteriorated ones into the first sales.
50:51
Uh-huh.
50:52
Well,
50:57
the cruises were all done by the Willamette National Forest.
51:00
The
51:03
man that did the cruising came out there one day and said, "You know, that
51:08
was the damnedest country to cruise." He said, "It was just so darn brushy.
51:16
What's going on?" "Well," I said, "I guess I'll have to level with you, and
51:19
this is what I'm doing." Explained this.
51:22
I thought, well, I'll hear from the higher-ups about this.
51:27
Raising the cost of cruising those areas, and next thing, here was a man from
51:35
the Willamette National Forest office, who said, "We're changing our policy on
51:40
choosing the cutting sites. Henceforth, we will put the most deteriorated
51:46
old-growth into the cutting units.”
51:50
So, they adopted your policy?
51:51
I sold him on it!
51:53
Uh-huh.
51:53
Well, if you looked around, you could see the same thing, because the ones
51:57
that were deteriorating the fastest were the ones that were already kind of open.
52:03
Your theory was, you go in and clear that out, and you get a
52:03
young, productive stand going?
52:04
Yeah, you get a new start on it.
52:07
Sure.
52:08
Okay.
52:08
Hoping that you can do something with the new growth.
52:11
I don't know what they can do, but at least that was the idea.
52:13
Now, on the other end of the scale, I knew that we were going to be cutting in this
52:18
area for at least a hundred years more.
52:23
If they stayed on sustained-yield, it would be about a
52:26
100-year rotation in there.
52:28
And, to assure that these stands would still be pretty intact a hundred
52:34
years from now, we figured we're going have to have the best ones out there.
52:40
You were looking at the long-term?
52:41
Of course.
52:43
But, that was normal.
52:45
Everybody figured on making the rotation.
52:46
You
52:51
know?
52:51
The indirect result of that was that some of the less deteriorated
52:55
old-growth was not cut?
52:58
I think on the Willamette Forest, the better-preserved areas actually got left.
53:05
It sounds like policy changes from this one person
53:12
who came out and had wide impacts.
53:12
Yes.
53:12
I thought I’d catch hell for it, really.
53:15
It changes your outlook on what they were doing.
53:18
Basically, you just sold him on the idea.
53:19
Do you know who that was?
53:21
Yeah.
53:21
That was Alan Weinard.
53:22
Al?
53:23
Al Weinard.
53:23
Yeah.
53:23
He went to the Washington office
53:28
[U.S. Forest Service] after that.
53:28
He
53:28
was
53:32
sort of second under Supervisor Bruckart, as far as the timber
53:36
management side was concerned.
53:38
So the initial shift came at the district level?
53:44
No, it came at the Willamette Forest level.
53:46
It was a memo from the Willamette Forest, not from the districts.
53:49
It
53:52
was one of those things that you didn't even need to make a publication about.
53:55
It sounds like
53:58
you weren't actually out there trying to change policy, it just kind of happened.
54:02
No.
54:02
In fact, it got to where there were enough problems with criticisms
54:07
from the Willamette National Forest, primarily because it was costing
54:09
more to do this kind of sale layout.
54:12
Criticism was such that the less they knew, the better.
54:18
What was your perception at that time about your region?
54:22
Well, they were gung-ho for “getting the cut out,” particularly the Willamette
54:27
National Forest, because they were competing with the Olympic [National
54:30
Forest] for the number one spot in the country as far as timber sales receipts.
54:39
Did you have a sense of how they perceived research or how they perceived your role?
54:44
I don't think they liked my role, because for one thing,
54:46
the engineers didn't like it.
54:48
I was always complaining that these road standards were
54:51
forcing us to do dumb things.
54:56
Then they came back and said, "If you don't lay them out to our standards,
54:58
then we won't maintain them."
55:05
What I wanted to do was to reduce the standards on the roads as you
55:09
got further and further from the main roads, because as you reduce standards
55:14
you could fit the topography better.
55:17
You could have sharper curves, less sight [shorter line of sight] , narrower roads.
55:22
First order was a 12-foot roadbed and a 3-foot ditch.
55:27
By the time you followed their standard, the wheel of the truck near
55:32
the bank was 9 feet from the first dirt that [laughter] was in powder
55:40
if you went straight out from that.
55:42
To me, that 9 feet was very important, because sometimes it went way up the
55:47
hill, trying to get to the top of the cut.
55:51
Their standards were designed more for the safety of timber operations than
55:56
it was for the health of the forest.
55:59
I don't know.
56:00
I don't know what their standards were actually trying to accomplish, because
56:06
they had all kinds of different effects.
56:10
It
56:13
sounds like your perception was that your job there was to challenge
56:20
what they were already doing.
56:21
No.
56:23
I challenged it without knowing whether I should or not.
56:27
I said, "My gosh, if I'm going to improve sale layouts and do it with minimum
56:33
impact, these standards are in the way."
56:37
And what would you say was their reaction?
56:39
They said, "Okay, if you don't want to use our standards,
56:41
we won't maintain the roads."
56:43
Not cooperative?
56:43
No, there was just no argument
56:48
there.
56:50
Think in terms of the education or the knowledge of forestry of the managers.
57:02
How would you evaluate that at that time in the 1950's?
57:05
Well, they were all graduates of forestry school, good people, it’s
57:06
just that they had different goals.
57:08
I'll give them that.
57:09
They were smart people.
57:10
People aren't any dumber.
57:15
One
57:44
thing about the watersheds that I was very proud of, is that I finally figured
57:48
out a way to reduce stream sedimentation
57:54
and handle the logging right-of-way, at the same time.
57:58
That was that when the waterway was felled, or before the
58:01
right-of-way was felled,
58:09
I would have them take a tractor and make a
58:16
barely passable road at the top of the cut, as you went through.
58:21
That was all engineered in.
58:24
We would hoof it down ‘til we came to a stream.
58:27
This road would allow them to remove the timber with these
58:36
kind of self-loading loggers.
58:39
When they got to the stream, the tractor could pull all the logs out of the
58:44
stream, and have a cleared area there.
58:50
The first thing that would be done would be installation of the culvert
58:55
and making the fill for the stream.
58:58
Then, the rest of the logging road was built, that would not involve
59:05
the stream in the logging phase.
59:07
It would be logging across the stream.
59:09
If there was anything that went across the stream, it would
59:11
be on the top of this fill.
59:13
Boy, when I could get them to do that, it sure eliminated the
59:15
major problems of sedimentation.
59:15
When you could get them to do it?
59:21
When I could get them to do it.
59:22
Was it hard getting them to do that?
59:24
Yeah.
59:25
What was the hurdle there?
59:27
The timber sale agreement.
59:30
The contract.
59:31
Have to get a special thing into a contract on the agreement, that
59:35
it was an experimental forest.
59:38
So, the barrier there would be management at the forest level.
59:40
Yeah, I thought it would catch on, but it didn't, really.
59:43
But I had it done experimentally a couple of times.
59:46
In interviews with Kerrick and [Ed] Anderson, they said
59:48
clear-cuts of different sizes were laid out, to experiment with
59:48
clear-cuts ranging from about
59:58
1/8 of
1:00:04
an acre up to about 320 acres.
1:00:06
Who was doing this?
1:00:08
That's what I was going to ask, if that was you or was that after your time?
1:00:11
Well, I did some cuttings
1:00:14
set up
1:00:18
to work on the problem of lethal surface temperatures.
1:00:23
One of them was a series of north/south clear cuts that were
1:00:30
200 feet and 400 feet wide, to see how they regenerated.
1:00:35
They all regenerated.
1:00:40
That was never a problem.
1:00:40
Then the other kind were large clear cuts on fairly good topography, where
1:00:44
I could leave lines of trees, which I called my shade seed tree system.
1:00:51
That was composed of lines of trees about 180 feet apart, just far
1:00:56
enough so the tops of the trees would pass some shade over the ground.
1:01:00
I tried to limit the amount of exposure to about four hours of
1:01:08
full sunlight, and tried to have some shade passing over the area.
1:01:13
At least every four hours.
1:01:14
Uh-huh.
1:01:14
Those regenerated easily, too.
1:01:19
Larger clear-cuts were much slower on regenerating.
1:01:28
They were on the Andrews Experimental Forest when I left.
1:01:31
Jerry Franklin looked into the regeneration reporting on them.
1:01:39
Were you working at all with Franklin at that time?
1:01:40
No, Jerry came in
1:01:44
with the watershed, the next phase.
1:01:47
He was there, but we didn't have much contact.
1:01:51
That district ranger you were working with at that time was Bob Mealey.
1:01:54
Is that right?
1:01:54
No, Brit Ash was there through my whole career.
1:01:59
Brit Ash.
1:02:00
He went to Alaska after
1:02:05
we finished.
1:02:05
Okay.
1:02:05
Was he the person you worked with most on actually laying out the cuts and roads?
1:02:10
Well, no.
1:02:11
His crew was involved with administering the sales.
1:02:15
So,
1:02:22
the different size clear-cut studies, are something that came up later?
1:02:28
Oh, I think there were several studies in the region on
1:02:31
different sizes of clear-cuts.
1:02:32
I'm trying to learn from old-timers, who were saying the logger, Mike
1:02:38
Savelich, was complaining about some of the different cut block sizes?
1:02:41
Well, yeah, [laughs] he complained about whatever he could.
1:02:45
Sounds like quite a character.
1:02:46
[Laughing] If he thought he could get some more timber or something
1:02:50
out of it, it made him happy.
1:02:52
When you said, "Well, I think you could cut this little patch
1:02:55
of timber in addition to your sale." That made him happy.
1:02:59
If you can't take any out, that made him unhappy.
1:03:01
And, if you raised any costs, that made him unhappy.
1:03:04
The thing that he was complaining about the most was timber sales
1:03:11
that required him to fell the trees within a very small unit.
1:03:13
He was having a lot of time spent on those.
1:03:16
Well, sure.
1:03:18
He took the contract on why should a guy complain after he okayed the contract?
1:03:25
[Laughing]
1:03:25
I liked your comment about how he complained about placement of roads.
1:03:27
You mentioned last time that PNW Station Director Bob Aufderheide was there for
1:03:32
the
1:03:38
early logging studies.
1:03:39
Well, Bob wasn’t Director of the Experiment Station, he was the head of
1:03:43
the Willamette Research Center [Corvallis]
1:03:45
. Okay.
1:03:48
Which was stationed in Corvallis.
1:03:50
Phil Briegleb was the station director [PNW] at the time.
1:03:54
You mentioned something else about Phil Briegleb, that he came out
1:03:58
during the timber survey [Survey of the Douglas Fir Region, led
1:04:00
by H.J. Andrews and R.C. Cowlin]
1:04:00
. Oh, yeah!
1:04:01
It was important in the history of the forest that he
1:04:11
did the legwork on the survey of the region.
1:04:15
He told me one time he was walking the trail down the ridge that
1:04:22
goes past Carpenter Mountain and comes out at Lookout Mountain.
1:04:26
When he got to the head of that drainage, he said, "If I ever
1:04:29
want an experimental forest in old growth, this would be it.” And he did
1:04:39
it.
1:04:39
Was it H.J. Andrews who was partially responsible for setting up the forest.
1:04:41
Is that right?
1:04:42
No, H.J. Andrews had no role in it at all.
1:04:44
Okay.
1:04:44
H. J. Andrews, the reason that he
1:04:50
had prominence enough to be used for the naming of the forest [in memoriam]
1:04:55
, he was killed in an auto accident in Washington D.C.,
1:05:00
and he was there looking over housing, because he was going to be the
1:05:04
next chief of the Forest Service.
1:05:06
Is that right?
1:05:06
Yes.
1:05:07
That's a little detail that should be known, and that he was quite
1:05:12
a person, and good enough to be considered for the next chief.
1:05:17
So, that was in the works.
1:05:21
He was actually looking for a house to move into?
1:05:22
Yeah, and
1:05:28
he would have made a great chief.
1:05:31
[Respected in public and private sector]
1:05:32
Have you ever worked with him at all?
1:05:33
No.
1:05:34
I didn't.
1:05:36
He visited the experimental forest a couple of times and played poker.
1:05:45
Where was Phil Briegleb at that time?
1:05:47
He was director of the experiment station and
1:05:53
was, as far as I was concerned, the main guy setting up the Andrews
1:05:58
Experimental Forest [Blue River E.F., 1948-53] , and accepting this
1:06:01
20-million-foot cut to get in, that
1:06:05
sort of thing.
1:06:06
In terms of selecting the site, and working with the forest?
1:06:09
Making it happen.
1:06:10
He was probably the main one there, although I don't know
1:06:13
what the records show, you
1:06:18
know, what the written records will show.
1:06:19
I'm sure that he had that in mind and was going to make it happen, if he could.
1:06:24
And he was in a position to be approving it.
1:06:29
Was he in charge when the name was changed from Blue River to Andrews?
1:06:34
Yeah.
1:06:37
Was there any connection between him and Andrews?
1:06:42
They were well-acquainted.
1:06:44
They were kind of from the same era.
1:06:45
Sure.
1:06:46
Okay.
1:06:48
I'm sure they thought a lot of each other.
1:06:51
They were both very high-caliber people.
1:06:59
It sounds like you and Briegleb spent a lot of time together?
1:07:03
Yeah,
1:07:07
I used to go skiing with him and his family.
1:07:09
In fact, they took care of my dog when I spent three months
1:07:12
in Washington D.C. one time.
1:07:15
So, where did he go from the station after being director?
1:07:21
Did he retire?
1:07:21
No, I think he
1:07:27
went to the Southern Experimental Station, which was a bigger job.
1:07:36
What did you do after the Andrews?
1:07:38
I know you came up to OSU here?
1:07:40
Well, let's see, I was set up as project leader for the genetics project in 1954.
1:07:47
That's what I did next.
1:07:48
And that's what I've done since.
1:07:51
That's a continuous line from that point on, and as you mentioned
1:07:54
earlier, you haven’t had a great deal of involvement in what's been
1:07:55
going on in the Andrews since then.
1:07:55
No.
1:07:59
I've just chopped it off.
1:08:01
I haven't had any involvement with the Andrews.
1:08:03
Well, how about with people that work there?
1:08:05
No.
1:08:05
None at all?
1:08:07
No.
1:08:07
Is that hard?
1:08:08
Because you mentioned that last time.
1:08:09
No, it wasn't hard.
1:08:10
Like I said, I was in love with the place and I didn't ever want to go back.
1:08:17
You were in love with the place, but you didn't want to go back?
1:08:19
No, I didn't want to
1:08:22
see what happened.
1:08:23
Is that right?
1:08:23
The reason, the district took it over, so I knew
1:08:29
everything I
1:08:33
worked on would be in limbo.
1:08:37
That was only for a short period, wasn't it?
1:08:38
Well,
1:08:40
they put some watershed people back on to it, but the big effort in timber
1:08:47
management, that whole thing was gone.
1:08:51
Gone.
1:08:52
So, just too painful to go back and see?
1:08:55
No, I don't think it would painful.
1:08:56
I just didn't want to do it.
1:08:57
[Laughter]
1:08:59
No, I've been out there since, but not in
1:09:04
any [official] role.
1:09:05
When you went back up there, were your fears confirmed about that?
1:09:08
No, it looked pretty good.
1:09:09
The road system’s still there?
1:09:12
Well, you can't take the road system out now.
1:09:14
That had kind of a long-lasting impact.
1:09:18
The cutting units are regenerating
1:09:22
very well.
1:09:22
They’re almost
1:09:25
the size of timber you can cut.
1:09:26
Mike [Kerrick] and Ed [Anderson] were talking about this
1:09:40
person you also mentioned earlier, Mike Savelich.
1:09:43
And they made quite a point about his use of all Croatian crews.
1:09:49
Well, he still spoke broken Yugoslavian, and of course, these people, in
1:09:58
self-defense, helped each other.
1:10:04
He was looking for Yugoslavians.
1:10:06
I think they all did that.
1:10:08
Okay.
1:10:08
No, they all did, because
1:10:12
most anybody could go out there and get a job.
1:10:19
The people I had contact with weren’t Yugoslavians.
1:10:23
I mean to say that his management team was
1:10:32
not Yugoslavian.
1:10:35
My management
1:10:38
was Yugoslavian now.
1:10:38
I'm trying to get a handle on the level of involvement of the local community
1:10:45
and the administration of the Andrews.
1:10:47
Were people in that local community that you were involved with in the
1:10:50
social circuit, involved directly in operations on the Andrews?
1:10:55
They didn't even know what was going on.
1:10:57
In fact, the only thing that was going on was my crew.
1:11:01
That was all.
1:11:01
How many people were up there?
1:11:02
Well, Hank Gratkowski was there
1:11:08
most of the time.
1:11:11
He was there permanently with me all year, and he was just an assistant.
1:11:19
That's all.
1:11:20
He left to take over work down in the Umpqua area.
1:11:26
He and I were it, and then we got summertime help.
1:11:31
That's all.
1:11:33
Lots of times, it was just he and I. That was the whole staff.
1:11:37
For most of the year.
1:11:38
That's all.
1:11:39
We would lay out 20 million feet a year and did the research,
1:11:42
whatever research was there.
1:11:46
What was his background before he started working for you?
1:11:49
Do you recall?
1:11:50
Well, he was just a graduate forester.
1:11:53
Applied for work at the experiment station.
1:11:56
Where did he study?
1:12:03
Gosh, I don't remember.
1:12:03
I was just curious.
1:12:04
He's not around anymore, is he?
1:12:06
I don't even know that.
1:12:07
He was having all kinds of health problems though his career and he
1:12:12
finally retired in the Roseburg area.
1:12:18
Gosh, I haven't heard in the last five years what his status was.
1:12:21
I'd be interested in talking to him.
1:12:21
One of the things I’d like to get a handle on is
1:12:26
some of the people who were here.
1:12:32
You might be able to find him through the station’s personnel people.
1:12:37
Have them look up records for him.
1:12:40
I'm sure he retired under the
1:12:46
Office of Personnel Management
1:13:03
in Washington D.C.
1:13:04
Are there issues you think you ought to address?
1:13:10
Things that strike you about the Andrews?
1:13:12
No.
1:13:13
Things that I would have a contribution to are in the past.
1:13:18
Like I say, I don't think forestry is the same anymore.
1:13:20
I wouldn't even know how to tackle
1:13:25
“new forestry.” [Alternative methods to “industrial forestry”
1:13:26
being developed/advanced by Jerry Franklin at that time.]
1:13:26
There is one thing that struck me.
1:13:28
I'm trying to find in my notes where it’s located.
1:13:32
One issue that came up in earlier interviews was the concern over
1:13:39
an example of how research on the Andrews influenced an early
1:13:45
environmental concern in the 1950's.
1:13:47
Yeah, we had groups in Eugene you might say were the ones that finally
1:13:52
became the environmental groups, and they visited the experimental forests
1:13:57
just as field trips.
1:13:59
I
1:14:03
told them exactly what I was doing.
1:14:06
They seemed to think that this was a good approach.
1:14:08
They really didn't at the time have
1:14:13
any thought that logging shouldn’t be done.
1:14:18
I didn't see that, that coming out.
1:14:21
It’s just whether it was done with care, or just without care.
1:14:27
They mentioned that University of Oregon Professor Karl...I
1:14:30
can't actually read my notes on
1:14:35
this, but it’s……Karl [Onthank?]
1:14:35
Onthank?
1:14:35
Onthank?
1:14:36
I think he was up there one time or another, because the
1:14:39
name is kind of familiar.
1:14:42
It was in relation to the designation of a primitive area
1:14:46
in the Three Sisters Wilderness?
1:14:49
Well,
1:14:51
that was kind of funny because the Three Sisters Wilderness Area was where the
1:14:58
Obsidians [outdoor recreation and activist organization] went for their horse trips.
1:15:03
Yeah.
1:15:03
Then,
1:15:05
once or twice a summer, you'd see them gather at the CCC Camp.
1:15:10
That's where they took off for the Three Sisters Wilderness Area with their horses.
1:15:15
We'd get inundated with horses and trailers for a weekend.
1:15:21
They would go into the Three Sisters Wilderness Area, come
1:15:24
out and have a good time.
1:15:26
They had a
1:15:29
cabin on the site where the McKenzie Station is now.
1:15:36
Hmm.
1:15:38
And that is where they would hold a lot of meetings.
1:15:45
They were called the Obsidians?
1:15:45
Obsidians.
1:15:45
They were the ones really
1:15:50
concerned about the Willamette National Forest's plan to move the boundary of the
1:16:00
Three Sisters Wilderness Area from where it started to Horse Creek
1:16:06
boundary, to where it is now.
1:16:08
They took out a big chunk of that; that was argued about.
1:16:14
The meetings that announced this change by Supervisor Bruckart, were
1:16:20
held right up at this Obsidian cabin.
1:16:22
I was in on these [laughter] meetings, so I was right in the beginning of the
1:16:29
big controversy over what became the
1:16:35
current
1:16:38
Three Sisters Wilderness Area.
1:16:40
It was ridiculous.
1:16:40
It shouldn't have gone on, because it was just hard-nosed on the part of the
1:16:50
Portland and Willamette timber staff.
1:16:53
It
1:16:55
just left no alternative for them but to fight.
1:17:00
You mean the
1:17:00
-- ? -- Obsidians.
1:17:02
You see, the Obsidians were trying to prevent the dismemberment
1:17:09
of the wilderness area.
1:17:12
They had a cause, the Sierra Club was looking for a
1:17:15
cause, and they got together.
1:17:19
This group, the Obsidians.
1:17:21
I haven't come across that name before.
1:17:22
Well, that was an early group of “horsey” people.
1:17:26
Doctors
1:17:29
and professionals in Eugene had this horse group called the Obsidians.
1:17:35
Oh, I see.
1:17:35
So mainly interested in going out riding?
1:17:37
Yeah, that turned out to be the
1:17:45
start of it, and it was just a horse group.
1:17:48
They didn't see that any more of this should really happen, that
1:17:51
the heart of the wilderness area should be taken out by fiat.
1:17:58
The west boundary of the wilderness area had been left somewhat
1:18:03
indefinite by an act of Congress that set up this wilderness area.
1:18:05
Well, I think it was an act of Congress, anyway.
1:18:07
It very officially set up on other boundaries, but the
1:18:11
west boundary wasn't, and
1:18:16
Bruckart was running out of timber.
1:18:17
[Laughter] That was what was really going on.
1:18:20
He was looking around for places on the Willamette Forest where
1:18:23
they could immediately go in and put in some more sales, and the
1:18:26
west boundary wasn't decided, so it was a good place to challenge.
1:18:30
So, he did.
1:18:32
You attended these meetings, just because they had their cabin right there?
1:18:34
Yeah, it was because they had their cabin there, and it was just good entertainment.
1:18:40
They would have regular meetings out there?
1:18:42
Well, those particular meetings.
1:18:45
Bruckart asked them to meet because he wanted to announce
1:18:48
that this was going to be done.
1:18:50
Oh, I see.
1:18:50
Was
1:18:53
the Obsidian group one of these groups that was part of that social circle?
1:18:58
Well, I'm sure that they had a lot of environmentalists
1:19:01
in this horse riding group.
1:19:05
Actually, I was referring back to when you talking about when the snow
1:19:07
season came on, you would be involved in this social circle of dinners
1:19:12
and invitations back-and-forth.
1:19:13
No, this was the Eugene group.
1:19:15
I was on the McKenzie River and when I would move from the
1:19:19
McKenzie I would go into Portland.
1:19:21
I had no real good contacts in Eugene in
1:19:31
that period.
1:19:31
Okay.
1:19:31
What was the ultimate result?
1:19:34
Well, the ultimate result was that the Sierra Club challenged this
1:19:37
decision to move the boundary of the Three Sisters Wilderness Area.
1:19:43
And did they win that challenge?
1:19:45
No.
1:19:45
They didn't win it.
1:19:46
The Forest Service won,
1:19:50
but they “lost.”
1:19:52
How do you mean?
1:19:52
You know, it later became the focal point of environmental issues.
1:19:58
Won the battle, lost the war?
1:19:59
Yeah.
1:19:59
That's it.
1:20:00
The more they stirred it, the
1:20:04
worse it got.
1:20:04
The Forest Service timber management group were not going to give
1:20:09
in to horse riders from Eugene.
1:20:13
So, essentially, it sounds like an inroad that brought the
1:20:16
-- ? -- This was really the entrance of the Sierra Club out here, that Three
1:20:22
Sisters Wilderness Area conflict.
1:20:24
[Laughter] I was in a funny position for watching it all.
1:20:31
Did they make any effort to involve you in these discussions?
1:20:32
No, they never asked me.
1:20:34
Okay, so research efforts on the Andrews never became a part of the discussion?
1:20:37
Oh, no.
1:20:38
Obviously, the issue there would be roads, right?
1:20:40
Putting in roads and developing the area?
1:20:43
No, that was quite separate.
1:20:44
This developing environmental controversy around that area [Three Sisters and
1:20:51
French Pete Creek] was completely separate from the experimental forest.
1:20:52
But I mean the issue that they were concerned about what would be that,
1:20:55
if it’s not a wilderness, they would be putting in roads in that area?
1:21:01
Oh, sure, and they did.
1:21:02
And, of course, they did log out the old forest wilderness area.
1:21:09
I guess what I was getting at was, did you see any sign that
1:21:12
the environmental movement was dealing with studies of roads?
1:21:15
No, I don't think they got to that at all.
1:21:17
It was just one of interesting sidelights of being there on the ground.
1:21:19
As far as you know,
1:21:28
they didn't know who you were.
1:21:31
No, I don't think they ever knew who I was.
1:21:34
I could have been a horse rider.
1:21:36
Sounds like you were enjoying yourself there.
1:21:43
I probably shouldn't keep you much longer here.
1:21:44
There's
1:21:47
one other issue on this that we were just talking about earlier.
1:21:49
That is, what did you consider to be the public role of research at that time?
1:21:55
Well, public role of research was to get information that was true,
1:22:03
no matter how the chips fell.
1:22:10
I don't think we ever found it to be anything else.
1:22:15
In other words, how does nature work?
1:22:18
And how can we
1:22:24
use that information?
1:22:26
So, public outreach to try and educate the public about those issues,
1:22:31
would you consider that part of the researcher’s role at that time?
1:22:38
You want to get it out somewhere, but we felt we were getting it out
1:22:41
through our station publications and in scientific journals.
1:22:47
That was as far as our thinking went, or at least mine.
1:22:52
How about
1:22:56
bringing politicians out to the site to tour the forest?
1:22:59
Well, that was usually arranged through the Portland office.
1:23:01
You know, by other people.
1:23:03
Okay.
1:23:05
I didn't go out of my way to do it, but there were plenty
1:23:08
of people arranging that.
1:23:09
Did you conduct any tours for people like that?
1:23:13
Sure.
1:23:13
We had dignitaries of one kind or another out there that were arranged for.
1:23:19
Did that create logistical problems of any kind for you?
1:23:21
What?
1:23:21
Did that create logistical problems for you at any time
1:23:28
-- taking care of visitors?
1:23:28
It just interrupted the work, that's all.
1:23:32
We usually looked forward a little bit to it.
1:23:36
It led to breaks in work, and often times these would be weekend things, when
1:23:45
people have the time.
1:23:46
It sounds like that it was something you considered to be really separate from what
1:23:50
you were really trying to do out there.
1:23:51
It wasn’t part of it?
1:23:53
That's right.
1:23:54
I didn't feel that was part of my job.
1:23:56
I felt that if I got that done or didn't get it done, it wasn't important.
1:24:01
The important thing was that I get the sale layout and the research done.
1:24:17
I think we should probably call it quits
1:26:06
for today.
