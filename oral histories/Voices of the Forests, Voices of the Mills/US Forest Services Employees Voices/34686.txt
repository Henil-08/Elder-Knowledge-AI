00:01
This is the interview with Jim Trappe on Monday the 15th of
00:06
September in his office at the Corvallis Forest Science Laboratory.
00:13
Time of the interview is 1:30 in the afternoon.
00:15
Interviewer is Max Geier.
00:16
[tape break]
00:17
I
00:20
might note that my association with the Andrews was a bit peripheral.
00:28
I came for occasional fungus collecting there and so forth, but never had
00:32
any experiments going on there.
00:36
Yeah.
00:36
Ted Dyrness told me that was his perception, also, but that you worked
00:39
with a lot of the people who worked there.
00:40
Oh, yeah.
00:40
Well, that’s kind of what I was interested in for this interview.
00:45
Okay.
00:46
He also told me your association with those people goes back.
00:50
I think he put it, “It goes back....years.” I’m not sure exactly
00:55
what that turned out to be in terms of numbers, but maybe you could talk
00:58
a little bit about your background and becoming involved with these people.
01:02
Also your academic background, how you came to know people like
01:05
Ted Dyrness and Jerry Franklin.
01:07
I understand you worked with them quite a bit.
01:12
I got my Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 1962, although I had
01:19
been working for the PNW [Pacific Northwest] Station since 1958.
01:24
The first two years were at La Grande [Oregon] . The only one I knew that
01:29
had much association with the Andrews at that time was Bob [Tarrant] . But
01:37
then, I was transferred to Portland, and with Tarrant as my supervisor
01:43
to do regeneration research.
01:45
It was a two-person project.
01:49
The first year, we were developing a problem analysis, and getting some small
01:58
studies going, but mostly surveying forest managers and researchers in
02:04
the Northwest, to get an idea of what the major regeneration problems were.
02:10
This took us to the Andrews, because they had quite an active program of
02:15
silvicultural research going there.
02:22
We made several trips there, went out with
02:26
Jack Rothacher and Dick Fredriksen, and maybe some others.
02:31
There’s a photograph of me from about that time hanging out in the
02:37
office down at the Andrews, very scientifically inspecting a seed trap.
02:46
I found that amusing, because I had never done seed trap studies in my life.
02:51
But one time when Tarrant and I were there, Wally Guy, the station [PNW]
02:58
photographer, came along because he wanted some photographs of the Andrews.
03:04
I don’t remember whose study it was, but they took us up there,
03:07
and Wally said, “Jim, go look at that seed trap.” [Laughter] So
03:11
I did, and he took a photograph.
03:13
[Starts
03:16
to speak, but realizes Trappe is not finished] Go ahead.
03:19
I think the most significant research I was involved with there
03:25
had to with the IBP [International Biological Programme], which would
03:30
have been in the early seventies.
03:31
I’d have to look it up, but we had at that time a visiting
03:35
scientist from Japan, Makoto
03:42
Ogawa, and I had a post-doc, Bob Fogel, who had been my Ph.D. student also.
03:53
I guess it was IBP funding that financed them.
03:56
They were studying coarse woody debris there.
04:02
It was Ogawa who originally developed the concept of decay
04:10
classification for coarse woody debris.
04:13
We had this class 1 through 5 system that was adapted by practically everybody on
04:19
the West side [Western Cascades] . He and Bob Fogel worked that out, and I, as
04:28
their supervisor, had some involvement.
04:30
That
04:33
proved a very useful thing.
04:37
That was while you were up in Portland?
04:39
No, no.
04:40
I was down here.
04:41
I came to Corvallis in ‘65.
04:44
Okay.
04:44
I came from La Grande to Portland in ’58, and here, in ‘65.
04:52
Before you started working for the Forest Service in ‘58, you were working at
04:57
University of Washington on your Ph.D. Are you from the Northwest originally?
05:00
Spokane.
05:00
Spokane?
05:00
Okay.
05:02
I actually have worked for the PNW since ’56;
05:06
at La Grande the first two years, and then Portland.
05:09
I was on the Colville National Forest [Washington] before that.
05:14
Okay.
05:16
Was your undergraduate degree
05:20
at Washington?
05:20
The University of Washington, and the masters at Syracuse [University]
05:24
Did
05:27
you know
05:29
Russ Mitchell?
05:31
Oh, yeah.
05:32
I interviewed him last year.
05:36
Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the areas of interest or
05:41
fields of study in which you worked.
05:42
The Ph.D. work
05:47
was on mycorrhizae.
05:52
It focused on a particular, very common and widespread mycorrhizae
05:58
fungus, Cenococcum geophilum,
06:01
and I did some collecting on the Andrews with that, but it was on the ecology and
06:06
physiology of this particular fungus.
06:11
Then, in the course of working on mycorrhizae, I was digging up root
06:17
samples regularly, and I kept encountering
06:21
truffles and related fungi.
06:25
So, I’d take them back, and Professor Daniel Stuntz at University of
06:29
Washington, who was my mycological mentor
06:33
-- -- Daniel
06:35
--? -- Stuntz.
06:35
S-t-u-n-t-z.
06:37
Okay.
06:40
He’d work with me on trying to key these things out, but with the
06:44
keys that were available, usually we’d throw up our hands in despair.
06:50
[Chuckle] He’d say, “Well, send these to Alexander H. Smith in Michigan,
06:53
because he’s working on this group.” So I would, and Smith, the first
06:58
time, wrote back, “This is a [first] report for the State of Washington.
07:03
Get more.” So I went out and looked for more stuff, sent it to him, and
07:09
he said, “Well, this is a different species, it’s a new undescribed species.
07:13
Get more.” He always ended his letters, “Get more.” So, after
07:19
all, I spent as much time looking for truffles as for mycorrhizae.
07:25
Then, when I finally wound up in Corvallis, and where it was reasonably
07:34
convenient to get to the Andrews, I went down there a fair amount
07:38
just collecting these fungi, and of course, other places as well.
07:44
You mentioned you’d go to the Andrews in your Ph.D. work, and
07:48
also when you’re here in Corvallis.
07:49
Yeah, that would have just been one or two quick swings through
07:53
to collect some root samples.
07:55
What was the attraction that brought you down there in particular?
07:58
Well, because it was the Andrews, and there was a lot of stuff going on there.
08:02
You heard about other people’s work there?
08:03
Yeah, and I was a good friend of Dick Fredriksen, who was there at the
08:08
time, so I could crash at his place.
08:11
He was at the University of Washington with me, and we were classmates
08:17
in the Ph.D. program at
08:21
the College of Forestry.
08:22
But it wasn’t the main focus of where you were?
08:23
No.
08:27
Then, after you got to Corvallis around ’65, you began to go there
08:30
more frequently, it sounds like?
08:31
Yeah.
08:32
That would have been of course, the time when the IBP begins to pick up?
08:36
Yeah.
08:36
Was that
08:39
the main reason why you started to work down there?
08:42
No, it was just because it was a convenient place to sample the roots
08:46
and fungi from a variety of habitats.
08:51
And we were encouraged to work there because it was an experimental forest,
08:54
and they wanted to get focused there to the degree it was reasonable.
09:00
Were you encouraged by Bob Tarrant, or other people?
09:03
Yeah.
09:04
Station [PNW] policy, in general, came from our assistant director.
09:09
The reason I ask, is that Jerry Franklin mentioned that he had seen a memo
09:13
which came through, he’s not sure of the date, from ‘62 to ‘65, somewhere
09:15
in there, a proposal to close the Andrews, and he was thinking that the
09:19
way to save it from being closed was to get more people working down there.
09:22
That could well be.
09:23
I don’t recall that, but Jerry would have been much more involved in that
09:27
sort of thing than I would be anyhow.
09:29
Sure.
09:30
Maybe you could talk a little bit about your first impressions when you
09:34
started, when you got to the Ph.D. work, and when you first went down there.
09:38
That’d be the first time you visited the Andrews?
09:40
I imagine, yeah.
09:41
Do you recall much about it at that point?
09:42
No.
09:42
[Chuckle]
09:42
Not surprising.
09:42
[Laughs] I’ve heard there wasn’t much there.
09:42
By ’65, when you started to spend more time there, what’s your recollection
09:42
of the place at that point?
09:43
Well, there
09:46
were
09:57
a lot fewer clear-cuts [chuckle], and some of the research that was going on,
10:08
appeared to me to be groundbreaking.
10:13
I recall the watershed studies were
10:19
underway, and they were sampling streamflow and water quality from
10:26
different cutting treatments, and burning versus controls.
10:29
I
10:32
think that was the first time that sort of thing was done in the Northwest.
10:35
It seemed to offer a lot of promise, and in fact, they did
10:39
learn a lot from those studies.
10:45
A lot more
10:49
ecological kinds of studies going on than maybe happened later, in the sense of
10:56
seed production and dispersal by the various conifer species.
11:02
Maybe there wasn’t more than there was recently, but it impressed me at the
11:08
time that there was some really good, fundamental kinds of studies, going on.
11:14
Were there people working up there that you had not run across
11:16
before you started working there?
11:18
Jack Rothacher would be one, and I don’t remember who else was there at the time.
11:26
Ted Dyrness had stuff going on, I’m sure, but I don’t recall what Ted was
11:31
doing, particularly associated with
11:34
the Andrews.
11:37
You’ve mentioned Jack Rothacher several times.
11:39
It sounds like he was someone you worked with
11:44
maybe?
11:45
No, I really didn’t ever work with Jack, but got acquainted
11:49
with him, probably through Jerry.
11:53
Then it turns out that Jack and his wife, Jerry and his wife, and
11:59
I, went on many backpacks in the Cascades together over the years.
12:02
We got to be quite good friends.
12:04
Okay.
12:05
Jack was into hydrology, as
12:08
I recall, which was totally different than anything I was
12:14
involved with, research-wise.
12:16
I was talking to Jean [Rothacher – Jack’s wife] , and she was talking
12:18
about these backpacking trips.
12:19
They formed the “Lost Ladies Group.”
12:26
[Laughter] She said the men had a different agenda in going
12:28
hiking than the women did.
12:31
Yeah, well, Jerry and Jack were
12:35
both guys who could hardly wait to see what was over the next ridge,
12:41
and I was always looking for fungi, so I would always be a little
12:46
bit more casual in my hiking, a “tortoise and hare” sort of thing.
12:51
And then the ladies had their own interest and agenda.
12:56
Well, we each did our own thing and it worked out well.
13:00
It sounds like, although Jerry was working in a different field, that you
13:03
knew him before you went down there and started working at the Andrews?
13:07
Yeah.
13:08
I knew Jerry, and as I recall, when we were
13:15
in Corvallis, he got there a year or two after I did.
13:18
We were a little bit younger and
13:21
identified mutual interests like backpacking and ecology
13:26
and botanizing and so forth.
13:28
It was just good empathy there.
13:31
So, it was more the office work up in Portland, than working where you
13:37
worked and when you did research there?
13:39
[H.J. Andrews]
13:39
. Yeah.
13:40
Jerry was still working on his thesis at the time, which was a
13:45
habitat- type concept, and flying back to the northwestern forests.
13:55
After we got down here, we did some field trips together.
14:00
I was pretty interested in the habitat-type concepts that he was
14:03
developing, and I was project leader here in forest pathology and mycology.
14:13
I wondered; did habitat type relate to
14:19
root diseases in general, Phellinus weirii, or laminated
14:23
root rot, in particular?
14:26
So, he and I went up into the Oregon Cascades for a few days, and he’d
14:29
identify a particular habitat type, and then, I’d just make a quick
14:37
eyeball survey of incidences of laminated root rot.
14:43
We found some very striking differences between habitat types.
14:49
I remember one, in which there were two distinct habitat types
14:53
just butted up against each other - you could almost draw a line.
14:56
And because of the volcanic geology in the Cascades, there
15:00
can be some very abrupt changes.
15:03
In one habitat type, there was just downed trees and sick trees all over the
15:09
place, but one could walk 50 feet into the other habitat type, and I couldn’t find
15:14
a sign of it at all of Phellinus weirii.
15:19
Let’s see, there was something else popping in my head.....it
15:23
will come to me later.
15:29
Did you do any work at Cascade Head?
15:31
Yeah.
15:32
Probably more at Cascade Head than at the
15:39
Andrews.
15:39
Particularly some studies with Bob Tarrant, who had been transferred to
15:44
Corvallis a couple years after I was.
15:50
On the alder crops down there that were established back in the mid
15:59
1930’s, Bob did soil comparisons, and I did comparisons of fungi
16:05
on the pure alder versus the pure conifer versus the alder-conifer mix.
16:12
Then, we had a student, C.Y. Lee, who is still at Corvallis,
16:18
who was looking at the effects
16:26
of alder on soil microbiology with particular reference to how changes
16:34
in the soil microbial community might affect the laminated root rot fungus.
16:40
So, there was quite a lot going on down there.
16:41
And then, Alexander Smith from the University of Washington, whom I
16:46
mentioned earlier as being the guy I sent specimens to, I invited him
16:52
to come out and stay at Cascade Head during the fall fungal fruiting season.
16:58
He did that at least twice, and then one of his students, Joe
17:02
Ammirati, came the third year to collect, because mycologically, it’s
17:08
a very rich and interesting area.
17:10
Ammirati is now a professor at University of Washington, and Alexander Smith’s
17:17
daughter Nancy Webber is here in the Department of Forest Science now, so
17:22
there’s a lot of interlinkages there.
17:31
I was wondering if you could recall your impressions, first impressions of
17:37
Cascade Head as compared with the Andrews.
17:47
Well,
17:49
I think they were both of equal interest to me.
17:53
Cascade Head was nice to go to because it was close to the beach.
17:58
But I was usually going there in the rainy season [laughter], so the
18:02
beach didn’t call me out that much, when I was working there, anyhow.
18:09
The different habitats that each had and how they contrasted with each other,
18:14
were quite informative to me in terms of
18:20
the ecology and diversity of fungi.
18:22
It’s at Cascade Head I learned that, no matter how wet the summer may be,
18:28
a lot of the mushroom species will not fruit until, mid-October or later.
18:36
It can be pouring rain there in August and a few things will fruit,
18:40
but most of them will still wait.
18:41
And that was a good area to observe that where ecologically there’s
18:51
something more than just wetness and coolness involved, probably the
18:57
physiological state of the trees, which are the hosts of mycorrhizal fungi.
19:05
Was that a species?
19:09
Well, all the hundreds of mycorrhizal tree species form mycorrhizae with fungi
19:16
that mostly produce either mushrooms or truffles as their fruiting bodies.
19:18
So, that also includes fungi on alders.
19:19
In most forests of the Northwest, the main forest overstory components would
19:29
be associated with those kinds of fungi.
19:34
You mentioned earlier that one of your first reasons for going
19:37
to the Andrews, was because there was someone you knew there.
19:41
Dick Fredriksen.
19:43
Dick Fredriksen.
19:44
You knew him through graduate work?
19:46
Yeah.
19:46
He was living there at the time, is that right?
19:49
Right.
19:50
Can you talk to me a bit about your recollection of the facilities?
19:53
I think he was living in Blue River?
19:55
Yeah, there at the ranger station.
19:57
The station had, I guess, a couple of houses.
20:01
The
20:04
Andrews had an office in the ranger station building, but I don’t remember for
20:11
sure.
20:12
Very little in the way of laboratory facilities, but of
20:15
course it’s a field facility, so they wouldn’t have needed much.
20:24
It was fairly routine Forest Service-type housing they had there.
20:31
I presume they probably had a bunk house for crews, because most ranger stations
20:35
did at that time, but I always stayed with Fredriksen when they were still there.
20:45
It’s interesting because
20:48
Dick Fredriksen was a watershed researcher, and I was curious about the
20:56
way in which your daily work schedule would go, if you’re down on the Andrews.
21:00
What kinds of activities would you be involved in that period?
21:04
What kinds of things would you be doing?
21:06
Mostly, when I was there it had to do with field sampling of roots and fungi.
21:15
And I was usually doing that by myself, so I was really flexible and could just
21:22
work it out darn near any way I pleased.
21:27
I did a lot of
21:31
just exploring around on the roads and some of the trails seeking out different
21:35
types of habitat, because at that time, I was interested in the differences
21:40
between different ages of stands, or wet versus dry stands and that sort of thing.
21:48
There wasn’t really a routine to it.
21:51
I just set out in the morning and did my thing.
21:53
So you worked mainly off the existing logging roads?
21:56
Pretty much, yeah.
21:57
Didn’t do a lot of cross country?
21:59
No, not a whole lot, because
22:05
it took too much time.
22:07
I’d go down for maybe two days, and I’d want to hit as many different
22:12
kinds of habitat as I could, so doing that by road was the easiest.
22:17
So, I take it you did pretty much the same thing at the Cascade
22:20
Head when you were working there?
22:21
Yeah.
22:22
Did you notice any differences in the road structure or the accessibility of places?
22:27
No, not much, although there was probably more access at Cascade
22:34
Head, more frequency of roads.
22:41
Because like Wildcat Mountain, no, not Wildcat Mountain, but some of the summits
22:48
on the Andrews hadn’t been roaded yet, and some of the drainages for that matter.
22:53
But
22:57
the Andrews is so much bigger than Cascade Head, that even with a more
23:02
sparse road system, the Andrews still had a lot of access to different habitats.
23:03
When you went down there to stay
23:08
at the Fredriksens, did you wind up staying for about a week at a time?
23:12
Not
23:15
that I recall.
23:15
Okay.
23:15
At that time,
23:18
my wife and I had our first kid, and then, we had our second kid, and so, I tried
23:24
not to stay away for too long of a time.
23:29
When
23:33
you were working at the Andrews in that period, did you have a lot of
23:38
free time, or did you schedule free time for yourself to go and talk
23:41
to the people in the community of Blue River or elsewhere in the area
23:45
? Not really.
23:46
I had too much fun doing my quote, “work.” [Laughter] I was enjoying
23:51
that thoroughly, had plenty of people to talk to around here, so I didn’t
23:55
really know anybody at Blue River.
23:57
I was in
24:00
PNW country.
24:00
That was in the
24:05
early 50’s?
24:05
Early 60’s.
24:06
Oh, early 60’s.
24:06
Well, mid-60’s actually.
24:09
Because it was ‘65 when I moved to Corvallis, so, prior to that,
24:15
it was just maybe a couple of trips from Portland down there.
24:18
Okay.
24:18
I see.
24:18
I was a little bit off base here because I was thinking you were talking about
24:22
when you were doing your doctoral work.
24:24
No, this was after the doctoral work.
24:26
The doctoral work was just at most, two, and maybe only one trip,
24:31
to the Andrews over that period, so that was very incidental.
24:34
Where’d you stay at that time?
24:38
I don’t remember.
24:39
I might have been camping, because I did a lot of that during my field sampling.
24:44
In
24:51
the beginning of your stage of working at the PNW Station,
25:00
what would you say was your view of the role of experimental forests in
25:05
the station [region] at that time?
25:06
Well, when I
25:09
started at La Grande, we had the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range.
25:11
It was an
25:17
extremely
25:22
valuable and useful facility for the kinds of studies that
25:25
were regarded as high priority,
25:31
and the Starkey actually had some pretty good accommodations,
25:36
probably better that the Andrews did at that time; in the late 50’s.
25:44
That was before I was married, and I spent all summer out at the headquarters.
25:50
So, when I got transferred over to Portland, and went to Andrews
25:56
with Bob Tarrant a few times,
25:59
it seemed to me like this was really an ideal working situation.
26:06
The argument was made then that the Forest Service was better positioned
26:14
to do long-term research than universities, because the Forest
26:19
Service had stability, could make long-term commitments, and so forth.
26:25
Whereas the universities had more turnover, students and so forth, and
26:33
might have their own experimental forests, but these were not as expansive
26:40
and did not represent as wide an array of northwestern habitats, as did the
26:45
Forest Service experimental forests.
26:50
The fallacy of that in recent years, has proven to be that while the Forest Service
27:00
is a relatively stable organization, their funding is not.
27:05
So, you start a long-term study, then they cut funding.
27:10
That’s just long-term integrated research sites that started out a few
27:17
years ago as two-hundred-year studies, and got funding for two years, and
27:21
then the program goes to pieces.
27:27
Anyhow, the experimental forests were expected to fill that role.
27:33
There’s quite a bunch of them.
27:36
There’s the South Umpqua Experimental Forest in Douglas County or somewhere
27:42
down there, and several others scattered around that seem to have been
27:48
disenfranchised, like the South Umpqua Experimental Forest [It was partially
27:52
disestablished, but not completely] . So, I guess as the needs and perceptions
27:57
of priorities change, experimental forests became less and less relevant
28:04
to what the station’s mission became.
28:07
I think
28:12
the Andrews, as you mentioned, was in danger of being closed at
28:20
that time.
28:21
But, the amount of research being done at the Andrews, the role that
28:28
universities, OSU especially, remain in using that area for research.
28:37
That has resulted in it being so valuable, that ultimately, nobody
28:42
would think of discontinuing it.
28:44
Then, the
28:47
NSF started a long-term ecological reserve program [IBP/LTER] , so
28:52
I think it’s really a great thing that we still have it.
28:56
Around the same period of time, the research natural area program was
29:06
starting up.
29:06
You were involved with some of that, weren’t you?
29:08
Well, in a peripheral way.
29:11
Within the station, Jerry was probably a leading force there.
29:17
I collaborated with him a few times on locating some candidate areas.
29:23
That was fun stuff, but important to do.
29:28
My understanding is that you were in kind of the same situation,
29:31
where there was a concern in the early 60’s about demonstrating there
29:36
were some utility to these places.
29:37
Oh, yeah, there still is.
29:41
I don’t know if you’ve talked to Sarah Greene?
29:43
No, I
29:46
haven’t.
29:46
She’s been in charge of the RNA program, and is probably is the best
29:54
source on the history of that, how it evolved, and how it’s going today.
29:59
I know
30:02
she wants to have documented all uses of those RNA’s, because
30:10
they’ve been under fire in times past, and they seem to be pretty firmly established
30:16
and respected now, but who knows in the future when there’s going to be new
30:21
pressures to put them to other uses.
30:25
So, it’s important to document how those are used.
30:29
This does remind me
30:33
about something I said a little bit ago
30:39
. Jerry organized this trip to
30:45
the Wheeler Creek Research Natural Area down in Southwest Oregon.
30:52
He did this purposefully, because he
30:57
and I knew each other well, and he also knew a fellow by the name of Chris Maser,
31:02
a wildlife biologist and ecologist.
31:08
Jerry thought Chris and I ought to get acquainted, and he thought the best way to
31:16
do that would be to take us on a long trip in a car, then get out in the woods in a
31:22
research natural area and prowl around.
31:26
So, we did that.
31:27
Chris and
31:29
I found conversation with each
31:36
other interesting, and I told him I was interested particularly in forest fungi,
31:40
and he was working with small mammals.
31:43
He said, “You know, I’ve been studying the California red-backed vole.
31:51
And every once in a while I’ve found one that has something in its mouth
31:55
that appears to be a piece of fungus.” So, I said, “Well, gee, next time that
32:03
happens, save it and I’ll look at it.” “Oh,” he said; “I have saved them.”
32:09
The upshot of this was that he brought me some of these specimens, also
32:14
specimens of fecal pellets of various animals, and stomach contents preserved
32:24
in ethanol.
32:24
I looked at them and found spores of all kinds of truffles and truffle-like fungi.
32:32
He
32:36
had a tremendous number of collections from all kinds of native small mammals.
32:43
Over the next couple of years we collaborated pretty closely,
32:48
and published a paper that
32:54
had tremendous influence on research on the use of these fungi by small mammals,
33:04
and how that information could be useful in understanding the habits and
33:10
habitat that various animals occupied.
33:15
Then Chris got a position with the Bureau of Land Management, had an office in
33:22
this wing of the building, and he and I then collaborated several more years
33:27
studying the role of coarse woody debris in the forest ecosystem, and we got
33:27
out some seminal publications on that.
33:28
So,
33:38
while we didn’t actually conduct many of these studies, Chris and I did
33:45
work on the Andrews and Cascade Head.
33:49
We did have specimens from both that Chris had trapped.
33:56
It all was brought together by Jerry, who perceived these
34:00
two people needed to connect.
34:03
Was that the Wheeler Creek Natural Research Area?
34:03
Yeah.
34:03
What is
34:14
your perception of the intended differences between research natural
34:18
areas and experimental forests, and their roles in research?
34:26
I suppose a major difference, at least as I see it, is that research natural
34:31
areas are to be kept as natural areas, whereas experimental forests offer the
34:38
opportunity for various manipulations of the forest; timber harvest, or brush
34:44
control, or prescribed burning and what have you, or grazing at the Starkey.
34:52
So, they serve quite different purposes, and I think both are equally important.
34:59
Now, at a time when biodiversity is regarded as an important consideration,
35:06
because we have the research natural areas, we have some places where we can
35:11
get baseline data of what a relatively undisturbed forest produces in terms of
35:17
various organisms, fungi, for example.
35:22
Then we can use that
35:26
to compare with stands that have been manipulated one way or another,
35:32
and start getting some ideas of how these manipulations or the
35:37
different successional stages differ in terms of various organisms.
35:44
How would you describe the frequency of use for
35:49
research natural areas?
35:51
Do people tend to make use of them for research, or not?
35:56
Well, I’m sure they do.
35:58
I really don’t have any
36:02
quantitative feeling for that.
36:04
Again, Sarah Greene would be the ideal source for that sort of information.
36:12
I haven’t used a whole lot of natural research areas in our fungal work,
36:20
I guess mostly because
36:26
of the sorts of things we’ve been doing.
36:29
The manipulated stands have been more important, but I think now I’m
36:37
making much more use of the RNA’s.
36:39
In fact, this year I’m doing a mushroom and truffle survey of the
36:45
eight research natural areas on the Roseburg BLM [Bureau of Land
36:49
Management] District, at their request.
36:53
They want to know what’s there.
36:57
So, when you go to study at the Andrews, one of the appeals
37:02
there is the ecosystem sites, I
37:07
would assume?
37:09
Uh-huh [Affirmative].
37:09
And what you’re dealing with at the Andrews is a managed forest, but
37:12
one of the unique characteristics of the Andrews involves these areas
37:15
that are relatively untouched?
37:17
Right.
37:18
I guess what I’m getting at is; what is the difference in terms of
37:23
establishing a research program, and going to a place like the Andrews that
37:28
has managed forests and relatively untouched stands, versus going to
37:32
a research natural area, which I gather you didn’t do a great deal?
37:35
In
37:38
a place like the Andrews, you have stands that have been treated in
37:44
a variety of ways, adjacent to stands that have not been entered
37:51
[treated] . Research natural areas are set up to represent particular vegetation or
38:01
other types of natural features.
38:05
They’re not designed to be a comparison with anything in particular.
38:12
They’re designed to preserve a representative sample of something,
38:18
usually a vegetation or forest type.
38:21
So again, they’re two different things.
38:26
Now, in the sorts of things I’m interested in now, I’d probably be
38:30
more inclined, if I had the resources to do it, to compare the RNA’s fungal
38:42
populations, again, to develop the kind of baseline data we don’t have for
38:48
fungi, very much anywhere in the world.
38:51
Then
38:53
having done that, expand to see how
39:03
similar habitat types that have been disturbed in one way or another,
39:07
compare, and get some idea of the fungal succession, say from the old
39:16
forest as compared to the just-starting forests, the young forest, the
39:21
middle-age forest, and so forth.
39:23
We know there is a succession, but we don’t know much about the details, what
39:30
those details mean, and to what degree is the diversity of mychorrizae fungi
39:35
important to the health of the forest.
39:41
You talked about working with Dick Fredriksen a little bit up there.
39:45
In the 60’s or going back to your graduate [school] days, did
39:50
you do much research with him?
39:51
No, it was mostly visiting and crashing at his place, and then I’d
39:55
go out and do my own thing, because he was doing soil and hydrologic work
39:59
there, which was not very closely akin to what I was up to at the time.
40:05
But you were working with Bob Tarrant to some degree?
40:08
Yes, on the regeneration.
40:09
In more general
40:17
terms, could you describe your level of involvement with others at the Andrews.
40:22
People who were doing research up there, who weren’t necessarily
40:24
residents on site, but were down there?
40:35
Probably not a whole lot, other than my own sampling.
40:41
The
40:44
work at that time we were doing in my project had to do more with
40:51
nursery production of planting stock with mycorrhizae, and of a
40:59
laminated root rot on the forest pathology end.
41:03
The laminated root rot work was mostly in the Coast Range.
41:13
A question here about where you went for relaxation, but it sounds to me like the
41:16
work was actually kind of a relaxation?
41:18
Oh yeah.
41:18
I love getting
41:23
out in the woods!
41:24
In general terms, you talked about going to the Andrews and some surrounding areas.
41:29
But wasn’t your field work pretty widespread around Oregon?
41:35
Yeah.
41:35
Mostly in Oregon?
41:37
Oregon and Washington.
41:37
Okay, and Washington.
41:40
At the time you were working down there [H.J. Andrews] , did you
41:42
have any degree of involvement with people at the district?
41:45
It didn’t sound like it, regarding the Blue River [Ranger] Station?
41:50
One thing I’m interested in, is how research questions are formed,
41:53
and where those ideas come from.
41:57
Were there ever questions posed to you by management, or concerns
42:01
that they had that they asked for information about, that might have
42:05
affected the kind of research you did?
42:08
We didn’t have a whole lot of interest initially by management
42:13
on our mycorrhizae work.
42:17
But,
42:21
as time went on,
42:25
one industrial forester, Nick Freemyers, became convinced
42:27
mycorrhizae were really important, particularly in Northern California.
42:30
He
42:33
put together a co-operative with Northern California and Southwestern
42:39
Oregon companies, and the BLM and Forest Service, to fund our studies on
42:46
mycorrhizal inoculation of nursery stock.
42:49
Probably, most of the
42:53
concern by forest managers was on the forest pathology side, especially on
42:59
laminated root rot and forest mistletoe.
43:07
I’m trying to remember where our emphasis came from the studies of
43:11
coarse woody debris that got Ogawa
43:19
and Fogel funded at the Andrews.
43:20
It must have been raised through some of the IBP group discussions here.
43:29
But, having done that,
43:33
and having torn apart some rotten logs, and looking at the roots and other
43:39
organisms in these things, I certainly became convinced they are playing
43:44
some very special role in the forest.
43:49
Ogawa
43:52
not only did the log classification, but also quite meticulously, I was
44:02
going to say excavation, but that doesn’t quite convey the right thing.
44:08
He mapped the
44:13
forest floor down to mineral soil, over a fairly large area, I forget how big,
44:22
but maybe a quarter-acre or something.
44:25
And he’d go through it bit-by-bit; this was on the Andrews.
44:29
He discovered
44:32
that
44:36
well more than half of the surface of the ground was covered with old
44:45
cubicle, brown cubicle, rotted wood.
44:48
Now you wouldn’t see it because it was covered with humus and you’d see the logs.
44:53
But over centuries, these logs clump and get flattened out, and eventually,
45:01
at most, there might be a little mound, or not even a mound, it’d be just flat.
45:07
But you’d look under the humus and there would be this layer of rotten wood.
45:12
This is
45:16
a very different thing from what one would see in a clear-cut
45:19
or even after a forest fire.
45:21
After a forest fire, there are spots where you had really hot burns and
45:25
everything’s ash down to mineral soil, but a good share of the forest floor, may be
45:32
ashed or charred on the surface, but the underlying humus could still be intact.
45:36
If you log the thing, all that stuff is disrupted and moved
45:41
around, mixed up and so forth.
45:47
Ogawa showed us this,
45:50
a very real difference in what’s left behind after
45:53
clearcutting, compared to fire.
45:58
Well, what’s the significance of that?
46:00
People are still working on it.
46:02
Mark Harmon and Tom Spies are doing a lot of work with coarse wood debris.
46:07
There was a lot of work done in Idaho by foresters and researchers there.
46:14
They discovered in Idaho conditions, that most of the fine root growth
46:22
during the summer was taking place where there was this rotten wood
46:30
under the soil.
46:30
We’ve done studies on those finds, and found much the same
46:34
thing as the Idaho guys did.
46:36
We found that this old brown cubicle rotted wood can hold up to
46:42
six times its weight in moisture.
46:44
It’s like a sponge.
46:47
And actually, these mounds of rotten wood on the forest floor are almost like
46:54
perched water tables during the summer.
46:55
You can go out to a place like the Andrews,
47:00
when we’ve had a dry summer, you go out where there’s mineral soil,
47:06
and it will be powdery dry, and all the fine roots, the feeder roots
47:10
for the trees, will be shriveled up, the feeder roots of the trees.
47:12
You get down under one of these old rotten logs, and you can sometimes even squeeze
47:17
water out it, and there’ll be all kinds of lush root growth and fungal activity,
47:22
even during the dry parts of summer.
47:24
So I think it’s very important material for our kind of climatic situation.
47:31
It provided a source of moisture even during an extended dry spell in summer.
47:40
So, your work picked up on those themes?
47:43
Yeah, right.
47:46
Could you identify a major or some particular publication that
47:49
would be a good summary of that.
47:53
Maser and I wrote PNW
48:00
General Technical Report 164, The Seen and Unseen World of the Fallen Tree.
48:06
That came out some time in 1984.
48:13
After that, there was another
48:17
multi-authored and larger report, General Technical Report 229,
48:26
edited by Maser, Tarrant, Trappe and Franklin, and
48:34
Swanson,
48:37
called From the Forest to the Sea, A Story of Fallen Trees, something like that.
48:48
One thing I’m curious about is how you saw your role in taking research and making
48:56
it available for some broader audiences.
48:59
What did you
49:04
see as your target in regards to publishing research and getting
49:08
research support ? [funds, etc.]
49:08
Well, we had multiple targets.
49:13
Certainly, we tried to design our studies so we would be learning new
49:21
fundamental things about what we were looking at, but then, we wanted to
49:30
convey that to people concerned with forest management, whether it be
49:37
environmentalists, Forest Service managers, or timber company people.
49:43
To try to convey to them why these things are important to their interests.
49:49
The Seen and Unseen World of the Fallen Tree, is kind of a combination of those.
49:58
We tried to write it in a way that the lay reader wouldn’t be
50:03
intimidated, but at the same time,
50:08
presenting a lot of information from both our own studies, and the
50:12
literature, trying to pull it all together so it made a cohesive story.
50:20
I think it’s a pretty good publication.
50:22
That’s one I’m especially proud of.
50:24
Is that a PNW publication?
50:26
Yeah.
50:26
I think I have one here somewhere.
50:29
I know I have one at home.
50:32
I can probably pick it up in the publications that are over here.
50:35
If they’ve got a complete set, I know you can.
50:40
While we’re talking, let me pull up the reference here
50:44
so you know what to look for.
51:36
While you’re looking for that, I was wondering if there was anybody at the
51:42
national forest level who might have been
51:47
your contact for trying to get information out from your studies, if
51:50
you saw something you thought would be relevant to management interests and
51:56
concerns about management of the forest.
52:00
Along those lines, probably the person that
52:05
I dealt with mostly when I was working in the regeneration project, was Bob
52:10
Tarrant, and the regional office had a guy in charge of regeneration by
52:17
the name of Harold Dahl; D-a-h-l.
52:22
Harold was a very good communicator and a good
52:30
asker of questions.
52:34
That’s Seen and Unseen World of Fallen Trees, General Technical Report, PNW
52:44
164, published in 1984 [showing
52:55
Geier copy] . With the red alder research,
52:58
we had a
53:03
lot of interest from forest managers, and,
53:09
collectively, several of us, Bob Tarrant, C.Y. Li, and
53:19
K.C. Lou, who was a microbiologist with our group, and a professor,
53:27
Walter Bollen from the OSU Department of Microbiology, joined forces.
53:33
I don’t know whose idea it was originally, but in a lot of conversations, we all
53:41
agreed that the manner in which red alder
53:47
influences forest soil structure, builds up of nitrogen,
53:52
reduces soil pH, and
54:01
perhaps helps cleanse the soil of laminated root rot.
54:13
We started a series of experiments to test that concept and some of these were
54:18
done at the Andrews, as we said earlier.
54:25
We
54:29
actually did some big studies on the
54:34
incidence of laminated root rot in mixed Doug-fir–alder stands,
54:39
compared to pure Douglas-fir stands.
54:43
And that involved the hiring of Everett Hansen, a
54:50
post-doc.
54:53
Everett, subsequently
54:57
was hired for the open forest pathology position in the OSU Botany and Plant
55:03
Pathology Department, where he is today.
55:08
When was he hired as a post-doc with your group?
55:11
Well, I
55:13
suppose sometime around 1980.
55:16
That’s when a lot of
55:27
this was happening.
55:27
Very little of that was done on the Andrews, but a lot was done at Cascade
55:31
Head because of these old red alder plots set up there in the 1930’s.
55:36
Pure alder, versus pure conifer versus alder-conifer mixed.
55:50
We were talking about connections with the forest.
55:52
Okay, with forest management.
55:53
At that time, the Siuslaw National Forest had declared war on red alder,
56:03
and they were spewing herbicides around like nobody’s business.
56:08
They were putting herbicides on alder, not only to release Douglas-fir
56:14
from alder competition, but also they were spraying alder everywhere.
56:20
I’m not sure I ever heard this said, but I got the impression that they were
56:23
trying to eradicate the seed source.
56:26
They wanted alder off of the Siuslaw Forest.
56:35
We were doing our work and I heard from some the Siuslaw people asking
56:40
at the time, why were we wasting money on a weed like alder that
56:45
everyone wanted to get rid of.
56:46
So, this was in the early 80’s?
56:49
Sometime
56:52
around there.
56:56
I was the project leader for forest pathology, so I tried to
57:01
explain why we had this interest.
57:04
Well,
57:06
alder isn’t going to do anything for us there, and just good silviculture
57:11
will take care of the problem . At that time, laminated root rot was thought
57:18
to be primarily a disease of large boles and small soft timber size trees.
57:27
Then,
57:30
somewhere in the Coast Range out of Corvallis, a bunch of
57:34
tree saplings started dying.
57:37
The pathologists were called in, and
57:42
these were plantations of seven- to ten-year-old trees.
57:52
I think
57:55
it
58:06
was Everett Hansen and Earl Nelson here, who went and looked at these trees, and
58:10
behold, they had laminated root rot.
58:15
That’s about when we had convincing evidence that if you have a laminated
58:21
root rot center, tree death occurs.
58:23
The fungus persists in the soil
58:29
a long time, we know now that’s fifty to seventy or more years in a more or
58:36
less dormant stage in old rotted roots.
58:39
When a root from a young tree
58:43
contacts a buried dormant fungus, it can be reactivated and infect
58:48
the new root, and then, work its way into the root system.
58:53
What was happening,
58:57
they were clearcutting laminated root rot areas, and planting
59:03
Douglas-fir right on top of
59:07
infected soil.
59:08
We hypothesized later that
59:13
the natural succession in the Coast Range would be, you’d have fire and
59:20
then alder, or at higher elevations, perhaps sitka spruce and vine maple, that
59:30
are not infected by the disease.
59:33
You’d have an alternating rotation between the susceptible Doug-fir and
59:39
non-susceptible alders or shrubs.
59:40
During this alder-shrub occupation, over time, much of the residual
59:50
inoculum of the disease would die out.
59:54
So we thought, if alder affects the soil to the point, it
1:00:01
more or less hastens the demise of the fungus.
1:00:05
If true, then it would be a good intermediate rotation for
1:00:09
these old root rot centers.
1:00:12
Once the mortality from laminated root rot in young stands was discovered,
1:00:20
then people got to looking at it, and it was found to be much more
1:00:23
extensive than anybody guessed.
1:00:27
Red alder is absolutely resistant to the disease.
1:00:33
I think it was over about a two-year period, that
1:00:38
the Siuslaw Forest went from criticizing us for doing alder research, and
1:00:45
spraying herbicide all over the place,
1:00:52
to planting alder and growing it in nurseries.
1:00:56
They could plant red alder in root rot infection centers.
1:00:56
Moreover, the alder sawmill industry people had been upset
1:00:56
with the Siuslaw, because
1:01:06
they wanted a continuing supply of alder, and Siuslaw was trying to get rid of it.
1:01:10
So, that was kind of fun to see one’s participation in a research
1:01:16
project lead to such a drastic change in management practices.
1:01:22
And, to this day, I feel is a much more sound ecological practice.
1:01:29
You mentioned Harold Dahl is one person with the region [Region 6, USFS] . Would
1:01:32
he have been involved with this shift?
1:01:35
Or who is the person or the people you see as key in that two-year
1:01:40
period of shifting policy?
1:01:46
I guess I don’t really know that.
1:01:47
I didn’t have all that much direct contact with the Siuslaw people.
1:01:52
Everett Hansen and Earl Nelson would probably know who that might
1:01:59
have been on the Siuslaw Forest.
1:02:04
So, the dissemination of information wouldn’t be you talking directly to them?
1:02:08
No.
1:02:10
Somehow, they would pick it up through channels?
1:02:12
Yeah.
1:02:13
I
1:02:19
have
1:02:23
never had any problem with talking with forest managers or lay people, and trying
1:02:29
to explain what we’re doing and why.
1:02:32
In fact, I rather enjoy doing that.
1:02:35
But I’d had such negative interactions with Siuslaw foresters that I
1:02:41
just didn’t go out of my way to rub elbows with them very much.
1:02:49
It sounds to me from what you’ve said, that there was somehow a change
1:02:53
from your earlier work in the 1960’s.
1:02:56
We didn’t talk too much about this kind of experience.
1:02:59
Was there something that you see as changing the climate there, or why
1:03:03
might that have become more important?
1:03:08
Early on in my mycorrhizae studies, we had the idea,
1:03:15
since there are so many different mycorrhizal fungi, that each one has
1:03:20
different physiological capabilities, that one should could select fungi
1:03:26
adapted to its planting site.
1:03:28
Just like one uses the right seed source to grow seedlings in the nursery.
1:03:35
Select fungi from the planting site, inoculate those on the nursery seedlings,
1:03:39
so that when the seedlings get planted out they have the mycorrhizal system ready to
1:03:44
go, and have a better chance to establish.
1:03:48
It was a great idea, but it took us about five years to conclude it
1:03:56
just wasn’t going to work, because
1:04:02
the fungi that naturally occupied the nursery were so aggressive there, they
1:04:07
just out-competed the introduced one and antagonized anything we tried to introduce
1:04:15
into the nursery.
1:04:17
That was in the early 80’s, and by 1985 or so, Randy Molina, who was
1:04:26
in my project, Mike Castellano and
1:04:30
I, decided
1:04:33
we needed to shift our focus, learn more about the ecology of mycorrhizal
1:04:40
fungi, how to maintain the mycorrhizal potential of the sites being clear-cut,
1:04:50
and how to modify practices so that there would be healthier soil biology.
1:04:59
So
1:05:05
we started.
1:05:08
We got away from the nursery inoculation thing and went more
1:05:12
into the fungal ecology thing.
1:05:17
About that time, I took early retirement from the Forest Service and
1:05:23
continued on the OSU faculty here, with Randy [Molina] providing me with office
1:05:29
and lab space, which he does to this day.
1:05:33
So, we have the university and the Forest Service group here, the
1:05:38
“Soil Mycology Team” as we term it.
1:05:42
We pay very little attention to who works for whom, that’s just a matter of who
1:05:46
pays your salary, but we’re really an integrated group working towards common
1:05:53
goals, and trying to work together.
1:05:56
Actually, that makes a point I was interested in while you were working
1:06:04
at the PNW Station.
1:06:06
You mentioned various university collaborations.
1:06:07
What are the origins of that kind of interaction in your case?
1:06:16
When I got here in 1965, this wing of the lab was “the lab.” The
1:06:24
other parts hadn’t been built yet.
1:06:27
And the university, the
1:06:32
Forest Science Department [OSU-COF] people, were over in
1:06:34
the Forest Research Lab on Western
1:06:39
[Blvd.] . Aside from knowing those folks, and getting together once
1:06:43
in awhile at meetings or something, there was very little interaction.
1:06:49
Then the lab was expanded here [Forest Service FSL] , the middle wing was
1:06:54
built, the west wing was built.
1:06:57
We had what was, if not the largest, certainly among the larger facilities
1:07:03
for forest research, in the world.
1:07:06
Unfortunately, at the time we got all this space and wonderful facilities,
1:07:12
our budget started getting cut.
1:07:16
It was getting to the point where nobody could afford the lab space.
1:07:21
It was putting us all out
1:07:25
of business, using
1:07:28
up our operating money.
1:07:28
There were even some reductions in the work force going on.
1:07:30
So, while the lab building was expanding, the staff was contracting.
1:07:35
Now, when would that be roughly?
1:07:39
Late 70’s or early 80’s, as I recall.
1:07:45
Okay.
1:07:45
The PNW Station decided they had to rent out some of the space to help
1:07:52
pay for the building’s overhead costs, because it was just killing them.
1:07:57
And about that time, the Department of Forest Science was bursting at the
1:08:02
seams, and so OSU rented a lot of space in this lab for Forest Science faculty.
1:08:14
That’s the time when we started really having a lot of PNW-OSU interaction.
1:08:20
It’s just amazing to me that two buildings can be side-by-side, but,
1:08:28
like over in Peavy Hall, I hardly ever see any of the people there.
1:08:33
They stay there and I stay here.
1:08:35
But now, I’m bumping into Forest Science [OSU] people all the time,
1:08:39
and they’re bumping into Forest Service people all the time.
1:08:41
In addition, the PNW
1:08:48
researchers are pretty routinely given courtesy faculty appointments
1:08:53
[OSU] , and that’s helped a lot too, because it put us in a position of
1:08:59
being able to accept graduate students, for example, and be much more involved
1:09:05
with the College of Forestry [OSU]
1:09:07
. Now, is that something new that started in the 70’s?
1:09:11
When did that happen?
1:09:15
It was certainly building in the 70’s.
1:09:16
I’m sure it started before I got
1:09:23
here in ‘65.
1:09:24
But the Department of Forest Science was pretty small in ’65, and the PNW Station
1:09:31
was growing, but still not all that big.
1:09:34
All of us were in this one wing [now three] here.
1:09:39
As both organizations grew and these courtesy OSU appointments were given
1:09:44
to PNW researchers, and there were graduate students, which involved us
1:09:49
in the faculty meetings and so forth, I think both organizations fostered this
1:09:57
kind of interaction and integration.
1:10:01
Then John Gordon, who was department chairman of Forest Science, was just
1:10:07
a wonderful person and loved to see collaboration between organizations.
1:10:12
Then John went to Yale, and Bob Tarrant was
1:10:21
employed as acting department chairman while they conducted
1:10:24
a search for a new chair.
1:10:25
He’d retired from the PNW Station
1:10:29
and moved down here.
1:10:32
I think it was about a year that he was acting department chairman while
1:10:35
they were recruiting someone new, who turned out to be Logan Norris.
1:10:42
Tarrant and Logan both had been PNW employees, and Logan was here
1:10:46
as project leader [leader of a Forest Service research group, one
1:10:46
responsible for watershed studies at the Andrews Forest] . So,
1:10:50
we had a PNW person becoming department chairman, and with
1:10:59
as much or more enthusiasm than
1:11:03
John Gordon , to promote interactions and involvement of each group with the other.
1:11:11
There’s been a very positive direction there, not only from the
1:11:17
people themselves, where if you don’t have it from the researcher,
1:11:21
no matter what an administrator says, it’s not going to happen.
1:11:24
But Logan had the researchers interested to do that.
1:11:28
Collaboration actively encouraged by the department chairman and the PNW
1:11:32
people, makes a really nice organization.
1:11:36
So, from what you’re saying, it sounds like a combination of
1:11:40
departmental-level encouragement, Station-level [PNW] need, and the
1:11:46
specific geography of the lab here.
1:11:50
Right.
1:11:50
And the physical geography is much more important than I ever would have guessed.
1:11:57
Just the layout of the building, or the fact you were brought into the building?
1:12:00
Well, you meet each other in the mail room or walking down the hall, and
1:12:03
would say, “Oh, hi Kermit [Cromack] . By the way, I just saw something
1:12:07
I thought you’d be interested in.
1:12:10
Let’s talk about it.”
1:12:14
That sort of thing.
1:12:14
Also, having students, because then we have a graduate student who has
1:12:19
his or her program committee, and that will involve various people in the
1:12:25
department, and also the Forest Service.
1:12:28
So, just a lot of opportunities for interaction and [opportunity
1:12:31
for] identifying mutual interests.
1:12:33
That was my next question.
1:12:36
What is the degree of involvement of Oregon State University
1:12:39
students in your work?
1:12:40
Especially your work on the Andrews, but in general terms also.
1:12:43
Oh, students do all my work.
1:12:44
[Chuckle] I just have
1:12:47
the fun!
1:12:47
Now, has that always been the case?
1:12:50
I’ve had students since
1:12:54
I got my first doctoral student somewhere around 1969
1:13:01
or 1970, and I’ve had students ever since, sometimes too many.
1:13:05
There was one
1:13:10
time I had 12.
1:13:12
But, yeah, graduate students are a very important part of our PNW research here.
1:13:21
Randy Molina, for example, is team leader for soil microbiology from the PNW.
1:13:32
He has one student and one post-doc.
1:13:39
I’ve got three students right now
1:13:45
working on their research and writing.
1:13:47
One’s completed [recording fades…thesis/dissertation ?] They add
1:13:50
vitality and enthusiasm and creativity to the group, and they’re willing
1:13:57
to work hard for little pay.
1:14:03
The students that you have, it sounds like they’re doctoral students?
1:14:07
A few masters, but mostly doctoral.
1:14:09
Okay.
1:14:10
Do they do much work on the Andrews themselves?
1:14:15
Bob Fogel, who was my Ph.D. student, and then was around for a couple,
1:14:19
three years as a post-doc, was
1:14:25
involved
1:14:29
with the IBP and projects that were on the Andrews.
1:14:30
Dan Luoma, who is now assistant professor in forest science, did his
1:14:37
doctoral work totally on the Andrews.
1:14:41
So, he might also be someone you want to talk with.
1:14:44
This was done
1:14:48
around the end of the 1980’s, and his thesis was
1:14:59
published in ‘92 or something like that.
1:14:59
Luoma is L-u-o-m-a?
1:15:00
Right.
1:15:01
Okay.
1:15:04
What was that on?
1:15:05
It’s on
1:15:08
comparison of
1:15:12
mature versus old growth
1:15:17
and
1:15:21
moderate versus dry sites for production of truffles, native
1:15:27
Pacific Northwest truffles.
1:15:33
My understanding from Martha Brooks is that you’re also
1:15:36
president of the Truffle Society?
1:15:38
I’m scientific advisor for the North American Truffle Society.
1:15:43
When they organized themselves, I said I’d do that, but I
1:15:47
didn’t want to be an officer.
1:15:52
Is that a kind of activity you’ve been involved in frequently in your career?
1:15:56
Oh yeah.
1:15:57
That’s been going on for twenty years or more.
1:16:01
And it came as a result of Tony Walters, who was teaching a mushroom identification
1:16:06
course for Linn-Benton Community College.
1:16:07
He asked me if I would come and give a lecture on truffles, which I did.
1:16:14
It was a good group, and most of them were adult and continuing students
1:16:22
. Then he came back a few weeks later and said, “You know, people were
1:16:28
so excited about your talk that
1:16:32
we decided we’d like to continue some involvement with truffles,
1:16:37
even after the class is done.”
1:16:40
So, we thought we might form a “truffling society,” if there wasn’t one already.
1:16:44
Tony had it all lined up and organized, with goals that would be scientific and
1:16:47
culinary both, and it took off from there.
1:16:57
They’ve been a valuable
1:17:01
resource.
1:17:01
That group must have found well over fifty new species of
1:17:07
truffles since they’ve organized.
1:17:09
When was that organized?
1:17:11
Well, let
1:17:19
me
1:17:22
see.
1:17:22
The first thing
1:17:32
would be
1:17:37
for me to
1:17:40
get their newsletter for you.
1:17:42
I guess, I don’t have any left.
1:17:42
[Looking for copy in office.]
1:17:42
If
1:17:45
you find
1:17:48
one, you can just drop it in my mailbox right over here.
1:17:51
Oh, okay.
1:17:52
Wait a minute.
1:17:55
1978
1:17:56
. Apparent break in recording/transcription leaves gap in narrative and subjects.
1:18:18
[Name?]
1:18:23
set that up it sounds like.
1:18:24
Had he known you from somewhere before?
1:18:27
Nope.
1:18:28
Just by reputation?
1:18:30
Yeah.
1:18:30
He heard about my work with truffles and invited me to
1:18:36
give my lecture to the class.
1:18:38
You’re
1:18:41
probably wondering how long this is going to go on.
1:18:42
[Laughter] We’re almost done if you’re worried.
1:18:45
Okay.
1:18:46
But, I had two more things I wanted to address before we’re through.
1:18:49
The first one is that I understand that you’ve done quite a bit of work in
1:18:55
international research, with international groups, and things like that.
1:19:00
I wondered if you could give me some examples of collaborations,
1:19:03
and any links to the Andrews.
1:19:09
Well, the Ogawa case would be one.
1:19:12
He came over, maybe funded in part by IBP and part by the
1:19:15
Japanese government, but he
1:19:21
was here for a year.
1:19:24
But even before that,
1:19:28
our group had developed
1:19:32
a fairly good reputation internationally for our research on mycorrhizae.
1:19:38
We’d have people liking to see if they could come and
1:19:45
spend time here on a post-doc.
1:19:48
We never had money for that, but we said sure, if you can put up the money.
1:19:54
They’d come here for training, six months, a year, or whatever.
1:19:57
So, we had
1:20:00
researchers from Switzerland, Canada, France, Germany; several from Germany.
1:20:07
We’ve had four now from Sweden,
1:20:14
also some from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, a couple from China, one
1:20:20
from Thailand, several Australians and New Zealanders, and also
1:20:28
from Spain and Italy.
1:20:30
A really tremendous variety of people, and we almost always have
1:20:34
some kind of foreign post-doc here either on a post-doc or a sabbatical.
1:20:40
Right now, we have a Norwegian mycologist.
1:20:44
So, people are attracted here by the reputation of the group.
1:20:46
You don’t go out and recruit them?
1:20:48
Right.
1:20:49
We’ve never gone out to recruit them because we never had, and rarely,
1:20:53
have we had money to do that.
1:20:57
It’s been a tremendous benefit to us, because we always learn as much from them
1:21:02
as they learn from us, if not in terms of the scientific aspects, then culturally
1:21:09
or whatever, and they make good contacts.
1:21:12
In 1967,
1:21:18
I was given a year’s sabbatical by the PNW Station.
1:21:24
I was told that this was the first time any Forest Service researcher has had
1:21:30
a sabbatical, and I did it in Italy.
1:21:36
And I was told, [laughter] it was the first time any Forest Service researcher
1:21:40
had spent a year abroad on salary.
1:21:45
Why Italy?
1:21:48
Because, by that time I’d gotten really involved in
1:21:53
truffles and false truffles, and mycorrhizal fungi and important organisms
1:21:59
in our forest, and because they are a food for the animals and so forth
1:22:08
and have important mycorrhizal fungi.
1:22:08
Italy was probably the best place to go study taxonomy of these fungi.
1:22:13
At that time, the PNW
1:22:19
had a little bit different organization.
1:22:21
My assistant director was Bob Furniss, an entomologist.
1:22:29
Bob was a great believer in international collaboration and in the
1:22:35
training of scientists to go abroad.
1:22:39
So, he and I talked about this, and he said, “This would be a great thing
1:22:43
to do. Maybe we can get something started.” So, he supported it.
1:22:48
I got approved by the director and by the Washington office to do this,
1:22:56
with the proviso I pay for transportation costs myself.
1:23:03
So, I wrote up a couple of grant applications and was fortunate
1:23:07
enough to get funds to pay my travel.
1:23:11
Then, while I was in Italy, Bob Furniss retired and was replaced by
1:23:17
Ken Wright, also an entomologist.
1:23:20
After a while, Ken wrote to me and said, “Jim, we haven’t had
1:23:23
any travel claims from you.
1:23:26
Don’t let them pile up, send them in, let’s say, monthly.” I responded
1:23:28
that the agreement for the sabbatical was I’d pay for the travel expenses.
1:23:28
He replied, “Oh, I don’t think that’s necessary.” I did use
1:23:32
my grants to pay for my
1:23:38
round-trip ticket Portland to Italy.
1:23:39
I had really good support from my supervisors.
1:23:44
And
1:23:48
that set a precedent that has been exercised in stations all over the
1:23:53
country by many, many scientists since.
1:23:56
That’s kind of a nice accomplishment, too, but it’s really Bob Furniss
1:24:02
and Ken Wright’s accomplishment as much as mine, because
1:24:08
without their support it would have been dead in the water.
1:24:08
Anyhow, we have these people come here as post-docs or on sabbatical, and
1:24:13
then, as in the case of the Swedish professor Torgny Unestam, he wanted
1:24:20
some of his students to come here.
1:24:23
Unlike the United States, most countries seem to
1:24:29
make funds available fairly often for students to study abroad.
1:24:34
They consider that an important part of
1:24:41
the educational experience, and some countries like
1:24:46
Finland, for example,
1:24:51
require their students to go abroad for at least one year for study in forestry.
1:24:59
So, we have those people coming here, and then they develop joint
1:25:06
interests with ours, they go back home, and we continue collaboration.
1:25:11
We had a guy from Australia come around 1970.
1:25:14
He spent a year here.
1:25:16
He and I have been working together ever since.
1:25:19
Who’s that?
1:25:23
Nick Malajczuk.
1:25:27
M-a-l-a-j-c-z-u-k, from CSIRO in Perth.
1:25:35
He got a big grant that brought me and Mike [Castellano] over to Australia
1:25:42
at least half a dozen times, working with the mycorrhizae truffle fungi.
1:25:51
West Australia then?
1:25:51
Actually, tropical Australia was his program.
1:25:54
We did go to Western Australia, too.
1:25:57
And then, partly because of that work, we had another Australian, Andrew Claridge,
1:26:03
ask me to be on his thesis committee at the Australia National University
1:26:06
as external examiner, and then, at the Australian National University.
1:26:11
After Andrew earned his Ph.D. he applied for and got a Fulbright Fellowship to come
1:26:14
here, and he spent the year here in 1994.
1:26:17
Since then, he got a big Australian grant, so I’ve been over there
1:26:21
four times working with him.
1:26:23
So, it snowballs.
1:26:28
We have a good group here and they’re open to visitors, and one of our
1:26:31
policies has always been to share all information with anybody who asks for it.
1:26:39
And I know Andrew told me it was just like a breath of fresh air to come
1:26:46
here, because any questions he’d ask of any of our group, he knew he’d get
1:26:51
as complete an answer as anybody had.
1:26:54
Nobody was keeping anything hidden.
1:26:58
And people in general just seem to have appreciated the research atmosphere in
1:27:07
the group here [HJA]
1:27:12
. Several people told me that they made a cautious decision about the
1:27:15
time the NSF grant picked to go with post-docs rather than graduate students.
1:27:21
Sounds
1:27:24
like in your group here, that you dealt mainly with a wide
1:27:29
diversity of kinds of people?
1:27:33
Well, the post-doc can work full-time under our system, but
1:27:37
a graduate student has to take so much coursework the first two years.
1:27:41
Basically, they can only barely get started on their research.
1:27:47
So, if you have a post-doc, they can hit the ground running and they don’t have
1:27:50
all these other requirements to meet.
1:27:52
On the other hand, the post-docs are twice as expensive or more, so
1:27:58
I like to have a mix.
1:28:01
Well, I promised I only had two more, and I’ve got more than that.
1:28:06
I wasn’t keeping track.
1:28:08
I do have one question here, the last one I want to get in,
1:28:10
and make sure I don’t forget.
1:28:12
I was wondering if you could describe
1:28:16
some about
1:28:22
your perception of the way the Andrews group is governed.
1:28:26
How much input do you have as someone who’s kind of working with
1:28:29
people, but not directly involved in the running of that program?
1:28:32
How much input can you have or have you had, in decisions about various studies,
1:28:37
and what’s it like to be a specialist?
1:28:39
I’ve never felt inhibited, but I’ve never had that much
1:28:43
occasion to need to have input.
1:28:47
I know any time I want, I can call up Art McKee [Andrews Forest Director]
1:28:49
or whoever, and if I have an ax to grind, he’ll let me grind it and
1:28:57
do his best to see that my needs are met, and that’s fine with me.
1:29:02
I’m just happy how things go.
1:29:06
We use the Andrews facilities down there, off and on, now.
1:29:09
We’ve had some project or group retreats down there.
1:29:12
We’ve had
1:29:15
“Westwide Fungus Forays,” which are a gathering of mycologists in the western
1:29:22
states, from British Columbia to San Diego State, and as far east as Idaho
1:29:28
and Utah. We’ve had that at the Andrews.
1:29:32
It’s just a really nice facility for that sort of thing.
1:29:35
Since they built that headquarters facility there in the early 90’s?
1:29:40
Yes.
1:29:42
The facilities are really nice for lots of kinds of things.
1:29:45
Of course, they’re very heavily used during the field season, so it’s a
1:29:51
little bit hard sometimes to get a slot, but for our fieldwork with fungi,
1:29:57
they’re mostly fruiting in late October, November and December, then we always
1:30:02
have easy access to the facilities.
1:30:06
There’s one other thing I wanted to mention.
1:30:08
One
1:30:12
time, I suppose in
1:30:18
the 70’s, the Forest Service National Research Advisory
1:30:24
Committee met at the Andrews.
1:30:30
This included, as
1:30:39
I recall, Chief [Richard] McArdle [U.S. Forest Service] at the time.
1:30:39
I know
1:30:42
the Deputy Chief for Research at the time, Les Harper, was there, plus eminences
1:30:47
in forestry from academic and industrial sources that were on the Chief’s
1:30:52
Advisory Committee for Research.
1:30:56
Bob Tarrant and I were asked by the station [PNW] directors to set up the tour
1:31:01
of the Andrews and other destinations.
1:31:05
They didn’t have the facilities at the Andrews at the time to host something
1:31:09
like that, but we made good use of the various lodges along the McKenzie River,
1:31:15
other picturesque places and so forth.
1:31:19
Where did you put them up?
1:31:22
Well, I can’t remember the name of the place, but there was
1:31:26
a sort of quasi-rustic lodge.
1:31:31
I think it was upriver from Blue River, as I recall.
1:31:37
Bob Tarrant might remember.
1:31:39
Have you interviewed him by the way?
1:31:40
Yeah, I have.
1:31:42
This is ringing a bell, because I’ve been going through some documents
1:31:45
over in the university archives [OSU] relating to research forests, and
1:31:50
one of the recommendations that came out of that advisory committee in
1:31:57
relations to that site, was that better facilities were needed at the Andrews.
1:31:59
It’s a must read
1:32:00
. I would imagine.
1:32:01
That’s why I was looking at it, thinking this was one of the issues
1:32:03
they were talking about; facilities.
1:32:05
The [PNW] station put together a sort of souvenir photograph
1:32:07
album for participants, and I got one of those which I ran across
1:32:19
in my trunk at home not long ago.
1:32:24
If you like, I can see if I can find it again.
1:32:27
[Laughter] I don’t know what I did with it.
1:32:28
I know I kept it, because I thought, “Well, this is kind of cool.
1:32:31
I’d forgotten all about that.”
1:32:32
That’s from that group when they were there?
1:32:33
Yeah.
1:32:34
Yeah, I’d like to see that.
1:32:35
Either that or copies of some of the photos.
1:32:54
As I understand it from this work I’ve been doing, Oregon is the facility
1:32:58
[was a discussion point] with that advisory committee by the then [PNW]
1:33:03
station directors, and that you and Tarrant had put this itinerary together
1:33:10
. Well, Bob was responsible for it, but since I worked
1:33:14
for him, I was part of that.
1:33:17
That was fun and we had a hell of a good time.
1:33:19
We had to go up and down the McKenzie checking out all of
1:33:22
the facilities, trying the food.
1:33:25
They had a bus which they wanted to take over McKenzie Pass.
1:33:31
That was quite an adventure in itself, getting a bus around
1:33:36
some of those hairpin curves.
1:33:38
I drove a guide car, so I could go ahead with flashing lights and
1:33:43
the bus would go on like that, to get around some of the curves.
1:33:48
Yeah, I had heck of a time on that.
1:33:50
I think I would have rather been in the guide car than
1:33:57
on
1:34:00
the bus.
1:34:00
[Laughter]
1:34:00
And it would be my guess that Les Harper, kind of a curmudgeonly guy, and he
1:34:10
was I think from Vermont, very taciturn,
1:34:17
somewhat dour looking and intimidating , wanted to go.
1:34:20
But he had to leave early and I drove him to the Eugene airport.
1:34:24
On the
1:34:27
trip to the airport, I found out he was a really nice person.
1:34:33
I was just a young kid, a researcher, and he treated me like a real researcher.
1:34:43
In the course of that, I took advantage of asking him some things about Forest
1:34:48
Service research, and he was very emphatic that the Forest Service had
1:34:59
to change from it’s old habits of going out and testing this, that, and other
1:35:06
forestry practices, for the national forests, to change from that to getting
1:35:12
into a fundamental understanding of how forests work and operate.
1:35:16
I suspect he was a very strong proponent of the experimental
1:35:24
forest concept for that reason.
1:35:31
The phrase was at the time, making a lot of our research “narrower and deeper,”
1:35:38
and really try to understand how these systems work . It later occurred to
1:35:41
me that Dr. Harper would have been the Washington office administrator who
1:35:42
approved my proposal for a year in Italy.
1:35:42
That was the early, must be the early 70’s, right?
1:35:45
I think so.
1:35:47
Well, no,
1:35:50
actually it would have been the early ‘60’s, because it was
1:35:52
before I came to Corvallis in ‘65.
1:35:54
It might have been ‘62, ‘63, ’64, or something like that.
1:35:55
So,
1:36:01
that’s not connected with
1:36:05
the advisory committee ? [For H.J. Andrews EF]
1:36:07
The advisory committee was before I came to Corvallis in ‘65.
1:36:13
Well, it’s interesting that he would be making that argument at that point.
1:36:15
Yeah, it is.
1:36:15
That’s pretty early, that I know.
1:36:21
Well, that’s really it.
1:36:23
I don’t want to keep you here all afternoon.
1:36:27
One question that I asked before, maybe that I asked in a different way.
1:36:31
There’s
1:36:34
some advantages and disadvantages in working in a group context, you know,
1:36:39
working with other people and cooperating.
1:36:42
I was curious; the Andrews group is made up of a lot of people
1:36:46
with overlapping interests.
1:36:49
My understanding is that their research is a little bit more specialized and focused
1:36:55
? I think when Ogawa and I were doing the coarse woody debris study, is when I had
1:37:03
maximum interaction with other people.
1:37:06
I know Jim Sedell, for example,
1:37:11
and the role of fallen trees and so forth, in streams and wetlands.
1:37:20
A guy whose name I forget now, who was down at the marine science center,
1:37:21
was focused on the role of coarse woody debris in estuaries and beaches
1:37:31
. It is true that our studies have tended to be
1:37:39
rather specialized in their focus, until Chris Maser and I published
1:37:47
these papers about the use of truffles as food by small mammals.
1:37:55
And amongst other things, our data indicated that the
1:37:59
northern flying squirrel,
1:38:03
subsisted primarily on truffles.
1:38:06
Now, they will consume some other stuff, but throughout the year,
1:38:09
probably 80% of its diet is truffles.
1:38:13
Then comes the northern spotted owl,
1:38:18
whose major prey from the “Willamette divide” north, is
1:38:25
the northern flying squirrel.
1:38:26
So, all of a sudden, truffles are discovered to be an important
1:38:31
part of the food web for the owl.
1:38:35
We have this neat interacting system, where the trees have got
1:38:42
to form mycorrhizae to get enough nutrients and moisture from the soil.
1:38:47
And many of the mycorrhizae fungi are truffle-formers, and the fungus needs
1:38:53
the tree as it’s source of energy, the squirrel needs the fungus as its food,
1:38:59
and the truffle spores are disbursed by the animals that eat them, and the
1:39:04
spores go through the digestive tract, and where they’re excreted, then there
1:39:07
are little packages of spore inoculum that get dispersed through the soil.
1:39:12
The owls need the squirrels, and they need the trees for nesting and so forth, so you
1:39:18
have this cycle of interacting organisms, and that’s just the macro aspect.
1:39:24
C.Y. Li determined that there are free-living nitrogen fixers
1:39:29
associated with mychorrizal fungi, including the fruiting bodies.
1:39:34
He’s tracked these through the digestive tract of the
1:39:36
squirrels that eat the truffles.
1:39:39
When the truffle spores are being dispersed by the animals, they’re also
1:39:44
dispersing the nitrogen-fixing fungi.
1:39:46
So, there’s just all kinds of stuff going on there.
1:39:52
That, got us into collaboration with other specialists, particularly
1:40:00
Andy Carey’s group at Olympia.
1:40:02
So, I had a graduate student, Wes Colgan III, just successfully defend
1:40:06
his thesis a couple of months ago.
1:40:09
He looked at truffle crop productivity over time and seasons at Fort Lewis,
1:40:19
in conjunction with Andy Carey’s group
1:40:26
there.
1:40:27
They were trapping and tagging squirrels and chipmunks, and every
1:40:32
time they’d have one of these animals captive, they’d squeeze a few poops
1:40:39
out, so we got little vials of poops to analyze for truffle spores.
1:40:43
It’s been a lot of fun to have that kind of interaction.
1:40:46
The same sort of thing was happening at the DEMO project down
1:40:56
on the Umpqua.
1:40:56
It’s interesting to me, you were talking about how if you have to use
1:41:00
the Andrews for your study site, you don’t have any problem going down there.
1:41:04
I’m just curious, is there some trigger or mechanism, or what kinds
1:41:08
of things lead them to come and draw you into those kinds of studies?
1:41:11
Is
1:41:16
it just the proximity of being in daily contact with these people, or do they
1:41:21
actively seek you out on some issues?
1:41:23
Some of both.
1:41:24
One of the things that IBP demonstrated, at least to the
1:41:30
National Science Foundation, was that
1:41:34
one of the major black holes in our knowledge was of below-ground
1:41:40
processes and organisms.
1:41:44
So, they have put over the years, some special emphasis on studies
1:41:50
of what’s happening below ground.
1:41:54
Insofar as we can be helpful to other groups in that, we’re very
1:41:59
open to that kind of collaboration.
1:42:04
So, it’s kind of a gradually evolving process?
1:42:06
Yeah.
1:42:08
Probably a lot of it, again, is just the kind of contact we have; in the
1:42:14
same building instead of two buildings with a parking lot between them.
1:42:19
I’m a little bit concerned with these new buildings going up here.
1:42:25
It’s going to take more energy to maintain these contacts than it does at the moment.
1:42:29
Are people going to
1:42:32
be moving out of this building into that one?
1:42:33
Oh, yeah, a lot.
1:42:36
Probably two-thirds of the Department of Forest Science.
1:42:40
That would require more formalized structures, if you want that to continue?
1:42:43
However it’s
1:42:45
done, it takes energy and time.
1:42:49
Because, if you don’t see people more or less spontaneously on
1:42:53
a regular basis, then you have to put effort into seeing them.
1:42:57
Everybody has far more to do than they can realistically handle.
1:43:01
“Oh, I really want to go over there and talk with so and so, but I’ve
1:43:06
got this thing to get out today and tomorrow, and I have to do this lab
1:43:10
work and stuff next week.” Well next week, it’s the same thing, so you
1:43:13
really have to make an effort to do it.
1:43:18
We may have to formalize that in some way in the sense of agreeing with people we
1:43:26
want to especially keep in touch with.
1:43:30
“Let’s say every third Thursday of the month, we’ll have lunch together,
1:43:34
or sit down for an hour or two in the afternoon and update each other.” If
1:43:41
it’s not scheduled that way, it’s not going to happen. I’m sure of that.
1:43:44
Well, it’s like you’re talking about the same thing that our group does, where they
1:43:46
meet [regularly] . Everybody knows it’s to be on that day, and they plan on it.
1:43:46
Yeah, right.
1:43:46
Well, this has been real useful to me, because, first
1:43:52
of all, I was not aware that Bob Tarrant was the acting chair.
1:43:58
I’d known he was on the faculty.
1:44:03
Who would you recommend I talk to for the university perspective on that period?
1:44:15
When Bob was
1:44:15
-- ? -- when he was brought in as acting chair, and when the university began to place
1:44:20
faculty in the Forestry Science Lab.
1:44:25
Well, I suppose most any of the faculty that were here at the time.
1:44:31
Dave Perry would certainly be a good person.
1:44:34
I’m in his office.
1:44:35
I should probably get a hold of him.
1:44:37
Oh, yeah.
1:44:37
You can slip over to Hawaii on official business.
1:44:42
Mike
1:44:44
Newton would be another, and Joe Zaerr.
1:44:46
Joe?
1:44:46
Joe Zaerr, I mean.
1:44:46
Okay.
1:44:46
And there
1:44:49
are others I’m
1:44:53
sure, but those are the three that come to mind.
1:44:55
Joe might be among the better ones, because
1:45:04
I guess he’s retired more or less now, but
1:45:11
his title is likely associate department chairman for Logan [Norris] , and
1:45:15
I think he probably was very much involved in helping Bob as well.
1:45:27
You still have Bob here?
1:45:28
Uh-huh.
1:45:28
I think he’s over in his office right now.
1:45:30
Well, I think I’ve probably taken up enough of your time here.
1:45:33
Forgive me.
1:45:34
I don’t envy you having to sort the meat out from the garbage here, but so it goes.
1:45:39
No, this has been real helpful.
1:45:40
I guess that historians are used to that.
1:45:44
Yeah.
1:45:44
I like to tell people when I do my work, I think I use maybe two
1:45:50
percent of the research notes that I
1:45:54
wind up taking.
1:45:55
You are probably familiar with that, too.
1:45:56
I appreciate your time.
