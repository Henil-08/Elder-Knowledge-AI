00:01
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State
00:05
University College of Forestry.
00:07
It is November 14,
00:12
2016.
00:12
I am at the Forest Sciences Laboratory just south of Olympia, Washington,
00:18
U.S. Forest Service facility, and I am here doing an oral history with Martin
00:24
G. Raphael, Ph.D., Emeritus Senior Scientist, Wildlife Ecology Team, 31
00:29
years with the U.S. Forest Service.
00:31
We are doing an oral history today focused on the Northwest Forest
00:35
Plan which is part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project.
00:38
We will also be talking about Marty and his career, kind of
00:44
biographically-centered; how he got into science, how he got interested in
00:47
nature, but also how he became a wildlife biologist and how that applies to the
00:54
Northwest Forest Plan and his specialty regarding the Forest Plan, which is the
00:58
marbled murrelet, one of the important endangered species that were listed
01:03
and included in that particular plan.
01:04
So, good morning, Marty?
01:06
Good morning, good to be here.
01:08
Thank you for meeting with me.
01:09
And I will basically start out like I do with all interviews.
01:13
Basically, where were you born and raised?
01:16
Well, I was born in Denver, Colorado, moved to California when I was seven.
01:21
My dad was an engineer and got a job at UC-Berkeley on the faculty, so we
01:27
moved to California, and I grew up in the Bay Area of California, stayed there
01:32
through high school, and went to my first round of college at Sacramento State,
01:37
which is not too far from the Bay Area.
01:41
At that time, I had no idea what I was going to be doing.
01:45
I thought maybe I should be an engineer just like my dad.
01:47
But it turned out, I didn’t really enjoy that.
01:52
Ended up graduating in social sciences, because I had changed majors like five
01:58
times while I was at Sacramento State.
02:01
Not knowing what I wanted to do, I kept trying different things.
02:04
Social sciences were a way to combine units from lots of different things.
02:09
Then, I worked in a steel mill for several years, and in the process of doing that,
02:13
the environmental movement came about.
02:16
There was the first Earth Day, I got excited about the environment, and my
02:21
wife said, “You should go back to school and study ecology.” I thought, “Oh,
02:25
I can’t do that.” And she said, “You should try it.” So, I applied to Berkeley
02:30
and was accepted in a new program they had called “Conservation and Natural
02:34
Resources.” So, I went back to Berkeley and started over essentially, and got
02:39
a second bachelors while I was there.
02:41
Then, while I was there, I got involved with a professor in the entomology
02:48
department named Donald Dahlsten.
02:50
He was involved in biological control of injurious forest insects, and
02:55
one of those biological controls was cavity-nesting birds, who eat
03:00
a lot of bark beetles and things.
03:02
Dr. Dahlsten was saying at the time that these cavity-nesting birds depended on
03:08
dead trees, dead trees were important for wildlife, and I got interested in that.
03:11
And so, after working with him for three years in his lab after I got my second
03:17
bachelor’s, I applied for grad school at Berkeley, and then started that
03:23
study with cavity-nesting birds there.
03:28
M y
03:34
first research project was on relationships between snags, dead trees
03:40
and cavity-nesting birds, all under the mentorship of this Professor Dahlsten.
03:49
I sort of put him as the guy responsible for getting me into
03:53
this field in the first place.
03:54
Now, were you working in coastal areas or the Sierra area?
03:57
Sierra.
03:58
On which slope?
04:00
On the east side.
04:00
My graduate work was just north of Lake Tahoe on the east side of
04:05
the Sierra Nevada in the Truckee area, a really beautiful spot.
04:11
Okay, right by Squaw Valley and all that jazz?
04:13
Yeah, just north of there.
04:15
So, I went to this place called Sagehen Creek Field Station, and they had
04:19
these permanent plots that had been set up and had been studied right
04:24
after a big fire had come through.
04:27
There was an opportunity to resurvey those plots and look at birds in the area
04:32
that had been burned, and compare that with areas where it had not been burned.
04:36
And my study was to look at the numbers of dead trees that were still on these
04:42
plots, and then to follow them over time to see at what rate they were
04:46
falling, or whether new ones were coming on-line, and how that affected the birds.
04:50
So, I did that for several years and ended up getting a Ph.D.
04:55
From Berkeley also?
04:56
From Berkeley, yeah.
04:58
So that was 1980 by the time that happened.
05:01
I went back to school in 1972.
05:04
After your first bachelors?
05:05
After my first, right.
05:06
Sacramento State.
05:08
The Hornets?
05:09
Right?
05:09
Yes.
05:10
I got that degree in 1968, and worked in the steel mill like I said.
05:15
Then I went back to school in ’72, graduated in ’74, then started in ’76.
05:26
On your Ph.D.
05:27
Yeah.
05:28
So, going back a little further,
05:31
were you more or less an urban kid, or did you have experiences out in nature
05:37
when you were young, that made an impact that perhaps you reconnected with?
05:41
That’s exactly what happened, because I didn’t really realize it
05:44
at the time, but it was always the natural sciences that interested me.
05:48
I loved to go out and go on frog hunts or snake hunts, or check out
05:55
ponds and look for salamanders.
05:57
This would have been like in the East Bay area?
05:59
Yeah.
06:01
We had this little creek in our neighborhood.
06:03
This was in Lafayette, California, which is just over the hill from Berkeley.
06:07
Is that by Concord and Walnut Creek and all that?
06:10
Yeah.
06:10
So, if you go east from the Berkeley area, the first town you get to is Orinda.
06:15
That’s where my wife is from.
06:17
And then Lafayette, then Long Creek, then Pleasant Hill, and then Concord;
06:21
it’s this whole string of communities.
06:23
So, we were in Lafayette and we had this really cool creek that was
06:27
just two blocks away from our house.
06:29
And we’d build rafts and float down the creek, then we’d hunt for
06:36
western pond turtles there, and they’d have hatchlings every year.
06:39
We’d catch these little turtle hatchlings.
06:43
We had just a fantastic time looking for snakes, lizards, whatever it
06:48
was, but it never occurred to me at the time that this would be what I
06:51
would actually study for a living.
06:53
And then, when I went back to school and started in this conservation program,
06:59
I just realized this is what I like.
07:02
And so, where I’d always been kind of a C student in college,
07:06
I started just thriving.
07:08
When I went back to Berkeley, I’d get straight-A’s, and just
07:11
really into what was going on.
07:13
So, it was really fun.
07:15
And I realized, oh, yeah, that’s what I want to do.
07:19
So, do you remember any family vacations where you went to like,
07:26
especially spectacular landscapes or places or that also fed into this love
07:31
of nature in terms of how it applied to your professional development?
07:35
I think so, because my dad used to like to take us on these trips, and I remember
07:40
while we were still living in Denver, so I was probably five years old, we
07:44
went through Bryce Canyon National Park, and I still remember those sandstone,
07:52
sculptured cliffs, and rock formations.
07:56
He would buy me books about dinosaurs, and so, I was one of
08:00
these dinosaur-loving kids, too.
08:03
We took a trip to back east and went to one of the big natural history
08:07
museums there, saw the skeleton of Tyrannosaurus Rex, and I just thought
08:11
that was the coolest thing ever.
08:13
So, there were experiences like that when I was really young, that
08:17
probably made a big difference once I finally settled down.
08:21
Was there a special attraction to birds or ornithology or particular
08:25
biological species, groups or anything?
08:28
No, I really was into snakes and lizards growing up.
08:32
Like a lot of boys.
08:33
Yeah.
08:34
They were the best.
08:35
And I remember catching gopher snakes.
08:37
That was always my favorite.
08:38
One
08:40
key experience.
08:42
My dad knew I was interested in that stuff, so he took me to Berkeley and
08:46
introduced me to Robert Stebbins.
08:47
Robert Stebbins was a herpetologist and was the curator of herpetology
08:53
at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, and he wrote the “Field Guide to
08:57
Western Reptiles and Amphibians.” He took me to his lab, Stebbins showed me
09:03
around, and then released a sidewinder [rattlesnake] on the floor, and had us
09:06
stand up on the museum display cases while this sidewinder was buzzin’ around.
09:11
Then, he actually gave me a king snake that I got to take home, so
09:15
that was just the coolest thing.
09:16
A live king snake?
09:17
Yeah, a live king snake.
09:18
I don’t know why he had that or why he was giving it away, but he gave me
09:23
a king snake and I had it for years.
09:24
As a pet?
09:25
Yeah.
09:28
That was while I was in high school.
09:31
And so, after all that time at Sacramento State, I ended up back at Berkeley, took
09:35
a course from Stebbins called “Natural History of the Vertebrates,” and I
09:39
just thought, “Oh, this is so cool.
09:41
I
09:44
remember this.” And he really liked the little report I did.
09:49
When I was working for Dahlsten, one of his studies was putting up nest
09:52
boxes to study mountain chickadees because the chickadee was another bird
09:56
that fed on these injurious insects.
09:59
So, I was involved with helping to monitor what was going on with these nest boxes.
10:05
You’d run up, put your hand over the opening to the box, and then reach
10:09
in and get the birds and band them.
10:12
That actually started my interest in birds.
10:15
Then, when I went home, I had one of his nest boxes, and I hung it on a tree
10:19
in our back yard when I first went back to school, and the chickadees nested.
10:27
This was a different species of chickadee, it was chestnut-backed,
10:29
instead of mountain.
10:31
It was nesting in there, and I recorded the daily development of the
10:34
nestlings and stuff, and wrote it up for my report for that Stebbins class.
10:40
He gave my report rave reviews.
10:42
They used it as an example in the library for other students
10:47
to look at in succeeding years.
10:51
The feedback I got from doing that just really, it was a big thrill.
10:55
Do you ever remember in your family home or other places, seeing books,
11:01
for instance, at my family home, we had some of the famous Audubon illustrated
11:05
books that stimulated me in birds, not professionally like it did for you?
11:09
But even when I got older as a professional historian, some of
11:13
the famous scientific illustrators, Catesby in the Southeast and Cook’s
11:20
illustrators on his world travels.
11:22
Did you remember those kinds of visions?
11:24
We didn’t have any of that.
11:26
We had engineering books and we had nursing books, because my mom was a nurse.
11:30
And I used to love looking at her nursing books and pictures of diseased
11:33
people and injuries and things.
11:35
I thought that was the coolest thing.
11:36
But no, we didn’t have any kind of natural history books at all, and I never knew
11:42
anything about that until I went back there, you know, started over at Berkeley.
11:46
Then I got into the field guides and going out bird watching.
11:49
Now, when you were doing your doctorate, what were some of the special places
11:54
that you did your work, and what were the aesthetics of the places?
11:58
Well, that Sagehen Creek Field Station was really cool.
12:01
It was a small facility with these tent cabins that you would stay in.
12:06
It had a cook facility and these classes would come in.
12:09
This is the place on the other side of Tahoe, right?
12:11
Right.
12:12
It’s an experimental field station, at that time run by
12:16
the University of California.
12:17
Now, it’s a [U.S.] Forest Service experimental forest,
12:20
so it’s got a different status.
12:21
[University of California Reserve and U.S. Forest Service Experimental Forest
12:21
– Sagehen Station has dual status.]
12:22
Is it on the north side of Tahoe or the east side?
12:24
Well, it’s north, about 10 miles north.
12:30
Close to Mount Rose on the north side of the rim there?
12:33
If you were to take Highway 89 out of Truckee heading north towards
12:38
Sierraville, and then to ultimately Quincy, it’s along that road.
12:43
Not near Mt. Rose, but it’s further up toward the crest.
12:47
It’s closer to Donner Lake and those
12:54
areas.
12:54
Now, what do you make of the contrast between the ecology of both Colorado,
13:01
and also, central-western California, and up here in the Pacific Northwest?
13:09
How would you describe the contrast between those, if you were going
13:12
to talk about your evolution of perceptions of places and ecologies?
13:17
Well, the main thing here is the stature of the trees and the diversity of
13:23
plants, just the whole biomass thing.
13:25
I mean, these forests are so much bigger than anything I’ve experienced in the
13:28
Sierra Nevada, and I spent five years in Laramie, too, before I came out here.
13:34
This place is just amazing, with these gigantic trees and the moss-covered
13:39
limbs, and the epiphytes that are growing all over everything.
13:42
It’s so diverse.
13:45
And then, I wouldn’t say that the bird diversity isn’t greater.
13:50
It’s pretty much the same but, a few different types of things,
13:56
but it’s mostly the nature of the forest that is just so different.
14:01
Even though you lived close to the redwoods, and the sequoias were
14:03
down there in the south-central Sierras, those did not impact you
14:08
like later on, professionally, when you’re in the Northwest, the
14:11
bigness of the forests up here?
14:12
Yeah, because we did go to Sequoia when I was a kid.
14:17
We went hiking and backpacking down there, so I’m sure that made an impression
14:22
on me too, all these huge trees.
14:23
But I lived around the smaller, “normal” kind of trees in the Sierra Nevada,
14:29
and so it made a big difference being up here and being surrounded by these
14:35
cool, moist, huge tree environments.
14:41
You
14:43
were obviously studying the science, but what important management principles or
14:52
concepts in land and natural resource management and conservation, were you
14:57
also exposed to at that time, because you were obviously learning the science
15:02
then, but you became something different as you developed as a professional.
15:06
What did you learn, what were your perceptions, and how would you represent
15:09
your developing beliefs back in your university days, especially graduate
15:13
school, when you were really coming of age intellectually into what you became?
15:17
Well, I was surrounded by a certain sort of the conservation ethic.
15:24
Professor Dahlsten was into biological control.
15:29
That’s different than spraying pesticides.
15:31
They had the typical foresters who were cutting trees and spraying
15:36
insecticides, and then you had the conservationists that were looking
15:39
for ways to manage biodiversity, to look for environmentally friendly
15:44
ways to solve environmental problems.
15:48
That’s the environment that I really grew up in and was looking at, and I was sort
15:52
of surrounded by this conservation ethic.
15:54
That sort has shaped my thinking ever since.
15:59
You brought up Earth Day early in the interview.
16:03
What do you remember about that and just what you thought that meant?
16:09
And did you realize what an earth-shaking paradigm shift it was?
16:13
Or, was it that you just thought it was really cool, and then you
16:15
just followed where that led you in terms of that cultural ethos?
16:20
Yeah, well, I’m not quite sure of the sequence.
16:23
But there’s the famous picture of the earth rising above the
16:26
moon that was taken during that—
16:29
Apollo 8.
16:29
During the Apollo mission.
16:31
And so, the combination of that image of our blue earth, and the fact that
16:36
that’s it, you know, that’s our planet, and then this conservation ethic,
16:43
it just said we’ve got to do what we can to take care of this place.
16:47
Because that was one year [years] before the first Earth Day.
16:50
It was ’68 or ’69 when “Earth Rise” was shot, the name of the famous photo.
16:55
[Taken by Apollo 8 astronauts during mission]
16:56
. Yeah.
16:56
But, I mean, a lot of people had that same thing happen, I believe.
16:59
So I think the combination of those events made me think, well, maybe
17:04
that’s a way that I can contribute.
17:08
We need to take care of this Earth, and Earth Day sort of put
17:11
a focus on that important need.
17:14
And a way to do that is to learn how ecosystems work and to try to study these
17:19
things and see if there’s something I can learn about it and apply to them.
17:22
But, when you were studying the science at Berkeley, did you think
17:26
that you were going to basically be a science/manager or did you think you
17:30
were just going to be a scientist?
17:32
I thought I was going to be some kind of a scientist.
17:34
I didn’t know about management.
17:36
But I was taking those conservation courses, and I was around a guy
17:40
who was involved with managers.
17:42
He started bringing me to meetings of
17:46
the Western Forest Action Council, something like that, looking at ways to
17:51
change the way forests were being managed to take advantage of natural predation
17:57
as opposed to spraying insecticides.
18:01
So, that’s what got me into the idea of applied science, and then maybe
18:05
there’s a way to be a scientist, but doing it in a way that would lend itself
18:10
to solving actual management problems.
18:14
Now, going back even further, reflecting back on the childhood, your adolescence,
18:18
and early professional development in school, do you remember seeing any event
18:24
or practice environmentally, good or bad, that made an impression on you, good or
18:29
bad, like a clear-cut or, like, in Santa Barbara, there was the big oil spill?
18:36
Things like that?
18:38
You know, I can’t think of any big singular event.
18:42
I did go to a big oil spill and treated oiled birds.
18:45
And I’m sure that had an influence.
18:48
There was one just north of San Francisco near Stinson Beach, and a group of
18:54
us went out there and were spreading detergent on the birds and trying to clean
18:58
them up, and I saw the impacts of it.
19:02
When would this have been?
19:04
It was while I was at Berkeley, so it was in the early ‘70s.
19:07
I can’t remember exactly when.
19:09
Was it a tanker that hit ground?
19:11
Yeah.
19:12
Yep.
19:13
Okay, interesting.
19:13
That was one event.
19:16
Then, when traveling with Dahlsten to these different agricultural fields
19:21
where they were spraying insecticides; that had an impression on me for sure.
19:27
And then when we were talking about these forest insects, I just remember he kept
19:33
talking about this idea, well, you can show with insecticides and it kills a
19:37
lot of insects, but you can’t show that it’s having an impact on survival of the
19:43
trees, and that’s what really counts.
19:45
That always made a big impression on me that these pesticide advocates would say,
19:51
“Oh, look at all the insects we killed,” but they can’t show you what sort of
19:55
benefits it is having on the forests.
19:58
And so, I thought, “Well, we’ve got to look for ways to actually
20:00
show some kind of benefit of this procedure versus another one.”
20:06
When did you read Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring?
20:08
Right about that time.
20:12
Because in ’62, it came out early, but you were not of that age yet.
20:16
Nope, but when I was at Berkeley and we were talking about all these
20:21
things, that book was front and center.
20:23
When we talked about when I was with Dahlsten talking about insecticides;
20:27
that was one of the books that was sort of like required reading.
20:30
So, yeah, that had a big effect, too.
20:35
Because that was right when they were talking about banning DDT as well,
20:38
and Robert Risebrough was doing his studies showing egg-thinning in eagle
20:44
and falcon eggs [effects from DDT]
20:46
. When they started realizing how it was traveling through the food chain
20:50
and causing all these problems.
20:51
Yeah, accumulating.
20:52
So, we had guest lecturers that would come.
20:54
There was this guy, I can’t remember his name now.
20:57
He was a professor at Davis [Univ-Cal] and big DDT advocate, and he said,
21:02
“There’s nothing wrong with DDT.” And he would stand up in front
21:04
of the lecture hall and eat DDT.
21:06
[Laughs] And say how great it was.
21:10
No, he was a crazy guy.
21:12
So, obviously, you could see where that was, as you were coming of age in
21:17
terms of having a conservation ethic.
21:20
Yeah.
21:21
Now, you finished your doctorate, and it was in, remind me again?
21:26
It was in “Wild Land Resource Sciences,” which was actually wildlife biology.
21:29
Okay, and what
21:32
was your dissertation?
21:32
Well, it was on the use of standing dead trees by counting nesting
21:34
birds in the Sierra Nevada.
21:36
It was on snags and birds.
21:38
So you really connected before you even knew who these people were or
21:42
you were colleagues of them, Jerry Franklin, Mark Harmon and all these
21:47
people, who are incorporating the whole idea of dead, decaying snags as an
21:52
essential part of the forest ecosystem?
21:53
Yes, it just fit right into where my studies have been.
21:56
When Jerry’s talking about, he used to call “messy forestry,” where
21:59
you’re leaving all these remnants of the old forest, dead trees, downed
22:03
logs, and all this stuff, it was just the right kind of stuff that
22:06
I had been studying, and I totally understand what he’s talking about.
22:11
So, you get out in what, 1980?
22:13
Uh-huh.
22:14
Ph.D. Okay, what are you going to do?
22:16
What’s your track, and did you go right to the Forest Service, or
22:20
did you go to academia for a while?
22:22
I actually stayed on and did a post-doctorate for a while.
22:26
It was doing this counting nesting bird study, and part of that had
22:31
been funded by the Forest Service, so the regional office in the Forest
22:35
Service, Region 5, and the guys there had gotten to know me, and there was
22:41
this burgeoning interest in old-growth forests, due to Jerry’s work, primarily.
22:51
One of the values was about old forests vs.
22:54
younger forests, and so Region 5 was interested in funding a study
23:00
to look at wildlife populations in different age classes.
23:05
And Region 5 was California?
23:06
It’s the California region headquartered in San Francisco.
23:09
Right, correct.
23:09
But it covers all of California.
23:10
Right.
23:13
So, they gave the university some funding to do the study and
23:17
I was the post-doc who led it.
23:20
So, we went and moved up to northern California in the Willow Creek area
23:24
and I designed and carried out a four-year study of wildlife populations
23:29
in age classes of Douglas-fir forests.
23:32
So, we looked at everything from middle-aged to really old forests, and
23:37
we studied everything in those forests.
23:39
We sampled birds, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, larger mammals.
23:44
We did the whole gamut.
23:45
So, when did you get your first exposure to the murrelet?
23:48
That wasn’t until a lot later.
23:51
But that is in their range, though?
23:53
It is.
23:53
I mean, on the coastal side of things, right?
23:54
I knew nothing about murrelets then.
23:56
Interesting.
23:57
I’d never—
23:58
Never even heard of the bird?
23:59
No, and they were flying over me at the time, and it was a bird I was unaware of.
24:05
And they might have even bombed you a couple times.
24:07
Could have.
24:08
Totally could have.
24:10
So, that study lasted until 1984, and the last year, I ended up working
24:21
in the lab of another Forest Service scientist named C.J. Ralph, and he
24:25
was at this lab called the Redwood Sciences Lab in Arcata, California.
24:30
So, when the field work ended on my old-growth study, I went to Arcata and he
24:34
provided lab space for me there, and gave me a spot to do the analysis of the data
24:40
and to start writing up reports from it.
24:42
So, I got to know the Forest Service research environment through him.
24:48
There was another guy named Jerry Verner, who was down in Fresno, another really
24:53
top-notch scientist who was involved with spotted owls and also other forest birds.
25:00
Those two guys kind of mentored me in this Forest Service research culture,
25:04
and I started getting interested in that kind of profession or place to work.
25:10
A real quick segue.
25:12
How would you compare old-growth redwood with old-growth Douglas-fir?
25:17
Well, they’re really different.
25:19
Old-growth Douglas-fir is covered with epiphytes, it’s really kind
25:24
of diverse and there’s lots of different understory plants, and
25:30
stature is sort of similar to redwoods, of course, a little bit bigger.
25:33
But redwoods are real simple in comparison.
25:36
I mean, they tend to be just redwoods and not much else, actually.
25:41
Is that bio-geochemical or canopy dynamics or
25:44
-- ? I don’t know.
25:46
Part of it has to do with just the microclimate they’re exposed to.
25:54
Some of the redwoods are in a little bit dryer forest.
25:56
It’s warmer and dryer down in California than it is up here.
25:59
Right.
26:00
And they have a more of a Mediterranean influence, whereas the maritime
26:03
influence up here with all the fog and the moisture that flows in.
26:08
So, part of it has to do with that, I think.
26:10
Okay.
26:11
So, how did you get involved in the Forest Service?
26:13
Obviously, you’ve been exposed, you’re interested in this kind of work.
26:16
Yep.
26:17
How did the transition happen?
26:18
I’d gotten to know these Forest Service researchers and I realized,
26:22
there’s a place where you can work, the research branch of the Forest Service.
26:25
I knew I really wasn’t interested in becoming a professor and teaching.
26:29
I wasn’t that thrilled with giving lectures all the time,
26:33
but I loved doing research.
26:35
So, I realized that I could do that kind of a career, and I started watching
26:41
for jobs in Forest Service research.
26:43
And sure enough, a few came open, so I started applying to those.
26:47
And it turned out that one of my fellow grad students at Berkeley, a guy named
26:51
Hal Salwasser, was with the Forest Service at the time, and he was back in Colorado.
27:00
What was he doing?
27:02
He was
27:05
the National Wildlife Ecologist for the Forest Service, but he was
27:09
located in Ft. Collins, Colorado.
27:12
He knew about this job opening at the Rocky Mountain Station
27:16
out of Laramie, and he made a big push to get me into that job.
27:21
So, I applied for it, and he was a big supporter.
27:24
Of course, he ended up becoming a big figure at Oregon State
27:27
University [Dean of OSU College of Forestry] , too, where I work now.
27:30
He was a name and he was involved with that whole huge controversy
27:33
with the Donato study [Dan Donato, Ph.D. student in College of Forestry]
27:36
of salvage logging and that stuff.
27:37
But
27:40
yeah, he was quite the character.
27:41
We used to call him “Senator Sal.”
27:44
Really?
27:44
He was always the political type, just a real glad-hander and back-slapper,
27:50
the opposite of a lot of the rest of us, but he was a character.
27:54
He was huge in my development.
27:55
How so?
27:56
Because he really helped me get into that job.
27:59
He was a huge proponent, and he would have been in San Francisco when
28:02
I had done this old-growth study.
28:05
So, he was the one that actually provided the funding that I was working under.
28:08
He knew me really well, so when he went to Colorado and saw this opening,
28:12
he said, “Ah, Marty would be perfect for it.” Because they wanted to expand
28:16
their work from just deer and elk to looking at non-game species as well, and
28:20
taking a broader look at wildlife, as opposed to just the hook and bullet type
28:26
[fishing/hunting] . He thought I would be perfect for that and it was my interest.
28:31
Which is just really another way of saying one of the many aspects that
28:35
we see across our society, science, management, otherwise, activism, where
28:40
the humanistic focus was being challenged, if not overturned, by a more holistic,
28:47
ecological ethic and perspective?
28:49
There you go.
28:50
That’s well-stated.
28:52
And so, now you were
28:56
out of Laramie.
28:57
Is the station up in the Big Snowies?
28:58
[“Snowy Range” is highest part of Medicine Bow mtns.]
29:02
It’s the Rocky Mountain Research Station, Laramie Sciences Laboratory,
29:02
on the edge of the Medicine Bow Mountains, which is the University
29:02
of Wyoming’s research station.
29:02
The Medicine Bow, excuse me, right.
29:05
What is the elevation there, about 9,000 feet or so?
29:07
[Research station, not Laramie]
29:07
No, it’s about 7,200 feet or something.
29:11
So, what work did you do there, and how did that figure into how things
29:15
started to evolve as your science career in the Forest Service proceeded?
29:19
Well, a few things.
29:20
I had that exposure to nest boxes through Don Dahlsten’s work.
29:25
So, I did a nest box study and put up several hundred nest boxes in this forest.
29:32
Well, it turned out, there was this opportunity to
29:34
study contrasting watersheds.
29:37
This is in the Medicine Bow Mountains.
29:39
One watershed was being harvested with these little, tiny patch cuts, because
29:43
they thought snow would accumulate in these openings and the surrounding trees
29:49
would protect them from being blown away by the wind, which is a huge factor there
29:52
where the wind just scours these hills.
29:54
But if you do small openings in the forest, the snow can accumulate,
29:59
and therefore be available for subsequent runoff in the spring, so
30:04
it would be a way of managing water.
30:06
So, they wanted to do an experiment where one watershed was cut over with these
30:10
little, tiny patch cuts and the other one would be left alone as a control.
30:14
Your typical paired-watershed type study.
30:17
Yeah.
30:17
I mean, with whatever the subject and your goal happened to be, right.
30:20
Correct, so this was a perfect chance to see what the wildlife implications of that
30:24
kind of management would be, so we did a whole bunch of different things there.
30:27
One was this nest box study with chickadees.
30:30
Another one was an American marten study, which is a forest carnivore, and
30:34
we started catching martens and putting radio telemetry [sensors] on them and
30:38
looking at their movement patterns in the cutover area versus the un-cutover area.
30:44
Then,
30:46
we just did a bunch of bird transects and small animal transects where we
30:52
put out sample plots and counted.
30:56
We did a real thorough study.
30:58
I was there for five years and this was all pre-treatment there.
31:01
The treatments weren’t going to happen until, let’s see,
31:06
1990, and I was there from—
31:08
Meaning, the logging [treatment] , right?
31:10
When I was there, it was all pre-logging, so I was doing this
31:13
comparison before anything happened.
31:15
And what was the forest type there, the dominant type?
31:18
It was subalpine fir and lodgepole pine.
31:22
Okay, but these weren’t really, were these merchantable timber?
31:27
Yeah.
31:28
Okay, they were big enough for that, okay.
31:31
Would this have been considered an “old-growthy” kind of
31:35
forest of that ecology?
31:37
Of that ecology.
31:38
Yeah, I mean, I’m not comparing it to the big—
31:40
Nothing like old-growth here.
31:42
I mean, and I don’t even want to use the word climax, because that’s
31:45
out of favor and too simplistic, but more or less, a facsimile
31:50
for an old-growth kind of forest?
31:51
It was mature forest.
31:52
Mature forest or late-successional, would be a better way of calling it.
31:57
Yeah, and it was quite variable.
31:59
I mean, on the drier areas, it was lodgepole pine, on the moister areas it
32:03
was engelman spruce and sub-alpine fir.
32:06
Really kind of interesting, really nice, beautiful area.
32:11
But I put in all these different plots and hired big crews, and
32:15
we sampled that stuff every year.
32:19
Then, there was the opportunity to come back here.
32:22
But what was the big lesson out of that?
32:24
I mean, if you were going to take away something, what was the big
32:27
thing you learned or that took you forward and you learned from that?
32:34
Because none of the treatments happened,
32:38
what I really learned was the research techniques, just sort of honing my
32:46
methodological skills, and being able to apply sampling methods to problems.
32:52
I mean, I saw a big variation in the wildlife response to
32:57
these different forest types within this general ecosystem.
33:02
But nothing huge emerged because the real lessons didn’t happen until
33:07
later when the treatments went in.
33:12
Did they do comparative type treatments, like a clear-cut, strip cuts, etc.?
33:17
No, this one was just, it was strictly these small patch-cuts.
33:20
Just patch-cuts, okay.
33:21
Designed to create augmented water.
33:25
Hey, you know what, I need to take a quick restroom break.
33:28
[Break]
33:29
We just took a short break.
33:30
We’re going to
33:32
continue, and Marty’s going to move from where he was talking about
33:37
his work at Laramie, and where that led to the next step in his career.
33:43
While I was at Laramie,
33:47
simultaneously, there had been a study that had been started to look
33:51
at the same type of thing I was doing for this post-doctoral study.
33:55
This was a large effort with multiple scientists studying wildlife in different
34:01
seral-age classes of Douglas-fir forests.
34:04
It was called the Wildlife Habitat Relationships Program, and Len
34:08
Ruggiero was a scientist here, actually located at the Olympia
34:12
Lab, who was leading this effort.
34:15
It was a program within the Pacific Northwest Research Station, and
34:20
the station director at the time was a guy named Charlie Philpot.
34:25
Len had always wanted to go to the Rocky Mountains.
34:29
That’s where he really wanted to be.
34:31
He wasn’t that happy here in the Northwest.
34:34
I was in the Rocky Mountains, and my wife and I were really interested
34:37
in the West Coast, because we grew up sailing, we met sailing, and we
34:41
loved to be out on the water and being close to the marine environment.
34:45
It was something we wanted to do.
34:48
We had grown up on the West Coast and this is where we figured our home really was.
34:53
So this opportunity presented itself for the two of us to literally switch jobs.
35:00
Len would take over what I was doing, and I would take over what he
35:03
was doing, and we would just trade places because we were at equivalent
35:06
levels within the research branch.
35:08
So, in 1989, that’s what we did.
35:11
We literally switched.
35:13
And this guy, Philpot, who was the director, was totally in favor of it
35:17
because he wanted to keep doing the type of work that had been going on here.
35:22
The wildlife program was just winding down, but they were going
35:25
to follow-up with additional work on the spotted owl and other
35:28
species associated with old forest.
35:30
And so, they wanted a scientist to keep pursuing that work.
35:34
So, you arrived in 1989 at the height of the “forest wars”?
35:39
Yes.
35:40
And it was a year before the Seattle Audubon Society, actually
35:43
the year that they filed the suit that led to the Dwyer injunction.
35:49
So, tell me about you arriving into this milieu as a scientist, but also
35:56
the political situation that you would soon find yourself involved in.
36:03
So, this controversy over management of old-growth forests was reaching its peak.
36:10
But I felt well-positioned to sort of participate in this discussion,
36:14
because I had this history of having worked in old forests and
36:17
comparing wildlife and old to younger forests back in those post-doc days.
36:22
I was looking at wildlife, a broad suite of different wildlife species in Laramie,
36:28
and was totally immersed with just looking at the big picture and seeing
36:33
how forest management affected wildlife.
36:35
So, it looked like a perfect chance to sort of continue pursuing the
36:41
line of work that I had started in.
36:43
And it was just really thrilling, you might say, to be involved with
36:47
something that was gaining such high notoriety and public attention.
36:51
To be in the midst of something that was really perceived to be
36:56
important, was kind of awe-inspiring and a little scary in ways, like, you
37:01
know, I didn’t want to screw it up.
37:02
But it was exciting.
37:06
How would you compare the politics of the Rocky Mountains to here
37:11
in terms of forest management?
37:14
Obviously, less merchantable big timber there perhaps, but still,
37:19
just a much different environment.
37:21
It was.
37:22
And so, I went over there to study so-called non-game wildlife.
37:26
But the environment was all about game wildlife.
37:30
Deer and elk were what people were interested in there.
37:34
So,
37:36
I felt a little bit out of place.
37:38
I didn’t find a real strong support for the work I was doing, even though
37:42
the managers realized it was important in terms of public perception.
37:48
Because you weren’t focused on megafauna, right?
37:50
Correct.
37:51
Okay.
37:52
Correct.
37:54
In terms of the politics of forest management, like you were saying,
37:58
it wasn’t as big a deal there.
37:59
There wasn’t as much money in forests, in logging and timber
38:04
values, not as much as here.
38:06
Actually, the management of the forests for some of these other species,
38:09
like deer and elk, is a bigger deal.
38:14
Still,
38:16
there was a big emphasis on timber there.
38:20
Logging was a big deal, just nothing compared to the way it is out here.
38:25
So out here, this long history of clear-cutting and the mega-money that
38:31
was involved in these communities totally dependent on logging, that’s
38:35
really different than the way it was in Laramie where there wasn’t quite
38:39
such a tight connection between the fate, the economic fate of these local
38:43
communities and logging operations.
38:45
You were also on the interface between ranching country and the mountains,
38:50
and it was a much different dynamic.
38:52
Exactly.
38:53
Yeah, grazing was a much bigger deal over there than out here.
38:59
And I guess, too, if you were talking about environmental degradation
39:02
issues in the Rockies, especially down further south in Colorado,
39:05
it would be more with mining and
39:09
hydrological impacts of unregulated activities, or even old tailings
39:13
that hadn’t been treated or packed, you know, the long-term
39:17
effects on watersheds and the like?
39:18
Right, and energy development was another big thing.
39:22
So, oil and to some extent coal, but not so much, but especially oil development,
39:26
was big back there, or becoming big.
39:29
There was a lot of concern about that.
39:32
So, you came to this lab we’re at right now.
39:34
Yep.
39:34
This was the place you came right to?
39:36
Raphael: This is where I moved to, right here.
39:38
Okay, so what was your first job?
39:41
What were you charged to do?
39:43
Your position and what was your first task, shall we say?
39:50
Because the old-growth study had wound down,
39:59
the first thing was to oversee these developing demographic study
40:05
areas for the northern spotted owl.
40:06
Eric Forsman [leading owl biologist] was here at this lab at that time, too.
40:10
So, he was leading the owl work and I needed to help him establish
40:14
new study areas and get those up and running, because there was
40:18
a big interest in looking at the detailed demography of spotted owls.
40:22
But this was before the injunction?
40:27
Yeah, this was right
40:30
before it.
40:32
But those studies, the first of those had started in 1985, so
40:35
they had a bit of a history going.
40:38
There was continuing that, and there was the interest in forest carnivores.
40:43
I had gotten this experience working with martens back there
40:46
[Rockies] . And so, we started a similar study here looking at martens.
41:01
Pretty much the day I arrived, I started getting involved with the management
41:06
side of things, and starting to get involved with environmental impact
41:11
statements that were being developed around forest management alternatives.
41:15
So, like within two years after I arrived, I jumped in and started working with the
41:20
national forest managers on those things.
41:23
What was your understanding of the Endangered Species Act, the definition of
41:29
an indicator species, the politics of it?
41:32
I mean, what did you understand when you came here, and how quickly did you come
41:37
to understand things on a deeper level?
41:41
Well, I knew that it was tremendously important.
41:42
We had the National Forest Management Act , and I was operating under a sense
41:50
about the viability requirements under the National Forest Management Act.
41:53
So, that was
41:57
sort of upper-most in my mind.
41:59
Totally aware of the Endangered Species Act, because we were already contending
42:04
with listed species here and there.
42:07
I wasn’t studying them per se when I was in Laramie, but I knew about them because
42:12
there were other species like the Wyoming toad and others, that were having a big
42:16
impact on ranching operations there.
42:19
And of course, when I got here, it’s a whole different thing.
42:22
And of course, the snail darter and the Tellico Dam, and the whooping
42:27
crane in Nebraska, these were all precedent-setting in the ‘70s in
42:33
terms of the ESA listings, and how it would actually become politicized.
42:37
Right, and do you remember the P eripheral Canal?
42:40
It was this whole thing in California about what was called a peripheral
42:44
canal, which was a major issue, as water resources were a big thing
42:50
there, and still are, of course.
42:51
Is this somewhere down in the San Joaquin Valley?
42:54
Yeah, this is the San Joaquin, the Sacramento River Delta.
42:57
Right.
42:57
They needed to get water from north to south, as L.A. was running out of water.
43:01
They needed more water, and one way to do that was build a big canal.
43:05
A cross-basin transfer.
43:06
Yes, around the periphery of the San Joaquin Delta, and to
43:11
take water from north to south.
43:13
But there were these huge issues about the impacts that this would
43:17
have on all these native fishes.
43:19
When I was at school at Berkeley, I convened a whole lecture series on
43:27
the Peripheral Canal, and had speakers come in from the water resource and
43:32
fisheries communities, and other places, to talk about the ramifications of
43:37
a peripheral canal, the good things about it, and the bad things about it.
43:42
So, these kinds of environmental controversies are part of my background,
43:49
for sure, starting with the insecticide controversies that I mentioned earlier.
43:54
So, you had a lot of knowledge of all the issues surrounding
43:58
the political hot-button issues?
44:00
Well, I knew about how these things kind of work.
44:05
I didn’t have totally in-depth knowledge of every one of them,
44:09
obviously, but I was certainly used to them in a contentious environment,
44:13
and trying to apply science to help inform decisions that were being made.
44:18
That was my big interest.
44:20
Tell me about meeting Eric and learning about the spotted owl, which is
44:26
obviously the big symbolic species, but just what you learned from him
44:30
and how he portrayed that dynamic?
44:34
When I was working in northern California on this post-doc, they
44:40
were just starting a spotted owl research project in the same vicinity,
44:45
at the Willow Creek Study Area.
44:47
I lived in Willow Creek.
44:50
Alan Franklin, another researcher working with a guy named Rocky Gutierrez,
44:55
a faculty member at Humboldt State University, who had this spotted
45:01
owl project that was just starting.
45:04
I realized, they’re going to do the spotted owl work, and
45:06
I’ll study everything else.
45:08
But I kept interacting with those guys, so I became aware of spotted owls and
45:12
went out with their crews when they were surveying for owls at night.
45:15
And the whole time I was doing that, I kept hearing about this guy, Eric
45:18
Forsman, who had developed the original techniques for studying spotted owls,
45:24
and he was the first one to really start understanding the relationship
45:27
between spotted owls and old forests.
45:30
He was kind of this [icon] , just like Jerry Franklin, who
45:33
I always wanted to meet.
45:35
I always wanted to meet Eric Forsman, and I hadn’t actually
45:39
met him until I came back.
45:40
I was never at a meeting with him the whole time I was at Laramie, or
45:44
after I left northern California, because I kept working on data from
45:50
the California days, as I was still involved with old-growth forest data.
45:56
But I had just encountered him, and then, it turned out, here I was working
46:01
with him directly, when I came back to the lab [Olympia] . It was really great.
46:04
And what he was doing were these detailed demographic studies.
46:10
I’d done work where I was basically counting things, doing inventories
46:16
and estimating population sizes.
46:18
But I’d never done any demographic work where you’re estimating vital
46:22
rates of species, like what’s their annual survival rate, what’s the
46:27
rate of the fecundity, and the number of young that are being born.
46:30
The more sophisticated matrix-type studies of different factors, right?
46:35
Exactly, exactly.
46:35
So, he exposed me to that.
46:38
But also, at the same time, there was a guy, Barry Noon, who was at Humboldt
46:42
State at the time I was around.
46:43
He was a population biologist, and he helped introduce me to those concepts.
46:48
When I came back, he was a scientist with the Pacific Southwest Research
46:54
Station working out of the same lab that C.J. Ralph was in.
47:01
Shortly after I arrived, I think I mentioned that I got involved with
47:05
the Forest Service’s environmental impact statement, and we were
47:09
trying to understand what all this population data meant.
47:12
I was relying on Eric and Barry.
47:16
They educated me on how to interpret what these vital rates for owls were about,
47:21
and how do you use those rates somehow.
47:23
So, that was a huge, expansive,
47:28
intellectual eye-opener for me.
47:30
Now, a lot of the studies that had been going on, Eric started his work during
47:33
his master’s program in the ‘70s down in the Andrews Forest, and around Oregon.
47:39
This work developed, and of course, the “Forest Wars” started, and as they
47:44
played out in the ‘80s, there were all kinds of efforts by the Fish and Wildlife
47:48
Service, by the Forest Service, to decide how and when and where to list them.
47:52
Correct?
47:53
Uh-huh.
47:53
And there were a lot of debates over that.
47:55
And I believe the [U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service was rather late
47:58
in coming to that determination, and the Forest Service came first.
48:00
Was that correct?
48:03
I don’t know for sure about that.
48:05
I just remember all the different ways and attempts to try to manage
48:09
for spotted owls, and this whole evolution of protected areas.
48:14
What’s your understanding of how they were trying to do it in the ‘80s, before
48:19
the injunction, when they were trying to come to grips with doing individual
48:24
national forest plans under the 1976 National Forest Management Act, and
48:28
then, falling short of being able to meet the ESA and listing requirements,
48:34
which I believe is why none of them flew?
48:38
Intentional metaphor, I guess, for
48:42
birds.
48:42
So, what was your understanding of why those fell short of what people
48:47
thought would pass legal muster?
48:49
Well, it’s vague at this point.
48:52
But in those days, they were managing individual owl pairs, and they
48:58
hadn’t come up with a broad ecosystem approach to their management, yet.
49:03
They had what were called SOHA’s, Spotted Owl Habitat Areas, which are
49:07
individual patches of forest around known activity centers of the owls.
49:15
But environmentalists just kept challenging these management plans,
49:19
saying they are not sufficient.
49:21
These owls depend on old forests, and you’re not really protecting
49:24
old forests, you’re just protecting these individual patches around the
49:27
birds, and it’s not going to work.
49:29
So, they kept challenging these forest plans on that basis, and they
49:34
would prevail in court every time.
49:38
It became obvious over those years that a broader approach was needed.
49:43
Eventually, that led to the ISC [Interagency Scientific Committee]
49:45
report and the subsequent – [Northwest Forest Plan process, Gang of Four, etc.]
49:48
Were you involved with the ISC report?
49:50
No, I wasn’t.
49:51
Just tangentially, just helping facilitate some of the work.
49:54
That was the one led by Jack Ward Thomas, correct?
49:57
It was led by Thomas.
49:58
That’s when he first really dove into this whole thing.
50:01
Now, he was over in eastern Oregon at that time?
50:03
He was in eastern Oregon.
50:05
He had done some early pioneering work, it was called a WHR program,
50:10
Wildlife Habitat Relationships.
50:12
And for the first time, we are looking at habitat requirements of
50:15
all the species, all the vertebrates that occurred on these forests, and
50:18
developing a system for the managers to
50:22
tally what habitats were being used by each of these species, and which
50:25
ones they might have on their lands.
50:29
But his [Thomas] main field of expertise was in deer and elk, primarily elk.
50:33
He had the Starkey Experimental Forest, and they were doing this really neat
50:36
study of activity patterns, movements of elk within this fenced-in area.
50:44
He was a big-game biologist primarily, but he had done this really fantastic stuff to
50:49
bring in information on everything else.
50:54
He was just really effective,
50:59
a hustler, and could get things done.
51:02
It was just amazing to see him in action.
51:06
All these walls would just crumble in front of Jack Thomas.
51:09
He had a strong personality?
51:10
He did, and he could relate to people.
51:12
He could sell himself and his expertise like nobody else.
51:17
How do you remember reading the ISC report, knowing Jack and his
51:22
work and force of his personality, and how that affected things going
51:27
forward, from the ISC report through everything [-] , from, we’re looking
51:32
at the FEMAT report here, the Record of Decision, and everything else.
51:36
How would you describe that process, not just regarding the owl and the
51:41
murrelet, and we’re going to get to that [murrelet] in a minute, in terms of just
51:45
the idea of endangered species, but also biodiversity, the health of the forest?
51:50
Do you want to give a little sketch of that?
51:51
Well, it was earth-shattering.
51:54
It was just the boldest proposal that had ever come out for managing
51:59
forests for anything other than timber.
52:04
Because this was the first time when big areas of land were proposed to
52:08
be set aside for a conservational objective, as the number one objective.
52:13
It started out, like I was saying, with these little patches of forest around each
52:18
individual owl, and suddenly, here’s this plan to make these big land areas that
52:25
would support clusters of owls, and at the same time, provide benefits to everything
52:31
else dependent upon those old forests.
52:34
Unfortunately, with the ISC report, there was no real assessment of
52:39
how other species would really fare, so that sort of came later.
52:44
But it was a major paradigm shift.
52:45
It was a whole, new way of thinking.
52:47
Managers freaked out.
52:48
They said, “How can we set aside this much forest, it will ruin us.” Conservationists
52:53
said, “This is the best thing ever.
52:55
We need to go in this direction.”
52:57
And the timber interests freaked out even more?
53:00
Oh, yeah, totally.
53:02
Because you can just see, the timber volume would plummet as a result.
53:08
What they had tried to do was, we’re going to have these big conservation areas, but
53:13
everything in between, it subsequently became known as the “Matrix.” [Zoning
53:18
category–Northwest Forest Plan] The Matrix would be available for timber harvest.
53:23
Environmentalists didn’t like that.
53:24
They didn’t want to see any old growth harvested, but the “owl
53:28
mafia,” as it was called then, said
53:33
we can afford to let some habitat go in the short-term to provide economic
53:37
benefits, because of the long-term benefit afforded by creating these
53:41
large reserves, which we are modeling.
53:44
What the modeling shows should be sufficient to allow for a long-term
53:50
persistence in owls, if we have these large patches with multiple
53:54
pairs of owls that can interact and recolonize and reproduce.
53:59
It
54:01
was a huge, huge change in the direction of forest research.
54:07
But there was a need, if they were going to implement this, to do an
54:11
environmental impact statement, and that’s where problems arose.
54:15
I was working with, not with ISC, but I was working with the EIS group.
54:20
And so, I helped them.
54:23
Is this what eventually became the EIS report for the spotted owl,
54:31
which came out in ’92 or ’93?
54:32
I think it was ’92.
54:32
It was before the Clinton Summit in Portland?
54:35
By the way, just for the record, the Clinton Summit happened in April of ’93?
54:38
Uh-huh.
54:39
April or
54:42
March, but anyway.
54:45
I worked with the national forest people.
54:49
They were Kathy O’Halleron, who was then forest ecologist on the
54:53
Olympic [National Forest] , Kim Mellon, now Kim Mellon-McClane,
54:58
biologist with Mt. Hood [NF] , but she was also sort of a regional ecologist.
55:03
There was a whole team of us that sat down to do an evaluation of the implications
55:10
of the ISC report on all the resources that have been, what’s the word?
55:18
It’s not status and trends.
55:21
I can’t remember the terminology they used.
55:23
But anyway, it’s the effect to the environment.
55:28
At the same time, partly a result of the Gang of Four report in which
55:32
they did a viability assessment on other species associated with various
55:37
alternatives [management] , and in that viability assessment, it was
55:42
determined that a lot of those species would not have a high likelihood of
55:46
persisting in the future, because
55:51
this plan, although maybe good for the spotted owl, wasn’t necessarily
55:55
good for those other species.
55:57
That final EIS came out, it was challenged by the environmental litigants, and they
56:05
pointed out that these other species had a low-to-medium probability of persistence
56:10
under the National Forest Management Act.
56:12
We needed to provide for viability of all species associated with the forests.
56:17
And then, after FEMAT—well, or maybe after Record of Decision, because it
56:28
[survey and manage] was in there, the “survey and manage” provision was added
56:32
to answer concerns about all the species.
56:36
Correct?
56:37
Not just the “charismatic megafauna” or whatever you want to call the owl and the
56:41
murrelet and the more “sexy” creatures.
56:41
Correct.
56:41
Yeah, you’re right, so
56:44
there was a whole process that led to that, and I was deeply
56:47
involved with that whole process.
56:51
But anyway, there was a challenge by the environmentalists, and that’s
56:56
what led to the Dwyer injunction.
56:58
So, they saw that the viability requirements for these other species
57:01
was low-to-medium and needed to be high, and they prevailed in court.
57:06
So, the plan, although great for spotted owls, wasn’t going to be
57:10
great for these other species, and so you needed to do something.
57:13
And this also included aquatic species, correct?
57:15
Yeah.
57:16
Salmon and other things, not just commercial, but all species.
57:21
Right.
57:25
So, that’s what then led to the big injunction that kind of brought to a
57:30
grinding halt, all forest management.
57:33
That’s what led Clinton to step in.
57:36
He made a few phone calls and talked with Jack Thomas.
57:40
They came up with a charter, a plan to come up with a broader assessment that
57:46
would fully address these other species at the same time, with the charge that
57:51
now, the idea is we want to provide for viability of everything associated with
57:57
old forests, not just spotted owls.
58:00
So, the charter is in the first few pages of this document.
58:06
He’s pointing to the FEMAT report.
58:08
Yep.
58:10
I don’t
58:13
know what pages it’s on, but there is a charter for the FEMAT group.
58:19
You mean, what basically Clinton charged them to do?
58:22
That’s
58:26
pretty much in the preface to the FEMAT report.
58:30
That set the stage for doing management on a broad scale, addressing
58:36
viability requirements for all species associated with old forests.
58:41
More importantly, it was sort of like that was the primary directive,
58:45
and then, while doing that, be mindful of the need to provide for
58:53
economics and social well-being and the needs of timber-dependent communities.
59:00
But it was like you had to do the ecological requirements first,
59:04
and then, to the extent possible, meet the requirements for these
59:08
other important dimensions.
59:12
So?
59:13
So, we talked about, we convened this group called “Ecological, Economic
59:17
and Social Assessment,” in which we needed to assess not only ecology,
59:21
but also economic assessments.
59:21
You’re talking about how you planned the FEMAT report?
59:24
Uh-huh.
59:25
Now, were you at the Clinton Summit?
59:29
I was nearby.
59:30
I wasn’t in it.
59:31
But did you watch it on television?
59:33
Yeah.
59:34
We were there already because we had the charter, and were underway.
59:38
All of us were in the meeting room [PNW Station] while the summit was going on.
59:42
We were all in Portland and watched it.
59:46
Did you realize the gravity of this, when a sitting president made it one of his
59:50
first missions to fly out to a region?
59:53
Yeah.
59:54
And actually, it was a campaign promise of his during the campaign.
59:57
And he said, “I’m going to follow up,” and he did.
59:59
And what do you remember about your impressions, something
1:00:01
like, wow, this is happening?
1:00:03
Yeah, it was awesome because, I just couldn’t believe it, here
1:00:06
is the President of the United States asking us to do this work.
1:00:10
He’s coming out here to talk about doing this work, and meeting with a
1:00:13
group of scientists to set it in motion.
1:00:16
Once we started, we were constantly having visits with Secretary [Interior]
1:00:20
Babbitt or staff from the White House, who were constantly meeting with us
1:00:26
and seeing how things were going.
1:00:27
Was it Espy, Mike Espy, who was with Agriculture?
1:00:32
[Secretary]
1:00:33
Was he the guy then?
1:00:34
I’m not sure who [Sec.
1:00:35
of Ag.] was then.
1:00:36
There were a couple shifts there during the early part of the Clinton years.
1:00:41
I know we met with Espy.
1:00:43
But I remember we met with him when there was an SAT report that
1:00:49
we had done before this happened.
1:00:50
Espy
1:00:55
was the guy we briefed.
1:00:56
I think he was still Agriculture Secretary, but I’m not positive though.
1:01:01
So, you were involved with the FEMAT?
1:01:04
Uh-huh, oh, yeah.
1:01:05
[Raphael was a deputy leader on FEMAT]
1:01:06
Tell me about that.
1:01:08
First you were charged, you were given sixty days, and then they said, we’ll give
1:01:11
you ninety days, still kind of ridiculous.
1:01:14
[Thirty days added to create alternative acceptable to White House.]
1:01:15
Kind of ridiculous.
1:01:15
Kind of a short time.
1:01:16
But tell me about your role in that, your perceptions, but also share some
1:01:22
memories of the whole process, the “pink tower” [U.S. Bank Building]
1:01:24
in Portland, and that whole thing.
1:01:28
Right.
1:01:28
I was the deputy leader.
1:01:32
Jack was the overall leader of the group.
1:01:34
I was the deputy leader, and my job, I was sort of like the ramrod that was
1:01:38
helping make sure all the little parts came into play, so that we convened
1:01:43
the meetings we needed to convene, that we got the experts we needed to get.
1:01:48
I just helped shape the actual day-to-day operations, whereas he was
1:01:51
sort of the intellectual-spiritual guidance of the whole effort.
1:01:56
I was like
1:01:59
the “little-doer” guy.
1:02:00
You were the gopher.
1:02:01
Yeah, I was the gopher.
1:02:04
Right.
1:02:04
And so?
1:02:05
And we all were brought into that “pink tower.” We actually moved there.
1:02:11
For the record, the pink tower is the U.S. Bank Building in downtown
1:02:15
Portland, people affectionately call the “pink tower.” [pinkish hue color]
1:02:20
We rented a whole floor, it was the 14th floor of the pink tower.
1:02:24
We had the whole thing to ourselves, and it was guarded so nobody
1:02:28
else could come in there without
1:02:33
the right credentials to get in.
1:02:35
And all these people, I mean, there were like 60-100 of us
1:02:39
working in there at any one time.
1:02:40
And people like Jerry, you know, a big professor at the UW [Univ-Wash.]
1:02:46
at the time, and he was down there almost on a daily basis.
1:02:48
He wasn’t there as much as some of the others, but a lot
1:02:50
of us were there full-time.
1:02:52
Some of you guys were sleeping under desks.
1:02:55
Some of them were.
1:02:57
They rented apartments for everybody nearby.
1:03:00
I was living in a little apartment building just a few blocks away.
1:03:07
Nowadays, you’d never get permission to pay for the per diem and
1:03:11
everything else it would take for these people to come together.
1:03:13
You’d never get them to be able to break away from their current jobs and
1:03:17
focus 100% of the attention on this.
1:03:19
I always view this like I was doing my Ph.D., as it was one of the
1:03:23
few times in my life when I could totally focus on a task, because we
1:03:28
were basically given the right and authority to just drop everything else.
1:03:34
We focused on that completely because of the timeframe we were under.
1:03:38
You couldn’t just do this as another duty as an aside.
1:03:42
What was the reaction of you, Jack, other leaders, or anybody, when
1:03:47
you heard sixty or ninety days?
1:03:49
Do you remember some of
1:03:52
the “really” reactions?
1:03:54
Right, like how can this possibly happen?
1:03:55
But realizing, okay, we’ve got to do something, how did you
1:04:01
[You, Jack, others] plan to make that possible?
1:04:05
We started with kind of a rough outline about, “here are the things
1:04:09
we needed to do.” At some of these first meetings, we could be in these
1:04:12
all-hands meetings right off the bat, and there was kind of a core group there.
1:04:17
We had all these different teams.
1:04:18
We had a terrestrial team, an aquatics team, a silviculture team,
1:04:22
and economics team, a social team.
1:04:25
We’d get the team leads and deputies from each of those to get together,
1:04:28
and we’d say, “Okay, if we’re going to do this, what are the pieces
1:04:33
we need to have?” “Well, for the terrestrials, we need to convene
1:04:39
some sort of way to assess viability for all these species.” “Well, which
1:04:42
species?” “We have to figure out what all the species are, so we have to
1:04:47
come up with a list.” What are all the species associated with old forests?
1:04:50
So, there were all these tasks we started lining up there that had to be done,
1:04:54
and each one of them was really big.
1:04:57
But we just focused and worked there, you know, it was 16-hour days typically; get
1:05:06
up there at breakfast time, stay till dinner, go out to dinner, come
1:05:10
back and work there after dinner.
1:05:12
Were the pizza delivery guys nearby real busy?
1:05:15
No, we didn’t really have that.
1:05:16
No, none of that?
1:05:18
Okay.
1:05:18
There’s a million restaurants around that building and we’d just range out,
1:05:21
get something, and then come back.
1:05:23
They must have got to know you though, all the staff [at restaurants]
1:05:26
? They did.
1:05:28
Oh, you’re one of those guys.
1:05:30
Yeah, so, anyway.
1:05:31
Now, what was
1:05:31
-- ? I was lining out all these tasks, and we knew this is going to be hard, but we put
1:05:37
together outlines, so like, here’s the things we need to do, and we made a flow
1:05:42
chart, like a Gantt chart or whatever it’s called now, that showed a timeline.
1:05:46
And we had to flesh out these alternatives.
1:05:50
That was number one.
1:05:51
We had to come up with a range of alternatives, and
1:05:53
what would these look like?
1:05:54
And
1:05:57
if we had those alternatives, then we had to come up with a way of
1:06:00
describing environmental conditions under each alternative, and we’d
1:06:04
have to have a way of forecasting and describing vegetation conditions
1:06:09
now, but also out into the future.
1:06:11
Because we knew that this was a 100-year plan, we had to look at how these species
1:06:17
would fare from now to 100 years into the future, so we had to have some way.
1:06:22
Projection model, if you will?
1:06:23
Exactly.
1:06:24
In those days, we didn’t have all of the sophisticated tools we have
1:06:29
now to do vegetation modeling.
1:06:30
You didn’t have the software or computers where you can do
1:06:33
these incredibly complex, serious number-crunching tasks in an instant.
1:06:39
Yeah, but it [computer revolution] was starting, so we had GIS then.
1:06:41
Okay.
1:06:42
It was kind of rudimentary, but we had GIS.
1:06:45
We had really good spreadsheet data and stuff like that, but we didn’t
1:06:50
have vegetation maps that covered the entire wall-to-wall area.
1:06:55
The first sort of Landsat vegetation imagery, we had contracted with an outfit
1:07:02
called Pacific Marine and Resources, and they did a really crude map by
1:07:07
today’s standards, but they did an old-growth map based on satellite imagery,
1:07:13
the first time that had been done.
1:07:16
There were a lot of pioneering things that were developed in this effort, and
1:07:20
it was amazing that we did do all those.
1:07:24
It’s almost kind of a loose analogy to wartime.
1:07:27
War is war, but a lot of really interesting things -- medical,
1:07:32
technological, etc. -- come out of these intense survival efforts, shall
1:07:37
we say, of conflict between societies.
1:07:39
Like
1:07:42
the viability assessments where we convened these panels of experts to
1:07:46
come in, because we didn’t have data on populations of these species or
1:07:52
how they were related to habitats and how their habitats would change,
1:07:55
we’d have to get experts to do these sorts of mental processes.
1:07:58
But it couldn’t just be a kind of, oh, let’s sit around and talk about it,
1:08:02
we had to have a structured process.
1:08:04
So we developed a really tightly-structured process for
1:08:08
eliciting the opinions of these people, scoring them into a
1:08:14
reputable sort of tool, protocol or toolkit, summarizing the
1:08:22
data and then portraying it.
1:08:25
And we came up with a really cool scheme for doing that at the time.
1:08:31
It was a struggle, though, because trying to define these
1:08:36
alternatives was no easy task.
1:08:39
First of all, what are we trying to accomplish and how do we assess these
1:08:43
different tradeoffs so we could have more of this and more of that, and
1:08:46
could sort of push more toward timber volume and less toward timber volume.
1:08:51
How do we do that?
1:08:53
Riparian buffer sizes?
1:08:54
Yeah.
1:08:56
What are those buffers?
1:08:57
We kept trying to pin people down.
1:08:59
If you’re saying we’re going to have buffers, what are they?
1:09:01
How big are they?
1:09:03
How much of the land area would these buffers cover?
1:09:08
Nobody knew.
1:09:10
And the aquatic guys would change their minds on a daily basis.
1:09:14
Well, we’re going to have buffers that are a site potential tree in size.
1:09:20
No, we’re going to have two.
1:09:21
No, we’re going to have one.
1:09:22
No, we’re going to have a half.
1:09:23
We kept struggling.
1:09:25
But we’ve got to pin it down because if we’re going to do these
1:09:27
assessments, we have to know.
1:09:29
Also, we have to have a way of describing what it is.
1:09:31
And there has to be some scientific basis, not just what sounds good?
1:09:34
Yeah.
1:09:37
The scientific basis became a figure
1:09:42
[illustration] that, you see it all the time now, but it’s a figure showing the
1:09:46
width of the buffer, and then on the y-axis, was the probability of these
1:09:51
different things; wood delivery to the stream, and various attributes a riparian
1:09:59
buffer would cover, like shading of the water to provide cooler temperatures.
1:10:04
And that led to an ultimate decision, we’re going to draw the line right
1:10:08
here and it’s going to be one site potential tree on intermittent
1:10:12
streams throughout the system.
1:10:15
Once we had that, then we could kick in a description of what the alternative
1:10:19
was, including that component.
1:10:21
Then that led to our being able to do the viability assessment,
1:10:25
and led to an assessment of how these species would fare.
1:10:30
All that stuff got summarized in here [FEMAT rept.]
1:10:33
When did you realize that sixty days wasn’t enough?
1:10:36
[Laughter]
1:10:36
Right from day one.
1:10:38
You’re already preparing your story of how to ask for thirty more days?
1:10:44
Yep.
1:10:46
I know one of the big things that happened toward the end, was the
1:10:51
White House kept coming back, because as we were getting close,
1:10:54
we had these different alternatives.
1:10:56
Is this when you had the final ten, or was this when you still had that big
1:11:00
group, wasn’t there like sixty or seventy?
1:11:02
Oh, no, there were never that many.
1:11:04
I mean, there were lots of
1:11:05
— Sixty or seventy ideas?
1:11:07
Not alternatives.
1:11:08
I’m using the wrong terms.
1:11:09
Yeah, there were lots of ideas about what each one of them would look
1:11:11
like, and they had to coalesce into a real fixed alternative with a firm
1:11:15
description of what each one of them was.
1:11:16
That took a long time to coalesce down to what an alternative was.
1:11:21
And then, there were some alternatives that sort of emerged at the very last
1:11:25
minute, “Alternative 9” being one of them.
1:11:28
[Alternative 9 was ultimately chosen]
1:11:29
So, anyway, I kind of segued or interrupted you a little bit when you
1:11:31
were talking about the White House getting back to you about alternatives?
1:11:35
I’m probably jumping ahead.
1:11:36
So, we ended up with this list of alternatives and they [White
1:11:40
House] came to us and said, “Alright, which is the best one?
1:11:45
Which one do you guys want to see?” And Jack was really good
1:11:48
about saying, “That’s not our job.
1:11:51
We’re describing the implications of each of these on various resources,
1:11:55
but it’s not going to be our job to tell you which one to pick.
1:11:58
That’s your job.” That was a real important distinction, and he was
1:12:03
really good about articulating that.
1:12:05
And that sort of served as a foundational principle ever since,
1:12:08
that we, as scientists, aren’t telling managers what to do.
1:12:11
We’re just saying, here’s the information to inform the consequences
1:12:19
of these different choices you have.
1:12:20
And that’s our role in providing that information.
1:12:26
The issues were already so hyper-politicized, did you sense any
1:12:31
kind of perceived bias beyond science and objective data, and some kind
1:12:37
of assessment based on that could be seen as problematic, on many fronts?
1:12:42
It
1:12:44
could, but we also realized that there are many ways you could interpret these
1:12:47
data and our choice isn’t necessarily any better than anybody else’s.
1:12:52
We know what the consequences are, but which consequence does
1:12:56
society think is more important?
1:12:57
Would you rather have higher viability [species] or higher timber volume?
1:13:02
And one time, I drew up a figure and it showed each alternative as a dot,
1:13:08
and on the x-axis were acres of forest protected, and on the y-axis was our
1:13:15
viability index, and they lined right up.
1:13:18
So, the higher the number of acres protected, the higher the viability.
1:13:24
Well, which one are you going to pick?
1:13:25
You either go for high viability or medium viability, it’s up to you.
1:13:29
Somewhere along that sliding scale, and it’s a social decision.
1:13:32
The higher you go toward viability, the lower you go toward timber
1:13:35
volume, and it’s a direct one-to-one tradeoff, basically.
1:13:39
How did Alternative 9 become the preferred alternative?
1:13:44
Actually, lot of that was the influence of Jerry Franklin,
1:13:49
because he came up with the concept of Adaptive Management Areas.
1:13:55
That provided this thought that we could have kind of a compromise
1:14:00
alternative out of those we had.
1:14:02
One alternative was called the “green dream,” which would protect all
1:14:05
existing late successional forests.
1:14:07
That was Alternative 1.
1:14:09
We had Alternative 7, which was the one that allowed for the highest
1:14:14
volume of timber harvest based on the recovery plan for the owl, which was
1:14:18
essentially mimicked on the ISC report.
1:14:22
So, the ISC led to the recovery plan, and that’s what the whole
1:14:25
and the EIS had been based on.
1:14:28
Anyway, that one allowed for the most volume.
1:14:31
Alternative 9 was a bit in-between.
1:14:33
It was a kind of a compromise, but it had this additional feature Jerry had
1:14:38
come up with, these Adaptive Management Areas, which would be these big reserve
1:14:43
areas set aside to provide for long-term experiments to test out alternative
1:14:51
approaches to forest management, and to evaluate how resources were used.
1:14:53
[Alternative 9 also included merging key watershed with Late Successional
1:14:53
Reserves [NWFP categories] to the extent possible – i.e., efficiency
1:14:53
in achieving aquatic and terrestrial objectives on the same land base.
1:14:53
See NWFP interview with John Gordon for more on subject.]
1:14:53
Essentially, what he’d been working on and what was by then called the “New Forestry”
1:14:59
concepts or paradigm, which meant experimenting with different treatment
1:15:05
methods and conservation dynamics.
1:15:07
Correct?
1:15:11
Yeah.
1:15:11
Okay.
1:15:11
That said, here’s one that allows for some flexibility with testing
1:15:14
new ideas and seeing how resources respond to those ideas, and it had
1:15:19
some appealing characteristics.
1:15:21
The fact that it was sort of a compromise in terms of the amount of the size
1:15:29
of these reserve systems, that it had this promise of adaptive management and
1:15:35
change into the future as we learn new things, and was a little more sensitive
1:15:40
to variation in management in the drier versus the wetter forest; all those
1:15:48
things kind of were part of Alternative 9 that made it attractive to the managers.
1:15:53
Plus, he [Franklin] really liked it, and he had the ear of many
1:15:58
of the congressional people.
1:16:00
Well, he was at the height of his, shall we say, “guru status” at that time. [Due
1:16:06
to Franklin’s expertise in ecological forestry and high profile role.]
1:16:07
Yeah, Congress loved him, and they would always ask his opinion on these things.
1:16:11
Jack said, we’re not going to tell you what our choice was, but Jerry didn’t have
1:16:14
any problem talking about the choice, so I’m sure he had a lot to do with extolling
1:16:19
the virtues of Alternative 9 back east.
1:16:23
How did the marbled murrelet get added?
1:16:26
How and when?
1:16:26
Well, it was there right from the get-go.
1:16:28
Okay.
1:16:28
If you look at the charter, it specifies.
1:16:31
Are you talking about the charter for FEMAT?
1:16:33
The charter for FEMAT.
1:16:35
But it wasn’t in ISC?
1:16:37
No.
1:16:38
That’s why I’m asking.
1:16:39
ISC was strictly a spotted owl plan.
1:16:39
I should have clarified in my question, that it was the
1:16:41
whole process, the continuum.
1:16:42
I know it was in here [FEMAT]
1:16:44
. So there was ISC, and then there was a problem with other species, low
1:16:49
viability ones, so then there was the Scientific Analysis Team, SAT, which
1:16:53
is the report you don’t have here.
1:16:55
But it was another one that Jack led.
1:16:57
I was the deputy leader of that one, too.
1:17:00
That’s where we did the forest, the first formal viability assessment
1:17:03
of marine to different kinds of forest management options.
1:17:07
In that report, we looked at all species, including marbled murrelet, and on the
1:17:12
marbled murrelet side, we brought in a special murrelet working group, people
1:17:17
who had started to study the murrelet.
1:17:19
And they brought in a set of tentative management guidelines for the murrelet.
1:17:23
Let’s see, the murrelet was listed in ’92, so
1:17:30
I think it had just been listed.
1:17:32
[At time of SAT]
1:17:32
. So, it was very recent, and the owl had been listed in different years,
1:17:34
depending on the agency, but it had been listed officially [ESA] by then.
1:17:38
In ’90, yeah.
1:17:38
’90?
1:17:38
I think.
1:17:39
Okay, yeah.
1:17:40
Either ’90 or ’91.
1:17:41
All right.
1:17:41
So, the
1:17:44
murrelet came along shortly thereafter, with the idea we needed to provide some
1:17:50
special management considerations for murrelets to be in that SAT report.
1:17:55
Then we had FEMAT, and in FEMAT, in terms of the viability assessments,
1:18:00
we focused on the listed species.
1:18:02
So, providing habitat that
1:18:09
would allow for viable populations of the spotted owls, that would allow for viable
1:18:11
populations of the murrelet, and then insofar as nesting habitat is concerned.
1:18:16
Because here is a sea bird [murrelet] that used the ocean
1:18:19
to feed, but the trees to breed.
1:18:21
And so, it was the nesting habitat that was going to be under the jurisdiction
1:18:27
of these alternative indices.
1:18:29
So, it was spotted owl, marbled murrelet, anadromous fish, and other
1:18:35
species associated with old forests.
1:18:38
Those groups were explicitly listed as things we needed to take care of
1:18:44
and keep track of in this process.
1:18:47
And so, Alternative 9 was accepted?
1:18:50
It was selected as the preferred alternative.
1:18:52
Preferred alternative, and that was incorporated into the Record of
1:18:57
Decision, Standards and Guidelines?
1:18:58
[rept.
1:18:58
to implement NWFP]
1:18:58
Yeah, except in the interim, when there was a final EIS.
1:19:02
Right.
1:19:03
Tell me about the EIS.
1:19:05
In the Final EIS, there was this evaluation of the effective environment,
1:19:10
and a detailed look at all other species associated with these old forests.
1:19:14
And under Alternative 9, there were species whose viability was
1:19:18
still at this medium to low level.
1:19:21
The lawyers who were working with us from the [U.S.] Department of Justice
1:19:24
said it’s not going to work if we have a plan that is not providing for higher
1:19:29
viability in these other species.
1:19:31
We needed to do something to provide higher assurances
1:19:37
for those species as well.
1:19:40
So, during the development of this final EIS, there was,
1:19:48
I forget the exact name of the group, but it was a “species assessment
1:19:51
group.” And there were some of us scientists involved with that group
1:19:56
as well, and I was one of them.
1:20:00
What we did was say, what would be needed in order to raise the
1:20:05
viability levels for those species that are otherwise at high viability?
1:20:10
And that led to this whole set of potential mitigations.
1:20:14
There was this whole list that was developed.
1:20:16
We just did report after report after report, and summary
1:20:19
after summary after summary.
1:20:20
But we ended up with this matrix of all these mitigations, like increasing the
1:20:25
width of riparian buffers, providing for greater amounts of downed wood
1:20:29
during harvest operations, allowing for
1:20:35
higher retention of green trees in clear-cuts; just a whole bunch of
1:20:40
different things that, each one was designed to provide something essential to
1:20:45
the long-term persistence of each of these 990 other species associated with old
1:20:51
forests that needed additional protection.
1:20:53
So,
1:20:58
there was this big matrix [not zoning category] , and then,
1:21:01
Alternative 9 was tweaked to provide for these additional mitigations.
1:21:06
Are you talking about the Matrix, as the land [allocation] was
1:21:09
called, or are you talking about a matrix in a different sense?
1:21:11
I’m talking about like a computer matrix now, a different sense.
1:21:14
Okay, got you.
1:21:15
I just wanted to be clear for the record.
1:21:18
Let’s call it a spreadsheet.
1:21:19
It was a spreadsheet that had—
1:21:21
Continue.
1:21:22
So, we had a spreadsheet.
1:21:27
The EIS has these appendices, and one of the appendices is this spreadsheet that
1:21:32
shows all the different mitigations, and there were like thirty of them.
1:21:37
Then, the species were all in rows in this spreadsheet, and there
1:21:40
was little digits that showed that this species is benefitted by that
1:21:45
mitigation, or this one or that one.
1:21:50
Then we did a synthesis of all that stuff and developed a reduced set of
1:21:55
mitigations that together would provide reasonable assurance of likelihood of
1:22:00
persistence of these other species.
1:22:03
That became the real embodiment of option [Alternative] 9, which is
1:22:06
different from the one that was in FEMAT.
1:22:10
Jack and Jerry and other people were livid about this.
1:22:14
They just felt like, and Jack’s expression was, “Alright, we just
1:22:19
pulled off the greatest train robbery in history, and now you’re going around
1:22:22
stealing their watches and jewels.” So, he thought it was just, like trivial,
1:22:29
to screw around with all these other mitigations when we’d had this huge plan.
1:22:35
And isn’t that also what led Jack to say that he thought that “survey
1:22:39
and manage” might be the death of this thing, in terms of it being an
1:22:44
effective plan, especially in terms of meeting the timber projections?
1:22:48
Yeah.
1:22:49
Okay.
1:22:49
He was really upset about it.
1:22:52
All those mitigations, and “survey and manage” became the
1:22:55
embodiment of those mitigations.
1:22:57
And one of those big ones was to look for where, when all else failed,
1:23:01
look for where the species occurs and come up with a management plan to
1:23:04
address the needs of those species.
1:23:06
Survey and manage.
1:23:09
So, that was the last item that provided, that bumped those species
1:23:13
up from medium to low viability, to high viability, to put them in place.
1:23:18
But yeah, economically, it was a real killer, because it made
1:23:23
it almost impossible to meet the timber [cut level] , as they call
1:23:29
it, PSQ, Probable Sale Quantity.
1:23:31
We had an estimate of X billion board-feet that would emerge out of [Alternative]
1:23:35
option 9, but by the time you later did all these other mitigations, that
1:23:40
plummeted to a much smaller number than what was originally promised.
1:23:46
Returning to the pink tower and that whole experience, do you have any stories
1:23:51
or memories of Jack or Jerry or any meetings or humor, anger, I mean, just
1:23:58
memorable things that happened out of that very unique moment in natural resource
1:24:03
management history in this country?
1:24:04
Oh, yeah.
1:24:05
I mean, anything else that you remember that is worthy for the
1:24:08
record, for a number of reasons?
1:24:11
I don’t know.
1:24:11
R-rated or otherwise.
1:24:13
[Laughs]
1:24:15
I remember one time, we did allow a reporter, and, I can’t remember her name.
1:24:21
She was an environmental reporter for the Oregonian, a really good one.
1:24:25
She ended up working with NPR, maybe it was Elizabeth Arnold.
1:24:28
I think it was Elizabeth Arnold.
1:24:29
She’s still with NPR, isn’t she?
1:24:32
She might be.
1:24:32
She kind of dropped out of sight for a little bit.
1:24:36
No, it wasn’t Elizabeth Arnold.
1:24:37
She did stories on this, but no, it’s another one [possibly Kathy
1:24:41
Durbin] . Anyway, this is toward the end, and he [Jack Ward Thomas]
1:24:45
allowed her to do an interview.
1:24:47
He was talking about the gravity of this, the awesome responsibility all of us had
1:24:52
in putting forth such a bold plan, and
1:24:57
well, we’re saying we are just “quaking in our boots.” But that got translated
1:25:03
by some of our team to “quaking in our Birkenstocks.” We just loved
1:25:06
that expression, “We’re quaking in our Birkenstocks.” And we started
1:25:10
posting it up all over the place.
1:25:12
And we had little posters made out of it.
1:25:15
It was just the funniest thing ever.
1:25:17
[Laughs]
1:25:18
That’s perfect, actually.
1:25:19
It was really good.
1:25:23
I also remember there was a lawyer who was challenging FEMAT and this
1:25:30
whole process that worked for the Oregon Forest Industries Council.
1:25:36
God, his name is escaping me, too.
1:25:38
I wish I could remember it.
1:25:41
Because that’s the pro-industry group, correct?
1:25:43
Yeah, the pro-industry group.
1:25:45
And he got, under some sort of FOIA, got a hold of internal emails that
1:25:52
had been circulating among all of us during the process, and pulled
1:25:56
up one where one of our members,
1:26:01
her name was Pat, was saying, “Why can’t we just pick the `green dream’?”
1:26:06
And this was a letter from her to Jack and they picked this up and then
1:26:11
talked about it in court. Here’s this email proving that this FEMAT team
1:26:16
just wanted to save all the forest and they were interested in nothing else.
1:26:20
You know, “why can’t we have the green dream?” [Environmentally-friendly
1:26:24
alternative] . That came back to haunt us over and over and over again.
1:26:27
Without help from Russian hackers, by the way.
1:26:30
That’s true.
1:26:31
I had to throw that in.
1:26:32
Sorry, for the record there.
1:26:37
[Laughs] So, but you were basically cloistered, it was
1:26:40
science people almost exclusively.
1:26:42
Right?
1:26:42
It was, almost exclusively.
1:26:43
There was some administration people?
1:26:45
Not really, right?
1:26:46
Not really.
1:26:47
Didn’t they have to wear special uniforms, like upper management and
1:26:51
other “big shots” that had to come in, almost like they were a traffic
1:26:56
cone walking through the room?
1:26:58
They had a special credential and permit to go in that building, and
1:27:01
the managers were not part of it.
1:27:02
There was this whole thing that this was going to be a science-based effort,
1:27:04
managers have just screwed it up to this point, and we need to focus on science.
1:27:04
Because if we bring the managers in, this is going to be
1:27:13
too hard, as they’re going to impose all these
1:27:17
things, put sideboards on thinking and they’d have these blinders
1:27:21
on, and wouldn’t be open to radical, new ways of managing.
1:27:25
So, the decision right from the get-go was supported by the administration.
1:27:30
And I mean Clinton, that this is going to
1:27:35
be a science-based effort developed by scientists.
1:27:39
That was a huge decision with big implications, and
1:27:43
never has been done since.
1:27:45
From then, it’s always been a joint science and management partnership.
1:27:48
Could you sense the tension, though, from the outside?
1:27:51
Oh, definitely.
1:27:52
Or did you get calls and emails?
1:27:55
No, everybody was suspicious of what we were doing, and would come to the
1:27:58
managers later on, who started talking about, or sort of giving updates, but
1:28:02
you could tell, they were worried, “Oh, my God, these people are just going to
1:28:05
kill us.” And, “what are you doing?” But,
1:28:11
really worried about how life was going to change, which it did
1:28:14
drastically, everybody’s life changed.
1:28:16
The Olympic [National] Forest went from a big timber forest to essentially
1:28:21
zero timber, because everything was in reserve on the Olympic Forest.
1:28:26
Had they been involved, that never would have happened.
1:28:28
They would have said, “Oh, no, we’ve got to have at least this and that
1:28:32
and the other thing.” So yeah, I’d wake up at night thinking about
1:28:38
that, “Oh, my God, we’re completely changed the direction of forestry in
1:28:41
the Pacific Northwest.” The Pacific Northwest, the timber “bread basket.”
1:28:46
Well, at least post-World War II.
1:28:48
Yeah, right.
1:28:49
I mean, it’s interesting to think about the history of the U.S. of how forestry
1:28:54
and conservation kind of jumped across from the East to the upper Midwest,
1:28:59
and the dynamics of scarcity and the cultural shifts kind of followed each
1:29:04
other, and then of course, it really crystallized in the post-modern era with
1:29:09
the environmental age, when you had a paradigm shift across, philosophical,
1:29:15
cultural and political lines.
1:29:17
Not just in select areas, and a much more limited humanistic-centered,
1:29:23
shall we say, paradigm.
1:29:25
Yeah, and you think of nationally, for
1:29:30
that period of time, the Pacific Northwest was producing all the wood.
1:29:33
And now it’s like the Southwest U.S., so there’s this huge shift
1:29:36
in economic balance that resulted.
1:29:41
Yeah.
1:29:42
So, you come out with this;
1:29:47
the Clinton administration signed off on Alternative 9?
1:29:51
[Bottom line was to get Judge William Dwyer to sign off that
1:29:53
plan met standards of the ESA.]
1:29:53
Yes.
1:29:53
What was the initial fallout or positives, depending on which
1:29:58
crowd you’re speaking about,
1:30:01
basically, when this came out?
1:30:02
[NWFP-Alternative]
1:30:04
Right.
1:30:05
What do you remember about reactions within the Forest Service, but also
1:30:10
the broader community, including timber interests and environmentalists?
1:30:12
Well, there was an immediate lawsuit, of course, as the timber industry
1:30:16
filed suit right off the bat.
1:30:17
Day one, probably.
1:30:19
Huh?
1:30:20
Day one, probably, or almost.
1:30:21
Day one, the minute it came out.
1:30:24
Then the environmental community, we just heard scores of people on the
1:30:30
environmental side saying, “Fantastic, this is what we’ve been needing and this
1:30:34
is what we wanted.” And so, they became, what’s called, a “friend of the court.”
1:30:43
They defended along with the Forest Service, and were our co-defendants in
1:30:51
what was going on.
1:30:51
Right.
1:30:51
We all then participated as witnesses as
1:30:57
the court proceedings went through, called upon to testify and talk about aspects
1:31:02
of this plan, and what we were doing.
1:31:06
There was all kinds of legal maneuvering that happened right after this came
1:31:12
out, and we were all involved with that.
1:31:13
Then, there was tons of work to translate all of this into actual
1:31:19
on-the-ground practice, and to determine what does it really mean.
1:31:21
What did you mean by this?
1:31:23
What did you mean by that?
1:31:23
What does it mean, fifteen percent?
1:31:25
How’s that fifteen percent distributed?
1:31:27
Is it all in one spot or is it spread out all over?
1:31:30
This is the what-ifs for the timber interests, right?
1:31:32
Yeah, and the environmental side.
1:31:34
Both.
1:31:35
But also, all the managers.
1:31:36
The managers needed to know, how we actually do this, and what
1:31:39
they were supposed to do now.
1:31:40
They needed help in interpreting what the intent was within these
1:31:44
documents, to put in practice.
1:31:47
So, for years afterwards, there were a bunch of us constantly involved
1:31:52
with various committees and projects to provide additional guidance.
1:31:58
It went on for years and years.
1:32:00
Any particular dynamic or even case you can speak about, that you
1:32:04
remember testifying about, or a
1:32:07
particular incident, dynamic or a challenge that was particularly memorable,
1:32:13
or illustrative of something important?
1:32:19
The ones I remember are ones I wasn’t involved with.
1:32:22
But remember, I mentioned Barry Noon, who was one of the scientists
1:32:25
involved with the ISC report.
1:32:28
Those lawyers had grilled him, because a lot of the basis for the reserve
1:32:35
design was work that he and his colleagues had done modeling spotted
1:32:39
owls and how they would respond to various sizes of these reserve systems.
1:32:45
The idea that came out of the modeling was that you needed to have somewhere in the
1:32:48
neighborhood of fifteen pairs, an area of land large enough to support fifteen or
1:32:53
more pairs that would be able to interact with each other, to assure reproduction,
1:33:00
adequate fecundity and persistence.
1:33:04
But the lawyers got a hold of that and were trying to grill him on, how
1:33:09
could you just say that that is true?
1:33:12
And they were trying to get him to make these on-the-fly calculations
1:33:17
about—I forget exactly what it was, like, if you have a survival rate of
1:33:23
.85 and fecundity of .25, what would be the lambda, the rate of population
1:33:31
growth that would emerge from that.
1:33:32
Barry would say, “I’m not to just calculate something on-the-fly here
1:33:36
in front of you, it’s too easy to make a mistake. Well, it’s not that hard.
1:33:40
I mean, you have this number and you multiply this one times that one, and
1:33:42
you get a result, and what’s that result?
1:33:44
“I’m not going to say, I’m not going to do it.” I just loved how he was so
1:33:48
adamant and just didn’t allow himself to get pushed around by these lawyers
1:33:52
to try to come up with something that could then be maybe proven to be wrong
1:33:56
later, or something and about having a chance to go back to his lab and do it
1:34:01
right. So, that was really cool. I’ll never forget that series of episodes.
1:34:07
So,
1:34:10
the Record of Decision, Standards and Guidelines comes out in ’94, I believe?
1:34:14
Yeah.
1:34:15
And then the final report to Congress and the President, came out in
1:34:18
early ’95, essentially, a published, crystallized version of this.
1:34:25
So,
1:34:29
actually, we’re going to take a little break from that.
1:34:32
I want to go back to that and talk about how the science and monitoring
1:34:38
dynamic that came after that, but I’d like to go back to the murrelet.
1:34:44
Tell me about this bird.
1:34:46
I mean, why is it important?
1:34:50
We know it’s a sea bird, it’s kind of on the western side
1:34:53
of this whole greater region.
1:34:56
Just tell us about the murrelet?
1:34:59
Well, it’s a really mysterious bird.
1:35:01
And you may know that scientists and ornithologists had known
1:35:06
about the murrelet for centuries.
1:35:08
They’d see this bird out on the water, but no one knew where the heck it nested.
1:35:13
So, they called it the fog bird, because sometimes they’d see it
1:35:16
sort of disappearing into the fog, but they had no idea where it went.
1:35:20
Did it have a reputation among old mariners and stuff
1:35:26
like that?
1:35:26
It was a well-known bird in the oceans.
1:35:28
Okay.
1:35:29
It was well-described.
1:35:31
Audubon described it and showed it, they have this illustration of a murrelet
1:35:36
standing on a rock, of all things.
1:35:39
Joseph Grinnell, a famous ornithologist and zoologist
1:35:45
from U.C. Berkeley, described his efforts to try to figure out where
1:35:50
the murrelet went to nest, and he never did have any success with it.
1:35:55
It wasn’t until 1974 that the first murrelet nest was actually discovered.
1:35:59
So, here is this bird that we’ve known about essentially as long as
1:36:02
ornithologists have been around, but in 1974, the first nest was discovered,
1:36:06
and it was discovered by accident.
1:36:09
A tree-climber was pruning limbs on a tree in Big Basin Redwoods State
1:36:14
Park in California [east of Santa Cruz] , cut off a limb, and there
1:36:18
was this web-footed bird sitting on the branch that he was about to cut.
1:36:25
He knew enough to collect it and show it to an expert, and the guy said,
1:36:29
“That’s the marbled murrelet.” And then they realized that’s where we
1:36:34
need to look for them, and then they discovered that’s where it nests.
1:36:37
But everything about that bird, the reason the nests took so long to
1:36:40
find is that the birds do everything they can to hide themselves.
1:36:45
They fly into the forest at night.
1:36:48
They fly back out before dawn.
1:36:51
They have cryptic coloration, they’re sort of dark brown colored, and they blend
1:36:55
right in with the branches of the trees.
1:36:59
Their eggs are inconspicuous.
1:37:02
They don’t build big nests or anything.
1:37:04
So, it’s almost impossible to find the nest of it unless
1:37:08
you really know where to look.
1:37:09
Who is their biggest predator?
1:37:12
Well, at different stages of the life cycle, there are different predators.
1:37:15
So, on the adults, bald eagles are probably the most frequent predator,
1:37:20
but p eregrine falcons and cooper’s hawks, sharp-shinned hawks will
1:37:24
grab them, great-horned owls will.
1:37:27
But the biggest mortality effect is nested depredation,
1:37:32
and that’s jays and crows primarily, that find the eggs.
1:37:37
Scavengers, right, right.
1:37:39
And they do it, the thought is, they’re not searching for murrelet
1:37:43
eggs, they just happen to see them.
1:37:46
What is the average height of their nests usually?
1:37:49
A hundred feet.
1:37:50
So, pretty far up?
1:37:51
Yeah, so they nest way up in the trees.
1:37:53
Spruce and fir both?
1:37:55
Conifers in general.
1:37:56
Right.
1:37:57
Almost zero nests in any kind of hardwood tree.
1:37:59
There has been one nest in a maple that had been discovered.
1:38:02
Was that because of height, because the other trees are higher?
1:38:08
It may be having to do with the nature of the limbs, as having horizontal limbs
1:38:13
is really important, because they lay an egg, and it’s a single egg on a limb.
1:38:18
They sort of scrape out a little depression in whatever
1:38:23
epiphytes are there, moss that might be developing on the limb.
1:38:26
So, it’s a real important feature in their nesting habitat.
1:38:29
They are only able to lay one egg at a time, and it’s on those horizontal
1:38:34
limbs, so conifers are the ones that provide that kind of limb, generally.
1:38:38
You would think there would be odd situations where a hardwood might do
1:38:41
that, but they don’t pick hardwoods.
1:38:47
The trees are generally huge in stature, but there have been
1:38:51
nests known in smaller trees.
1:38:52
How far from the coastline usually do they like to nest?
1:38:55
How far inland?
1:38:56
It varies north and south along the range.
1:39:00
First of all, this tree nesting behavior is the murrelet in the Pacific Northwest,
1:39:05
but as you get further north, they start nesting on the ground, especially
1:39:08
when you’re in Alaska in the Aleutian Islands, where they also occur.
1:39:12
There are no trees and there, the nests would be on the ground.
1:39:16
And then it becomes kind of a mixture in northern Alaska, and it then
1:39:20
becomes more and more strictly tree nesting as you get into our area.
1:39:23
And then their predators change, though, when they’re on
1:39:25
the ground though, obviously.
1:39:26
Oh, yeah.
1:39:26
So,
1:39:30
they fly at different distances away from the coast to nest, in this area in
1:39:35
Washington, up to fifty miles inland.
1:39:38
When you’re down in California toward the southern part of the
1:39:40
extent of their range, it’s more like ten to twenty-five miles.
1:39:44
So, we think it has to do with the extent of the fog zone.
1:39:49
It’s that foggy, moist environment that provides the epiphytes that help augment
1:39:56
the nesting capability on these limbs.
1:39:58
Do you think it’s also a camouflage, recognition of the camouflage?
1:40:02
Not so much, I think it’s really just having the right
1:40:04
-- Or cover, shall I say, would be better.
1:40:06
Well, cover’s an important attribute.
1:40:08
I mean, the cover of fog.
1:40:10
I don’t think that’s it.
1:40:12
But it’s the moisture and the plants that result from that dynamic.
1:40:18
Yes?
1:40:18
The thing is that they nest at all distances away from the shore up to
1:40:23
this fifty-mile limit, so they’ll nest sometimes fairly close to the marine
1:40:27
environment, sometimes very far.
1:40:29
But in the studies I’ve done where we’ve put telemetry on the birds and actually
1:40:34
found their nests from the telemetry, all of the birds we found nested deep
1:40:39
within—well, we caught birds around the Olympic Peninsula, in the waters on the
1:40:43
outer coast of Washington, and then the Hood Canal and Strait of Juan de Fuca.
1:40:48
So, we’ve captured birds in waters surrounding the Olympic Peninsula.
1:40:52
Where they nested was deep within the Olympic National Park.
1:40:56
To do that, they flew over lots of what looks like suitable habitat,
1:41:00
private land and forest land, but they went way into the park.
1:41:06
Why they do that is a bit of a mystery.
1:41:08
Why do they pass over apparently suitable habitat to get further away?
1:41:12
One thought is that because nest depredation is such a big thing, that
1:41:16
there are fewer predators in some of these more inland higher elevation forests
1:41:21
than lower elevation areas further down.
1:41:24
Well, you’re closer to more human-impacted areas where you might have higher
1:41:28
scavenger population densities, correct?
1:41:31
That is a big factor.
1:41:34
These jays and crows are attracted to the human activity because humans leave
1:41:38
behind other foods that they like to eat.
1:41:40
Where there’s more people, there’s more crows.
1:41:42
And so, yes, there is a higher risk in areas around human habitation.
1:41:47
So, that’s definitely part of the situation as well.
1:41:52
What’s their life expectancy average?
1:41:56
Probably five years, but they live up to ten to fifteen years.
1:42:03
There have been zero studies of birds in captivity that show the full
1:42:08
extent of their life history, but just given a bird that size, and what
1:42:12
you’d expect for a bird that size.
1:42:13
What is their average size, male and female?
1:42:16
They’re 200 grams, which would be a little bit smaller than a robin, let’s say.
1:42:21
A male is
1:42:25
220, females are about 200.
1:42:26
And
1:42:28
how long before the young leave the nest?
1:42:31
A single egg, right?
1:42:33
So, the egg takes thirty days of incubation, then, thirty
1:42:36
days of fledgling development.
1:42:41
So, sixty-days total.
1:42:42
The thing that’s interesting, they start at different times of the year, so it’s
1:42:47
what’s called asynchronous breeding where some birds will start in, start
1:42:53
laying an egg in April, others in May.
1:42:55
So, you end up with this progression of nests throughout this longer
1:43:00
breeding season, sixty days at a time, but at different starting renewals.
1:43:05
Now, Alternative 9, let’s go from that.
1:43:09
How did the comparative protection measures in areas and geographies
1:43:14
compare between the owl and the murrelet, in terms of how good
1:43:19
this was for either or for both?
1:43:24
Well, first of all, the murrelet range is a subset of the spotted owl range.
1:43:29
They do cross-over quite a bit.
1:43:31
I mean, they overlap, yeah.
1:43:32
Totally.
1:43:33
Yeah.
1:43:33
Because the spotted owl goes right to the coast in some cases.
1:43:37
Correct?
1:43:37
Right.
1:43:37
So, the range, the extent, the boundary of the Northwest Forest
1:43:42
Plan, is the range of the spotted owl.
1:43:44
That’s how it was defined.
1:43:46
Right.
1:43:47
Within that range, the coastal half of it is marbled murrelet,
1:43:52
potential marbled murrelet habitat.
1:43:57
The big difference, for spotted owls, their whole life history is
1:44:01
in the forest, so they nest in the forest, they feed in the forest.
1:44:03
Everything they do is within a home range that’s totally
1:44:06
contained within the forest.
1:44:08
With the murrelet, it’s commuting back-and-forth.
1:44:10
It’s feeding in the ocean, and then it’s commuting in, only to nest.
1:44:15
So, the habitat requirements are, it’s a nesting habitat requirement
1:44:20
within the forested lands.
1:44:21
There’s nothing about foraging.
1:44:23
Whereas, spotted owls, there is a consideration for where they forage.
1:44:27
What happens, for example, is in the southern part of the range where
1:44:31
spotted owls forage on woodrats a lot, woodrats actually reach their peak
1:44:36
abundance in cut-over forest that has a real strong brushy component, where
1:44:42
if you haven’t used insecticides and haven’t done all these treatments
1:44:46
and just let a recently cut over or burned area recover, it becomes a
1:44:49
really diverse, early seral system.
1:44:53
That’s really good woodrat habitat.
1:44:56
So, spotted owls there do really well where there is old forest for nesting
1:45:01
next to young forest for foraging, young as well, as it has that brushy cover.
1:45:07
For murrelets, the brushy stuff is really bad because not only is it
1:45:12
not nesting habitat, but it’s an area that supports higher numbers of
1:45:17
especially jays, that like the insects and berries in the brushy areas.
1:45:21
What do they like to eat?
1:45:21
What are their favorite foods?
1:45:24
Of the murrelets?
1:45:25
Yeah, I didn’t ask that.
1:45:25
They eat small-sized fishes that would include sand lance, juvenile
1:45:31
rock fish, anchovies, and herring.
1:45:36
Smelt?
1:45:37
Yeah, they’ll take smelt.
1:45:38
Not a big one in their diet, in the studies that have been done, but their
1:45:42
big one is sand lance, that’s like the key, and then capelin, is another one.
1:45:45
But then the so-called candlefish, these little long, narrow fish
1:45:49
like if you picture an anchovy,
1:45:52
that’s their thing.
1:45:53
What’s interesting about them is they’ll catch and bring to the nest, one fish.
1:45:58
They’re not like some other sea birds that load up with like ten
1:46:00
fish, and bring it to the nest and dump a whole pile on the chick.
1:46:04
It’s one fish.
1:46:05
Fly twenty-five miles with one fish?
1:46:05
So, they’ll go out there, they’ll fly fifty miles with one fish and
1:46:09
give it to that chick, and then fly back and get another one the next
1:46:14
night, so it’s really something.
1:46:16
In other words, they’re in great shape.
1:46:18
[Laughs]
1:46:20
The energetics of that bird are really amazing because it’s a diving
1:46:24
sea bird, so its body design is oriented toward swimming underwater.
1:46:28
It’s not really highly maneuverable
1:46:31
in the air, but yet, they fly tremendous distances, and manage to maneuver in
1:46:36
the forest to land on a little limb in the dark, which is a pretty good feat.
1:46:42
Navigationally, I don’t know how they do it.
1:46:44
Nobody knows.
1:46:45
But they find that limb and land on it.
1:46:49
Some people say they crash land into it, because like I said, they’re not
1:46:52
really maneuverable, and they don’t have really a good ability to take off.
1:46:56
Because they’re really meant
1:47:00
for diving for fish?
1:47:01
Right?
1:47:01
Yeah, exactly.
1:47:02
Their body is really designed for that.
1:47:05
And yet, they have this ability to fly tremendous distances at really high
1:47:08
speed, too, so they’re fast flyers.
1:47:10
They’re one of our fastest birds out there.
1:47:11
Almost like a swallow, correct?
1:47:13
Oh, way faster.
1:47:15
Faster?
1:47:15
Some of the
1:47:19
water fowl and band-tail pigeons are the only other birds that fly that fast.
1:47:23
So, one of the ways we studied murrelets, is with radar.
1:47:25
We put radars out, these marine-like radars mounted on truck, and go to a
1:47:33
drainage, set up the radar, start it spinning, and watch for the blips of
1:47:38
birds flying in on the radar signature.
1:47:42
And when you see a whole series of blips moving at really fast speed, then you
1:47:46
know that’s likely to be a murrelet.
1:47:47
If it’s a straight line and really fast, it’s a murrelet.
1:47:51
So, how do you capture them?
1:47:53
Well, you have to go out on the ocean.
1:47:56
You go on a boat.
1:47:58
Hopefully, it’s a boat that has the right kind of a bow that doesn’t make
1:48:01
a lot of noise, but you sneak up on them on the water with a salmon net.
1:48:06
And you pull them in underwater and lift it [the net] up under the bird
1:48:12
and then scoop them out of the water.
1:48:13
You’ve got to go out in the middle of the night, in total blackness.
1:48:16
If there’s a high moon, it doesn’t work, because they see you coming.
1:48:20
And it’s really hard to do, but that’s the only successful way.
1:48:23
Now, you can catch them with mist-nets, too.
1:48:25
You put out these nets like you use for other birds, and if you can find a flyway
1:48:31
that they’re likely to occur in, you can string a net across and catch them or
1:48:35
suspend these things out on the water.
1:48:37
But it’s really difficult.
1:48:39
The more consistent way of doing this, is this dip-netting technique, what it’s
1:48:45
called when you just go out with a net.
1:48:47
I love doing that, by the way, it’s really fun.
1:48:49
You still do it?
1:48:51
I haven’t for a couple years now.
1:48:53
The last time I did it was, 2000, well, it’s been a lot of years now, 2008.
1:48:55
We are
1:48:58
about to start another study this coming summer where we’re going to do it again.
1:49:02
So, where else does the murrelet appear in the world?
1:49:06
The marbled murrelet?
1:49:07
Or relatives, close relatives.
1:49:08
The marbled murrelet is found from southern California, the Santa Cruz
1:49:14
area, up to the Aleutian Islands, strictly along the Pacific coast.
1:49:18
There is a long-billed murrelet that occurs over in Japan
1:49:22
that sometimes occurs here.
1:49:23
So, it’s the Pacific Rim, basically.
1:49:26
Yeah.
1:49:27
And there is the “ancient murrelet,” that is mostly in Canada, but a little bit down
1:49:32
here. And there’s other murrelets, but the marbled murrelet is a West Coast bird.
1:49:39
Can we take another break?
1:49:41
[Break in Audio]
1:49:41
Anyway, we’re going to pick up again after a brief break.
1:49:44
And Marty’s going to continue on talking about murrelets
1:49:48
and life cycles and the like.
1:49:52
Yeah, so its life, its
1:49:58
ecology, is pretty much set by the need to be cryptic, meaning
1:50:02
to hide really well and avoid the risk of the loss of its nests,
1:50:07
because it only lays one egg a year.
1:50:09
The loss of that one egg is sort of devastating; it’s done for the year.
1:50:14
There is some evidence that they can re-nest if one loses an egg early.
1:50:19
But most of the time, they just have one shot each year, so their
1:50:22
reproductive rate is really low.
1:50:27
And as a result, their recruitment rate is really low, and that’s one
1:50:31
of the reasons why the population seems to be declining over time.
1:50:35
Now, vis-à-vis the lawsuit situation, how many lawsuits were there over
1:50:40
murrelets in comparison to spotted owls, or did they just kind of generalize
1:50:45
about any of the listed species?
1:50:48
Yeah, it was kind of generalized.
1:50:50
The primary impetus for those early lawsuits was the spotted owl,
1:50:54
and the marbled murrelet didn’t feature at all in those early days.
1:50:57
Now, a lot of the lawsuits are coming out about the murrelet.
1:51:01
So, because we have this huge plan with a spotted owl focus, there’s a
1:51:06
little more attention on murrelets because there’s some areas that are
1:51:10
sort of a gap in the distribution of the birds where the federal lands are
1:51:15
insufficient to provide for habitat over the long-run, like southwest Washington.
1:51:21
Like you can see right there [on map] , this whole area has no federal land.
1:51:24
That’s the place where the murrelet occurs right along there.
1:51:26
There’s no federal land.
1:51:28
It’s all up to the state and the private lands.
1:51:31
If those habitats aren’t protected in various ways, there could be big gaps
1:51:36
in distributions of the birds that could have long-term negative effects.
1:51:40
I’m going to use the term “matrix,” not to describe Matrix lands in the
1:51:44
Northwest Forest Plan, but in terms of the matrix or matrices of different
1:51:49
management components; state, private, federal. Is the one that you’re
1:51:55
describing in southwest Washington the biggest gap, or are there equally
1:52:00
problematic ones as you go down into Oregon and northern California?
1:52:03
Well, there’s a big gap that occurs in southwest Washington
1:52:07
and also one in northern Oregon.
1:52:08
Then you have the Siuslaw [National] Forest and a big batch
1:52:11
of federal lands in central Oregon.
1:52:14
Then there’s a little bit of a gap as you get toward California again.
1:52:17
And then when you leave San Francisco, there’s no more federal land.
1:52:24
Until down in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara, right?
1:52:27
Down that way?
1:52:27
Right, and then you have some state parks that are a big part
1:52:30
of the habitat, such as Big Basin State Park down in Santa Cruz.
1:52:34
But, it’s outside of the jurisdiction of the Northwest Forest Plan because
1:52:38
it’s outside of the range of the spotted owl, so there’s no forest plan
1:52:42
protection for that part of the range between Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
1:52:46
What’s the communication dynamic between state foresters and federal
1:52:50
foresters regarding these kinds of issues, from what you know?
1:52:53
You’re up in Washington here, but you know about Oregon, too, and California.
1:52:57
For one thing, there was a science assessment done for murrelets in
1:53:03
Washington, and in that assessment, the state did everything they could to build
1:53:10
on the protections of the federal lands.
1:53:12
So, wherever state lands were close to federal lands, that became an
1:53:16
area where maybe there was the best opportunity to provide for murrelet
1:53:21
habitat, because it would build on to federal protections and create an
1:53:26
opportunity for a bigger patch of habitat, state lands juxtaposed with federal.
1:53:32
There was a lot of interaction between federal and state biologists
1:53:36
developing those strategies.
1:53:42
In Oregon, there hasn’t been quite that same level of interaction and cooperation.
1:53:50
Also in Oregon, there hasn’t been such commitment to protection of murrelets
1:53:53
as there has been in Washington.
1:53:56
The Washington DNR is just in the process of developing a long-term conservation
1:54:00
strategy for marbled murrelets, and they did a big assessment to evaluate
1:54:06
the viability implications -- just like the FEMAT report -- different reserve
1:54:12
strategies for murrelet habitat in Washington and evaluate how murrelets
1:54:17
would fare under each of those [options] . They’re just finishing that work.
1:54:23
They’re going to be doing an EIS on it pretty soon.
1:54:26
But the environmental community is all lined up ready to file lawsuits
1:54:30
and challenge the state on their protections, thinking that it’s
1:54:33
insufficient protection of habitat to ensure viability of murrelets.
1:54:38
They’ve been really active in challenging the state DNR on the things
1:54:43
they propose to do for murrelets.
1:54:45
Traditionally, even in the environmental age, state agencies have tended to be
1:54:51
much more industry-centered than federal agencies, at least since the ‘60s or ‘70s?
1:54:58
Right?
1:54:58
Right.
1:54:59
Post-1970.
1:55:00
So, even if it’s not industry-centered, the state lands have a big fiduciary
1:55:04
responsibility to provide money from these trust lands for schools and universities.
1:55:10
Exactly.
1:55:10
And so, they have a huge interest in maintaining the economic
1:55:16
benefits of logging forests in Washington on state lands.
1:55:23
That’s a big deal.
1:55:24
So it makes it really difficult to envision increased protection
1:55:28
for murrelets at the risk of reducing funds to schools.
1:55:28
It’s
1:55:31
a huge issue.
1:55:36
Monitoring was required by the Northwest Forest Plan and
1:55:39
associated laws, and includes three main components: implementation,
1:55:43
effectiveness, and validation.
1:55:45
How would you describe these concepts in their application to the components
1:55:49
of the Northwest Forest Plan regarding old-growth late-successional
1:55:52
forests, aquatic habitats, riparian systems, the spotted owl and marbled
1:55:55
murrelet, and the continuum of other, shall we say, threatened
1:56:01
or endangered species or habitats?
1:56:04
Well, there’s a lot to that question.
1:56:06
First of all, in the d ecision that Dwyer made upholding the Northwest Forest Plan,
1:56:12
he specifically said that with this plan,
1:56:17
we are upholding this decision so long as you do what you said you were going
1:56:22
to do, which includes effectiveness monitoring so that you know the plan is
1:56:25
doing what you said it was going to do.
1:56:26
To the extent that if that monitoring were to cease, then we’d have to revisit
1:56:31
whether the Northwest Forest Plan really is meeting the standards of law.
1:56:37
So, it was built right into the court decision, and that put a lot of impetus
1:56:41
on the agencies to continue monitoring.
1:56:44
Because it’s been a huge program, a multimillion dollar program
1:56:48
which is unprecedented in natural resource management, to invest
1:56:51
that much in a monitoring effort.
1:56:54
So, as you could tell from these various reports, that these
1:56:57
monitoring plans are involved.
1:56:58
Yeah, the one you’re looking at is the fifteen-year.
1:57:00
And there was also
1:57:02
— Well, this is the actual monitoring plan.
1:57:04
[Reviewing NWFP reports]
1:57:04
That’s the one that came out in ’99.
1:57:05
Correct?
1:57:07
There was a whole group of teams, and each team produced one of these reports.
1:57:13
Either the spotted owl, the murrelet, old-growth late
1:57:16
successional forests, aquatic, etc.?
1:57:18
[Subjects for U.S. Forest Service teams/reports on NWFP.]
1:57:18
Yeah, “etcetera” pretty much ends there, though, because
1:57:22
there was never a monitoring plan for other associated species.
1:57:25
The survey and manage stuff?
1:57:26
Yeah, there’s no monitoring associated.
1:57:28
For the mollusks and slugs and invertebrates and all the other stuff?
1:57:33
Effectiveness monitoring ended with the listed species and aquatic systems, and
1:57:37
the late successional old-growth system.
1:57:40
Biodiversity was an important component of the plan, but that
1:57:44
monitoring never really developed.
1:57:46
So, that’s been the struggle ever since.
1:57:52
These things are really expensive, and it’s been a
1:57:56
struggle every year to fund them.
1:57:59
There have been attempts to cut it back, and some of those
1:58:01
attempts have been successful.
1:58:03
For example, murrelet monitoring that I’m intimately involved in, we
1:58:08
started out monitoring every one of the so-called conservation zones.
1:58:13
There’s six zones defined in the recovery plan for the murrelet.
1:58:18
Five of those occur within the Northwest Forest Plan area; Zones 1 through 5.
1:58:22
Zone 1 is the Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan De Fuca, Zone 2
1:58:25
is the outer coast of Washington.
1:58:27
And then Zone 3 is Oregon.
1:58:32
Zone 4 is southern Oregon and northern California.
1:58:34
Zone 5 is down in the San Francisco Bay.
1:58:38
Each of those was meant to be an area of inference where we would design the
1:58:43
scheme to provide an estimate of the trend of the birds in each of those zones.
1:58:48
Then you could add them all together and look at the overall trend within
1:58:50
the Northwest Forest Plan area.
1:58:53
We started out monitoring each of those zones every year.
1:58:57
That went on from the implementation of our monitoring efforts in
1:59:00
2000, so it took like five years to get it designed and under way.
1:59:05
Starting in 2000, we were monitoring every year, but in 2012, the
1:59:09
manager said, “Something’s got to give, this is all too expensive.
1:59:13
What can you do to make it cheaper?” And we said, “Well, if you really had to, you
1:59:19
could revert to sampling very other year, and just have a little bit coarser scale
1:59:27
of inference on these population trends.”
1:59:31
They did implement that. So, now we’re doing every other
1:59:34
year instead of every year.
1:59:36
In the owl case, they have always been after the owl people to drop
1:59:41
some of the big demographic areas, and they’ve resisted, resisted, and still
1:59:47
resisted, but yet they still come.
1:59:49
So, they’re still doing it every year?
1:59:52
They still do it every year on every one of the areas, yeah.
1:59:55
But it’s the most expensive of the monitoring schemes;
1:59:58
really, really expensive.
1:59:59
Well, I think it’s obvious, the reasons why.
2:00:02
I mean, it’s the symbolic animal, from public perception and legal paradigms.
2:00:10
It’s “the one.” And so, it would make sense.
2:00:15
Yep.
2:00:15
And they’re afraid if they use too coarse of a filter, there will be more
2:00:20
wiggle room, legally and scientifically.
2:00:22
Right?
2:00:23
Yeah.
2:00:23
So, there was a time a little while back where they were saying maybe
2:00:27
there was a cheaper way to monitor.
2:00:27
Let’s go do the monitoring, but maybe
2:00:30
in a different way.
2:00:31
Instead of doing these mark, recapture, actual banding efforts, we could do
2:00:37
something based on what’s called occupancy modeling, where you just go out and see
2:00:40
if the bird is there or not, and then track the proportion of the areas you
2:00:45
sample, whether the bird's there, and see if that proportion changes over time.
2:00:49
So I designed, along with our group, a test of an alternative monitoring scheme.
2:00:56
We did this work
2:00:59
in 2010 or ’11.
2:01:03
We laid out
2:01:06
a grid and did random sampling within that grid to detect birds or not detect them.
2:01:14
Did this as a pilot study, but then we computed the costs of doing that work
2:01:18
with the idea that it would be cheaper.
2:01:19
Well, it turned out that it wasn’t cheaper.
2:01:22
It was almost as expensive to do that work as the existing plan, and so we thought
2:01:27
maybe there was a cheaper way, but it turned out there wasn’t a cheaper way.
2:01:30
So, they’re going with the status quo for now, but we’ll see.
2:01:34
It’s a constant pressure to reduce the cost because they claim they can’t
2:01:39
afford it, which I’m sure is true.
2:01:42
So,
2:01:45
obviously, it’s a much different bird than the spotted owl, definitely, greater,
2:01:51
harder to capture, range, whatever.
2:01:54
Did you ever get to know a bird, or a pair?
2:01:57
Like for instance, Eric had “Fat Broad.” [Injured female spotted owl Eric Forsman
2:02:01
rescued, kept as family pet for decades.]
2:02:01
Yeah.
2:02:01
Did you ever have a name for one that you got to know, so to speak?
2:02:05
No.
2:02:06
But I have been able to catch them and handle them, so that’s as close as I came.
2:02:09
We never see these birds again.
2:02:11
So, it’s just once.
2:02:12
You only have the telemetry to know where they go?
2:02:16
So, we’ve caught the birds one time, and then we follow them by flying in
2:02:21
an aircraft and picking up their signal from the beeps on the transmitter.
2:02:25
Have you ever set up some remote camera systems?
2:02:29
We have.
2:02:29
You have?
2:02:30
For instance, like they’ve done with the owl?
2:02:32
Yeah.
2:02:32
We have video footage of a nest and the adults flying in and leaving
2:02:38
a fish for the chick, the chick gobbling it down, really cool.
2:02:43
So, when we did this telemetry study, we got some nests, we put
2:02:47
video cameras on trees, and Tom Bloxton [Raphael’s assistant at time]
2:02:49
went to where the nest tree was.
2:02:50
And were they motion-sensor activated?
2:02:51
No, they were just constantly on at certain times.
2:02:53
Okay.
2:02:54
We ran it on a cycle.
2:02:55
We’d shut it off during the day, but run it at night.
2:02:58
When they were active flying, right?
2:03:01
So, we’ve got a lot of video of birds flying into nests, really neat stuff.
2:03:05
That is pretty cool.
2:03:06
Yeah, I mean, it is really cool.
2:03:07
So, tell me about the
2:03:12
tracking.
2:03:12
We talked about 1999, now we’re coming up on twenty years, at
2:03:17
least from the forest plan, and the monitoring, maybe fifteen years?
2:03:19
Right?
2:03:20
Yeah.
2:03:20
Okay,
2:03:23
tell me about the amount and distribution of marbled murrelet nesting habitat,
2:03:27
the change in overall abundance and reproductive rates of the murrelet,
2:03:31
and predictive relations between the murrelet and nesting habitat
2:03:35
conditions in the forest plan area.
2:03:37
So, you can kind of have a real scientific assessment of trends, futures, etc.?
2:03:46
So, we’ve been doing these surveys, every year since the year 2000.
2:03:51
We have a pretty good picture now of how the population bounces
2:03:54
up and down from our estimates, bouncing around from year to year.
2:04:00
And they are highly variable.
2:04:04
We published a paper showing a really strong negative decline,
2:04:07
from the year 2000 to 2010.
2:04:09
Then we made the mistake of continuing to work, and the next two years,
2:04:12
the population was a bunch higher.
2:04:14
The trend that we saw completely disappeared.
2:04:17
So, anyway, at this point now up through year 2015, the data showed that in
2:04:23
Washington State, numbers of birds were declining over time, especially within
2:04:29
the Puget Sound part of the range, less so in the outer coast part of the range.
2:04:34
Would that be considered from increased anthropogenic change and impacts
2:04:39
of demography and human activity?
2:04:42
Well, it could be.
2:04:43
We’ve done a lot of work to try to understand what’s driving this,
2:04:46
and my opinion is, it’s habitat change actually, loss of habitat.
2:04:52
But this is habitat on non-federal lands, correct?
2:04:55
It’s on both, but it’s primarily non-federal.
2:04:58
The rate of loss on federal lands has been about two percent
2:05:01
over a twenty-year period.
2:05:03
It’s been about twenty percent on the non-federal.
2:05:07
So, ten times higher rate of loss.
2:05:09
And on the non-federal lands, the loss is because of continued logging.
2:05:12
On the federal lands, it’s where fire and natural disturbance happens.
2:05:16
It’s all protected from logging essentially, but you still have wind
2:05:20
throw that comes in and knocks over the potential nesting habitat, and then fire.
2:05:25
Not so much up north here, but down south, like the Biscuit Fire [SW Oregon]
2:05:29
, which was in prime murrelet range that took out a big chunk of habitat.
2:05:32
That must have killed a lot of birds?
2:05:35
Don’t know about killing the birds.
2:05:37
I didn’t mean, wrong question.
2:05:39
That must have destroyed a gigantic amount of habitat?
2:05:41
A big chunk of habitat.
2:05:42
And you can see a signal in their habitat trend, it just takes a little
2:05:47
jog down in the Oregon part of the range, because of that one fire.
2:05:52
When you look at the rates of loss up and down the coast, back on the
2:05:56
population story, the population seemed to be more or less stable.
2:06:00
There’s a lot of fluctuation, but they’re more or less stable.
2:06:03
There’s no trend we can pick up in Oregon and California.
2:06:07
In Washington, there’s a downward trend at a rate of about 4.5 percent per year.
2:06:13
If you look at total acres of habitat lost, it’s the greatest
2:06:17
in Washington, intermediate in Oregon, and lowest in California.
2:06:24
If you look at amount of habitat in relation to the numbers of birds, there’s
2:06:29
a really strong relationship, so that you can plot a curve that shows numbers
2:06:35
of birds and acres of habitat and come up with almost like a straight line.
2:06:40
The more habitat there is inland, the more birds you see off-shore.
2:06:45
But within those areas off-shore where the birds are abundant, their actual
2:06:49
day-to-day distribution is totally dependent on where the forage fish are.
2:06:54
So, they’re using fine features of marine environment to move
2:06:58
around within a narrow range.
2:07:00
But the concentrations of birds are where they’re within commuting
2:07:04
range of the habitat that they use.
2:07:06
So, it’s a real interesting relationship.
2:07:09
Regarding changes in
2:07:12
fish populations, we’ve had population crashes and problems with salmon and
2:07:17
other species, and fishing moratoriums are finally being lifted along the coast.
2:07:24
I mean, they’re not taking the big fish, but the whole ecosystem is
2:07:27
affected, the population and food chain.
2:07:31
How has that affected the murrelet, their food sources, and ability to
2:07:37
increase or decrease their populations?
2:07:39
The short answer is, I wish I knew.
2:07:42
It’s because we don’t have good data on the fish these birds are using.
2:07:46
We have inferences we can draw from environmental conditions that probably
2:07:52
affect forage fish populations.
2:07:54
It’s things like sea surface temperature, what’s called upwelling,
2:07:58
where offshore winds blowing across the surface of the ocean bring up
2:08:02
cold water from down deep, and that’s nutrient-rich and provides for the food
2:08:07
chain that leads to the forage fish.
2:08:09
And we’ve looked at upwelling patterns in relation to where the birds are.
2:08:14
None of those things are good predictors of numbers and trends of murrelets.
2:08:19
The thing that’s a good predictor is the amount of nesting habitat and its trends.
2:08:24
But there’s definitely something there, because they are foraging
2:08:28
out in the marine environment.
2:08:30
We have one little piece of data from one part of the range off of the
2:08:36
Willapa Bay Area, which is in southern Washington, where we actually do
2:08:39
have really good fish data over time.
2:08:41
And it’s very intriguing that we see the same pattern in fish of downward
2:08:46
trends, from 2000 to 2015, and the shape of that downward trend is the
2:08:51
same shape we see in the murrelet trend.
2:08:54
It’s very suggestive then, that changes of fish could be helping to drive
2:08:59
the changes in murrelet populations.
2:09:01
But that’s the only place we have the right kind of data.
2:09:03
The bigger fish, the ones they don’t feed on, but they’re an indicator of
2:09:06
an ecosystem shift or change or shock?
2:09:10
It could be because I’ve also done work where I’ve looked at numbers of
2:09:13
murrelets in relation to number of salmon returning to the Bonneville
2:09:17
Dam where they do a total count of fish every year, and there’s a really
2:09:21
strong correlation between murrelet abundance and Chinook salmon abundance.
2:09:26
Chinook salmon move up and down the same part of the coast where the birds forage
2:09:31
and are feeding on a lot of same fish, so there’s reason to think they could be
2:09:35
responding to some of the same patterns.
2:09:37
They reflect or mirror the other.
2:09:39
Not necessarily a cause-and-effect in terms of how they affect directly the
2:09:45
ecosystem dynamics, but they’re mirroring each other in terms of how they see their
2:09:50
own survival and food resources, right?
2:09:51
Yeah, right, so that’s very intriguing.
2:09:53
But another intriguing thing is, if you look at spotted owl trends, the population
2:09:59
and decline in spotted owls are steep in Washington and less steep in Oregon
2:10:03
and California, just like murrelets.
2:10:05
But the spotted owls have nothing to do with fish.
2:10:08
They’re responding only to forest conditions.
2:10:11
Or now, to barred owls.
2:10:13
Well, yeah.
2:10:15
And is there some reason why we see that same pattern?
2:10:18
And now that you mention barred owls, there’s a longer history
2:10:23
of barred owl occurrence in the northern part of the range than
2:10:26
in the southern part of the range.
2:10:28
So, that could be part of it, but there could be some underlying changes
2:10:31
in the forest environment that are also contributing to the faster
2:10:36
rate of decline up north than south.
2:10:38
So, that’s kind of intriguing.
2:10:41
What has surprised you most about what you thought, your theorems, your
2:10:48
assumptions, your premises, going into the monitoring period, because really,
2:10:53
that’s when you learned was after this went into effect, I mean, really learned.
2:11:00
What was the most surprising thing or something that confirmed what you
2:11:03
thought you were maybe going to find?
2:11:08
Well, this whole relationship about numbers of birds and amounts of nesting
2:11:11
habitat, was the biggest shocker to me.
2:11:14
I first found out when we did the radar studies, because we put these radars into
2:11:19
drainages and it turned out when we really looked at the data, that the count of
2:11:24
numbers of birds flying up into these big river drainages was totally correlated
2:11:29
with the amount of habitat that you could count up within that same drainage.
2:11:33
I thought, whoa!
2:11:35
Because here’s this bird that spends all its time on the water foraging,
2:11:38
and I thought it was the marine environment that was going to be the
2:11:40
main driver, and that the forest was going to be sort of a secondary thing.
2:11:47
But every time we looked at the relationship, it’s the terrestrial
2:11:50
nesting habitat that keeps popping up as the best predictor.
2:11:54
So, you’ve never found for like a big correlation between El Niño dynamics or
2:12:00
-- ? Nope.
2:12:01
In upwelling?
2:12:02
I mean, there’s some patterns there.
2:12:05
Another really interesting thing we found was, the
2:12:13
San Juan Islands, this whole group of islands up there.
2:12:14
[Between Washington state and Vancouver Island, B.C]
2:12:14
The San Juans, correct.
2:12:14
Yeah, we’ve done a lot of surveys around the San Juan Islands,
2:12:18
and then in the outer coast.
2:12:21
It turns out the San Juan
2:12:25
Islands can be viewed as a safety net for these birds.
2:12:29
When things like upwelling doesn’t occur the way it’s supposed to and forage
2:12:33
conditions are bad on the outer coast, that’s what’s called the California
2:12:37
current system that runs up and down the coast, they can always go to the
2:12:41
San Juans where it’s tidally-driven and the food production is sort of
2:12:45
there, year after year after year.
2:12:46
It may not be as great as it is in the outer coast, but at
2:12:49
least you can count on that.
2:12:50
So, those years where El Niño has been really strong or upwelling has
2:12:55
failed, the birds flood into the San Juans, and we see these huge spikes
2:12:59
in numbers of birds around the San Juans on those particular years.
2:13:02
That has been really interesting and fascinating to
2:13:08
me.
2:13:08
I never would have predicted that the San Juans would be this kind of place.
2:13:09
What’s the populations you see up here, you know, Bellingham
2:13:13
in to the North Cascades area?
2:13:16
Is that much less because you’ve got the Vancouver Island
2:13:20
buffer of this, and this is
2:13:22
-- ? Well, first of all, the birds that occur here are constantly moving
2:13:26
over into the Vancouver Island area.
2:13:27
And so, they’re not U.S. birds, they’re international birds.
2:13:30
They’re Canucks, yes.
2:13:31
And they totally show everything.
2:13:32
So, it doesn’t even show Vancouver Island there, but that’s an important
2:13:35
part of the world for marbled murrelets.
2:13:35
Right.
2:13:37
But numbers of birds in general increase as you go north.
2:13:41
When you get to Alaska, they are ten times more abundant than they are down here
2:13:46
per unit basis, maybe because there’s way better densities of fish up there.
2:13:52
That’s my theory.
2:13:54
What about
2:13:57
up there?
2:13:58
They have their own sets of cutting controversies, the Tongass
2:14:01
[National Forest] , and all that.
2:14:02
What have found up there, relational stuff to habitat, or
2:14:06
has it not been studied enough?
2:14:07
Well, it hasn’t been studied that well.
2:14:09
But the population does seem to be declining up there as well,
2:14:13
and it’s presumably because of the loss of habitat due to logging.
2:14:17
With the Tongass Plan, a lot of logging has ceased, and there’s special
2:14:22
protections for murrelets along what they call the fringe habitat where they nest in
2:14:27
the forest that’s right along the coast.
2:14:29
That’s been largely protected now.
2:14:30
So, what they haven’t done is the kind of work we’ve done to
2:14:38
track habitat change over time.
2:14:39
We’ve got estimates that show how a habitat has changed year-by-year-by-year
2:14:43
from the start of the forest plan [NWFP] . They don’t have that up north.
2:14:47
They just have survey data of murrelets, and we can see that there
2:14:51
has been a decline, but we don’t have really good data on changing
2:14:55
forest habitat up there over time.
2:14:58
So, we can surmise that a lot of that change is because of
2:15:01
the effects of past logging.
2:15:04
But it could be a foraging fish situation, too, and I just don’t know at this point.
2:15:12
Like I said, it’s really intriguing that the number of birds per unit of nesting
2:15:17
habitat is ten times higher up there.
2:15:19
So, it means that somehow that same amount of nesting habitat
2:15:23
supports ten times more birds.
2:15:24
Well, is that because they pack in more tightly?
2:15:26
I don’t think so.
2:15:27
I think it’s because there’s better foraging, and that there’s a higher
2:15:30
carrying capacity because of greater numbers of the forage fish up there.
2:15:35
And that’s a question I’m hoping that we can figure out a way to answer.
2:15:38
And it would seem that their theoretical range in terms of the
2:15:41
forest, would definitely have to be closer to the coast because of the
2:15:45
different climatological elements.
2:15:47
Because, when you get up above 1,000-1,500 feet, you’re in the snow zone.
2:15:51
[In Alaska]
2:15:51
Yeah, it’s all ice and snow.
2:15:52
And so they cannot go too high, that’s obviously the reason there.
2:15:55
What’s their temperature range?
2:15:59
What can and cannot they tolerate?
2:16:03
I don’t know an answer to that.
2:16:07
They occur in the Aleutians where it’s, you know, iced over much of the year.
2:16:11
So, that’s likely low, yeah.
2:16:13
So, they manage to survive and over winter in these really cold areas, but I
2:16:18
couldn’t tell you what their tolerance is.
2:16:19
But you’re going to find probably even a slightly different sub-species up there
2:16:22
with different adaptational capabilities?
2:16:24
You would think, but no.
2:16:26
No?
2:16:26
When you do genetic studies and compare Aleutian Island birds to
2:16:30
everywhere else, they’re pretty similar.
2:16:32
Now, it turns out there is a bit of a genetic difference in
2:16:35
Aleutian versus everything else.
2:16:38
There’s a little bit of a genetic signal in the Santa Cruz birds
2:16:41
versus this whole central area.
2:16:43
But everything in southeast Alaska all the way down through San Francisco Bay,
2:16:47
is pretty much genetically what they call pamic, which means indistinguishable.
2:16:52
Okay.
2:16:53
The Aleutian ones do have a little bit of a difference.
2:16:56
But how that translates into behavioral or adaptational
2:17:01
differences, we don’t any clue about.
2:17:03
We just know that there’s a little bit of a difference in genetic patterns.
2:17:09
Okay.
2:17:10
Now, how has and will climate change affect the marbled murrelet’s habitat
2:17:16
range and populations, in your view?
2:17:18
Have you seen it already and what do you figure in the future might happen?
2:17:22
Well, it’s really hard to predict.
2:17:23
But the main thing that’s likely to happen is changing of these patterns of
2:17:27
upwelling, and we know that upwelling has a huge effect on the entire food chain.
2:17:32
Upwelling is driven by winds.
2:17:35
The winds are driven by the low-pressure systems that
2:17:39
develop on the western Pacific.
2:17:43
Climate change is going to likely affect the development and persistence of these
2:17:49
low-pressure systems, which will ripple all the way through the food chain.
2:17:52
But exactly how that’s going to be expressed, is really hard to predict.
2:17:58
You see some climatologists give one direction with a lower expression of
2:18:05
these low-pressure systems, and others say no, it will cause a higher expression.
2:18:10
And the same with the resulting cascading things like El Niños, La Niña.
2:18:16
They really can’t pick which way that’s going to go.
2:18:17
But something is going to change as a result of climate change,
2:18:20
we just don’t know exactly how.
2:18:22
But it definitely will cascade itself to the murrelets because
2:18:25
of the effects on the food chain.
2:18:28
In terms of nesting habitat, a little bit less certain about that.
2:18:33
It turns out, well, most projections I’ve seen about forest change in
2:18:39
relation to change in climate, are pretty minimal for the coastal belt
2:18:44
where the murrelets occur because it’s buffered by this marine environment.
2:18:50
We don’t expect to see big changes in the type of forest cover the
2:18:54
murrelets use over the foreseeable climate change future scenarios.
2:18:59
So, nesting habitat shouldn’t be affected that much, but foraging habitat
2:19:03
potentially dramatically affected and with confident changes in the birds.
2:19:07
Schmieding: This is not on my list, but it just came to mind; have you ever
2:19:15
considered the legacy of an event that happened many years ago that
2:19:19
dramatically affected coastal stands of big trees, the Columbus Day wind storm
2:19:24
of 1962 [Typhoon Freda, degraded Cat.
2:19:24
3 storm, intersected with storm to north, created most powerful wind
2:19:27
storm in NW history – 120-180 mph.]
2:19:27
Yeah.
2:19:27
I mean, have you ever figured that into your model, or just
2:19:32
how does that figure into it?
2:19:34
I mean, it was such a massive thing on the coast.
2:19:36
Well, it figures in an indirect way, because the forest that we see now
2:19:41
that we measured in all the monitoring, is a result of those past episodes.
2:19:46
A lot of it in this area has what would be called a high-severity,
2:19:50
low-frequency fire regime.
2:19:52
So, when a fire does occur here, it’s a big one.
2:19:55
But it’s a very low frequency thing, so like every, the fire return
2:19:59
interval is maybe 200-250 years.
2:20:02
So, these big fires have,
2:20:06
you know, there’s ancient fires that you can find signals of
2:20:09
those on the Olympic Peninsula.
2:20:10
But there haven’t been any really big ones in recent years as the forest that we see
2:20:15
now has all recovered from many of those large high-severity [disturbance events]
2:20:19
. And the same for the wind storm I was talking about, too, right?
2:20:22
Yeah, right.
2:20:22
Yeah.
2:20:22
So, there’s going to be some bit of a signature of the change of the forest
2:20:27
from those early events, but it’s sort of recovered from those now.
2:20:31
But
2:20:34
we have seen a signal of the more recent wind events that happened, I think
2:20:39
it was like 2008 there was a big one that occurred along the western coast.
2:20:42
Seven.
2:20:43
2007.
2:20:44
I know because I was moving up from Arizona, and I had to delay my departure
2:20:49
because I had a high-profile truck.
2:20:51
I thought that I should wait a day or two because I might be
2:20:55
vulnerable—and this is inland, too.
2:20:57
Well, we can see that.
2:20:58
When we look at the year-to-year change in forest cover for the off-coast
2:21:02
of Washington, we look at our little graphs and you’ll see a blip that year.
2:21:06
It happened that while we were doing the monitoring there was a blip downward in
2:21:11
murrelet populations shortly thereafter.
2:21:13
I thought, “Whoa, that’s amazing.
2:21:14
It really signals, there’s a real response to that change in wind pattern.”
2:21:20
Right.
2:21:20
But as it happened, the population came up the next two years after that.
2:21:24
So, that little effect disappeared.
2:21:26
That was just coincidence it turned out.
2:21:29
But, yeah, there are a lot of these events that are definitely
2:21:32
going to have an effect.
2:21:32
I would venture a guess the biggest impact, and nobody was studying this
2:21:36
back then, from the Columbus Day wind storm, was the fact that all the salvage
2:21:42
logging that followed, and all the roads that were built to enable that
2:21:47
to happen, are still there, or maybe some of them have been closed by now.
2:21:52
But that’s to me, a legacy.
2:21:54
That is a legacy.
2:21:56
And roads create edges, edges create opportunities for some of these corvids,
2:22:00
so there could be a continuing effect of depressed numbers of successful
2:22:04
nests because of ongoing effects of these increased corvid numbers.
2:22:10
Corvid numbers have increased dramatically on the West Coast over time, in
2:22:14
general, and that’s one contributor.
2:22:17
Increased human habitation is another contributor.
2:22:20
There are a lot of reasons for that, but those things can have a rippling effect.
2:22:25
We often talk about the ghost of past timber harvest as something
2:22:29
that we continue to see today.
2:22:31
The harvest isn’t continuing now at the same rate it used to,
2:22:34
but the landscape has completely changed because of all the harvest.
2:22:38
I mean, we still see it on satellites all this area of clear-cut
2:22:43
logging that occurred in the ‘90s.
2:22:44
It’s going to take decades for them to recover.
2:22:48
That’s a lingering consequence that we see in the murrelet numbers.
2:22:52
It’s one of the reasons the murrelet was listed in the first place was
2:22:55
because of what was presumed to be a tremendous loss of murrelet numbers
2:22:59
as a result of all that past work.
2:23:01
Especially in the Siuslaw, correct?
2:23:02
Oh, yeah.
2:23:03
I mean, that was—
2:23:04
In the Olympic Peninsula, too.
2:23:06
We used to have a picture of that satellite image around here.
2:23:12
Do you want me to go—here, I’ll hold it for a second.
2:23:13
Again, I didn’t have it.
2:23:14
[Looking at image/map on table]
2:23:15
I was saying this satellite image is very dramatic.
2:23:18
You can clearly see the relatively undisturbed part of the Olympic
2:23:23
Peninsula that’s continued within the Olympic National Park where the
2:23:27
national forest lands surrounding it are kind of a salt-and-pepper
2:23:32
appearance on the satellite from all the clear-cuts that are on those lands.
2:23:35
And then, of course, the private lands outside of the national forest which is
2:23:39
heavily cut over, especially on the West Coast where the Quinault Indian lands are.
2:23:45
They’ve pretty much clear-cut all of those in decades past.
2:23:50
So, yeah, it shows right up on the satellite
2:23:54
image.
2:23:54
Now,
2:23:58
comparing the pre-Northwest Forest Plans and practices versus post,
2:24:06
how would you characterize the sustainability of either paradigm in
2:24:11
the different ways that you have to compare, ecologically and economically?
2:24:15
How would you describe that dynamic?
2:24:18
Well, a huge difference, obviously, between ecological and economic.
2:24:26
Economically, the rate of harvest in those pre-‘90s areas wasn’t going to be
2:24:33
sustainable over the long run because they were going to run out anyway.
2:24:37
They’d already cut, some estimates say, up to ninety percent of
2:24:42
the old forest up to that point, with only ten percent remaining.
2:24:45
That’s variable, of course, from different parts of the range.
2:24:48
But obviously, that pattern wasn’t going to be sustainable over the long run, and
2:24:52
those communities were going to be going through these kinds of wrenching changes
2:24:56
anyway, it was just a matter of when.
2:24:58
Your typical world history, over-extraction, primary product
2:25:03
economies, always in boom-and-bust cycles.
2:25:06
Yeah.
2:25:06
And it’s not just privy to the United States and forestry in
2:25:10
the Northwest, but yes, correct.
2:25:12
On the economic side, yes, unsustainable practices.
2:25:17
And now, the rate of harvest, it’s a really low rate, but it’s obviously
2:25:25
going to be sustainable over time.
2:25:27
That’s a rate that can, there’s plenty of opportunity for replenishment of
2:25:32
those lands to replace those that are being harvested at the rate they are now.
2:25:38
Ecologically, of course, it’s a completely different universe these days.
2:25:42
We have set in motion
2:25:47
long-term growth and increase in the amount of these late
2:25:51
successional old-growth forests.
2:25:52
They’re going to be increasing for the next 100-plus years.
2:25:56
We won’t actually see the Northwest Forest Plan reach its potential for that
2:26:04
many years, because right now, we’re still recovering from the clear-cuts
2:26:07
of the ‘90s, and they’re only, what, thirty years old, twenty years old?
2:26:10
So, it’s going to take forests 100 to 250 years to attain the
2:26:16
stature of these old forests.
2:26:17
And so, the forest plan won’t look like what the forest plan looks like on a
2:26:21
map until that many years have passed.
2:26:23
Putting a line on a map doesn’t change the ecology of the system.
2:26:26
It just sets in motion a different set of trajectories for the land.
2:26:32
Now, what do you say about criticisms
2:26:38
that say the plan did not respect the rights of traditional communities
2:26:46
that relied on timber harvest?
2:26:48
And even though that may not have been the intention, that is how it played
2:26:52
out, and that didn’t include just management and planning, but also lawsuits
2:26:58
and the whole dynamic, even within Matrix and Adaptive Management Areas.
2:27:05
Well, as I said before, when we looked at those different components, ecosystems,
2:27:11
ecological, economic and social, we were attempting to provide some measure on each
2:27:19
of those dimensions, but the ecological had sort of become the primary one.
2:27:23
So, after you meet the ecological goals, then meet the economic and social goals.
2:27:29
That only allowed for a small fraction of what these communities
2:27:32
had been enjoying up until that point.
2:27:37
But there was a huge attempt to at least be cognizant of that and provide
2:27:42
every opportunity possible for those economic and social influences.
2:27:47
And there was a whole other component that a guy named Jim Pipkin [assistant
2:27:51
to Sec. of Interior Bruce Babbitt] had put together which was, I forget the
2:27:54
acronym for it now, but the whole sort of community support system that provided
2:28:00
for payments to timber communities in lieu of receipts from logging.
2:28:06
So, there was an economic subsidy that was put in place.
2:28:10
There’s that, and that was helping.
2:28:16
The
2:28:19
job market changed dramatically, obviously, from timber jobs to other
2:28:24
jobs associated with the environment.
2:28:26
So, that was a big shift from logging to
2:28:33
other sorts of jobs, and that was a big part of the monitoring plan that
2:28:38
evaluated those changes as well.
2:28:41
So, some of those communities have had a tough time of it.
2:28:46
You know, a classic case being Forks [Washington] , which was
2:28:48
almost totally timber dependent, and now has had to provide twilight
2:28:51
tour opportunities or something.
2:28:52
But yeah, I don’t know
2:28:55
what to
2:28:59
say about that.
2:29:00
It’s not going to be the same as it was for any of those communities.
2:29:05
No.
2:29:06
Do you think though, if “Survey and Manage” had not been there, and
2:29:11
like it [NWFP] was implemented like it was originally designed, do you
2:29:15
think that it might have been better?
2:29:17
A little bit.
2:29:18
But, it wasn’t a huge impact.
2:29:20
Because the big impact was the reserve system.
2:29:23
I mean, that took out eighty-five percent of those lands and put
2:29:25
them into a reserve status.
2:29:28
Survey and Manage only applied in that intervening Matrix, which
2:29:32
was at most fifteen percent.
2:29:34
So, it’s a relatively small piece of the picture, but it was one factor that led
2:29:39
to not being able to meet the original “Probable Sale Quantity” [in NWFP]
2:29:44
. What’s forgotten though is that probable didn’t mean guaranteed, it meant probable.
2:29:48
And it was subject to all the various things that would have
2:29:50
to be done that would result in actual sales being performed.
2:29:56
But there’s no doubt that it was less than originally anticipated, and
2:30:00
“Survey and Manage” was one contributor to it being less than anticipated.
2:30:05
Another was that all these layers of protection meant that the Adaptive
2:30:10
Management Areas that had been envisioned, were never able to really
2:30:13
able to get off the ground because there were just too many constraints.
2:30:16
Every time you tried to set up a big experiment, you still had
2:30:20
the ESA and Endangered Species Act, requirements to maintain.
2:30:23
You had anadromous fish, conservation strategies to meet, and all these
2:30:28
different constraints and you just couldn’t do the things that were
2:30:34
originally envisioned in providing all this flexibility and ways to experiment.
2:30:37
It just didn’t happen.
2:30:39
What
2:30:42
major AMA’s that didn’t work out were in the murrelet range?
2:30:47
Probably in the Siuslaw, would be my obvious thought about that.
2:30:51
Yeah, or Cispus [near Mount St. Helens in Washington] , and there
2:30:52
was one on the Olympic, too.
2:30:54
I don’t actually know.
2:30:55
I didn’t look at it.
2:30:55
Okay.
2:30:57
I never got involved with those AMA’s per se, so I wasn’t involved
2:31:06
with that.
2:31:07
Let’s talk about the twenty-year review.
2:31:09
Encapsulize the twenty-year review that’s, well, it’s coming
2:31:13
out or it’s been, it’s out.
2:31:15
I think they’re all out.
2:31:16
Maybe the riparian one hasn’t quite been published yet, but it’s done.
2:31:19
Now, tell me about the twenty-year review regarding your two areas of
2:31:23
expertise, the endangered species, the birds, the murrelet and the
2:31:26
owl, and you can speak for Eric.
2:31:28
He’s going to be interviewed in three weeks, but you can
2:31:30
at least give your take.
2:31:34
Well, the owl populations are faring more badly than we anticipated.
2:31:42
We thought that in twenty years we’d start to see an uptick in the amount
2:31:47
of habitat, and there would be a stabilization of owl populations.
2:31:52
But we really thought that it’s going to be take three to five decades before
2:31:57
that amount of habitat started to really start showing a net increase, and that
2:32:03
still seems it’s going to be the case.
2:32:06
However, in twenty years, the stabilization or what the reduction
2:32:13
in the loss of habitat is, everybody is now aware, it hasn’t resulted in
2:32:18
a stabilization of owl populations.
2:32:21
The decline is getting worse.
2:32:23
In the case of the owls, it’s now
2:32:27
declined throughout the entire range, whereas before, it was just in the
2:32:31
Washington part of the range, and
2:32:34
pretty weak evidence of decline elsewhere.
2:32:36
Now, there is pretty strong evidence of decline elsewhere, with the
2:32:40
strongest decline in the Washington part, especially up in the Cascades,
2:32:45
like the Cle Elum area, where the birds are almost completely gone.
2:32:49
So, the protection of habitat hasn’t arrested the decline in spotted owls, and
2:32:54
the biggest culprit right now does seem to be the interaction with the barred
2:32:57
owl, and hence, these big experiments now to do direct intervention and kill
2:33:03
the barred owls and see how the spotted owls respond to the removal of the barred
2:33:06
owls, which does seem to be having an immediate positive impact on spotted owls.
2:33:12
What do you have to say about the ethics of that?
2:33:14
I’m conflicted about it.
2:33:16
I don’t like it.
2:33:19
In a lot of ways, it’s [species competition] a natural phenomenon.
2:33:21
I mean, there is the argument that human activity has exacerbated the
2:33:25
rate of movement of the barred owls across the landscape from east to west.
2:33:29
And I can’t refute that.
2:33:32
It’s quite possible humans have had something to do with providing
2:33:37
opportunities for that to happen.
2:33:39
But to a large extent, it’s sort of a natural range expansion facilitated
2:33:45
perhaps by climate change and changing forest cover over time.
2:33:50
But here you have two birds that both in the biology of things
2:33:55
have a right to exist, and we just happened to put an endangered species
2:34:06
emphasis on the spotted owl, and the barred owl isn’t endangered.
2:34:10
So,
2:34:13
it’s the one that has to go.
2:34:14
But humans have a long history of doing that.
2:34:16
We constantly are removing birds, too, that depredate agricultural crops.
2:34:21
We’ve killed starlings by the millions.
2:34:24
We kill all kinds of birds that are interfering with our economic development.
2:34:29
We tend to do that.
2:34:30
We extinguished the passenger pigeon.
2:34:32
Yeah.
2:34:33
That’s a real extreme.
2:34:35
Yeah.
2:34:36
So, I sort of view it as a natural ecological process.
2:34:43
I actually think that eventually those two species will co-exist, but they
2:34:48
— Do they ever cross-breed?
2:34:50
Yes, they do.
2:34:51
Okay.
2:34:51
It’s not a huge factor, but they do.
2:34:54
And they call them sparred owls, spotted-barred owl hybrids.
2:34:58
And there are even instances known of viable offspring from those hybrid pairs.
2:35:06
And those offspring have in turn bred and produced offspring.
2:35:09
So, it’s an effect, but Eric and others tell me that it’s not been a huge effect,
2:35:15
that it has a measurable thing but changes in habitat and changes in just barred
2:35:22
owl displacement are the real effects.
2:35:24
Hybridization is fairly small.
2:35:29
For the murrelets—
2:35:32
Is there an analogous competitor or dynamic that’s in play at all?
2:35:38
For murrelets?
2:35:38
Yeah, I mean, this expansion and the increasing number of these corridors.
2:35:42
Right, that’s what I said.
2:35:43
It would be sort of analogous, driven in part because of human activity and
2:35:49
increased introgression of people out into these previously undisturbed landscapes.
2:35:57
That may be one of the big drivers of long-term population
2:36:00
change on into the future.
2:36:02
That we will have to see.
2:36:04
We think that, and we have this working hypothesis that says, because we’ve
2:36:08
seen this strong relationship between amount of habitat and numbers of
2:36:11
birds, that when we start seeing a net increase in habitat rather than a net
2:36:16
loss, as we’ve seen up until now, when that time comes, we’re expecting to see
2:36:21
an increase in murrelet populations.
2:36:25
If it turns out we don’t see that increase when habitat increases, then
2:36:28
that’s going to change our understanding a lot, and it may turn out that then
2:36:32
we need to really focus on the marine environment because that may turn out
2:36:36
to be what’s holding populations back.
2:36:38
But right now, our hypothesis is that we have yet to see the
2:36:44
benefits of the forest plan because habitat is still on the decline.
2:36:47
But when it starts increasing, then it will be different.
2:36:54
Describe some of the relationships and personalities of people that you’ve known
2:36:59
and worked with during this whole thing.
2:37:01
I mean, obviously, Eric Forsman is somebody that comes to mind, but
2:37:04
also members of the Gang of Four.
2:37:06
Just any other memories or reflections on the people you’ve known, the
2:37:11
experiences you’ve had, the mentors you’ve had, the friends you’ve had.
2:37:15
I just want more of a capstone kind of answer.
2:37:20
Well, I’ve had the privilege of working with a whole lot of
2:37:22
people during this whole process.
2:37:24
One guy that I worked with the most intimately was Richard Holthausen,
2:37:29
if you run across his name.
2:37:32
He was a co-leader of the terrestrial group in this FEMAT
2:37:37
exercise, along with Chuck Meslow.
2:37:39
But “Holt,” I really liked him, and he was just such a good writer, such
2:37:46
an articulate guy. Whenever we did this work, he was always the guy that
2:37:50
came up with these really good ways of expressing what our results were, and
2:37:56
how to ask good questions. He retired and moved away, so I haven’t had a chance
2:38:01
to work with him in many, many years.
2:38:02
But
2:38:05
that was one of the most influential characters that I
2:38:09
had the chance to work with.
2:38:13
Eric was always the guy I admired as being the natural historian.
2:38:18
He just knows so much about the biology of these animals, and
2:38:22
he loves the animals so much.
2:38:24
I mean, you get a real sense of a spotted owl is not just this
2:38:29
creature with a lambda of .65 and a survival rate of .3, but it was the
2:38:35
bird that, you know, flies down and ate a mouse right out of his hand.
2:38:39
And weighed, whatever it weighed.
2:38:43
And he’s just a cool guy to be out in the woods with, and see everything
2:38:46
he knows about plants and animals.
2:38:50
The other character I worked with over the years is Bruce
2:38:55
Marcot.
2:38:55
He’s also a part of this whole effort.
2:38:57
I’ve known him for a really long time, and he’s actually a part of
2:39:00
the team I supervised for a time.
2:39:03
And he’s one of these genius guys, a true Renaissance man, who sort of
2:39:09
knows something about everything.
2:39:10
He’s not only a really good sort of theoretician, but he’s like Eric in
2:39:16
being this natural history savant.
2:39:18
He knows plants, he knows animals, and he knows fungi,
2:39:22
you name it, he knows about it.
2:39:24
And what’s really intriguing about him, is he also has this website
2:39:28
that is the most complex, convoluted thing you could ever imagine.
2:39:32
It’s just a multi-faceted deal where he’ll have poetry that
2:39:35
he wrote on one wing of it.
2:39:37
He’ll have word games he plays on another, where he does mnemonics
2:39:44
and switches words around.
2:39:46
What’s the expression when you have one word and then you rearrange
2:39:49
the letters for another word?
2:39:51
Anagrams.
2:39:51
So, he does amazing anagrams and writes whole stories with anagrams.
2:39:56
Then he has musings and philosophy.
2:39:58
Then he has photography.
2:39:59
He’s an excellent photographer.
2:40:01
Then he has astrophysics and speculates about astronomy
2:40:05
and physics and the universe.
2:40:08
An amazing guy.
2:40:09
So, I’ve worked with him on all this stuff.
2:40:13
But
2:40:15
it’s amazing how that in the social dynamics, you have a guy like Bruce
2:40:21
who has all those amazing capabilities, but in working with people, he’s
2:40:25
completely polar opposite of someone like Holthausen, who just communicates so
2:40:29
effectively with everybody he works with.
2:40:33
And then, of course, having had really the honor to work with Jack Thomas closely
2:40:37
for all those years though, was amazing.
2:40:40
Tell me about him a little bit more.
2:40:43
I never met him, unfortunately.
2:40:44
Well, he’s a totally bigger and larger-than-life character,
2:40:48
if there ever was one.
2:40:52
I had the chance to travel to India with him on a couple of occasions.
2:40:55
So, I was around him for days and days on end.
2:40:57
And what was really hilarious about him, is he loved to tell stories about himself.
2:41:02
He was always the star of these stories.
2:41:03
And he would just, every time we’d run into a new group of people, he would start
2:41:09
his series of stories that featured him.
2:41:13
He would be going, and it’s almost like we would have words for his stories,
2:41:18
like one of them was, “fine figure of a man.” Well, here comes a “fine figure of
2:41:21
a man,” we’d all snicker to ourselves.
2:41:23
But he had this story where, I don’t know, I can’t even remember the story nowadays,
2:41:28
but the kind of the punch line, “Well, he was a fine figure of a man.” And it was
2:41:31
Jack walking down this trail. You know, this huge guy, and he was the fine figure
2:41:36
of a man. But he would tell that story every time we’d run into a new group.
2:41:40
It was just hilarious.
2:41:42
But he had a charismatic character.
2:41:47
People would just love to sort of flock around and listen to him talk.
2:41:50
And
2:41:53
he talked about everything.
2:41:55
He did this one lecture about being a professional, being a professional
2:41:59
wildlife biologist, and presenting yourself like a professional.
2:42:03
So, here I am in jeans.
2:42:05
He would hate that.
2:42:05
He thought when you were at a meeting, you needed to dress
2:42:08
appropriately, and when you gave a talk, wear a tie and wear a jacket.
2:42:13
Look like a professional and be professional.
2:42:15
And it had a huge influence on me because I was sort of this raggedy-ass
2:42:19
field guy, and I got to know him and realized, hey, this is unprofessional.
2:42:23
We are excellent professionals here, and I sort of spiffed up my act a little
2:42:28
bit when I was subject to his influence.
2:42:31
He would envision things and make them happen, and nobody else
2:42:36
could do it the way he could.
2:42:37
So, like this whole FEMAT thing, we had to buy computers.
2:42:40
Well, in the Forest Service, if you want to buy a computer,
2:42:42
you’re going to go through this technical acquisition process.
2:42:45
You have to justify, you have to do all these hurdles.
2:42:48
It’s almost impossible to buy a new computer, especially a fancy one.
2:42:52
We did this somehow, he produced computers for everybody way
2:42:56
beyond the limits that are normal.
2:42:59
We had to live in
2:43:02
that pink tower area.
2:43:05
[Downtown Portland, Oregon.] You normally can’t just go and stay for three months
2:43:07
at a time in some remote location.
2:43:10
But he found a way to make that happen.
2:43:12
You had to pay all these contracts to get these outside experts in, and
2:43:17
university professors to have them.
2:43:19
He somehow managed to make it happen.
2:43:22
I just thought it was the most amazing thing in the world to see him operate.
2:43:26
And just before he ever started this, he had that Starkey Experimental
2:43:30
Forest, and that involved putting a big fence and maintaining it around
2:43:36
whatever it is, 20,000 acres of forest, and it was a huge undertaking.
2:43:40
It’s in the Blues, correct?
2:43:41
Yeah, in the Blue Mountains.
2:43:43
He built that thing and kept it going.
2:43:44
And then managed to sell it, to not only the Forest Service, but the Congress,
2:43:49
who was funding the Forest Service, and to keep the funding going to this day.
2:43:53
I mean, his influence.
2:43:55
So, he is a character that I definitely will never forget.
2:43:59
Just the greatest.
2:44:01
I mean, a great biologist.
2:44:04
What took him, actually?
2:44:05
What was his health problem?
2:44:06
Pancreatic cancer.
2:44:08
Just like Jim Sedell?
2:44:10
Yeah.
2:44:11
He had kind of
2:44:15
a remission.
2:44:16
Pancreatic cancer is usually really bad, really fast.
2:44:19
Like Jim?
2:44:20
Yeah.
2:44:21
In Jack’s case, he got it, and then, he had sort of a recovery period, and
2:44:26
stabilized, and went for a few years.
2:44:28
Then it hit again and he went pretty fast.
2:44:31
The last time I saw him actually was at a memorial service for Hal Salwasser.
2:44:42
Jack came up and here’s this little skinny person, and Jack’s a big guy.
2:44:48
He was like 250.
2:44:49
250 to 300 at some point.
2:44:52
But maybe around 250.
2:44:53
How tall was he?
2:44:54
Somewhere around six-two or four.
2:44:56
Okay.
2:44:58
Yeah, because Hal was more like six-four, and was a little bit taller than he is.
2:45:03
But yeah, so when I saw him at Hal’s thing, he was just skinny
2:45:07
as could be, and on a cane.
2:45:09
Still really alert, totally the same mentally, but it was shocking to see him.
2:45:17
I just couldn’t believe it.
2:45:19
So, that was maybe six months before he actually died.
2:45:23
I had a chance to go up to the Starkey where they had a memorial service among
2:45:28
his friends and close colleagues, and it was really neat how everybody told
2:45:33
me stories about Jack, and sat around.
2:45:35
He was definitely a well-loved character.
2:45:38
He was really something.
2:45:40
How about Jerry Franklin?
2:45:42
You know, Jerry, I never got to know that well.
2:45:44
Jerry was impressive because of the way he could articulate things,
2:45:48
and had the ear and could express things to Congress, especially.
2:45:52
He was really good at that and they just hung on his every word.
2:45:57
So, he had a huge, he still does have, a huge influence.
2:46:01
He and Norm Johnson both.
2:46:04
They’re just continuing to influence the way things work.
2:46:08
Like the new Oregon Land Management, the BLM’s revised land management
2:46:15
plan [including O & C lands] , a lot of it is driven by the
2:46:17
ideas that Jerry and Norm have.
2:46:19
A huge influence.
2:46:20
Norm and he are very close friends, but they’re also close colleagues.
2:46:24
Yeah, they work together all the time.
2:46:28
In retrospect, how much of the Northwest Forest Plan has been about science,
2:46:32
and how much has been about politics?
2:46:36
[Laughs] Well, the whole thing’s developed on science.
2:46:38
Right.
2:46:39
But what to do with it afterwards?
2:46:41
It’s all politics.
2:46:42
And how it’s going to fare in the future is all politics, too.
2:46:45
And
2:46:48
you know, the influence of the plan has waxed and waned with
2:46:53
the changing administrations.
2:46:54
So, with the Bush [George W.] administration, the Northwest
2:46:57
Forest Plan started to have less and less influence, and there was
2:47:00
talk about sort of dismantling it.
2:47:02
And then, Obama came back, and the thing sort of came back into prominence again.
2:47:08
Right now, they’re still talking about pushing forward with the plan.
2:47:12
There’s no desire to dismantle the plan.
2:47:16
But who knows under the Trump administration, if there’s
2:47:19
going to be a big change.
2:47:21
Is there a genuine trepidation within the Forest Service?
2:47:24
This just happened.
2:47:25
[general election, less than one week before interview]
2:47:26
This just happened and I haven’t had a chance to talk to any
2:47:28
of my colleagues about it.
2:47:29
But I imagine that that there is.
2:47:31
I imagine there is.
2:47:33
Yeah.
2:47:33
Certainly, on the science side there is.
2:47:36
Well, even going back to Reagan, the research budget was slashed for
2:47:42
federal agency as a general rule.
2:47:43
With Interior and Agriculture and what have you.
2:47:51
What have we learned from the Northwest Forest Plan regarding
2:47:55
proactive management as well as the human limitations on managing nature?
2:48:05
Proactive management.
2:48:08
I think we are not very good at that right now, and we haven’t
2:48:11
learned enough to do it well.
2:48:13
And
2:48:16
it’s subject to so much debate.
2:48:18
For example, there is this huge issue now about managing to reduce
2:48:24
risk of a stand-replacing fire.
2:48:28
And this whole debate in biology about
2:48:35
how fire is presenting us such a big risk to future habitat conditions for
2:48:39
things like spotted owls, that we need to go in and proactively manage right
2:48:43
now to reduce that risk at the expense of perhaps damaging current habitat for
2:48:49
these species in the hopes of producing better habitat out into the future.
2:48:56
And we debate and debate and debate.
2:48:59
And we’ve had precious little science to inform which way to go.
2:49:03
We’ve tried to do things, we’ve done like simulation modeling and all that stuff.
2:49:07
But then every time we do models, then you start worrying about how realistic
2:49:11
these models really are and do the results of these models reflect reality.
2:49:17
We see a huge difference now.
2:49:19
The industry people think we need to go in there and start
2:49:22
proactively managing right now.
2:49:25
The skeptics say, they’re just looking for a way to get the harvest out and
2:49:28
using an excuse that there’s this huge risk of fire and the only way
2:49:32
they can get timber volume is to say they’re doing it to reduce fire hazard.
2:49:39
The environmental community, I mean, the timber community, is saying
2:49:42
that it’s true, there is this huge risk and if we don’t do something
2:49:46
now, we’re going to have even worse conditions out in the future.
2:49:51
So, there’s a big tension in that regard.
2:49:54
And in fact, I’m involved with an effort right now with the California
2:49:57
spotted owl to try to come to grips with that problem as we speak.
2:50:04
But there isn’t a really good large-scale design to try to come up with testable
2:50:13
programs to really inform that debate.
2:50:18
And it’s a really important one because there is reason to be skeptical
2:50:23
about whether these risks are being exaggerated or not and that fire
2:50:27
risk isn’t as bad as people say.
2:50:31
But at the same time, when you look at some of these models, fire-risk models,
2:50:34
that are saying there really is a big problem looming there, especially in
2:50:39
that part of the range where you have high-frequency, moderate-severity
2:50:43
fire that could be torching a lot of habitat over time, you think, my gosh.
2:50:50
That one is really big.
2:50:51
It seems to me that the trust issue is central here, or the lack thereof.
2:50:55
That underlies all of this.
2:50:58
But also, the timber industry is paying, shall we say, for
2:51:02
the sins of their forefathers.
2:51:04
You know, the excesses.
2:51:06
And
2:51:08
the environmentalists, who have, certainly their religiosity and piousness, which
2:51:16
is not so tolerant at times, but they also have evidence for some of that, too.
2:51:21
And so, it seems to me that those both are in play.
2:51:23
That’s exactly right.
2:51:24
Now, how do you think the Northwest Forest Plan has affected forest and natural
2:51:28
resource planning in the United States?
2:51:30
And you can substitute forest governance in there.
2:51:32
And how would you think it transfers or doesn’t transfer
2:51:36
to other biomes and ecologies?
2:51:38
And let’s just keep it in the North American context.
2:51:40
Yeah, I was immediately thinking of other continents even.
2:51:45
And if you want to extrapolate to that, that’s fine.
2:51:46
Well, we’ve had people from Australia, from Europe, who see what’s going
2:51:51
on with the Northwest Forest Plan, and see that as a model of how to
2:51:55
achieve conservation objectives.
2:51:57
But what they are amazed by is the commitment of resources to make it happen.
2:52:01
Because they see the wisdom in managing this way, but they
2:52:04
don’t see any way to fund it.
2:52:06
And how we’ve managed to fund something this big over so many years and to do
2:52:11
the monitoring that’s required to really see if it’s working the way it has,
2:52:17
it’s been a model for entities throughout the United States but
2:52:22
others throughout the world, but I don’t that anybody else has been able
2:52:26
to come up with the same commitment to try to implement the way we have.
2:52:30
It seems to me it’s only able to be considered in developed countries
2:52:34
where you have the resources and the infrastructure governmentally.
2:52:37
Yeah, that’s very true.
2:52:39
In Peru, where my wife is from, it’s obviously a much different
2:52:43
ecology, especially on the forestry side of the things in the Amazon.
2:52:46
You don’t have clear-cuts, you have rare, exotic hardwoods and selective cutting,
2:52:54
and it’s a much different dynamic.
2:52:56
I think it seems like a temperate zone type of thing, developed-economy zone.
2:53:02
I mean, the Australian dynamic is much different with
2:53:04
eucalypts and things like that.
2:53:06
It would seem to an odd match, if you’re going to be literal about it, except maybe
2:53:11
in the concepts loosely applied maybe?
2:53:13
That’s true.
2:53:14
But even in some of the developing countries, and I don’t know how you want
2:53:17
to rank India in that, remember, I told you about these trips to India we made.
2:53:21
But part of the reason for that was to try to export some of our concepts
2:53:25
of forest management to their forests.
2:53:28
And they’re really keen to take that on.
2:53:31
They can’t set aside huge tracts like we have, but they can bring principles
2:53:35
of conserving biodiversity within the areas they do manage, and say, we have
2:53:41
these indigenous people, who depend on the forests for non-timber forest
2:53:46
products, we need to find ways to meet their needs while providing the diverse
2:53:52
forest structures that are needed for the diverse wildlife that they have there
2:53:57
where it’s, orders of magnitude more diverse than what we’re used to seeing.
2:54:01
But they were trying to learn from us and trying to adapt some of our
2:54:04
techniques into their forests as well.
2:54:05
So, even in those countries that aren’t nearly at the level of
2:54:10
economic development we are, they’re still trying to gain from our
2:54:14
knowledge and manage their forests with a little bit of help from us.
2:54:19
What’s the most important thing you personally have learned from this whole
2:54:22
process around the Northwest Forest Plan, and even your move up here to
2:54:26
this area and your life being here?
2:54:29
The big question.
2:54:33
[Laughs]
2:54:33
I mean, to me, the biggest thing was just the opportunity to be involved with
2:54:39
something that earth-shaking, so to speak.
2:54:43
The most important thing I did throughout my whole career was being involved
2:54:47
with this effort, seeing the results of science go into crafting how land
2:54:55
management on a huge scale can take place.
2:54:59
And to actually use science to change the way we do things, to
2:55:04
achieve these ecological objectives.
2:55:06
To me, that was just an amazing experience and
2:55:12
definitely the high point of my whole career.
2:55:14
All that stuff I did was sort of leading to this effort in a way.
2:55:17
Well, that could not be a more perfect ending to this fantastic interview.
2:55:23
