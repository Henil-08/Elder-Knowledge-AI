00:02
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State
00:05
University College of Forestry.
00:07
It is November 15,
00:12
2016.
00:12
I am here in Issaquah, Washington, in the home of Dr. Jerry Franklin.
00:19
He is Professor of Forest Ecosystems at the University of Washington, and also,
00:24
he was Chief Plant Ecologist for many years with the U.S. Forest Service [PNW
00:29
Station] . We are here to do an interview centered on the Northwest Forest Plan,
00:34
but it will also include some aspects of Jerry’s long and distinguished career,
00:39
and it is part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project funded by the
00:43
PNW Station of the U.S. Forest Service.
00:45
Anyway, good afternoon, Jerry.
00:48
Hi, Sam.
00:49
Thank you for being willing to meet me.
00:52
Now, although we’ve done an interview before, it was centered on Mount
00:56
St. Helens, and so I’m going to ask you maybe some similar questions to
01:00
what I asked you before, for this opening part regarding your biography.
01:05
But perhaps, if we could gear it a little more toward forestry, ecosystems
01:09
science, and basically, how you became who you were in your career, and how it
01:13
relates to the Northwest Forest Plan?
01:15
So, I’ll ask you, just kind of give me a biographical sketch within that context.
01:20
How long do you want it?
01:21
As long as you want.
01:24
This thing goes as long as you, as long as the time you’ve got, Jerry.
01:28
Well,
01:32
how I got to where I am, I guess starts with my entering Oregon State University
01:42
in 1956 as a junior, and finally getting engaged as an actual forestry major.
01:52
And I got a bachelors there in 1959, got a Masters in Forestry there in 1961.
02:01
And when I was an undergraduate, I had a chance to get a student trainee
02:07
position with the PNW Station, who had a small contingent in a big room in
02:13
the basement of the forestry building.
02:16
And so, as soon as I graduated, I was immediately offered a full-time
02:23
position with the experiment station, Forest Service [Pacific Northwest]
02:26
Experiment Station, which I took.
02:29
And they helped me through a master’s program which was in forest management.
02:34
Then I did a Ph.D. in Botany at Washington State University with Rexford Daubenmire.
02:44
And a really key person for me in my career was Bill Ferrell, who was a
02:49
professor at Oregon State University.
02:53
So, in any case, I had a full-time position as a researcher with the
03:00
Forest Service Experiment Station.
03:03
In the ‘60s, I was focused primarily on silvicultural research, ecological
03:08
research related to upper-slope forests.
03:13
But towards the end of the ‘60s, I got involved in a workshop on the proposed
03:23
Coniferous Forest Biome Project of the U.S. International Biological
03:32
Program [IBP].
03:33
This was a program that was being
03:36
administered by the National Science Foundation and it was, [originated
03:42
because] they essentially were given a line item addition to their budget by the
03:46
United States Congress for this U.S. IBP.
03:51
And the U.S. committee in the IBP decided that they would
03:56
primarily focus on studying six types of ecosystems, six biomes.
04:04
One of them, well, there was a desert, there was an arctic alpine,
04:10
there was a tropical forest, there was a deciduous forest, there was a
04:14
desert, a grassland, and there was a
04:17
coniferous forest biome.
04:20
And the University of Washington had a workshop, i.e., they figured they had
04:25
the market cornered on this project, they were going to get all the money for it.
04:34
And a contingent of us came up from Corvallis, including
04:37
Dick Waring and Ted Dyrness.
04:39
Dick Waring was a young professor at Oregon State, and Ted Dyrness was
04:45
another Forest Service scientist.
04:46
But in any case, we decided we really wanted to get a piece
04:50
of that action for Corvallis.
04:55
And we had a heck of fight with the University of Washington over it, but
05:00
the bottom line was in the end, we cut a deal with the University of Washington.
05:07
They got the majority of it, but we got a big chunk
05:14
of that National Science Foundation money to work on the Coniferous Forest Biome.
05:20
This was an ecosystem study.
05:22
And this was about a six or seven year
05:25
- ? It was about ’69.
05:26
Yeah, and it lasted for about seven or eight years, correct?
05:28
It lasted for about six years.
05:30
Six years, right.
05:32
In any case, we then had a big dust-up at Oregon State University
05:40
over whether we were going to study a natural forest or a plantation.
05:46
And in the end, a group of us won out that, yeah, we were going to
05:50
study a natural forest system, it’s going to be an old-growth forest,
05:55
and it’s going to be down at the [H.J.] Andrews Experimental Forest.
06:01
So, we were successful in that regard.
06:06
And we decided to study a watershed that had been instrumented for
06:11
a number of years, in terms of water yields and water chemistry.
06:16
[Watershed] We went to work on it and
06:20
we made a decision after the first year we would really put
06:25
our money into a set of post-docs.
06:28
You know, the first year, we did the professor-graduate-student-thing
06:32
and we could see this wasn’t going to get us to where we needed to go.
06:36
So, we ended up hiring a group of post-docs as the primary people to
06:44
carry out the program, and we were very successful in that regard.
06:52
And the post-docs became the next generation of leaders.
06:58
But in any case, that was the beginning of my involvement in ecosystem research,
07:04
and it was really the beginning of
07:11
research on natural forests in the Northwest as ecosystems.
07:15
Now, Jerry, going back to the late ‘50s and early ‘60s as you were developing
07:20
some of the plans for studying the periodicity of cone and seed production,
07:26
both high-elevation and not-so-high elevation species, what do you remember
07:34
about your ideas going in and how you were trained, but how the results and
07:40
what you were finding out, that maybe was also informing how you would change what
07:46
you were studying and what you believed, you know, vis-à-vis traditional forestry,
07:50
utilitarian forestry, versus ecosystem science, and what became the New Forestry?
07:57
Well, that first decade I worked for the experiment station, I was pretty
08:03
much boxed into doing traditional work.
08:07
And so, what I did do was focus my work on the ecology of
08:13
the constituent tree species.
08:16
That was mostly what I did.
08:23
My perspective at that point was pretty traditional, but I
08:30
definitely was interested in learning more about old-growth forests
08:34
and the Forest Service wasn’t.
08:37
Ted Dyrness and I, in the late ‘60s, really began to do some bootleg work,
08:47
beginning to do some very descriptive work of the old growth in the Andrews
08:52
area, as part of the classification study.
08:55
Was that part of your overall vegetation work in the Pacific Northwest?
09:00
That was my vegetation work.
09:00
That’s correct.
09:02
So,
09:04
when Ted and I and Dick Waring went up to Seattle to participate in that IBP
09:10
workshop, I didn’t really have much idea at all of what an ecosystem was about.
09:22
You know, they didn’t teach us about that in forestry school.
09:27
So, it was totally a new subject.
09:29
They talked about structure and function of ecosystems.
09:32
And at that point, I didn’t have a ghost of an idea what the hell they were talking
09:36
about, but I figured I could find out.
09:41
The interesting thing for me, was that not only did I shift completely
09:47
in my perspective as an ecologist
09:53
and a forester from a traditional point-of-view, really with regards
09:58
to both forestry and ecology,
10:02
to this ecosystem perspective.
10:06
But also, I had purposely avoided being involved with Douglas-fir
10:12
forests, because I figured everybody knew everything about those already.
10:17
Because they were the prime merchantable species and they’d studied that forever.
10:21
Exactly, and so they’d studied that forever.
10:22
What
10:24
I didn’t realize at the time was no one had studied natural Douglas-fir
10:29
forests, and certainly not as ecosystems.
10:34
So, I found myself now spending, you know, the majority of my time looking
10:40
at Douglas-fir—hemlock forests.
10:42
Now, had you read, or you probably have since then, the survey of the Douglas-fir
10:48
forest region, the famous one that was done by H.J. Andrews and R.W. Cowlin?
10:52
[Survey of the Douglas-fir Region, 1940.]
10:52
Oh,
10:55
sure.
10:55
How would you characterize that study today from what you know now?
10:59
Well, it really was very much of a traditional inventory.
11:03
And, it had to do with large and small saw timber.
11:11
Merchantable timber.
11:11
Merchantable wood.
11:12
Yeah.
11:13
And so,
11:17
there really wasn’t
11:22
much interest in learning anything about the character of the natural
11:27
forest because we were just going to cut those down anyway, and we’re going
11:30
to convert them to managed-forests.
11:36
So, you’re in the 1970s, there’s the IBP program, and then the momentum builds,
11:44
maybe with the help of the post-docs, paradigm shifts in society, post-Earth
11:49
Day culture, etc., and you move on into the EER [Experimental Ecological
11:53
Reserve] transition to what became LTER.
11:56
And I take it that during that decade, let’s say, the ‘70s from the
12:00
IBP until the beginning of the LTER,
12:04
you were transforming your ideas about forests across the spectrum.
12:09
In other words, it was no longer, oh, here’s just these species
12:12
that are going to be used for this purpose, this is a very simple model.
12:15
And you started to see how multifaceted it was, and how complex it was.
12:22
Absolutely did, but I also had a really significant detour because I
12:29
got involved in this ecosystem study.
12:32
The National Science Foundation took a look at me and said, “We’d like for you
12:37
to come back and be program officer for
12:43
this program.” And so, in 1973,
12:53
I transferred from the Forest Service to the National Science Foundation, and
12:59
I became the program officer, the first Program Officer for Ecosystem Studies.
13:06
They established a new program.
13:08
And it was a really critical period because the IBP money was ending.
13:13
I was there right at that point-in-time.
13:17
The National Science Foundation made the decision that what we’re going
13:21
to do, is we’re not going to stop now, we’re going to just convert that
13:28
money that’s been IBP, to funding an ecosystem studies program, and Jerry,
13:34
you are the first officer for that.
13:39
[Phone rings] I’m not going to answer that.
13:42
So, in any case, I spent two years at the National Science Foundation, sort
13:48
of moving through the ending of IBP and the beginning of a whole series
13:56
of new, post-IBP ecosystem studies.
14:00
And it was a ball.
14:03
That was also the time period in which we began to talk about how
14:08
we can provide longer- term support for some of these kinds of programs.
14:15
In other words, continuous.
14:16
LTER was born in that period of 1973 to ’75.
14:23
Now, it took almost a decade
14:28
for it to evolve into a functioning program.
14:32
But that was where the discussions began within the National Science
14:38
Foundation that led, ultimately to LTER.
14:42
When you were doing traditional forestry, right leading up to ’69 and
14:46
’70 when this all started, did you have doubts, questions about things
14:52
that you would later answer when you became trained and immersed in this
14:57
new world of ecosystems science?
14:59
Well, yes, in a way.
15:02
Because I’d always been interested in old-growth forests.
15:08
That was, I grew up in them.
15:12
So, we didn’t know anything about old-growth forests at all, other than the
15:18
fact they were very impressive, and they were also, one heck of a big wood pile.
15:26
And what I realized in that first half of the ‘70s, was that we had
15:35
developed a basic understanding of what these natural old forests were about.
15:44
We had the beginnings of a comprehensive understanding.
15:49
I thought at that time, and I think others thought similarly, that, wow, this is
15:56
terrific, but what we’re really doing is
16:02
essentially creating historic knowledge, as those systems are all going to be
16:08
cut down, they’re all going to be gone.
16:10
We are going to have them do a thorough analysis of it, so at least
16:17
we’ll have a record of what it was.
16:19
So, we had no thought as we went through the ’70s that there would
16:24
be a major change in policy.
16:29
Now, when you were younger, and even when you were in your young professional
16:33
career, would you say that you looked at, shall we say, the impressive nature
16:39
of old-growth forests in terms of their spiritual and aesthetic impact?
16:45
Yes.
16:45
Not science, you know, the things that you would learn about how essential
16:51
they are to ecosystem health, in fact.
16:55
Absolutely correct.
16:56
But you didn’t know that, but you still were impressed, you just didn’t know
16:59
that it was this other stuff, also?
17:01
But I knew they had to be special, that we just didn’t know about them.
17:12
About the only thing we knew about old-growth forests at that point, and in
17:19
my lecturing on this, I often tell people, if you would have asked me in 1960, tell
17:24
me something about old-growth forests, I wouldn’t have had anything to tell you.
17:30
We had no significant scientific knowledge of old forests.
17:34
Now, that isn’t quite true, but it’s almost true, because we did have
17:40
some understanding of the quality of the water coming out of those
17:44
forests, and it was outstanding.
17:47
And so, I always had this intuitive feeling, if we ever had a chance
17:55
to do some study, some research on these forests, we would find
18:00
out all kinds of exciting things.
18:03
We just hadn’t had the opportunity, and that’s exactly what happened.
18:11
I don’t think I realized at the beginning of the ‘60s that we were
18:15
going to develop as broad a vision, as comprehensive a vision of these
18:22
forests, as we did during that decade.
18:27
But we went from essentially very little knowledge to a fundamental understanding.
18:35
So that when somebody, in this case some people on the Siuslaw National
18:39
Forest, asked us to tell them what an old-growth forest is, that we know
18:41
it’s more than just big-old trees.
18:41
We had a basis by that point-in-time, to say, okay, this is what it is.
18:41
By the early ‘80s or the late ‘70s?
18:41
Well, we did our first workshop to try to bring our vision together in ’78.
18:41
And, you know, it was pretty rudimentary.
18:41
It’s embarrassing now, and that’s the document.
18:41
For the record, I’m referring to a foundational publication called
18:41
“Ecological characteristics of old-growth Douglas-fir forests.” Jerry Franklin
18:41
was the primary author; also, Kermit Cromack, Jr., Phil Sollins, Bill
18:41
Denison, Arthur McKee, Chris Maser, James Sedell, Fred Swanson and Glenn Juday.
18:41
Do you want to tell me about how the ‘70s crystallized all the work you did and the
18:41
awareness into this foundational document?
18:41
That workshop was done, really, it was stimulated by the query from the
18:41
national forests, the people in the Siuslaw National Forest, who said, “Tell
18:41
us what an old-growth forest is.” And
19:55
so, what I did was to say, “Well, we’d better get a bunch of us together that
20:01
have been working on it,” and we spent a week at Wind River [Experimental
20:08
Forest] in the training center, and basically produced that document.
20:13
Now, before that time, people had different terms.
20:18
Old growth was a term, but they just didn’t know what it was.
20:20
But there were also interchangeable terms; climax forests, virgin
20:25
forests, some of the terms often used.
20:27
Right?
20:27
Sure, sure.
20:28
And what’s the problem with climax?
20:31
Well, the problem with climax forest, is technically, a climax
20:35
forest is one that essentially is self-perpetuating in the absence of some
20:41
kind of major disturbance, and isn’t undergoing any changes in composition.
20:48
In fact, because Douglas-fir is so long-lived, any forest with a Douglas-fir
20:56
forest with Douglas-fir still in it, certainly in the moist part of the
21:00
forest region, is not a climax forest.
21:03
It’s still got its pioneer, which is the Douglas-fir.
21:07
And so, it is not a climax forest.
21:12
It is, however, an old forest.
21:15
That’s some of the legacy of the early ecologists such as
21:18
Clements and people like that.
21:20
Sure, technically, you’d have to have a forest that no
21:25
longer, the Douglas-fir had died out of it, and the hemlocks and the cedars
21:30
had taken over, because they are tolerant and they are perpetuating.
21:35
But Douglas-fir is so long-lived that almost none of our forests have ever
21:42
started with Douglas-fir and survived long enough, that they lost all of
21:46
their Douglas-fir . So, they weren’t climax forests in a technical sense.
21:53
So, you’re at the NSF, you come back.
21:57
And I come back and I’m a project leader.
22:00
For the Forest Service?
22:02
For the Forest Service [Pacific Northwest Research Station]
22:02
. But you’re also the PI at the Andrews?
22:05
Yeah, I wasn’t initially when I came back.
22:09
You know, Dick Waring had sort of been the PI for Oregon State.
22:15
But, Dick
22:19
really wasn’t interested in
22:24
heading
22:28
up a very broad program.
22:32
Dick’s always had very specific interests and a very specific way of doing things.
22:39
And he really wasn’t that interested in sort of leading a team of
22:45
people for a long period of time.
22:49
So, when I came back from Washington, D.C., I was the Project Leader for the
22:56
Forest Service with the responsibility for the H.J. Andrews Experimental
23:01
Forest, and with responsibility for Cascade Head Experimental Forest as well.
23:08
And so, I was well-positioned and I had a lot of Forest Service resources
23:14
that were under my jurisdiction, and I was in a really good position then, to
23:22
merge those with funds we were getting from the National Science Foundation.
23:28
That’s what we did.
23:30
Ultimately, it was in 1979-80 that we produced our first LTER proposal.
23:43
It was at that time that I really took over the leadership, and Dick
23:49
Waring pretty much dropped out.
23:54
But Dick was a real pivotal figure.
23:56
He was a pivotal figure in the IBP, especially.
24:00
How did you two complement each other?
24:03
I mean, you were very different in how you saw science.
24:06
He was much more quantitative-centered.
24:08
Is that true?
24:09
Much more quantitative, much more hypothesis-oriented, and had very specific
24:18
interests, where I’ve always had a very broad, general interest in the ecology
24:25
and natural history of these forests.
24:28
And in terms of the kinds of paradigm shifts we’re talking about, it’s not
24:32
just scientific, it’s probably cultural.
24:37
We’re going to take a break for a second.
24:38
[Break] Okay, we’re back on the record after a short break.
24:41
Well, basically Dick was involved in it all through the ‘70s, but when
24:46
we actually developed the first LTER proposal, it became pretty clear
24:53
shortly after we got the first LTER grant, that this was not something that
24:57
he really wanted to continue to run.
25:01
So, I took over that responsibility of being PI on the LTER grant as well.
25:09
So, this would have been LTER 1, correct?
25:11
Yes, it was.
25:14
For the record, even though we’re going to talk about the Northwest Forest
25:16
Plan and the Forest Wars here real shortly, tell me a little bit more
25:20
about the transition into the EER, the Experimental Ecological Reserve, there
25:26
was kind of a little era, and then all of a sudden it changed to LTER.
25:32
Why did the terminology change and how did that come about?
25:35
Well, I wasn’t in the National Science Foundation during that five
25:44
years from ’75 to ’80, so I know that the concept of these long-term
25:51
funding things was very controversial and had to undergo an evolution.
25:57
They even had two workshops that
26:04
were supposedly designing what LTER was supposed to be.
26:09
But in the end,
26:14
as it finally emerged, the assistant director for “Bio” within NSF at that
26:23
point-in-time, decided that she really wanted these to be individually-competed,
26:32
hypothesis-based, long-term grants.
26:37
And so, I think Long-Term Ecological Research moved
26:42
the focus away from a place,
26:47
and much more to something that was more traditional and that
26:53
she was more comfortable with.
26:56
There was a lot of
27:02
controversy within the ecological community about these, and a lot of
27:10
discussion and controversy within NSF about exactly what these should
27:18
be.
27:19
So, it was sort of a close-run thing, I think, the decision on the part of
27:27
NSF to go ahead with this program.
27:30
But LTER, Long-Term Ecological Research, I think, was the name that
27:36
they finally adopted as being one that they were comfortable with.
27:44
It’s very interesting how what would become the science and the
27:48
process of the Northwest Forest Plan, monitoring all the things that
27:52
would happen, essentially would also have components of that thing to it.
27:58
Huge components of it.
28:00
Huge components.
28:01
And how would you characterize the transition from a more deductive
28:09
perspective on science and management with a kind of an atomistic view of
28:13
the world versus a more holistic, shall we say, inductive view, which I think
28:20
ecosystems science, and certainly the New Forestry, and all those things
28:23
definitely incorporate at least large elements of that with deductive studies
28:27
still being there, but it shifted, it was kind of inverted, and one
28:31
was within the context of the other?
28:34
Well, it was very controversial.
28:36
It was very controversial within the ecological science community; it
28:41
was very controversial within NSF.
28:43
And there was great antagonism against IBP
28:50
by many of the traditional ecologists because
28:58
it wasn’t really hypothesis-based science at all.
29:04
It approached it in a very different way.
29:07
And so that was essentially what I just said, I mean, you had methods
29:11
and paradigms and models, but
29:16
it was inverted.
29:16
It was more like, okay, let’s see what all this stuff tells us,
29:21
independent of some structure.
29:23
Absolutely.
29:23
Is that fair enough to say?
29:25
And it would have been fair to say that when we started doing this
29:29
research at the Andrews, we really didn’t have any hypotheses at all.
29:35
What we decided was, okay, we get to study these systems.
29:41
I guess, the first thing we’d better do is a carbon budget, a nutrient budget,
29:46
and a water budget, and see what we learn.
29:50
And of course, you didn’t get very far into
29:57
trying to fill in the pieces of a budget before interesting things begin to emerge.
30:07
And so there, then you were beginning to develop, you know, things
30:14
that were more susceptible to a hypothesis-based kind of a science.
30:20
Once you got the momentum in, shall we say, an extended database and sets of
30:25
observations that can tell you something independent of going into with this
30:30
different model or question or deductive pair, right, when you say that question?
30:34
Right.
30:34
Yeah.
30:34
So,
30:37
let’s go back to forestry.
30:39
You’re in the LTER era.
30:43
What was happening in the Pacific Northwest?
30:45
I mean, you had the 1976 National Forest Management Act, which, for
30:52
its day and considering where it came from, was still fairly progressive.
30:57
It was tremendously progressive.
30:59
There’s a book out
31:05
by a fellow by the name of James Skillen [Federal Ecosystem Management] that is
31:09
really quite good at relating some of that historical development including the
31:14
National Forest Management Act of ’76.
31:17
But
31:20
effectively, the way the NFMA was written, there really was no
31:29
alternative but to ultimately adopt an ecosystem perspective on forests.
31:36
You have to realize that up until that time, forestry was traditionally
31:44
based on the view of a forest as being a collection of trees.
31:49
And you manage that collection of trees to produce wood, more than anything else.
31:55
So, that was the most important thing that you were getting from the forest.
31:59
And the “softer” values would have been couched in still humanistic
32:03
values, recreation, for example.
32:05
Right, but nevertheless, the professional forester was trained to
32:10
think about the forest as a collection of trees, not as an ecosystem.
32:15
And in fact, back in 1950, we wouldn’t have, there was no science to support
32:24
a view of the forest as an ecosystem.
32:27
One of the things that’s happened in the last 60 years of my lifetime, has been,
32:32
we’ve gone from this very simplistic vision of a forest as a collection
32:37
of trees, to a very comprehensive knowledge of forests as ecosystems.
32:44
And interestingly, that perspective was reflected in legislation like
32:53
the ESA, like NFMA, like NEPA, before it was reflected in the attitudes of
33:00
the professional resource managers.
33:04
And even with many scientists.
33:06
Absolutely.
33:08
And so, it’s almost like the cultural and political paradigm shift
33:13
predicted the science, in some ways.
33:16
Well, yes, except what happened, I think interestingly, was that
33:22
some of our leaders in policy recognized very early on the
33:34
importance of the idea of the ecosystem.
33:38
And the whole notion that everything is in fact linked together.
33:46
Rachel Carson gets some credit for that.
33:48
Aldo Leopold gets some credit for that.
33:51
But in any case, the ecosystem perspective became incorporated into legislation
34:02
that forced ultimately resource managers to begin to view systems
34:10
that way and manage them that way.
34:13
How long did it take you to realize what these laws meant?
34:18
Well, I didn’t realize where things were going to be going.
34:23
Right up through the ‘70s and into the ‘80s, I didn’t anticipate
34:27
a major change in policy.
34:30
So,
34:34
I really didn’t understand the legislation that well or what the
34:38
implications of it was, and it took about ten to fifteen years for it
34:46
to be sorted out through litigation.
34:52
Ultimately the courts were the interpreters of what the laws
34:56
meant, and I don’t think the agencies themselves understood the
35:03
significance of what had gone on.
35:07
That was why, ultimately, they were unable to come to grips with it.
35:14
They failed.
35:15
And even develop plans that would be able to hold cultural,
35:19
political and legal muster.
35:20
Well, that’s right.
35:21
I mean, it took them, I believe, in the Oregon and Washington areas that
35:26
became the Northwest Forest Plan area, all of the forests, it took
35:30
them 10, 11, 12 years, to come up and basically finish all these forest plans.
35:37
But when it came down to legal challenges, none of them held up.
35:40
None of them held up.
35:41
Absolutely.
35:43
I mean, they tried.
35:45
They tried, but they failed.
35:47
Why did they fail?
35:48
They failed because they didn’t understand that the laws really meant what they said.
35:57
They thought they could still pigeon-hole them within the old paradigm.
35:59
They thought that this was all essentially verbiage, but the reality was in the
36:06
end, we’re going to cut a lot of wood.
36:08
And so,
36:13
they could not believe that in fact, they would be forced
36:18
to change their priorities.
36:22
Now, during the ‘60s and ‘70s, and the early ‘80s, what do you remember
36:29
seeing and feeling and knowing about the traditional industrial
36:35
forestry and the clear-cutting, that was still going on as it had?
36:39
Well,
36:42
what was becoming very clear to me was that, first of all,
36:53
it was not taking account of a great many of the values that were out
36:58
there, and that we were going to have to make some significant changes.
37:03
So, I was believing that there was going to have to be change, but I thought it
37:09
was going to be an evolutionary change rather than a revolutionary change.
37:14
And so, I began to really try to think about things like a
37:18
kinder and gentler forestry.
37:20
I began to think about and talk about leaving trees behind.
37:24
That’s the “New Forestry.” [Term used in 1980s/1990s to describe
37:25
not-clear-cut centered, lighter impact methods, more “progressive” forestry.]
37:27
Not clear-cutting.
37:29
And so,
37:35
even I remember in the late ‘80s, meeting with the…….what were they called?
37:45
The “big eight” conservation organizations.
37:49
You know,
37:51
I think there are eight of them.
37:52
Well, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, was the Isaac Walton League
37:56
considered one of those eight?
37:59
Yeah, and Audubon.
37:59
Audubon, whatever, I can’t remember all of them.
38:01
So, they had a meeting in Portland, and they invited me and the Regional Forester
38:09
[Region] to come and talk with them.
38:11
One of the questions they asked us, is how much of the remaining old growth
38:15
do you think we’re going to save?
38:17
We both gave the same answer, which was half, and we were wrong.
38:25
Both of us were wrong, that ultimately indicated, this is
38:28
going to be a revolutionary change, it’s not going to be evolutionary.
38:33
And the interesting thing about the Northwest Forest Plan was,
38:38
we weren’t asked to preserve all the old growth; that isn’t what
38:44
President Clinton asked us to do.
38:46
He asked us to develop a scientifically-credible
38:48
plan that was legal
38:51
for management of the forests within the range of the northern spotted owl.
38:57
So, we came up with a plan that left out some of the mature and old
39:02
forests, because we didn’t think we needed to set it all aside.
39:07
Which, I believe, in terms of the ten alternatives that came up, the
39:11
one that saved the most or all was called the “green dream,” correct?
39:15
Yes, as far as that goes, the Northwest Forest Plan was a green dream.
39:22
There wasn’t an environmentalist out there that could believe what we did.
39:27
Because essentially, we flipped the perspective on the national forests
39:34
exactly 180 degrees, from an emphasis on timber to an emphasis on ecology.
39:40
But it didn’t set aside all of the old growth.
39:43
But the minute after the Northwest Forest Plan [NWFP] was passed, they began
39:47
to try to log some of the old growth that was allowable under the – [NWFP]
39:52
- In the Matrix and AMA’s, correct?
39:54
[Zoning categories in NWFP.]
39:55
Yeah, and immediately, there was a societal response, the essence of which
40:03
was, it may be okay from a scientist point-of-view, but it’s not okay with us.
40:11
So, where society was on it was essentially, no, you’re not
40:16
going to cut any more old forest.
40:19
We’re going to come out here, we’re going to hang in the trees, and we’re going
40:23
to lie down in front of the bulldozers.
40:25
Basically, the politicians and agency people decided we
40:30
can’t manage forests this way.
40:33
We can’t have to go out and put a bunch of people in jail
40:36
every time we do a timber sale.
40:38
So, they quit.
40:40
They just quit trying to cut old growth.
40:44
You know, they’d take a swing now and then, and they’d get backed down.
40:48
In the end, basically, the agency said, this isn’t working.
40:54
In fact,
40:58
they just stopped doing regeneration harvesting.
41:03
Now, the thought didn’t ever occur to them, well, we could go
41:06
into the plantations and do that and probably get away with it.
41:10
They didn’t do that.
41:11
They still don’t.
41:13
Now, when was the first time, within the context of what you know now and
41:17
knew then, about endangered species and the Endangered Species Act, that you
41:23
heard about the [northern] spotted owl?
41:25
Well, I heard about it in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, because a lot of the
41:31
research was going on at the Andrews.
41:35
A lot of Eric’s work.
41:39
Eric Forsman?
41:39
Eric Forsman’s work was it, and I knew Eric.
41:44
So,
41:48
I knew about the northern spotted owl, but in the mid-’80s, if you’d told me
41:54
that we’re going to stop essentially logging all of the old-growth forests
42:02
because of the northern spotted owl, I would have said I don’t really
42:05
believe that’s going to happen.
42:08
I couldn’t believe it.
42:10
And I think that’s one of the reasons why the environmental organizations
42:17
were very concerned about listing the northern spotted owl, and debated
42:23
whether or not they were concerned, this could break the Endangered Species Act.
42:29
Now, if I recall, the agency that hedged the longest was the
42:33
[U.S.] Fish and Wildlife Service.
42:34
Correct?
42:37
Franklin: First of all, the agency interfered politically in the listing
42:42
process the first time, and got whacked down by the judge for doing that.
42:48
They went back through it, and did have to list it when they approached
42:54
it totally on a scientific basis.
42:56
So, that was political involvement by the elder Bush administration
43:02
in the listing process.
43:05
The listing is supposed to be based entirely on scientific
43:08
criteria, and they hadn’t done that.
43:12
But even before that, it wasn’t one of the major environmental
43:18
organizations that petitioned for listing of the northern spotted owl.
43:23
It was a little organization [Green World] because the big ones were all
43:28
afraid that if this bird gets listed, this could break the Endangered Species Act.
43:35
Because in fact, is they try to shut down logging in the old-growth
43:41
forests in the Northwest based on the listing of a species,
43:46
somebody’s going to change the act.
43:50
So, they couldn’t believe it.
43:53
The elder Bush administration couldn’t believe
43:58
it.
43:58
The Forest Service itself couldn’t believe that this is what was going to happen.
44:04
And so, they failed.
44:07
And in the end, when the judge in Seattle [William Dwyer] finally said,
44:13
no more timber harvesting within the range of the northern spotted owl
44:17
until you have a credible plan for sustaining the northern spotted owl.
44:26
When that finally happened, nobody would believe the agencies any more.
44:32
So, what did they do?
44:33
They got a whole bunch of scientists in this building in Portland, and
44:40
we weren’t trained to make plans.
44:43
But we did.
44:44
Glen Juday got us all together.
44:45
There wasn’t a decision-maker [manager] in that group.
44:53
Incidentally, there wasn’t a decision-maker involved in the
44:57
Gang of Four report, either.
45:01
Basically, it was totally an effort on the part of scientists, federal and
45:10
otherwise.
45:10
Going back to the start of this process, late ‘80s.
45:15
The ISC report, the Gang of Four report, and the EIS’s.
45:20
I think there were different ones [EIS reports] on the spotted owl.
45:22
There was one in ’91 or one in ‘92.
45:23
Yeah.
45:24
And then you had FEMAT, the thing that came out of the Pink Tower camp.
45:28
[Scientists in Bank of America building in Portland, Oregon, for
45:28
ninety days, to devise scientific alternatives for managing NSO region.]
45:28
Right.
45:28
Camp or slumber party, I jokingly call it.
45:32
The “90-day slumber party”?
45:34
It was interesting.
45:36
But how did that come about?
45:40
For instance, tell me about Jack’s role, but also how the Gang of
45:45
Four came together, and how these strong personalities, very talented
45:53
scientists in their own right, in different disciplines and
45:56
sub-disciplines, how they came together?
45:58
But start with Jack first.
46:00
[Jack Ward Thomas]
46:00
Well, there’s a sequence here, and it does start with Jack.
46:06
It starts with Jack before the judge shuts everything down when the chief
46:14
of the Forest Service goes to Jack and says, “Jack, I want you to get all the
46:20
owl biologists together and I want you to provide me with a scientifically
46:24
credible plan for sustaining the spotted owl on the national forests.
46:30
Okay?” He said, “I want a plan and I want
46:36
it to be scientifically credible, but also try to design it to minimize impacts on
46:43
other Forest Service activities.” Between the lines, that was trying to minimize
46:50
impacts on allowable cut. So, Jack did that. And that started, I think, in ’89.
46:57
That’s the ISC report?
46:59
That’s the ISC report.
47:00
Then it was published in ’91.
47:03
And that’s an acronym for Interagency Scientific Committee?
47:07
Committee.
47:08
Right.
47:09
Well,
47:15
they did a heroic thing.
47:19
I was absolutely stunned when I saw the report, because they did two things.
47:23
First of all, they said the basic strategy that’s been proposed out there
47:30
to essentially provide habitat for so many pairs of owls in isolation,
47:38
isn’t going to work.
47:39
He said we’ve known that all along.
47:41
We’ve known
47:44
all along that we really need large contiguous blocks of habitat
47:50
which will sustain 20 or more pairs of owls.
47:56
So, these little individual habitat preserves aren’t going to do anything.
48:02
They aren’t going to succeed.
48:04
Instead, we need to essentially have large habitat blocks and many pairs of owls.
48:13
That was a total break with everything we’d previously heard, all the
48:18
stuff that had gone on before.
48:22
And furthermore, even though they were trying to cut slack, the impact was huge.
48:31
And you know, basically they proposed about 7 million acres
48:36
of Habitat Conservation Areas.
48:40
In the ISC report?
48:41
In the ISC report.
48:43
So, big impact on timber harvest.
48:46
And so that report went back to the chief [U.S. Forest Service]
48:49
. And that was Dale Robertson at that time?
48:50
It was Dale Robertson.
48:51
Dale
48:54
went to the White House after the shutdown by the judge, and said,
48:58
“Can I implement this report?” And they said, “No, you can’t.
49:05
Too big an impact on timber harvest.”
49:09
This was during, right when Clinton was in, or was this still Bush?
49:11
No, this was elder Bush.
49:13
That’s what I thought.
49:14
This was 1990-91.
49:15
Okay, that’s what I thought.
49:17
Okay, so it was ’90.
49:22
Nothing happened for about 18 months.
49:26
The elder Bush administration was running around thinking there’s
49:29
got to be some way around this.
49:31
This can’t be.
49:33
We’ve got to find some wildlife people that will say, no,
49:35
you don’t have to do that.
49:36
Well, that didn’t work.
49:38
We’ve got to find an alternative way of doing this to this.
49:43
And the BLM had all kinds of proposals.
49:47
We’ll raise owls and release them.
49:52
There was all kinds of weird stuff.
49:57
So, nothing happened.
50:00
So, in ’91,
50:05
two committees of the United States House of Representatives
50:09
decided to get together, to which a third one adhered in the end.
50:14
So, there were three committees and three subcommittees.
50:18
They said, “We’re going to call in these guys, these experts, and have
50:25
them explain to us what the hell’s going on, and what we have to do to get out
50:31
of it.” These three House committees met together, for the Gang of Four to
50:39
come and tell them, you know, each of us in our own way, what’s going on.
50:43
And so, there was Norm [Johnson] , there was me, there was John Gordon,
50:47
and there was Jack Ward Thomas.
50:50
Who came up with the name the “Gang of Four”?
50:52
Well, the industry came up with it afterwards.
50:55
You mean, timber industry?
50:56
Timber industry, because it was pejorative.
50:59
That’s what I was going to say, it wasn’t complimentary.
51:01
It was pejorative, absolutely.
51:03
So anyway, we went in there, and we didn’t coordinate anything beforehand.
51:09
We just each went in and talked about our subjects.
51:14
Norm blew them away, because he said - he was a recognized man about allowable cut
51:21
- we’ve been overcutting for a long time.
51:28
They wanted him to tell them how much, and he’s a very conservative guy.
51:32
He wasn’t going to tell them what he really thought, but he said
51:38
quite a bit, maybe ten percent.
51:41
And the thing about allowable cut is, it’s the maximum that
51:45
you could possibly harvest if everything worked out perfectly.
51:48
And it never does.
51:50
But we’ve been cutting that amount anyway, and so we’ve really been
51:55
overcutting on these national forests for quite a long time now.
52:00
That was stunning to them.
52:03
And I told them about the old-growth forests, that this was really about an
52:09
ecosystem, it wasn’t really about a bird.
52:14
Jack talked to them about the owl and what the owl committee people said.
52:20
Incidentally, one other thing I’ll come back to, that report of the
52:26
Thomas Committee [ISC] did one other incredible thing, and that had to
52:31
do with the 50-11-40 rule, what you do to areas in between the habitat
52:38
conservation areas [Rule refers to 50 percent of land between HCAs having
52:41
stands of at least 11 inches in average diameter, and a 40 percent canopy cover]
52:41
. And that would be analogous to what later would be the Matrix in the AMAs
52:45
in the context of the late successional reserves in the Northwest Forest Plan.
52:49
Correct, more or less?
52:50
Yeah, in a way.
52:51
Yeah, okay.
52:52
But anyway, we went off after giving this testimony to
53:02
a back room in one of the House office buildings, and were sitting
53:08
there with several committee members.
53:11
I was sitting close to Harold Volkmer.
53:18
[D-MO] Now, Volkmer was a Southern Democrat, well-respected by both sides of
53:23
the House, both Republicans and Democrats.
53:31
He was sitting there, and he was chair of the House Agriculture Committee, which
53:38
had included the forestry subcommittee.
53:41
He was writing on a back of an envelope, and I said, “Congressman,
53:49
what are you writing?” He said, “Well, I’m writing down what we have to put into
53:55
a bill, in order to solve this problem.” “Oh, you’re writing our law on the back of
54:01
an envelope?” That’s what I was thinking.
54:05
He went back to what he was doing, and about thirty seconds later, he
54:08
looked up, looked at me, and he said, “You know, if you could just tell us
54:11
where the good old-growth is, we could solve this problem.” I said, “Well,
54:18
we can do that.” I don’t know how we could do that, but we can do that.
54:28
Jack Ward Thomas was trying to kick me, and he was kicking Norm Johnson instead.
54:32
Norm will tell you this story probably, but
54:40
that led to, “Well, here’s what we want you to do.
54:43
We want you
54:46
to go back to the Northwest, you four, and we want you to map all the old
54:53
growth, grade it as to its quality, and give us a plan for what we should
55:02
put into legislation to solve this problem.” And we were kind of playing,
55:11
and after having said that, I’m not sure we really want to do this.
55:15
Well, you weren’t sure that you wanted to put a number or a box
55:19
around an idea that you hadn’t really had a chance to flesh out yet.
55:23
Well, that’s right, and besides that, who’s going to pay for this?
55:29
And well, there goes my sabbatical.
55:33
But anyway,
55:37
he said, “Well, if you don’t want to do it, we will do it.” Oh boy,
55:44
that had us by the short hairs. Boy,
55:49
no one’s going to map and characterize the quality of old
55:53
growth, my old-growth forest, but me.
55:56
I don’t want any congressional staffers doing this.
56:00
So, they had us, and sent us home.
56:03
But, as we went out the door, literally as we went out the door, Volkmer said, “Oh,
56:11
and one more thing, don’t forget the fish.
56:16
We don’t want some damn fish blowing us out of the water after we’ve
56:21
got this thing solved.” And so, Congressional folks knew right away,
56:28
it wasn’t just about owls, it was really about old-growth systems.
56:33
Volkmer was very aware that it wasn’t just about the terrestrial part
56:37
of that system, it was very much about the water part, too, and fish.
56:42
And so, the “Gang of Four” became the “Gang of Four - Plus Two.” And
56:48
we wanted to be the Gang of Six, but they wouldn’t let us do that.
56:52
But Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves became, you know, equivalents.
56:59
Co-partners in the aquatic side of things?
57:01
Co-partners on the aquatic side.
57:03
So, now we’ve got it all.
57:04
We’ve got the forest ecosystem, including the streams, worried about fish, worried
57:11
about owls, worried about murrelets, worried about all old-growth systems.
57:16
Although the murrelets weren’t quite in the equation yet, at
57:18
the start, is that correct?
57:19
They were.
57:20
They were?
57:22
Okay.
57:23
Yes, they were in the Gang of Four exercise.
57:28
So, even in this first report?
57:30
Even in this 1991 report.
57:33
And he’s talking about the “Alternatives for Management of Late Successional
57:36
Forests of the Pacific Northwest.”
57:37
Right.
57:38
Which is co-authored by the Gang of Four: Norm, Jerry, Jack and John.
57:42
Right.
57:43
So, Norm can tell you the story better than I can.
57:47
So, but we come back to the Northwest and they want this done in a month.
57:54
So, how are we going to do
58:00
this all?
58:01
The congressional people had essentially said to the Department of Agriculture,
58:07
in fact, to both departments, Interior and Ag, give these people whatever
58:12
resources they need in terms of personnel.
58:17
And this is still Bush administration?
58:19
This is still the Bush administration.
58:20
But you do have Democratic Congress, though.
58:23
Senate and the House?
58:24
You’ve got a Democratic House.
58:26
Right, but not the Senate?
58:27
Not the Senate.
58:28
Senate’s Republican.
58:29
Okay.
58:31
So, I figured out, okay, how am I going to get the best
58:36
assessment of old-growth forests?
58:38
I’m going to pull in all of those staff people out there on the forests and on
58:44
the BLM districts, the biologists, the silviculturalists, the aquatic biologists,
58:52
the wildlife people, who know their properties very well, and we’re going to
58:57
get them all together in a great-big room, and give each of them responsibility to
59:06
map the old-growth forest on their forest.
59:10
And so, that’s what we did.
59:11
This was the one that was at the [Portland] Memorial Coliseum, correct?
59:14
Right.
59:15
Norm arranged this, rented it, and so we had this big room.
59:21
Each [National] forest and BLM district is laid out geographically, so that the
59:27
Willamette is right next to the Deschutes, is right next to the Umpqua, etc. So that
59:34
the people on one forest can see what the people on the other forest, how they are
59:40
mapping theirs, and they can coordinate, connect up their mapping on the forests.
59:48
And so, the four of us supervised that.
59:52
Each one of us took responsibility for a piece of it.
1:00:00
And I don’t know all of it, but you’ve got these four alphas
1:00:08
all in a room, actually, at least five, with Jim Sedell, and every
1:00:15
one of us sort of took a key responsibility and carried it forward.
1:00:23
It was incredible.
1:00:25
We had 130, 135, 140 people, for, I thought it was two weeks.
1:00:34
Norm says it’s only one week, but it sure seemed like two weeks to me.
1:00:37
And we did all the mapping and we did all
1:00:43
of the characterizing.
1:00:44
Norm, being the brilliant policy analyst that he is, said, “You
1:00:50
know, what we’re going to do here is we’re not going to give them a plan.
1:01:01
We’re going to analyze a whole broad range of alternatives and
1:01:02
we’re going to evaluate each from an environmental and from an economic
1:01:06
perspective, and we’re going to give that whole analysis to them.” And,
1:01:10
you know, Norm’s absolutely right.
1:01:12
That’s what you need to do in policy analysis.
1:01:15
You need to give the decision-makers a really broad array of alternatives
1:01:21
to look at, and some critical criteria for judging them by.
1:01:30
They were all designed, so that each one, you could look at the marginal cost
1:01:35
and benefit as you added each additional increment of preservation, for example.
1:01:43
It was an incredible exercise and Norm was the mastermind, and in the end,
1:01:51
we could put it all on a single chart.
1:01:55
So, six weeks later, we go back.
1:01:58
To Washington?
1:01:59
To Washington, D.C.
1:02:00
The same committees, correct?
1:02:01
Same committees.
1:02:03
Chief [U.S. Forest Service] was in the audience.
1:02:06
Dale Robertson?
1:02:07
With everybody else, and so, we make this presentation on what
1:02:15
we did and what we concluded.
1:02:16
Now, was this basically this report?
1:02:18
That’s this report.
1:02:19
Okay.
1:02:22
But, it’s all summarized on a single table.
1:02:27
And I don’t know if that’s in your copy or not, but it was amazing.
1:02:36
Now, the only thing in that copy that Norm said that was missing, was one of the
1:02:40
maps in the back that wasn’t in the copy.
1:02:42
He gave me the copy.
1:02:43
Well,
1:02:45
in any case, you know,
1:02:49
we went through
1:02:53
it.
1:02:53
Let’s see,
1:02:55
concluding observations.
1:02:57
The presentation of them was fascinating.
1:03:04
John Gordon was our spokesman, and John is a big man with a deep voice.
1:03:09
Or as people say, the “Voice of God,” right? He’s got that almost
1:03:13
James Earl Jones kind of presence.
1:03:16
Yes?
1:03:16
He does.
1:03:16
And so, Norm, I’m sure, will tell you about some of this because
1:03:23
John didn’t particularly agree with the report as we had written it at
1:03:27
that point, but he just went ahead and at the end of it, he said, okay,
1:03:34
one of the things, you know, we provided an array of alternatives.
1:03:39
Basically, what it showed them was there is no free lunch.
1:03:45
Jack
1:03:47
liked to talk about that all the time, that you cannot have five
1:03:51
billion board-feet of timber every year and have viable owl populations.
1:03:57
You have to make a choice.
1:03:59
You can’t do that.
1:04:00
And the range of alternatives, which went from deep green
1:04:03
to deep brown, showed that.
1:04:08
And this is what Gordon put in at the end.
1:04:12
So, we’ll describe the beginnings of a practical ecosystem approach
1:04:16
to conserving biological diversity.
1:04:19
Nature does things in twos and threes, rather than singly.
1:04:21
So should we, in seeking to preserve nature?
1:04:24
But here was the one I just couldn’t believe.
1:04:28
It seemed to be so quieting, the last thing.
1:04:32
“We have provided a sound basis for decisions given the time and information
1:04:36
limits within which we operated. Science, at least as exemplified by the
1:04:40
four of us and those who assisted us, has done what it can. The process of
1:04:45
democracy must go forward from here.”
1:04:51
[Laughs] They loved it.
1:04:52
They loved it.
1:04:52
Those politicians just loved this.
1:04:53
So,
1:04:59
the other people in this committee, that’s officially the Gang of Four,
1:05:02
were people from the Northwest.
1:05:05
How did John Gordon become added?
1:05:07
He was at Yale at the time, and he was kind of a more traditional
1:05:11
eastern establishment academic.
1:05:13
I mean, how did he get put into that and what did he bring to the table?
1:05:17
John, he’s the Dean at Yale.
1:05:20
Yale is, you know, the ultimate forestry school in a lot of people’s eyes.
1:05:28
At least in terms of legacy and history, yes.
1:05:32
[Henry] Graves was the first dean, etc.
1:05:34
And John was the nearest thing that we had to a statesman
1:05:42
in forestry.
1:05:44
He has this, he’s a great mind, and he also has this
1:05:51
presence which is very powerful.
1:05:55
And so, he was a natural choice.
1:05:58
One of the congressional staffers who put together the Gang of Four, was from Yale.
1:06:10
Jack
1:06:13
was the best-known forest wildlife biologist that we had.
1:06:17
He’s an elk specialist, but that didn’t make any difference.
1:06:21
I’m the old-growth guy, and Norm is the best policy person in the world and
1:06:27
knows allowable cuts inside and out.
1:06:30
He wrote the program.
1:06:33
And so, then we pulled Sedell and Reeves into it to deal with the fisheries issue.
1:06:42
And the interesting thing, and there’s a doctoral dissertation at UW on
1:06:46
this, is that those committees had decided to adopt us as their experts.
1:06:55
And they believed us and they were not going to question
1:06:58
anything that we told them.
1:06:59
And this is, of course, before we had this huge anti-intellectual,
1:07:06
anti-science thing, kind of take over the Republican Party.
1:07:10
Absolutely.
1:07:10
You still had Republicans that believed in science, for example?
1:07:13
Absolutely.
1:07:15
And so, when we made this report to them, and what we said in effect, is
1:07:23
that conserving old growth and spotted owls is going to cost you bigtime in
1:07:29
terms of impacts on allowable harvest.
1:07:33
And what was their initial response?
1:07:35
The initial response was sticker shock.
1:07:39
They believed everything we told them, but they couldn’t believe how much timber
1:07:44
harvest they were going to have to give up, to get any kind of a credible outcome.
1:07:49
Now, how many of these congress people were from the Northwest?
1:07:54
A lot of them.
1:07:55
And during the break,
1:08:00
we went down, and Bob Smith, who was from southwest Oregon, he was a southwest
1:08:06
Oregon congressman around, the one that
1:08:08
- Medford, Grants Pass, that area, or
1:08:10
--- ? Well, Eugene.
1:08:12
Oh, okay.
1:08:13
It’s the same one that
1:08:17
— DeFazio is now?
1:08:18
DeFazio.
1:08:18
Oh, so it’s his district, District 4?
1:08:20
The most important timber district in the United States.
1:08:27
He was looking at this chart
1:08:31
that laid out the alternatives, and what the economic costs and the
1:08:38
environmental benefits were going to be.
1:08:41
He was standing there looking at it like this, Norm and I walked up, and so Norm
1:08:46
said to him, “Well, Congressman, what do you think?
1:08:50
He said, “Well, we’re not going to legislate anything less than an eight.”
1:09:00
Less than an eight?
1:09:02
Man, that is going to reduce the allowable cut by 80 percent.
1:09:09
So, Norm said,
1:09:13
“Why?
1:09:15
Why nothing less than an eight?” And he said, “We are
1:09:18
not going to legislate anything
1:09:23
that has an “L” [One alternative from 14 alternatives considered that has
1:09:27
a low viability ranking regarding the ESA - from “Very Low” [1] to “Very High”
1:09:30
[14] probability in species viability]
1:09:31
. What do you mean by an L in it?
1:09:32
Well, in effect, what he was saying is, we’ve got these alternatives
1:09:37
laid out there, and they give us the probability of viable owl populations,
1:09:44
connected old-growth networks, fish habitat, marbled murrelet
1:09:50
habitat, other old-growth species.
1:09:53
And every one of them has a very qualitative grading on it.
1:10:01
The probability, if the probability is very low, VL, that means less
1:10:10
than a five percent probability of success in achieving that
1:10:15
goal over the next hundred years.
1:10:19
And so, we’d done that for all five of those things for this broad array,
1:10:24
actually, it went from about one to 14, it was about 14 alternatives that went from
1:10:30
“very brown” to “very green,” or “very
1:10:35
green” to “very brown.” And so, “very low,” “low,” “medium low,” “medium”
1:10:41
probability, 50 percent probability, that you would have it for a hundred years.
1:10:48
“Medium,” “medium high,” “high,” “very high,” a 95 percent or better probability.
1:10:57
And basically, what he’s saying is any alternative that has an L in it, which
1:11:05
was less than a 50 percent probability, wasn’t credible or acceptable as something
1:11:13
to put into a congressional bill.
1:11:17
The point here is that he looked at that chart and could immediately
1:11:22
identify the decision space he actually
1:11:29
had.
1:11:29
You know,
1:11:34
the decision space didn’t include just blowing off spotted owls and going for
1:11:38
five billion board-feet of timber, and that was part of a comprehensive policy
1:11:44
analysis, but it wasn’t going to happen.
1:11:49
And so, in the end, the congressional folks put together a
1:11:56
bill that was essentially equivalent to “Alternative 10” on a 14 or
1:12:03
12-point scale, something like that.
1:12:05
You’re talking about Alternative 10.
1:12:07
Green.
1:12:07
In the FEMAT report?
1:12:09
No.
1:12:10
Oh, Alternative 10 of that?
1:12:12
This is in the Gang of Four.
1:12:13
Okay, got you.
1:12:14
I just wanted to make sure.
1:12:15
They put together a bill.
1:12:16
It was even greener than eight, it was 10.
1:12:20
And it essentially involved reducing timber harvest by 80 percent.
1:12:30
But in the end, the Speaker of the House Representatives said, “I don’t want you
1:12:33
to vote this out of committee.” So, the three committees put a bill together
1:12:38
that they agreed on. The Speaker of the House said, “Don’t vote it on.
1:12:43
I don’t want it on the floor.”
1:12:45
And he tabled it.
1:12:46
They tabled it?
1:12:46
They tabled it.
1:12:46
Or did they kill it or they tabled it?
1:12:48
They tabled it.
1:12:48
Okay.
1:12:49
So, that was the end of the congressional effort.
1:12:52
But the Gang of Four report had dealt with fish and old-growth
1:13:00
and owls and murrelets, and a thousand other old-growth species.
1:13:06
So, it was the first time now we’re really looking at all elements in this system.
1:13:14
So, it was a critical step which started with an owl report, now
1:13:20
we have a scientific analysis that considers all the elements of
1:13:29
the system, and that was absolutely critical to positioning us for FEMAT.
1:13:38
Now, the owl report, I believe, was this one.
1:13:42
Correct?
1:13:43
[Viewing reports interviewer brought for reference.]
1:13:43
No, the owl report was—
1:13:46
Oh, this is 1985.
1:13:48
So this is early then?
1:13:49
Yeah, the 1991 one, the Thomas Committee.
1:13:51
Okay, I’m sorry, gotcha.
1:13:53
So, the Thomas Committee had given us the notion that to deal with owls, we
1:13:58
needed big reserves, we needed to worry about the areas between the big reserves.
1:14:03
The Gang of Four report really focused in on old growth and really focused
1:14:11
in on aquatic systems and fish.
1:14:15
So now, we have a really comprehensive background on which
1:14:21
to build a Northwest Forest Plan.
1:14:24
What was the peripheral noise or interactions between the timber
1:14:30
industry and even environmentalists as this was going on?
1:14:34
Because you already had, one of the injunctions was in effect, right?
1:14:40
The injunctions were in effect.
1:14:41
Right, I mean, Judge Dwyer made two decisions, correct?
1:14:45
Yeah.
1:14:45
And the second one was already having an impact, and was basically, a
1:14:48
test, and he said, “No, this stands.” And so, you were going forward.
1:14:51
But what was the push from the timber industry and the environmentalists?
1:14:54
Well, what they’d done with Dwyer, was at this point after this, they went back to
1:15:03
him essentially with the Thomas Report.
1:15:10
The ISC?
1:15:10
The ISC Report.
1:15:13
So, Dwyer read it and said, “Well, this is interesting, but this is old now.
1:15:24
We wrote this three or four years ago, and you said in the report there
1:15:29
might be new information, and there is. And you haven’t incorporated
1:15:34
that into your original document.
1:15:39
And incidentally, I’ve read the Gang of Four report, and what about the
1:15:43
old-growth forest?” So basically, the administration came to him with the
1:15:54
Thomas Report, which was really written in 1990, and he said, “Well, that’s good,
1:16:02
but it’s dated now.” So, he gives them a whole bunch of questions, “Now you take
1:16:08
this back, and you take my questions back, and you come back to me with a
1:16:13
response.” And that was the ISC Report.
1:16:19
And was that what is was called, “Scientific…it was
1:16:24
— Which one are we talking about now?
1:16:27
There’s another report.
1:16:29
I don’t think I have that one with me.
1:16:33
Do I have a copy of it upstairs?
1:16:35
Do you want to take a break just for a second?
1:16:39
I don’t think I have a copy of it.
1:16:42
But just speak to it, okay?
1:16:45
Basically, the Forest Service went back and put together a scientific
1:16:51
group, an internal scientific group, to respond to the judge’s questions.
1:16:56
In the meantime, before they got back to the judge with that, Bill
1:17:02
Clinton was elected president.
1:17:04
And he had said, “I’m going to solve this problem.”
1:17:09
That was one of his campaign promises?
1:17:11
That was one of his campaign promises.
1:17:14
And, if I recall, he
1:17:17
put together what became the “Forest Summit” within one or two
1:17:21
months after his inauguration.
1:17:23
Correct?
1:17:23
Absolutely.
1:17:23
He brought key members of his cabinet out.
1:17:26
And even before he did that, he set up a FEMAT
1:17:32
team.
1:17:32
The FEMAT team was to do a couple of things.
1:17:38
One was to review all
1:17:42
the science.
1:17:42
And the second thing that the FEMAT team was to do, was to develop a
1:17:47
series of alternatives that were scientifically credible and legally
1:17:52
possible within existing law, and basically consistent with those first
1:18:00
two goals, cut society some slack.
1:18:04
That
1:18:07
was the mission of the FEMAT team.
1:18:09
And it was very significant.
1:18:12
I don’t know if he knew this, but the goal of that group then was to
1:18:16
provide the alternatives from which the president would select a preferred
1:18:23
alternative, and all of which would be used as a basis for a NEPA-based process.
1:18:31
But this [FEMAT] was not a NEPA-based process.
1:18:33
This was a closed process.
1:18:37
Nobody got into the “pink tower.” Jack’s main job was to keep
1:18:44
everybody out of there and let the scientists work essentially freely
1:18:51
without pressures from outside.
1:18:53
For the record, the “pink tower” is
1:18:58
the U.S. Bank building, in downtown Portland. I believe they were on the
1:19:03
14th floor of a place affectionately called the pink tower, because
1:19:05
that’s where people almost lived for—
1:19:09
For three months.
1:19:10
— three months.
1:19:11
And so, talk about, I want you to go back.
1:19:17
Do you want to describe the Clinton Summit first, or the
1:19:20
dynamics of the pink tower first?
1:19:23
However you want to talk about that.
1:19:24
Well, I think the really important process that went on was not the
1:19:28
timber summit, it was what happened in
1:19:34
the pink tower.
1:19:35
The job of that team was to basically review all the science and to essentially
1:19:45
develop a series of alternatives that could be used in a NEPA-based EIS process.
1:19:56
That’s it.
1:20:02
So, when you were given the charge to do this, and it was the “Gang of
1:20:09
Four-Plus Two” that were basically the “co-managers,” correct?
1:20:16
The “Gang of Four” was ended with that report. So, John Gordon
1:20:21
wasn’t in this [FEMAT] process.
1:20:22
Right, correct.
1:20:24
It was mostly an agency-based process, but they pulled in a few academics.
1:20:31
Norm Johnson and I were two of the academics they pulled in.
1:20:36
Gordie Reeves, Jim Sedell are still involved, correct?
1:20:40
They are Forest Service
1:20:43
people.
1:20:44
Who were the main BLM players in the pink tower?
1:20:47
I couldn’t tell you.
1:20:48
Couldn’t tell you, okay.
1:20:50
I didn’t know the BLM people very well at that point-in-time.
1:20:54
But, Sedell
1:20:56
and Fred Swanson and Gordie Reeves were all there, and they were really
1:21:02
focused on developing the aquatic component of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:21:09
The owl people were there and were very much there developing
1:21:13
the owl component of it.
1:21:15
And they were very wedded to their HCA’s that they developed back in 1990.
1:21:22
And so, they wanted those to be the basis.
1:21:25
Conservation areas?
1:21:26
Habitat Conservation Areas.
1:21:27
Correct.
1:21:29
And, you know, I was very wedded to the old-growth concentrations
1:21:37
that we’d mapped and characterized in the Gang of Four report.
1:21:42
But essentially, we had all of that body of science behind us to work
1:21:52
from.
1:21:53
Now, what were the ground rules for this?
1:21:57
You were initially told you had sixty days, but then you
1:22:00
were given an extra thirty.
1:22:03
What did they say, come up with somebody, go camping out and come up with a
1:22:08
synthesis, or a document that we can then go produce enough viable alternatives for
1:22:14
the president to make a choice of one?
1:22:16
Is that how that came about?
1:22:18
Well,
1:22:20
there were a whole lot of evaluation processes that went on.
1:22:25
For example, each group of organisms had expert teams that came in and the
1:22:33
different alternatives were evaluated in terms of how well the experts in fungi and
1:22:40
insects and one thing or another thought they would work for their critters.
1:22:46
But
1:22:52
the way it broke down is you really had,
1:23:00
groups of people that were sort of working on their particular problem,
1:23:04
and there wasn’t a lot of effective interaction going on between them.
1:23:09
So, the aquatic people are doing their aquatic strategy, and they weren’t
1:23:13
aware of or paying much attention to what the old-growth people were doing,
1:23:18
or what the owl people were doing.
1:23:24
And also, they should have put Norm Johnson in charge of the alternative
1:23:29
development, and they didn’t.
1:23:31
So, the first seven alternatives were kind of a hodge-podge.
1:23:36
They weren’t beautiful, incremental kinds of blocks that built where
1:23:44
you could look at the marginal cost benefits beautifully, but you could
1:23:46
in the case of the Gang of Four.
1:23:46
They were
1:23:51
a hodgepodge of seven alternatives, and they were sort of everybody’s
1:23:55
things glued together, and so there was no real coordination between,
1:24:03
for example, terrestrial and aquatic.
1:24:05
What you might expect from such an intense, rushed and
1:24:10
polyglot type of effort.
1:24:12
Correct?
1:24:13
Absolutely.
1:24:14
And there wasn’t anyone really in charge.
1:24:18
Jack was really the outside man, the figurehead and one that was
1:24:24
dealing with the politics of this.
1:24:26
He was dealing with the White House.
1:24:28
He was dealing with interest groups.
1:24:31
He was dealing with the Native Americans.
1:24:34
His job was to try to keep all that crap away from the science
1:24:41
folks that were doing the work.
1:24:44
Because there were a lot of rules about who could even go on to the 14th floor.
1:24:48
Absolutely.
1:24:49
I mean, if you got permission and you weren’t one of the science people,
1:24:52
didn’t you have to almost wear like a fluorescent traffic vest or something?
1:24:57
Is that true?
1:24:57
That was the case in the Gang of Four.
1:25:02
Okay, that was the Gang of Four.
1:25:02
That was the Gang of Four.
1:25:02
The reason for that and the Gang of Four, was I had brought together all
1:25:07
of these staff specialists from the Forest Service the BLM and the Fish
1:25:14
and Wildlife Service, put them in a room together and said, “I want you
1:25:20
to map and characterize, good, better, best, the old growth on your forest.
1:25:29
That’s your job.” I didn’t want any decision-makers in there looking
1:25:35
over their shoulder, saying, “God damn it, don’t put anything there.
1:25:40
That’s our timber sale next year.” I wanted them to feel completely free of
1:25:48
pressure from decision-makers, rangers, supervisors, regional foresters,
1:25:54
and free of any pressure from enviros or timber interests.
1:25:59
The Gang of Four, we wanted them isolated, but particularly, we wanted them isolated
1:26:05
not just from the stakeholders, but from decision-makers in the agencies.
1:26:12
We didn’t want them to come in.
1:26:14
So that principal carried forward to FEMAT?
1:26:16
Absolutely.
1:26:18
I was the only one who ever brought in any of the decision-makers.
1:26:25
I did it after the first seven alternatives, as none
1:26:29
of them looked very good.
1:26:31
None of them did very well at producing timber because they were very inefficient.
1:26:37
They were everybody’s things piled on each other.
1:26:39
So, was this in the first sixty days, and then you realized
1:26:42
you needed thirty more days?
1:26:43
Is that why the thirty days got added on?
1:26:46
Absolutely.
1:26:46
We can do better than this.
1:26:47
We can do better than this, and the White House said, no, you can’t.
1:26:51
We want you to finish this.
1:26:53
And we had to really fight with the White House to get them to
1:26:58
let us have another thirty days.
1:27:00
And you know, this whole notion that the President was putting pressure on
1:27:04
us to provide an alternative that would produce more timber, was just bullshit.
1:27:10
They didn’t want us to take another thirty days at all.
1:27:13
But in the end, we did three more alternatives.
1:27:18
8, 9 and 10.
1:27:19
[Alternatives in FEMAT identified by Arabic numbers]
1:27:19
And—7, 8, 9 and 10, yeah.
1:27:25
Right.
1:27:26
And I was responsible for 9.
1:27:30
And my strategy was, okay, our problem here is we haven’t integrated the aquatic
1:27:38
and the terrestrial strategies, so we need to take some time and see how we
1:27:45
can make a more efficient reserve system.
1:27:48
Is that when the buffer zones started to become more malleable in terms
1:27:52
of how they first came up in the first sixty days, shall we say?
1:27:56
No, that’s totally different.
1:28:02
Okay.
1:28:03
No, this just had to do primarily with the reserves.
1:28:08
So I worked with Eric [Forsman] , I worked with Jim Sedell, I worked with Norm, and a
1:28:15
few others, but those were the key people.
1:28:20
Basically, we came up with a more efficient reserve system that
1:28:25
still got pretty good ratings in terms of how effective it was.
1:28:30
So, those then became 8, 9 and 10.
1:28:34
The White House picked 9 as the alternative, the preferred alternative.
1:28:42
Now mind you, the important thing here was the development of these alternatives, all
1:28:50
the scientific evaluation and development of alternatives, which had to be
1:28:55
scientifically credible and legal, because
1:29:02
NFMA requires that, and ESA requires that, as this was done outside
1:29:07
of any kind of public engagement.
1:29:11
And that’s unusual.
1:29:14
It was absolutely essential, because if you tried to do that in
1:29:18
a public forum, it would blow up.
1:29:25
Then they took FEMAT, which was roundly criticized -- oh man, everybody hated
1:29:32
it -- and used that as the basis then.
1:29:35
Both the left and the right?
1:29:36
Yes, absolutely.
1:29:37
There was a special issue from the Journal of Forestry on it.
1:29:41
And they couldn’t say enough bad things about it.
1:29:46
But it became the basis then, for the alternatives in the EIS.
1:29:54
And of course, we went out there, tens of thousands of comments came back, and
1:30:01
it underwent significant modification.
1:30:04
Alternative 9 became much greener, because the lawyers were concerned,
1:30:13
when they went back to Judge Dwyer, they wanted a slam-dunk.
1:30:17
They wanted to know he was going to find for going ahead.
1:30:22
And so,
1:30:26
basically, they revised Alternative 9, made it greener, and that became
1:30:32
the basis then for the final EIS.
1:30:35
Then, the Record of Decision came out of that?
1:30:41
Absolutely.
1:30:41
Now, one of the things that happened after FEMAT was handed off to the EIS, the
1:31:09
team that had been assembled went and did
1:31:32
other things.
1:31:32
Norm and I went back to our universities.
1:31:32
Jack became Chief of the Forest Service.
1:31:32
Basically, the central team disbursed.
1:31:32
And then, a new group of people responded to the comments and
1:31:32
determined implementation guidelines.
1:31:32
Let’s just say, they made some decisions in modifying Alternative 9, and in the
1:31:33
guidelines [See “survey and manage”] that made it difficult to achieve
1:31:34
some of the Forest Plan’s main goals.
1:31:35
So, in terms of came out in the final form of this, tell me about what was
1:31:42
good about Alternative 9, and how the modifications became problematic in terms
1:31:50
of this, and also, the implementation of the Forest Plan in reality?
1:31:55
I’ll give you two.
1:31:56
Okay.
1:31:59
The
1:32:01
first one is a fairly simple one.
1:32:04
In FEMAT, we decided to create these Adaptive Management Areas.
1:32:08
And incidentally, they were only in Alternative 9; they weren’t
1:32:12
in any other alternatives.
1:32:12
There no AMA’s in any of the others?
1:32:12
There were no AMA’s.
1:32:14
But Tom Spies had been saying, we keep telling these people they
1:32:19
can’t experiment, or they can’t implement a different strategy
1:32:24
until they experiment, and we don’t give them any place to experiment.
1:32:27
So, we need to do that.
1:32:30
So, we created these Adaptive Management Areas, ten of them,
1:32:35
each one designed to deal with some particular kind of issue or problem.
1:32:42
Well, the wildlife biologists, people that were concerned with
1:32:48
owls and concerned with murrelets,
1:32:52
really hated AMA’s.
1:32:53
They said, “All those are going to be is just woodsheds for the
1:32:59
local communities. We hate this.”
1:33:01
Basically, you’re “bribing” local people to like a plan or accept it.
1:33:06
Right?
1:33:06
Yeah, so we had made -- if you read FEMAT -- you’ll discover we tried to
1:33:13
make it as attractive as possible for people to do different kinds of things
1:33:18
in the Adaptive Management Areas.
1:33:21
In one example, we said you can begin to do things without having any
1:33:26
comprehensive plan for the AMA at all.
1:33:29
If you’ve got something you want to try, you don’t have to wait
1:33:32
around, just get right at it.
1:33:35
And we even asked for additional funding sources for it, funds for them.
1:33:42
Well,
1:33:45
when the team that followed FEMAT was asked, how should we change this?
1:33:55
They decided to make it very difficult to do anything in the AMA’s.
1:34:03
They wrote it so that before you can do anything in an AMA, you have
1:34:07
to have a very comprehensive plan for how you’re going to use it.
1:34:11
So, that is a major impediment.
1:34:15
Did that include “Survey and Management”?
1:34:18
[Extending NWFP mandate which focused on viability of a few species, like
1:34:19
the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, etc., to potentially
1:34:19
hundreds of species in a given area.]
1:34:19
Now, that’s the second issue.
1:34:20
Or, “Survey and Manage,” excuse me.
1:34:21
Survey and Manage [Policy name in NWFP] was the second one.
1:34:23
Right, so okay.
1:34:23
But the problem was, there were about 427 species or
1:34:32
species-groups, that there just simply wasn’t enough information to judge
1:34:36
whether or not the preserve system it would establish, which was 80 percent,
1:34:43
essentially, of the federal land-base, was adequate to cover those species.
1:34:48
So, it wasn’t that they were unknown, they were not adequately known.
1:34:56
So, what do you do if you don’t know whether or not your
1:35:00
reserve systems cover those?
1:35:02
Logic would say, oh, you make a commitment, we’re going to find out.
1:35:06
We’re going to go out and survey in the reserves, and
1:35:09
find out whether they’re there.
1:35:12
No, they didn’t do
1:35:15
that.
1:35:15
Norm thinks this was done by design.
1:35:19
What the biologists did was create the “Survey and Manage.” And it says, before
1:35:26
you can do anything in the Matrix, you have to survey for all of these species.
1:35:35
If you want to do anything, you have to survey for them, and if you find them,
1:35:40
you have to do something to protect them.
1:35:43
So, they became absolute trip wires.
1:35:49
First of all, it’s hugely expensive in time and money.
1:35:54
Some of these fungal things required four years of data.
1:36:01
So, Survey and Manage became essentially a mine field, as you
1:36:09
couldn’t really get anything done at all in the Matrix or in the AMA.
1:36:14
Now, Jack Ward Thomas, from what I’ve heard, had the strongest
1:36:20
terms for his disapproval of the Survey and Manage concept.
1:36:23
Correct?
1:36:23
Yes, and it was some of his own people that did
1:36:28
it.
1:36:28
To me, it’s the epitome of creating a dynamic of “paralysis through analysis.”
1:36:34
Well, it certainly does that.
1:36:38
The thing about the Northwest Forest Plan was, it was a “coarse
1:36:42
filter” approach. We’re going to set aside a lot of reserves.
1:36:46
And this was fine filter?
1:36:47
[Survey and Manage.]
1:36:47
This was fine filter.
1:36:49
And it created a
1:36:53
disastrous situation.
1:36:53
Especially because it was incorporated into something that was legally binding.
1:36:58
Yes.
1:37:00
The enviros used that to essentially prevent any significant activities
1:37:06
for about the first ten years.
1:37:07
They still use
1:37:15
it.
1:37:15
That would have likely not happened if the original team had been there to help write
1:37:19
the guidelines; if Jack had been there, if I’d been there, if Norm had been there.
1:37:22
If that decision was made, we’d have said, “Come on, people, if you don’t
1:37:26
know about these species, you have to go out in the reserves and go out and
1:37:31
see if they’re there.” [Implications: dramatically slowed down management]
1:37:32
Who funded the FEMAT process?
1:37:35
Where did that money come from?
1:37:39
Well, somewhere in the executive branch.
1:37:41
It was the executive, okay.
1:37:43
Yeah, I mean, it was President Clinton’s.
1:37:46
And basically, everybody had to go back to their lives and their
1:37:49
regular work, after that was done?
1:37:55
That’s right.
1:37:55
Wasn’t the original FEMAT team consulted?
1:37:58
[On
1:38:01
policy guidelines that went into Record of Decision, document
1:38:02
on how to implement NWFP]
1:38:02
. No.
1:38:02
And you guys had no idea this was going on until this [NWFP] came out?
1:38:06
That’s right.
1:38:07
What do you remember your first reaction was when you were reading this, and
1:38:11
started seeing, you said the two areas, but you were obviously probably picking
1:38:15
this apart, going, okay, interesting
1:38:18
- ? I was very disappointed, I mean, it was
1:38:22
-- Did you recognize the potential for
1:38:24
— Oh, absolutely.
1:38:24
— undermining the credibility and implementability of
1:38:30
the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:38:31
It was obvious, instantly.
1:38:33
That’s why Jack had the kind of reaction that he did, because at that
1:38:37
point-in-time he was Chief of the Forest Service, and now he was going to have
1:38:41
to live with this, which meant that not very much was going to get done.
1:38:48
And sure enough, it didn’t.
1:38:51
Wow!
1:38:51
Just hold on a second.
1:38:53
[Break in audio.]
1:38:53
Let’s go ahead and get started.
1:38:55
We took a short break.
1:38:57
Jerry is now looking through the actual 1995 Final Report [NWFP] , I believe,
1:39:02
sent to the Congress or to the President?
1:39:04
This was a Report to the President and the Congress.
1:39:06
And the Congress.
1:39:07
I was correct, okay.
1:39:14
They don’t really have — oh, it’s okay.
1:39:17
That’s pretty much a polished, abridged overview for fast reading,
1:39:23
that report there, if I recall.
1:39:24
I just wanted to reiterate the importance of the scientific efforts that led
1:39:34
up to the Northwest Forest Plan, and
1:39:40
particularly, the Thomas Committee’s report in 1990, and
1:39:44
Gang of Four [report] in 1991
1:39:48
that really looked at the whole northwestern ecosystem,
1:39:54
terrestrial and aquatic.
1:39:57
Those were really the basis for FEMAT in the development
1:40:02
of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:40:06
Without those previous analytic efforts, I don’t think we’d have done nearly as well
1:40:13
as we did in the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:40:16
Now, how much did the idea of the scientific pulse affect you in your
1:40:22
original idea to come together with the first “cram session” that was at
1:40:29
the Memorial Coliseum in Portland?
1:40:32
Was this kind of modeled on that idea, where you had the science pulses
1:40:35
where you’d go out and bring people together for one or two weeks, and
1:40:38
you’d go into the field, whether it was the Sequoias or Rocky Mountains?
1:40:41
Was this kind of the same idea?
1:40:43
No, it really wasn’t.
1:40:46
I see where it has a resemblance.
1:40:53
The main impetus to do the first pulses had to do with team-building,
1:41:01
and the fact I was leading a large group of people at Corvallis, Forest
1:41:06
Service and academic, and I was the only one that knew all of them.
1:41:13
I wanted them to get to know each other better, and that’s where the idea came.
1:41:19
And it seemed like, let’s take everybody someplace we haven’t been before, and
1:41:28
camp out and do field studies together, and then share every evening over a
1:41:36
campfire what we’ve seen that day.
1:41:39
And it worked.
1:41:40
It did build much more of a team, a much more integrated group.
1:41:48
But no, it does have the resemblance that when I thought about, how are we going to
1:41:57
respond to this congressional direction to map and characterize the old growth,
1:42:08
how can I do that?
1:42:09
And the only way I could do that was to get a large group of people
1:42:13
who had been spending their entire lives out there on the ground, and
1:42:19
they really knew their systems.
1:42:24
Bringing all that expertise, all that staff expertise together with their
1:42:29
maps and ortho-photos, and more than anything, their personal knowledge
1:42:35
of the ground, was the way to do it.
1:42:37
In terms of this method of bringing people together, the two instances, the
1:42:41
Gang of Four and then later, the larger one, the FEMAT, has that been used
1:42:46
as a model again in larger or smaller
1:42:51
sizes, here in the United States or even in other countries?
1:42:56
I don’t really know, to tell you the truth.
1:43:00
We used it in California.
1:43:05
We went from doing FEMAT in the Northwest Forest Plan to SNEP, the Sierra Nevada
1:43:14
Ecosystem Project, which was funded by the Forest Service, but operated actually
1:43:21
through the University of California at
1:43:23
Davis.
1:43:25
Norm was involved in that and I was involved in that, and my responsibility
1:43:30
again was the old forests of the Sierra Nevada, and assessing them.
1:43:37
And again, the way I did that was to bring together a large body, it
1:43:46
could have been as many as 150 people.
1:43:49
Was this in the ‘90s or 2000’s?
1:43:52
This would have been in the ‘90s.
1:43:56
This would have been about ’95.
1:44:01
And again, I brought them together in
1:44:07
a hotel in Sacramento for a week.
1:44:11
And again, just bringing together, not decision-makers, but staff, the
1:44:18
experts on various areas of wildlife, of hydrology, of fisheries, or forests.
1:44:28
And we spent a week working in a very
1:44:38
large conference room in this hotel.
1:44:41
And interestingly, after that one,
1:44:46
people came to me and they said thank you for treating us like professionals.
1:44:55
The science people?
1:44:56
These staff people from the [national] forests and the [national] parks and the
1:45:02
BLM districts came to me, and basically, they were asked to do a professional
1:45:10
task and given the freedom to do it.
1:45:15
And in both cases, they were really grateful for that.
1:45:21
Why do you think they had such gratitude based on their experience
1:45:25
before, in your opinion, and why they would have that reaction?
1:45:28
They didn’t feel people were really paying attention to them and their knowledge.
1:45:34
They didn’t think their knowledge and their capacities
1:45:36
were being fully-utilized.
1:45:38
They were being constrained by agency missions.
1:45:43
Now, do you think that was also true with the people that were involved
1:45:46
with the Northwest Forest Plan?
1:45:48
Yes.
1:45:48
So, they found, shall we say, a new form of professional self-esteem?
1:45:53
They did.
1:45:54
Through that process?
1:45:55
It was stressful for them, however, because
1:46:01
I remember one of them, a really, wonderful person.
1:46:05
She
1:46:08
was really stressed by the fact that she was being asked to tell me where
1:46:13
the good old growth was on her forest.
1:46:17
And
1:46:21
she had been working with these people over the years to try to
1:46:25
develop a credible timber program.
1:46:30
She understood the tension between “tell me about the resource,” even
1:46:39
though it maybe was going to have an impact on your timber program,
1:46:44
and she talked to me about it.
1:46:47
I said, “Just remember, in this exercise, your clients are the owls
1:46:54
and the fish and the trees, and that’s all you need to worry about.” And
1:47:01
you know, they did a wonderful job.
1:47:04
Both exercises -- they did wonderful jobs.
1:47:07
Now, what was the dynamic between the BLM and the Forest Service before
1:47:14
the Northwest Forest Plan process?
1:47:16
You can include the whole continuum of events.
1:47:19
And what do you think that the process of collaboration, grudgingly or
1:47:24
otherwise, did for the relationship and the dynamics between the two agencies?
1:47:30
Well, for a while,
1:47:34
it worked.
1:47:35
You know, Clinton said, “You’re going to all work together.
1:47:40
And BLM, you’re going to be in the same soup with the Forest Service.”
1:47:45
So, the agencies really did come together and work as a unit,
1:47:54
but that gradually was eroded afterwards as each went its own way.
1:48:01
Back to their normal modus operandi.
1:48:05
Before moving back to their modus operandi.
1:48:08
And
1:48:10
so, you know, they are very different cultures.
1:48:16
How would you describe the cultures?
1:48:19
Well, the BLM in the State of Oregon, has had this mission
1:48:24
of managing the O&C lands.
1:48:26
It has this congressional mandate for generating income.
1:48:31
And so,
1:48:34
they have always been very aggressive, not necessarily insensitive, but
1:48:42
very aggressive about implementing their [logging] programs.
1:48:48
They knew what they had to do.
1:48:51
So, it was a real challenge, and it was a bigger challenge for them than it was
1:48:54
for the Forest Service, because they had this strongly conflicting mission.
1:49:02
And there’s always been objections that they shouldn’t have been subjected to the
1:49:07
same plan that the Forest Service was, because they had this different mission.
1:49:12
[As set by federal legislation] But the reality is that both agencies on
1:49:17
both properties have the same laws that they’re having to deal with.
1:49:27
They’re both subject to the Endangered Species Act, and
1:49:29
they’re both subject to NEPA.
1:49:31
So,
1:49:40
in many ways, but interestingly, the BLM now has become the
1:49:43
more innovative organization.
1:49:50
Perhaps a part of that was because they have
1:49:56
these two missions that conflict with each other, and so they’re really challenged,
1:50:03
whereas the Forest Service isn’t challenged on the economic side at all.
1:50:08
So, they can be very conservative and laid-back, and try to
1:50:17
avoid making any kind of waves.
1:50:19
Well, there’s been more activity on the BLM lands in the last 15-20 years.
1:50:25
Absolutely.
1:50:25
There’s been much more creativity.
1:50:27
How the hell do we integrate these things?
1:50:31
How do we meet our environmental obligations and still meet, to at
1:50:36
least some degree, our economic obligations to the counties?
1:50:43
So, the Forest Service, because it has no clear economic
1:50:56
mandate—there’s nothing in the National Forest Management Act of
1:51:01
’76 that says you have to cut a lot of timber, or cut any timber at all.
1:51:09
And so, basically,
1:51:14
it’s very easy for the agency to take a very soft approach.
1:51:19
Well, you can interpret multiple-use, which is still a paradigm, but you can
1:51:23
interpret that in markedly different ways.
1:51:26
Well, you can, but like the way it’s worked out, the National Forest
1:51:34
Management Act, does mandate that you provide for biological diversity.
1:51:41
It does not mandate that you cut a certain amount of timber.
1:51:48
Well, the expressive statements would have been addressing modus
1:51:54
operandi and practices as it had been for 71 years up to that point.
1:51:59
Yeah.
1:52:02
What about the State of Oregon and the State of Washington, and you could
1:52:05
even say California, in terms of their lands and the interface, economically,
1:52:12
ecologically, hydrologically, and all these continuums that work together?
1:52:17
These are artificial boundaries around malleable ecologies
1:52:23
which are completely different.
1:52:24
Sure.
1:52:24
I mean, what do you remember about the states of Oregon and Washington,
1:52:27
and even going forward, how they’re dealt with this, and how the
1:52:31
interlocking parts fit together?
1:52:33
Well, interestingly, I think the comparison really, is
1:52:40
between Washington and Oregon.
1:52:43
Tell me the differences.
1:52:44
I know you’ve spoken a lot on this before, but I’m interested in your
1:52:48
take and how the two states, the cultures, differentiate, and how this
1:52:53
played out even before the Northwest Forest Plan, but especially since?
1:52:58
Well, among other things, the timber industry has always been more powerful
1:53:04
in the State of Oregon than in the State of Washington, at least in my lifetime.
1:53:12
Washington has always been, I don’t know if we’d call it a more progressive
1:53:19
state, it’s been certainly much more oriented towards growth, and it’s been
1:53:25
more oriented towards industry, towards
1:53:33
business.
1:53:35
But you might think it, you know, the environment would not do so well here.
1:53:43
But the interesting thing is, take a look at where the national parks are.
1:53:49
And Washington has three large national parks.
1:53:55
Oregon has one.
1:53:57
[Crater Lake]
1:53:59
A small one.
1:54:00
Relatively small one.
1:54:00
And so, in many interesting ways, because the timber industry
1:54:05
is structured different in the State of Washington and because
1:54:13
the population has been less dependent on the wood products
1:54:22
industry, the Northwest Forest Plan has not had nearly the same
1:54:25
impact in Washington as in Oregon.
1:54:28
And in many ways,
1:54:34
Washington is much more conservation-oriented insofar as
1:54:38
its public lands are concerned.
1:54:40
The state lands.
1:54:41
The state is.
1:54:45
Very simply, just look at the fact we’ve got three big national parks.
1:54:50
Oregon has always prided itself on being environmental, and I’m an
1:54:55
Oregonian and I was born in Oregon.
1:54:58
But interestingly, they’ve never let that interfere in any way
1:55:04
with cutting Douglas-fir trees.
1:55:06
Okay?
1:55:07
And you see the fact that there’s no significant preserve that’s
1:55:14
been created, based on state initiatives in the State of Oregon.
1:55:17
And I believe you can go on
1:55:20
down to the Willamette Valley or to the Coast Range where a lot
1:55:24
of the state lands are in various forms, and you still see massive
1:55:28
clear-cuts going on up to right now.
1:55:31
Oh, yes, you do.
1:55:31
And in fact, forest practices in Oregon are much behind where they are in
1:55:37
the State of Washington, particularly where riparian protection is concerned.
1:55:41
And you get another reflection of the difference in the
1:55:44
attitude of the population.
1:55:47
Now, the other
1:55:50
reason for this is that the structure of the industry has always been
1:55:54
very different in the two states.
1:55:56
In Washington, you know, it was primarily three large land owners.
1:56:02
Weyerhaeuser?
1:56:02
Weyerhaeuser,
1:56:05
Northern Pacific, which became Plum Creek Timber Company, and Boise-Cascade.
1:56:11
And so, this has been the core of the industry, and they own their own lands.
1:56:17
So, they’ve never been particularly dependent, any of
1:56:20
them, on public lands at all.
1:56:22
And you’ve had a lot more smaller operators in Oregon.
1:56:25
Yeah.
1:56:25
I mean, still large, some of them.
1:56:26
In Oregon, you had a lot of medium-sized companies that are family owned.
1:56:33
Like Rosboro in Springfield.
1:56:36
Seneca.
1:56:37
Yes, the Jones family [Seneca, in Eugene] , right.
1:56:40
Hampton.
1:56:40
Yeah, all of it.
1:56:43
So, there’s always
1:56:48
publicly-held corporations like Weyerhaeuser, that understand
1:56:52
they operate in a larger social context, and they adjust, adapt.
1:57:00
Medium-sized, family-owned companies don’t necessarily do that.
1:57:04
And so, the whole battle in Oregon has been much more ideological, and
1:57:10
the industry has much more power in the State of Oregon than it
1:57:14
does in the State of Washington.
1:57:15
That’s why credible restrictions on management in private forest lands has
1:57:23
never happened in the State of Oregon.
1:57:24
It has happened in the State Washington.
1:57:28
So, in other words, a large, private landowner that is interfacing with some
1:57:32
key watershed, let’s say, the Willamette or the McKenzie or the Santiam or
1:57:36
what have you, and let’s say, whatever they do on private lands is going to
1:57:41
affect watersheds and other things.
1:57:43
Amen.
1:57:44
They just go, too bad or
1:57:46
- ? Too bad, it’s private land.
1:57:48
It’s my land and I’m doing good forestry, you know, I’m
1:57:55
replanting.
1:57:56
Sometime if you get a chance, visit the Siletz River basin.
1:58:01
You can see it’s pretty much like a bomb’s been dropped on it.
1:58:04
That’s basically where the Toledo mill [upriver from Newport on Yaquina River]
1:58:07
was fed from back all those years.
1:58:09
Correct?
1:58:09
Well, yeah, in part.
1:58:10
Yeah, yeah.
1:58:13
And so, the attitudes in these two states are very different,
1:58:18
particularly towards the public lands.
1:58:21
It’s interesting.
1:58:21
That’s a real conflict with perception, even with me, an Oregon kid who’s
1:58:26
from Eugene and he’s back there again, you know, land of the Grateful Dead,
1:58:31
“green” people and hippies, and even straight politicians like Tom McCall,
1:58:36
a Republican, who oversaw these state level progressive environmental laws.
1:58:42
It goes against perception.
1:58:43
That’s right, and they’ve never been able to pass, for example,
1:58:47
restrictions on clear-cuts.
1:58:50
Even with a Democratic-controlled Senate and House for many, many years?
1:58:56
Never happen.
1:58:57
You haven’t had a Republican-controlled Oregon State Senate or House of
1:59:03
Representatives for a long time.
1:59:05
That’s right.
1:59:06
So, that’s really interesting how you see the difference between that.
1:59:10
Now, how much of the FEMAT report did you actually write?
1:59:14
I don’t know.
1:59:15
But you were involved with the writing?
1:59:17
I certainly was, and particularly, Alternative 9, and
1:59:24
other aspects of it related to the old growth.
1:59:28
So, but that’s also fuzzy in my mind.
1:59:32
If you were going to look back on this, the FEMAT report, let’s go back, but
1:59:36
without going into the things that were added into this that became problematic.
1:59:43
If you were going to break out the six areas; terrestrial ecology,
1:59:46
aquatic watersheds, resource analysis, economic investment, social assessment
1:59:50
and spatial analysis, how would you characterize the strengths and weaknesses
1:59:54
of the product that came out of that?
1:59:57
What was the best part of it, and what part do you think even within
2:00:00
Alternative 9 that could have been better?
2:00:04
Either at the time, or in retrospect.
2:00:07
Well, it’s pretty clear to me that there should have been a lot more
2:00:11
emphasis on active management.
2:00:14
We did a great job of stopping activity, but we didn’t do a great
2:00:19
job of identifying where aggressive active management was needed.
2:00:26
We allowed for it.
2:00:29
Think about the east side forest within the range of the
2:00:35
owl.
2:00:35
Basically, east of the crest.
2:00:36
[Cascades Mountains]
2:00:36
East of the crest.
2:00:37
And we basically wrote into the plan, that it was okay to manage
2:00:46
those to restore historic conditions.
2:00:49
Nobody did it.
2:00:52
But
2:00:55
we needed more.
2:00:55
We needed to do more
2:01:02
and say what needs to be done in terms of active management.
2:01:07
So, we should have said something pretty profound about that.
2:01:12
We should have said something very much stronger about salvage [logging]
2:01:16
. In other words, it wouldn’t have allowed some of the provisions that
2:01:20
were in here, but also other things to kind of paralyze even the intentions.
2:01:26
Correct.
2:01:26
In other words, the vacuum that was created and the economic activity dynamic
2:01:31
which was never going to be what it was, but it really should have been better.
2:01:36
Yeah.
2:01:36
Is that what you’re trying to speak to?
2:01:37
Yeah.
2:01:38
Okay.
2:01:39
And the riparian.
2:01:41
You know, what we did was we did interim riparian buffers.
2:01:46
We said, then you do watershed analysis and you can change those buffers.
2:01:51
Well, we said you could do that, but nobody did it.
2:01:55
We should have said, “You will!”
2:02:01
Somehow, we should have provided a much more active force than we did
2:02:08
in terms of what should be done out there, what should you stop doing,
2:02:13
and what should you start doing.
2:02:15
Although, in retrospect, at the same time, it’s still rather remarkable what
2:02:20
was done in a short period of time.
2:02:21
Oh.
2:02:22
I mean, it’s easy to in hindsight, say, well, we should have, could have….
2:02:25
Of course.
2:02:26
I mean, obviously.
2:02:28
Of course, absolutely right.
2:02:30
And another thing was that we didn’t realize, being naïve scientists, was that
2:02:37
you can allow all the latitude you want for adaptation, but that doesn’t mean
2:02:43
anyone is going to take advantage of it.
2:02:45
So, we wrote a plan that had all kinds of opportunities
2:02:49
for people to change the plan.
2:02:55
None of the stakeholders wanted that.
2:02:57
None of the lawyers wanted that.
2:02:59
None of the agencies wanted that.
2:03:03
They wanted a static thing that was like a rock.
2:03:07
This is it.
2:03:07
I don’t want any uncertainty about it.
2:03:10
And adaptation is all about uncertainty, change.
2:03:15
And nature is a moving target.
2:03:16
Yes, it is.
2:03:17
Just like humanity, right?
2:03:19
Yeah.
2:03:20
So, now, do you—oh, okay.
2:03:24
One other thing that we missed completely,
2:03:28
was the fact that the greatest amount, the richest stage of forest development
2:03:36
in our region, is the period after a disturbance and before a canopy closes.
2:03:43
So, it’s the early successional ecosystems.
2:03:47
They are hugely more biodiverse than any of the closed canopy forest stages.
2:03:54
None of us were thinking about that.
2:03:56
So that wasn’t addressed?
2:03:58
That’s not addressed at all.
2:04:09
And whether you want to stick to your specialty in old-growth, late-
2:04:13
successional forests, how have you been involved since the plan?
2:04:17
[NWFP] There’s obviously teams of people who are doing the monitoring
2:04:21
on the ground, but what has been your involvement, and how have you either
2:04:25
guided or watched or counseled the process of monitoring after-the-fact?
2:04:31
Well, I’ve evolved hugely in terms of my own thinking about it.
2:04:36
And I had focused on old growth, but I’ve enlarged my view to the
2:04:44
entire ecosystem, from start to finish, and not just the old.
2:04:50
So, I have a very holistic view.
2:04:51
You need the whole successional sequence, I say.
2:04:57
I had no involvement actually in implementing the plan [NWFP] . And
2:05:02
Norm and I have not really been involved with the plan for probably a
2:05:08
decade or more following it’s signing.
2:05:11
We became involved as a result of the controversy over the O&C Lands [s] , and
2:05:22
the politicians involved us in that.
2:05:24
And so,
2:05:28
that’s how we’ve returned to an engagement with federal forest policy, the Northwest
2:05:35
Forest Plan and its implementation.
2:05:37
Why don’t you describe that process and how your reinvolvement started, and
2:05:41
give me a sketch of how that’s occurred?
2:05:46
Well, it’s a long story, but I’ll make it short, and simply say that
2:05:54
politicians
2:05:59
in Congress
2:06:02
particularly, but also in the White House, once Obama was elected, were really
2:06:09
interested in thinking about alternative approaches to management of the O&C Lands
2:06:18
that would
2:06:22
achieve both ecological and economic objectives.
2:06:25
It sort of started with both Senator [Ron] Wyden [D-Oregon] and House
2:06:34
people wanting to write legislation that would protect old growth,
2:06:41
increase activities to improve the health of the forest, and provide additional
2:06:48
timber over what’s happening now.
2:06:51
It would solve some of the
2:06:55
constipation of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:06:59
And so, about 10 years ago, that’s how we began to get involved advising the
2:07:06
congressional folks on what to put into a bill that would try to do those things.
2:07:16
That evolved to proposing some kind of a partial cutting on some of this land,
2:07:24
and showing what that would look like.
2:07:26
So, would you come down and mark an area and show people, asked Congressman [Peter]
2:07:33
DeFazio [D-Oregon] asked us to do that.
2:07:37
Then [Interior] Secretary [Ken]
2:07:42
Salazar, six years ago or so, got involved in trying to - What happened was, in the
2:07:52
younger Bush [George W.] administration, BLM had developed a new plan, a
2:07:56
revised plan called WOPR [pronounced Whopper], Western Oregon Plan Revision.
2:08:06
It was going to start cutting old growth and things, and they
2:08:11
sort of did that right at the end of the younger Bush’s two terms.
2:08:18
When it was challenged and Obama was in, he said, “No, we’re not going to do that.
2:08:25
We’re not going to do WOPR.” But they had to come up with some initiative in terms
2:08:31
of, well, okay, what are you going to do?
2:08:32
And so that was when Secretary Salazar got involved, and he
2:08:38
invited Norm and I to get involved.
2:08:40
He asked us to go down there and actually work with BLM in developing some pilot
2:08:46
projects to demonstrate our alternatives.
2:08:51
So, that really began to get us involved in BLM’s plan revision,
2:08:58
if not a larger plan revision.
2:09:01
And Norm and I decided that we’ve got to put down our whole idea here,
2:09:07
we’ve got to have a comprehensive view of how to revise Northwest Forest
2:09:13
activities, federal forest activities.
2:09:17
If we just give congressional people the pieces or the Secretary
2:09:22
of Interior pieces, they can choose whatever they want.
2:09:27
So, we decided we had to produce a comprehensive report on what
2:09:32
we think, a total strategy.
2:09:34
So we did a report, we abstracted it, and published it in the Journal of
2:09:39
Forestry, on what we think would be an appropriate strategy for management
2:09:47
of federal forest lands going forward.
2:09:50
We published that in the Journal of Forestry.
2:09:52
So, that got us totally engaged in this activity.
2:10:00
But
2:10:03
to a fair degree, now, we’re closed out again.
2:10:08
The BLM developed a revised plan which they have adopted, the
2:10:15
administration has approved, and they are moving forward on, but which
2:10:19
is going to be challenged in court.
2:10:22
And, a lot of our thoughts were in that plan.
2:10:28
They didn’t do exactly what we said, but took a lot of pieces
2:10:33
of our work, and used it.
2:10:34
The Forest Service hasn’t really engaged us
2:10:41
at all.
2:10:41
You mean in terms of, let’s say, revitalizing the stagnancies
2:10:46
of the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:10:47
No, I mean, we’ve not been engaged in any official way with the Forest
2:10:54
Service in its consideration of revising the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:11:00
What can you see, other than some things we’ve talked about, now that we’ve seen
2:11:06
some of the problems, especially on the economic side, what could be added
2:11:11
or augmented that would make it, shall we say, a more effective plan-document
2:11:18
moving forward, the Northwest Forest Plan?
2:11:20
Well, our Journal of Forest article lays out what we think,
2:11:25
but it’s really very simple.
2:11:28
First of all, you’ve got to distinguish the moist forest from the dry forest.
2:11:33
That is, frequent fire forests effectively from the canopy fire forest.
2:11:38
And that was not really addressed?
2:11:40
[In NWFP]
2:11:40
It was not.
2:11:41
It was focused on the moist forest?
2:11:43
It was focused on the moist forest.
2:11:45
Right.
2:11:45
We acknowledged the dry, but we didn’t do a damn thing really,
2:11:48
because we were tired and didn’t have the knowledge to deal with it.
2:11:52
So,
2:11:54
in the moist forest, just for the time being, for the foreseeable
2:12:01
future, just take the mature and old forests off the table,
2:12:07
manage some of the plantations to restore old-growth conditions, but
2:12:12
begin to do regeneration harvests in some of the older plantations, and
2:12:19
with one of the goals being creation of early successional ecosystems.
2:12:24
Very simple.
2:12:30
Basically, manage forests that you’ve already harvested, and leave the ones
2:12:36
that haven’t been cut before, alone.
2:12:42
Whatever you do, make sure it has an ecological content as
2:12:46
well as an economic content.
2:12:50
On the east side, very simply, basically restore as much of it as you can
2:12:55
possibly get done before it burns out.
2:13:01
We produced a manual on our ideas about how you do that, and
2:13:11
we’ve laid out a pretty comprehensive vision, and it's relatively simple.
2:13:18
But it remains to be seen, you know, how much of it, if any, the
2:13:23
Forest Service is going to pick up.
2:13:26
I am astounded that it seems to just be outside of their
2:13:36
bandwidth to think about doing regeneration harvests in plantations.
2:13:45
Now, why wouldn’t you do that at this point-in-time?
2:13:50
But they’ve got all kinds of reasons why they don’t want to do this.
2:13:58
So, all they do is thin.
2:14:01
What would you say about the evolution of environmentalists in relation
2:14:06
to this subject, forestry in the Pacific Northwest, their original
2:14:12
role, how they’ve evolved, and their role positively, but also negatively?
2:14:23
Well, we have some organizations and some individuals who simply do not
2:14:28
want any timber harvest on the federal lands, and they will use any device to
2:14:35
try to achieve that goal, fair or foul.
2:14:42
So that’s a problem.
2:14:43
But the large national environmental organizations are pretty much
2:14:49
on board with the kind of approach that we are suggesting.
2:14:53
It’s pretty much what was in Wyden’s bill.
2:14:56
So, in other words, the Oregon Wilds of the world are the ones
2:15:00
that are putting the hammer down, no matter what everywhere?
2:15:03
Actually, no.
2:15:04
No?
2:15:05
They aren’t.
2:15:05
Oh, I stand corrected.
2:15:11
They aren’t.
2:15:14
They have a level of reasonability with them.
2:15:18
But there are a number of very small, grassroots kinds of organizations
2:15:23
who absolutely are opposed.
2:15:26
But Oregon Wild isn’t that intense.
2:15:30
And they have become moderately reasonable, particularly when it
2:15:36
comes to restoring dry forests.
2:15:40
And they probably would find it perfectly acceptable to do regeneration
2:15:44
harvest in plantations if the Forest Service was to propose such a thing.
2:15:51
Now, what do you say to the timber communities that have been decimated
2:15:56
by many factors, globalization, technology, the whole dynamic of
2:16:04
what the good-old days were, and whatever has happened since then.
2:16:10
What do you say to those people, who certainly have a perception, and as
2:16:15
we’re dealing with a new presidential dynamic that seems to me to be a
2:16:21
tsunami wave of harsh reactionary sentiments, including, you know,
2:16:27
the people from those communities.
2:16:29
What would you say to them?
2:16:32
I would say to them,
2:16:36
I agree with you that the federal lands should be providing more
2:16:43
in the way of economic return.
2:16:47
And that this could be done, and in ways that are ecologically sound.
2:16:58
Basically, I view those people as some of our most important potential
2:17:07
advocates for public lands in the future.
2:17:14
We’ve found, when we were doing this work in southwest Oregon, that
2:17:21
most of the people, the ordinary people we talked to, don’t like this
2:17:26
intense management that’s going on.
2:17:29
They don’t like that, but they also don’t feel that all the
2:17:34
federal lands should be reserves.
2:17:40
Norm and I agree that they shouldn’t be.
2:17:43
There should be a greater flow of timber.
2:17:45
It would be good for both the forests and the communities if there were.
2:17:53
So, when you meet with them, or if you do in whatever setting, what do you
2:17:56
tell them, or what do they tell you?
2:18:01
Well
2:18:04
— Because in the Northwest Forest Plan, the bureaucrats, the
2:18:07
environmentalists, are easy targets.
2:18:11
That’s usually what you hear from people, at least when they’re in an angry moment.
2:18:14
Sure.
2:18:14
But when you’re having a reasonable moment, you or Norm is talking,
2:18:17
whomever, what do those conversations go like, and what would you say
2:18:21
to them if you had a calm forum where you could really communicate?
2:18:26
Well, I’d say to them, we should be doing more management on our national forests.
2:18:33
And it should be focused primarily on previously harvested lands.
2:18:36
And if
2:18:39
we did that, we could provide you with probably two to three times the amount of
2:18:46
timber that you’re taking off currently.
2:18:49
Now, realistically in terms of the smaller and medium-sized mills, which a
2:18:55
lot of them are shut down, or they have to retrofit their operations for smaller
2:19:01
logs or what have you, or forest products broadly-conceived, if something was
2:19:07
achieved where there was more material, that’s a real crude term, but what would
2:19:14
be the possibility of bringing back something in a smaller, more restrained
2:19:21
way than in the good-old boom days?
2:19:24
Total possibility.
2:19:25
It is?
2:19:26
Absolutely.
2:19:27
Yeah, for example, I took my students to a mill in Skamania
2:19:33
County down on the Columbia River.
2:19:37
And their biggest problem is logs.
2:19:42
If they had more logs, they could sell products and could increase,
2:19:50
for example, the number of shifts that they are operating their mills.
2:19:56
So,
2:19:58
the capacity is there.
2:20:05
We’re almost done, Jerry.
2:20:07
What have been the forest health dynamics over the twenty years of the Northwest
2:20:11
Forest Plan that you can measure?
2:20:14
I mean, you’ve had studies on how much less or more there is, vis-à-vis
2:20:19
models and projections, you have the owl and all those things, but how would
2:20:22
you characterize the NWFP at twenty years, if you were going to give it a
2:20:26
progress report or a synopsis statement?
2:20:30
Well, in the moist forest, it’s really gotten better.
2:20:34
We stopped cutting and things are growing back.
2:20:38
All you’ve got to do is go to the Andrews and take a look at that
2:20:44
landscape.
2:20:46
But things have gotten much worse in the dry forest.
2:20:54
It’s a tremendous contrast.
2:20:56
I’m going to be talking on Thursday to a group in Portland, and one of
2:21:02
the things I’m going to tell them, is that the Douglas-fir/Hemlock
2:21:06
region is probably the most
2:21:12
vulnerable major forest region in the world to climate
2:21:17
change and invasive species.
2:21:21
There’s a tendency to think that these forests don’t
2:21:24
have to worry about anything.
2:21:26
It’s moist and they're productive.
2:21:28
But they’re very vulnerable.
2:21:34
How did we get on that?
2:21:36
I guess you asked about the health of the forest.
2:21:39
No, I asked you to give me a twenty-year report card, if you will.
2:21:44
Things have gotten better on federal land over the last twenty years.
2:21:53
Things have gotten much worse on private lands over the last twenty years.
2:21:59
The way that private, the way that management on the TIMOs and REITs has
2:22:04
moved has been extremely destructive.
2:22:07
[Timber Investment Management Organizations and Real Estate Investment
2:22:09
Trusts] On the dry forest, things on all lands are worse than they
2:22:16
were before because we’ve just built up, created more and more fuels.
2:22:21
In other words, the paralysis dynamics we’ve been talking about
2:22:24
have helped create a tinder box?
2:22:27
Absolutely, and we have by no means begun to make a dent in that.
2:22:34
But I will say that in the last decade or so, we have gotten
2:22:40
more momentum on the east side.
2:22:44
We are doing more.
2:22:45
Now, when you’re talking about the east side, you’re talking about the
2:22:47
Cascade Crest, not eastern Oregon.
2:22:50
Yeah, the dry forest, the pine.
2:22:51
You’re talking about eastern Oregon, too, the Blues and what not?
2:22:54
You know,
2:22:56
we’ve very definitely gained momentum over the last decade,
2:23:00
and so, we are doing a lot.
2:23:03
But the question is, are we going to do enough fast enough,
2:23:11
before we’re totally overwhelmed by it being burned black?
2:23:15
Now, the B & B burn was on the crest, but also the east side,
2:23:20
would that be a case-in-point?
2:23:21
[Large fire centered near Santiam Pass, Central Cascades]
2:23:22
It certainly is a case-in-point.
2:23:25
Not all of it, because it didn’t just burn frequent fire forest, it burned a lot of
2:23:34
stand replacement kind of forest, too.
2:23:37
So, it’s a mixture of the two.
2:23:40
But
2:23:43
those forests have been in decline, most of those forests on the east side,
2:23:48
have been in decline throughout my entire career, the last fifty years.
2:23:54
Is that probably because, even before all the dynamics [political] changed, it
2:23:58
wasn’t as merchantable or shall we say, proactively manageable, in a real sense?
2:24:06
Well, it was being managed to produce stand replacement forests.
2:24:14
It wasn’t just fire suppression.
2:24:16
We were clear-cutting and planting it into plantations that were very
2:24:19
dense, so we were managing it to the degree we were for timber production,
2:24:27
and we were not managing it all to be resilient in the face of fire.
2:24:32
And
2:24:36
spruce budworm epidemics, they were always going on in that forest.
2:24:43
The first major fire that I remember was in 1966,
2:24:50
and, you know, they just got more and bigger.
2:24:53
I
2:24:56
got some numbers the other day from the Fish and Wildlife Service,
2:24:59
that there were at one point, 44
2:25:04
spotted owl territories.
2:25:08
Between the B&B Fire and the Davis Fire, they are now down to four occupied sites.
2:25:18
That’s pretty grim.
2:25:19
That’s pretty damn grim.
2:25:21
That’s like nine, well, one out of—that’s nine percent.
2:25:24
So anyway, I’d say that due to the Northwest Forest Plan, we’ve made
2:25:33
real progress in the conservation and restoration of old forests on
2:25:39
the west side on federal lands.
2:25:44
So, we’ve had largely a positive influence.
2:25:48
On the east side, the plan did nothing to stimulate activity, and delayed it.
2:25:55
But based on
2:26:00
other incentives, we are beginning to do a lot.
2:26:06
What would have happened, in your view, purely speculative, if there
2:26:10
was never a Northwest Forest Plan?
2:26:12
Where would we be in 2016?
2:26:14
We’d be in court?
2:26:18
I don’t know.
2:26:19
I don’t know where we’d be because,
2:26:25
if there
2:26:29
was no alternative
2:26:33
route forward, given the laws that we have.
2:26:40
So,
2:26:43
assuming that the laws stayed the same,
2:26:54
if you didn’t resolve it legally in some way as we did with the Northwest Forest
2:26:59
Plan, nothing would be going on, I think.
2:27:06
One thing that you kind of brushed over, but I would want to get at least a couple
2:27:10
anecdotes about, is the Clinton Summit.
2:27:13
You did mention it, but you said the FEMAT was much more important.
2:27:16
But for the sake of the record, could you talk just a little bit about
2:27:20
the experience of being involved in that, and what you actually
2:27:23
spoke during that, and so on?
2:27:26
Oh, yeah, it was cool.
2:27:26
So, just tell us a little bit about that.
2:27:30
Well,
2:27:33
it was a very important event because what Clinton did was to
2:27:41
demonstrate the importance of this problem as far as he was concerned.
2:27:47
He came and brought much of the cabinet with him, and they spent a week at this.
2:27:57
So, he was putting down some serious
2:28:04
markers that, I think this is really important, important
2:28:09
enough I’m giving it attention.
2:28:12
By doing that, he gave
2:28:16
currency to the actual development of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:28:24
Now, there was one day that was actually televised, or portions of it were?
2:28:30
There were actually parts of two days.
2:28:32
Parts of two days.
2:28:32
And now, you testified during that, it was like a big, huge roundtable
2:28:38
kind of a thing, wasn’t it?
2:28:39
Uh-huh.
2:28:39
What do you remember about that?
2:28:41
It was Clinton, it’s his cabinet, and other people.
2:28:44
What do you remember about that, and also, your testimony?
2:28:47
What I remember most about it; I don’t remember what I said, and it wasn’t for
2:28:54
very long, whatever it was, it was brief.
2:28:58
What I remember most is sitting next to the Vice President [Gore]
2:29:01
, and him passing notes to me all
2:29:06
the time.
2:29:06
[Laughs]
2:29:06
Do you remember what Al said to you?
2:29:08
Al Gore?
2:29:09
Yeah, he was asking me questions,
2:29:15
every once in a while, well, like, what did you think of that?
2:29:18
Some comments like that, you know?
2:29:22
So, anyway, it was
2:29:26
a real ego trip to be there and sitting at that roundtable.
2:29:31
Kind of like, well, I’ve arrived now, right?
2:29:35
Wow.
2:29:35
No,
2:29:40
I’m not sure I took it so much that way, as what I care about is
2:29:46
really centered to this agenda here.
2:29:50
Wow, we’re going to change what we’re going to do with these forests.
2:29:56
And you can correct me if I’m wrong here, but you represented a
2:30:02
countercurrent and ideas that were counter to many established norms.
2:30:08
Oh, yeah.
2:30:09
And so, you were considered a gadfly.
2:30:11
A renegade.
2:30:12
A renegade for a long time in the Forest Service and in academia.
2:30:15
Still am.
2:30:16
Still am, but I mean, before it was normalized.
2:30:19
[Laughs] At least, with some people, right?
2:30:21
So, it must have been vindication to some degree for you?
2:30:25
I don’t mean that in a negative sense, but just validation, probably.
2:30:30
Yeah, validation is much better.
2:30:31
That’s a better term.
2:30:32
Vindication’s an angry word.
2:30:33
Yeah,
2:30:37
it was validation and I was grateful.
2:30:40
And I was very aware of how lucky I was to be in the place I was at the time.
2:30:51
And so, gratitude and
2:30:59
joy at the change in the policy, the change in the perspective.
2:31:07
And I don’t take it for granted, and I worried because, you
2:31:15
know, it can go the other way.
2:31:21
How hard would it be to
2:31:23
— Not hard.
2:31:24
— change everything?
2:31:25
Not hard.
2:31:27
And you know exactly what I’m talking about.
2:31:29
You bet.
2:31:30
We just had a 9.0 earthquake, politically.
2:31:38
[election]
2:31:38
I was just thinking today about, you know, that all of this was done by executive
2:31:44
action, and whatever is done by executive action can be undone by executive action.
2:31:52
And I said, and I would say today, the environmental community were fools.
2:32:02
As soon as the Northwest Forest Plan happened, their priority should have been
2:32:06
to get it legislated, and they didn’t.
2:32:11
And they could lose every bit of it today, because it is solely
2:32:18
based on presidential action.
2:32:22
So, they were fools.
2:32:26
And you know, it reminds me of what Congressman Miller from California
2:32:32
--- George Miller?
2:32:33
George Miller.
2:32:34
After we went in briefed him on the Northwest Forest Plan, he said, “Okay,
2:32:42
you go back and tell your environmental friends that, you can hold up the
2:32:48
stage, and you can get the strong box, but if you hang out for the watches
2:32:54
and the rings, the sheriff’s going to get you.” They should have got away
2:33:02
with it, and that would have been translating this from an executive
2:33:08
action into a legislative action.
2:33:11
And they’re so arrogant, so
2:33:15
unthoughtful about what could happen, that they didn’t do it.
2:33:20
But in all fairness, Jerry, don’t you think I has something
2:33:22
to do with, remember the timing.
2:33:24
In 1994, the Gingrich mid-term, counter-reaction and “Contract
2:33:31
with America,” and really, that’s the beginning of this reactionary
2:33:36
movement, in parts of Congress, anyway.
2:33:39
Sure.
2:33:39
So, it would have been awful hard to get through, don’t you think?
2:33:45
I don’t know.
2:33:46
I think it’s a fair question though.
2:33:48
I think, I think they could have done it.
2:33:54
And if they had been working on that rather than trying to make the plan
2:34:00
unworkable, which is what they did,
2:34:06
they might have been able to do it.
2:34:10
But anyway.
2:34:11
So, do you think that even acts like the Endangered Species Act and
2:34:16
some of those acts are in danger?
2:34:19
Sure.
2:34:20
I mean, that takes much more than an executive order, but
2:34:23
--- Sure, and the only thing we’ve got left to us is that 60 votes in the Senate.
2:34:30
Because of the filibuster act.
2:34:30
[Not an act, but how it was being used.]
2:34:30
Because of the filibuster.
2:34:32
But that could be changed.
2:34:37
To a simple majority?
2:34:38
To a simple majority.
2:34:40
And anyway,
2:34:46
they could do it.
2:34:48
And this guy’s radical enough that, George Bush, Jr., you know, the younger Bush,
2:34:58
was not smart enough and radical enough
2:35:05
to do something like that, to pull that off.
2:35:08
This guy is.
2:35:12
[President-elect Trump]
2:35:13
Or at least the people around him.
2:35:17
So, yeah, I know, it’s scary.
2:35:21
I don’t think he’s smart, incidentally.
2:35:23
I’m not suggesting he’s bright.
2:35:26
He’s quite gullible.
2:35:28
Oh, good.
2:35:28
And like you say,
2:35:31
“Sounds good to me.
2:35:34
Let’s do it.”
2:35:39
What have you learned from the Northwest Forest Plan process regarding
2:35:42
proactive management, but also human limitations on managing nature?
2:35:57
I think a couple of things about it.
2:35:59
First,
2:36:03
as I told you earlier, we should have emphasized active management
2:36:08
as much as we did preservation.
2:36:15
But I think, we really have a body of knowledge that would allow us
2:36:23
to collaborate effectively with the forest that we didn’t have.
2:36:31
If we would choose to use that knowledge, I think we’re in a better position than
2:36:37
we’ve ever been to do things that are good for both the forest and society.
2:36:45
What does this tell you about science, its limitations and its role?
2:36:52
I mean, obviously, you had all the science people together and this was a
2:36:55
novel thing celebrated by your community.
2:37:00
But what does it teach you about the limitations of
2:37:02
science or the vulnerabilities of decisions based on science?
2:37:09
I’m not sure.
2:37:11
I think one of the things that has become very clear, is that science is not going
2:37:17
to be necessarily the determinate of
2:37:22
the decisions that are made.
2:37:25
But at the same
2:37:30
time, as long as we have laws like the Endangered Species Act and National
2:37:37
Forest Management Act, that require scientifically-credible plans,
2:37:48
I’m very hopeful.
2:37:51
And the way those have been written and interpreted, they require
2:38:02
scientifically-credible plans or else the courts are going
2:38:07
to find them in violation.
2:38:12
Last few questions about people.
2:38:15
Kind of give me little paragraph synopses.
2:38:18
I’m going to drop some names, and just kind of say, this is what I think
2:38:23
about when we bring up this name.
2:38:25
Jack Ward Thomas?
2:38:30
A big man.
2:38:32
A big ego.
2:38:43
And a very complicated guy, but very definitely
2:38:53
a guy that sincerely sought to do good.
2:38:59
But at the same time, you know, it’s hard for me to be objective about Jack
2:39:10
because he’s very competitive with me.
2:39:19
I think it’s unfortunate that Jack,
2:39:25
probably it was expecting too much, but I really expected him to be more
2:39:31
independent as a chief than he was.
2:39:35
When he was Forest Service chief?
2:39:36
It was only two or three years, right?
2:39:38
Yeah, and he did some things that really needed to be done, in terms of morale,
2:39:44
and in terms of representing the agency that we were going to follow the law.
2:39:51
If you don’t like it, change the law.
2:39:56
But at the same time, I think he was trapped in a bubble.
2:40:02
And I think his successor
2:40:11
probably might, did more than, much more
2:40:17
than Jack did, to actually change the content of what was being done.
2:40:24
Was his successor Dombeck?
2:40:25
Mike Dombeck, yeah.
2:40:27
Right, Mike Dombeck.
2:40:27
And he was able to do that because he kept, he stayed outside the bubble.
2:40:38
Another person that’s no longer with us, Jim Sedell.
2:40:41
Oh, Jim was wonderful.
2:40:43
And you know, he had an energy and enthusiasm.
2:40:49
I used to describe Jim as
2:40:54
a guy that’s skipping along just dropping petals, rosebuds everywhere.
2:41:02
And he was just an incredible source of ideas and enthusiasm and energy.
2:41:10
But he needed several people to sweep up after him.
2:41:16
So, he was a tornado that created all this stuff, and then
2:41:21
— And he generated a lot of ideas, and other people took them and often got
2:41:27
credit for them, but they were really his.
2:41:30
For example, what would be an idea that was his?
2:41:34
Oh, I think
2:41:38
in many ways, the river continuum concept was very much something of his making.
2:41:45
He was very good at bringing people together and stimulating a
2:41:57
team.
2:41:58
Wonderful.
2:42:02
Just a very positive person.
2:42:05
Very ironic and sad, that both he and Jack died of the same illness.
2:42:12
Yeah, pretty much, that’s right.
2:42:14
Pancreatic cancer, I believe.
2:42:16
I didn’t know for sure which cancer got Jack, but that certainly was.
2:42:20
I’ve heard it was pancreatic.
2:42:21
Yeah, but he fought it longer.
2:42:24
He had a remission, I guess, then it came back.
2:42:27
With Jim, it took him pretty quick.
2:42:30
Jack, you know, was an incredible storyteller.
2:42:34
And if you ever, have you read his book, “Forks in the Trail”?
2:42:40
No.
2:42:40
You need to get that book and read some of those stories.
2:42:44
They’re absolutely uproarious.
2:42:47
Marty Raphael, yesterday, in our interview, told me a couple of the
2:42:51
stories, because he traveled to India with him a couple of times.
2:42:55
And he says, the people that knew Jack, as he’d start going on with his stories,
2:43:00
Marty said, we’d finish the story because we’ve heard it so many times before.
2:43:05
But they said it with affection, you know?
2:43:09
Yeah.
2:43:11
Norm Johnson?
2:43:15
One of the most generous people that I’ve ever worked
2:43:20
with.
2:43:21
Brilliant,
2:43:25
an incredible analytic mind.
2:43:27
And he has done so many things
2:43:32
that he lets other people get credit for.
2:43:38
He was the one that made the Gang of Four a success.
2:43:43
And he did it in terms of both the logistics and in terms of
2:43:47
the intellectual content of
2:43:55
it.
2:43:56
And we [Franklin and Johnson] wrote a paper ten years after
2:44:01
the Northwest Forest Plan for Conservation Biology on the Northwest
2:44:08
Forest Plan, and he had all four of us
2:44:15
as authors of the Gang of Four, even though John Gordon wasn’t one of
2:44:20
the people involved, actually, with
2:44:25
the Northwest Forest Plan itself.
2:44:26
And he insisted, you know, that Jack needed to be the senior author,
2:44:33
that he deserved to be that.
2:44:35
Well, Jack didn’t probably write two words in the whole god-damned manuscript.
2:44:39
Norm and I did it.
2:44:42
But that’s just Norm.
2:44:44
But that also might have been political pragmatism as well
2:44:48
because of name recognition perhaps?
2:44:50
Well, and he would say that.
2:44:53
But in this case, he thought that Jack deserved it because he was the
2:44:58
leader of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:45:01
But he’s doing the same thing with the book that we’re publishing,
2:45:06
Ecological Forest Management.
2:45:08
[Published in] The whole thing started with a project he was contracted to do.
2:45:12
And so, eighteen months ago when we got into really beginning to write it,
2:45:20
he called me up and said, you know, the authorship is going to be Norm,
2:45:29
me and Debbie.
2:45:29
And he called me up and said, “I talked with Debbie and you
2:45:31
should be the senior author.”
2:45:33
Debbie who?
2:45:34
Debbie Johnson, his wife.
2:45:35
Oh, okay.
2:45:36
The three of us are on it.
2:45:38
Oh, okay.
2:45:39
And I protested and I continued to protest, and he says, “No, you
2:45:48
should be the senior author, and that’s because we’ll sell more books
2:45:54
that way.”
2:45:55
[Laughs] Pragmatism.
2:45:56
He is pragmatic, but he’s also a wonderful, generous person.
2:46:03
And also, a really close friend of yours, too.
2:46:05
Oh, I love working with him, and we’re an excellent team.
2:46:12
And you have fun doing it, right?
2:46:15
We have fun doing it and we respect each other, and so we’re
2:46:20
not afraid to say anything.
2:46:24
And it’s wonderful.
2:46:28
I hope we can continue to do it for the rest of our lives.
2:46:32
John Gordon?
2:46:34
John is kind of an enigma.
2:46:38
He is
2:46:41
the nearest thing we have to a statesman, and he put together the Forestry Congress.
2:46:59
But once he’s retired, he doesn’t have the continuing interest in it,
2:47:05
nor is he willing to do anything that he doesn’t get paid for.
2:47:12
Norm and I have done a hell of a lot of stuff we wouldn’t get paid for.
2:47:17
So,
2:47:20
I like John, I’ve always admired and respected him, and it’s always amazed
2:47:26
me how his presence is commanding.
2:47:32
And I wish that
2:47:37
his Forestry Congress had been more successful.
2:47:42
Though I really looked at him as being the nearest thing to a statesman
2:47:50
that we’ve had, and who is not strongly identified with any ideology,
2:47:57
any particular set of interests.
2:48:01
He’s got a very good mind, very
2:48:08
analytic mind.
2:48:10
Gordie Reeves?
2:48:13
I don’t know Gordie that well, really.
2:48:15
I knew Jim Sedell much better.
2:48:17
I’m just thinking of all the members of “Gang of Four - Plus
2:48:20
Two,” so I’ve covered them all.
2:48:21
I wanted equal opportunity here to tie things up.
2:48:28
I think Gordie has so much experience.
2:48:34
He’s such a deep well as far as expertise is concerned.
2:48:40
And you know, he’s a fisherman originally, and a scientist.
2:48:50
I think, if I had any criticism to make of Gordie, it’s that
2:48:57
one of his great strengths is his persistence and courage, and
2:49:06
perhaps one of his weaknesses, is that he gets ahold of something
2:49:15
and perhaps loses perspective on it in terms of its importance or value.
2:49:25
I’ve never worked much with Gordie because he was not a part of the ecosystem team.
2:49:33
Jim Sedell was.
2:49:37
Fred [Swanson] was.
2:49:39
Jim Hall was.
2:49:41
Stan Gregory was.
2:49:42
So,
2:49:47
I’ve gotten to know
2:49:53
them, much more personally connected to Jim Sedell and
2:50:00
Stan Gregory than to Gordie.
2:50:05
But I have a great respect for Gordon.
2:50:10
What about lesser-known people that were involved with the original process, but
2:50:16
especially the long monitoring process that’s gone on, either by naming somebody,
2:50:21
or by just making a statement about all the people that have continued this work?
2:50:27
The monitoring of and the continued planning and reassessments, and
2:50:32
implementation of different things?
2:50:35
Sure.
2:50:35
Well, I think, Tom Spies sort of stands out.
2:50:38
Yeah.
2:50:40
I should have asked you about Tom.
2:50:42
Say something about Tom.
2:50:43
Well, Tom is just such a dutiful and competent individual,
2:50:54
and has provided so much continuity.
2:50:57
So,
2:51:02
I think he’s outstanding, and I guess, that should be obvious
2:51:07
by the fact he’s the senior author on the science synthesis.
2:51:16
I wish at times he was a little more adventuresome and not quite
2:51:20
so conservative, but I made a good choice when I hired him.
2:51:30
Fred Swanson?
2:51:31
Oh.
2:51:34
[Laughs] He’s just great.
2:51:40
He’s always challenged me, and it’s been a very positive and
2:51:46
stimulating kind of a thing.
2:51:49
Fred is just an
2:51:53
incredible intellect and thoughtful individual, and
2:51:58
obviously, extremely sensitive.
2:52:03
What did he bring to the Northwest Forest Plan, because he kind of came
2:52:07
at it from the fringes, but he still kind of maintained his tentacles,
2:52:11
and he kind of does everything, he even does poetry and the humanities
2:52:14
stuff that he’s continued to do.
2:52:16
But a person like that seems to be just as necessary as the
2:52:20
people that are more singularly focused on one aspect of something.
2:52:26
First of all,
2:52:29
his role in the Northwest Forest planning process was really to
2:52:36
help develop the aquatic strategy.
2:52:39
In that respect, he was outstanding, and he’s always had a very large
2:52:44
spatial perspective on things, which has only grown over the years.
2:52:50
But he’s really a disturbance ecologist.
2:52:55
And so, he really evolved from being a geologist to a disturbance scientist.
2:53:03
And he brings his own brand of energy and enthusiasm to things,
2:53:11
and also, he has an outstanding way with the words.
2:53:20
He’s a very good writer.
2:53:22
He’s a good writer and he puts together memorable phrases.
2:53:29
[Laughs] So, and he’s a good friend.
2:53:32
I trust him completely.
2:53:38
So, if you were going to make a capstone statement about the Northwest
2:53:42
Forest Plan, from the perspective of today, what would you say as
2:53:48
regarding forestry, and your life?
2:53:53
What would you say about it?
2:53:58
Well, I think it was an extraordinary group of people that put it together.
2:54:06
And certainly, the Andrews, Corvallis ecosystem scientists,
2:54:16
were absolutely critical.
2:54:22
I’m not sure that we could pull off anything as half as good today.
2:54:36
Maybe
2:54:41
we could.
2:54:41
And why do you think that is?
2:54:44
Do you think that’s because of the extreme polarization of society, the
2:54:49
political malaise, budgetary limitations that have certainly grown over time,
2:54:54
sequestration as a prime example?
2:54:58
Yeah.
2:54:58
I think part of it was the time and commitment of an administration
2:55:05
to bring something, putting something really positive together,
2:55:11
despite all of the forces that were trying to
2:55:19
prevent it or influence it.
2:55:23
I think there’s a real challenge today
2:55:29
to separate.
2:55:31
I think people don’t understand how important it is to separate
2:55:36
the public involvement process from the development of scientifically
2:55:41
credible and legal alternatives.
2:55:43
I think that’s something I’ve only learned.
2:55:47
And whoever, whether it was luck or whether it was somebody smart
2:55:51
enough to understand that’s the way you had to do it, and
2:55:58
that was why it worked.
2:56:00
Because you didn’t open it to the entire democracy?
2:56:03
No, and when they did that subsequently in the Interior Columbia
2:56:08
Basin Project, nothing came of it.
2:56:13
They spent millions of dollars and spent years, and there
2:56:17
was no substantive outcome.
2:56:19
Because everybody was just backbiting and back-and-forth,
2:56:23
and no decisions were made?
2:56:24
Yeah.
2:56:24
You can’t produce scientifically credible legal alternatives in
2:56:31
an open forum, I don’t think.
2:56:37
Well, I mean, going back to the ancient Greeks, they talked
2:56:41
about the foibles of democracy.
2:56:44
And you know, the idea of the philosopher-king, as long as he was
2:56:49
benevolent, would get stuff done.
2:56:51
It’s the same principle.
2:56:52
Yeah, I know.
2:56:54
But, you know,
2:56:57
I think, for example, in revising the Northwest Forest Plan, that
2:57:02
there would be a lot of latitude to have a process in which you
2:57:06
developed a series of alternatives
2:57:10
that stayed within the bounds, scientifically and legally.
2:57:16
And then,
2:57:20
having defined the boundary conditions, then allowed, people working there
2:57:27
with forest-based cooperatives, for example, that really work within that.
2:57:32
But they’ve got some sideboards, and you work within those sideboards.
2:57:36
And
2:57:39
that’s kind of what I’m describing.
2:57:46
So, anyway,
2:57:52
I think it’s there’s got to be an element of luck in pulling these things off.
2:57:59
Timing is everything, correct?
2:58:01
Well, I think that really is true, and it was good timing on it.
2:58:07
And Norm might tell you that it may be the last
2:58:13
productive planning process that’s ever going
2:58:18
to happen.
2:58:19
I’ll let him tell me that.
2:58:20
But why would you, how would you interpret that statement, which has kind of a
2:58:25
fatalistic doom and gloom context to it?
2:58:28
That fundamentally the circumstances are such today, that there’s no way
2:58:33
that you can have an effective forest
2:58:39
planning process.
2:58:39
And that basically we’ll just continue to stumble and fumble along.
2:58:46
Is there anything else that you’d like to say as a concluding statement,
2:58:50
something that you might want to say that we haven’t talked about yet?
2:58:57
I don’t think so, but we’ve been at it quite a while.
2:59:01
Three hours on the record, Jerry.
2:59:03
Yeah.
2:59:04
I think we’re both fizzling out of energy here, so we will make it a formal
2:59:10
sign-off right now, and I will shake your hand and tell you, thank you very
2:59:14
much for spending an afternoon with me and talking about the Northwest
2:59:18
Forest Plan among many other subjects.
2:59:20
And this is Sam Schmieding, Oregon State University, signing off
2:59:24
at Jerry Franklin’s house, and
2:59:28
what’s the name of your city?
2:59:29
Issaquah, Washington.
2:59:30
Issaquah, I’m sorry, I drew a blank.
2:59:32
Issaquah, Washington, on Squak Mountain.
2:59:33
We’re on the north slope of Squak Mountain, in Issaquah.
2:59:37
We’re in the “Issaquah Alps.” [Local name] Anyway, signing off.
