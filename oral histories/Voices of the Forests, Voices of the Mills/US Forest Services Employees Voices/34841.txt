00:00
What was the relationship between research and management like in the early days
00:06
of the Blue River Experimental Forest?
00:08
Roy, would you give us a little feedback on some of those questions and then
00:12
we’ll throw it open to other questions.
00:14
When I talked to Fred, I told him, I would prepare a presentation.
00:21
I am retired and I find that in preparing a presentation I put in
00:25
about as much as I would on a paper,
00:31
so I said let’s have it just be a question and answer session.
00:36
What I plan to do is go around the table and every one of you
00:39
ask a question, if that’s okay.
00:42
We will see how it comes out, and we can go around a second
00:44
time if time is not used up.
00:48
And Fred, you said you would ask a specific question, you have about four
00:53
of them in what you’ve said so far.
00:57
[Crowd laughter]
00:59
Well, just sort of for the record, I’d like to you to just say a few comments
01:05
about the very beginning of the Andrew’s and what sorts of roles you and the
01:11
other researchers had in beginning to work on that experimental forest.
01:18
Alright.
01:18
I
01:21
began working on the Andrews Experimental Forest in 1948.
01:25
It wasn’t called the Andrews, it was called Blue River Experimental Forest.
01:31
The experimental forest had been carved out of the Willamette National Forest
01:37
and there was a bit of loose ends that happened and one of the loose ends was
01:46
that supervisor Bruckart, who was going after the record for cutting more timber
01:53
than any other national forest, [crowd laughter] said that he wouldn’t give it up
01:58
unless we cut 20 million board feet a year off the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest.
02:03
Well, sustained annual yield was 7 billion board feet a year, but the
02:09
station agreed to this reluctantly.
02:14
So, when they were looking for someone in the experiment station who might
02:20
be appropriate for this job, they found that I had a minor in logging
02:26
engineering [laughter], so I was the one they picked to show up at
02:32
the Andrews Experimental Forest.
02:35
For the first, actually more than two years,
02:42
getting on top of a 20 million foot lay out of sales was
02:47
all I accomplished up there.
02:50
When you stop and think about a 20 million foot cut right now, it would
02:53
look pretty good on any national forest.
02:57
I think that just the case and point — the man who had an office in our genetics
03:04
project [PNW Research Station] that worked on the Siuslaw [National Forest] , we
03:10
proposed a thinning of one of our plots out near Monmouth and he says if we
03:16
succeed in doing that thinning, that’ll be the biggest sale this year on the Siuslaw.
03:22
So, anyway, I showed up at the Andrews Experimental Forest.
03:30
I was given a trailer to live in at Belknap camp where the
03:34
ranger district was located.
03:38
There were no roads or trails into the forest itself.
03:42
At
03:45
that time the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps] had built trails from McKenzie
03:49
Bridge to Carpenter Mountain and also up the Blue River along Blue River
03:56
Ridge along to Carpenter Mountain.
03:59
That was the entire access, except that the south side of Lookout Ridge
04:05
at that time had a sale that brought a road nearly to the top of Lookout
04:11
Ridge, about where the small watersheds are located [Watersheds 1, 2, 3] . So,
04:14
that was the entire access to it.
04:18
The first year I was there alone, I had a summer-time helper, but I
04:22
was there the first two years and the majority of the time alone.
04:24
Then, Hank Gratkowski was added as a scientist to the staff and I was there
04:31
altogether from 1948 to 1954, although I had some activity after that time.
04:42
The set up was that, I was given no instructions at all except that I was
04:48
supposed to cut 20 million board feet.
04:51
I had however, worked from 1946-1948
04:57
for a number of people in the experiment station, primarily
05:00
under [Leo] Isaac and [Thornton] Munger, while I was in Portland.
05:05
And then under a man named Bob Aufderheide whose
05:11
background was as an assistant supervisor for the Willamette National Forest.
05:15
They picked him because he had ideas on
05:23
how timber sales should be laid out.
05:26
His basic idea was that there should be one hundred percent lay out of any
05:32
area before there was any logging done.
05:36
This was revolutionary at the time and may still be.
05:42
We would go into a place like Henderson Creek, where I worked
05:47
before I came up here, and
05:52
laid out all of the roads, put in p-lines [preliminary alignment] for all
05:55
of the roads, we located every landing, we either located or mapped out the
06:02
cutting boundaries for the whole unit.
06:05
At that time, you chose the settings for it to be logged and made the sale.
06:13
That was a pattern that I followed for the first year I went into
06:19
the Andrews Experimental Forest.
06:20
Mind you, the access road was just over the hill into the area of the Blue
06:28
River Dam and from there on you walked.
06:34
My choice was to make a sale that included the three small [experimental]
06:41
watersheds that are there.
06:44
I reached the upper elevations on that sale by going in from the Lookout
06:49
Creek side through a saddle in between the first and second watersheds.
06:55
The lower elevations, we had to go up from Blue River Lake, and walk
07:02
up to the confluence of Lookout Creek and began sale lay out there.
07:10
I might comment one more thing,
07:17
to finish out the role I had.
07:20
After the second season and into the third season, I began to do
07:27
research into
07:30
natural regeneration following some of the ideas that Isaac had been working on.
07:38
I ended up, when I left, doing a thesis on lethal surface temperatures, which
07:45
I completed for my doctoral degree.
07:47
Incidentally, my degree is not in genetics, although I took
07:51
all the courses at Oregon State.
07:53
My degree is in Ecology, so I have that kind of background.
08:00
Those latter years, we did
08:06
a lot of different things.
08:08
We had a group from the Oregon Wildlife Research Unit here on the campus that
08:17
furnished two people to the Andrews, a fisheries biologist and an animal person.
08:26
Their names were, Don Wustenberg and Jay Gashwiler.
08:27
Gashwiler published a lot; Wustenberg wasn’t
08:34
there long.
08:35
Don did some very interesting work on fisheries and this is the thing I asked
08:41
people, if you saw a hole in the river that was 70 feet long and as wide as
08:49
Lookout Creek, how many fish do you think were there when the area was primeval.
08:54
The
08:56
way we went at it was that we put a net at upper and lower end of the
09:01
70-foot hole and began to go through the hole with a fine net that would
09:06
let out fish, probably that long and smaller and clip every fin of the fish.
09:14
Every fish would have a clipped fin by the time we got to the other end.
09:16
The first time we got about four or five hundred fish.
09:22
By the time we had gone through for the fifth time, there was very few fish
09:26
who did not have a clipped fin, so we could quite accurately estimate that
09:30
there were over 11,000 fish in there.
09:32
Imagine that.
09:35
Was that just trout or included all fish?
09:37
Everything.
09:38
Yeah,
09:40
and I don’t know how many people have actually been in primeval
09:47
conditions, but here’s an example of what you can find on the Andrews.
09:53
The crew that surveyed the access road had worked as far as the
10:01
mouth of McCrae Creek, so that area had been fished probably - some.
10:15
Beyond McCrae Creek, I remember going one time to a hole, coming in from the
10:21
south side, and looking over this bank for five feet into this hole, which had
10:26
a lot of logs in it, fairly deep and I took a little twig and tossed it out there
10:31
and it looked just like a fish hatching.
10:33
Jesus, I said, you don’t see that anymore, I don’t know
10:36
where in the world you see that.
10:39
In Wyatt’s thesis and Wustenberg’s thesis, they mention the chinook occasionally.
10:45
Do you remember running into chinook.
10:47
No, I didn’t.
10:50
Well,
10:54
what else can I say in answer to your question.
10:57
Well, I do wonder how the relationship between research and management
11:01
developed over say the first decade.
11:03
How long did
11:07
you remain a principle player down there?
11:11
I left in 1954 and took over the genetics work [in the Pacific Northwest Research
11:15
Station] , that was the end of it.
11:16
Imagine, going from working on timber sales
11:21
to working on genetics.
11:22
Well,
11:26
that’s how long.
11:28
Beyond that, I just didn’t go back to the Andrews.
11:33
It’s kind of a personal thing.
11:35
You get to where you love a certain piece of country and
11:38
you don’t want to see it hurt.
11:40
And I loved that piece of country and I just didn’t want to go back and see it.
11:47
Can you imagine that?
11:54
Let’s go on around the room.
11:56
Hi, Roy, I’m Jack Lattin, entomologist.
11:59
I’d be very interested.
12:01
It looks as though Douglas-fir bark beetles is beginning to come back.
12:05
It happens that, as you’ve heard many times before,
12:11
most of the people that were involved in those original efforts are
12:16
not around anymore.
12:17
So, I would be interested in your observations on insects that may have
12:24
reached pests status in those early days or not, whether there aren’t any.
12:28
I have one story to tell about it.
12:33
Think it was 1951, it was a dry year,
12:38
I was keeping records of surface temperatures at that time, so I
12:46
was very cognizant of this.
12:49
April 1st was the last rain we got, and it didn’t rain until September 3rd.
12:55
That was dry.
12:58
As a result, the next year we had a beetle attack.
13:05
I heard, just going to Portland in the winter time, that this was a
13:09
serious problem over the region.
13:12
But I didn’t really notice until I went back to the Andrews there
13:15
were trees all over that were browning, and [becoming] beetle kill.
13:22
I
13:25
thought, well, this is something that might be kind of interesting.
13:29
So, I took sections where I could see the number and concluded
13:36
that less than 1% of old-growth trees had died from the epidemic.
13:45
I thought, well, this is kind of minor and never thought anything more about it.
13:50
And then, the survey was done over the region, and, of all things, this was
13:54
one of the heavy areas in the survey.
13:58
And I thought to myself, the way we’re going at it, we’ll salvage all
14:02
that mortality in the next ten years.
14:05
I don’t see where there’s a big problem with it.
14:09
Were there any examples of
14:14
defoliators?
14:14
No.
14:18
Well actually, I shouldn’t say no.
14:20
The Spruce budworm worked the upper elevations.
14:25
And the upper elevation of the Andrews was one of the areas they sprayed with DDT.
14:35
That was in about 1952 or 1953.
14:43
There was one pilot that was killed who flew into the border of
14:49
the mountain, spraying.
14:49
Flew his plane into the mountain.
14:51
We had to pack him out.
15:02
I am Lynn Burditt, I’m the district ranger for Blue River.
15:05
Building
15:14
on what Fred said, it sounds like you had an interesting relationship
15:18
with forest managers there.
15:24
From my perspective, what do you see as positive relationship between the
15:29
research side and management side?
15:32
Do you mean in those days?
15:43
It was a relationship that started off badly with Bruckart, watching that cut.
15:55
He was not friendly to our effort there.
16:02
They watched every move I made.
16:04
I didn’t know it, but I was a political figure, without even knowing it.
16:08
I was producing information on
16:13
silvicultural things that would slow down the silviculture and he didn’t want that.
16:24
The other thing that was a problem to them was I inherited from Aufterheide,
16:36
who was promoting 100
16:41
percent sale layout, which would take about three times as long to do lay
16:48
out; only lay out about a third as much.
16:52
That was a problem.
16:53
But then, I added to that, that really what should be done is to
17:02
go after the methods that would do the minimum damage to the resource.
17:08
I
17:12
very carefully kept any activity out of the leave units.
17:19
Where there was wind fall in the leave units, I’d make very low-gradient roads
17:27
so there would be no sedimentation from them, and do the logging with [system]
17:34
, which didn’t have to get off the road.
17:39
It wasn’t that there was anything wrong or they were objecting to the
17:44
methods, it’s just the slow down.
17:46
I am
17:50
trying to think of anything else that would be a good example of
17:56
problems with that.
17:59
I was starting in the strip clear cuts and with small clear cuts, which
18:05
from my view was done just trying to get information on regeneration.
18:09
But it was interpreted as, this is a way of the future or something.
18:12
A lot of misunderstandings.
18:16
Did management come around to adopting some of those practices you were
18:22
experimenting with or promoting?
18:24
Yes, I think some of them were.
18:27
We would put them into
18:31
contract items in the sale.
18:32
If we wanted to have the culverts handled a certain way, or drainage
18:37
handled a certain way, or tractors off the ground a certain time of year,
18:43
we just put it into the contract.
18:45
Of course, they didn’t like that either.
18:50
We were very successful in certain things and I am sure there was a carry over.
18:57
For one thing, Don Wustenberg, the first year he was in there, when the
19:03
sale was going on, informed me that every fish had been wiped out, from
19:08
every tributary down to Lookout Creek.
19:12
Of course, they were wiped out, all the pools were filled with
19:17
sediment.
19:17
So, we decided we would see how much we could deal with that problem.
19:24
We started putting items into the contract that would require them to,
19:33
when they came to a stream,
19:38
they would fall timber away from the stream, so there would be a
19:42
minimum to the stream to begin with.
19:44
When the cats made their first attempt along the right-of-way they would
19:52
make a road on the first cut that you make on the top of a cut.
19:58
When they got to the stream, they were required to pull out any material that
20:04
they left.
20:04
So, generally we had clear going when the grading began.
20:10
And when the grading began, the culverts I had them, whenever
20:14
possible, divert the stream so there would be minimum sedimentation.
20:23
We cut down the sedimentation to such an extent that by sale two, Wustenberg
20:29
informed me that we hadn’t lost a fish.
20:31
It was just a matter of detail.
20:36
I can’t think of anything else.
20:40
I’m John Cissel, I also work at Blue River [Ranger District] . I was curious
20:45
as to, I don’t know if you’ve been up to the Forest anytime lately, but if there
20:51
are any changes from fire suppression that you see from now compared to then
20:58
or noticing back then compared before
21:22
fire were being suppressed as to the kinds of forest stands you’d see.
21:22
I couldn’t answer that question.
21:22
I haven’t been up there enough, I’m in genetics.
21:23
I’m not in timber anymore.
21:23
Fire suppression was well developed by the 50s.
21:26
They had big fires and they could handle most anything.
21:30
But, strangely, the burning of slash was one of those things that still needed
21:36
some attention because the only time they would burn slash was after the fall rains.
21:41
They got in a lot of trouble with that sort of thing.
21:47
What bothered me was that they would get these big backlogs of slash on
21:53
units that needed to be burned and then they’d try to burn the four
21:57
years of burning all in one year and, of course, it would go everywhere.
22:04
Some of it went over my plots and I did not like that.
22:15
I’m Art McKee, director at Andrews.
22:21
I do a lot of hand holding and nose wiping, of technicians and
22:25
undergraduates and graduate students at the Andrews who complain about
22:28
the hardships of working out there.
22:31
I’d like your observations out there when you had to get in
22:36
through foot or horseback and had to go in for a week at a time.
22:41
How do you handle that.
22:41
I’ll start out by saying that I lived in a trailer out by
22:45
Belknap camp.
22:48
I was a bachelor.
22:49
I didn’t like to cook.
22:50
I found a family that gave me all the meals for a price.
22:54
That
22:57
was the situation with starting out.
23:03
The sale layout always had to be quite a ways ahead of the last road.
23:07
You walked in at least a mile or more before you started your sale layout.
23:11
So, we put a pack on our back with a week’s supply of everything and
23:19
start over the wind falls and go in two or three miles, establish a
23:25
camp, all we had was a 9x12 silcolin fly, to protect us from the weather.
23:32
Sleeping bags and we would pack our aluminum tags and our staplers
23:42
and maps and few other things, and we did all our surveying with 10-foot pole.
23:53
We worked as one man crews all the time because it was so much more efficient.
23:56
We
23:59
had organized to be able to do everything alone.
24:01
Stapler, a stapling gun and
24:06
aluminum tags allowed us to run a line by tilting the tag up a certain way so you
24:11
could get the reflection going right, then you’d go as far back so you could see that
24:15
and get your grade and put another tag up.
24:22
The section lines were surveyed a little more carefully, but
24:26
the chain lines were put in with 10 foot poles and they
24:32
were a little off in places.
24:35
That
24:39
is the way we lived right until Fall and it got pretty rainy
24:42
in the Fall [Crowd laughter].
24:44
I can remember one time,
24:48
I was in there and Carl Berntsen was going with me that week, and we established
24:55
camp and one of these storms came in that you hear the thunder way down the valley.
25:01
You just count the number of seconds and it gets fewer seconds and fewer seconds
25:06
and we’d look up and we’d see the old growth start waving around and then
25:12
it got close enough to where you start hearing them come down, rrrrrrornkk, and
25:20
[laughter] finally the storm passed.
25:23
We both got up and urinated.
25:30
[Crowd laughter].
25:31
Surprising how
25:42
much of the time I worked alone up there.
25:45
Nobody else, I worked alone.
25:53
People worked alone a lot those days.
26:03
A story got around the experiment station.
26:08
I was a bachelor.
26:12
I had quite a few friends who liked to come up to the McKenzie
26:15
to fish on the weekends.
26:18
So, it was hard for me to get down to Eugene to cash these
26:23
paychecks that would arrive every
26:26
two weeks, so I would put these paychecks in a paycheck envelope in
26:34
one of the drawers in the trailer and I forget how many of them I’d had,
26:38
maybe 8 or 9 of them for the season.
26:42
Then McKenzie district felt we were supposed to help the McKenzie
26:49
district with fire so Hank Gratkowski and I were called to this big
26:54
Tumble Creek fire in Detroit.
26:57
They seemed to always put Hank and I on scouting.
27:03
I asked Al Weiner one time, how come we always got on scouting.
27:10
Well, your guys’ feet wouldn’t wear out.
27:15
That’s what we were valuable for!
27:22
Well, anyways, coming back two weeks from the fire, opened the
27:27
drawer in the trailer, and the mice had gotten in and made a nest.
27:34
I hauled out my paycheck envelope and it was nibbled all along
27:39
all the paychecks that I’d had.
27:44
I sent the checks up to Portland and nobody could believe
27:50
that I had 8 paychecks.
27:52
They had a hard time with the numbers, but
27:59
I got paid.
28:00
[Crowd laughter].
28:01
How much was one of those paychecks?
28:04
The paychecks were $120 or something.
28:19
Wondering if you could give us a feeling for how much was left behind
28:24
then versus now…do you have pictures of some of the cuts that were made?
28:30
No, I don’t.
28:30
I don’t know where I’d find them anymore.
28:34
I had a camera but there was no official picture taking that I know of.
28:42
They would leave quite a bit of material because there was the
28:47
usual rot in the old growth.
28:54
We would harvest forty to seventy or eighty thousand board feet of
29:02
scalable volume off those units but I wouldn’t be surprised if today
29:08
they’d be taking a third more of them because there were a lot of
29:13
logs left but they were pretty juicy.
29:16
It
29:22
depended on where you were in the drainage because one of the things
29:27
that got rather obvious to Hank Gratkowski and me was that the forest
29:34
was in all stages of preservation.
29:38
Fire
29:40
had swept through there four hundred years ago and had covered almost everything.
29:44
As far as I could see, the four-hundred-year age class was
29:48
represented virtually everywhere except on the ridge tops, which had burned
29:52
again, and there were hundred-year-old [stands] all along the ridge top.
29:57
There were occasionally older and bigger trees that outdated the fire.
30:03
But the stands had deteriorated at different rates after that
30:09
fire and the principle agency was rots, butt rots and stem rots.
30:18
The trees would break or fall over.
30:21
In some areas the rotting was
30:28
creating openings, like Poria weirii [current name: Phellinus weirii] , where
30:30
others had quite a few trees in them and
30:37
we began to ask ourselves, if it’s going to take 80-100 years
30:41
for the rotation, what stands are going to last for 80-100 years.
30:47
It’s not going to be those that are almost deteriorated already, it’s going to be
30:52
the very densest, well preserved ones.
30:55
I remember, the way that worked out was that we began
30:59
to put the deteriorated units
31:04
into our sales.
31:07
The man from the Willamette that did the cruising had cruised several sales and
31:13
said, “One thing I’ve been beginning to notice is how brushy and junky these sales
31:19
are,” and I said, “Well, I got to admit something to you,” and went through this.
31:28
I then thought, boy, I’m going to hear it this time because volumes were less.
31:35
And instead of that, I saw a couple weeks later there was a memo that went out
31:41
to the Willamette National Forest that said, “We are changing our policy in
31:46
picking the units in our sales. We are going to leave those that are more dense
31:50
for the future and…” how about that!
31:54
Just telling somebody and getting that kind of a practice just changed.
31:59
It didn’t work that way very often, only once!
32:08
[Crowd Laughs].
32:08
We didn’t make scale record
32:12
and beside that, once I got through with the sale layout, I didn’t have
32:17
much to do with the handling and the writing up of sales and the scaling
32:23
and so on was all done by the district.
32:27
If you could think of anybody else that was working out there
32:29
that might have some photos.
32:32
Gosh, I don’t know.
32:34
Hank Gratkowski was more of a photo man than myself and I think he’s still around.
32:37
He might have some.
32:41
This one is funny story that doesn’t have to do with the Andrews, but
32:44
it has to do with this period.
32:46
There was this sale that burned near McKenzie Bridge; that burned
32:51
during the McKenzie Bridge fire.
32:53
And, because the logger hadn’t cleaned up the whole area, he put in a claim
33:00
for all the burned logs that were on the ground, as if it had just been
33:03
felled and he lost all his logs.
33:05
Well, the ranger decided that he better go out and look at it, although his
33:10
intention was just to pay him off, it was the Forest Service’s fault.
33:15
So, he went out there with an axe and he went to the log and here was
33:18
a log that had kind of burned out and he chopped and the at edge of
33:23
the burn and he found about that much of the rot and sound wood beyond.
33:28
He went through that whole area and couldn’t find any exceptions to that,
33:32
that every log that had burned had burned out the rots but left a little bit.
33:39
In other words, the guy had logged out all the good timber and he was going to
33:43
make a claim for all the logs out there.
33:47
See, there were plenty of logs out there.
33:48
That’s what I’m saying, a lot of logs out there that he was going to make
33:51
a claim on, but once the ranger took the gentleman out there and had him
33:59
whack a few times with the axe, he said “show me some logs that your
34:04
claiming,” and keep whacking away
34:09
at logs with rot…there was no claim [crowd laughs].
34:12
When it was so densely forested, how many deer or elk did you ever run into?
34:25
Where were they?
34:28
Well, there were no elk that I even heard about.
34:35
The Oregon Corporative Wildlife Research Unit made a survey very early on the
34:46
animal population and I think they came up with five deer to the
34:50
square mile, or something like that!
34:52
They pronounced that area a biological desert.
34:55
And, in fact, as much as we were out there, we seldom saw game.
35:02
Seldom saw bear.
35:05
Once in a great while; once in a great while.
35:08
If we saw
35:11
deer, it was enough of an event that we commented about it.
35:16
It wasn’t very much.
35:18
It sure changed once the logging started opening up.
35:22
All the populations got hit.
35:24
So, even once you started to log you never saw any elk coming in?
35:30
No, I don’t remember any elk.
35:35
There were elk in the McKenzie drainage because I remember the ranger shot
35:38
one, but I didn’t’ see any or find any.
35:46
[Stan Gregory] Simple
35:51
question, the Saddle Creek, the Mack Creek and McCrae and Lookout
35:56
Creeks are all on USGS maps, do you know where those names came from?
35:59
Were they named when you were there?
36:05
No, I don’t know.
36:07
They existed when you were there?
36:08
Yes.
36:09
See there was a quadrangle sheet map of that area.
36:12
It wasn’t very good, but it was a map of it.
36:18
Don
36:23
Henshaw – I managed a lot of the long-term records at the Andrews, records for
36:25
the watersheds one, two, and three.
36:26
Started in 1951 and a lot of the climate stations, too.
36:27
Started in 1951, 1952.
36:27
I was wondering if
36:37
you were involved with any of these.
36:38
Oh yes, I installed those three watersheds, those three
36:44
gages.
36:44
And the climatic station…?
36:50
We serviced them, yes.
36:52
Because all that data still gets used.
36:55
Good.
36:55
Oh, we sent the data up to Portland, but we serviced them.
37:02
Roy, how widely was it perceived in the early days that the Andrews might
37:06
serve as a benchmark or control for what it might have subsequently.
37:12
You mentioned the case of counting the fish in the stream;
37:19
was this widely understood that it might serve other purposes?
37:22
Well,
37:26
you get very little vertical communication in the experiment station and the
37:30
boss hardly ever told me what to do.
37:33
He looked and would see what I was doing and then walked off and left me
37:38
wondering whether I was right or not.
37:42
But in my view,
37:46
we were making a long-term-project and this was intended to be long-term data.
37:54
Uh, trying to think of any way to,
38:00
the watershed data was certainly considered to be long-term data,
38:05
because there was a history of it throughout the Forest Service, there
38:08
was watershed research at experimental forests already, like Coweeta.
38:13
This was supposed to be an addition to that and that’s why
38:16
the small watersheds were started.
38:20
We started the same thing would apply to the harvesting large scale harvesting, but
38:29
I don’t think everybody agreed there.
38:33
Did anybody from Hubbard Brook or Coweeta come out to help establish?
38:37
No, they didn’t come out to help establish, but they did come by, yes.
38:44
There seems to be an early perception in the watershed field and fisheries
38:48
field that this could get some good baseline data, but I wonder is it
38:52
true of other biological aspects of
39:00
the site along wide recognition.
39:00
Not in the same system,
39:05
no.
39:05
No, if anybody would have set it up I would have had to set it up.
39:10
I thought I was setting it up, but it turns out I wasn’t.
39:12
[Steve Wondzell] I’m
39:21
kind of curious, given the time you spent at the Andrews and the subsequent history
39:26
of forestry in the Cascades, if there are things that strike you that people could
39:32
have done different or done differently at H.J. Andrews that could have alleviated
39:38
some of the forestry problems we [see] , and if there are any lessons there for us?
39:45
Oh boy.
39:46
Uh, the problem is not my term on the Andrews it’s what’s going on now.
39:58
Well, I had a pretty free hand as to what I did on the Andrews, I saw
40:02
something I wanted to do and I did it.
40:04
It wasn’t really, I’m not sure the problem with doing what I wanted to.
40:15
It’s more of a problem with the obstacles that were rolled in from the Forest,
40:25
see, every once in a while, when I wanted something done differently by the timber
40:31
operator that I would get visited by the Willamette National Forest on his behalf.
40:36
I
40:43
think that if the National Forest System had adopted some of the same layout
40:50
they would have been a lot better off because what we were doing was solving
40:54
a lot of the silvicultural and watershed and other problems in the way we
41:02
located the landings and the roads and planned for future entry and harvest.
41:11
Of course, at that time it was all natural regeneration and I thought
41:15
that would go on forever, you know.
41:17
It turns out within a few years everybody was planting
41:27
[seedlings]
41:27
. At that the time that you were doing your work there, I guess it was the
41:30
start to using staggered logging as opposed to clearcuts, could
41:38
you talk a little bit about the discussions and the philosophy of making
41:44
that switch and how hard it was for the Forest Service to make that switch?
41:50
Really wasn’t very hard because there wasn’t much cutting on the Forest Service
42:02
before World War II.
42:03
In fact, the timber sales that were proposed in the region before WWII were
42:03
often times resisted by the industry.
42:06
They didn’t want the competition for the wood.
42:08
So, there wasn’t really very much cutting and you see the basis
42:13
for the patch cutting system was Leo Isaac’s publication,
42:18
Reproductive Habits of Douglas-Fir.
42:20
Where he showed that you get adequate stocking up a quarter mile up from the
42:26
timber edge and so half-a-mile wide clearcut, if you went beyond that, you
42:31
were risking not getting good stocking and so the Forest Service was, uh, I
42:41
think committed already to the staggered setting system when the Andrews started.
42:46
Gee, I didn’t have any, I didn’t have any.
42:48
The Willamette was doing it; everybody was doing it.
42:50
So, there was no sort of large scale clearcutting going on?
42:54
Not like before.
42:58
It’s odd because at Cascade Head [Experimental Forest]
43:00
where another version of this
43:06
practical program of harvest cutting was going on, they came to the conclusion
43:14
that their best bet in the Spruce-Hemlock, which was less wind firm than the
43:19
Douglas-fir, was to cut into the wind; to cut a swath each year into the wind which
43:25
was clear cutting, but it was very logical kind of clearcutting, I mean you could get
43:30
big clearcuts that way, but not very fast.
43:40
[Pam Druliner] I was wondering, you said there were a lot of
43:48
obstacles, managers, supervisors, and district managers of Forest
43:55
Service saw you as an obstacle in a lot of cases and tried to work
44:00
around you, who actually established the Blue River Experience Station?
44:08
How was it established, in the face of that?
44:10
Well, uh, there was general agreement at the Portland level, even within
44:20
the Region that there should be another experimental forest.
44:24
There wasn’t any objection from for example H. J. Andrews, who
44:27
was in charge of it, was very favorable to this idea, and, well,
44:37
the background for how it was picked out was that Phillip Briegleb, who had
44:44
been in forest survey for many years
44:51
and had surveyed the forest through this area and looked at this as kind
44:55
of a jewel for an experimental forest.
44:59
When learned the picking was to be done, he picked the spot.
45:05
Uh, there was then a negotiation with the Willamette, that was,
45:12
the Willamette National Forest.
45:14
We didn’t have the same problems with the Siuslaw Forest, Cascade
45:18
Head was doing virtually the same things without any problems.
45:23
You got to remember, that Bruckart’s goal in life was to have that
45:29
record of producing the most timber.
45:32
And when that record was threatened, he did some dumb things.
45:37
I won’t go into
45:43
that [Audience Laughter].
45:45
Where did he end up?
45:47
Where did he end up?
45:48
He retired.
45:54
My name is Matt Hunter; I work at Blue River.
45:58
Roy, I’m wondering what your perspective was when you started working there.
46:04
Was it just a job?
46:06
Did you have a particular desire or ambition you wanted to do?
46:10
What was your perspective?
46:12
Pretty much it was a job, yeah.
46:15
You got to remember that I just had a Forestry degree; and in an
46:21
experiment station that doesn’t put you very high up the ladder.
46:27
I had to get degrees later, so I was somewhat of a flunky, worked for Isaac,
46:37
but when they looked around for somebody that had some logging training, I was
46:44
the only one, nobody else in the station.
46:46
So, I ended up there.
46:49
It was a great place, you know, my goodness, fish every evening you know,
46:57
place to entertain your friends.
46:58
I had the whole Belknap camp, bring as many people as I wanted.
47:02
They all had place to bunk down, so it was a great place.
47:07
But I didn’t have long, I didn’t have a concept of how it was going to be handled.
47:15
That developed with time, over the six years I was in there.
47:19
When I left, I had quite a concept as what I’d like to see, but I didn’t to begin
47:26
with.
47:29
[Peter Homann]
47:32
Was there any consideration of soils and forest nutrition
47:36
in the experiment station?
47:38
Yes, we had Bob Tarrant, who was a soil man who did some soils
47:44
work on Andrews, several times.
47:50
And I think most of it’s published.
47:54
Anything particular that you were…?
47:56
No, that was about the time that I’m aware that some of the work in Washington
48:02
state got started with regard to forest soils, before that there wasn’t too much.
48:05
Well, Tarrant came on to the staff about the 1947, 47, about that.
48:15
And he was a soils man, and that’s when that started.
48:20
I wouldn’t be surprised if it outdated some of the work you’re talking about.
48:26
He was contemporaneous with Stan Gessel [U.
48:26
of Washington professor of soil science]
48:26
. [Linda Ashkenas] I was going
48:31
to ask you
48:37
what Bruckart
48:40
did when his records were threatened [crowd laughs], but
48:42
I was sort of curious to know.
48:44
Nowadays, when we have heavy rain storms and streams start flooding,
48:48
we see increase in sediment loads and sometimes debris torrents and all those
48:53
good sorts of things and I was wondering if similar things happened then?
48:57
Well, most of the time, Lookout Creek, in the winter time, when it
49:01
was high, was colored, but it was a kind of a gray, not many colored.
49:07
But, once in awhile you’d see it brown and there’d be a slide somewhere,
49:11
but not for long, a little while.
49:13
Uh, we could say almost categorically that if we saw any mud in the river that
49:20
it was man-caused, someone was putting it in the river, doing something wrong.
49:26
And well, we eliminated, we virtually eliminated that during
49:29
the years that, uh, the years I was in sales, there wasn’t much mud.
49:36
As far as, commenting on Bruckart, I think he was responsible
49:41
in starting the environmental
49:50
movement [crowd
49:53
laughs].
49:54
Roy,
49:57
two real good theories that you sounded on that I’ve really been interested in.
50:01
One of them was kind of a management style for the Forest where you would
50:07
propose to divide the forest up into good size parcels and then put maybe
50:13
one man in charge of each parcel.
50:15
Can you expand on that?
50:17
If I was managing the Forest that is exactly what I’d do.
50:20
You just about covered it [crowd laughs].
50:23
Yeah, Uh.
50:24
What would be the advantage of that?
50:26
Well, as far as I’m concerned, it would completely change the uh,
50:30
the spirit of the Forest Service.
50:36
When the Forest Service used to just have a district ranger, he
50:40
had big area but he was king.
50:42
He was really king.
50:44
That was the best job in the Forest Service, people that went beyond that
50:48
and became higher [positions] they always wished they were back being a ranger.
50:52
That was because they were able to make all of the decisions on a piece of land.
50:59
They didn’t always know, they didn’t always have the background,
51:04
but they would bring in the background and make the decision.
51:07
And, that to me, and I was, having that kind of,
51:15
situation on the Andrews and I could see where we were so much more
51:19
flexible and could do things with so much more detail than could be
51:23
done in any of the districts, and I wondered why this pattern wasn’t
51:31
even proposed.
51:34
I think the Forest Service would the, rest of the organization would be serving
51:41
as sort of staff, that, if you needed any expert in soils or silviculture
51:46
or any other thing that the district, this person didn’t have information
51:53
on, then it should be available within the Forest Service or for hire.
51:57
And that he should have to pay for it so that he wouldn’t be just able to use
52:06
anything he wanted, it would be economic.
52:10
And I think you would find that he would be able to make all the
52:14
decisions on a piece of land.
52:17
I don’t, people in the regional office, when I posed this, [they] said, “Oh,
52:22
we couldn’t train our people to do this.” Ha-ha-ha, I laughed at them.
52:26
I said you know I didn’t have any training at all and I’m doing it…alright.
52:32
Now, you said there was another one or?
52:34
You said, you talked about if the Forest Service had been able to recognize that
52:40
we were destroying our 300-year-old, old-growth ecosystem, if we had been
52:44
able to recognize that and established a cutting cycle on a 300-year-old rotation
52:50
rather than a 100-year-old rotation.
52:53
Yeah, as far as I’m concerned, a lot of the problems that are associated
52:59
with the controversy today would be lessened or even disappeared, if you had
53:06
the forest organized everywhere as an array of age classes, not necessarily
53:16
even amounts of every age class, but some array of proportion going
53:22
out in time at least over 300 years.
53:28
Alright.
53:28
I’m interested in getting a little more information about the early
53:35
days of the three small watersheds.
53:38
When were the flumes put in, and who helped you, and who laid out
53:44
the watersheds to begin with?
53:50
The first sale that I
53:57
laid out covered the three watersheds, and it would have been an awful sale
54:02
because I had planned a road up the first watershed that went up to about where it
54:08
started up steeply and then curved back [and] came around the point went into
54:12
the second watershed and finally got up to the landings on the third watershed.
54:17
Imagine that!
54:19
Anyway, I, we put it up for sale, and the
54:28
buyers came out and looked at it and all turned it down, fortunately.
54:34
Because when the access road got a little further into the drainage I was
54:39
able to come back into the same area with a very easy road at mid-level and
54:46
it eliminated most of those problems.
54:50
Well, you wouldn’t have the watershed you had now.
54:55
As far as installations,
54:59
the Portland office did
55:04
the planning for those wiers.
55:10
They
55:13
sent the materials to put in.
55:18
I had a contractor who did the concrete work.
55:22
By that time, the access road had passed all three watersheds.
55:27
Even though it wasn’t graveled,
55:31
you could drive in there.
55:33
What year was
55:43
that?
55:44
I would say about 1950.
55:49
Were the first cuts chain saws?
55:54
Yeah, chain saws.
55:59
Well, I think we could go around a few more times, but maybe to just close up…
56:06
Yeah, I’ll come back, this is easy [crowd laughs].
56:09
To just close up, can you make some comments on what
56:13
you knew about H. J. Andrews
56:17
as a person?
56:19
Fine person.
56:19
You know, at my level I didn’t have much contact with him.
56:25
He visited the area twice.
56:28
And uh,
56:31
he was scheduled to become the chief of the Forest Service.
56:34
Went back to Washington, had an auto accident and was killed.
56:41
I remember some of the conversations with him about how interested
56:48
he was in good research.
56:52
You know, if he had, I’m sure if he had, he had
56:58
been there longer, that some of this problem with the Willamette would
57:03
have disappeared, because I think he would have said this is foolish.
57:07
He regional forester at the time?
57:09
He was regional forester up to about the time that Blue
57:16
River was set aside, about ’48.
57:19
Then he went back to Washington and was killed and they dedicated
57:23
the forest a few years later.
57:25
How
57:28
much sign of trails were there other than uh, trails you see H.J.A
57:33
crews or Forest Service had built, was there signs of native trails.
57:37
No, no signs.
57:37
Just game trails.
57:41
There were no roads or trails in that area.
57:44
So, there was never a trail that went up Lookout Creek?
57:47
Just when the road was built?
57:48
No, no.
57:50
Would people go up there fishing at all?
57:52
Well, they would walk up the right away for the public, you know,
57:58
access road, and then they would go up the river, go up the stream.
58:04
Often times, when we were going into the area we would prefer to go up
58:08
the rocky falls stream instead of the woods because of the wind fall.
58:13
Did you run into people while you were camping?
58:14
No!
58:15
Well, no there was, soon as you’d get half a mile beyond the
58:19
road, you don’t find anybody.
58:20
[Art McKee] There was active boys camp in Blue River that was operated in the
58:28
20s and early 50s…Phil Ramhaf [?] was a neighbor of mine for awhile and he
58:35
professed that he used to take his troops up, they would walk up Blue
58:40
River two stages and ending up camping somewhere near Lookout Creek and heading
58:44
back out and making sort of a four or five-day trip out of it, and he said
58:49
they never saw anybody up in there.
58:51
No, I’d be surprised if they did.
58:54
Uh, but the trail was always there and if you had horses you could go around
58:59
that whole loop in two days, easy.
59:04
Roy, did you ever use horses?
59:06
No, we had, we had things packed in with pack animals, but we never used horses.
59:12
No, it wasn’t practical.
59:14
Were there may beavers in the streams?
59:18
Not many, no, no.
59:19
Uh-uh.
59:19
Was there a lot of alder?
59:23
Not much, no, the fires had burned right down to the streams and it was
59:30
old-growth fir right down to the streams.
59:32
In fact, when you look at the old photos, it’s just a line there
59:36
of, you can see the river through.
59:43
They just recently picked up some 1940’s aerial photographs that
59:47
Luna [?] and I were just looking at and it’s incredible the stream, the
59:50
riveting huge trees along the stream.
59:52
Oh yeah, the biggest trees were down there.
59:58
So, when was it that they finally got a road up there?
1:00:02
Uh, the access road was built between ’48 and ’49, it
1:00:08
was built up past the three watersheds.
1:00:14
And then it was a little easier.
1:00:19
Well, how big were the fish that you caught?
1:00:21
[Crowd laughs].
1:00:22
I never caught very big fish out of.
1:00:25
We would fish, we would fish every evening to get some trout, but they
1:00:30
were, by the time you got up to the upper part, 8-inch fish would be
1:00:35
a pretty good fish, 9 inch, maybe.
1:00:41
Roy, thank you very much for coming by.
1:00:43
It has been very interested to me and, I can tell by the level of attentiveness,
1:00:49
we all appreciate it a great deal and would like to hear some more.
1:00:52
Well this is a great format.
1:00:53
Yeah
1:00:56
this was a great idea, yeah.
1:00:56
Yeah [Crowd cheers].
