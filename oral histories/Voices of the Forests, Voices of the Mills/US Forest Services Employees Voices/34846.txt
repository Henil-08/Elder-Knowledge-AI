00:02
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University,
00:06
College of Forestry, Forest Ecosystems and Society Department.
00:11
I am here in the Forest Science Laboratory, U.S. Forest Service Forest
00:15
Science Laboratory with Dr. Eric Forsman, Emeritus Research Wildlife Biologist, who
00:22
was with the Forest Service for 35 years.
00:25
Not quite that long.
00:27
I went to work full-time for the Forest Service in 1987 and I retired in
00:35
2016, no, I’m sorry, 2015.
00:38
Yeah.
00:39
What we are here doing an oral history interview that is centered
00:44
on the Northwest Forest Plan and Eric’s involvement in that, but
00:48
not necessarily limited to that.
00:49
We’re going to also have some biographical background as we weave through his life
00:53
story leading up to that main subject.
00:54
This is part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project that is being
00:59
funded by the Pacific Northwest Research Station of the U.S. Forest Service.
01:03
Anyway, Eric, good afternoon.
01:05
Good afternoon.
01:06
Thank you for being willing to meet with me.
01:08
I’m happy to be here.
01:09
Anyway, I always start the interviews the same way, just basically, to ask
01:14
where were you born and raised, and for you to give a biographical sketch
01:17
of how it [career] all started out.
01:21
Well, where I was born and raised is kind of a complex question,
01:24
because my mother is from Oregon.
01:27
Her parents came here on wagon trains, and so her family, you know,
01:32
harkens back to the mid-1800’s.
01:35
My dad was a carpenter, but he was in the Navy in World War II.
01:41
When he retired, they mustered him out here in Oregon.
01:46
He met my mother on a blind date here in Oregon.
01:54
They ended up going to Alabama, which is
02:01
where my dad was from, and I was born there.
02:03
They stayed there for like two or three years, and moved back
02:07
here when I was four years old.
02:09
So I take it, you don’t remember a whole lot about the Deep South.
02:12
Right?
02:12
No, I don’t remember much about the Deep South, but I’m
02:14
so glad I wasn’t raised there.
02:17
I’m glad they came back to Oregon and I grew up down in Eugene.
02:20
But think about it, you would have many national championships in football.
02:23
I might have, but I suspect, if I had grown up in Alabama, I would
02:27
have turned out to be a very different person than I am, so
02:30
-- That’s possible.
02:31
Anyway, but where in Oregon did you grow up?
02:33
Okay, my mother was from Springfield.
02:37
Her people were from that area.
02:38
Okay.
02:38
And so, when they moved back from Alabama, when I was like four,
02:43
we settled in Springfield, lived there just for a couple of years.
02:47
My dad then bought a farm out on the outskirts of Eugene, a
02:52
seven-acre strawberry farm, out where the Beltline Highway is at now.
02:59
None of those highways were there.
03:00
It was a bunch of gravel pits and farm land and bean fields.
03:03
But were you close to the river?
03:04
We were fairly close to the Willamette River, yeah.
03:07
We were just kind of a little bit east of the Willamette.
03:11
What they call the Delta area now?
03:13
Delta Ponds were right in our back yard.
03:16
When we moved there, those ponds weren’t there.
03:20
The gravel company bought all that property, a lot of it at that time was
03:23
agricultural, and proceeded to start mining gravel out of those ponds.
03:28
So, all those ponds when I was a kid, were just being dug up.
03:32
Do you remember when you were warned to not swim in the Willamette
03:35
River because it was too polluted?
03:37
I don’t remember that so much.
03:39
You don’t remember that?
03:39
My mother was scared to death we were going to drown out there because we were
03:42
always out on the ponds in our boats, and we made boats and canoes and things,
03:48
trapping out on the sloughs around there.
03:52
But I had five brothers, there were six boys, and somehow,
03:57
we all survived that era.
03:59
But yeah, that was
04:01
-- Now, was your family involved in the timber industry in any way?
04:05
You’re from Springfield, so that’s why that would be an obvious question.
04:08
Not at that time.
04:11
I mean, my mother’s dad and quite a few of her relatives were farmers and loggers.
04:18
My grandfather, for example, worked for a while in the logging industry.
04:21
He was mainly a farmer, but they were sort of peripherally-involved.
04:26
My dad’s family, not at all.
04:31
Dad was a carpenter.
04:32
So, he used wood, but was not involved in the timber industry per se.
04:36
And so, I guess I would say, not particularly involved in the industry.
04:44
A lot of my brothers ended up being involved in the timber industry.
04:47
My brother Tom, has been a timber buyer/seller all of his
04:52
life, working in the industry.
04:54
And my brother Richard, was the bridge and building foreman for Burlington
04:58
Northern Railroad, so, he has been involved in transporting lumber or
05:03
working with lumber all his life.
05:05
My brother Joe,
05:08
has owned a cedar mill over in Florence for pretty much his entire professional
05:13
life, and he still owns that little mill and sells roofing products.
05:19
My brother Pete, was a carpenter.
05:22
Let’s see, my brother Steve, worked in the mill down at, oh, gosh, I
05:27
want to say, was it Sutherland?
05:30
Anyway, it’s a plywood mill.
05:33
His job was a plugger.
05:34
He put plugs in plywood all day long.
05:37
So, yeah, you know, all of them.
05:39
Do you remember Midgley’s Millwork and Glass in Eugene?
05:42
Oh, yeah, yes.
05:43
That was my family’s for 80 years.
05:44
Oh, okay.
05:45
We bought it from George Midgley back in World War I, my great-grandfather
05:49
Sam, who I was named after.
05:51
Wow, okay, yeah.
05:53
So, some of our relatives probably crossed paths.
05:55
Probably.
05:57
Or bought stuff from each other.
05:58
Yeah, yep.
05:59
So, anyway, cool.
06:00
So, now,
06:04
you told me about you had some favorite places right by home there, the ponds
06:08
where you probably fished and swam, and went in boats and things like that.
06:11
But in terms of out beyond the valley, what places do you remember
06:16
being especially impactful on how you saw nature, the Northwest, favorite
06:22
places and experiences either in the mountains or the coast, or wherever?
06:27
Oh gosh.
06:28
Well, growing up, we didn’t travel much.
06:31
Mostly, dad was so busy making a living trying to raise six kids and keep his
06:37
head above water, that he worked a lot.
06:42
You know, he’d work during the week as a carpenter.
06:44
He’d come home on the weekends and evenings and build houses.
06:47
All the houses we lived in growing up, from the time I was probably, well,
06:51
from the time I can remember, he built.
06:53
He bought this old farm, and we lived in this rickety-old farm house, probably
06:59
built in the, I don’t know, ‘40s, with a wood stove and no insulation in the walls.
07:04
And while we were living in that house, dad built a house next-door.
07:09
This was about 1960
07:12
or so, he built a nice, single-story farm-style house.
07:17
We tore down the old farm house, and moved into the new house.
07:21
While we were living in that house, he shortly thereafter started
07:24
building another house next to it.
07:26
He subdivided the property, and built that house.
07:30
We moved, sold the original house, and moved into the next one.
07:33
We did that three times.
07:35
He built, so we didn’t have a lot of time to do much traveling.
07:40
The things I remember are like, for example, Dad took us a couple of times up
07:47
to the Erma Bell Lakes, which is down on the south end of the Blue River District
07:51
there between Blue River and Oak Ridge.
07:54
And we’d hike back into the Erma Bells and fish.
07:57
It’s kind of on the south side of the Three Sisters Wilderness Area?
08:00
It’s on the south and west, yeah.
08:02
Southwest side, yeah.
08:03
Yes, close to French Pete, or south of French Pete.
08:06
I can remember going with my grandfather up to Leaburg and fishing
08:10
for trout in Leaburg Reservoir.
08:11
You know, nothing very fancy.
08:14
What we called “water-board park.” [Eugene Water and Electric Board has hydroelectric
08:16
power plant connected to dam/reservoir.]
08:17
Yeah, yeah.
08:17
Right.
08:18
So those were some of the early experiences I had.
08:21
But mostly, I and my brothers, but I think particularly me, spent a lot of time
08:30
just running around the forests and urban areas where I grew up there in Eugene.
08:37
At that time, it was all farm land, sloughs and gravel pits by the river.
08:39
If you go there now, it’s all a bunch of subdivisions.
08:41
And
08:48
I grew up trapping and fishing and hunting, thinking I wanted
08:51
to be a trapper in Alaska.
08:53
If you’d asked me when I was twelve-years-old what I was going to do,
08:56
I probably would have said, “I’m going to Alaska to be a trapper.” Because
09:02
in those years, I thought mainly about harvesting things.
09:06
I was always fishing.
09:07
I was always out during the winter, and I would run a trap line.
09:12
So, it was a pretty rural existence growing up.
09:16
And I really just liked being out in the woods in nature doing stuff.
09:24
Even right in the middle of the Willamette Valley?
09:26
Well, yeah, but like I said, at that time
09:28
-- It was much wilder back then.
09:32
Like all that area where I grew up, it was a bunch of bean fields.
09:36
There were old hop yards, there was a lot of agriculture.
09:43
In fact, my brothers and I all had summer jobs working picking beans,
09:47
picking cherries, picking strawberries.
09:48
That’s how we made school money to pay for clothes going to school.
09:53
But, it was a
09:59
pretty wild area just in terms of a lot of sloughs and rivers and forests along
10:05
those areas where a kid could run a trap line or shoot ducks or fish for bass.
10:11
That’s the kind of stuff we did.
10:12
And for me, that gradually changed as I got older and got into high school.
10:18
I became more interested in kind of watching things than trying to kill them.
10:23
But how and why do you think that transformation took place?
10:29
Oh, I don’t know.
10:30
I think I
10:34
was always kind of interested in animals and trying to learn about what they did.
10:45
But I had a couple of teachers along the way that influenced me.
10:57
Did you go to North Eugene or South [Eugene]
10:58
? I went to Sheldon.
10:59
[High School]
10:59
Sheldon, excuse me.
11:00
Yeah.
11:00
I was the first class that went all the way through Sheldon
11:03
High School, and graduated in
11:09
’66.
11:09
He gave us a project where we had to go out and observe something
11:14
and write a report on it.
11:16
I went out in a gravel pit and watched ducks or something, I can’t even
11:19
remember now, but we had to do that.
11:23
That kind of all of a sudden made me realize that maybe I might think
11:29
about doing something other than trapping and trying to kill something.
11:32
I might think about a career of trying to actually study
11:35
something and learn about it.
11:38
Then I had another teacher at Lane Community College, when
11:41
I went to Lane for two years.
11:44
In fact, he’s still alive.
11:45
I saw him the other day, Herb Wisner.
11:53
This is shortly after LCC opened, about two or three years later?
11:57
Well, I don’t remember exactly.
11:58
We were in a little shack over in Springfield.
12:03
Oh, okay.
12:04
They had these little campus places all over.
12:06
So, they didn’t even have the whole main campus?
12:08
No, they had a bunch of little offices all over the place, some
12:12
in Springfield, some in Eugene.
12:14
I went to the one over in Springfield.
12:16
It was kind of out there by where the mill sites were.
12:19
What about this biology class you took?
12:21
Yeah, it was just your basic biology, college entry-level biology class.
12:26
And again,
12:31
I was already kind of gravitating in that direction, I think.
12:34
But he was just a good instructor, and again, gave us projects where we had to
12:39
go out and do things and write reports.
12:42
And
12:45
on top of that, my mother was interested in birds.
12:48
And so, I think when I was still in high school, she kind of infected me with
12:53
the “bird nut” disease a little bit.
12:55
Did you have some classic, maybe Audubon books in your house, or you
13:02
read some classic piece of literature or saw some of the great art works like
13:06
in the Audubon books, for instance, that made an impression on you?
13:09
I don’t remember that, you know, I just kind of got interested in watching
13:17
birds, just because they were cool.
13:18
They were interesting.
13:23
In high school, I think probably about my senior year, I got
13:27
really interested in owls.
13:29
And I don’t really know what it was that turned me on to them.
13:31
I think it was because in our neighborhood we had lots of great-horned owls.
13:35
In these sloughs and gravel pits, there are great-horneds all over the place.
13:39
And every spring you’d hear them calling all over the place.
13:42
And so, I started looking for nests and I actually found a couple.
13:47
I remember, in my second year at Lane Community College, I found a nest
13:55
right back behind our house, and I mentioned it to one of my instructors,
14:01
and we ended up going back there.
14:03
I drug him out in the field along with a couple other people.
14:06
I can’t remember who they were now, a couple bird nuts.
14:09
And I climbed to the nest, and we banded the chicks in that nest.
14:15
I remember getting whacked in the head by the female.
14:18
In fact, it was one of the hardest hits I ever took from an owl.
14:22
But anyway, I was kind of leaning in that direction.
14:26
Obviously, yes.
14:27
I got kind of fired up about birds, particularly owls.
14:31
And I don’t remember reading any particular literature.
14:35
Because even cartoons, they depict owls as wise figures.
14:38
You know
14:41
where I’m going with this.
14:42
No, I don’t remember any of that.
14:44
I just remember getting interested in these birds that hunted at night
14:50
and were kind of these mysterious critters that most people didn’t
14:54
see or relate to particularly.
15:01
At that time, I was reading bird books.
15:03
I kept seeing and reading about spotted owls in bird books and was thinking, “Oh,
15:08
they’re here somewhere in Oregon,” and really wanting to see one, but I didn’t.
15:14
I was
15:18
a kid in high school without a lot of transportation.
15:21
I just kind of read about them and was curious about them.
15:24
And I knew that they were out there in the forests in Oregon, but at that
15:29
time, nobody knew anything about them.
15:31
They were just rarely ever seen.
15:36
When I first got interested in spotted owls, there were like only
15:39
twenty-eight previous sightings of spotted owls in Oregon, period.
15:44
And most of those were just somebody happened to be out in the woods and
15:47
saw one sitting there or something.
15:50
There were no known nests.
15:52
Well, they’re pretty high up, most of them?
15:54
No, they’re down right in front of you.
15:57
Oh, what’s their average height?
15:59
You mean, well, above the ground?
16:00
Yeah.
16:01
In the summer time, they’re roosting right down ten feet off the ground.
16:04
Okay, okay.
16:04
If it’s warm, they roost really low in the forest canopy, so they’re hard to miss.
16:09
But,
16:12
up until that time, people, bird-type folks, didn’t spend a lot of time
16:18
out there in the old-growth forest.
16:19
I’m sure the loggers saw them occasionally.
16:22
But there were just very few published records.
16:25
There had never been a nest located in Oregon.
16:28
There was one case where
16:34
someone
16:37
saw juvenile spotted owls down near Trail, Oregon,
16:49
but that was the only known case of observed reproduction in Oregon, when I
16:54
first started getting interested in them.
16:56
So, that just really intrigued me, being interested in owls and then knowing
17:02
that there was this species out there we didn’t know diddly-squat about.
17:05
So, how would you describe the time before your professional career really
17:08
started and let’s take it up through your community college days, and that
17:11
will be your point of reference there.
17:12
But before that time, and obviously, you’re coming at it now from a
17:15
perspective of a career ornithologist essentially, or wildlife biologist.
17:21
How would you see the evolution of ornithology and how birds were studied
17:27
up until that point in the ‘60s when you started to become interested?
17:31
Well, let me back up a little bit, too.
17:34
In terms of my career, when I was a young kid, I thought I was going
17:39
to be a trapper and end up spending my life hunting and trapping.
17:44
By the time I got into high school, I also was interested in flying.
17:50
And I ended up getting my private pilot’s license when I was sixteen.
17:55
It was in 1964.
18:02
I was a junior in high school.
18:04
For a while, I thought I was going to try to go on and be an aerobatic pilot,
18:09
which is what I really liked doing.
18:12
You wanted to do shows and stuff?
18:13
Yeah, or I was going to end up getting a commercial license
18:17
and be a commercial pilot.
18:19
And so, the way I did that, I had a summer job working at Staff
18:25
Jennings boat shop down in Eugene.
18:29
And I think I was making a buck-and-a-quarter an
18:31
hour when I left there.
18:33
But I would take the money I had made working at the boat
18:36
yard in evenings and weekends.
18:54
And to fly the airplane that I was flying, cost like three dollars and
18:59
fifty-some cents an hour to fly it.
19:02
So, I’d work a few hours in the boat yard and make enough to go fly
19:04
for an hour, and go out and fly.
19:07
So, I started gradually accumulating hours in the airplane
19:11
and got my pilot’s license.
19:13
And so, that was another thing I thought about doing for a while.
19:15
Then, my dad being a carpenter, I also spent a lot of time
19:20
working with him building houses.
19:22
And for a while, I thought, “Oh, maybe I’ll just be a carpenter,” because
19:26
I knew I could make a living doing that. So, I had all these sort of
19:29
conflicting [laughs] careers that I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.
19:33
But there were some common threads here that led to you studying things that fly.
19:38
But, well, I guess, yeah, I don’t know.
19:41
But,
19:43
the flying thing was a lot of fun, but it was also very expensive.
19:50
I can do the math.
19:51
$1.25 an hour and $3.50, that’s—
19:53
Well, if you’d been a rich kid growing up in a rich family, maybe
19:56
you’d have had some support to help pay for going on and getting a
20:00
commercial license, things like that.
20:01
I didn’t have that.
20:02
That’s pretty expensive to get one of those.
20:04
It was expensive and my folks had more pressing concerns than paying for it.
20:07
Well, with six kids.
20:08
Yeah, so I ended up, gradually just in terms of my schooling, getting kind
20:15
of sidetracked into the biology realm, and that’s kind of where I went, once I
20:18
got in there, but I still kept flying.
20:22
In fact, I still do fly with my son.
20:24
But, it’s a hobby, it’s not something that I do for a career.
20:30
So, I kind of ended up going the biology route.
20:34
But, you asked about just in terms of ornithology.
20:39
What was your question?
20:40
Oh, it’s okay, don’t worry, I mean, we can return to these themes.
20:43
But my question was, in referencing how you said that the spotted owl, very little
20:48
was known about it, and is couched in the broader historical vector of ornithology
20:56
in general and what was being studied?
21:01
Like, you can stay in the Northwest, or not?
21:04
What was the interest of the discipline, let’s say, up until
21:07
the time you got involved?
21:10
Well, I mean, an awful lot of what had been done up until that time was
21:16
sort of natural history kinds of work.
21:19
It’s only more recently that we’ve gotten into genetics and
21:26
more quantitative kinds of work.
21:29
A lot of what had been done up until that time, particularly with owls, was
21:33
natural history, and describing diets or describing home ranges or behavior.
21:40
Descriptive narratives?
21:42
Descriptive kinds of studies, right.
21:45
For the most part, not particularly quantitative.
21:47
There had been quite a bit of work [on some topics] . McArthur had
21:50
published his paper on resource partitioning between song birds in the
21:56
forest canopy and things like that.
21:58
So, there had been some fairly quantitative work published like that.
22:05
There had been a fair amount of work done on water fowl population biology,
22:12
more quantitative kinds of stuff.
22:14
But
22:17
much of what had been done was more descriptive, more natural history kind
22:22
of work, which is what I really liked.
22:25
I liked trying to figure out these little mysteries about what owls ate,
22:32
or how big their home ranges were, or what kinds of habitat they used.
22:39
And this is from the very start, before you were really trained, correct?
22:42
Yeah, those were the kind of things that really intrigued me.
22:45
While I was still in high school, I was collecting great horned owl pellets,
22:50
dragging them home and cleaning owl pellets on the table of the kitchen.
22:54
So, I remember, I was doing that one time and we had somebody
23:00
visit, I forget who it was.
23:01
I think it was Harvey Waldron’s dad, who was
23:07
a professor at a community college in Bend, if I remember right.
23:12
He stood there and watched me do that at the table, and he said, “You know, that’s
23:16
the kind of work that people do when they’re working on scientific studies of
23:21
species like that.” And I thought, “Oh, that’s interesting and kind of cool.” So,
23:29
those were the kind of things that really intrigued me, more so than doing hard
23:34
science where you’re doing a control and
23:39
a treatment, and looking at cause-and-effect.
23:42
So, you looked at it from the beginning anyway in a semi-inductive way.
23:47
In other words, you went out and gathered this information experientially,
23:52
visually, etc., and then you tried to create the model from that?
23:56
Yeah, these were very much observational kinds of studies, as opposed to
24:02
hard – [quantitative studies]
24:04
It’s kind of how historians, how we do stuff.
24:06
We gather all this stuff and then we see what that tells us.
24:08
Yeah, which is what a lot of biology has been.
24:12
Much of what I’ve done has certainly been that way, as opposed to going out
24:15
and setting up an experiment where you have a hypothesis, you do a treatment,
24:20
measure, have a control, and you then look at the cause-and-effect.
24:25
We’ve done some of that
24:28
more recently.
24:29
But much of what I did with spotted owls was purely observational kinds
24:35
of studies, where you collect a bunch of data, run statistics, and try to
24:41
determine what’s important and what’s not.
24:46
Now, do you remember anything that you saw, witnessed, or experienced in nature,
24:53
whether it’s in the Willamette Valley, up in the Cascades, at the coast, what have
24:57
you, where you witnessed something that was involved with how natural resources
25:04
were being managed that made an impression on you, negatively or positively?
25:08
Yeah.
25:15
I didn’t really notice this early on, but certainly by the time I was in college, I
25:22
spent a lot of time out in the woods.
25:26
Once I got wheels, got a car, and developed some friendships with other
25:32
biologists, or other budding biologists, we spent a lot of time running around
25:37
Oregon out in the woods or out in the desert, banding prairie falcons, that
25:43
sort of thing, and it became very obvious to me very early on that we were
25:51
cutting our forests very, very rapidly.
25:55
And that had a huge—
25:56
And this would have been in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, right?
25:58
Yes, yeah.
25:59
The peak of industrial forestry, or thereabouts.
26:01
Close.
26:01
Well, actually, I think the volumes kept increasing into the early ‘80s.
26:06
Correct.
26:08
But, yeah, those early years of running around all over western Oregon and in
26:14
the deserts of eastern Oregon, really had a big effect on me, just seeing
26:20
the landscapes changing so rapidly.
26:24
Seeing extensive areas being harvested.
26:26
I mean, the H.J. Andrews is
26:30
a classic example.
26:31
I was up there working in that area for the Blue River
26:37
District from 1967 through ’69.
26:41
I came back and worked on a masters and Ph.D. up there part of the
26:45
time, and they were harvesting on the Andrews pretty rapidly.
26:48
And Watershed 1 is a classic example; there’s a 200-acre clear-cut.
26:51
Well, they harvested all the way up into the ‘80s.
26:53
[Clearcutting on Andrews Forest was greatly curtailed by the 1970s.]
26:54
Yeah, and they were planning on harvesting a lot more of it.
26:57
The plan was to cut a lot of that.
26:59
And so, in fact, to me, it’s remarkable to go up there now and drive those
27:05
roads and not be able to see anything.
27:07
Back in the ‘60s and ‘70s, you could see all over the place because
27:12
you were driving through these big clear-cuts, and you could see
27:15
the ridges and see the landscape.
27:17
Now, you drive up there, and you’re driving through a sea of second growth,
27:19
young forest, and you can’t see out.
27:22
It’s very different.
27:23
What specific things bothered when you were thinking that
27:27
this is not sustainable?
27:29
What were the particulars?
27:30
I mean, obviously, you were a bird guy and you were an animal guy.
27:34
Was it like the little furry creatures of the forest are all getting
27:37
killed, or what was your impression?
27:39
That was kind of the latter.
27:42
Back in those days, I really wasn’t thinking in terms of sustainability,
27:46
so much as I was thinking, “God, these are places where spotted owls
27:50
live, and they are cutting the heck out of it very rapidly. And we have
27:57
no idea what the effect is in terms of how these species are responding.”
28:01
That was kind of my gut reaction, as I’m driving all over the Blue River
28:06
District, and there’s just clear-cuts everywhere. You can’t go anywhere without
28:10
hearing a yarder whistle, literally.
28:13
And we have no idea about all these species that are living out there.
28:21
At the time, I was thinking particularly of spotted owls, because
28:23
that’s the one that got me fired up.
28:25
But, I kept thinking, “Wow, if we keep this up, we’re probably going to lose
28:32
these things and we won’t even know.”
28:34
As you were being trained, starting from community college through your
28:39
eventual undergrad, master’s and Ph.D., do you remember reading about American
28:44
environmental history, and, shall we say, cases of extinctions and other events in
28:49
the past as you were becoming trained?
28:52
Well, I think where it really hit home was when I first read Aldo
28:57
Leopold’s Sand County Almanac.
29:00
And that probably was my first year at OSU, in ’68, I guess.
29:06
Which essay do you remember made the biggest impact?
29:09
I mean, there’s a bunch of them in there.
29:10
Oh, man, yeah, I don’t know, if it’s “Thinking Like a Mountain” or
29:14
whatever, but yeah, all of them.
29:20
I don’t know if you’ve read it, but his “Ode to the Passenger Pigeon,”
29:27
published in a separate little book, is gut-wrenching.
29:32
I
29:35
think that more than anything else, got to me for some reason.
29:41
I read a lot of other stuff in those years, but that really
29:45
kind of brought me around.
29:51
So, take me through your education.
29:54
Now, you touched on LCC briefly.
29:56
You said that you took a biology class.
29:58
Do you want to say a little bit about that mentor, but especially your undergrad
30:03
and even graduate studies, and tell me about how your studies progressed, how
30:08
you became focused on certain things, and who were your most important mentors?
30:14
Again,
30:18
I think by my senior year in high school, I definitely was
30:22
thinking about a career in biology.
30:27
And beginning to realize I was a horrible student in high school, I just never
30:30
quite knew what I was going to do.
30:33
Did you play sports, too?
30:34
Not really.
30:35
No?
30:35
I was a runner in junior college, but in high school, no.
30:38
I was kind of a loner.
30:39
I kind of did my own thing.
30:40
In fact, I hung out mostly with adults in high school.
30:44
I hung out with bird folks from the local Audubon chapter like Larry
30:50
McQueen, who was a pretty famous artist.
30:52
He still lives in Eugene.
30:54
I hung out with Larry and Herb Wisner and some of the bird guys from Portland.
30:58
We went on Christmas bird counts with these guys.
31:04
In high school, I think it was senior year I took this biology course,
31:08
from, I think it was Mr. Favier.
31:10
That was his name.
31:12
At Sheldon?
31:13
At Sheldon, yeah, and I really enjoyed that class.
31:17
I liked going out and doing this little study we had to do.
31:20
You know, it’s just something, I thought, “Hey, this is fun.” This keeps me out
31:23
in the woods and, you know, it was cool. I got to Lane Community College,
31:28
and again, at that point I decided to major in biology. This was in 1966
31:37
through ’68.
31:38
I was there at Lane Community two years.
31:41
And took mainly biology courses.
31:43
In
31:49
those two years, I was also working summers up on the Blue River District
31:53
to make money to pay for my college.
31:56
I was on trail crews and recreation crews,
32:01
then transferred to OSU in 1968, and was there until 1970.
32:07
I was there two years, for my junior and senior years, in the wildlife program.
32:14
Once I got up here, I had a number of mentors in Fish and Wildlife,
32:20
old Professor Kuhn and Jay Long, were kind of the old-timers over
32:24
there, and other cool, old dudes.
32:25
There were many big-game type biologists, not particularly
32:29
interested in non-game forest wildlife.
32:33
In fact, I remember Jay Long in front of one of the classes I took.
32:37
About old-growth forests, he said, “They’re a biological desert.” [Laughs]
32:42
Which was kind of the stereotype at the time, right?
32:42
Yeah,
32:45
because there’s no deer and elk in those forests.
32:48
Quite a narrow, humanistic perspective.
32:52
But the other professor that I interacted with then was Howard White, who was
32:58
head of the Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit over in Fish and Wildlife.
33:03
I started talking to Howard about spotted owls because I was interested
33:09
in them, and I mentioned to Howard
33:16
there was this species out here that we really don’t know anything
33:19
about, you know, this owl.
33:21
And he kind of perked up, because Howard at that time was one of
33:26
the first biologists here to get interested in non-game forests,
33:33
or non-game wildlife, particularly as they related to old growth.
33:37
He was interested in cavity-nesting woodpeckers, for example.
33:40
He was interested in things like that, and that there was concern that cavity-nesters
33:48
might be negatively impacted by harvest and conversions to young forest.
33:54
Then I started to talking to him about this owl that nested in big
33:56
cavities, and he really got interested.
33:58
And
34:00
I don’t remember talking to him so much about a graduate project,
34:03
it was just talking about this interesting owl and the fact that
34:07
we didn’t know anything about it.
34:10
At the same time, I met Richard Reynolds and Chris Maser.
34:16
Chris was a grad student then, and a little older than I was.
34:21
Richard had just come back from Vietnam and was interested in
34:27
goshawks and accipiters, forest birds.
34:33
I started running around with those guys, and they were a little older
34:36
than I was, but very much mentors.
34:40
They had more experience than I had, they had a little more.
34:44
In terms of Reynolds, he’d been off and fought in a war, and come back.
34:48
So,
34:50
I looked up to those guys.
34:53
But they were also very interested in what I was interested in.
34:56
Chris Maser was a tree vole maniac.
34:58
So, that was your entry to tree voles?
35:01
Because you became interested in those later, too.
35:03
Yep, Chris really was interested in tree voles.
35:05
He was out there collecting trees voles and writing his master’s thesis, but he
35:10
didn’t particularly like to climb trees.
35:14
I liked climbing trees, so I would go out with Chris and
35:16
help him collect tree voles.
35:19
Reynolds, he was just a complete maniac in terms of accipiters.
35:26
He was very interested in goshawks, and he and I ran all over western
35:30
Oregon in those early years.
35:32
This would have been 1969-70, looking for goshawk nests.
35:37
I was trying to find spotted owls.
35:39
I mean, we camped in the snow up at Box Canyon looking for spotted
35:44
owls in the middle of winter.
35:46
We were just all over the place.
35:49
We went over and rappelled off of Fort Rock trying to band prairie
35:53
falcons, with Reynolds and Wes Pike and other guys that I knew.
35:57
So, I ran into a bunch of these guys in college that had similar interests.
36:03
Kindred spirits.
36:04
Kindred spirits.
36:08
That just kind of got me even more fired up about trying to do
36:11
something with spotted owls in terms of a more detailed project.
36:17
And did that really start during your master’s program?
36:20
No, it started as an undergraduate.
36:22
Okay, okay.
36:24
Yeah, it started with Howard White and Richard Reynolds, in particular.
36:27
This would have been ’68, well, ’69-’70, talking to those guys, getting
36:35
Howard fired up about spotted owls.
36:37
And Reynolds and I started actually searching for spotted
36:40
owls together, and finding a few.
36:43
This was, let me back up a little bit.
36:47
Before I really got too involved with, well, actually,
36:53
it was about the same time.
36:54
In 1969, it was my third year working on a summer job for the Forest Service.
36:59
I was up at Box Canyon guard station, stationed there in late summer at the
37:05
peak of the fire season, and going out and driving up and down the roads
37:08
during the day and talking to campers in the campgrounds, hiking into the Erma
37:11
Bell Lakes to check on campers there.
37:14
But I was sitting there in the guard station one evening and I heard
37:19
something “barking” up on the hill, it sounded sort of [makes noise].
37:22
I thought, “That’s a weird-sounding dog.” Then, it began to dawn me that,
37:27
hey, that sounds like what I’ve read about spotted owls do, you know.
37:31
So, this was your first experience?
37:33
That was my first experience.
37:34
It was the call of a spotted owl.
37:35
Yeah, I’d been looking for them for years, not really knowing what I was doing.
37:39
But I’m sitting there on the front porch of the guard station in the
37:42
evening, and all of a sudden they start calling on the hill right above me.
37:45
And I said, “Oh shit, that sounds like a spotted owl.” So, I hiked down the
37:49
road, it was down by the meadow there at the guard station, and they were
37:52
right up on the hill to the west of the meadow there calling. I started
37:58
trying to hoot back at them, and I was pretty much an amateur, but they,
38:02
the spotted owls, respond to almost anything that’s close to their calls.
38:05
And they eventually followed me all the way back to the guard station.
38:08
I had them right there in the trees over the Box Canyon guard station.
38:12
After that, I kept hearing them all summer, off and on.
38:14
They’d call up on the hills around the guard station, and I’d gradually
38:18
practiced calling and gotten better at it.
38:20
And again, this was in 1969.
38:24
So, when I went back to school my senior year, in 1970, ’69-’70, Reynolds and
38:32
I started running around looking for spotted owls, going out and doing calls.
38:36
We’d go up to Tombstone Summit, and found them all up there around Tombstone, over
38:43
just to the east of there on Indian Creek.
38:47
We found out there in McDonald Forest and a couple different sites.
38:51
So, again, this was while I was still an undergraduate.
38:53
What was the literature you had to go on at that time about the spotted owl?
38:59
Very little.
38:59
You know, Gabrielson and Jewett’s Birds of Oregon had a short section in there.
39:03
There were a few published papers.
39:07
Dickey had published a paper in California.
39:09
Joe Marshall had published papers on finding spotted owls in California, and he
39:16
published one on spotted owls in Arizona.
39:19
They were all just little, short papers.
39:21
They found a few pellets, and they looked at the diet.
39:24
Anecdotal?
39:24
Oh, yeah, just observational kinds of stuff.
39:28
But,
39:31
nothing very detailed.
39:34
So, yeah, once we found them and started looking for them, I just got
39:39
really fired up, and started talking more and more to Howard White about
39:43
possibly doing a Master’s study.
39:46
So, I was all primed and ready, but I was also number nine on the draft list.
39:54
And in August of 1970, I got drafted.
39:58
And so, that changed my plans.
40:04
I spent two years in the Army
40:08
as a medic.
40:09
They shipped me over to Germany.
40:11
I spent about thirteen months in Germany working out of a dispensary,
40:17
doing sick call in the morning [screening people asking for medical
40:19
attention] and working on the emergency ward at night occasionally.
40:23
So, I spent two years in the Army.
40:26
But you never went to ‘Nam?
40:29
No.
40:29
They drafted me, and I didn’t volunteer for anything.
40:31
I just went where they sent me, and they sent me to Germany.
40:36
They wasted a whole bunch of money training us.
40:38
Sent me to Germany, and eighteen months into my two-year hitch, they said,
40:44
“We’re giving all you guys an early out.
40:46
We don’t have enough to keep you guys busy.” They sent us back to the States.
40:52
So, I actually spent eighteen months in the Army.
40:56
The last few months, I spent most of my time doing exit physicals for guys that
41:01
got drafted along with me, and getting them processed back out of the Army.
41:06
It was right at the end of Vietnam, and the Army drafted
41:11
way more than they could use.
41:14
During the time in Germany, how did you keep your interest and
41:18
love for birds and biology alive?
41:20
Did you do a little observational stuff over there?
41:25
For someone like me, they couldn’t have hardly sent me to a better place.
41:30
They sent me to a little town, Wildflecken, Germany.
41:37
It’s a small community out in the middle of nowhere in the eastern part
41:44
of West Germany, close to the Czechoslovakian border.
41:48
It’s all forested, with rolling, conifer-covered hills.
41:52
It looks much like western Oregon.
41:55
During the week you’d get up every morning and go pull sick call.
42:00
Sick call is
42:03
when whoever comes in and claims they’re sick, you’ve got to process them, and
42:07
determine that they really are sick.
42:08
You send them to a doctor.
42:10
If they’re not, you give them some aspirin and send them on their way.
42:12
But, I’d do sick call in the morning and then do whatever ward work
42:19
they had in the afternoon, and then your evenings, but particularly
42:22
your weekends, were usually free.
42:25
On
42:27
those weekends, a lot of the guys would go
42:32
drinking, and I would hike the hills around the base.
42:36
I’d take off in the morning and hike ten miles over hill and dale to one of
42:40
the little hostels on the hilltop, where you could have a beer and come back.
42:44
And, so, it was really nice country.
42:47
It had all been logged many, many times.
42:50
The forests were very manicured, but there were still things like the big black
42:54
woodpecker, the Schwarzspecht, and there were owls and all kinds of cool birds.
43:01
I can remember going out at night and calling up the long-eared
43:04
owls out behind the barracks.
43:07
I kind of just got through it by spending as much time as I could
43:12
off-base hiking the hills around
43:16
the base.
43:17
Channeling your inner John Muir.
43:18
I also liked to climb.
43:20
And so, I made one trip with
43:24
a fellow GI, who was also a climber, down to the Alps, and we spent a
43:28
week hiking and climbing in the Alps.
43:31
The Alps in Switzerland?
43:33
We were in Switzerland right on the border with Italy.
43:37
Oh, so you were in the real high stuff then?
43:39
Oh, yeah, we were up in the high Alps.
43:40
Close to Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn and all that?
43:41
Yeah, we were looking right at the Matterhorn.
43:45
We were climbing just down the road a-ways from there.
43:49
So,
43:52
I spent a lot of time running around the mountains and the hills of Germany
43:57
whenever I could get away from the base.
43:58
But
44:00
the whole time I was there, I was corresponding with Richard Reynolds,
44:06
a grad student back at OSU, and with Howard White, and in a couple
44:11
different letters between me and Howard, talking about possibly doing
44:15
a master’s study when I got out.
44:18
Howard was enthusiastic about doing that.
44:21
I had pretty good grades when I was at OSU,
44:26
so he basically said, “Yeah, once you get out, I’ll take you on as a grad student.”
44:31
So, you come back here and you start your masters in ’72?
44:35
I got out in March of ’72, in April of 1972, I was in the
44:39
field doing spotted owl surveys.
44:41
So, you didn’t wait at all?
44:42
I didn’t have time to wait.
44:44
It was the breeding season.
44:45
You had to get out there then.
44:47
I got back out of the Army, and normally, when you do a master’s
44:51
study or a Ph.D., you do a big, long research review, you write up
44:55
a proposal and you do all the steps.
44:58
Okay?
44:59
I got out of the Army and it was the end of March, spotted owls were starting
45:03
to breed in March and early April.
45:06
I got back to Howard, “We’ve got to hit the field,” and
45:08
he said, “Go for it.” And so,
45:12
without a proposal, without anything, I just hit the field, and my
45:16
assignment was find spotted owls.
45:19
We need to find out what’s going on with this species.
45:22
We’ve got to find out how common they are, we need to find out where
45:26
they are, we need to find out where they’re nesting; basically anything
45:31
we can find out about the species.
45:32
We’ve got to do it and we’ve got to do it quick, because
45:37
breeding season basically runs from late March through the end of August,
45:42
so we didn’t even have time to do the usual things that you should have
45:45
done if you’re doing a master’s study [proposal/plan in advance of field work]
45:48
. Well, create some kind of a framework model/methodology, etc.
45:50
Oh, yeah.
45:52
I don’t remember doing it, maybe I did a little of that, but I hit the
45:56
field running in the summer of 1972.
45:59
I spent the whole summer out there just doing surveys all over western Oregon.
46:04
And by all over, I mean, all over.
46:07
Coast Range and Cascades?
46:08
Coast Range and Cascades.
46:09
I had a trap line, basically.
46:13
I went all the way down to Medford, over to the coast, over
46:17
at Bend and Coquille, and I had
46:21
study sites down at Gold Beach.
46:24
I’d just do surveys here and there, trying to find a sample of spotted
46:29
owls that we could collect data from.
46:31
And was this on a combination of proprietorships?
46:36
In other words, Forest Service, BLM, private, state.
46:39
Or how did that go?
46:40
At that time, it was predominantly on federal lands, just because
46:45
that’s what I had access to.
46:47
I did some surveys on non-federal lands, but the vast majority of it was Forest
46:51
Service and BLM, because that’s where the old growth was, for one thing,
46:56
and then it was just easy access.
46:58
You didn’t have to ask permission.
47:00
And, I met a bunch of people very quickly in the agencies that were also very
47:07
interested and helpful, like Bill Nietro
47:12
at Medford BLM, and Charlie Thomas at Eugene BLM.
47:17
These are biologists that were working for the agencies and that
47:22
were just enthusiastic about somebody caring about what was going on in
47:27
their lands, and wanting to get out there and figure things out.
47:31
Because at that time, there was very little energy.
47:34
No.
47:34
Going into—
47:35
Non-game wildlife, at all.
47:37
But basically, any of the things that the “-ologists” became involved
47:41
in later, especially within the post-Earth Day paradigm shift in terms
47:45
of from humanism to more biocentrism?
47:48
That was just really starting to take place within the agencies, right?
47:52
Oh, yeah.
47:52
It’s just the beginning of it, correct?
47:53
Yeah, oh, yeah.
47:54
I can remember in ’67
48:01
or ’68, there was a biologist on the on the Blue River District
48:08
and he was the first biologist on the Willamette National Forest.
48:11
[Could not recall name] He ended up going on to be one of the big-name biologists.
48:19
Anyway, it was very unusual for a district or even a forest
48:23
to have a biologist on staff.
48:26
It simply wasn’t done earlier.
48:28
But usually out of the PNW Station here in the Northwest, at that time,
48:32
or out of Washington or somewhere else?
48:33
Or the region, yeah.
48:34
[Regional Office of national forest system]
48:34
The region, yeah, right.
48:34
[Region 6 in Pacific Northwest]
48:35
Yeah, but on the districts, very few.
48:38
Like I said, Blue River was the first one in the Willamette, if I
48:41
remember right, to have a biologist.
48:43
And when
48:47
they did have a biologist, it was usually a big-game biologist;
48:50
it was not a non-game type.
48:52
Deer
48:55
and elk and big fish, etc.?
48:56
Right?
48:57
Helping them regenerate clear-cuts to provide forage for elk or deer.
49:02
It was definitely not a non-game biologist.
49:06
That was pretty darn rare.
49:09
So, when I first started running around looking for spotted owls, me and these
49:12
biologists on the districts, a lot of them were pretty excited because
49:16
it was something they really hadn’t thought about much or been involved in.
49:22
So, I started just running all over.
49:25
Once they found out that I was interested, they started paying attention, listening
49:31
to their foresters, who came in and said, “Oh, yeah, I saw one of those
49:33
stupid owls out there today.” So, they started reporting to me that we found
49:38
another one of your birds. I’d make a trip down to Medford or wherever
49:41
to go out and see another site.
49:44
In that first couple years, we just started to accrue a sample size that was
49:50
big enough to begin to learn something in terms of diet and distribution.
49:54
What did those first couple years tell you in your burgeoning
49:58
database about this animal?
50:00
Well, basically, what it told us, and Howard picked
50:02
up on this pretty darn quick,
50:06
was that these birds were more common than we thought.
50:09
We still thought they were pretty rare, but they were certainly more
50:12
common than the data prior to when we started looking would have suggested.
50:18
And that they were definitely most abundant in old forests, and that
50:24
most of the sites we found them at were getting cut very rapidly.
50:27
It was just obvious.
50:29
You’d go out there and you’d find another nest site, you’d start to look
50:32
around, there was blue paint everywhere.
50:34
I mean, there were just units laid out all over in these old
50:38
forests where these owls occurred.
50:39
Now, the owls that would be in a cut area, the adults would be able to
50:44
escape, theoretically, but a lot of times there would be young that would
50:48
be lost, I would take it, right?
50:49
Well, I don’t know how often that happened.
50:52
I mean, it certainly happened occasionally.
50:54
But, the birds are mobile.
50:57
Even young birds, after they’re a few weeks old, can fly.
51:01
Can fly, okay.
51:02
And I think there was one occasion I can remember back where they actually found
51:07
a juvenile bird that was killed by a tree that was felled in a logging unit.
51:12
But I think that kind of stuff was pretty rare.
51:17
But, certainly even, the adults can move, but
51:22
they’re also territorial, and if they’re forced to move because you
51:26
harvest their habitat, at some point, there’s no place for them to move to
51:30
without competing with the neighbors.
51:35
That’s what we were concerned about in those early years.
51:38
We just started finding these birds and every time we’d find another
51:42
pair, we’d find out that we’ve got three sales planned in that area.
51:45
That kind of thing.
51:46
So, we got concerned.
51:47
In fact, the first summer, we got concerned.
51:51
But even before that, Howard, after talking to me and talking
51:55
to others, he was pretty concerned about spotted owls in general.
51:58
Even though we didn’t know much about them, what we did know was that harvest
52:03
rates were incredibly high, that the focus was on harvesting old forest,
52:08
converting it to young forest, and
52:15
we were concerned that that was going to create problems
52:17
for things like spotted owls.
52:20
Howard actually started writing letters in 1973 to the [Oregon] State Director of
52:26
BLM and others, “We are concerned about this species, that I’ve got this grad
52:33
student, he just spent his first summer out there and, based on what he’s seeing,
52:37
we’re worried that this could potentially be a problem, if we don’t pay attention.”
52:46
Just after that first field season.
52:50
At that same time, things were happening – the Endangered
52:53
Species Act was passed in 1973.
52:56
’73. So, it was being legislated when you were in the field?
53:00
Oh, yeah.
53:00
Literally, and that would be in committee and all that kind of thing.
53:06
Oregon had put together a potential endangered species list, you know,
53:09
and the spotted owl was on that list.
53:12
So, just a whole bunch of things were happening.
53:16
The National Forest Management Act was passed in 1976, so there was a bunch of
53:21
legislation going on that was beginning to get people’s attention in terms of
53:28
worrying about species like spotted owls and marbled murrelets, things like that.
53:32
So, in
53:35
1973, right at the end of that first field season, or kind of right in the
53:37
middle of it, the State Director of the Department of Wildlife, I think it was
53:43
the Oregon Game Commission at the time, pulled together a committee, called the
53:47
Oregon Endangered Species Task Force.
53:50
Actually, it was somewhat more involved than that.
53:53
But, anyway, that was the name that I remember.
53:55
But their job was to try to deal with long-term plans for species
54:01
that might be listed as threatened.
54:03
They also used that term threatened, as well.
54:06
Endangered or threatened, they were kind of interchangeable before the ESA
54:09
became codified in culture and politics.
54:12
Right?
54:13
Right, and there were actually two different committees.
54:15
One was to focus on terrestrial species, one was supposed to focus on
54:21
aquatics.
54:21
The Oregon Endangered Species Task Force, as early as 1973, was beginning to make
54:27
recommendations for protecting spotted owls, after only one field season.
54:31
Now, do you think that was an outgrowth of the state-level progressivism that
54:35
came out of the Tom McCall years?
54:38
[Oregon Governor, 1967-75]
54:38
Well, certainly possible.
54:40
This was just at the end or after that.
54:43
Maybe.
54:44
In those years, the early ‘70s, there was this groundswell of optimism in
54:52
terms of our ability to manage for threatened and endangered species,
54:57
and be a little more holistic in terms of how we manage forests.
55:04
Certainly, the agencies weren’t ready for that.
55:07
They were still back in the mode of let’s hire all these engineers and foresters and
55:14
road crews to try to get the “cut out.” [Maximum board-feet - harvested timber]
55:16
And economists
55:17
. And economists to try to meet the annual cut.
55:21
That was the focus.
55:26
Initially, they were not particularly open to having a bunch of “-ologists”
55:30
telling them that you need to be worried about more than just board-feet.
55:35
But there certainly was a window there when the Congress was passing legislation
55:44
that focused on environment and endangered species and things like that.
55:50
They were more open to dealing with things like that, or at least with talking
55:55
about how we might do a better job.
55:59
That window is now closed, I would say.
56:04
There was just a lot going on in the early ‘70s, and a lot going on in
56:07
terms of legislation, and just an openness to try to deal with things.
56:15
Going back to your family.
56:16
Now, you told me about your brothers and your father, and being of a different
56:21
generation in terms of culture.
56:23
Do you remember some interesting conversations as you developed in your
56:28
early career about you doing all this loner stuff out in the woods and studying
56:33
birds, and they were doing their thing?
56:36
Oh, no.
56:37
I think
56:39
my whole family was always pretty supportive of what I did.
56:42
Even my brothers.
56:44
I was the only one that got a four-year college degree of all my brothers.
56:48
Most of them ended up going to work fairly early-on, and trying to make a living.
56:54
They were always very supportive of me.
56:55
The only times they weren’t was when I did something stupid, like when I
56:58
made some dumbass comment in the press.
57:02
I got quoted in a newspaper one time
57:06
after one of the big fires.
57:10
The reporter was asking me about salvage logging after a
57:14
fire that was caused by arson.
57:16
And I made this comment, and this was just really stupid, “Well, you know, if
57:22
we allow them to salvage in arson-caused fires, that might encourage some crazy
57:27
logger to go out there and set fires.” And I got quoted in the newspaper.
57:32
And my brother, Tom, who is normally pretty reasonable, he’s the timber guy.
57:38
He called me up, “You fuckin’ asshole,” [laughs]
57:45
“What are you doing?” Yeah, that was just dumb.
57:48
I got reprimanded.
57:50
Actually, I was working for the Forest Service when I did that.
57:54
You mean, in the ‘70s or the ‘80s?
57:55
It would have been in the ‘80s, yeah.
57:57
Oh, okay, this was later, okay.
57:57
And I got quoted in a newspaper.
58:01
The reporter felt bad because,
58:05
well, we both should have known better.
58:07
But, yeah.
58:08
And so, I got reprimanded, and I very quickly realized what I had done.
58:13
And I wrote a letter to the editor saying
58:19
I’ve got a lot of respect for loggers, I didn’t mean, blah, blah, blah.
58:21
It was just stupid, yeah.
58:22
Did your brother forgive you?
58:24
Oh, yeah.
58:25
They have.
58:26
I think especially after I did a public mea culpa.
58:31
And kind of like I say, I submitted a long letter to the newspaper saying, “Hey.”
58:35
Mr. Garza?
58:36
I think it was with him.
58:43
So, anyway, continue on, where you were?
58:46
Oh, man, I don’t remember where I was.
58:47
You were backtracking on the newspaper.
58:55
Yeah, I’m trying to think of what that was, though, I’ve kind of lost my
59:05
train of thought.
59:05
I was talking about the early ‘70s and just sort of the
59:08
dynamics that were going on then.
59:09
But also, what you were doing study-wise, and also how it related to land
59:13
management and what you were witnessing?
59:15
All I was doing those first years, from ’72 to ’74, basically [observing and
59:22
collecting data] . About a year into my study after that first field season,
59:26
I actually got a proposal together so that I could sit down with my
59:30
committee, and got the proposal approved.
59:33
We formalized what I was doing, but,
59:39
it was still pretty much an observational kind of study where my goals were
59:46
to find as many spotted owls as I could, and to survey as broadly
59:50
as I could in western Oregon to document distribution and abundance.
59:55
And to find as many nests as I could find, to document what sorts of trees they were
59:59
using for nesting, to collect pellets so that we could look at their diet,
1:00:04
to collect basic behavioral information on when the young came out of the nest,
1:00:10
how long they were cared for by the adults, when they dispersed, what kinds of
1:00:15
habitat they occurred in, and whether they occurred in old forests or young forests.
1:00:19
Those were the kinds of things I focused on.
1:00:24
It took me basically three years, ’72, ’73 and ’74, those three field seasons, to
1:00:30
collect the data and get a thesis written.
1:00:34
What was the name of your thesis, do you recall?
1:00:37
“Biology and Distribution of the Spotted Owl in Oregon,” I think it was.
1:00:41
Something like that.
1:00:41
But that must be simple
1:00:47
methodologically compared to what you did later, but still an important document
1:00:51
because there wasn’t a lot there before.
1:00:51
Oh, yeah.
1:00:52
It was the foundational document just because you did it.
1:00:56
Yeah, well, it was the first large-scale study of the spotted owl anywhere.
1:01:01
Okay, it was the first really detailed look at kind of how what made ‘em tick.
1:01:07
And there were other people that got involved shortly after I did.
1:01:12
Gordon Gould in California started doing surveys in 1973.
1:01:17
A few guys up in Washington, Howard Postovit,
1:01:22
Harriet Allen, and Larry Brewer.
1:01:23
They started doing surveys in Washington in about 1976, something like that.
1:01:29
So, there were others getting involved, but none of them did a
1:01:33
formal master’s project where they actually published the results in
1:01:41
a thesis.
1:01:44
But while we were doing that those first three years, the Oregon Endangered
1:01:47
Species Task Force was busy working away trying to come up with recommendations
1:01:51
for how to manage this species.
1:01:53
And as early as late 1973,
1:01:57
they suggested that in Oregon, all known sites should be protected with a core area
1:02:06
of at least, I think it was 300 acres.
1:02:08
Okay.
1:02:10
And the BLM immediately said, “No, we won’t do that, we want
1:02:15
you to set some target for Oregon.
1:02:18
We don’t want to just say protect all known pairs.”
1:02:21
You mean, a target of how many?
1:02:22
So, how many pairs.
1:02:23
In other words, what is a viable population level?
1:02:26
Well, they weren’t talking about viable populations back then, but they were
1:02:29
saying, “Okay, if we’ve got to do something, tell us how many.” And so, the
1:02:33
Oregon Endangered Species Task Force came right back and said, “Okay, we recommend
1:02:37
100 pairs in Oregon, each one of which you need to manage for 300 acres of old forest
1:02:43
as a core area.” Okay, so that was kind of the first real plan, and that was in 1973.
1:02:53
Then it just sort of ramped up from there.
1:02:55
Now, that only applied to which lands, though?
1:02:58
To federal lands.
1:02:59
To federal lands.
1:03:00
Okay.
1:03:01
Yeah, yeah.
1:03:02
At that point, nobody was talking about non-federal lands requirements for owls.
1:03:08
It was, yeah, I’m trying to think,
1:03:15
by 1976,
1:03:22
they were proposing 400 pairs on public lands in Oregon.
1:03:26
The same agency?
1:03:28
Yeah, well, the Oregon Endangered Species Task Force.
1:03:30
The task force.
1:03:31
Yeah, this task force.
1:03:32
So, things ramped up pretty quick.
1:03:36
And by
1:03:39
1976, we also had data on their home range size, so we were beginning
1:03:42
to learn something about how much.
1:03:43
That had to do with your work, as well as other people that
1:03:46
were starting to do work, too?
1:03:47
It had to do with Ph.D. work we did on the Andrews.
1:03:51
So, after your masters was finished, you immediately continued in the
1:03:56
Ph.D. track, and basically, you did a more intense, in-depth study.
1:04:05
Correct?
1:04:05
Right, correct.
1:04:05
Howard White, who was my major prof for my master’s study, he and I kind of
1:04:14
talked about doing a Ph.D. and agreed that that would be a good thing to do.
1:04:19
I mean, there was a lot of interest in spotted owls by 1975-76.
1:04:25
Howard talked to the Forest Service and the BLM and was able to get funding.
1:04:31
And so, I went right from finishing a master’s thesis in 1975 to doing a
1:04:38
Ph.D. In fact, the ink was barely dry before I was in the field up on the
1:04:43
Andrews in, it would have been April of
1:04:49
1975, putting radio collars on spotted owls.
1:04:52
Because we decided that, okay, by that time, we had a lot of data
1:04:57
on basic biology on what they ate, where they nested, what kinds of
1:05:01
habitat they occurred in, kind of a rough idea of what their
1:05:03
distribution was, but we didn’t know.
1:05:05
[In-depth data] What the agencies were all saying was, “If we’ve got to manage
1:05:08
these damn things, how much habitat do we have got to give ‘em?” And we
1:05:13
kept saying, “Well, we don’t know.
1:05:14
We don’t have any data.” There had never been a radio telemetry
1:05:16
study done on spotted owls.
1:05:18
And, in fact, radio telemetry back in those days, was kind
1:05:21
of in its fledgling years.
1:05:24
I mean, Tom Dunstan back at Minnesota, had put radio collars on some barred owls.
1:05:29
They’re a big, clunky radio collar.
1:05:32
They
1:05:36
had done a little work on barred owls.
1:05:41
I had read about those studies, and gotten pretty excited about trying to do
1:05:45
something like that with spotted owls.
1:05:47
And I started talking to Howard about it.
1:05:52
We were faced with this demand from the agencies that, if you’re going
1:05:56
to make us manage these things, how many acres do we have to give them?
1:06:00
So, we said, fine, we’ll do a radio telemetry study.
1:06:02
It’ll be a lot of fun.
1:06:05
We got money to go up to the H.J. Andrews and do a one-year telemetry study.
1:06:11
We went into it thinking, “Okay, what we know about barred owls is they have
1:06:15
home ranges that are about, you know, 900 acres-1,000 acres, something like
1:06:19
that, so probably spotted owls are similar.” They had done some studies
1:06:24
in Europe where they’d look at tawny owls, which are a similar species.
1:06:27
And they had little tiny home ranges of 60-100 acres, something like that.
1:06:31
So, we thought, “Okay, we’re going to put these transmitters on spotted
1:06:34
owls and find that they have home ranges that are probably like a
1:06:37
barred owl.” And so, we did that.
1:06:39
We went out in April of 1975, up on the Andrews.
1:06:44
We were hoping to get about ten birds radio-collared.
1:06:48
We ended up getting eight in May and June of 1975, or, I’m
1:06:54
sorry, April to June of 1975.
1:06:57
We tracked them, I tracked them for that whole winter.
1:06:59
I was up there by myself and I tracked those eight birds over the course
1:07:05
of the winter until June of 1976.
1:07:08
Did they even have a trailer there yet?
1:07:10
No.
1:07:10
People were still staying down at Blue River here in the
1:07:14
Ranger District area, right?
1:07:15
Well, there was nobody up there.
1:07:16
I’m talking about down in Blue River town.
1:07:19
Yeah, they were still
1:07:20
-- Where the actual ranger district was and that was where that lodging
1:07:23
for the Forest Service people was, but you were up in the sticks.
1:07:26
Yeah, there was really in those years, I mean, by 1975, the big “old-growth
1:07:36
biome” or whatever-they-called-it project [Coniferous Forest Biome] had happened up
1:07:39
there on the Andrews. People had done some survey work, like I remember Ron Nussbaum
1:07:44
was up there looking at herps [amphibians and reptiles] and things. But there really
1:07:51
wasn’t a whole lot going on research-wise.
1:07:52
It was a pretty quiet place.
1:07:53
And yeah, I spent the whole year up there.
1:07:56
I moved out there with my trailer.
1:07:59
Chuck Meslow had gotten a little old sixteen-foot travel
1:08:02
trailer from some place.
1:08:03
So, you did have lodging.
1:08:04
You weren’t in a tent?
1:08:05
I did.
1:08:06
Yeah, I parked it out there.
1:08:08
I initially parked it up on that little spur road, if you go past McRae Creek,
1:08:14
on up to Lookout Creek, there’s a little spur that goes up on a hill right
1:08:17
there and dead-ends in an old landing.
1:08:20
And I parked it up there for the first few months and then the snows
1:08:25
hit in late September of October, and I was getting snowed in up there.
1:08:30
So, I pulled it back down, and I parked it in the big gravel storage area which
1:08:35
is now where the main admin site is.
1:08:37
Right.
1:08:38
All it was then was a big pile of gravel and a turnaround.
1:08:42
I parked it there and spent the winter there in my trailer.
1:08:48
Basically, once we’d get the radios on, my daily schedule consisted of working,
1:08:57
as soon as it got dark in the evening, I would start to track the birds.
1:09:00
I would go until whenever I got tired or till daybreak, go sleep a few hours,
1:09:06
get up in the afternoon, hike in on one or two birds to collect pellets.
1:09:11
I’d go in and I’d find the bird in the roost, flag the roost -- this is during
1:09:15
the winter -- and go back a day or two later to the roost and see if I could
1:09:21
get a pellet, because that’s the only way you can get pellets in the wintertime.
1:09:25
But, anyway, I spent that first year out there doing that, going 24/7 just about.
1:09:34
Now, when you did your earlier study, which was kind of a broad demographic
1:09:38
study across the whole, big parts of Oregon, you probably never got
1:09:44
a chance to know particular birds.
1:09:47
I mean, you put radio collars on some of them, but in terms of this
1:09:52
is the first time that you were involved with specific sets of birds?
1:09:57
You’d get really attached to your birds, yeah.
1:09:59
Well, tell me a little bit about that?
1:10:01
Basically, you throw a transmitter on them, and the transmitters we
1:10:05
used were pretty big and heavy, so, you worry constantly about having
1:10:09
the bird being affected by that transmitter, not being able to forage,
1:10:16
or getting somehow damaged by the transmitter rubbing on it.
1:10:20
These are pretty obtrusive things you’re doing to a bird.
1:10:24
And so, you worry about that constantly.
1:10:27
You worry about having your bird die, because, obviously,
1:10:30
if they die, you can’t get data.
1:10:32
You worry about affecting their movements so that you’re
1:10:35
underestimating their home range areas.
1:10:37
Because of the thing that’s on them, right?
1:10:38
Because they’re lugging a big-old twenty-gram transmitter around.
1:10:42
Plus, you go in you see them every day just about, walking in,
1:10:46
finding them in their roostery in the middle of winter up there.
1:10:51
You watch them breed and bring up young, and you watch the
1:10:55
young come out of the nest.
1:10:57
You get very involved with your animals.
1:10:59
You can’t help it, but you’re there with them 24-hours-a -day just about.
1:11:07
But, just as a scientist, you’re worried about getting enough
1:11:09
data to estimate home ranges.
1:11:13
My schedule was, I’d find a bird, I would sit on it, taking a
1:11:18
location every fifteen minutes, and
1:11:24
collect data on it.
1:11:24
So, that was the kind of nighttime schedule that I kept.
1:11:31
Do you think they got to know you?
1:11:33
Oh, yeah, they get used to you being around.
1:11:35
So, they don’t just fly away.
1:11:37
After a while, it’s like, “Oh, it’s that guy.”
1:11:39
Yeah, exactly.
1:11:40
Owls are not very afraid of humans to begin with.
1:11:43
But when you sit with them all the time every day, they see you hiking under
1:11:48
their roost and picking up pellets.
1:11:50
Yeah, you just get to be kind of one of those slow terrestrial things
1:11:54
that they don’t much care about.
1:11:59
But, yeah, that’s what we did for that year.
1:12:02
I came back, and at the end of that field season, started to analyze that data.
1:12:11
We knew before then, but at the end of the year, we realized these
1:12:13
guys have really huge home ranges.
1:12:15
They don’t have these little dinky home ranges like a barred owl, they have home
1:12:19
ranges that are 2,500 to 4,500 acres.
1:12:24
They are three or four times or five times the size of a barred owl’s home range.
1:12:30
Is that because of their diet and their needs for foraging?
1:12:33
They’re very much a specialized forest predator.
1:12:35
They feed on things that occur at fairly-low densities.
1:12:37
Flying squirrels, for example, and red tree voles.
1:12:41
When you’re that much of a specialist, you have to forage
1:12:44
over a big area to get enough food.
1:12:46
If you’re a barred owl, barred owls eat everything.
1:12:48
They eat insects, they eat lots of snails and salamanders and crayfish
1:12:54
and birds, and so they’re able to exist in a much smaller home range area.
1:13:02
Spotted owls, being the specialists they are, they’ve
1:13:03
got to have a lot of real estate.
1:13:05
But,
1:13:07
at the end of that year, we were going back to the Oregon Endangered Species
1:13:11
Task Force and the agencies saying, “Well, we were wrong guys, these guys
1:13:15
don’t just need 300 acres of old forest, they’ve got to have a lot more than that.”
1:13:22
By now, Howard had died.
1:13:23
Howard got cancer.
1:13:25
Howard White?
1:13:25
Howard White.
1:13:26
In 1975, just after I started the study, he got cancer and died.
1:13:32
Fairly quickly.
1:13:33
And Chuck Meslow took over as my major prof.
1:13:35
That must have been fairly traumatic for you?
1:13:38
Yeah.
1:13:38
He was a neat-old guy, he was a damned-good mentor.
1:13:41
I was pretty close to him.
1:13:45
Chuck took over, and Chuck was a young biologist not much older than I was.
1:13:48
Well, he might be ten years older than me.
1:13:53
So, he and I went back to the Oregon Endangered Species Task Force guys and
1:13:58
whoever would listen, because we gave talks to the Audubon Society saying,
1:14:00
“Hey, we now know that this species, if we just protect 300 acres, it’s probably
1:14:06
not going to be enough.” You know, the minimum we found in any of those home
1:14:11
ranges we looked at, the minimum amount of old forest was about 1,000 acres
1:14:15
of old forest in that home range area.
1:14:18
What was their response?
1:14:20
Well, I think the
1:14:26
biologists in the agencies were completely receptive to that,
1:14:30
but timber folks, much less so.
1:14:32
They pushed back really hard and said,
1:14:38
“We definitely can’t manage for two or three or 4,000 acres per pair, and
1:14:42
even a thousand acres is crazy, if you’re talking about very many pairs.
1:14:47
We simply can’t afford that, it’s too expensive.” It was kind
1:14:50
of the pushback that we got.
1:14:54
But, by 1987,
1:14:59
the Oregon Endangered Species Task Force, only a year later, they were
1:15:03
recommending a minimum of 1,000 acres of older forest per pair.
1:15:08
Which is 10 years after you made your original observations.
1:15:08
Ten years, yeah.
1:15:12
And not only that, but by ’87, they were recommending a target of 400 pairs in.
1:15:15
I don’t mean ’87, I mean ’77.
1:15:15
They were recommending a target of 400 pairs of spotted owls in
1:15:19
Oregon, with 300 acres each, but, I think, actually, that was ’77.
1:15:24
They were recommending
1:15:39
290 pairs on the Forest Service, 90 pairs on BLM, and 20 on other public lands.
1:15:46
But by ’81,
1:15:50
they were recommending 1,000 acres within 1.5 miles of these, what they called,
1:15:56
SOMAs, or Spotted Owl Management Areas.
1:15:58
I want you to tell me about the finishing your Ph.D. and the transition
1:16:02
into what it was later, but tell me a little bit more about the Andrews.
1:16:06
Okay.
1:16:07
I mean, it was transitioning itself from its International Biological
1:16:13
Program years into the EER [Experimental Ecological Reserve] , which was
1:16:16
the transition to the LTER, the Long-Term Ecological Research network.
1:16:20
It was essentially a change in name as they were transitioning.
1:16:24
But what do you remember about their program?
1:16:26
I mean, you were there in the winter time and not much was going on.
1:16:28
But I was there in the summer, too, but yeah.
1:16:30
But that was becoming the synergy of that whole thing, which really parallels these
1:16:35
broader societal dynamics that we have.
1:16:36
What do you remember about the Andrews and the people that were going up there?
1:16:40
Jerry Franklin was involved, Fred Swanson, a lot of these people,
1:16:44
like Stan Gregory, I don’t know if he’d [Gregory] started yet?
1:16:46
Stan was at OSU.
1:16:47
Yeah.
1:16:48
I mean, these people were really starting to get going, but what do
1:16:51
you remember about the synergy of all that as you’re doing your owl work?
1:16:54
Well, it’s kind of funny.
1:16:55
I was kind of on the outside.
1:16:56
I didn’t really interact with those guys much at all, back in those years.
1:17:02
I knew Stan because we were fellow grad students at
1:17:07
OSU, but Jerry was off in his little world doing forest ecology stuff.
1:17:14
And in those early years, Jerry was very interested, at least my
1:17:20
impression was, very interested in forest ecology and sort of
1:17:26
the stand dynamics in terms of the transition from early to
1:17:30
late seral, all kinds of stuff.
1:17:33
But he really wasn’t that interested in old growth, per se, in those early years.
1:17:38
At least, that was my impression.
1:17:40
He was developing the research that would become that though.
1:17:43
Yeah, yeah.
1:17:44
Because the foundational document for his career and old growth, really,
1:17:49
which is “The Ecological Characteristics of Old-Growth Forests,” in 1981.
1:17:52
Right, he and, who did that?
1:17:57
Tom Spies, I think, worked on that with him, if I remember right, didn’t he?
1:17:59
Not, well, maybe.
1:18:01
[Document published before Tom Spies was in NW.]
1:18:02
I think it was Tom.
1:18:04
I
1:18:06
think Tom co-authored it.
1:18:07
It was et al. There were like eight other co-authors.
1:18:07
[Franklin, Cromack, Denison, McKee, Maser, Sedell, Swanson, Juday.]
1:18:08
I think he and Tom co-authored that paper, if I remember right.
1:18:08
But at least in the early ‘70s, I don’t remember Jerry being particularly
1:18:12
interested in old forests at all.
1:18:14
He was just repurposing his career himself, actually, from a traditional
1:18:18
forestry guy to kind of incorporating what became known as ecosystem science
1:18:23
methodologies and perspectives.
1:18:26
Yeah, right.
1:18:27
So, I really didn’t interact much with those guys, as I kind of was off in my
1:18:32
own little world doing spotted owl stuff.
1:18:34
I did interact with them when they were doing the
1:18:40
biome thing on the Andrews.
1:18:42
I interacted a bit with Ron Nussbaum, who was there doing contract work, where he
1:18:47
was looking at herps [amphibians mainly] composition in those old forests up there.
1:18:51
And the main reason I interacted with Ron was because I knew his wife had worked
1:18:57
a bit here on campus, and, when he was up there on Watershed 2 one day and he
1:19:06
came down that little patch of old growth and a spotted owl took
1:19:10
a bath right in front of him.
1:19:11
He called me up and said, “Hey, I saw one of your birds.”
1:19:12
And so, I went up there.
1:19:14
This was in ’72, if I remember right, the first year I was doing my master’s work.
1:19:21
We walked into that site and I called, and here is a pair of spotted owls
1:19:24
nesting right there above where he had seen this bird take a bath.
1:19:28
Then, we went on up Lookout Creek, and we found two more pairs of spotted owls.
1:19:34
That got me really fired up about working on the Andrews, just because
1:19:38
I knew there were some birds there.
1:19:40
After that, I kept going back there every year to check those birds,
1:19:44
to try to find more nesting pairs.
1:19:48
But all that was kind of independent of the other folks
1:19:51
that were working up there.
1:19:52
I didn’t really interact with them much.
1:19:53
How much did the Andrews forestry treatment program affect your decision
1:19:58
to work there, which originally was a traditional experimental forest
1:20:01
designed to study the effects of different treatment methods in the
1:20:06
context of industrial forestry; its effect on hydrology, fire, regeneration,
1:20:13
within the traditional economic model?
1:20:15
But, because they did a lot of comparative stuff in different ages and different
1:20:19
times, didn’t that create, not just when you were doing your masters and
1:20:24
doctorate, but later on, an interesting laboratory for comparative studies of old
1:20:30
growth, plantations, clear-cuts, etc.?
1:20:34
Yeah, it certainly did.
1:20:35
Because when I got up there to do the telemetry study in 1975-76, and
1:20:42
most of, or a lot of the cutting that happened up there, had already happened.
1:20:45
They had done big clear-cuts all over the place.
1:20:48
And at least in terms of comparing, one of the things we wanted to do
1:20:53
with these radio-collared owls, was to find out what kinds of
1:20:55
habitat they preferred or selected.
1:20:59
If all we’d had was old growth, we wouldn’t have been able to do that.
1:21:02
But because we had these contrasting clear-cuts and early seral and old forest,
1:21:07
and even a little bit of mid-seral stuff, we were able to do those comparisons.
1:21:13
So, in a sense, it was a laboratory.
1:21:14
It was.
1:21:15
It would
1:21:18
have been better if we had a little more of the early, 30-40-year-old stuff, but
1:21:24
what we had was a lot of old growth, sort of the mature category, the 80 to
1:21:29
160-year-old stuff on some of the ridge areas and early seral and clear-cuts.
1:21:34
Now, the 80 to 160-year-old stuff would have been—
1:21:36
[Break in Audio]
1:21:40
Okay, continue with the concept that we had been talking about before the
1:21:43
interruption that it [H.J. Andrews] made a good laboratory, if you will, because
1:21:47
of the differential ages in cuttings and treatments that had happened?
1:21:50
[Also had records of wildfire history going back centuries]
1:21:51
Yeah,
1:21:53
it wouldn’t have been a very interesting study if all we had was old growth up
1:21:56
there because, in addition to figuring out how much area these owls used
1:22:04
in terms of their home range size, we wanted to find out what kinds of
1:22:07
habitat they preferred or selected.
1:22:10
So, to do that, you have to have a mix of habitats, obviously, or they
1:22:14
can’t do the selection process.
1:22:16
So, yeah, the fact that they had clear-cut a bunch of areas on the
1:22:20
Andrews, made it so that we could do that.
1:22:24
It still probably wasn’t the best study area we could have picked in
1:22:26
terms of having a broad range of age classes, but we kind of solved
1:22:32
for that problem by going elsewhere.
1:22:35
We did the study on the Andrews where we had this certain mix of forest
1:22:39
dominated by old growth for sure, but then we did a follow-up to that over
1:22:44
on Eugene BLM lands about nineteen, oh, what was it, about a year,
1:22:55
1981, I think it was.
1:22:56
I went over and worked on the Eugene BLM District.
1:23:00
Which side of the Eugene area?
1:23:01
On the west side, out in the Coast Range.
1:23:03
On the Coast Range, okay.
1:23:03
We put radios on six more spotted owls.
1:23:06
I only tracked them for the summer for about three or four months, but there
1:23:11
the birds had, in addition to a fair amount of old growth, they had a lot
1:23:15
of more even-aged young forest, much of which was on private land, I mean, those
1:23:21
alternating sections of BLM and private.
1:23:24
So, there we had--
1:23:25
The checkerboard effect?
1:23:26
The checkerboard.
1:23:27
We had a mix of forest types that included a lot of young forest.
1:23:31
And in the monograph we eventually wrote on spotted owls, the home
1:23:38
range monograph, we had included that data from the BLM land.
1:23:43
So, we had a mix of data from the Andrews and from some BLM property
1:23:48
that helped us to kind of get a broader perspective on how these
1:23:52
owls behaved in terms of the kinds of habitat that they seemed to prefer.
1:23:58
What would be a general statement about the differences
1:24:09
you found in terms of behavior, demographics, what-have-you, between,
1:24:15
the Cascades and Coast Range?
1:24:18
I mean, you have different elevational dynamics, you have
1:24:21
different climatic dynamics because you’re closer to the coast?
1:24:26
What we found was that home ranges of spotted owls appear to be smaller
1:24:33
in areas where the landscape is dominated by lots of old forest.
1:24:37
So, when you get into a landscape that has been heavily impacted by harvest,
1:24:41
for example, the BLM checkerboard ownership in the Coast Range, home
1:24:45
ranges tended to be a lot larger there.
1:24:49
Andy Carey found the same thing when he did his radio telemetry
1:24:52
studies in 1987, ’88, ’89, I think
1:24:59
it was over on Roseburg BLM lands.
1:25:03
He found that home ranges tended to be larger in areas where you had
1:25:09
relatively little old forest, than in areas where you had lots of old forest.
1:25:12
So, again, it just looked like these birds are having to use larger areas
1:25:18
when they have less suitable habitat.
1:25:21
So, that’s kind of the pattern that we saw.
1:25:26
So, you finished your doctorate in ’81 or ’82?
1:25:30
I finished the doctorate in 1980.
1:25:34
And what was the title of your Ph.D. dissertation?
1:25:36
“Home Range and Habitat Use by Northern Spotted Owls in
1:25:41
Oregon,” or something like that.
1:25:43
Up to that time when you were going through school, were you continuing
1:25:46
to work periodically for the Forest Service, as well, didn’t you do summer
1:25:49
work, is that what you were saying?
1:25:50
No, I didn’t.
1:25:52
Once I started school, I pretty much just went to school.
1:25:54
But you did do a little summer Forest Service stuff in the ‘60s.
1:25:58
Right?
1:25:58
Oh, yeah.
1:25:59
Okay.
1:25:59
I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t a continuum of seasonal types of positions.
1:26:01
No, no.
1:26:02
Okay.
1:26:03
The seasonal jobs that I had were when I was an undergraduate in college.
1:26:08
I worked three summers on the Blue River District.
1:26:13
The first summer, it would have been 1967,
1:26:18
and I worked up there as a recreational technician.
1:26:23
I spent the summer dumping empty garbage cans in the camp grounds or
1:26:27
washing toilets and doing whatever.
1:26:30
And in late summer when the fires got started, I helped too, like that was
1:26:35
the year of the Hoodoo Burn, 1967.
1:26:38
Right.
1:26:40
My boss
1:26:45
and I went up to the burn area and built wooden floors to set the tents up on.
1:26:51
They had a bunch of wall tents in the main camp for the fire operations.
1:26:56
I remember, we went up there and nailed together these plywood floors.
1:26:59
Also
1:27:02
fought a little fire on one of the fires up by McKenzie Bridge there.
1:27:07
So, basically, your employment was related to your schooling, either
1:27:11
as a research assistant or teaching assistant or what have you, right?
1:27:16
Well, okay, after that first year ’67, the next year I was on the trail crew.
1:27:21
Actually, it was the fire crew.
1:27:22
We spent much of the summer piling slash and burning slash and fighting fires.
1:27:27
That third summer I was at Box Canyon on the fire crew, the trail crew.
1:27:31
I actually ran the trail crew that year.
1:27:32
We spent a lot of time early in the summer hiking back in and working the trail.
1:27:37
But those three seasonal summers I spent with the Forest Service was the last
1:27:41
time I worked for them in any kind of capacity until I went to work for them
1:27:47
full-time in ’87 as a research biologist.
1:27:50
So, when I finished my Ph.D. in 1980,
1:27:57
I spent the next several years writing all the data up, getting it published.
1:28:05
I was basically unemployed, though.
1:28:06
I got married in 1980, and my wife was a school teacher.
1:28:14
So, we were living off her income while I did temporary work.
1:28:17
I did all kinds of carpentry jobs.
1:28:20
I started climbing and doing tree removals in people’s yards.
1:28:26
I worked for Charlie Thomas doing that telemetry study on
1:28:31
the BLM project for one summer.
1:28:33
I spent two summers going up to British Columbia doing spotted owl surveys in BC.
1:28:40
For the Canadian government?
1:28:41
For the Canadian government.
1:28:43
I did contract work for ODF&W [Oregon Dept. of Fish & Wildlife] . I designed
1:28:49
the first computerized database to keep track of spotted owls in Oregon,
1:28:57
and did this also for
1:29:00
grey
1:29:09
owl surveys.
1:29:10
We published a paper on that.
1:29:12
So, all these little, basically, odd jobs.
1:29:15
Because, when I finished my Ph.D., I was so frustrated with the
1:29:21
Forest Service and the BLM, that I swore I would never work for them.
1:29:26
I spent years butting heads with them trying to get some kind of a spotted owl
1:29:30
management plan implemented that would
1:29:34
-- And this is from your graduate school days on through the ’80s, right?
1:29:37
Yeah.
1:29:42
Chuck Meslow, Howard White, and myself had spent years in one fight after
1:29:47
the other, trying to get the agencies to adopt a plan that would do a
1:29:53
good job of protecting spotted owls.
1:29:54
It was just always a battle.
1:29:56
At that time, all the individual forests were trying to complete their forest
1:30:05
management plans as mandated by the 1976 National Forest Management Act.
1:30:11
So, part of that discussion you were entering into was a wild card.
1:30:16
Yeah.
1:30:16
This new element that would complicate things?
1:30:20
Yeah, and I was kind of oblivious to all that.
1:30:23
I was so focused on spotted owls.
1:30:27
To be fair to the agencies, we waltzed in there expecting them to do a lot, and
1:30:35
they begrudgingly did adopt
1:30:39
some management plans for spotted owls.
1:30:41
It probably wasn’t enough, but it was certainly more than they wanted
1:30:47
in terms of the impact on timber sale programs, things like that.
1:30:52
Right.
1:30:52
But anyway, when I got through with all that, I’d been butting heads for years
1:30:57
with the agencies, and I finished my Ph.D., and I just thought, “You know,
1:31:01
I don’t want to work for these guys.
1:31:02
I just don’t.” So, I spent a bunch of years just trying to figure
1:31:08
out what I was going to do next, but doing all this contract work
1:31:12
and trying to make ends meet.
1:31:13
Did you ever think about being an academic?
1:31:16
Not really.
1:31:16
I just didn’t think I’d be good at it, so I didn’t.
1:31:21
So, teaching was never your thing?
1:31:23
It was not.
1:31:23
I didn’t like speaking in front of groups.
1:31:25
I did a lot of it, but it was always, and still is for me, always difficult.
1:31:32
You didn’t want to be forced to have to do it every day in front of a big class?
1:31:35
Which probably would have been good for me, but I avoided it.
1:31:38
I didn’t like it, and it was always stressful, although I gave lots
1:31:41
of talks to BLM groups and Audubon groups and Forest Service groups.
1:31:46
But every time I did, it was stressful.
1:31:47
It just was not something I liked, and so I just never applied for
1:31:54
a single academic job in my life.
1:31:55
I just never did.
1:31:57
I just kind of kept doing all this temporary work, trying
1:31:59
to figure out, “Okay, Forsman, what are you going to do next.”
1:32:03
[Break in Audio]
1:32:03
Back to where we were.
1:32:04
Okay, so
1:32:07
I casting about for what I was going to do next and doing all these contract jobs.
1:32:13
And I did a whole bunch of little contract short-term things with the
1:32:16
various agencies, but nothing permanent.
1:32:20
And then out-of-the-blue in 1987, I got a call from Len Ruggiero.
1:32:27
Len was the leader of the old-growth project with PNW, at
1:32:34
least the terrestrial part of it.
1:32:36
And he said, “Hey, I need a spotted owl biologist to do full-time research on
1:32:43
spotted owls on the Olympic Peninsula and other areas. Would you like a job?” And
1:32:53
-- [laughs].
1:32:53
In spite of your pledge.
1:32:55
Not only that, but he said, “You know,” he says, “I know I can
1:32:57
hire you because you’re a vet. You have veteran’s preference.
1:33:01
I won’t have to go through competition.
1:33:03
I won’t have to open it up,” you know.
1:33:04
And I said,
1:33:07
“Okay.” So, that’s how I got into my job with PNW.
1:33:13
So, that started in ’87, right?
1:33:17
It started in ’87, right,
1:33:19
right.
1:33:19
Now, you’ve got some notes and some details here, and you wanted
1:33:22
to really tell me about details between when you started, and when
1:33:27
the high-profile stuff started.
1:33:30
Do you want to fill in the gaps any more with any stories or experiences?
1:33:34
You talked about working with the Oregon Department of Natural Resources.
1:33:38
Correct?
1:33:40
Or Fish and Wildlife?
1:33:41
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
1:33:42
Fish and Wildlife.
1:33:42
Correct.
1:33:43
They were just contract jobs, basically.
1:33:45
Nothing very exciting.
1:33:47
Although, the one I did with Charlie Bruce at the local ODF&W office [Corvallis-State
1:33:55
of Oregon] , in which I basically spent four months or more just compiling all
1:34:00
of the spotted owl data from all over Oregon, putting it into a database, a
1:34:05
quantitative and searchable database that helped us actually keep track of things.
1:34:09
Because
1:34:12
of all the people doing surveys, by the late ‘70s, the districts were
1:34:18
doing surveys, all the BLM districts and Forest Service districts.
1:34:21
We were getting a lot of data really rapidly.
1:34:24
On the owl?
1:34:25
On spotted owls.
1:34:26
And we needed some way to make sense out of it all.
1:34:30
So, that’s why.
1:34:31
So, you were a synthesizer, essentially?
1:34:32
Yeah, basically, I went to every district in the range of the spotted owl in
1:34:36
western Oregon, sat down with their biologists, went through their data and
1:34:41
actually put together this database.
1:34:42
And that database continues to this day.
1:34:47
Janice Reed down at Roseburg is still trying to keep that database updated
1:34:51
with all the historical stuff we have.
1:34:53
Now, leading up to ’87 was really when all the dynamics that would
1:34:57
become called the “Forest Wars” were really starting to heat up.
1:35:00
Yeah.
1:35:01
What do you remember about that in general, aside from your spotted owl work?
1:35:04
Oh, gosh.
1:35:05
Well, there were just a whole series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits that were
1:35:13
happening in the late ‘70s and ‘80s.
1:35:19
Eventually, there were a whole lot of other people in
1:35:24
the ‘80s that got involved.
1:35:27
Larry Harris from Florida [University of Florida-Gainesville] came
1:35:29
out here, and spent one summer running around talking to people.
1:35:33
I think he went back home and wrote that book, The Fragmented Forest.
1:35:38
He studied at the Andrews a lot, yeah.
1:35:40
Well,
1:35:43
that book had a big impact.
1:35:44
The
1:35:47
Audubon Society got involved and they pulled together their
1:35:50
“blue ribbon” panel of experts.
1:35:52
This was in 1985, I think.
1:35:56
They brought their weight to bear on the whole thing.
1:35:59
That would eventually turn into the lawsuit that got to Judge
1:36:00
Dwyer [William, U.S. District Court Judge,] eventually, right?
1:36:00
Yeah, exactly.
1:36:00
There
1:36:05
was a whole series of status reviews that happened.
1:36:10
From ’82 to 1990.
1:36:12
The Fish and Wildlife Service conducted four different status
1:36:16
reviews of the spotted owl.
1:36:17
They kept not liking the answers they got.
1:36:20
So, the first one in ’82, they did this review, then they did
1:36:25
another one in ’87, where they recommended listing but didn’t list.
1:36:29
Was that the infamous
1:36:32
“God Squad?”
1:36:33
No.
1:36:33
The God Squad happened about that same time.
1:36:36
I can’t remember exactly when.
1:36:38
But finally in ’88, Judge Zilly [Thomas] ruled that, based on the status reviews
1:36:46
that they had done, that their decision not to list the owl as threatened,
1:36:51
was arbitrary and capricious, so it went back to the agencies again.
1:36:56
They did another status review.
1:36:58
Finally, they did another status review in 1990, the fourth one, which ended
1:37:02
up with the owl getting listed in 1990.
1:37:05
But, there were just a whole bunch of things like that going on in the
1:37:09
‘80s, lawsuits; counter-lawsuits,
1:37:14
the Audubon Blue Ribbon panels, Larry Harris’ book, a bunch of things
1:37:19
like that, all happening at once, or happening in a fairly short time period.
1:37:25
In ’88, by that time, it had become the Oregon/Washington Interagency
1:37:36
Endangered Species Task Force.
1:37:39
They proposed managing for 1,130 sites in Oregon and Washington, with
1:37:47
1,000 acres at each of those sites.
1:37:49
So, the acreage just kept going up and getting bigger and bigger.
1:37:53
Now, what’s the difference that you noticed between Oregon and
1:37:57
Washington in terms of populations?
1:38:00
Well, the spotted owl population in Washington has always been quite a bit
1:38:05
smaller than what it was in Oregon, just because the farther north you go,
1:38:13
much of the habitat, particularly in the Cascades, is high, cold and
1:38:17
simply not good spotted owl habitat.
1:38:18
Well, the North Cascades are more extreme in topography, too.
1:38:22
Right, it’s just not very good habitat.
1:38:24
Same with the Olympic Peninsula, right, to some degree?
1:38:26
The peninsula, from what we can tell,
1:38:33
has these beautiful, low-elevation old-growth forests, at least
1:38:35
historically, but it’s incredibly wet, particularly the west side.
1:38:41
Owls out there, spotted owls, have huge home ranges compared to Oregon
1:38:45
or California, which suggests this habitat is lower quality.
1:38:52
Even though it is old growth, the densities of things like flying
1:38:55
squirrels are lower out there.
1:38:57
You don’t have many wood rats, you don’t have tree voles.
1:38:59
Owls out there are
1:39:03
having a tough time making a living.
1:39:07
How did that compare to what you did up in B.C.?
1:39:09
B.C., same thing.
1:39:12
Were you out on the Coast Range side?
1:39:14
Yeah, that’s the only place.
1:39:15
I got over as far east as
1:39:20
Hope [Brit.
1:39:21
Col.] , that area, but you’re over into the North Cascades
1:39:24
or the interior mountains.
1:39:28
Up there, the densities of spotted owls are incredibly low, in fact,
1:39:32
now, they’re almost all gone.
1:39:34
But even when I was up there in the ‘80s, you had to cover a lot
1:39:38
of ground to find any spotted owls.
1:39:40
And for every spotted owl you find, you’d find three barred owls.
1:39:44
Barred owls were already into B.C. in fairly high numbers by that time.
1:39:50
So, all indications suggest that as you go north into those colder, wetter climates,
1:40:00
the spotted owls just gradually drop out.
1:40:02
They can’t make a living up there.
1:40:04
If you’re mainly a predator on flying squirrels and things like wood rats
1:40:07
and tree voles are pretty uncommon, biomass you have available is pretty low.
1:40:12
And so, it’s just a tougher place for a spotted owl to make a living, certainly.
1:40:15
Now, going back a little bit earlier.
1:40:17
We’re going to transition into the ISC report [Interagency Scientific
1:40:18
Committee for the Northern Spotted Owl] and more here in a minute, but
1:40:22
talk about your personal connections to specific owls, ones that you got to know.
1:40:27
Like, who was “Fat Broad”?
1:40:29
Well, in 1970 when
1:40:33
I still was an undergraduate here, it was the summer I got drafted.
1:40:38
I was definitely very interested in spotted owls.
1:40:45
One day, my girlfriend at the time, Karen, and I, we took a drive out by Philomath.
1:40:52
We went up Greasy Creek.
1:40:55
If you go on through Philomath and you go a little west towards Alsea, there’s
1:41:00
a road that takes off there and goes up a little drainage called Greasy Creek.
1:41:04
We drove up that road, and I’m looking for spotted owls, what
1:41:08
I usually did in those days.
1:41:11
And we came around a corner, and here’s a patch of old growth,
1:41:13
really nice classic old growth.
1:41:16
We got out of the car, stood there looking at the old growth, and I
1:41:19
go, “Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo,” and like
1:41:22
100 yards away, a spotted owl responds back.
1:41:26
It turns out that we were less than about 100 yards from a nest tree.
1:41:32
I went back later with Richard Reynolds, and we found the nest tree.
1:41:38
I climbed the nest tree, got up there, and it had two young.
1:41:44
Both of them had their eyes completely stuck shut with what looked like blood.
1:41:49
It was just kind of these gooey kind of scabs.
1:41:52
Were they deformed or
1:41:53
-- ? No, they looked outwardly healthy.
1:41:57
It turns out later we found out what does it, these hippoboscid
1:42:01
flies that infect young nestlings.
1:42:04
Sometimes they occur at really-high densities.
1:42:08
They bite the little young ones around the eye and on the soft parts of the
1:42:11
eye enough, that they hemorrhage and bleed, and the eyes get stuck shut.
1:42:18
Normally, if you leave them alone, which we didn’t know at the time,
1:42:22
the adults keep feeding them, pretty soon the scabs crack open, and
1:42:25
they’re probably going to be fine.
1:42:26
Unless, sometimes the infestations could be so bad that the young are anemic and
1:42:32
actually have physical problems from that.
1:42:35
But in this case, we didn’t know what it was.
1:42:37
So, we decided we were going to take one of these juveniles home that night, see
1:42:42
if we could clean up its eyes and see what was wrong with it, then take it back the
1:42:46
next day and switch it with the other one.
1:42:48
So, we did that.
1:42:49
This is 1970’s, pre-ESA, pre-National Forest Management
1:42:54
Act, pre- any of these laws.
1:42:56
There were still laws, that I shouldn’t have taken it legally,
1:42:59
but anyway, we took this bird home.
1:43:02
We cleaned its eyes up.
1:43:05
Once we took a warm solution of warm water and vinegar and just kind of kept working
1:43:10
on these scabs until we soaked them loose, the eyes opened up and they’re fine.
1:43:15
So we thought, “Oh, okay, we’ll take it back the next day, put it back in the
1:43:18
nest, and see if we can fix the other one.” And so, we went back the next day. I
1:43:22
climbed up the big old-growth tree again, got up there, and the other juvenile was
1:43:26
dead. We don’t quite know what happened.
1:43:31
We suspected the ravens got in there and killed it, but you would have
1:43:34
thought they would have eaten it.
1:43:37
But we weren’t sure.
1:43:39
But anyway, we sat with this juvenile, a dead juvenile in the
1:43:43
nest, and the adults were still in the area, but they were about, I
1:43:46
don’t know, some ways up the draw.
1:43:49
And so, we hemmed and hawed and decided, okay, we’ll just keep it.
1:43:52
We’ll take it home.
1:43:53
We’ll raise it.
1:43:54
So, that’s what we did.
1:43:55
So that became that bird?
1:43:57
That became Fat Broad, right.
1:43:59
Okay.
1:43:59
And this was in like April.
1:44:02
I got drafted in August, okay.
1:44:05
So, I took this juvenile spotted owl home.
1:44:08
I began to raise it in captivity thinking this is going to be a
1:44:12
really unique experience to learn something about developmental
1:44:17
molt, things like that, which we did.
1:44:18
We started keeping track of its molt right off the bat.
1:44:24
I kept that bird until August, and at that point I got drafted.
1:44:28
And Georgine Reynolds, who was Richard Reynolds’ wife, took on the bird.
1:44:32
Took on the bird.
1:44:34
For the 18 months I was off in the Army, as the bird grew up in their back yard in
1:44:40
a cage there, Georgine took care of it.
1:44:43
I came back two years later and got the bird again.
1:44:47
Georgine, by that time, had named it Fat Broad, I didn’t.
1:44:52
And the reason is—
1:44:53
I was going to say, in an age of political correctness [Laughs].
1:44:55
Oh, yeah, I know, it’s kind of funny, because where the name came
1:45:00
from was the B.C. comic strip.
1:45:05
If you know B.C. [character in comic strip.]
1:45:06
Oh, right.
1:45:06
It still runs in the paper today.
1:45:08
Right, I know, but yeah, and Fat Broad was one of the characters.
1:45:11
Back in those days, the big-old heavy gal with the club that beat on the snake.
1:45:15
Yeah.
1:45:16
They actually referred to her in the comic strip as the Fat Broad.
1:45:21
Okay, so.
1:45:22
And, you know, you could get away with it then.
1:45:23
And that’s where Georgine, because this bird, because she was always well-fed.
1:45:28
Well, blame it on Johnny Hart [creator/cartoonist for B.C.] . Right?
1:45:31
Yep, but this bird was always this little pig because she was very
1:45:34
well-fed and, Georgine started calling her Fat Broad, and I didn’t care.
1:45:40
So, I deny culpability.
1:45:42
It’s not my fault.
1:45:44
But anyway.
1:45:45
What happened to that bird, though?
1:45:47
I kept her.
1:45:47
And she lived
1:45:52
to be 31 years old.
1:45:55
In captivity?
1:45:55
In captivity.
1:45:57
Yeah, she went through a couple different girlfriends, outlasted
1:46:03
them.
1:46:03
She helped raise my kids, you know.
1:46:11
So, this was a real part of the family then?
1:46:12
Yeah,
1:46:14
she moved with us.
1:46:15
It must have been an emotional moment when she passed, huh?
1:46:16
It was, yes.
1:46:17
She moved with us to Washington when I worked up there.
1:46:21
She moved back here to Corvallis.
1:46:23
You know, all my kids left home and she was still there with Monica and I.
1:46:28
That’s longer than they usually live by quite a bit, isn’t it?
1:46:31
In the wild, yeah.
1:46:32
The oldest one we’ve seen in the wild is about 24, I think.
1:46:36
Right.
1:46:41
For the last four or five years of her life she was blind, so I’d have to go
1:46:45
out and she’d eat chicken out of my hand.
1:46:49
But yeah, it was a sad day when she passed on.
1:46:54
So anyway, that was the one that I was probably most attached to.
1:46:59
But there are lots of birds
1:47:00
— Did you have any other names for any of them, or are they all numbers?
1:47:04
All the rest of them were numbers, yeah.
1:47:05
Okay.
1:47:06
I kept quite a few spotted owls in captivity.
1:47:08
I kept a number of barred owls in captivity.
1:47:10
I kept two tawny owls in captivity.
1:47:13
I kept saw whets in captivity.
1:47:13
So, I had a lot.
1:47:17
The other bird that my wife and I got very attached to was a great horned owl.
1:47:24
I got a call from my brother Pete down in Eugene.
1:47:27
He said, “Hey, there is a great gray owl sitting on the swing-set out in the
1:47:30
back yard.” You know, it does not look healthy. So, I drove down to Eugene,
1:47:35
got out and walked out in the back yard, and here’s this great big, fat great
1:47:38
horned owl juvenile with jesses on his legs, the leather jesses that falconers
1:47:44
use when they raise birds in captivity.
1:47:46
Oh, right, yeah.
1:47:46
Somebody had taken that bird out of a nest and raised it, and it got loose.
1:47:52
But it was imprinted by then.
1:47:53
It thought it was a human being.
1:47:55
It was a big-old, imprinted-juvenile great horned owl that somebody had.
1:48:00
Did you ever find out who it was?
1:48:01
Never did.
1:48:02
Brought it home, and Monica and I raised it there in the house.
1:48:08
We had a cage for it.
1:48:11
I eventually just turned it loose there.
1:48:12
We were living out on Elliott Circle, which is out north of town.
1:48:17
I turned it loose out the back door and it hung around all that winter.
1:48:22
It would roost in the pear tree out in the back yard there, and feed on local things.
1:48:28
I picked up pellets, and they’d be full of Norway rats and things like
1:48:31
that from the barns around there.
1:48:34
But, he was an imprint and was unafraid of people.
1:48:39
I’d come home from work in the afternoon or the evening, and during the breeding
1:48:44
season, he would come flying in and land on top of your head and try to copulate.
1:48:48
He’d be up there doing the treading act thing that they do when they sit
1:48:53
on the back of a female, they kind of hold like this and go, “whoo-whoo-ooh.”
1:48:58
He’d be doing that on top of your head.
1:49:00
Foreplay.
1:49:00
Foreplay.
1:49:03
For Monica and me, we were used to it.
1:49:05
But neighbors didn’t appreciate that, you know.
1:49:11
I remember one time, the neighbor guy said, “Hey, I saw your bird.
1:49:15
Had the back of the Chevy station wagon open, and the big-old bird had flown
1:49:21
in there with a rat, gutted it on the floor in the back of his station wagon,
1:49:26
and there were rat guts all over.”
1:49:32
One time we were sitting there and Monica heard a crash out in the kitchen,
1:49:34
we looked out and he’s sitting there.
1:49:37
She had put an avocado seed in a bowl of water, and it had taken root.
1:49:43
And there he sits, he’s got this avocado seed in his mouth with the
1:49:46
roots hanging out one side and the leaves hanging out the other, and
1:49:49
he’s just goofing around with it.
1:49:52
So, he was a character.
1:49:53
What was his name?
1:49:55
He never had a name.
1:49:56
I don’t think I ever called him anything.
1:49:58
Should have called him “Trouble.”
1:49:59
Yeah.
1:50:00
He was hilarious, but he was just always getting in trouble.
1:50:04
Finally, I gave him to a guy who lived up in the Cascades, who said he
1:50:08
was going to try to “hack him” back out into the wild. And, you know,
1:50:12
imprints, they’re pretty-well screwed.
1:50:15
But he took it up there, put it in a cage, and a racoon
1:50:19
got in the case and killed it.
1:50:20
So, that was the end of that great horned owl.
1:50:22
Raccoons are nasty sometimes.
1:50:24
But anyway,
1:50:28
I had a bunch of birds like that in captivity.
1:50:31
Why have owls been associated with being wise?
1:50:36
I think it’s just the way they look.
1:50:37
An anthropomorphic transfer [human perceptions-beliefs]
1:50:38
. Well, I think the wise-old owl, it’s just the expression that owls with the
1:50:44
big eyes that face forward, kind of like a human, and that somber look that
1:50:52
they’re not smiling, they’re kind of giving you that, just
1:50:55
kind of that somber look.
1:50:57
I guess, that’s all I can figure out.
1:50:59
I don’t know.
1:50:59
One of the presents I got with my doctoral graduation, it said “Class
1:51:03
of 2002,” was an owl doll with a little mortar board on its head.
1:51:10
Yeah, yeah.
1:51:11
I don’t know, because they’re not particularly smart.
1:51:13
[Laughs]
1:51:13
I was just going to ask you.
1:51:15
I mean, they’re not dumb, either, but compared to some of the— [birds]
1:51:18
Well, birds’ brains are fairly small compared to their body
1:51:22
size, right, relatively speaking?
1:51:23
I mean, they’re about average for some?
1:51:24
Well, yeah.
1:51:25
There are some birds like crows and ravens and some of the pscittacines,
1:51:28
the parrots, that are actually pretty-darned sharp for birds.
1:51:32
But owls, I think, are probably not quite up there with that group.
1:51:35
Okay, thank you for clearing that up for me.
1:51:37
[Laughs] Just wanted to make sure that I’m not too affected by cultural stereotypes.
1:51:42
So Eric, you’re with the Forest Service now, in ’87.
1:51:47
You’re doing this synthesis work and we’re leading up toward the big events
1:51:52
that would lead to the ISC Report, all the things that would lead up to
1:51:57
the Clinton Summit and even the Gang of Four Report, the congressional
1:52:01
hearings that came from that.
1:52:05
Let’s take you up until you’ve started to get involved with the ISC Report
1:52:10
and worked with Jack Ward Thomas.
1:52:15
So basically, all those lawsuits that happened in the late ’80s that led up to,
1:52:24
actually, I think Dwyer was actually later than that.
1:52:26
That was in ’91.
1:52:26
And you’re talking about the lawsuits before the Seattle one.
1:52:29
The Seattle Audubon Society lawsuit was the one that led to the
1:52:33
injunction, the first Dwyer one.
1:52:35
Then, there was a second one.
1:52:36
Yeah, right.
1:52:36
But you’re talking about the lesser-known lawsuits throughout the ‘80s first.
1:52:40
Right?
1:52:41
Yeah, right.
1:52:42
It was incredibly frustrating because the Forest Service and the BLM were trying
1:52:47
to come up with some kind of a plan that would get them over all the legal
1:52:51
hurdles, and they never quite got there.
1:52:54
They kept getting sued on the grounds that ones they had done were just
1:52:58
not adequate to ensure a viable population of northern spotted owls.
1:53:03
That was part of it.
1:53:03
Now, did you think those lawsuits were fair, or were they just
1:53:07
being done, almost out of spite?
1:53:08
No, I think, if you take the National Forest Management Act
1:53:09
at face value, then I think
1:53:13
they were fair.
1:53:13
Because, the National Forest Management Act said
1:53:23
the Forest Service was supposed to maintain viable populations of all native
1:53:27
vertebrates within a planning area.
1:53:29
Okay?
1:53:31
And, I mean, certainly the environmental groups
1:53:35
wanted to end all harvests, period.
1:53:37
I think, at least a lot of them did, or, if not, something close to that.
1:53:42
So, they were using those laws as much as they could to
1:53:46
try to slow down the harvest.
1:53:48
And they were doing that.
1:53:50
Well, they were doing it.
1:53:50
But, all the way through the mid-‘80s, they were cutting a lot of board-feet,
1:53:57
and even their own foresters
1:54:00
were telling them, this is not sustainable.
1:54:02
You know, you can’t keep setting these artificial targets and expecting us
1:54:06
to meet them, because we can’t do it.
1:54:07
So, it’s basically the Congress and the really top brass in the Forest Service
1:54:11
that were mandating these things?
1:54:12
Yeah, oh, yeah.
1:54:13
Then the lower people were carrying them out.
1:54:15
We can’t keep doing this.
1:54:17
Right?
1:54:17
We can’t meet those targets.
1:54:18
But that’s how the rangers were getting evaluated, by meeting the targets.
1:54:22
If you did, you were a good camper, or a good employee.
1:54:27
So, I think that their own people were telling them we can’t manage
1:54:33
for spotted owls and murrelets and everything else, and meet the
1:54:36
timber targets you guys are setting.
1:54:37
We just can’t do it.
1:54:39
Whenever they went to court, the courts usually looked at
1:54:42
that and said, you guys are not
1:54:47
meeting them from what we know of their populations.
1:54:49
By the early 1990’s, we started
1:54:54
to get some population data, quantitative data, on actual trends
1:54:58
in the spotted owl population.
1:54:59
In other words, the synthesis work that you were part of?
1:55:02
Yeah, and that others were.
1:55:07
Gary White, Ken
1:55:11
Burnham and others were starting to get involved, in terms of starting to
1:55:14
look at the population data we had.
1:55:16
It was pretty minimal data, but there were some indications from
1:55:21
that, despite what the agencies were doing, it was not adequate.
1:55:25
And the population was declining.
1:55:27
Population is just—
1:55:29
Precipitously or steadily declining?
1:55:31
Back in those days, we kind of thought it was relatively gradual, which is
1:55:38
different than what I would say now.
1:55:39
But in those days, we thought it was a relatively low rate of decline.
1:55:43
But, nevertheless, it was declining.
1:55:48
I think the concerns were valid and justified.
1:55:53
The other thing
1:55:56
happening back in the mid to late-‘80s, was the focus
1:56:02
tended to be on single species.
1:56:04
There was a lot of focus on spotted owls and, to a lesser
1:56:07
extent, murrelets and others.
1:56:11
But the elephant in the room was that the law, the National Forest Management
1:56:18
Act [NFMA] , in particular, mandated not a single-species focus, but that
1:56:22
you need to be concerned with the whole range of diversity that was out there.
1:56:28
Until then, the agencies didn’t want to talk about that.
1:56:33
There was kind of this, “Let’s keep the blinders on and focus on what we have to
1:56:37
do with the damned spotted owl,” you know.
1:56:39
And
1:56:42
so, the NFMA, people talk a lot about the ESA, but NFMA really had some teeth to it.
1:56:49
And I think the environmental groups picked up on that pretty quick.
1:56:53
Well, in previous forest management acts, 1944 and 1960 for example, and even going
1:56:58
back further, it actually added something that was beyond merely multiple-use
1:57:05
and the old model [humanistic context] , but you had to add in the biological
1:57:10
components [ecological/holistic context]
1:57:11
. Right, right.
1:57:11
You could no longer say, “Oh, we’re going to be kinder and softer toward
1:57:16
the land, but still do the same thing.” They were actually saying, “Well, no,
1:57:20
this has to be considered as well.” But that was very difficult for
1:57:23
them to retrofit their expectations, as well as their planning models.
1:57:27
Correct?
1:57:28
Yep.
1:57:28
And not only that, but they had to know something about the
1:57:31
species that were out there.
1:57:32
And they didn’t until people did the work.
1:57:34
And they didn’t, that’s right.
1:57:36
By the late ‘80s, we’d done a lot of work on spotted owls and quite a bit
1:57:40
of work on murrelets, but the rest of the stuff that’s out there, they didn’t
1:57:44
know much at all about many of those other old-growth-related species, and
1:57:52
that really put them in a world of hurt.
1:57:54
Now, I think you could say it’s fairly obvious why, but I ask, why did the
1:58:01
spotted owl become the symbol of environmental battles in the Northwest?
1:58:08
Well, if you’ve ever been around spotted owls, I think the answer
1:58:13
to that is kind of obvious.
1:58:14
They’re just an incredibly,
1:58:19
what’s the right word?
1:58:22
Charismatic?
1:58:23
They’re charismatic.
1:58:24
They are unafraid of humans.
1:58:26
You can walk right up to ‘em.
1:58:28
The media loved ‘em because you could take field trips out, and
1:58:31
these owls would come flying in and literally land on your camera, or you
1:58:37
hold a mouse out, and they come in and take it out of your hand.
1:58:40
They’re wild birds that haven’t ever seen a human before.
1:58:43
And even before you got to know these birds, they still did that.
1:58:47
Right?
1:58:48
Yeah, that’s just the way they are.
1:58:51
They’ve evolved in landscapes where historically they probably weren’t exposed
1:58:55
to humans that much, the deep forest.
1:58:57
The natives didn’t go back in those places.
1:59:00
And so, they just are unafraid of people, which can get them in trouble.
1:59:07
They’re just very easy for school kids or media folks or whoever, to go out
1:59:12
and just sit there and commune with this animal that comes right up in your face.
1:59:19
They’re beautiful birds, and they’re very interesting to watch.
1:59:25
Whereas a murrelet, for example, is a seabird that’s out there
1:59:29
in the ocean most of its time.
1:59:31
And when it does come in, it’s way the hell up in a big old-growth
1:59:33
tree, and you can’t see it.
1:59:35
So, it’s kind of hard for a school kid or an Audubon group or whatever,
1:59:41
to see and kind of get up close.
1:59:45
It’s this combination of their behavior and the way they look, and that just
1:59:52
makes it the perfect symbol, I think.
1:59:56
And whereas murrelets spend much of their lives at sea, this bird lives
2:00:00
its entire life in those old forests, and is very kind of retiring, and
2:00:05
unless you know how to go look for them, they’re kind of hard to see.
2:00:09
I think they just were kind of emblematic of this whole, dense,
2:00:13
dark, old forest, even though they’re certainly not restricted
2:00:17
to that kind of forest, it’s where
2:00:21
they’re most abundant.
2:00:22
They nest in these big cavities way up high in these trees, you know.
2:00:26
In addition to the anthropomorphic identifications that people would have
2:00:29
that we’re talking about, “wise owls” and all that cultural baggage, too?
2:00:34
Yeah, I think humans kind of relate to owls in general just because they
2:00:38
kind of look like we do a little bit.
2:00:40
They have these forward-facing eyes and big heads.
2:00:44
That’s what I
2:00:46
meant.
2:00:46
Yeah, it’s kind of something a lot of humans just find neat and cool.
2:00:52
Marty Raphael was telling me about how murrelets, like it’s
2:00:56
really hard to find their nests, and they’re way the heck inland.
2:00:59
Oh, yeah.
2:01:01
They couldn’t even find a nest until the ‘70s, and they finally found,
2:01:04
like one or two, and everybody’s excited, but they’re hard to work with.
2:01:10
They’re difficult to see on land, period, unless you go out there and
2:01:13
stand around at daybreak and listen.
2:01:15
I’ve climbed a lot of murrelet nest trees, and it’s just hard to get up there
2:01:20
and see them, which makes it a whole lot harder to sell them as a symbol.
2:01:30
They’re amazing little animals, with incredible life histories.
2:01:34
But you also have in addition to the symbolism and the human cultural
2:01:38
identifications, you also have the authentic biological, ecological connector
2:01:45
of them as indicator species, correct?
2:01:47
Yeah.
2:01:47
That’s the other thing that I would say, is that they’re a top-level
2:01:52
carnivore in a system where they are very reliant on many of the small mammals
2:01:59
and birds that live in that system.
2:02:01
They feed on those species, so it’s all tied together, it’s all linked in
2:02:05
terms of the structure that they need for nests, the kinds of food they eat.
2:02:11
Often, if you’re a tree vole, they’re more abundant in old
2:02:16
forests, flying squirrels are more abundant generally in old forests.
2:02:20
It’s all kind of linked and the spotted owl is just sort of the symbol for all
2:02:24
these other things further down the food web that we need to be concerned about.
2:02:30
So, yeah, I think they’re a perfect symbol for that system.
2:02:37
Now, I do want you to think about the symbol of the spotted owl versus the
2:02:44
ecological complexity of the real forest, and how that you can puncture holes in
2:02:50
that from, let’s say, an antagonist, anti-preservation perspective . But
2:02:56
we’ll get to that when we’re talking at the very end, about the holes in
2:03:00
the Northwest Forest Plan and problems with implementation, certainly.
2:03:04
But we’ll talk about that later.
2:03:06
Okay.
2:03:06
So,
2:03:08
how did you get involved with the ISC Report and working with Jack Ward Thomas?
2:03:14
Well, I knew all the players.
2:03:17
I’d been involved with all of them on various committees or working groups, I
2:03:23
mean, as sort of the lead researcher on spotted owls in Oregon for the previous—
2:03:31
Fifteen years.
2:03:31
Fifteen years.
2:03:32
I had most of the data these guys were trying to understand and
2:03:37
base their recommendations on.
2:03:38
So, it was just natural for me to end up on those committees.
2:03:43
So, when Jack was selected in 1989, when
2:03:50
the—I’m trying to say, not the Regional Forester, by the
2:03:57
Forest Service Chief
2:03:58
-- Dale Robertson?
2:03:59
In ’89, Forest Service Chief Dale Robertson
2:04:11
and BLM Director Merle Storms said, “We need to put together a committee
2:04:18
of experts to come up with a plan.
2:04:21
We keep going to court and losing in court, so we’ve got to come up with
2:04:23
something that’s defensible.” They appointed Jack as the lead, and Jack
2:04:30
immediately went to people he knew that knew something about spotted owls.
2:04:34
He went to Chuck Meslow, Jerry Verner, Barry Noon, Butch Olendorff, and me.
2:04:51
But Butch got sick,
2:04:54
so Jack then called on Joe Lint from
2:04:59
BLM to take over for
2:05:02
Butch.
2:05:03
So, there were six of us on that committee.
2:05:06
In addition, we had a couple of advisers/observers, including biologist
2:05:08
Larry Irwin from NCASI [National Council for Air and Stream Improvement] , and
2:05:08
ecologist David Wilcove from Princeton.
2:05:08
[phone rings]
2:05:08
[Break in Audio]
2:05:08
So,
2:05:29
we’re back on and will talk more about the process leading up to
2:05:33
the ISC Report and Eric working with Jack Ward Thomas and others.
2:05:37
He had started before we took our short break, and now he’s going to continue.
2:05:43
Basically, because of all the lawsuits in the late ‘80s, it reached the point
2:05:49
where the Forest Service and BLM were just being challenged one time after the next,
2:05:57
to try to come up with a viable plan.
2:05:58
And they kept losing in court.
2:06:03
So finally, the Chief of the Forest Service requested they
2:06:11
initiate the ISC Committee with Jack Thomas in charge.
2:06:18
Actually, it was both the chief of the Forest Service and the national
2:06:22
director of BLM, who jointly requested this committee meet and try to come
2:06:30
up with, once and for all, a holistic plan to manage for spotted owls that
2:06:36
would provide for viable populations.
2:06:42
They were
2:06:45
on a very short time schedule.
2:06:48
Jack was told to get this committee together, and I think he came
2:06:52
up with that report in three months or something like that.
2:06:54
It was a pretty short time.
2:06:54
So, it was similar to all the other reports that came later,
2:06:57
including FEMAT [Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team] , where
2:06:59
everything was on a rushed schedule?
2:07:00
Oh, yeah, incredibly rushed.
2:07:01
We hit the ground running, did a number of field trips to different places in
2:07:06
Oregon, Washington and California, in the first couple of weeks together as a group.
2:07:11
Then we went back to Portland, sat down in the, I forget what that
2:07:17
building is called over there, and in a very short time period, produced
2:07:21
the report we hoped would provide for a viable population of spotted owls.
2:07:22
And that report, or
2:07:33
the recommendation of the committee, ended up being unlike anything that
2:07:37
had been proposed prior to that in terms of how to manage spotted owls.
2:07:40
So, there were six of us on the group with Jack in charge, and
2:07:49
yeah, it there was very much a lot of pressure to get something out quickly.
2:07:57
It brought you back to the days of cramming for or
2:07:59
finishing something in school?
2:08:01
Oh, it was worse than anything I ever did.
2:08:03
Really?
2:08:03
Before, yeah.
2:08:04
Yeah, we—
2:08:05
Oh, was it worse than FEMAT later?
2:08:08
I think, I think—
2:08:11
In terms of the time crunch?
2:08:12
You know, probably not.
2:08:13
But it was just about that bad.
2:08:16
The difference between FEMAT and ISC, was with ISC, there were only six of us.
2:08:22
And we could all sit in the same room together and talk something through and
2:08:27
beat it around and get it worked out.
2:08:29
With FEMAT, it was so huge that a lot of us never even knew people that were
2:08:36
working on other aspects of the plan.
2:08:38
I mean, my little group, we were folks on spotted owls.
2:08:41
You were on terrestrial ecology in FEMAT.
2:08:43
Right?
2:08:43
Yeah, and
2:08:46
there were all the people working on different things,
2:08:51
the sociologists, for example.
2:08:53
I knew of them, but I didn’t know them well.
2:08:58
The economists were off doing their thing, the silviculturists
2:09:01
were off doing their thing.
2:09:02
It was just all over the map.
2:09:04
With FEMAT, the only people that really knew the big picture, were Jack and
2:09:12
Marty Raphael [PNW] , who were kind of in charge, overseeing the whole thing.
2:09:15
The rest of us were focusing on our little pieces of the puzzle.
2:09:19
With ISC, it was a small group of biologists that kind of
2:09:26
tended to think the same way.
2:09:28
There were certainly others in the room, particularly Larry Irwin, who
2:09:35
was a biologist, but very much was representing a different constituency,
2:09:42
and had that bias going for him.
2:09:45
But then, Dave Wilcove was there representing environmental groups, and
2:09:49
he definitely had his agenda, also.
2:09:51
Were any timber group people there?
2:09:53
Nope, well, I would say Larry Irwin is a “timber people” person.
2:09:58
Because he was from within an agency with it?
2:10:00
He works for a consulting firm that is totally focused on timber.
2:10:05
And they tend to produce reports that are supportive of timber agendas.
2:10:11
So, yeah.
2:10:11
Any particular stories or anecdotes, humorous or otherwise, about
2:10:15
the ISC process, about you folks working these long days and nights?
2:10:19
Oh, man, we were stuck up in Portland in motels about half the time, you
2:10:25
know, working incredibly long hours.
2:10:30
The one that impressed me the most of that whole group, was Jerry Verner.
2:10:34
Jerry could go twenty hours a day on almost no sleep and was productive
2:10:39
as heck, in terms of helping us pull things together in terms of the writing.
2:10:44
The
2:10:46
guy was amazing.
2:10:48
He could really put in the hours.
2:10:53
All the guys on that group, I have a lot of respect for.
2:10:57
They are or were a very bright, dedicated bunch of people.
2:11:03
And like I said earlier, Jack Thomas was the right guy for the occasion.
2:11:13
If Jack had not been there in that leadership role, we never would
2:11:18
have gotten things done or gotten the products done that we did.
2:11:23
He had that personality, and he was good with people and incredibly dedicated.
2:11:37
Jack also had a strong moral center.
2:11:40
He wanted to do a good job.
2:11:42
He cared about the resource, he cared about people, and he didn’t
2:11:47
walk in there with an agenda, one way or the other, I don’t think.
2:11:53
He wanted what he thought was best for the long-term survival of the
2:11:58
human species, I think that’s kind of where I think Jack was coming from.
2:12:02
He cared about people, but he really was concerned about maintaining a healthy
2:12:08
environment for the people to live in.
2:12:10
So, that’s kind of where his heart was at.
2:12:16
The ISC Report was kind of a model for what came after.
2:12:23
Am I correct?
2:12:24
Yeah.
2:12:24
The Gang of Four and the FEMAT report was also an EIS for the
2:12:27
spotted owl, like in ’92, right?
2:12:29
Yeah, it formed the model for all of those, I think.
2:12:32
So, the HCA’s, the Habitat Conservation Areas, are essentially analogous to
2:12:37
things that were named differently later on, but connected to the Late
2:12:42
Successional Old-Growth Forest Reserves?
2:12:44
[In Northwest Forest Plan]
2:12:44
Right.
2:12:45
Yeah, that’s what I said earlier about the ISC Report, was kind of the first
2:12:50
time this idea of large reserves surfaced.
2:12:56
Always before with spotted owls, we were talking about habitat or
2:13:02
SOMA’s [Spotted Owl Management Areas] , or these pair-by-pair sorts
2:13:05
of areas that you would protect.
2:13:07
You know, protect a thousand acres here and a thousand acres here, for
2:13:12
individual pairs of spotted owls.
2:13:14
With the ISC Report, we kind of gave up on that approach.
2:13:17
We said, “We can’t manage one pair at a time, we’ve got to manage for these large
2:13:21
reserves,” these areas that will hopefully be relatively resistant to perturbations.
2:13:30
And if they are, if one does burn up, they’re redundant enough that we’ll
2:13:34
have another one nearby that can take up the slack in the short-term
2:13:38
while the other one recovers.
2:13:40
So, this idea of redundancy in the reserve system was kind
2:13:44
of built into that ISC Report.
2:13:47
And the idea was that these reserves, we called them HCA’s, Habitat
2:13:52
Conservation Areas, would be large enough to support on average, twenty
2:13:57
pairs of spotted owls in each one.
2:13:59
And that was based on the 1,000-acre size?
2:14:04
Not really.
2:14:04
Or 2,000?
2:14:05
No, we were assuming more like probably 2,000 to 4,000 acres per pair.
2:14:10
Okay.
2:14:12
These reserves, or HCA’s, were on the order of 40,000 to 100,000 acres.
2:14:16
They were big areas, very large, some even bigger than that.
2:14:22
But
2:14:28
the idea was that they would be big enough to sustain at least twenty pairs
2:14:31
per HCA, and they would be close enough together so that you would get dispersal
2:14:39
in connecting the reserves of the HCA’s, you would get movement between the HCA’s.
2:14:46
So, they wouldn’t become genetically-isolated.
2:14:50
That was kind of the idea that we came up with.
2:14:52
We talked about a whole bunch of other approaches.
2:14:54
I can remember we sat there one day, and talked about if we just
2:14:57
put a six-mile-wide strip all the way down the Cascades, and
2:15:02
just have that be our reserve.
2:15:04
That’s the sort of thing we talked about.
2:15:06
And have another one down the middle of the Coast Range, you
2:15:08
know, just a big, long corridor so that everything’s connected.
2:15:13
And so,
2:15:16
we tossed around all kinds of ideas about continuing to manage for pairs of spotted
2:15:21
owls, or for managing larger reserves that would support three or four pairs of owls,
2:15:27
each in these little pockets, and you have them scattered all over the landscape.
2:15:32
We knocked around all kinds of ideas like that, and finally settled on
2:15:37
this idea of these large reserves.
2:15:40
And
2:15:43
we focused mainly on areas where we knew we had spotted owls or where we
2:15:48
thought we could maintain spotted owls.
2:15:49
But we also talked about other things like forest species composition
2:15:56
and trying to include different species of trees or different
2:16:01
forest composition sorts of things.
2:16:04
Some things like that, but the main focus was on setting up a set of
2:16:08
reserves that would provide for a viable population of spotted owls.
2:16:14
So, you finished this report.
2:16:17
How was it received?
2:16:18
Different groups are going to have different opinions.
2:16:20
Well, yeah.
2:16:21
Yeah.
2:16:21
Give me your best take on what different groups responded?
2:16:25
That summer, I think, was also one that the northern spotted owl finally
2:16:29
was listed as threatened, 1990.
2:16:31
1990.
2:16:33
So, suddenly, they had that issue to deal with as well.
2:16:39
The initial reception was kind of lukewarm from the agencies.
2:16:43
The
2:16:49
timber industry hated it because it was going to have a big impact on the cut.
2:16:53
Environmental groups hated it because it still allowed a fair
2:16:57
amount of cutting in old growth.
2:17:00
Those two groups came at it from opposite directions.
2:17:03
Didn’t it get litigated from both sides?
2:17:05
Yeah, but it’s kind of funny, it ended up,
2:17:11
I don’t even remember all the details, but they got sued.
2:17:18
Basically, the environmental groups challenged that plan on the
2:17:21
grounds it didn’t satisfy NFMA.
2:17:24
To my recollection, the main criticism was that it’s a single species plan,
2:17:30
and it doesn’t deal with all the other species of vertebrates that are out there.
2:17:34
And NFMA says you will manage for viable populations of all native birds.
2:17:40
And that’s why Judge Dwyer agreed to it, right?
2:17:42
And Judge Dwyer said, “You’re right.” He said these guys, you know, we
2:17:45
thought that people would look at our plan, the ISC plan, and say,
2:17:48
“Well, yeah, it’s owl-centric, look how big these reserves are.
2:17:53
These guys did think about more than just spotted owls.” Which we did.
2:17:58
We thought, “Jesus, these kind of reserves [large sizes] , there’s going
2:18:01
to be plenty of flying squirrels and tree voles and all these other species
2:18:06
in these reserves that it probably will maintain viable populations of a lot
2:18:10
of species,” most of the species we were concerned about. But, you know,
2:18:15
the murrelet folks weren’t happy.
2:18:17
They said, “Well, there’s all this terrestrial stuff and it doesn’t have
2:18:21
the reserves in the right places for murrelets,” and blah, blah, blah.
2:18:24
So, they were complaining about that, you know, again.
2:18:27
This is the environmental community side?
2:18:28
This is the scientific community that works on murrelets.
2:18:30
Science, okay.
2:18:31
Yeah, people like Kim Nelson over here were saying, “Well, you just
2:18:33
focused on spotted owls, you dumb shits,” you know, “you should have
2:18:37
been thinking about murrelets more.
2:18:39
And obviously, you didn’t protect all these habitats that are close to the
2:18:43
coast where we think murrelets are going to be,” and blah, blah, blah.
2:18:47
So, immediately, all these different groups started taking pot-shots
2:18:52
at it for different reasons.
2:18:55
And then Judge Dwyer rules, “Well, okay, you’re not satisfying NFMA, you need
2:18:59
to basically quit cutting old growth.”
2:19:04
That’s when the shut-down happened.
2:19:05
Right?
2:19:06
That’s when the shut-down happened.
2:19:07
And that was in, I think about 1991.
2:19:09
He said, “You don’t cut any more on the national forests until you come
2:19:15
up with a plan that follows the law.”
2:19:17
What do you remember about the reaction from timber communities or
2:19:24
the timber industry, but especially the local communities in the mountains?
2:19:27
And of course, you were working and would go out and be in these areas.
2:19:32
I don’t know how much you ever got to know people around, or they knew what you did.
2:19:36
What do you remember about that dynamic?
2:19:39
They were incredibly angry and frustrated and fearful, that these
2:19:47
kinds of changes coming down the pike were going to change things, as for
2:19:52
the last fifteen to twenty years, they had been on the crest of the wave.
2:19:57
I mean, they were cutting trees like there was no tomorrow, and everybody had work.
2:20:02
There were a lot of jobs.
2:20:05
I can remember driving from Port Angeles to Forks, Washington, to go to my study
2:20:10
area, and having fifty log trucks pass me in that hour between Port Angeles
2:20:16
and Forks, coming west from the coast.
2:20:19
From the
2:20:24
perspective of the small, local towns out there in the hinterland,
2:20:31
what had been going on was what they had grown accustomed to.
2:20:36
And the idea that this would change, or it meant people were going to lose jobs,
2:20:41
and there’s just no two ways about it.
2:20:45
That, plus mechanization in the mills, meant fewer jobs in the mills,
2:20:51
fewer jobs for loggers in the woods.
2:20:52
And yeah, I think those fears were certainly valid.
2:20:58
If you’d been living out there your whole life, you grew up in Forks, your
2:21:04
dad had been a logger, and you had planned on making a living as a logger,
2:21:08
and all of a sudden they’re saying, we’re not going to be cutting trees.
2:21:11
Did you ever receive a lot of hostility when people knew who you
2:21:16
were, the “owl guy,” for instance?
2:21:19
Oh,
2:21:22
I can remember being in some situations where it was very tense.
2:21:26
But, I never got physically threatened.
2:21:30
I can remember being in court on that court case up in Washington.
2:21:34
I can remember; Jack and I testified.
2:21:38
Was this after the ISC?
2:21:39
I think it was after ISC.
2:21:42
Jack was up on the stand and they opened the courtroom to let people in.
2:21:46
Tons of people were outside demonstrating, and they let them file
2:21:49
through the back of the courtroom.
2:21:52
I remember this guy walking across the back of the courtroom and he’s got his
2:21:55
little year-old baby, holding his baby up, as he’s walking across the back.
2:21:59
Like you’re taking food out of the mouth of my family?
2:22:01
Exactly.
2:22:01
Yeah, you’re destroying my family.
2:22:05
And I had
2:22:10
my crews out in the field.
2:22:12
I think the worst was out in the Olympic Peninsula in the early ‘90s.
2:22:17
We were doing telemetry out there, late 1989 to ’71 or
2:22:22
so.
2:22:22
You mean, ’91.
2:22:22
I’m sorry.
2:22:22
You said seventy.
2:22:24
Okay, 1990, about 1989 through ’91 or so,
2:22:35
we were doing telemetry.
2:22:35
At the height of all this?
2:22:36
Yeah, and my crews a couple times were threatened.
2:22:40
I remember, Doreen had a crummy load of loggers coming down the road.
2:22:45
[“Crummy” is vehicle to carry forest work crews] She was out early in the
2:22:46
morning doing telemetry by herself, this crummy stops and this guy
2:22:50
starts yelling at her out the window, “Blah, blah, blah, I’ll run your
2:22:53
damn car off,” that kind of stuff.
2:22:55
He’s threatening a Forest Service employee.
2:22:57
He’s logging on Forest Service lands.
2:23:01
We talked to the district ranger, the ranger went out and talked to
2:23:04
the crew, and that got stopped.
2:23:05
But, I can remember, one guy that worked on my crew up at Forks.
2:23:12
He said he was standing there on the land, getting locations one day, and this
2:23:17
four-by-four goes by and the guy just flips him the bird as he’s going past him.
2:23:21
That kind of shit, you know.
2:23:26
That was at the same time when there were a few owls killed by people.
2:23:30
We don’t know who killed them, but….
2:23:31
And that’s what I was going to ask you about.
2:23:32
Were there just some intentional, vicious killings of owls?
2:23:34
Yeah,
2:23:36
there was a little of that.
2:23:37
I don’t think it was ever very large-scale, but there was a case where
2:23:42
they killed what they’d thought was a spotted owl, and hung it on a kiosk near
2:23:48
a
2:23:51
visitor center near the [Olympic]
2:23:59
national park.
2:24:06
They’d thought they’d shot a spotted owl, but it was a barred owl.
2:24:08
They screwed up.
2:24:10
But then, Ivy [co-worker] and I found two babies [spotted owl]
2:24:12
that had been clubbed to death.
2:24:13
We were pretty sure they [citizens angry about political situation] did that.
2:24:15
We could never prove it.
2:24:22
When we worked in the woods those years, on the peninsula or anywhere,
2:24:28
we kept a low profile and didn’t go out of our way to advertise what we did.
2:24:33
The people knew we were there, but we never had any physical altercations.
2:24:40
A few times, people fired guns in the air at night when
2:24:45
people [researchers] were trying to call for owls.
2:24:51
I think we’re seeing in this country right now, a violent counter-reaction
2:24:56
to everything post-modern.
2:24:57
And I think the Bundy [rancher family from Nevada] dynamic, I think, really
2:25:03
reflected what happened in the election.
2:25:05
Yeah.
2:25:06
I don’t mean to get too sideways here.
2:25:07
No, no.
2:25:08
But I’m making a relational point to you and federal employees being
2:25:13
concerned about their safety in this environment, even more so
2:25:18
than when you were talking about.
2:25:19
Yeah,
2:25:22
to me, the Bundy stuff plays, fits right in with what we’re seeing
2:25:26
with Trump, that whole group.
2:25:30
This idea that we would take these federal lands and turn them over to
2:25:32
states, which I think, that’s what worries me most about Trump, is he
2:25:38
would be receptive to that kind of crap.
2:25:41
If some of those people in his administration, the Bundy types
2:25:45
and the states’ rights type people, suggest that to him, I’m guessing
2:25:52
he’d say, “Well, that makes sense to me, turn it over to the states.” Once
2:25:56
you’ve done that, you’ve lost all the federal lands. It’s just…..yeah.
2:26:01
Anyway, turning back to the early ‘90s,
2:26:07
what do you remember about the whole thing that led up to the Clinton Summit?
2:26:12
There was the Seattle Audubon lawsuit, there was the Dwyer injunction, the
2:26:16
first, and then there was the second, and now, you guys did an EIS somewhere
2:26:20
in the middle of all that, correct?
2:26:21
After ISC on just the owl; am I correct?
2:26:24
I didn’t.
2:26:24
Well, we did a couple of different efforts.
2:26:29
We did a paper that we called the Scientific Review Committee, or SAT,
2:26:40
Scientific Advisory Team, was our report where we looked at [other species]
2:26:46
, because the ISC Report was challenged because it only focused on spotted owls.
2:26:54
The agencies said, “Okay, what other species do we have to be worried about?”
2:26:59
And so, we did a report, and again, Jack Thomas was in charge. And it’s the
2:27:03
SAT Report where we came up with these lists of all potential species that we
2:27:10
thought were associated with old forests.
2:27:13
So, that was one report we did.
2:27:16
Grant Gunderson was on that one.
2:27:17
And that’s before FEMAT by a year or so, right?
2:27:19
Yeah, because we did the SAT Report.
2:27:21
And we did the RAT Report, which was the Re-Assessment Team Report, where we
2:27:27
looked at just the Olympic Peninsula, and we tried to assess whether or not
2:27:32
that population would be viable given the distribution of reserves and stuff.
2:27:37
So, that was another one we did.
2:27:40
Those are the two that I can remember.
2:27:43
I don’t remember anything to do with the agency,
2:27:48
you know, reviews and stuff.
2:27:50
I kind of stayed out of that.
2:27:51
I tried to just get involved as a scientist in all of this.
2:27:55
I tried to stay out of the management parts of it, just tried to provide
2:27:59
the input they needed to develop plans and not get too involved
2:28:03
in the nitty-gritty of coming [up with] , like all the various [options]
2:28:08
. Now, what did you know about the whole Gang of Four dynamic?
2:28:10
Okay.
2:28:10
In other words, going back to go before Congress.
2:28:14
[They interacted with congressional members and committees]
2:28:15
Right.
2:28:15
And there was this report by the “Gang of Four,” then the “Gang of Four Plus
2:28:18
Two,” Sedell and Gordie Reeves were added [to represent aquatic issues] . But
2:28:23
what do you remember about this whole dynamic, this report, and how well do
2:28:27
you think this report addressed the owl and any of the other commensurate issues?
2:28:34
Their focus was on old forests and trying to maintain old forests and the
2:28:39
full range of species composition of old forests in the Pacific Northwest.
2:28:44
So, that was the main focus.
2:28:48
I went over maps with those guys.
2:28:51
I sat there with Jerry, and he’d be standing there saying,
2:28:55
“Okay, what do you think about tweaking the boundaries on that
2:29:00
habitat conservation area to capture this little bit of old growth over here?”
2:29:05
That’s the kind of stuff we did. We looked at the areas they were concerned
2:29:09
about, they came to us, and we sat, Chuck and I, and I don’t remember who else.
2:29:13
Charles Meslow, right?
2:29:13
Chuck, yeah.
2:29:15
We sat down and said, “Well, okay, here’s this HCA,” but right over here is a patch
2:29:20
of beautiful old growth the Gang of Four wanted to capture, and “could we tweak
2:29:25
that boundary a little bit to bring in that and cut off some over here?” For
2:29:30
the most part, we said, “Yeah, fine.”
2:29:32
A lot of horse-trading, in other words.
2:29:32
A lot of horse trading, yeah.
2:29:34
Which I said, I didn’t care.
2:29:35
I thought and felt like that the reserve network was so robust, that tweaking some
2:29:41
boundaries one way or the other was okay.
2:29:42
You’re talking about the ISC?
2:29:43
ISC.
2:29:44
The HCA reserve idea concept, okay, right.
2:29:47
Yeah, I kind of felt, hey, man, tweaking some boundaries is just, you know.
2:29:51
[Acceptable]
2:29:51
So, basically, they called them Old Growth Late Successional Reserves.
2:29:55
[In Northwest Forest Plan]
2:29:55
Right, right.
2:29:55
You guys called them HCA’s, but they’re analogous, more or less.
2:29:58
Yeah, and we kind of tried to merge it to where we could, we made
2:30:00
them match up, so that you didn’t, you know, that’s kind of from my
2:30:04
recollection of that, my involvement with that with the Gang of Four.
2:30:12
I looked at the preserve network to be a pretty robust system and I wasn’t too
2:30:18
worried about trying to integrate the concerns with other forest types and
2:30:23
that sort of thing with what we had done.
2:30:26
I thought all of it was an order of magnitude better than what
2:30:29
we started out with back in
2:30:33
1972.
2:30:33
Twenty years.
2:30:35
Yeah, they’d started from nothing and essentially a focus on [owls] . Like
2:30:40
when I started working on spotted owls on the Siuslaw National Forest,
2:30:45
Carlos Pinto was the biologist.
2:30:49
Anyway, we talked about their existing plan.
2:30:55
This would have been the early ‘70s, for the Siuslaw National Forest, in
2:30:59
terms of the long-term objective, and it was to convert ninety-five
2:31:03
percent of the forest, basically into
2:31:08
early seral,
2:31:12
and only have about five percent of the forest in some kind of reserve status.
2:31:16
It
2:31:20
was totally a focus on forestry and producing wood volume, especially on
2:31:28
the Siuslaw.
2:31:29
What we’re talking about here with ISC and the Gang of Four, is
2:31:33
just an order of magnitude change.
2:31:36
What was the dynamic in the 1980’s in the Mapleton Ranger District that had to do
2:31:40
with, I think it was the early phases of the Endangered Species Act and the owl, or
2:31:47
maybe it was connected to something else where they were going to allow a certain
2:31:50
area to be cut, and then they weren’t?
2:31:52
And there was a negotiation, where they started, and then they went ahead with it.
2:31:55
Was it in the mid-80’s?
2:31:56
Mid-80’s?
2:31:57
Yeah.
2:31:57
Oh, gosh, I don’t remember that.
2:31:59
I do know that on the south end of the Siuslaw, back in those years, they
2:32:04
were getting challenged more from the standpoint of soil stability and landscape
2:32:13
stability issues, than they were owls.
2:32:16
The country was steep and they were concerned about landslides,
2:32:19
and they got pushed pretty hard, I think, to not log a lot of that.
2:32:24
And of course, we just had that fatal landslide in Florence two years ago.
2:32:29
Yeah, yeah.
2:32:29
Where that woman’s house was buried basically.
2:32:30
Yeah.
2:32:33
And they’re suing now.
2:32:35
I’m not sure who.
2:32:35
But anyway, that was a big part of it back in those days, the
2:32:42
landscape issues, as much as owls.
2:32:44
[The Mapleton Ranger District case had to do with clearcutting and roads
2:32:44
increasing landslides that damaged salmon habitat in the Siuslaw River watershed.]
2:32:44
Especially because of the high saturation due to the rain, right?
2:32:46
Yeah.
2:32:48
And I don’t recall if the issues with the thing you’re talking about, was somehow
2:32:51
related to that, or was related to owls, I don’t remember that particular situation.
2:33:03
Okay, you want to talk a little bit about the “God Squad,” which
2:33:06
was essentially a BLM entity, am I correct, or was it interagency?
2:33:10
Yes.
2:33:11
Well, basically, the BLM.
2:33:14
I don’t recall the exact details, but they wanted a bunch of exemptions
2:33:18
from restrictions on timber sales.
2:33:22
When they got denied, they requested that the “God Squad” be brought
2:33:29
together and rule on the issue.
2:33:31
The God Squad [reference] is when
2:33:37
a group of very high level federal appointees who evaluate a situation
2:33:45
and make a decision.
2:33:46
That happened in 1992, after ISC.
2:33:50
And it was basically a pejorative term to people that think they have the “power of
2:33:54
God” to determine who lives and who dies?
2:33:57
That’s right, yeah.
2:33:57
Right, it’s when all else fails, you bring in the “god.”
2:34:04
Kind of like Nero and the Coliseum.
2:34:06
Thumbs up or thumbs down.
2:34:07
Right?
2:34:08
Yeah, and I don’t remember the exact outcome of that whole proceedings, but
2:34:14
I do know that once more, the outcome suggested that they couldn’t keep cutting
2:34:20
BLM lands like they were or had been, and then we’re going to end up in court again.
2:34:25
So, again, this is just before Clinton shows up and tries to fix the problem.
2:34:31
So, were you impressed with the Gang of Four Report?
2:34:36
Yeah, I think those guys did a good job.
2:34:40
They came into it wanting to do, I think, good things for the environment, but also,
2:34:50
they were concerned about the long-term effects on the timber industry.
2:34:55
So, they tried to produce a plan that would solve both problems long-term,
2:35:02
but recognizing, I think, that any of this was going to have a pretty
2:35:07
good, a pretty significant effect on timber in terms of the annual cut.
2:35:13
So, yeah.
2:35:15
Okay, we’re after the Gang of Four, and in ’92, Bush goes out
2:35:19
of office, and Clinton is elected.
2:35:20
And Clinton, as part of his campaign during a stop in the Northwest, promises
2:35:25
to do something about this thing that’s peaking, or it’s continuing to peak for
2:35:30
several years, but it’s just a series of peaks and political intensity.
2:35:34
And he said he’d do that, well, right afterwards, he actually did,
2:35:38
and convened the Forest Summit.
2:35:39
Correct?
2:35:40
Yeah, that’s right, and despite all the flack that Bill Clinton took because of
2:35:46
his other little issues along the way, I continue to maintain that in terms
2:35:51
of our environment, he did a remarkable job in terms of trying to solve the
2:35:58
problem here in the Pacific Northwest.
2:35:59
I think he was somewhat naïve, in particular, because
2:36:00
he came in and said, “Hey,
2:36:05
I’m going to try to fix this problem.
2:36:06
You’ve guys have been struggling, fighting over this now for almost
2:36:09
thirty years, and I’m going to pull together a team and they are going to
2:36:13
fix this problem, once and for all.
2:36:14
We’re going to come up with a plan that will beat the law, will also
2:36:19
provide for a healthy environment, and also will provide jobs for local
2:36:24
communities.” That’s what he said.
2:36:25
That’s what he wanted.
2:36:28
You know, and he jumped into it, and came out here and had his forest conference.
2:36:33
Then Meslow and all the high muckety-mucks went up there, sat and talked for a day.
2:36:38
[Clinton Summit]
2:36:38
Were you there?
2:36:40
I stayed out of it.
2:36:41
I didn’t -- [Laughs]
2:36:43
Did you ever testify before Congress, by the way?
2:36:46
I have never testified before Congress.
2:36:48
Okay.
2:36:48
I have gone back, the
2:36:55
ISC Committee went back and met with a bunch of the high-level administrators,
2:37:00
but Jack did most of the talking.
2:37:03
So, you left that to the higher people up, like Jack and Jerry
2:37:08
and Norm and all those guys?
2:37:09
Yeah, those guys loved that stuff.
2:37:11
I’m more, just let me work on my owls and write up my reports, and leave me alone.
2:37:16
I’m much less of a dynamic personality in terms of getting up
2:37:21
there in front of a bunch of, you know, congressmen or senators, and
2:37:26
being able to bullshit with them.
2:37:27
Jack was a master, and Jerry’s not bad, but Jack is a master.
2:37:33
[Laughs]
2:37:34
Yeah, I’ve heard that, about how he was a big personality
2:37:37
and he liked to play a room.
2:37:40
Is that a fair assessment?
2:37:41
Yeah, he’s good at it, yeah.
2:37:45
So, anyway, well, where was I?
2:37:47
We were talking about the Clinton Summit and you segued into that and I asked you
2:37:51
if you had testified before Congress, because several of the other people
2:37:55
I’ve interviewed did testify back there.
2:37:57
But, Clinton basically said, “Okay, you’re going to pull together this
2:38:04
group and you’re going to come up with a solution.” So, the Forest Service
2:38:08
and the BLM and Fish and Wildlife Service, all those different groups,
2:38:12
basically came together, and under Jack’s leadership pulled together this team.
2:38:22
And we had very, very little time to get out the report.
2:38:26
It was crazy.
2:38:27
And this is the FEMAT dynamic?
2:38:28
This is the FEMAT, yep.
2:38:29
So,
2:38:32
they had the summit, and approximately how long was it before when you were
2:38:35
given your sixty days, initially.
2:38:38
Oh, gosh, yeah.
2:38:39
It was—
2:38:41
Wasn’t it a month or so?
2:38:41
Yeah, it was really fast.
2:38:44
And
2:38:47
we did.
2:38:48
And this time, instead of just being six biologists sitting in
2:38:53
a room, it was hundreds of people from all different interest groups.
2:39:00
Well, you rented a whole floor in the big bank building?
2:39:03
In the “Pink Tower” in Portland [U.S. Bank building] and, yeah, I mean, we had
2:39:07
every kind of “ologist” you can imagine.
2:39:09
This time fisheries played a big part in the development of the plan.
2:39:14
Because they were not involved with the ISC.
2:39:17
That was a small group.
2:39:17
I mean, we talked to them in ISC, but not in FEMAT.
2:39:20
You know, Sedell and those guys were there the whole time.
2:39:24
Well, this is an outgrowth of the Gang of Four thing, because when
2:39:26
they were testifying back there [in Congress] , apparently Norm and Jerry
2:39:29
both told me that congressman and even some other people, said you’ve
2:39:34
got to the fish people involved.
2:39:35
Right, right.
2:39:36
Because we can have all this other stuff for the owl and all the terrestrial.
2:39:40
You’re going to get sued if you don’t deal with fish.
2:39:42
Yeah, essentially, that’s what they said.
2:39:44
And so, they were the ones that brought that in, so the
2:39:47
whole thing comes together.
2:39:49
You’re in the pink tower; tell me about that experience.
2:39:54
Okay, again, it’s kind of a blur, as we had a very short time to get things done.
2:40:00
We had to do all kinds of bringing in outside experts to help us
2:40:04
evaluate different species and how they were likely to perform under
2:40:09
different kinds of alternatives.
2:40:14
I don’t recall specific discussions, but from the very outset, I think we
2:40:20
all pretty much agreed that this was what we were going to be proposing.
2:40:25
I mean, the President wanted more than one option.
2:40:28
He wanted options in terms of that he could choose from.
2:40:32
But I think we all pretty much were resigned to the fact that our
2:40:36
options were going to be based on some kind of big reserve system.
2:40:40
Similar to the Gang of Four report?
2:40:42
Similar to the Gang of Four and ISC.
2:40:44
ISC, right.
2:40:47
I think we all thought, we’ve got to have these reserves for terrestrial
2:40:51
species, but we’ve got to be worried about fish and all those connecting
2:40:55
waterways that cut up the landscape.
2:40:59
And so, our reserve system got to be some combination of these terrestrial
2:41:02
reserves and aquatic reserves.
2:41:07
From there, we just kind of played around with different combinations.
2:41:09
I mean, we came up with a total of ten different options that ranged
2:41:14
all the way from what we called “big green,” I think, if I remember right.
2:41:17
Or the “green dream.” [Reference by FEMAT participants for most
2:41:17
environmentally-friendly option.]
2:41:17
The “green dream,” which is everything pretty much is off limits
2:41:21
to business as usual, you know.
2:41:26
Alternative 9 was closer to the green dream.
2:41:29
It was.
2:41:29
Than it was to the other end.
2:41:31
Right?
2:41:31
Option 9, definitely.
2:41:33
Chose option 9 [Alternative] as it turned out.
2:41:35
Do you want to look at the map here?
2:41:37
Nah, I don’t need to look at it.
2:41:38
Okay.
2:41:39
It basically tied up about 85 percent of the federal lands within the range
2:41:45
of the spotted owl reserve network, either in a terrestrial HCA kind
2:41:52
of, or Habitat Conservation Area kind of reserve, or some kind of an
2:41:56
aquatic riparian reserve, where you’re dealing with corridors along streams.
2:42:02
The aquatic reserves were never mapped, so it’s kind of hard to tell
2:42:05
exactly where they were, but the combination of those things, wilderness,
2:42:12
outright spotted owl reserve, or whatever aquatic riparian and the
2:42:20
various landscapes that have some kind of restrictions on them because of
2:42:23
just harvest issues, steepness [slope] or whatever, like 85 percent of the
2:42:27
federal lands ended up in with some fairly major restrictions on harvest.
2:42:33
And that’s not far from the green dream.
2:42:37
So, when you saw Alternative 9, you came out of this experience with,
2:42:43
what, Alternative 9, as an owl guy.
2:42:47
Knowing the demography and habits as well as anybody, did
2:42:53
you feel that this was adequate?
2:42:58
I felt, in terms of spotted owls, pretty much in terms of
2:43:02
everything, I thought, wow,
2:43:09
there’s no way we could do any better than this.
2:43:13
In fact, I thought, wow, if anything, probably this is more than we need
2:43:18
for spotted owls, for example, that given all of the other concerns we
2:43:23
have about jobs and timber production.
2:43:27
And you’re referring mainly just to the reserves, for the most part?
2:43:31
Right?
2:43:32
Yeah.
2:43:33
Because there’s the other lands, the Matrix, and the AMA’s, and so on?
2:43:36
Yeah, well, again, I thought at the time, being naïve, that if they truly
2:43:44
did manage that Matrix land like we specified in option 9 that they would
2:43:51
be able to meet their harvest targets.
2:43:54
And that’s, I think, where we all were a little bit naive because, obviously,
2:43:59
that hasn’t happened in a lot of those matrix lands because of court challenges,
2:44:05
or legal challenges, ended up not getting
2:44:10
harvested.
2:44:10
As a result, we’ve never really come close to meeting the harvest targets
2:44:14
that were specified in the plan.
2:44:16
Now, Jerry told me that he called them the “B Team,” in other words, the people that
2:44:22
did the next level of recommendations.
2:44:24
Right.
2:44:24
Would that be the Standards and Guidelines?
2:44:26
[NWFP Implementation rules and guidelines]
2:44:26
Probably, yeah.
2:44:28
And Jack, I guess, felt the same way, that they originally had what
2:44:32
they called a coarse filter for how this would be implemented in
2:44:37
terms of management for species and biodiversity and forest health.
2:44:41
But, when they added “survey and manage” [surveys for hundreds of
2:44:44
designated species] , and all other potential species, even including
2:44:47
invertebrates, that Jerry and Jack both had the same opinion.
2:44:52
I think, that it was not a death knell, but it was going to be very
2:44:56
problematic to manage realistically.
2:44:59
It was.
2:44:59
Yeah, it was.
2:45:00
I agree with that.
2:45:01
I think the survey and manage did some amazing stuff in terms of, I mean, the
2:45:06
positive thing about survey and manage was it forced the agencies for the first time
2:45:12
to really conduct a bunch of field work to figure out where these species occurred,
2:45:18
how common there were, and so on.
2:45:24
So, in just a short span of a few years, we learned a lot about quite a few
2:45:29
species, tree voles in particular, that we never would have had we not done that.
2:45:35
Because they did tree vole surveys all over the region, I’ve been able
2:45:39
to publish monographs and because now we know a hell of a lot more about
2:45:44
those species than we did before.
2:45:45
The same thing is true of mollusks and a bunch of things.
2:45:48
So, from that perspective, I think survey and manage was great.
2:45:51
From a scientific perspective, I would say, yes.
2:45:53
But
2:45:56
from the effects on the ability to harvest on those lands, yeah, it
2:46:00
just knocked holes in everything.
2:46:02
I mean, the requirements that they protect tree vole nests in their
2:46:06
proposed timber sales, you’re going to find them pretty much all over the
2:46:11
place, not abundant, but here and there.
2:46:15
My first reaction, Eric, when I first started preparing for this project,
2:46:19
knowing I was going to have to read a whole bunch of stuff and become
2:46:23
enough of an expert to be a really intelligent interviewer, when I saw
2:46:27
the survey and management thing, before I even knew what this was, I
2:46:31
said, how is that realistically doable by agencies that have limitations on
2:46:37
labor, time, capital, money, etc.?
2:46:40
That was my first reaction.
2:46:41
Yeah.
2:46:41
And for a few years, they got some funding to do it, but
2:46:49
once they started doing it, and it started to impact timber
2:46:53
sales, then it just became very difficult to cut much of anything.
2:46:58
And so, yeah,
2:47:03
they didn’t meet their targets, or they didn’t meet the 1.2 billion
2:47:06
board-feet a year or come anywhere close to that, which we, or the ISC group
2:47:12
had sort of implied we could do, and
2:47:19
we’re still dealing with that and we’re still not cutting much.
2:47:23
We’re
2:47:26
not dealing with fire very well also.
2:47:29
Why are we not dealing with fire well?
2:47:31
Because things are so paralyzed that even intelligent thinning and other
2:47:37
type projects are problematic, also.
2:47:39
Would that be true?
2:47:39
Well, that’s part of it, but I think just socially, it’s very difficult for
2:47:46
the agencies to do what it would take to deal with fire very effectively.
2:47:51
You would have to do some pretty dramatic things to the landscape,
2:47:55
and they get challenged every time they try to do anything like that.
2:47:59
Plus, I think they’re not very good at planning in terms of taking
2:48:04
a whole landscape and saying, we’re going to do this, this and
2:48:06
this, and then sticking to it.
2:48:08
But on top of that, with climate change, and that’s got us into a whole other
2:48:15
ball game, I think, in terms of fire.
2:48:17
It’s just going to keep getting worse, if the climate continues to warm
2:48:21
and we get these long, dry summers.
2:48:23
Now,
2:48:31
did you come out, or did you feel that the team came out, but also you and your,
2:48:36
and the owls but also the terrestrial ecology area, do you feel that what you
2:48:40
guys came out with was a successful plan?
2:48:46
I think it was successful or has been successful in some respects.
2:48:52
I think the plan has done a good job of protecting habitat for a lot of species
2:49:00
that occur, both plant and animal, that occur here in the Pacific Northwest.
2:49:09
It has, but walking out of the room, I thought it was going to be a successful
2:49:17
plan, I thought it would maintain spotted owls in the long run, I thought it would
2:49:21
do a good job of protecting virtually all the terrestrial vertebrates that
2:49:24
we have, murrelets, things like that.
2:49:28
Plants, for sure.
2:49:31
I was concerned
2:49:34
that it was not going to produce as much wood volume as was being predicted, not
2:49:42
so much because of the lawsuits that have happened, things like that, just because
2:49:47
I was concerned that our estimates were rosy, that just to be able to produce
2:49:51
that much wood was going to be difficult.
2:49:53
Basically, out of highly diminished areas?
2:49:56
[Potential acres for sale/harvest]
2:49:56
Yeah, yeah.
2:49:56
Areas.
2:49:56
Yeah.
2:49:56
So,
2:50:00
I was concerned about that.
2:50:04
But, I also kind of felt like I’ve felt with ISC, that this plan was just going
2:50:14
to be a stop-gap measure on the way to eventually developing a plan that was much
2:50:21
more integrated and much more holistic.
2:50:27
Tell me what you mean by integrated and holistic.
2:50:28
I mean, a plan where the whole landscape is fair game, where everything
2:50:35
is part of your reserve network.
2:50:38
You mean, independent of ownership in terms of the state?
2:50:41
No.
2:50:41
Oh, okay, all federal lands.
2:50:43
The ownership is hopeless.
2:50:45
It’s
2:50:47
my opinion that once we start talking about private lands,
2:50:51
you simply can’t do anything.
2:50:52
Because that’s just the way it is.
2:50:53
The way land ownership is in this country, you can’t mandate to those
2:50:58
[private lands] , other than, as long as they maintain fairly good water
2:51:01
quality, and don’t destroy their land,
2:51:08
then there’s really not much you can do.
2:51:11
But, in terms of the federal lands,
2:51:17
where I thought we were going, where I still think we’re going is a landscape
2:51:22
where every inch of the federal land ownership sort is part of the plan.
2:51:31
And you have a long-term plan for moving patches of forest and waterways
2:51:39
in and out of your reserve network, depending upon what happens at the
2:51:43
time, where they are, how they’re distributed and so on and so forth.
2:51:46
And the comparative ages of the stands?
2:51:47
And the age of the stands, yeah.
2:51:51
Maybe that’s too Pollyanna, I don’t know.
2:51:54
But that’s kind of where I keep thinking we should end up,
2:52:00
except for wilderness areas and national parks that are sort of hands-off.
2:52:05
That nothing is hands-off forever, that everything
2:52:09
eventually gets somehow managed.
2:52:13
And again, maybe that’s just too Pollyanna.
2:52:17
People just don’t trust the agencies enough to do that, I don’t know.
2:52:20
But anyway, I kind of felt like walking out of FEMAT that we had a pretty good
2:52:26
plan, if we can meet the targets for timber that we had sort of promised.
2:52:32
But you were concerned that those couldn’t be met.
2:52:34
Well, I wasn’t sure.
2:52:36
I was pretty much dependent upon the timber planners and so forth, the
2:52:42
silviculturists that were in the room.
2:52:46
But in terms of how the plan has worked out, it certainly has not
2:52:51
worked out in terms of producing the wood volume like we thought.
2:52:56
It certainly has not worked out in terms of protecting the spotted owl.
2:53:00
And that’s because of the barred owl, as much as anything?
2:53:05
And it’s because of the barred owl.
2:53:07
If it weren’t for the barred owl, spotted owls would be doing fine, I think.
2:53:11
If I recall right, in the first few years of the monitoring program, it
2:53:14
basically showed a continued slight decline in spotted owl population,
2:53:20
but that was actually predicted.
2:53:21
Correct?
2:53:21
Yeah.
2:53:23
And then, the barred owl started to show up in numbers.
2:53:26
Right?
2:53:26
Well, the
2:53:29
barred owls actually showed up quite a while back.
2:53:32
I mean, they showed up here in Oregon up on the Andrews.
2:53:34
There was the first one I ever heard, which is about 1973, I think.
2:53:41
But for many, many years after that, they were very rare.
2:53:44
I mean, we’d once in a while encounter one.
2:53:46
It was only about 1990 that they really started to show up in numbers.
2:53:52
And when I first started here in the Siuslaw in 1990, with our demography
2:53:58
study, there were about maybe six percent of the sites, we had recorded barred owls.
2:54:03
We’re
2:54:05
up to damned near 100 percent of them now.
2:54:07
There are just barred owls everywhere.
2:54:12
When we were doing all these plans, ISC, FEMAT, those of us in the room
2:54:18
who were biologists that knew about spotted owls and barred owls, kind of
2:54:25
just put our blinders on like this and said, “Well, we’re just going to focus
2:54:28
on spotted owls, we’re not going to really talk too much about barred owls,
2:54:30
because we don’t know what’s going to happen.” You know, that’s kind of—
2:54:34
This is in the early ‘90s?
2:54:34
That’s kind of what I did.
2:54:38
You know, I just felt like if I start thinking about barred owls
2:54:42
and what may happen long-term, I
2:54:46
don’t think anything’s going to work.
2:54:50
So, I put the blinders on and just said, “Well, I’m going to do the best job I can
2:54:54
at managing habitat, and we’ll kind of see where the barred owl thing goes.” Right
2:54:58
then, I just didn’t feel like we could say for sure because there were so few of
2:55:02
them around. But, we were worried. If you look at the papers that I published back
2:55:06
in, like the report we did up in British Columbia in 1987, I think it was the year
2:55:12
I went to work for the Forest Service, we said, hey, this doesn’t bode well.
2:55:17
We basically said, there are more barred owls now in British Columbia than
2:55:20
spotted owls, and it’s not looking good.
2:55:24
Is that basically the pathway, where they came down, was from the north?
2:55:27
They kind of came from the east and north.
2:55:30
They came over through Montana, Idaho, kind of west, and from Canada
2:55:35
down through the Cascades, mainly.
2:55:39
Is there any reason for the population movement other than just
2:55:43
the long-term dynamics of animal population movement and migrations?
2:55:48
We don’t know what caused the range expansion.
2:55:50
Somehow, they got across the Great Plains.
2:55:53
Kent Livesay
2:55:57
wrote a paper that summarized what we know about the history
2:55:59
of the movements of barred owls.
2:56:01
And there were these sorts of historic locations scattered out there in some
2:56:06
weird places in Colorado and west of Colorado in the 1800’s or 1900’s, and
2:56:12
then they showed up in Montana in about 1920, and B.C. in about 1940 or so.
2:56:20
So, we’re not sure exactly how they got across.
2:56:23
All we know is that, somehow they got through.
2:56:25
And once they hit the forest of the West Coast; they’re a
2:56:27
forest owl, they just exploded.
2:56:30
They just kept coming west and south, and they’re all the way
2:56:34
down into southern California now.
2:56:36
So,
2:56:39
they’re kind of like the red-tailed hawk of the owl world, they’re incredibly
2:56:47
resilient and very much a generalist.
2:56:50
They’re bigger than spotted owls.
2:56:52
They’re very territorial.
2:56:53
They have small home ranges.
2:56:57
As a result, this plan that we thought was going to protect spotted owls, is
2:57:01
not working well at all for spotted owls.
2:57:04
In fact, in most study areas, they’re going extinct, and the
2:57:08
rate of change has accelerated.
2:57:10
In
2:57:13
the ‘90s, as you said, the rate of change was relatively
2:57:16
gradual, from what we can tell.
2:57:18
But that was expected for other reasons.
2:57:22
It was.
2:57:23
It was almost like a lag effect.
2:57:24
Yeah, we kind of thought--
2:57:25
Of the timber harvest dynamic and the implementation of the reserves, there’d
2:57:28
be a lag effect of five or ten years.
2:57:30
Right?
2:57:31
Right, that’s what we assumed.
2:57:32
We actually assumed it would be longer than that, that there would be like
2:57:35
a fifty-year lag effect, as these stands recover in the reserves, and
2:57:40
spotted owls would gradually recover.
2:57:43
The population decline would sort of level off and remain
2:57:46
stable, or even increase a little
2:57:50
bit.
2:57:50
So, we weren’t surprised in those early years by the continued decline.
2:57:55
But what has been pretty remarkable in the last ten to fifteen years,
2:58:01
is on many of our study areas, the decline has accelerated.
2:58:06
On the Olympic Peninsula, in Cle Elum, or other study areas in
2:58:09
Washington, they’re about all gone.
2:58:12
They went from being fairly common species with lots of reproduction,
2:58:18
lots of good years, to very rare and almost no reproduction.
2:58:25
That’s what we’re seeing on those study areas now.
2:58:27
They try to reproduce and they fail, probably because they’re competing
2:58:31
with barred owls for food and they’re getting harassed by the barred owls.
2:58:36
So, what we’re seeing is, I think, the extinction.
2:58:39
We’re headed that direction.
2:58:40
And I think there’s nothing we can do, Northwest Forest Plan
2:58:45
or otherwise shooting barred owls, is going to stop that.
2:58:47
I think we’re stuck with barred owls 100 years from now being the
2:58:52
only large Strix owl in this region.
2:58:56
I think spotted owls are gonna go.
2:58:58
It’s a dismal thought, but that, based on the data, that’s about all I can conclude.
2:59:05
It’s kind of humbling to think about; for all the work and passion and
2:59:10
good intentions that went into this, that “mother nature” had other ideas?
2:59:14
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.
2:59:16
I mean, is that a fair way to assess it?
2:59:17
Yeah.
2:59:18
If you had asked me when I was 25-years-old, 30-years-old, a young
2:59:23
biologist working on spotted owls, if you develop a good habitat management plan
2:59:28
for spotted owls, would they do fine?
2:59:29
I would have said, “Sure, no problem.” But as I’ve gotten older, and you
2:59:36
see things like this going on, you begin to realize that nothing in
2:59:41
nature stays the same. It’s constantly changing, and these sorts of species
2:59:47
interactions have gone on for hundreds of millions of years, if not longer.
2:59:54
And that 99.9 percent of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct
3:00:00
because of competition with other species.
3:00:04
You begin to realize that this kind of thing is common place, we just
3:00:08
happen to be watching in this case, and measuring something when it happened.
3:00:12
And that in itself is a valuable lesson.
3:00:14
Oh, yeah.
3:00:15
Even though it may be painful to watch because of the passion you
3:00:19
have for a particular species.
3:00:19
Oh, it’s incredibly humbling.
3:00:22
But it’s still a humbling and an honest lesson to learn, wouldn’t you say?
3:00:25
Oh, yeah, yeah.
3:00:31
From my perspective and short span of one human life, it’s incredibly sad
3:00:39
to have seen this happen, but at the same time, I get through the day by telling
3:00:45
myself, “Hey, this was just one case where we were watching when one species
3:00:55
started to interact with another in a competitive sort of interaction, and one
3:01:01
species, I think, is going to go extinct.” Now, I would make that statement in terms
3:01:08
of the Northwest, the northern spotted owl, and probably the California spotted
3:01:15
owl, at least in the foreseeable future.
3:01:16
I don’t expect to see that happen with the Mexican spotted owl because the Mexican
3:01:20
spotted owl occurs in those really dry canyon lands in the Southwest where barred
3:01:25
owls don’t do well, as far as we can tell.
3:01:30
Barred owls simply are very much a species of the mesic northern forest.
3:01:36
And to date, anyway, have not been able to make inroads into that southwestern
3:01:41
population of the spotted owl.
3:01:43
So,
3:01:46
again, at least for the short-term, I think that subspecies is probably
3:01:53
secure, but this one up here, I just don’t find much reason for hope.
3:02:01
I think the Fish and Wildlife Service can shoot barred owls until they’re
3:02:03
blue in the face, and it’s not going to in the long run change a damn thing.
3:02:07
Don’t you find that morally problematic?
3:02:08
[Shooting barred owls]
3:02:08
Oh, yeah, I do.
3:02:10
That’s one reason I retired.
3:02:11
I didn’t want to deal with it.
3:02:12
I did not want to be
3:02:13
-- Because, just like sea lions being shot by dams [to help fish runs] , I mean, I
3:02:18
find that morally reprehensible myself.
3:02:20
Yeah.
3:02:21
That’s an opinion, for the record, but I find that troubling.
3:02:25
Yeah, well, at least with the dams, short-term, I think if they shoot
3:02:29
those sea lions, they can probably get some fish going up the river.
3:02:31
But here, with an owl that runs around in the middle of night in
3:02:36
the middle of forest, it’s hopeless.
3:02:37
I mean, you just can’t do it, even if you wanted to.
3:02:42
I mean, it goes back to the whole pejorative term, the “God Squad”
3:02:45
at the BLM people [and U.S. Fish and Wildlife] playing god?
3:02:47
Yeah.
3:02:48
That was one of the main reasons I retired, because right before I
3:02:52
retired, they were starting to implement these barred owl removal studies,
3:02:56
and I just didn’t want to do it.
3:02:58
And I told people that.
3:02:59
I told the media.
3:03:00
I told anybody who would listen to me.
3:03:01
I just don’t believe this will work.
3:03:06
I think it is a study you’ll learn something in terms of cause-and-effect
3:03:12
of competition between species, but in terms of a long-term solution to
3:03:16
our problem, it’s not going to be.
3:03:18
So, it’s just sort of like learning for the sake of learning
3:03:22
without out, you know, really
3:03:24
-- And you’re also killing a beautiful creature.
3:03:26
You’re killing a bunch of animals and it’s not going to do you any good.
3:03:31
Anyway, let’s go back to something more positive.
3:03:33
The NSO monitoring program in the wake of the FEMAT report, the Record of
3:03:42
Decision, Standards and Guidelines, how was the monitoring program set up?
3:03:48
There were certain key components, and do you want to just describe how that came
3:03:52
about, and the objectives and the methods and the models that you were using?
3:03:56
Okay.
3:03:57
Well, the monitoring program actually kind of got started, the
3:04:02
studies themselves actually started before we had a monitoring program.
3:04:06
The first one was started down in California by Franklin and Rocky
3:04:13
Gutierrez, and that was started in 1985.
3:04:18
Oh, so the one that produced, or at least came out of this work
3:04:22
here, that we see in this [book on spotted owls being viewed] , correct?
3:04:23
Yeah, yeah.
3:04:24
Okay, 1985.
3:04:27
The same year, I started banding birds down on Roseburg BLM.
3:04:32
Joe Lint wanted me to start down there, so I went down and started
3:04:35
banding a few birds on Roseburg BLM.
3:04:37
So, those two studies started in 1985.
3:04:42
Shortly thereafter, once we got the ISC plan, we decided we needed to
3:04:49
start doing something more quantitative than just having these two studies
3:04:54
in these two widely-based areas.
3:04:57
Actually, it was even prior to that, when
3:05:03
the old-growth program got started at PNW up in Olympia
3:05:07
with Len Ruggiero and those guys.
3:05:11
I got hired, and we started then doing some marking studies
3:05:15
up on the Olympic Peninsula.
3:05:18
We started another one over on Cle Elum over on the east side, in 1990.
3:05:24
The H.J. Andrews got started in ’87.
3:05:27
But it wasn’t until, I’m trying to think of when we officially, it was
3:05:30
when Joe Lint wrote that monitoring
3:05:35
manuscript.
3:05:36
I have it here.
3:05:38
I forget what year
3:05:42
it was.
3:05:42
So, Eric’s looking at the 1999 Forest Service monitoring plan
3:05:50
in which the primary author is Joseph Lint, and there were,
3:05:52
what, et al., seven others?
3:05:53
Yeah, Barry Noon, Bob Anthony, me, Marty [Raphael] , the usual
3:05:57
cast of characters was in there.
3:06:03
So, we started all these studies at different times between 1985
3:06:07
and I think the last ones got started about 1990 or so, so over
3:06:14
about a five or six-year time span.
3:06:16
We started all these studies, but we never really had a formal overarching
3:06:21
document that pulled all that together and said this is our monitoring plan.
3:06:26
We just sort of started all these studies because we had the money to do them.
3:06:30
The study areas were never picked randomly, we just we got a little
3:06:35
money here, and we started one there, we got a little money someplace
3:06:38
else, we started another one.
3:06:38
So, that we got all these studies going, all these mark and recapture
3:06:42
studies, and then we began to realize, hey, we need a formal protocol so
3:06:47
we do the same thing on every one of these areas, so they’re all comparable.
3:06:51
And that’s what precipitated this document here.
3:06:53
And that happened after the forest plan was created, because you kind of
3:06:57
realized, for legal and political and economic reasons, you needed to have
3:07:02
something that said, okay, well, here’s what we’re spending our time and money on.
3:07:06
Correct?
3:07:06
Right, yeah.
3:07:07
We needed a formal document that sort of laid out how we were going to be
3:07:12
doing the surveys, so that we were doing them, conducting them the same way, so
3:07:14
that we could actually bring all the data together and do a meta-analyses and
3:07:19
actually draw some conclusions out of it.
3:07:23
So, basically that was what this, the Lint, et.
3:07:26
al. paper, was.
3:07:28
We had a number of other sort of informal protocols, one of which I wrote up that
3:07:32
we tried to follow in all the study areas, in terms of when you check the
3:07:36
birds, and how many mice you used to locate the nest tree, and all that
3:07:40
kind of stuff; all these protocols.
3:07:43
And
3:07:45
the basis was population and demography, mainly?
3:07:48
Yes.
3:07:49
How many and what was the range?
3:07:52
Those were the main two factors, correct?
3:07:54
We were worried about having big enough samples to actually draw conclusions
3:07:58
about population trends on each study area, and we were worried about having
3:08:02
the study areas be representative of the whole range of the owl.
3:08:07
The sample size thing was relatively straight-forward.
3:08:10
We tried to shoot for at least forty birds on each study area; in most
3:08:13
cases there were a lot more than that.
3:08:15
But the representative part was a bit more of a problem because, obviously, none
3:08:21
of them are on non-federal land, so we don’t really have any data from private
3:08:25
lands, or at least they weren’t initially.
3:08:29
And they weren’t randomly selected.
3:08:31
It would have been hopeless trying to pick a random study area
3:08:33
because of land ownership problems.
3:08:37
But, from the very beginning, we argued that, well, yeah, they’re not randomly
3:08:40
selected, but they are so big and there are so many of them distributed across
3:08:44
the Pacific Northwest, they cover something like nine percent of the range
3:08:48
of the spotted owl that we believed.
3:08:50
Wasn’t there like ten or twelve areas, main areas?
3:08:54
It’s varied over time.
3:08:56
There are eight on federal lands.
3:08:58
Oh, okay.
3:08:58
But there have been a number of others that have kind of come and gone over
3:09:02
the years, and they were included in some analyses, but they’ve dropped out.
3:09:06
For example, there was one conducted by NCASI over on the east slope
3:09:10
of the Cascades in Washington.
3:09:11
That study area is now gone.
3:09:14
They didn’t get enough funding to keep it going.
3:09:16
There was another one down at the Point Reyes bird observatory, they did that
3:09:20
one for a few years, and it’s now gone.
3:09:24
So, in
3:09:27
the last meta-analysis, I think was eleven study areas in total.
3:09:31
A couple of them are on non-federal lands, so now we do have some data from
3:09:36
non-federal lands, one on the Hoopa Reservation in California, and one
3:09:40
on Green Diamond property in northern California is entirely on private land.
3:09:48
So, we do have some data from federal lands.
3:09:51
In some of the meta-analyses that we conducted early on, we analyzed
3:09:55
the sample separately to see if there were differences between
3:09:59
federal and non-federal lands.
3:10:01
In the most recent analysis that we published a year or so ago, we concluded
3:10:05
that we’ve done these comparisons, and we don’t really see much difference in what’s
3:10:09
going on in the federal and non-federal, so now we’re just going to combine them.
3:10:13
So, in the last analysis, we had eleven study areas so which
3:10:16
we analyzed as one, big sample.
3:10:20
Now, one of them is the Central Cascades in Oregon, too,
3:10:23
centered on the Andrews, correct?
3:10:24
The H.J. Andrews, yeah.
3:10:25
It’s called the Andrews, but it’s somewhat analogous to the, it’s close to the
3:10:30
AMA that’s in that area, too, isn’t it?
3:10:32
Or it is included in that?
3:10:32
Right?
3:10:32
Yeah, the center of the study area is the H.J. Andrews, but there are all these
3:10:37
peripheral sites around the Andrews, down south, Cougar Reservoir and all that
3:10:43
area, up into the French Pete Wilderness, and a bunch of sites peripheral to the
3:10:48
Andrews, that are part of that sample.
3:10:50
And of course, the demography and the population decline there is pretty
3:10:56
much similar to everywhere else that you’re seeing in the Cascades?
3:10:59
It’s similar to,
3:11:05
without having the last report in front of me, I can’t tell you exactly.
3:11:08
It’s certainly doing better than the study areas in Washington.
3:11:13
It’s doing better than the study area over here in the Coast Range, but it’s
3:11:18
still declining pretty dramatically.
3:11:21
And there are barred owls everywhere on the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest.
3:11:25
So, they’re facing the same competitive issues up there that they are in
3:11:31
the Coast Range, it’s just that there are fewer barred owls, but
3:11:34
there are still a lot of them.
3:11:35
So, the Coast Range, you can’t turn around without running into a barred
3:11:39
owl any more, they’re just everywhere.
3:11:44
But, overall, the areas that are doing best tend to be the areas
3:11:49
in the southern part of the range, the southern Cascades study area
3:11:52
down around Ashland, in that area.
3:11:55
Roseburg BLM is doing a little better than other study areas.
3:11:59
[phone rings]
3:11:59
[Break in Audio]
3:12:01
Continuing talking about central Arizona—excuse me, the areas that are
3:12:07
doing the best, in southern Oregon?
3:12:09
Yeah, southern Oregon is doing well, and the southern Cascades area, but
3:12:14
some of the study areas in California,
3:12:18
until they started doing removals down there like on the Green Diamond
3:12:22
study area, that population was declining pretty rapidly, too.
3:12:27
It just looks like barred owls really thrive in those coastal, very wet types of
3:12:34
coniferous forest, which is what you have.
3:12:36
Like Green Diamond is right along the coast of northern California.
3:12:40
And
3:12:43
the same thing is true of the Hoopa Tribe just south of
3:12:45
there, on the Hoopa Reservation.
3:12:47
Barred owls have just really exploded there and done well.
3:12:50
And so, those populations [spotted owl] have been declining pretty rapidly, too.
3:12:54
Until they started shooting barred owls, and then, they’ve kind of rebounded a bit.
3:12:57
But I haven’t paid much attention to them.
3:13:00
How many owls have been shot?
3:13:02
I mean, are you talking about thousands?
3:13:03
Not yet, but that’s where we’re headed.
3:13:06
This year, I haven’t talked to Dave Wiens, but I think they’ve shot close to 400
3:13:11
barred owls maybe, something like that.
3:13:16
So, what are the most important scientific points that have been made or that came
3:13:23
out of the monitoring programs since the Northwest Forest Plan, or you can
3:13:26
even continue back to the beginning?
3:13:30
Well, basically what’s coming out of the monitoring plan, is we have a
3:13:33
long-term data set that pretty well lays out population trends of spotted
3:13:40
owls, basically since about 1987 or ’90.
3:13:46
So, for the last 26 years, we’ve got pretty good data on population trends.
3:13:56
The analysis shows that during that period, the population pretty much
3:14:00
range-wide, has declined, continued to decline, and in some areas very
3:14:05
dramatically, and in other areas less so.
3:14:07
For a few years in the ‘90s, it looked like some of the populations
3:14:12
farther south like at Roseburg BLM, in that area, were close to stable
3:14:17
or only declining a tiny little bit.
3:14:21
But in the last meta-analysis, not every one of the areas, but virtually all the
3:14:26
areas, we’re seeing continued declines, and in the study areas in the northern
3:14:32
part of the range, the declines are on the order of six, seven percent per year, and
3:14:41
that’s just not a sustainable population.
3:14:44
That’s going downhill fast.
3:14:48
For example, the Cle Elum study area on the east slope
3:14:51
of the Cascades in Washington.
3:14:53
When we started that study in 1990, we had probably eighty-some pairs
3:14:58
of spotted owls on that study area.
3:15:00
And this last couple years, we’ve had like four or five.
3:15:07
So, we’ve gone—
3:15:08
A precipitous drop.
3:15:09
Oh, yeah.
3:15:10
We’ve gone nearly to extinction, which has been incredibly
3:15:14
difficult on the field crews.
3:15:17
On these study areas, we’ve been able to keep these studies going because
3:15:22
we’ve got some very dedicated people who have spent virtually their entire
3:15:26
adult lives doing these studies.
3:15:32
Stan Sovereign over on the Cle Elum study area, and Margie Taylor over
3:15:35
there, they started that study in 1990.
3:15:37
Stan’s still working on it.
3:15:40
But for them to go out there every year and just watch their owls that they
3:15:45
get incredibly attached to, you know, twenty years old or more, disappear
3:15:51
one-by-one and not get replaced.
3:15:55
Well, they are being replaced by barred owls.
3:15:57
They’re being replaced with barred owls, but it’s psychologically, it’s incredibly
3:16:02
difficult to do that kind of work.
3:16:08
What about what we’ve learned about other endangered species, or species in general
3:16:13
within the Northwest Forest Plan area?
3:16:15
I’ve interviewed Marty and we’ve talked about the murrelet, but he also crossed
3:16:18
over and gave his opinion on other things.
3:16:21
Do you want to give your take on, just your general take on biodiversity habitat
3:16:26
health in general, regarding the plan and its implementation, now 20 years into it?
3:16:31
Like I said earlier, I think this plan has done a pretty good job of
3:16:36
protecting habitat for late seral, for old-growth species, other than a few
3:16:41
examples, notably like the spotted owl.
3:16:44
I think in terms of things like flying squirrels and red tree
3:16:47
voles and white-footed voles, and I don’t know much about murrelets.
3:16:54
But certainly a lot of these terrestrial species I think are
3:16:58
doing fairly well on federal lands.
3:17:01
Certainly, the fire [issue] is a concern, and there are some issues that
3:17:06
in the long run may be problematic.
3:17:08
But, at least to date, I think we have done about as good a job as we’re ever
3:17:14
going to do at protecting old forests,
3:17:18
and thereby, protecting the kinds of species that occur in those old forests.
3:17:23
The trick from here on out though, is going to be continuing to do, protect
3:17:29
those kinds of forest, while at the same time dealing with fire and climate
3:17:35
change, and I think we’re kidding ourselves if we think we can make things
3:17:44
stay the same as they were historically, because the forests are going to change.
3:17:48
I mean, when climate changes, we’ll be dealing with different species
3:17:52
compositions and altitudinal changes.
3:17:56
Well, especially, as the climate changes.
3:17:58
That seems to be the big elephant in the room.
3:18:02
Right, right.
3:18:03
I mean, across the whole planet.
3:18:06
So,
3:18:09
okay,
3:18:12
how much work have you done with Native American communities?
3:18:16
Essentially zero.
3:18:18
And why is that?
3:18:20
Mainly because they never expressed any interest in what I do.
3:18:25
You know, I certainly never tried to act as an ambassador to Native
3:18:32
American communities, because I’ve never done that with anyone.
3:18:37
I’ve given lots of talks to environmental groups, but I’ve always usually done
3:18:42
that when somebody comes to me and says, “Hey, will you come talk to our group.”
3:18:47
Will you come talk to our Audubon chapter or will you come talk to our Society of
3:18:52
American Foresters meeting in Portland next month? So, and I’ve never had any
3:19:00
Native Americans do that to me, come to me and say, “Hey, I’m interested
3:19:03
in what you’re doing. I want to hear.”
3:19:06
But in terms of the plan in general, because Native American interests
3:19:09
were involved in lands, there wasn’t a lot of cross-over with your work?
3:19:13
No, no.
3:19:16
Which is frustrating, because
3:19:20
in all the years I’ve done this kind of work, we’ve had one Native American person
3:19:30
on our crew, and he was a super-neat dude.
3:19:34
He came and worked on our spotted owl crew here in the Siuslaw for a year.
3:19:38
What tribe was he from?
3:19:39
I don’t even remember.
3:19:41
But he was interested in biology as a science.
3:19:47
He went to college and got a degree in teaching, and he’s teaching, I think,
3:19:51
high school biology, down in California.
3:19:55
But that is incredibly rare.
3:19:59
And I often talk about this, again, in these discussions, and
3:20:04
I think there’s just a fundamental
3:20:09
disconnect between how scientists tend to look at the world, and how
3:20:14
Native Americans look at the world.
3:20:17
Those two things just don’t jive.
3:20:24
I think Native Americans look at scientists, this is my gut feeling, I
3:20:29
haven’t talked to any Native Americans about this, but just my gut feeling is
3:20:34
that they look at my way of looking at the world through data and rational sorts
3:20:42
of experiments and reasoning, as not the correct way to look at the world.
3:20:49
It’s just, you know, more of a religious sort of world-view.
3:20:57
It’s a much more pantheistic, interconnected view, and scientists by
3:21:02
definition have to atomize the world.
3:21:04
We take everything apart in little pieces, right.
3:21:06
You have to, and that is contrary to a holistic, pantheistic,
3:21:11
interconnected view of the world.
3:21:12
Yeah, it’s too bad, because I think we’re on the same side, you know?
3:21:17
At least, to some extent.
3:21:18
I also think maybe we’re not when it comes to timber harvest
3:21:21
in the Coast Range of Oregon.
3:21:24
But
3:21:26
I think fundamentally, we share the same concerns about
3:21:32
the health of our environment, whereas I think the Donald Trumps
3:21:36
of the world could give a shit.
3:21:38
But I think most scientists, we tend to be really concerned about the long-term
3:21:45
survival of our species and the landscapes we live in, and I think Native Americans
3:21:50
are concerned about the same things.
3:21:52
But I think a lot of city dwellers and the Donald Trumps of the
3:21:57
world are so disconnected, and they simply don’t give a shit.
3:22:04
What do you feel changed regarding the collaborative dynamic between federal,
3:22:12
even state agencies, but focusing on federal agencies during this whole process
3:22:18
over the Endangered Species Act, the spotted owl and other species, kind of
3:22:23
forced at least the Forest Service and the BLM to be more intensely collaborative
3:22:28
than they had been in the past.
3:22:32
Would you agree with that assessment, and how did you see that manifest
3:22:35
itself, and has it continued?
3:22:37
Yeah, it certainly did force the agencies to work together.
3:22:44
And I think there was a fairly narrow window [break in audio]--
3:22:47
[End of Part 1, Start of Part 2]
3:22:48
When that sort of change and that sort of collaboration was possible.
3:22:55
And like I said earlier
3:22:57
-- What happened?
3:22:59
Oh, no,
3:23:02
it’s on File 80 now.
3:23:05
Sorry, for the recording, I had to double-check that I
3:23:07
didn’t do something stupid.
3:23:08
So, we’re back on.
3:23:10
So, I think there was, from sometime in the late 1960’s until about the
3:23:19
time of the Northwest Forest Plan, about 1994 or so, I think there was
3:23:25
a fairly brief window there when the stars were in alignment when there were
3:23:33
a number of new laws like NFMA and the [National] Environmental Protection Act
3:23:39
[NEPA] , that for the first time caused the agencies to be concerned about
3:23:51
ecosystem health, trying to protect endangered species and that sort of thing.
3:23:56
I think that there was also a very dramatic increase in environmental
3:24:04
groups in terms of their interaction with federal agencies and
3:24:08
getting involved in the process.
3:24:09
I think there was sort of a progressive attitude in the Congress
3:24:14
in terms of people thinking that
3:24:19
we can make changes.
3:24:20
We can do a good job of managing our environment.
3:24:24
I think there were a lot of people thinking along those lines,
3:24:30
including our representatives.
3:24:31
They may not have been too enthusiastic about the effects on jobs, but
3:24:36
they at least were open to talking about things we could do to do a
3:24:41
better job of being good stewards.
3:24:43
And I think that’s what resulted in a lot of changes that took place
3:24:49
during that fairly short time period.
3:24:52
I think as that happened, and it became apparent to some of these agencies
3:24:56
that this was going to be a pretty big change in terms of how they did
3:25:00
business, and that it was going to have a big effect on jobs in the agencies,
3:25:06
and in local communities, some of those agencies kind of retrenched and became
3:25:13
much less open to continuing that sort of collaboration and those sorts of changes.
3:25:21
I think that’s particular true of BLM.
3:25:24
I think the Forest Service just kind of gave up and said, “Okay,
3:25:30
we’ll do whatever.
3:25:32
Just tell us what we need to do and we’ll go for it.” The BLM has kind of
3:25:37
dug in their heels, and now, through their district plans, they are basically
3:25:45
rewriting the whole book, saying that we’re no longer going to necessarily
3:25:50
follow the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:25:51
We’re going to do our individual plans and we’ll figure out
3:25:54
where we end up down the road.
3:25:56
And to a lesser extent, the Forest Service is doing that, too,
3:25:58
with their new planning process.
3:25:59
But,
3:26:02
so I think it’s now
3:26:05
changed and the two agencies are sort of going their separate ways now.
3:26:09
Again, like before.
3:26:10
Again, where they were, right before.
3:26:15
I keep waiting for a lawsuit where someone says, hey, if you are not
3:26:21
going to follow the Northwest Forest Plan, this sort of inter-agency plan,
3:26:26
and you’re going to all start doing these different things, then that’s in
3:26:30
violation of the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:26:33
We haven’t seen that, but I do kind of wonder if we’re not going
3:26:38
to end up there at some point.
3:26:40
Do you think there’s any danger of this thing becoming completely disassembled?
3:26:47
Because it was essentially an executive action, more or less.
3:26:49
Yeah, I don’t know.
3:26:51
I suppose it’s possible.
3:26:54
But even if that happens, I’ll be amazed if we saw a backtracking to
3:27:04
where we were in the 1970s or ‘80s.
3:27:06
I just don’t think that would be socially likely to happen.
3:27:10
I think, if they were to say, we’re going to go back to business as
3:27:14
usual and cutting seven billion board-feet a year or whatever it was,
3:27:20
that, legally, that would be a problem.
3:27:21
I think there would be so many lawsuits flying.
3:27:24
Plus, the people would start living in trees again.
3:27:26
[Protest to stop logging.]
3:27:27
Well, yeah.
3:27:27
And more than they did before.
3:27:29
Yeah, probably.
3:27:31
So, I don’t see a complete reversal.
3:27:34
I wouldn’t be surprised, I don’t think, considering the current political
3:27:38
situation in Washington, D.C., backtracking, or at least trying to do
3:27:47
more cutting on national forests and BLM districts.
3:27:49
That wouldn’t
3:27:52
surprise me.
3:27:53
But I don’t think that, at least not in my lifetime, I’d be amazed if we go.
3:27:58
If you were going to talk, I’m obviously not a timber guy,
3:28:01
but let’s say it was a panel.
3:28:03
If you were going to talk to traditional timber communities that
3:28:08
have either died off or struggle to survive today, what would you tell
3:28:14
them about what was intended and what didn’t go according to plan?
3:28:21
Boy.
3:28:22
Well, the intent was always to try to maintain a healthy environment, not
3:28:31
just for humans, but for those species that we share this environment with.
3:28:37
That at least from my perspective, that was kind of the driving
3:28:41
force behind my involvement.
3:28:45
I always felt like humans have got no end of spokespersons in terms
3:28:50
of what their wants and desires and needs are, the animals that live
3:28:54
out there don’t have many at all.
3:28:57
And that my role was to try to be a rational spokesperson for those
3:29:04
voiceless organisms that I think are just as important as humans in
3:29:08
terms of the grand scheme of things.
3:29:10
We tend to think that we’re the most important species on the planet,
3:29:13
but we’re no more important than a freaking rotifer as far as I’m
3:29:17
concerned, in terms of the big picture.
3:29:20
In fact, we may be less important, if we nuke ourselves and the
3:29:23
rotifer ends up surviving.
3:29:33
I’m kind of getting off the point.
3:29:38
So, my hope was that by developing these plans, we could make sure that these
3:29:45
species that we all care about had a place to live and survive, but that
3:29:51
we humans also had a place to live and survive, and work and make a living.
3:29:59
And I knew from the beginning that something had to give.
3:30:01
There’s no way we can all have everything we want without giving, you know,
3:30:07
something to somebody or something else.
3:30:10
And that’s the painful part of this.
3:30:16
If you only think about humans,
3:30:22
even then, I think you end up screwing up in the end.
3:30:25
Because, if all you think about is humans, you’re going to end up
3:30:27
in a place that’s pretty boring to live and probably pretty unhealthy.
3:30:31
Not sustainable.
3:30:32
Yeah, if you don’t worry about air quality and you don’t worry about the lichens
3:30:36
and the mosses, and you don’t worry about the mice and the voles and the salmon,
3:30:43
we’re all part of that system and you need to worry about those things.
3:30:49
The unfortunate thing is
3:30:54
the human population can’t keep growing indefinitely and have
3:31:00
this all work out in the end, because we overwhelm our resources.
3:31:04
That’s kind of the
3:31:09
way I look at
3:31:12
it.
3:31:12
I recognize that in trying to manage for these other species, we definitely have,
3:31:19
in the short-term, reduced the number of jobs that might be available to somebody
3:31:22
living in a rural community, but in the long-term, I hope that I’m making the
3:31:28
place healthier for their grandkids, or
3:31:33
ten generations down the road.
3:31:35
So, that’s kind of how I justify the short-term pain that I
3:31:41
know these decisions cause.
3:31:46
Kind of capstone questions, a couple, and then we’ll finish up here.
3:31:49
What do you think is the most important reason for having gone through this
3:31:53
whole process of planning, creating and implementing the Northwest Forest Plan?
3:31:58
The most important reasons for doing it?
3:32:01
Yeah.
3:32:01
Well, to me, the most important reason was what I just talked about.
3:32:04
Basically, it’s to try to preserve the long-term health of the environment in
3:32:12
which we live, thereby, improving the long-term likelihood that humans are going
3:32:18
to be able to persist in that environment.
3:32:20
That, to me, is why I’ve done what I’ve done.
3:32:24
I
3:32:26
also think that
3:32:31
just in addition to our being able to survive in these environments, I think
3:32:35
in terms of sort of a philosophical
3:32:41
view that humans, I think if we lived in an environment where all we had
3:32:47
was other humans and a few crops that we grew or beef cows that we
3:32:53
lived on, if we lose that species diversity, is important, I think.
3:33:01
That we draw, maybe some more than others, that we draw pleasure and
3:33:08
sustenance from being able to interact with an environment we find interesting
3:33:14
and visually stimulating and pleasing.
3:33:20
A world without spotted owls and tree voles and flying squirrels
3:33:23
would be a pretty boring place.
3:33:27
And for that reason, I think it’s important that we try to preserve
3:33:32
biodiversity as much as we can, and not willy-nilly wipe out millions
3:33:39
of years of evolution in just [snaps fingers ] the blink of an eye, which
3:33:42
we’re doing all over the damn globe.
3:33:45
So, those are the arguments that I find
3:33:52
rational in terms of doing things like the Northwest Forest Plan or
3:33:56
any other environmental sorts of restrictions we put on ourselves to try
3:34:02
to avoid destroying our environment.
3:34:06
How do you feel the Northwest Forest Plan and the whole process has affected
3:34:09
forest and natural resource planning in the U.S., but also abroad in terms of
3:34:15
people watching what happened here, and I know you have colleagues elsewhere.
3:34:19
They’ve watched, and I’m sure you’ve communicated with them, so
3:34:22
how do you feel it’s affected you here, but also in terms of other
3:34:26
countries that have been watching us?
3:34:28
I think it’s had a big influence here across the country, across the
3:34:32
U.S., particularly on federal lands.
3:34:34
I think watching us go through this battle out here in the Northwest, has
3:34:40
influenced management on a lot of the national forests all over the country.
3:34:45
Certainly, not to the extent they’ve thrown everything into big reserves
3:34:48
like we have, but in terms of being more focused on non-game sorts
3:34:53
of issues and just environmental quality issues, things like that.
3:34:58
And I think NFMA had a lot to do with that.
3:35:02
But, even across the globe, certainly, I think we’ve had
3:35:06
a fairly significant impact.
3:35:08
I mean, India, for example, you know, people like Marty [Raphael] and Bruce
3:35:13
[Marcot] and those guys, have made multiple field trips to India to try to
3:35:16
help them with establishing reserves or some kind of management for endangered
3:35:23
species and threatened species there.
3:35:24
And they have a much more intense scarcity dynamic there than we have.
3:35:28
Oh, yeah, it’s horrible.
3:35:30
Australia, they have struggled with management down there, of
3:35:34
their forests and things like powerful owls and things like that.
3:35:39
I went to a conference down there many, many years ago, and they definitely
3:35:43
were watching what was going on up here, trying to implement some kind
3:35:46
of management along those lines to protect non-game kinds of species.
3:35:54
Like you said, I think people from all over the world,
3:35:58
at least in a lot of countries, were paying attention to
3:36:00
what was going on here.
3:36:01
Are there any memorable experiences or stories with any the aspect of your
3:36:06
involvement with the owls or the forest plan that you haven’t talked about yet,
3:36:10
something that maybe is on your mind that, oh, yeah, I didn’t talk about that?
3:36:14
I mean, you probably have gotten more stories than we have time for, but maybe
3:36:19
some nice capstone anecdotes and thoughts?
3:36:23
You should be talking to Jack Ward Thomas.
3:36:25
That’s the kind of stuff he’s good at.
3:36:26
That’s what I heard about Jack, but unfortunately, he’s not here anymore.
3:36:29
I went to Jack’s memorial service about, it’s been four or five
3:36:34
months ago, over in Montana.
3:36:37
One of his grad students got up there, this gal, and just gave a fantastic talk.
3:36:42
She was with Jack the months just before he died, and
3:36:48
interacted with him quite a bit.
3:36:50
She said she went in there one dayh
3:36:54
all flustered about something, having some kind of major problem with
3:37:00
some administrator or something, and was all in a big tizzy.
3:37:04
And Jack’s laying there, he’s on his way out, and he said, “Sis…..you only get
3:37:14
issued six silver bullets and you don’t want to waste ‘em on pissants.” [Laughs]
3:37:23
Did that capture his personality?
3:37:25
Yeah, that captured it, yeah.
3:37:34
Along that line, you’ve already given me some anecdotes about
3:37:36
Jack, but I want to ask you about a couple of the other big players.
3:37:39
Just a paragraph about people that were central to this whole thing.
3:37:45
Jerry Franklin?
3:37:47
Jerry’s definitely been a key player all the way through.
3:37:52
Like I said,
3:37:55
early on, Jerry, he struck me as pretty much a forest ecologist, kind of focusing
3:38:03
on forest succession, things like that.
3:38:06
But eventually, he came around and got interested in old growth, spotted
3:38:09
owls, and long-term preservation.
3:38:11
Once he got into that arena, he had a huge influence.
3:38:17
You know, he’s one of the “gurus,” and people listen to Jerry. He’s a good
3:38:21
speaker and a very strong personality.
3:38:26
And
3:38:29
he has amazed me that he has continued to stay involved.
3:38:32
He’s probably ten years older than I am.
3:38:34
He’s 80.
3:38:35
80, so, shit, he’s eleven years older than me, and he’s still out
3:38:38
there fighting the good fight.
3:38:40
He and Norm, just getting beat up right and left, you know, and keep at it.
3:38:45
He just retired.
3:38:46
Yeah.
3:38:46
I mean, he announced his retirement after next semester.
3:38:48
Yeah, but he’s not going to quit going out there and fighting battles.
3:38:52
You know, he still gets up in the morning when he’s out doing his cone count
3:38:55
stuff, and he still yodels to the trees.
3:38:58
Do you know that?
3:38:59
No, I didn’t know that.
3:39:00
I’ve been told that.
3:39:01
Doesn’t surprise me.
3:39:03
Yeah,
3:39:06
I think he definitely is key, in terms of making people aware of the
3:39:12
unique structure and composition of these forests, and the fact that once
3:39:17
gone, they can never be replaced.
3:39:19
You know, and trying to do something with the agencies to get us out
3:39:23
of this spiral that we’re in,
3:39:28
Jerry and Norm [Johnson] both.
3:39:32
A lot
3:39:35
of us get entrenched on one side or the other of the argument, but those
3:39:39
two guys have tried their darnedest to get, I mean, they recognize the
3:39:44
political issues that we’re dealing with.
3:39:46
And the fact that we’re not getting the cut out, that makes a lot of people
3:39:48
angry, and not supportive of the kinds of things we’re trying to accomplish.
3:39:53
And so, they [Franklin and Johnson] have tried to find some middle of the
3:39:55
road where we could ramp up the cut a bit and keep more jobs, and still
3:40:01
accomplish our environmental objectives.
3:40:05
I don’t always find myself agreeing with exactly what they’re saying,
3:40:07
but I know surely they’re trying.
3:40:11
Nobody else is, at least not many people are except the politicians, and they
3:40:16
just want a black-and-white solution.
3:40:18
And those two guys are trying to come up with some kind of an ecological
3:40:21
compromise that, you know, I don’t know if we’ll ever get there, but
3:40:27
I give them an “A” for effort.
3:40:32
Your compadre on
3:40:35
the other endangered species that was high profile, Marty Raphael.
3:40:40
Talk about Marty a little bit.
3:40:41
Oh, Marty, [laughs] Marty’s great.
3:40:43
You know, he’s your typical Berkeley graduate, kind of
3:40:50
an easy guy to talk to, not argumentative or in your face.
3:40:55
He is a good leader.
3:40:57
He, you know, he helped Jack a lot, like in FEMAT, for
3:41:01
example, get through that effort.
3:41:03
He was kind of second in command under the general [Jack] and ushered
3:41:08
a lot of us through the process.
3:41:09
So, he was kind of the calm presence behind Jack’s big personality?
3:41:12
Exactly, and
3:41:16
he’s been a great boss for me.
3:41:19
He was my boss for most of my career after Len [Ruggiero] left, and just
3:41:24
an incredibly easy guy to work for.
3:41:27
As long as you put in your time and kept publishing papers,
3:41:32
Marty was very supportive.
3:41:33
And I liked the guy.
3:41:37
But
3:41:45
he’s good at dealing with people in that he’s not in your face.
3:41:49
He’s not at all like Jack was.
3:41:51
Jack was a strong personality, but Marty’s very kind of,
3:41:57
you know, he just gets along.
3:41:59
And he was,
3:42:03
at least in my career, very helpful to me in terms of just leaving me alone to
3:42:07
let me do my work, which I appreciated.
3:42:10
How
3:42:12
about Norm Johnson?
3:42:14
Again, he and Jerry have tried their damnedest to find a solution, some
3:42:22
middle-of-the-road solution to managing forests in the Pacific Northwest,
3:42:25
in a way that will meet all our objectives in terms of owls and things
3:42:30
like that, and also provide jobs.
3:42:35
And again, I don’t always find myself agreeing with those
3:42:38
two guys, but they’re trying.
3:42:41
More than anybody else, those two guys have kept banging their heads against
3:42:45
the BLM wall, and to a lesser extent the Forest Service wall, trying to find
3:42:51
a consensus that people will live with.
3:42:55
They get attacked by the environmental groups, they get attacked by industry
3:42:58
groups, you know, the industry groups call them a couple of dummies that
3:43:02
don’t know how to manage trees, and the enviros call them dummies that don’t
3:43:07
know how to manage habitat for owls.
3:43:09
And, yeah, I wouldn’t want to be in their shoes, actually.
3:43:16
They’re committed?
3:43:18
They’re committed.
3:43:19
I think they’ve done a lot of good, just in terms of forcing people to
3:43:23
consider more alternatives than just to either clear-cut or lock-it-up.
3:43:32
I think in the long run, that’s where we’re going to end up no matter whether
3:43:36
we want to be there or not, because all these forests eventually are going
3:43:39
to burn up or blow down or something, or bugs are going to kill them or
3:43:44
something, and you’ve got to be able to manage to produce a new forest.
3:43:50
To do that, you need to consider a fairly broad range of alternatives
3:43:54
other than just turn it into a reserve or turn it into an intensively
3:44:01
managed forty-year rotation.
3:44:04
So, I think they’re sort of in a way ahead of their time.
3:44:10
I think we’re going to end up there eventually, but we still have the
3:44:13
luxury of having these old forests that haven’t burned down, yet
3:44:17
that people don’t want to give up.
3:44:19
How about the aquatic guys, Gordie Reeves and Jim Sedell?
3:44:23
Well.
3:44:23
Jim’s no longer with us, obviously, but just talk about them a little bit?
3:44:26
I mean, you know, on the fish side, those two guys, again,
3:44:32
have had a huge influence.
3:44:34
I mean, they sat up there in the FEMAT exercise and kept telling us we had
3:44:39
to think about fish and how we needed to worry about riparian reserves,
3:44:42
and we needed to worry about wood in the streams, and all those things
3:44:48
that we needed to be thinking about.
3:44:49
So, I think Jim was kind of the guru, but Gordie has continued to stay involved.
3:44:57
He continues to give talks about what he thinks are important things
3:45:02
we should be concerned about.
3:45:04
So, yeah, they’re key.
3:45:08
You can pick almost any of the main
3:45:14
species groups or whatever I can think of, like when we were up there in FEMAT.
3:45:19
We had, I can’t think of the name, but the woman that worked
3:45:24
on lichens and bryophytes.
3:45:27
She kept beating us over the head with, “You need to be thinking about,
3:45:30
you dumb shit vertebrate biologists, need to be worried about lichens and
3:45:35
fungi, because they’re key drivers in the system and they’re important,
3:45:40
even in small patches, and you need to be thinking about those species
3:45:43
and how they’re going to disperse.” It
3:45:47
wasn’t Cameron, it was Robin Lesher. I think was her name. It’s the
3:45:53
people like that made us broaden our horizons a bit and think about
3:45:59
more than just spotted owls as key.
3:46:02
How about Tom Spies, who’s been involved, kind of behind the scenes
3:46:08
more, and now he’s kind of leading the twenty-year review, I believe?
3:46:12
Yeah.
3:46:12
Just tell me about Tom?
3:46:13
Well, Tom’s just, kind of a quiet guy.
3:46:15
Not like Jerry at all, not out there in front of everybody talking
3:46:19
a lot, but very knowledgeable.
3:46:22
He wrote the book on old-growth forests a few years ago.
3:46:25
That’s really a good book.
3:46:26
Old Growth in a New World.
3:46:26
Yeah,
3:46:31
and he was really involved pretty heavily with Jerry early on, and like
3:46:35
that paper that they wrote talking about structure of old forests.
3:46:40
He was a co-author with Jerry on that, I’m pretty sure.
3:46:43
And I think Jerry, he first hired Tom.
3:46:49
Tom came here as a young scientist.
3:46:51
I think Tom was responsible for doing some of the structural kinds
3:46:58
of work that Jerry talks about a lot.
3:47:01
But like Tom actually took some of the old-growth structural data
3:47:05
that I collected back in the ‘80s, and used that, I think, if not in
3:47:10
that book, in some other paper he wrote on structure of old forests.
3:47:16
So, he’s been very involved, very important in terms of FEMAT and
3:47:21
helping us write those sections.
3:47:22
So, how would you rate the whole experience with the Northwest
3:47:29
Forest Plan in terms of your career?
3:47:33
Well,
3:47:39
I’ve kind of gone on since then and gotten more and more sidetracked by
3:47:42
red tree voles and working on again, another single species kind of issue.
3:47:46
And you also worked with other raptors, too, right?
3:47:49
Oh, yeah.
3:47:50
Golden eagles, bald eagles, I’ve done a little of everything.
3:47:53
But in terms of my career, the Northwest Forest Plan was the culmination of
3:48:02
thirty or so years of work in terms of finally reaching sort of a resolution
3:48:09
to the issue in terms of coming up with a plan that applied across
3:48:15
the whole range of the spotted owl.
3:48:19
But again, I just kind of feel like in the long-term, I think it’s sort of
3:48:24
a step along the way that eventually it will get redone, it will change.
3:48:32
My guess is that we’ll go to gradually a more holistic, range-wide approach
3:48:40
that will be less focused on reserves and more focused on trying to deal
3:48:44
with the whole landscape in some sort of a kind of an amorphous, changing
3:48:52
entity, which
3:48:57
for anyone who has been involved up to this time, is incredibly difficult to
3:49:04
think about because of the trust issues.
3:49:07
You know, the idea that the agencies can be trusted to do anything.
3:49:13
And for the old-timers that have fought for all these years
3:49:19
have dealt with all the pushback
3:49:25
from the agencies, no matter which side you’re on, it’s kind of hard to
3:49:30
trust anybody to do something right.
3:49:33
So, I think there’s that concern.
3:49:35
But that’s I think where we’re headed in the long run is some kind
3:49:40
of a more holistic range-wide plan.
3:49:46
But I don’t know.
3:49:49
But in terms of my career, well, particularly after I retired, but even
3:49:54
before I retired, I had gradually, I had gotten so burned out with constantly
3:49:58
fighting over spotted owls, that I looked for something that I could enjoy.
3:50:06
That’s why you got into studying other raptors now, right, more?
3:50:09
Well, it’s certainly why I started working on tree voles.
3:50:13
Oh, tree voles.
3:50:13
I felt like there I was dealing with a species that probably wasn’t going
3:50:16
to go belly-up overnight because of competition with some new species.
3:50:20
And they’re just in terms of an interesting critter to study, they’re
3:50:25
just, yeah, it’s just a little mouse.
3:50:28
Everything eats them, but, god, their
3:50:31
whole life history is just amazing.
3:50:33
I mean, they’re one of the more specialized little voles in the
3:50:37
world, in fact, probably the most in terms of how they live.
3:50:42
So, that’s made it fun again instead of just feeling, oh, shit, you know, one
3:50:47
more time into the battle and so on.
3:50:51
There must have been quite a fatalism that was creeping in as the barred owl thing
3:50:55
became real, and the inevitability of it.
3:50:55
Oh, yeah, it definitely has.
3:51:01
You went from being this idealistic young biologist thinking you could
3:51:05
solve the world’s problems, to being this old fart that, just you’re
3:51:10
pretty pessimistic about your ability to solve those kinds of problems.
3:51:14
So, yeah.
3:51:16
But at least you tried.
3:51:19
Well, yeah, we tried.
3:51:21
With that, we’ll sign off.
3:51:22
Okay.
3:51:23
And I’ll thank you very much for a great interview.
3:51:25
Thank you, Eric.
3:51:25
Yep, thank you.
