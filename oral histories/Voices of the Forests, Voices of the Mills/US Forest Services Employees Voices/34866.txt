00:02
Good morning, this is Dr. Sam Schmieding, Oregon State University,
00:06
also working with U.S. Forest Service on this project, here at the home
00:09
of Al Levno in Corvallis, Oregon.
00:13
Today we are going to do an oral history that is part of the H.J.
00:17
Andrews History Project which includes oral histories as well as archiving
00:23
and archival rescue work, and this is part of the overall preservation
00:28
effort that we're involved in.
00:30
We're going to talk with Al about his 50-year involvement
00:34
with the H.J. Andrews Forest.
00:36
We're going to introduce the interview with a little background information,
00:39
but most of our interview is going to focus on the Andrews and his work there.
00:43
Good morning, Al, how are you?
00:45
I am very good.
00:46
Thank you.
00:47
Excellent.
00:47
I want to thank you for being willing to meet with us.
00:49
This is really going to be, I hope, going to be enjoyable for you.
00:53
I hope so, too.
00:55
So, we will start out with the basic biographical question,
00:58
where were you born and raised?
01:01
That's an interesting question.
01:02
I was born in Rochester, New York.
01:09
My parents have a very kind of interesting history.
01:13
My father lived in a Polish community in Montana, and came there in 1911
01:21
when his family set up a homestead, and he was the oldest of five kids.
01:27
He had his own farm after he was 18 or 19.
01:35
But
01:40
he went to Bozeman for a winter course.
01:42
He'd only finished third grade as his dad took him out of school so
01:46
he could help on the homestead.
01:48
He went to Bozeman and his roommate there decided they should change churches, for
01:56
one Sunday he could go to his church, and one Sunday go to my dad's church.
02:01
So, my dad was a Polish Catholic, but went to a Protestant church.
02:08
And then he came home, sold his farm, everything, went to Rochester, New
02:14
York, finished grade school, high school, college, and then got a
02:18
chance to go to Europe for a master's.
02:22
And while he was there, he met his wife, then the wars and the Depression came.
02:28
He stayed there because his dollars were worth a lot more
02:32
in Poland than they were here.
02:36
So, my grandmother died, was on the death bed, and war was coming, and he decided to
02:48
come home early because my mother couldn't get cleared right away to come over.
02:55
So, she was two or three years getting cleared [visa to U.S.]
02:57
. But in 1938, she made it to
03:05
Rochester, New York, and then I was born the year after in Rochester, New York.
03:06
So, my dad's main interest was to go back to these small communities in Montana
03:13
and be a minister, a Protestant minister.
03:17
And he wanted to federate small Protestant churches to make one strong church.
03:22
What was the exact sect or denomination that was involved?
03:26
He was a Baptist.
03:27
A Baptist?
03:27
Okay.
03:28
But he also worked with Methodists and Presbyterians, and we moved there
03:36
to Montana when I was very young.
03:39
Then we moved all over the state of Montana.
03:42
The first place was
03:46
the Indian reservation right near the Crow Indian Reservation, and we
03:51
tried to adopt an Indian boy there.
03:55
That didn't work out well.
03:56
And then we moved to Eureka, Montana, which is nine miles from the
04:00
Canadian border in a forested region.
04:04
North of Whitefish?
04:05
North of Whitefish, yes.
04:07
Very isolated, as the nearest doctor was 56 miles away.
04:14
But the forest was unbelievable.
04:17
And that's where I decided I was going to be a Forest Service person.
04:22
Really?
04:23
Right there.
04:24
And we chased the deer.
04:30
That was my first actual forestry job when I was in the third grade or fourth grade.
04:39
That area happened to be the Christmas tree capital of the world at that time.
04:43
Oregon is now.
04:44
Oregon is now, yes.
04:46
But that was then because there was a huge burn there in the '30s and the
04:51
trees were just Christmas tree age.
04:54
And they were slow-growing, so they made beautiful Christmas trees.
04:57
Well, they even let us out school so that people could cut Christmas trees.
05:02
And my dad and my mother had a lease on a piece of land with the Forest Service.
05:08
So, we went out and cut Christmas trees by the truckload.
05:12
What forest was that?
05:16
You know, I don't remember.
05:17
Was that the Flathead?
05:19
It could have been Flathead.
05:21
But yeah.
05:22
So that was my introduction to the forest and that was my dream from then on.
05:28
That's what I wanted.
05:29
Did you ever have some interesting experiences up in Glacier Park?
05:33
We did.
05:34
I went to Glacier Park.
05:36
I don't know that it was anything interesting.
05:38
We had lots of interesting experiences in the mountains around Eureka.
05:44
And my dad was, I don't know how, but he was a very good naturalist and he knew the
05:50
names of most of the plants and the trees.
05:55
I picked up an amazing amount from him.
05:58
And then later we moved to another place down in the Bitterroot
06:03
Valley, down 40 miles south of Missoula, at Victor, Montana.
06:08
And that was more of the same.
06:10
I just did everything in the woods that was possible, fished and
06:14
swam, and went into the mountains, and just enjoyed it immensely.
06:20
So now, in addition to your father, did you have any teacher in grade school,
06:25
middle school or high school that was an especially important mentor to you
06:29
in terms of being interested in the outdoors, science or natural history?
06:34
Nothing, not that I remember.
06:35
So your father was your mentor then?
06:36
My father as my mentor, and the woods itself.
06:40
And what was your father's name?
06:41
Floren.
06:41
Floren.
06:42
Floren Levno.
06:43
Floren Levno.
06:44
Yeah.
06:48
Now, how did you look at nature out there?
06:54
I mean, Montana, Big Sky Country.
06:57
The mountains, the sky, everything's big.
07:02
Did you have a view about how the land would be managed or what
07:08
was happening on the land, or you just wanted to be out there?
07:13
Yeah, I had no idea what the concepts were of anything at that point.
07:19
Eureka was a logging town and pretty much, rough, tough loggers.
07:25
And the object was to get the trees off the land, and do the Christmas trees
07:30
and try to make a living with the trees.
07:32
Sawmills were there.
07:34
People in the church were sawmill owners.
07:37
But
07:39
there was nothing about preservation or the big picture.
07:44
It was all about getting the wood off the land.
07:47
Right, and that would have been?
07:49
That was in 1940's, yeah.
07:54
Forties, early '50s maybe?
07:56
Around early '50s.
08:00
So, any memories about any of the loggers or the big
08:06
entrepreneurs that you remember?
08:10
In Eureka or even down, further down south of Missoula?
08:14
You know, we're talking, I was in third-fourth grade at that time.
08:20
General impressions mostly?
08:21
So, it was general impressions of being out in the forest.
08:28
Now, how would you describe the ecology of Montana today?
08:34
And how do you think you looked at it when you were a kid?
08:41
The ecology of today is, it's a varied state of many variables.
08:43
You know,
08:51
it has the deserts and the mountains, and the Bitterroot Valley and the rivers.
09:00
The
09:04
way I saw it was just a beautiful place to be.
09:08
A big playground basically?
09:09
A big playground.
09:13
Now, did you have any experiences outside of Montana in your formative years where
09:18
your family maybe visited somewhere else with a different look, whether the
09:24
Southwest or California or anywhere, or was it pretty much just in Montana?
09:28
It was pretty much Montana.
09:31
We were a very poor family and that's where we lived.
09:35
How many brothers and sisters did
09:38
you have?
09:39
The Indian boy that we tried to adopt when I was four or five still may be a
09:46
brother, although we don't keep in touch.
09:48
But in Eureka, my brother, Mark, was born.
09:54
And he was eight years younger than I am, so there's quite
09:59
an age difference between us.
10:00
So, there's just two brothers?
10:01
Just two brothers.
10:02
And the one, the Indian boy, the adoption didn't hold.
10:05
Right?
10:05
It didn't hold because he was found to have tuberculosis.
10:10
So, they thought it would be much more practical for him
10:15
to stay on the reservation.
10:20
Now, how do you think the location of your formative years in Montana affected
10:25
your views on science, ecology or what became your career in the Forest Service,
10:30
and specifically at the H.J. Andrews?
10:33
I think I was very well-prepared physically.
10:38
I knew the environment.
10:41
I could stay outside.
10:43
I saw 50 degrees below zero.
10:46
I
10:49
was just very comfortable in the woods, very strong as far as leg
10:56
strength, and I could go a long time.
11:00
I think that really paid off for me, and I'll get to that farther on the way.
11:08
Now, how do you think where you were raised affected your view on how you
11:15
might look at the concept of place?
11:17
When I mean place, a geographic place that becomes part of you, a home, if you will.
11:23
I mean, you obviously found a second home here at the Andrews and in Corvallis,
11:28
but the places you experienced when you were you Montana, how do you
11:33
think you transferred some of those feelings to your attachments that you
11:37
developed here in Oregon over 50 years?
11:39
Well, I think it was very much the same.
11:42
You know, it was the woods and it was trees and mountains and streams.
11:49
That was the place for me.
11:51
People were not so much.
11:55
[Laughs]
11:57
Now, I'm kind of jumping ahead here, but I wanted to throw
12:00
this in for you specifically.
12:02
You became the H.J. Andrews photographer at some time early in
12:06
your tenure there, an endeavor that has continued now into your retirement.
12:12
How did you become first interested in photography?
12:17
That was part of the job.
12:18
When I first got to the Andrews, there were retake pictures to be done.
12:21
So it wasn't something you learned when you were a kid, though?
12:26
No.
12:26
It was retake pictures with a 4-x-5 camera.
12:31
And you know, if you use a 4-x-5 camera, you begin to understand
12:35
photography pretty fast, because it's all manual F-stops and speeds.
12:40
And you just know your camera a lot better than many people
12:47
do with the automatic settings.
12:48
And the film's more expensive, so you have to take more care for each shot.
12:53
That's right.
12:53
And each film has to be loaded in the dark and into a cap,
13:03
whatever they are, and loaded into the camera.
13:06
And so, you developed a lot of knowledge just from that.
13:11
Then later, the single-lens reflex digital cameras came out.
13:17
I think my brother helped me a lot because he was more of an artsy person.
13:24
He took pictures for the art part of it, and I became very interested in that.
13:30
We 'll get into that more later, but I mainly wanted to find out if
13:36
there was something that happened before your professional life that
13:40
enamored you with photography?
13:42
No, it was all based on the Andrews.
13:49
Now, how and when did you enter the university system, and did you
13:54
know then what you wanted to study?
13:57
I was very adamant to be in the Forest Service.
14:02
So,
14:05
we did have to move from Montana.
14:07
We went to a very small church in Steptoe, Washington.
14:11
And there were maybe 14 kids in the high school; very small.
14:18
But each kid had a sewing machine.
14:20
It was a very wealthy farming community.
14:24
But that was the end of my father's career and he retired in Palouse,
14:30
Washington, where he could get a little farm and raise chickens and a cow.
14:35
So, I transferred from Steptoe High School, I think in my sophomore or
14:42
junior year, and went to Palouse.
14:47
And that was a little more familiar, as I was very lost in Steptoe because it
14:52
was just rolling hills and farm land.
14:54
You lost your point of reference, the big mountains and trees.
14:56
I did.
14:56
I just could not live in that type of a situation.
15:01
So, Palouse was a little bit better.
15:04
And then it was getting to the point where I was getting old enough, I got
15:09
my first job with the Forest Service.
15:11
Oh my gosh!
15:12
Was I excited!
15:13
It was between my junior and senior year in high school.
15:16
And I was a little behind.
15:19
But I got to go out in the Ouster Rust Control business in northern Idaho.
15:27
And of course, there is
15:29
-- Up by Sandpoint?
15:30
No, it was by Potlatch, Idaho, and into the Coeur d'Alene National Forest.
15:38
Okay, a little south of that, okay.
15:38
Yeah.
15:40
Basically, the thought was at that time, was that they could cure
15:44
the White Pine Blister Rust by attacking the ribes [currant or
15:48
gooseberry - host species] . So,
15:51
they organized thousands of college kids to come in every summer, then set
15:57
up plots and assist them to go through and hunt for ribes and pull them out.
16:08
I was so fortunate to get in even before I graduated from high school.
16:14
Now, was there ever a time when you were in Montana, either up in the north or down
16:20
south in Missoula, where you ever remember either watching or having an experience
16:26
or meeting a Forest Service person, a ranger, supervisor, or technician,
16:32
that made an impression on you?
16:34
Not until I got to the Forest Service in
16:39
Potlatch, Idaho.
16:40
You just knew it existed, though, right?
16:41
I just knew it existed.
16:44
But then I really started paying attention to the forest, and I got to know the
16:48
supervisors and find out what the forest was all about and what forest people did.
16:59
Then the next year was graduation.
17:03
My father, I remember, taking me over to Washington State University
17:07
and introducing me to some professors, and then we were ready
17:14
to go on with a college career.
17:16
So, now, what kind of program did Washington State have?
17:21
It was called Washington State College, I believe at that time.
17:24
Right?
17:24
At that time.
17:24
What kind of program did they have regarding forestry?
17:29
I think it was just a basic Forest Service program.
17:32
Yeah, just pretty basic.
17:35
And how long did you stay at Washington State?
17:38
Well, after I graduated, I started college and did pretty well the first
17:46
year-and-a-half, and then I got married.
17:52
Before too long I had two children, and then it became very, very difficult for
17:58
me to do school and try to raise a family.
18:01
I remember working at the
18:04
Potlatch lumber mill on the pond, pushing logs into the sawmill.
18:11
I would work there from 5:00 at night until 2:00 in the morning,
18:17
and then, drive 30 miles home, and try to go to school from 10:00
18:24
until 2:00 or something like that.
18:26
It just didn't work out.
18:28
Yeah, I failed at that.
18:32
That was a little bit too much multi-tasking for you at that time?
18:34
Yes.
18:36
And then
18:39
I was really in a fix.
18:40
How
18:43
much had you completed at Washington State by that time?
18:45
A year and some.
18:48
And I was really in a fix, because the Northern Idaho Forest Service
18:53
basically shut down in the winter time.
18:55
I mean, there's maybe three people at a ranger station.
18:59
The rest of the people - a few people went to the supervisor's office, and there were
19:03
no jobs for a person without an education.
19:08
I
19:11
just didn't know whether I was going to finish school or not, so I had to find
19:16
another avenue, another livelihood.
19:21
And I thought that maybe a nursery business would be a good substitute.
19:29
I knew my plants.
19:31
I was good and strong, and I picked up the landscape business very well.
19:40
Did you learn a lot about plants from your mother or your father?
19:44
I mean, did you have nice gardens?
19:45
Yes.
19:47
Yeah, dad was always a person that had the garden and he always tried
19:51
to be the first one to have a crop.
19:53
Even in northern Montana?
19:55
Yeah, northern Montana.
19:57
Slightly shorter growing season than here?
19:58
That's right.
20:00
So, but then this was a problem with the Palouse country, and the
20:05
winters are quite severe there.
20:09
The landscaping business basically shut down in the winter time.
20:14
So, what am I going to do?
20:16
I've got my family to feed.
20:19
Then
20:22
I thought, "Aha! I'll go to Eugene, Oregon, and I'll get a
20:25
job down there because they have landscaping year-round down there."
20:31
I came down to Eugene and went to Reed & Cross Nursery.
20:35
Bam!
20:35
I got a job just like that.
20:37
Bam!
20:39
For a buck-and-a-quarter an hour.
20:41
That wasn't too terrible back then.
20:43
That wasn't too bad.
20:44
Yeah.
20:45
So, I went back.
20:47
We picked up my family.
20:50
I had a Jeep pickup and we got a big U-Haul trailer.
20:55
This was a 4-cylinder Jeep.
20:57
We put the appliances in the back of the Jeep, we loaded up the trailer
21:03
and we came over the hill, and went 30 miles-an-hour some places.
21:08
But we made it to Eugene and started a new life.
21:13
Then I thought, "Well, you know, maybe I'll switch and do
21:18
landscaping." So, I went to the University of Oregon night school
21:23
whenever I could for design courses.
21:27
And then I learned a tremendous amount from Reed & Cross Nursery because that was
21:32
one of the big establishments in Eugene.
21:36
They did expert landscaping for all the
21:42
major businesses and homes in Eugene, the Rubensteins and
21:46
-- They were on Coburg Road, weren't they?
21:48
Yes, they were on Coburg Road, and I lived right near Coburg Road.
21:55
I did very well there.
21:56
They really appreciated my knowledge, and I specialized in selling big trees,
22:06
landscape trees, to lawyers and doctors.
22:10
And I was pretty good at it.
22:12
I didn't get along
22:15
with the landscape person, Ed Cross, very well.
22:19
But Reed Volstad was just wonderful, and he thought I was wonderful.
22:24
So, then I began to look around and I said, "Hey, this is a
22:28
different part of the world.
22:29
This is not Montana.
22:31
There is a lot of forestry going on in the winter time here.
22:35
And maybe I should check that out."
22:39
So this is all taking place in about a two-year period of time after you came?
22:43
This is, yeah.
22:43
Two or three years after you came to Eugene then?
22:45
We came to Eugene in 1961.
22:48
Okay.
22:54
And so, in late in 1962, I made a trip to the Blue River Ranger
22:58
Station and I asked for a job.
23:00
Yeah, they had a job, and it was being a road designer.
23:06
They would train me and I would have a permanent job there.
23:11
But the pay was even less than what I was making at the nursery,
23:16
and so I turned that job down.
23:17
I went back and I worked the winter at the nursery.
23:23
And then things got a little worse with Ed Cross, and I said, "Well, maybe I should
23:29
think some more seriously about that job at the Forest Service." I went back and
23:38
that job was filled.
23:40
They said, "But the guys down at the bottom of the ranger station, the
23:44
experimental people [H.J. Andrews EF staff] , are looking for a person."
23:50
So, I marched down the stairs to talk with them and they said, "Yeah,
23:54
yeah, we're trying to hire a person."
23:57
And who was the first person that you met?
23:58
This was Dick Fredriksen [Forest Service hydrologist] , who was there.
24:01
And this was in this little, tiny office, maybe the size of this room`.
24:08
It was within the Blue River Ranger District building.
24:12
Correct?
24:12
It was in the basement of the Blue River Ranger Station.
24:14
One room, two desks.
24:18
There was old 100-key calculators and typewriters.
24:25
There was one balance beam, one oven,
24:32
and charts and stuff on the wall.
24:35
That was it.
24:35
So, what did they tell you that they were doing at this experimental forest?
24:39
They were doing the experimental forest then [forestry, regeneration,
24:42
hydrology and erosion experiments] , and I was so impressed.
24:44
I mean, to think that you could take a piece of land and three watersheds
24:50
and make a scientific study out of that where one was a control and treat
24:56
the other two, and record the results.
25:00
Oh man.
25:01
That was just wonderful.
25:03
That was my first knowledge of any science that was done in the Forest Service.
25:11
But you had to apply for this job and there were many applicants.
25:16
And what was the job description?
25:22
[Break in audio]
25:25
So, you were applying for this position and there were a lot of applicants,
25:31
How did you happen to get that job?
25:32
Yeah, this is kind of interesting.
25:37
Dick
25:39
Fredriksen, as I found out, was probably not operating
25:44
according to government standards.
25:47
Because he provided his own test so that he could determine
25:52
the field thinking ability.
25:57
Aptitude, if you will?
25:58
That's right.
25:58
Aptitude, maybe the knowledge, to create something in the field and make
26:04
things happen, which is what he needed.
26:08
And
26:10
so, there was this test and we had to do that one.
26:13
Then
26:16
I took the test and I didn't think too much about it.
26:21
You know, I figured, there's a small chance.
26:23
You figured the competition was pretty steep?
26:24
Yeah, I thought that, yes, it was very steep.
26:29
Then a month or two later, I got a call on the phone, and Dick said he'd
26:36
like to go out and show me the forest.
26:42
So, I showed up at the appropriate time and there were five other
26:46
people there in one station wagon.
26:52
I was intimidated by the people that were there, and I didn't really
27:00
expect much out of that.
27:01
Were these the other applicants, or was this
27:05
-? These was the other applicants.
27:06
So it wasn't the Andrews people of the early days, like Jerry Franklin
27:10
and Jack Rothacher, it was just Dick and the five other applicants?
27:14
No, it was just Dick.
27:15
That's right.
27:19
A lot of people weren't there during this particular time.
27:22
Jerry was off, I think, getting a doctorate at Washington State,
27:32
and Dick was the only one from the Forest [Andrews] that was there.
27:36
Jack Rothacher wasn't around, and Ted Dyrness wasn't there.
27:40
So, Dick Fredriksen was the person.
27:46
We went around and got in the station wagon, all of us, and we
27:50
went around to check rain gauges.
28:03
One of the stops was at the Spot Fire Unit on Watershed 1.
28:10
And that is three-quarters of the way to the top of Watershed 1.
28:13
And then you could look down in the valley and the logging, the Swiss
28:20
Wyssen skyline system was going.
28:22
So that was actually going at that time?
28:23
It was going at that very time, yeah.
28:26
And the yarder was up at the top of the watershed, and then, a mile
28:30
down at the bottom was the landing.
28:33
But there was this extremely steep slope between the rain gauge spot
28:40
where we were in the road, and the top of the hill where the yarder was.
28:45
And this was on the McKenzie River side of the canyon, right?
28:50
Yes, I guess it would be.
28:51
Right.
28:51
But it's right at the edge.
28:52
You're lower down on the Lookout Mountain Ridge, right?
28:56
You're kind of out, but farther out to the west, right?
28:59
That's right.
29:00
Okay.
29:00
Yeah.
29:03
So, Dick suggested that we go up
29:07
and take a look at the yarder.
29:10
Oh, for crying out
29:14
loud.
29:14
[Clock chiming] We take a look
29:17
at the yarder.
29:18
We tried.
29:24
[Laughs - clock chimes again] We're making a joke about the clock
29:25
that won't shut up, but anyway.
29:27
Okay,
29:29
continue.
29:30
So, Dick suggested that we, just the five of us, go up and take a
29:35
look at the yarder while he emptied the rain gauge and did the check.
29:41
And so, three or four of the guys, husky guys, just made a beeline for the slope.
29:51
And I think I and another guy just kind of tagged along behind, and
29:58
they were just charging up the slope.
30:00
But pretty soon, one of them stopped, and he was breathing and panting and
30:05
panting, and I just went right on by him.
30:10
The a little bit farther up the slope, another guy was just
30:15
standing on a stump, panting.
30:19
And I had no problem, as I went right up to the top and looked at the yarder.
30:24
Then everybody else kind of scrambled up a little later.
30:29
I don't know whether that was a test or not, but I did very well.
30:35
But the tortoise won the race.
30:36
Yeah, that's right.
30:38
[Laughs] And that, I think, was from my ability to be in the woods.
30:42
I knew it and had done that before, and I'd played all those games
30:47
with the college kids in Idaho.
30:51
I just knew the woods and I knew what I could do.
30:54
So, your Montana credo came through.
30:58
That's the reason I explained all this Montana stuff.
31:00
No, that's very good, yes.
31:03
Then again, I didn't know what was going on.
31:05
But maybe a month later, they called me up and said, "Hey, you've got
31:10
the job if you want it." And wow, I was excited, but it's quite a job to
31:17
move your family to Blue River and
31:20
-- Wanted your wife and your kids to come out then?
31:22
Yeah, well.
31:24
Your kids were pretty young.
31:25
The kids were and I had a third kid by then, David, the son.
31:30
So, we had to try to make arrangements because there was no place to live
31:35
in Corvallis or in Blue River.
31:41
The Cougar Reservoir was just being completed, and that was a tremendous push
31:51
and boost to the economy of the area.
31:54
Many people went back-and-forth every day from Blue River to Eugene.
32:00
Or Springfield.
32:01
Yeah, and many people died on that road [US 126].
32:05
Red Dog Curve, it was a really, treacherous thing.
32:08
But there were a lot of trailer houses there, and we did find one.
32:12
It was for $500, we got a two-bedroom trailer.
32:19
You bought it?
32:20
Bought it, yeah.
32:22
So, your first purchased home was a trailer?
32:24
Actually, it was the second.
32:26
We had the one in Eugene.
32:27
Oh, okay.
32:29
So, we got it and the only place to put it was up in the, well, there was
32:34
a kind of a trailer court up above the ranger station where a few of
32:39
the people that worked there stayed.
32:41
There was an empty space and we got to move in there, and
32:48
after that, we started work.
32:51
What was the community of Blue River like at that time?
32:56
The community of Blue River was, I think, you know, up-and-going, but kind
33:01
of maybe losing a little bit because the reservoir had just been completed.
33:07
But there was a grocery store.
33:09
You're taking about the Cougar Reservoir, though?
33:09
The Cougar Reservoir.
33:10
When
33:13
did the Blue River Reservoir get completed?
33:15
That was few years before that.
33:15
The Blue River Reservoir was after that, 1975 [started in 1968, finished
33:17
and filled, early to mid-1970s].
33:18
Oh, okay.
33:21
So, this is 1963 when we were there.
33:22
I got my chronology backwards, okay.
33:26
There was a grocery store, two grocery stores, a meat department
33:31
there, a post office and restaurants.
33:35
And a couple of bars and a barber shop.
33:39
And it was really a pretty good town.
33:44
The infamous Cougar Room was one of them.
33:45
The Cougar Room.
33:45
I have many stories with the Cougar Room.
33:48
[Laughs]
33:48
Yes, but you don't want to tell me too many of
33:52
those, right?
33:53
[Laughs] I've heard them from my friends
33:56
anyway.
33:58
Now, did you have to go back and complete your schooling at
34:01
any time during this process?
34:06
No.
34:07
Only with the landscape endeavor did I do any schooling.
34:16
If we go on a little bit farther, then the schooling comes.
34:19
Okay, that's fine.
34:21
So, tell me about your first interaction with the Andrews
34:29
aside from the test that you got.
34:32
I mean, after you were actually hired, what was your first job?
34:37
What was your first task as an employee working out of Blue River
34:42
under --- Was your boss Dick Fredriksen?
34:44
Dick Fredriksen and I were the only ones at Blue River at that time, yeah.
34:48
Where was Jack Rothacher at that time?
34:50
Jack Rothacher was in Corvallis.
34:51
Okay.
34:52
And Ted Dyrness was.
34:55
And I think they mainly came during the summer time,
34:58
although Jack was there a lot.
35:00
And Jerry Franklin was also in Corvallis?
35:03
Jerry Franklin was there in Corvallis, yes.
35:06
He never showed up at the Andrews.
35:09
Well, I shouldn't say never, but he was very, very seldom there.
35:14
So, what was your first job?
35:16
Well, the first job was learning how to service the watersheds and
35:20
to take care of the rain gauges.
35:21
And it was very different because it was very primitive.
35:29
We had no electricity.
35:31
I mean, the only power we had was a flashlight, I think.
35:36
All the instruments were weight-driven clocks, and scales for measuring rainfall.
35:43
So,
35:45
you know, it was primitive.
35:47
And the only thing we had was one station wagon.
35:50
It was a Studebaker station wagon that was pretty new.
35:53
That was the only thing the Andrews had.
35:56
We didn't have a chain saw.
35:57
We didn't have anything, because we were supposed to go to the
36:01
district and get our material.
36:04
How many roads were in the Andrews?
36:06
Do you recall?
36:06
The roads were pretty much laid out by Roy Silen and his work before.
36:07
That had pretty much been done.
36:07
There was a little bit of continuing road work and logging going on.
36:07
But they [roads] was pretty well laid out.
36:25
So, the center of the road system that we see today was
36:28
already in place by that time?
36:30
Yes, it was.
36:31
And even the extensions that were made later on, spurs or whatever,
36:36
were those basically based on Roy's original plan, correct?
36:40
That's right, yeah.
36:41
Roy was everyplace.
36:42
And still today, you think you've been a place at the Andrews where
36:46
nobody's ever been before, and an aluminum tag shows up on a tree, and
36:51
you look at it, and it's Roy Silen.
36:56
I guess, Roy has passed on and I don't know if there's much information there.
37:02
Maybe Jerry will have a lot of information.
37:04
But I remember one particular story.
37:07
He [Silen] was a bachelor at that time, and he lived in a trailer there.
37:13
I don't think it was in the same trailer court, and he worked all the time.
37:18
Then people would come up on the weekends from Eugene and around,
37:22
and he would take them fishing.
37:24
So, he very seldom got out of the
37:29
area.
37:31
The word was that when his paycheck would come in, he would put it in
37:37
the window of his little trailer.
37:39
And then he'd go off, do other things and fish.
37:46
He worked 10 days on and 4 days off.
37:51
So, he was in the woods, lived under just a tarp, and didn't come out for 10 days.
38:02
A couple of the assistants, and I don't know who they were right
38:05
now, but they hated to go with him because they were married.
38:08
It
38:10
was a 10-day stretch every 14 days.
38:14
They'd go back and lay out the road system.
38:18
As the summer went on, he kept putting his checks in the window, and then,
38:24
in October, I guess he thought, "Well, it's time to take them to the
38:27
bank." He went to look at them, and the mice had got into his checks.
38:34
The people in Portland said that was a most humorous situation
38:38
when he showed up in Portland with these paychecks, the stubs of them.
38:43
So, the "hermit of the forest" had lost his checks to mice.
38:47
To mice.
38:49
And he wanted to have them replaced.
38:52
I have not heard that story.
38:54
That's a great story.
38:58
That's even better, maybe, than the "ghetto-in-the-meadow," [name for
39:00
Andrews "campus" in 1980s, mostly decrepit GSA surplus trailers]
39:01
fall through the floor stories.
39:02
Right?
39:03
Yeah.
39:04
[Laughs]
39:04
Which we'll get to later.
39:07
Very good.
39:08
Excellent.
39:09
Okay.
39:10
So, Roy was everywhere though?
39:12
Roy was everywhere.
39:13
He knew the forest.
39:14
And still is today.
39:14
And I did get to spend some time with Roy in the woods.
39:18
He knew every curve and every road.
39:20
He knew why it was there, he knew this, and he had just an unbelievable
39:26
memory of what he'd done in that park.
39:28
[exp.
39:28
forest]
39:28
And he was only out there for five or six years?
39:31
Correct?
39:31
Yes.
39:32
And maybe not even that long.
39:34
Wow, that's incredible.
39:36
He was an incredible person.
39:37
It's incredible how somebody that was hired basically as a lone wolf, and I
39:42
think he got a little help in the last two years he was there, who basically
39:49
left and rarely returned after he left
39:51
-- Rarely did, yeah.
39:53
-- would have such an impact on a place that really, you couldn't
39:58
have guessed that the legacy of the Andrews would become what it did?
40:02
Yeah, that's right.
40:03
But that somebody like him in that brief period of time when he was fighting
40:08
against the grain of industrial forestry and all the things that were wanted,
40:13
some people wanted to have happen on the land, but he would have all of this
40:17
influence in many ways, still today?
40:19
Yeah, that's right.
40:21
How interesting.
40:22
Wow.
40:22
Yeah.
40:23
That is really fascinating.
40:25
So, go back to your early tasks and job description, and learning
40:31
how to do the monitoring and the watersheds in those early days?
40:36
Okay.
40:39
I mentioned how primitive our working conditions and materials were.
40:47
And it was very difficult.
40:48
I think the first year I was there, the first winter, oh, my gosh,
40:53
the place just about closed down.
40:56
There was no traffic.
40:57
There was no snowmobiles.
41:01
There was nothing.
41:02
If you wanted to get someplace, you couldn't push through
41:05
the snow with a Studebaker.
41:08
This was the winter of '63-'64, correct?
41:11
'63, yeah.
41:12
But into '64, right?
41:13
Yeah, yeah.
41:13
But this is the year before the big flood, though.
41:15
Correct?
41:15
That's right, yeah.
41:18
So, if you wanted to go anyplace, it was snowshoes.
41:20
You had to do snowshoes.
41:22
So, the other thing that was happening was that they were
41:26
thinking about putting watersheds in at Hi-15, which is at 3,000 feet.
41:33
We had no idea what that meant, and I think we didn't realize what the
41:38
problems were going to be in the winter time to get into those places.
41:43
In the first winter, I got to spend some time with Jack.
41:48
And Jack was just, you know, you can't give that guy enough credit.
41:53
He was a ranger in the North Umpqua [National] Forest, and then he
41:58
gave that job up to come to the Andrews and be a hydrologist.
42:02
He lived in the big house set aside for the Andrews Experimental
42:07
Forest, right by the ranger's house.
42:10
Now, when did that start being the house for the Andrews?
42:14
Do you know?
42:14
I think it was built that way.
42:15
And I think maybe the research people did provide a little
42:18
bit of money for that house.
42:20
And that would have been money through the PNW Station.
42:22
Correct?
42:22
Yes, that's right.
42:25
So, we had one flume put in.
42:31
Very temporary.
42:32
We built kind of a temporary shelter.
42:34
This was up in the Hi-15?
42:35
Yes.
42:37
The Hi-15 encompasses what would be called Watersheds 6, 7 and 8.
42:42
Right?
42:42
7 and 8 [numbers used - formal names for watersheds], that's right.
42:45
So, we had the control watershed, and we went ahead and put a flume in there.
42:52
That was in addition to the work that was going on in the lower watershed.
42:56
And you did this during the winter time?
42:58
We did it and had it completed in the fall.
43:02
So, our clock time was I think
43:07
fourteen days, or maybe eight days, an eight-day clock on that.
43:12
It required that somebody get up there to wind the clock every eight days.
43:18
And the snow came down, so Jack came down to help me go up there one week.
43:28
How long did it take you to get there?
43:30
We started at 6:00 in the morning.
43:33
There was fresh snow, and it was maybe three feet deep.
43:41
And in that country, our country, the snow is very wet and very
43:46
heavy, and your snowshoes sink down.
43:50
So, in three feet of snow, you could sink in two feet.
43:56
It was extremely difficult.
43:59
It just was.
44:01
So, we decided we would take turns breaking trail.
44:05
He would go for fifty steps, and then I would break trail for fifty steps.
44:13
[Clock chime.] Shall we stop and take that thing off?
44:18
[Break in audio]
44:19
Okay, so we're trying to get up to the Hi-15 to make the
44:21
checks and wind the clock.
44:24
We decided it's very difficult, and then we would try to do fifty
44:29
steps, break trail, because, it's much easier for the guy behind.
44:34
We started on that, and we got wore out.
44:37
So, we changed to ten steps.
44:40
Ten steps, break trail, step off, and the other person would go ten steps.
44:45
And we got to the Lookout Creek Bridge.
44:51
Fortunately, the snow began to get a little firmer and we were able to
44:55
finish the other seven miles up to the gauging station and make our check.
45:00
And of course, coming back down in the already broken trail was a lot easier.
45:08
But you came back in the dark, didn't you?
45:10
But it was 6:00 when we
45:11
-- And it was dark by then?
45:12
We started at Watershed 2, so it was a very long hike.
45:16
But that's what Jack was capable of doing.
45:19
He could do that.
45:19
He was the project leader, the head of the project.
45:25
He would come out and work with just anybody.
45:31
He really good and treated everybody fairly.
45:34
I
45:36
think I want to say, he told me,
45:43
Jerry was up and coming, and he'd already done his Master's degree.
45:50
Jerry, I think, had trouble with
45:55
a lot of supervisors, as they didn't give him enough space.
45:58
He was thinking way beyond them.
46:01
But Jack said, "Well, you know, Jerry's a very, very smart guy, and
46:06
I'm just going to give him whatever room he needs to operate." So, he
46:14
didn't want to control his territory to near the extent that I've seen in
46:20
other experimental forests or anything.
46:23
Jack was very willing to share and to take on new tasks, new science, new ideas.
46:30
And like I said, he was very fair and very good to me.
46:34
When I moved into that research community, I felt like I was part of the family.
46:40
He and the team were just exceptional.
46:42
Regarding Jerry, it seems like he's the kind of person
46:47
that would refuse to be caged.
46:50
That is right.
46:51
That is absolutely right.
46:52
Is that a good way of expressing it?
46:53
It is.
46:54
So, in other words, a lot of the things that became Jerry's now famous,
46:58
legendary, still ongoing career, was aided by somebody like Jack saying, "You
47:04
know, let that guy do his thing." Right?
47:07
That's right.
47:08
That's right.
47:08
That's good.
47:11
That's very good.
47:11
Interesting.
47:12
So, tell me a little bit more about Dick Fredriksen?
47:16
You know,
47:19
Dick doesn't get enough credit.
47:21
He had lots of problems later in his career.
47:26
And I think maybe he had Alzheimer's or dementia that
47:30
came on that nobody knew about.
47:32
Early onset, what we call early onset today?
47:34
Yeah.
47:36
But what a strong,
47:40
very thorough science person.
47:43
And I think he made the watershed program what it's famous for today,
47:49
because he was very thorough.
47:51
He was the first one that I know of that made check sheets for us
47:57
to follow every strict detail.
47:59
And we never deviated from that procedure one little bit.
48:05
So, in other words, you had your instrumentation tapes, but you also
48:12
had your check sheets that you manually would verify and check and record
48:17
as you're in the field, correct?
48:19
Everything was, yeah, everything was done properly.
48:23
All the information was recorded, and it was recorded correctly.
48:28
If anything I was able to do to pass on to other people, that was it,
48:33
and even Greg [Downing] and Craig [Creel] will tell you that today
48:37
[Both U.S. Forest Service technicians]
48:37
. And you're talking about Greg Downing and Craig Creel, correct?
48:41
Yeah.
48:42
They're the latest people in the field.
48:45
They will tell you that the Andrews is a real stickler for keeping the quality of
48:55
their data good, and pure and consistent.
49:00
I know some other experimental forests and experimental LTER
49:05
sites don't have that record.
49:07
The Andrews has a very good record for being precise and
49:12
producing usable information over 50 years, 60 years of time.
49:18
Now, Dick Fredriksen was from Minnesota, correct?
49:24
He might be, yeah.
49:26
I don't know that much about him.
49:27
I know he went to school in Seattle.
49:31
Oh, okay.
49:32
And he got a master's degree there.
49:37
And he had a very tough time of it.
49:39
Now, didn't he eventually get a doctorate?
49:41
He did.
49:42
And we can go into that, much more.
49:43
Okay, we'll go into it later.
49:46
But he, I think, set a very good example for very good record-keeping.
49:54
And that has been passed on through.
49:56
Would you say that Dick is the most influential person at the
49:59
Andrews regarding that one thing?
50:01
Yes.
50:03
How about Jack?
50:04
Was he more of a field guy, more of a get-out-and-do-it thing, or was
50:08
he equally a stickler for detail?
50:11
Not as much a stickler for detail, but very get-out-and-do-it.
50:16
And, you know, do it right and stay out there until it's done right, and take on
50:23
projects and make sure they're done right.
50:27
Now, we're going to go
50:27
-- Well, maybe, now, there's time for a story?
50:32
We always have time for stories.
50:34
This is kind of jumping ahead.
50:36
But that's fine.
50:37
Just so you know, these are not linear.
50:40
The memory is a many-faceted, a big, mysterious thing, so
50:44
Al, go where you want to go.
50:45
Okay.
50:46
I think it was after the '64 flood.
50:49
And, of course, the Watershed 3 canyon gauge house and sediment basin were washed
50:55
completely off the face of the Earth.
50:57
They found the recorder for the station two years later,
51:01
two miles down the stream.
51:04
So, we had to replace all that stuff.
51:06
And it came time to do the sediment basin which required a lot of big cedar,
51:13
heavy cedar, a lot of cedar planks.
51:17
At that time, we had a sawmill right there in Blue River [the town] . And
51:22
we took on the job to do that.
51:24
We got our logs in place, we got the basin dug.
51:28
The Logs in place, we needed the lumber, we just needed the lumber for the dam.
51:33
And this would have been the summer after the big flood, correct?
51:36
'65. ["Christmas Flood" of 1964 had two parts; Dec. 1964/Jan.
51:38
1965]
51:38
. '65, right.
51:39
Or maybe '66.
51:40
It took a while to get things going.
51:42
But Jack was there.
51:44
Okay.
51:44
So, we ordered the lumber, 4
51:48
x 12's or something, from the local mill.
51:52
And then we had to borrow a Forest Service truck to haul all this lumber,
51:59
the big, long planks, maybe 16-18 feet.
52:04
I guess we loaded it too heavy.
52:07
We had too much wood on there.
52:09
And so, as a final safety measure, I guess you might call it, Jack and I decided to
52:17
get on the top of the truck and hold the boards down while Dick drove the truck.
52:24
And of course, we had to go right by the ranger station.
52:27
The safety officer happened to look up, he told me later
52:30
that he looked up and saw that.
52:31
And then he saw who was on the back of the truck and he
52:34
said, "Oh, well, forget that."
52:37
And you probably didn't have hard hats on, either?
52:40
We would have done it, yeah.
52:42
That's the way we operated.
52:44
Get it done.
52:45
So, Jack was good at that also.
52:49
So, you went up and did this sediment basin work with that
52:54
wood later on that year, right?
52:55
Yes, we got that completed with Jack's help.
53:01
We'll talk a little more later about the rebuilding process from Christmas
53:05
Flood of 1964, which actually continued into early 1965, and you've
53:11
got some stories regarding that.
53:12
So, any other people or personalities from those early days that you
53:17
remember, any Forest Service people like
53:21
--? Yeah.
53:25
We moved into that Forest Service community and it was just the
53:29
most wonderful time in my life.
53:33
We participated with the people.
53:35
We went to parties.
53:36
We had friends that we have had for life after that.
53:42
So, that relationship with the Forest Service people right there on the
53:47
compound was just a wonderful experience.
53:53
The ranger was a tough guy.
53:55
He was more about getting the wood out.....but
54:00
-- What was his name?
54:01
Bob Burns?
54:02
Okay, Bob
54:06
Burns.
54:06
He didn't think much of the experimental forest [Andrews] , and
54:09
thought we were wasting their time.
54:11
But he
54:14
turned out to be our neighbor, he was very compassionate to our
54:19
family, and we got along very well.
54:22
Where did your kids go to school when you were up there?
54:24
No, the kids weren't in school yet.
54:26
Okay.
54:26
They were still that young.
54:28
My oldest daughter, Sherry, did start kindergarten at that place.
54:34
But, the other kids were too young.
54:38
Now, so if you were going to overview the infrastructure at that early
54:43
time, how would you describe the infrastructure of the Andrews?
54:47
You told me about the different watersheds and developing the roads, but if you were
54:51
going to give a thumbnail sketch of what was there your first year, what was there?
54:57
Oh, yeah.
54:58
I told you about the office.
54:59
That's all there was.
55:01
Just that one room in the basement, correct?
55:02
One room in the basement.
55:03
We had just our one Studebaker station wagon.
55:08
No chainsaw.
55:11
No snow-cat?
55:13
No.
55:13
No snow-cat.
55:14
Snowshoes.
55:14
We had snowshoes that were made by the Indians.
55:18
They actually chewed the leather to make it soft enough to get on there.
55:22
And we had to make sure they were varnished, and so they would keep
55:26
the leather from getting wet.
55:29
What kind of radios did you have at that time?
55:30
We had no radios.
55:31
No radios?
55:32
We had nothing.
55:33
So, you went out there on these snow things.
55:35
If you fell and broke your leg, you'd be out there with a broken leg?
55:39
Yeah.
55:40
And by myself.
55:41
I was by myself a lot of the time.
55:44
Was that ever scary at times?
55:46
Hey, I came from Montana.
55:48
[Laughs]
55:49
Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, Al. You're a Big Sky kid.
55:52
My apologies.
55:53
We have a real man in the house.
55:57
No, pretty stupid.
55:57
Humor is permitted
56:02
in my interviews.
56:02
[Laughs] So, you were saying, "Hah, this is not real weather, right?"
56:05
That's right.
56:07
Well, I got fooled.
56:10
You're continuing about the infrastructure?
56:14
Yeah, so there was just the three watersheds.
56:16
And the other study that was ongoing was the soil moisture study on Watershed 3.
56:24
That was started before logging in Watershed 3.
56:30
And so that was going on.
56:33
The roads, you know, you kind of had to watch the roads and the loggers and
56:38
make sure everything was going well.
56:43
Three watersheds, and we had a huge rain gauge route that we had to maintain.
56:53
So, basically, it was very simple.
56:55
But there was the road up to Carpenter Mountain, right?
56:58
The road to Carpenter Mountain was there.
57:00
And of course, that was staffed in the summertime, right?
57:04
That was, yes.
57:05
What do you remember about any of the personalities at the lookouts
57:09
[staff on Carpenter Mtn.] , because they're notoriously eccentric usually?
57:11
Yes, they are.
57:12
And do you remember any of those people?
57:13
No, I don't think, maybe I was more on the Roy Silen level there, where I was pretty
57:20
challenged with the job I had to do.
57:23
So, I didn't do a lot of running around.
57:25
But I guess we were up there, yeah.
57:30
Now, you were a technician and researcher, all the different things you've done.
57:34
Now, were you technically-inclined when you were a youth, or did you kind of
57:38
learn how to be technical on the job?
57:45
That was all on the job from Dick Fredriksen.
57:48
He was very good, and
57:53
so I learned most of what I knew from Dick Fredriksen.
57:57
I did have some mechanical experience.
57:59
I knew how to work on cars and do simple things like that.
58:04
Now, the equipment back then, was it fairly easy to repair, if you had to
58:09
repair it, and it was more mechanical?
58:12
[Not digital in modern sense] . For example, it wasn't complex
58:14
computers like we have now.
58:16
Yeah, it was very simple.
58:17
A weight-driven clock.
58:19
And you could actually take the clocks and you could clean them
58:24
yourself and make them run.
58:27
And those were fairly reliable?
58:29
They were very reliable as long as you got there before the wake hit
58:34
the bottom of the stilling well or the bottom of the rain gauge.
58:39
Now, were there problems with moisture ruining some of the tapes or records, and
58:44
did you have to be careful about that?
58:49
Yes, they were, but I think we had desiccants at that time, so maybe
58:53
that's the first thing we changed.
58:56
We did that every week.
58:58
Now, when did you start doing photography, immediately?
59:01
Yes, that came immediately.
59:03
That part of the job was to go back with this 4 x 5 camera and put it on a tripod.
59:11
And everything is upside down when you look through the viewfinder.
59:16
The lens opened up the back of the camera, and you look through the
59:21
lens, and everything is upside down.
59:23
So, you take your picture that you're trying to retake.
59:27
And you have to turn that upside down, and then look and
59:30
see, get your camera lined up.
59:33
So, you were doing repeat photography immediately?
59:35
Immediately, yes.
59:37
And that would have been from what Jack Rothacher had shot before?
59:39
Jack
59:42
Rothacher and Dick Fredriksen.
59:43
And Bob Ruth, too?
59:43
And Bob Ruth, yeah.
59:44
[Also Roy Silen, Hank Gratkowski, others.]
59:44
Okay.
59:45
And so, you were basically doing repeat photographing of
59:48
vegetation plots and revegetation of areas that had been treated.
59:53
Correct?
59:54
That's right, yeah.
59:54
Okay, so that was your first task.
59:57
They're saying this is kind of what you need to do to track vegetation,
1:00:02
regeneration, those kind of issues?
1:00:03
Uh-huh.
1:00:04
Also stream beds, or that was later?
1:00:07
Yeah, I think there were some, well, the '64 flood, of course, came.
1:00:10
And maybe that started more photography, but a lot of that was done by 4 x 5s.
1:00:16
Right, so this was all 4 x 5 stuff?
1:00:18
Mostly 4 x 5's.
1:00:19
[Large format] I think Jerry [Franklin] had a Bronica 2-1/4 x 2-1/4
1:00:23
[Medium format] camera that he used.
1:00:26
Yeah, a lot of the early photographs were, I've seen both
1:00:29
big format but also medium format.
1:00:31
[In H.J. Andrews E.F. historical archives.]
1:00:31
Yeah.
1:00:32
But there's also a lot of early slides, too, from 35mm.
1:00:37
Right?
1:00:37
Yeah, we started using the slide camera but, you know, it wasn't
1:00:41
considered good enough for science.
1:00:44
The 4 x 5 was the standard.
1:00:47
Well, it's because you've got the resolution.
1:00:49
That's right.
1:00:49
There's a lot to be said for that.
1:00:51
Yes, it is.
1:00:56
You wanted to say something about when Fredriksen left?
1:00:59
Yes.
1:00:59
Not within a year before I came on the job, we began to get word that Dick
1:01:07
was thinking about moving to Corvallis.
1:01:11
And we were thinking about getting out of that little two-bedroom
1:01:16
trailer because our family of
1:01:19
-- Five.
1:01:19
-- five, were really squeezed into that thing.
1:01:22
So, thinking about buying a house or moving out of there.
1:01:27
Dick began to hint, saying, "Well, you know, I can't promise
1:01:31
you anything, but maybe this house is going to be available."
1:01:36
What a beautiful house that was.
1:01:38
And something did happen.
1:01:42
Dick decided to go back to Corvallis.
1:01:45
I think that was
1:01:50
before '64, maybe late in '64.
1:01:55
And we moved into a nice, big three-bedroom house with a huge
1:02:01
fireplace, full basement, and wood floors.
1:02:06
Gorgeous place.
1:02:07
Never been in anything that beautiful.
1:02:09
What did you do with the trailer?
1:02:10
Did you sell it?
1:02:11
I think we sold the trailer.
1:02:12
It was $500?
1:02:13
Did you make a profit on it?
1:02:15
I know.
1:02:17
[Laughs] It was quite a job to get rid of it.
1:02:21
And we were right beside the Ranger Bob Burns, who was
1:02:25
supposed to be a very hard person.
1:02:28
He was a great neighbor.
1:02:31
Okay, that happened, and then,
1:02:35
I started thinking I need to continue my schooling.
1:02:41
So, there were some people at the ranger station that would go down to
1:02:46
the U of O and take classes at night.
1:02:50
So, I joined those guys and I started taking classes at night,
1:02:54
40 miles down to take a class, 40 miles back, and go to work.
1:02:58
And so, I did that.
1:03:01
So, I still had this idea of getting a degree still in my mind and was
1:03:06
working on it slowly, slowly, slowly.
1:03:10
But there I was.
1:03:11
Now I was stuck.
1:03:11
I was the only one at the Andrews.
1:03:13
I was the officer in charge of the Andrews.
1:03:16
Where was Jack Rothacher?
1:03:17
Jack Rothacher and the others, they were in Corvallis.
1:03:19
I was the only one in Blue River.
1:03:22
There was nobody else.
1:03:28
Now, you were talking about you being the only one up there.
1:03:32
Do you want to continue along that track?
1:03:34
Yeah, it was turned over to me, that whole thing, taking
1:03:39
care of the gauging stations.
1:03:40
And it was great.
1:03:42
It was just me and my Airedale Terrier.
1:03:47
We had a Dodge pickup by that time.
1:03:48
And what was the name of the Airedale?
1:03:49
Oh, of course, Tramp.
1:03:51
Tramp.
1:03:53
Lady and the Tramp, like that?
1:03:55
Like the movie?
1:03:56
Yeah, that's right.
1:03:59
So, we would patrol the Andrews and do the checks, and have
1:04:04
lunch with the loggers sometimes.
1:04:05
I'd sit down with the loggers that were doing a unit, and
1:04:09
-- Now, was Mike Savelich still there at that time?
1:04:11
Yes, Mike Savelich was there big-time, yes.
1:04:14
He was a tough logger.
1:04:15
His main motto was "Go or tear something up."
1:04:19
He was a big-old Croatian guy, wasn't he?
1:04:21
Yeah, he was.
1:04:22
So,
1:04:25
yeah, we'd stop and have lunch with the loggers.
1:04:28
They were great.
1:04:30
They would, you know, have these big meals and throw pieces of steak and
1:04:37
bread and cookies, and old Tramp would just run around and eat them all up.
1:04:43
And then we'd go on and try to do our work, and they'd go back to their work.
1:04:46
So, it was good.
1:04:49
I didn't mind being alone at all.
1:04:52
Except in the wintertime.
1:04:55
Then we started to make plans for the next winter.
1:04:59
And this was going to be the 1964, the winter of '64 and '65.
1:05:07
So, the plan was, Dick was involved with his master's degree.
1:05:12
So, he was back in Corvallis studying?
1:05:15
He was back in Corvallis.
1:05:15
I was the only one there.
1:05:16
And where was Jack by this time?
1:05:17
Jack was still in Corvallis.
1:05:19
Okay.
1:05:20
And Ted was there, too.
1:05:23
So, we began to make plans.
1:05:25
The plan was that,
1:05:28
the other thing that was mandatory was to take sediment samples from the
1:05:36
logged streams.
1:05:39
And they had to be done on a three-hour rotation during the rising leg of a
1:05:45
storm, because that's when the most sediment occurs on a rising leg.
1:05:51
So, it was very, very, very important to get that, the samples, during
1:05:56
the rising leg of the curve.
1:05:58
But the only thing we had to do it was drive out there and
1:06:05
climb up the hill to the trail or whatever it was, and then lay on that board that
1:06:12
goes across the flume, lay on your belly, and take a pint milk bottle and start at
1:06:20
one edge of the flume, and run it clear down to the bottom and up the other side.
1:06:27
And that was a sample.
1:06:31
So, that had to be done every three hours, at least on the rising leg of the storm.
1:06:37
Now, are you leading up to perhaps the big flood?
1:06:40
We can.
1:06:41
Okay, but you're just giving me a typical example, right?
1:06:45
Yeah, that was the thing we had to do.
1:06:46
So,
1:06:48
I'm leading up to that [1964-65 flood] . So then, I was
1:06:52
supposed to start the procedure.
1:06:56
Take the first two samples in six hours.
1:06:59
Then, Corvallis would kind of keep me informed as to weather forecasts and
1:07:05
when a storm was coming, and then, I would be responsible to get out there and
1:07:10
take the first two samples, regardless of time or day, even if it was dark.
1:07:17
And then, call the guys in Corvallis and they would come down and help.
1:07:23
So, in the case of the Christmas Flood,
1:07:27
there was this huge snowpack in the Andrews.
1:07:32
I could barely get that
1:07:36
Studebaker into the Forest.
1:07:37
So, there was a huge early snowpack?
1:07:39
Early snow, and before the rain started.
1:07:42
And we could barely get that car up to even the lower watersheds,
1:07:48
and then it began to rain.
1:07:52
So, I went out there for the first sample, and it was getting
1:07:58
really heavy [rain] up there.
1:07:59
Took the first sample, and I called the guys.
1:08:06
Then I went out to take the second sample and it had really gotten bad.
1:08:11
I began to notice that
1:08:15
the streams were really high and rushing and dirty.
1:08:19
And it was kind of scary kind of being up there in the woods because the wind was
1:08:24
blowing and it was raining everywhere.
1:08:28
It seemed like the "quiet" forest was very noisy.
1:08:31
And
1:08:33
I think we even put on hard hats, or I put on a hard hat.
1:08:38
Then Dick Fredriksen finally got there, and this was maybe 11:00 at night.
1:08:47
And I think we were after our 12:30 sample, so we went out
1:08:56
together to take the sample, and the snow was still pretty deep.
1:09:01
I think we had to walk up to Watershed 2 and get our sample.
1:09:06
And it was really beginning to get, it looked like, sounded
1:09:13
like, felt like hell, out there.
1:09:16
For some reason, there was a strong wind, so that was very noisy.
1:09:22
Then we got to the bottom and trees began to fall.
1:09:26
We could hear the trees, wham, wham!
1:09:29
And then up the canyon, you could hear, whick-shooh!
1:09:33
[Noises] Dick said it was a slide that came down.
1:09:37
And I'm still in my minus-eight lenses, even with a hard hat on.
1:09:43
My face is getting wet, my glasses are getting wet, and I'm a little scared.
1:09:49
And I think Dick is, too.
1:09:52
So, we decided we get our
1:09:56
other two samples, and we had to go to Watershed 3, and then we would stop
1:09:59
at Watershed 1 and collect a sample.
1:10:01
Were you in the Studebaker or on foot?
1:10:03
We were in the Studebaker.
1:10:03
You still were driving then, okay.
1:10:05
We could drive on the main road.
1:10:07
And we went up, parked our car a little ways away from the gauging station because
1:10:13
we didn't want to park it in the canyon.
1:10:17
Turned our lights on.
1:10:19
By this time, it's raining so hard, the flashlight hardly shines through the rain,
1:10:25
and we go up to the trail that we were supposed to go up to the gauging station.
1:10:30
There was steam and
1:10:35
rain and you couldn't see, and we stood there and looked in the canyon.
1:10:41
Then we began to make out that there was no canyon.
1:10:44
It was all mud and logs.
1:10:48
It was a debris flow basically?
1:10:49
It was a debris flow, yeah.
1:10:52
And it piled up a huge pile of logs and debris on top of
1:10:59
this, clear on top of the road.
1:11:01
I mean, all the way across the whole canyon.
1:11:05
And we thought, this is too much.
1:11:08
We'd better get the hell out of here!
1:11:10
We're in danger.
1:11:11
So, you stopped being a scientist and you started looking at survival?
1:11:14
That's right.
1:11:15
That's right.
1:11:16
So, we're going to get out of there quick.
1:11:19
So, we turned around and thought we can make our run to Watershed
1:11:22
1 and maybe get a sample there.
1:11:25
We got just down past the road to Watershed 2 and looked in the middle of
1:11:30
the road, and here's another slide right there in the road with huge, big logs.
1:11:36
And you're still in the car, though?
1:11:36
We're still in the car.
1:11:39
And there's mud in this one, and I think Dick was driving.
1:11:46
I believe he left the lights on or something and I was supposed to go
1:11:49
out and check the slide material to see if we could get through it.
1:11:55
And we couldn't.
1:11:56
It was just so deep and so wet, the mud was, that this wasn't safe.
1:12:03
And so there we were.
1:12:04
We were trapped.
1:12:05
We were trapped between Watershed 1 and Watershed 3, and the noise
1:12:13
is tremendous with these trees coming down and the earth flows.
1:12:19
We could just hear the roar, the rain was just terrible, and it was wet everyplace.
1:12:26
So, we parked the car in what we thought was a fairly safe spot and sat
1:12:33
there, then decided, we can't do this.
1:12:36
We can't stay here in this place.
1:12:38
And nobody's going to come after us.
1:12:39
There is no way.
1:12:42
So, you figured you were unsafe even in the car in that location?
1:12:46
In the car, yeah, in that car.
1:12:46
You thought maybe the hillside was going to come down on you?
1:12:48
Well, the trees maybe.
1:12:50
We were in a big old-growth stand right there.
1:12:54
Okay.
1:12:54
So, we thought, "Well, how do we get out of here? What are we going
1:12:57
to do?" We can't get across that slide down close to the road.
1:13:02
But you know, there's a whole bunch of big logs up on that
1:13:05
Watershed 3 landslide on the road.
1:13:10
And, well, maybe we can climb up on those logs and get across the slide right there.
1:13:17
And then there was another old logging bridge up where the
1:13:21
Lookout Creek swimming hole is.
1:13:24
It's not there now, but it was a log bridge that spanned
1:13:27
the whole Lookout Creek.
1:13:30
So, we decided we'd do that.
1:13:34
And we did.
1:13:35
We made it across that canyon, the log barrier in the middle of the
1:13:40
road, and got up to the Lookout Creek Bridge, and it was still there.
1:13:45
It still was up.
1:13:47
The river was just black and roaring underneath us, and big logs and
1:13:53
debris were coming down the stream.
1:13:56
So, then our plan was to cross that bridge and put us on,
1:14:03
I guess, the west side of Lookout Creek.
1:14:06
And we still had to climb a thousand feet up to the next road up on the ridgetop.
1:14:13
There's some roads there, it was a log unit in there.
1:14:18
And we thought if we get to that road, we could walk down that
1:14:21
road and walk down to the highway and maybe get a ride or get out.
1:14:29
So, we did that.
1:14:30
Started up the hill, and then, we saw that the stream, or we heard the
1:14:35
stream right next to us, just give way.
1:14:37
And it just went flying down with this tremendous roar.
1:14:43
If you've never been in an earthflow situation or streamflow,
1:14:48
it's just a thunderous roar.
1:14:52
And I'm pretty-darned scared, because this is new to me.
1:14:56
I mean, Montana was woods, but it wasn't rain like this.
1:15:00
This was really
1:15:02
-- So, you began to fear, this might be my day?
1:15:04
Yeah.
1:15:06
[Laughs] I didn't think about that.
1:15:07
How about Dick?
1:15:07
What did Dick think?
1:15:09
Dick, I think was pretty cool, and he could see.
1:15:12
I had heavy glasses on and they were steamed up and raindrops were all
1:15:18
over, even under the rain helmet.
1:15:21
So, we're marching up this hillside, and I tried to maybe go this way a
1:15:26
little bit to get around something.
1:15:28
Pretty soon, there was somebody grabbing me by the back of the neck
1:15:32
and shoulder, pulling me back, and saying, "Hey, you're just about to go
1:15:36
into a landslide!" I looked down, and finally I could see that I was headed
1:15:42
right into a very recent landslide.
1:15:46
Now, did you have the dog with you at this point?
1:15:47
No, we had nothing.
1:15:50
So, we actually made it up to the road finally.
1:15:54
And the road had downed trees on it, but we able to get under and over and
1:16:00
through them, and we made it down.
1:16:01
What time of the night was this by now?
1:16:03
Well, this is getting to be 2:00-ish, and maybe a little later than that.
1:16:09
And we made it down to the road, Lookout Creek Road.
1:16:15
[Chime] What is that?
1:16:16
Oh, the door?
1:16:19
[Break in audio]
1:16:19
Okay, we're on the road down to, on the main road, Lookout Creek Road.
1:16:24
And we did have a dog.
1:16:26
It was Dick's dog.
1:16:27
Okay.
1:16:29
We walked all the way to the highway, and then, we found out why nobody
1:16:34
could come to get us or nobody was there at all, because the McKenzie
1:16:38
River was up over the top of the highway where the Lookout Creek Road
1:16:46
enters.
1:16:47
What are we going to do?
1:16:48
Dick is six-six and strong and big.
1:16:52
He said, "I think we can wade it." So, we start to wade, and he goes first.
1:16:58
I stumble along, but behind him, pretty soon the dog comes swimming by.
1:17:05
I reached down, grabbed it by the tail and said, "Dick, we can't do this.
1:17:08
We can't make it." "Okay," he said.
1:17:11
Then he turns around, and we came back and go to the nearest
1:17:14
house up there and stayed there awhile, until 8:00 or something.
1:17:20
I'm not sure how, but I thought we could wade it or something,
1:17:25
get across it and make it home.
1:17:27
And by that time, Jack had decided to join
1:17:34
the party, and he had a heck of a time getting to Blue River, because
1:17:41
the bridge at Vida has washed out,
1:17:46
most of it, and.
1:17:47
There's this plank on the bridge and that's how we could get across there.
1:17:52
You walked over.
1:17:53
Walked over, and then we went down, or Dick went down and picked him
1:17:56
up, and I got to rest a little bit.
1:17:59
And actually, they had family from Washington that came to visit, and
1:18:03
they went down the Columbia River and all the way to the Blue River.
1:18:11
It was really a trek and I think we went, I don't know, I can't remember
1:18:17
the sequence, but we went down to help them, because they needed rescue.
1:18:21
They couldn't make it to Blue River.
1:18:23
Were there search people there?
1:18:25
Were they going to start considering sending out a search for you?
1:18:27
I don't think so.
1:18:28
No.
1:18:28
No, not yet?
1:18:29
Not at that point.
1:18:31
Yeah.
1:18:32
They were just researchers.
1:18:34
Oh, but everybody else was trying to survive this flood.
1:18:36
That's right.
1:18:37
And we had one of the people that worked in the lab that did lab work
1:18:44
for us, that were in our basement.
1:18:48
He [Fredriksen] had their birds and dogs and everything, because they
1:18:52
were flooded out of their home.
1:18:54
Then, when the relatives came, they were in the basement and the water started to
1:18:59
actually seep into the basement, which is normally very solid, leak-proof.
1:19:06
How bad was the flood in the Blue River itself?
1:19:09
Was the Blue River [the river, not the town] pretty torn up, too?
1:19:11
Everything was very torn up.
1:19:14
The whole countryside, McKenzie River.
1:19:17
The '64 flood was a region-wide event that affected our Bull Run
1:19:28
studies and our Coyote Creek studies.
1:19:30
It just tore everything up.
1:19:34
We were very lucky in the Andrews as they [logging cos.] were logging
1:19:38
up there and had equipment up there.
1:19:41
And the loggers were anxious to get into their equipment and try to save it.
1:19:46
To see how it had fared?
1:19:48
Yeah, and
1:19:50
so, they actually opened up those two slides that stopped us from getting out.
1:19:56
And so, we had access to the Andrews in a couple days.
1:20:02
What was the damage assessment to roads, but also to equipment, measuring
1:20:09
equipment, monitoring equipment?
1:20:09
Well, the Watershed
1:20:13
3 gauging station was completely lost.
1:20:16
And I think Watershed 1 and Watershed 2 actually made it through.
1:20:24
The bridge in the Upper Blue River was an island.
1:20:29
The river went around both sides of it and so you couldn't cross it.
1:20:34
You couldn't get across the creek.
1:20:36
So, how did you get into the forest then?
1:20:38
You had to walk around?
1:20:39
Actually, the loggers, had some stuff in the other side, so,
1:20:46
we got in, yeah.
1:20:47
How many of the roads in the Andrews got washed out,
1:20:53
or certain areas?
1:20:54
Yeah.
1:20:55
Or did it survive pretty well?
1:20:57
Oh, I think most of them got washed out.
1:21:01
And that took how long to rebuild that?
1:21:03
Was that Forest Service people that had to come in and rebuild that, or
1:21:06
was it the loggers helped with that?
1:21:08
Yeah, and I think it was done with emergency contracts.
1:21:12
And it was a big job.
1:21:13
It took years, I think, to get everything back to normal.
1:21:18
So, would you say that '65 was pretty much a recovery year?
1:21:23
It was, yes.
1:21:26
But you did mention that some of the stations survived, so you'd continue to
1:21:31
monitor those while you addressed the infrastructure damage around the forest?
1:21:38
Yeah.
1:21:38
And we actually did build, I think there's photographs of the work.
1:21:43
We got in pretty quickly.
1:21:44
No, no, it wasn't that way at all.
1:21:46
It wasn't pretty quickly.
1:21:49
One of the things we had, the Forest Service actually provided us
1:21:58
with dollars so that we could rent a logger and his equipment
1:22:03
to dredge out the Watershed 3 basin, and to look for the flume.
1:22:10
It was my job that first spring afterwards was to stay with the caterpillars
1:22:18
as they pushed stuff down the stream channel and into Lookout Creek.
1:22:25
And
1:22:27
I'm sure, it was 18 feet that they had to go down to find the
1:22:31
flume, the Watershed 3 flume.
1:22:33
You mean, it was covered by
1:22:37
mud and debris and
1:22:38
-? Mud and debris and stone, yeah.
1:22:41
So, it was like 18 feet above the top of the gauging station.
1:22:46
But they started just pushing this stuff, pretty much into Lookout
1:22:51
Creek, and piles and piles of logs were lined up along the stream.
1:22:58
So, yeah, it took a lot.
1:23:00
But we were able to, that summer, we rigged up a temporary stilling well
1:23:07
and gauging station on a barrel, and started recording records again.
1:23:13
What do you think the Andrews and the scientists involved with it learned
1:23:18
from that flood, and how did it change
1:23:24
monitoring science premises after that point?
1:23:30
It helped to start the change
1:23:40
what the Cascade streamflow thing is all about.
1:23:44
I think Gordon Grant told me the best example of that.
1:23:49
He said, that Oregon, the woods or the forest, is
1:23:58
"centuries of bureaucracy, but punctuated by seconds of torment." So, where
1:24:08
we thought erosion was a kind of a constant thing, we were beginning to
1:24:14
learn that that we have these seismic events that are going to do far more
1:24:20
damage than a lot of what you doing,
1:24:26
for management to remember it.
1:24:30
So that was very dramatic.
1:24:32
What other impacts did that flood, and it may be in confluence with other political
1:24:40
events or planning dynamics that happened, which changed the vector of the Andrews?
1:24:48
That flood, yeah.
1:24:51
Not that I would say very much.
1:24:56
I think at some point, I should try to tell you what the
1:25:04
general outlook was, I guess.
1:25:06
Well, that goes along with that same subject.
1:25:09
Yeah, yes.
1:25:09
Because I know people have discussed that the flood in convergence with
1:25:13
people like Jerry and Ted, and planning and what became the IBP.
1:25:19
Yeah, that's right.
1:25:19
That's what I'm saying, but I was trying to set that up for you.
1:25:22
But you can go into that however you want.
1:25:25
Yeah, okay.
1:25:25
So, why don't you go into however you want to describe it, the general
1:25:30
tenor, and where things were going.
1:25:32
Just go where you want with that.
1:25:32
The way
1:25:34
I see it, the experimental forest [H .J. Andrews] at that time was
1:25:39
still about the easiest and best way to get the logs off the land.
1:25:46
We would go up on the ridge tops and look, and there were Doug-fir forests wherever
1:25:53
you could, everyplace you could see.
1:25:55
And the impression was that there is no way you're ever going to cut these.
1:26:00
It's just so much stuff there.
1:26:04
The logging operation was just about getting the trees off the hillside, and
1:26:12
the Forest Service wanted to use the value of the trees to build the roads to their
1:26:22
points where they thought they could control fires.
1:26:26
And so, it was logging, it was just so much logging.
1:26:30
We lived in [Blue River] , and right next to us was a couple of scalers, and
1:26:35
I remember one of them saying one day, "Okay, I'll take three-log loads and you
1:26:41
take the one-log loads today, and then we'll switch tomorrow." So, there was
1:26:49
50-100 logging trucks at least a day, coming out of Blue River
1:26:56
[watershed] that were just single-log loads and three-log loads.
1:27:02
And that's all there was.
1:27:05
Almost all old growth?
1:27:07
That was it, yeah.
1:27:08
And so,
1:27:11
that was the way to do it.
1:27:13
And our science was related to how much disturbance the logging, different
1:27:19
logging operations created, and looking for alternative logging methods.
1:27:26
That's why the Wyssen skyline system [Swiss] was adopted when they were
1:27:28
looking for alternative logging methods.
1:27:28
That is why the Wyssen skyline system was there, because it would
1:27:31
be a cheaper, more convenient way.
1:27:34
And I guess, Jack was really, he knew about the mid-slope roads and
1:27:40
how they would cause so much erosion
1:27:43
when they, so much more chance of
1:27:45
-- In other words, the Wyssen using a high ridgeline road, and then
1:27:50
you can pull the logs up from?
1:27:52
No, you would actually let them down.
1:27:54
Oh, let them down.
1:27:55
Excuse me, right.
1:27:56
You could let them down that whole mile.
1:27:57
So, to lower roads.
1:27:58
Okay.
1:28:00
That would be a lot less disturbance.
1:28:02
And the roads, I think, was one thing that came out of this, was that roads cause
1:28:09
the disturbance, mostly to the streams.
1:28:11
At
1:28:14
this time, what was the science, and people like Jerry and Ted
1:28:19
and you, everybody, what was the thought about which method was the
1:28:25
best, just in terms of logging.
1:28:31
Well, I think it was looking at different methods.
1:28:35
Still, it was just clear-cut logging units and the way they had said.
1:28:41
And a lot of it was Jerry's, I think, as his master's degree
1:28:46
was on how to regenerate the forest in a more efficient way.
1:28:52
But at that point, I think it was still about getting the logs out.
1:28:57
Now, a little bit later on, I think Jerry and Ted, and I have to go into Ted's
1:29:04
role in this thing, too, Jerry came up with a comment, "You know, I don't think
1:29:13
the old growth is going to last." And I think it was during this period when
1:29:19
he began to seriously think about the 100-year rotation and how the upper slopes
1:29:27
cannot sustain that level of cutting.
1:29:31
You're talking about 100-year rotation being too short?
1:29:35
Yes.
1:29:35
Right.
1:29:36
Okay.
1:29:36
And we're going to run out of logs.
1:29:38
We're going to overcut.
1:29:42
And when he meant upper slope, he meant that the upper slopes
1:29:45
-- The upper slopes.
1:29:45
-- would be slower regenerating because the growth cycle was longer?
1:29:52
Yes, right.
1:29:52
It took longer to produce a tree and 100 years wasn't going to do it.
1:29:58
What do you remember about the slopes that were logged before you got
1:30:01
there, but also when you were there.
1:30:04
How was the regeneration process that you recall in the first, let's say, four
1:30:08
or five years you were at the Andrews?
1:30:12
As far as I know,
1:30:18
I guess, the good slopes got regenerated pretty well.
1:30:23
Was it natural regeneration or were they planting?
1:30:26
No, it was planted.
1:30:26
It was planted, yeah.
1:30:26
They were planting, okay.
1:30:26
[Various methods in early years at HJA]
1:30:27
. But I think there was a big study on
1:30:32
the west side of Blue River Reservoir because that was a burn area, and
1:30:38
there was a lot of erosion and no regeneration in that piece of ground.
1:30:48
What else would you like to talk about in this early phase that you were there?
1:30:54
Regarding Ted Dyrness, you talked about Ted when talking about other things.
1:30:54
Do you want to talk about the other people, or about Ted?
1:30:55
Yeah,
1:31:01
I would like to talk about Ted.
1:31:03
And are we still on the machine?
1:31:07
We're still on.
1:31:08
Okay.
1:31:08
Unless this is flashing, we're on.
1:31:10
That's why I keep checking it, though.
1:31:11
Okay.
1:31:13
Ted Dyrness was another special guy.
1:31:17
He was the first scientist to establish vegetation plots in an area that was
1:31:25
going to be logged, and then log it and follow the regeneration afterwards.
1:31:34
I think his studies on Watershed 1, 2 and 3 were unique because of that
1:31:41
point.
1:31:42
He went in and established the plots before they did the logging.
1:31:49
Watershed 3 was logged like it was supposed to be in 1963, and
1:31:56
completely logged and burned.
1:31:59
They burned the slash after the logs were cut.
1:32:00
Right?
1:32:00
Burn the slash after logging, and then we went in, although I wasn't a part of
1:32:06
the establishment of the original plots.
1:32:11
But, what a job to go in and reestablish those plots at
1:32:15
the same place that they were.
1:32:18
It was even worse in Watershed 1.
1:32:21
A lot more debris and the slash fire on the watershed was horrendous, and to go
1:32:30
back into those six transects, and, it was so black and so hot and so miserable,
1:32:39
that I think we started at 4:00 in the morning and worked until noon, and
1:32:43
then just got the hell out of there.
1:32:46
But to go back and try to reestablish the transects and the plots that were every
1:32:51
100 feet, they had done pretty well by putting tags on stumps and orange paint
1:32:59
and everything, but we had to dig and prod and look, and it seemed almost impossible.
1:33:06
But we found most of those plots and reestablished them.
1:33:13
Then we began a re-measurement program, to continue year-after-year.
1:33:15
And those are still being measured today, correct?
1:33:19
And they're still being measured today.
1:33:19
And that would be 50 years, right?
1:33:21
It would be 50 years.
1:33:23
More than that, I think.
1:33:25
Fifty-one, yeah.
1:33:27
Yeah.
1:33:28
And I went back and visited some of those plots and I just couldn't
1:33:31
believe it that they had grown so much.
1:33:34
When's the last time that you visited some of these?
1:33:36
Actually, I went back with some people after the last LTER meeting.
1:33:40
We went up and measured one of the plots and I couldn't even recognize it.
1:33:48
Whoever took it over did it.
1:33:49
So how big are the trees and the brush now?
1:33:52
Big?
1:33:52
Yeah, the trees are big.
1:33:56
You can hardly put your arm around the big trees.
1:33:59
And then the brush and the undergrowth is very severe.
1:34:03
But those years were very special, going back through that tremendous hot
1:34:11
burn and reestablishing vegetation, and following the plants as they
1:34:15
emerged, and the fire weed, and finally, the Ceanothus, coming in.
1:34:20
And I spent a lot, a lot of time with Fred or Ted there, and
1:34:26
established a very good relationship along with the other three people.
1:34:31
They treated me like family.
1:34:35
What did the old-school forestry people think of what you were doing?
1:34:41
You were out there five years before you moved into Corvallis, I believe, right,
1:34:46
during that first phase?
1:34:47
[Long work history at Andrews Forest.]
1:34:47
Yeah, I'm not sure it was that many, that long.
1:34:51
Maybe four or five, yeah.
1:34:53
No, three or four.
1:34:55
But the old-school foresters, the get-out-the-cut guys,
1:34:59
how did they look at what you
1:35:03
were doing?
1:35:03
Well, I don't know that I know that much about it.
1:35:09
Okay.
1:35:10
Now, when did this synergy between Ted and Jerry, when did that start to develop?
1:35:17
It was quite a bit after
1:35:22
this Watershed 1 work.
1:35:24
I think they still worked pretty well when I, I'm thinking that's where Ted and
1:35:32
Jerry really started to do the plots, the long-term measurement plots,
1:35:39
the reference stands and the soils.
1:35:42
And so, the synergy, I guess, it was started before that.
1:35:46
I mean, what became the synergy and the work that actually turned into The
1:35:51
Vegetation of Oregon and Washington, their famous book that's still a
1:35:56
benchmark book for that subject?
1:35:57
It was a little bit before; this happened a little bit before that.
1:36:01
Who else was out there in those early years?
1:36:04
Eric Forsman was a grad student.
1:36:08
He was in there in the '60s?
1:36:09
[Actually started NSO work in 1970s.]
1:36:10
He was pretty close in the '60s, yeah.
1:36:12
Okay.
1:36:13
As a grad student.
1:36:15
What do you remember about Eric?
1:36:17
And of course, for the record, Eric is the person that made the [Northern]
1:36:21
Spotted Owl, the "spotted owl."
1:36:24
Real, yeah.
1:36:25
And all of his progeny, intellectual, academic and otherwise, have taken
1:36:32
what he did originally and continued.
1:36:34
What do you remember about Eric?
1:36:35
I don't remember a lot.
1:36:37
He was there as a grad student, he would show up, and we'd kind
1:36:40
of watch over him a little bit.
1:36:43
But he was pretty much doing his thing, and grad students
1:36:47
didn't get a lot of attention.
1:36:48
We had to work.
1:36:50
Right, they were just there.
1:36:51
I got you.
1:36:52
They were there.
1:36:56
Okay, I think at this point
1:37:00
-- Want to go to your schooling now?
1:37:02
Yeah.
1:37:03
I'm going to switch a little bit here.
1:37:04
Okay, because you came back to Corvallis and got your degree.
1:37:07
Correct?
1:37:08
So I'm in this beautiful place, the Blue River place.
1:37:12
And it's just beautiful for me.
1:37:16
But then I began to hear a rumor that a scientist from the Bull Run Watershed
1:37:23
was leaving, and the scientist from the South Umpqua watershed was leaving.
1:37:30
Jack [Rothacher] was going to maintain those programs by
1:37:34
himself, and he was going to hire another technician to do that.
1:37:42
So, he would need a person in Corvallis.
1:37:47
When that happened,
1:37:50
you know, they offered me the job first.
1:37:53
I thought long and hard about it because I was where I wanted to be.
1:37:59
But then, the thought of going to Corvallis, to get the chance to go
1:38:04
to school, it's was going to be great.
1:38:07
I can't pass up this opportunity.
1:38:11
So, I accepted that position.
1:38:13
And then shortly after that, we had to have a replacement for the Andrews.
1:38:18
So we got Ross Mersereau, who is a fisheries biologist.
1:38:23
He had a
1:38:26
big family; nine kids.
1:38:29
And so, the ranger,
1:38:35
Mike, Michael?
1:38:36
Mike Kerrick.
1:38:37
Kerrick was the ranger at that district.
1:38:40
He had nine kids.
1:38:41
So, the two, these two houses that I've explained that were
1:38:45
side-by-side, had 18 kids.
1:38:48
So, each family had a football team?
1:38:52
That's right.
1:38:53
[Laughter]
1:38:53
Well, counting the parents.
1:38:57
That's eleven per side.
1:39:01
So this was all taking place, and my job was to kind of watch over
1:39:04
Ross and make sure that he was trained and learning to do his thing.
1:39:10
Dick was doing his graduate stuff.
1:39:14
So, I came to Corvallis.
1:39:16
And then it was a big job.
1:39:19
It was one week up to the Bull Run watershed, one week up there,
1:39:24
and the next week was down to the South Umpqua Experimental Forest.
1:39:28
Coyote [Creek] and Fox [Creek] ? [South Umpqua and Bull Run.]
1:39:28
And Dick in the meantime had established his proportional water
1:39:34
sampler, which was a work of art.
1:39:39
I mean, he, himself, designed the electronics and set it up so that
1:39:44
it was a proportional sampler.
1:39:48
So, if 1,000 gallons of water went down the stream, he would collect
1:39:53
one gallon or one-tenth of a gallon.
1:39:56
So, you analyzed that for all the nutrients, multiply it by 1,000, and
1:40:00
you'd know what went down the stream.
1:40:04
He developed these, and we put them on the Andrews watersheds.
1:40:08
We also put them on the Bull Run watersheds, and we put them
1:40:11
on the South Umpqua watersheds.
1:40:13
Of course, at Bull Run it was Fox Creek.
1:40:17
Correct?
1:40:17
Fox Creek.
1:40:18
And Coyote Creek at South Umpqua.
1:40:21
Correct?
1:40:21
South Umpqua, Coyote Creek, yes.
1:40:26
That required a lot more work.
1:40:27
I mean, it took two batteries to run that establishment, or run that system, for
1:40:34
three weeks, and then a five-gallon jug for samples, over and over and over again.
1:40:40
So you had to keep revisiting, changing batteries and changing bottles?
1:40:44
Collecting the samples.
1:40:45
Right.
1:40:46
So, my job then for a long time, or for a while, was
1:40:52
up at the Bull Run watersheds, down at the Andrews, and then
1:40:55
down at the South Umpqua.
1:40:59
And trying to keep up, and then extra projects we'd help Ross with.
1:41:04
There was a lot of work.
1:41:05
This was also the start of the LTER program.
1:41:09
You mean the IBP?
1:41:10
IBP, yeah.
1:41:11
Which is the predecessor of the LTER.
1:41:14
That's right.
1:41:14
Conceptually-related, but institutionally different.
1:41:17
Institutionally, yes.
1:41:18
All right.
1:41:20
And that's when we started having people from the university all over the place.
1:41:27
I mean, they were studying and looking at everything.
1:41:31
And Dick's
1:41:35
main project was the instrumentation, he was going to do a quick four or five-year
1:41:42
study on the nutrient flow from a clear-cut watershed and a model watershed,
1:41:52
and that was 9 and 10 [experimental watersheds] . So, that was instrumented
1:41:57
with kind of a temporary system.
1:42:03
The IBP program started and they wanted to use that program [-] for
1:42:09
Dick's watersheds, the experimental watersheds [-] for other activities.
1:42:17
Dick had to actually put off his study four or five years.
1:42:25
We had to rebuild the gauging stations so that they would be more
1:42:29
permanent, while the IBP continued.
1:42:31
And this is in all three watersheds, or just at
1:42:34
-- ? This was just 9 and 10.
1:42:35
Just the Andrews.
1:42:36
Just 9 and 10.
1:42:37
I mean, what I'm saying, not including Bull Run and South Umpqua,
1:42:42
just the watershed at the Andrews.
1:42:45
Correct?
1:42:45
Just in those, yes.
1:42:45
That's right.
1:42:48
So, he was really put on hold for a long time.
1:42:52
But he [Fredriksen] was very agreeable to the IBP program.
1:42:57
Now, you're going to school at the same time, correct?
1:43:00
No, it was impossible for me to go to school.
1:43:03
Okay.
1:43:04
There's too much work.
1:43:06
I couldn't.
1:43:08
I was gone all the time.
1:43:10
So, at this point I decided, this is not doing me any good, I'm not
1:43:15
getting anything that I wanted out of this, although I enjoyed
1:43:19
the work and I enjoyed the people.
1:43:21
So, I decided to look for another job.
1:43:23
And I found one.
1:43:24
This was in Boise, Idaho.
1:43:26
They were looking for a research technician to monitor the growth
1:43:32
of trees in the nursery, the forest nursery where they raised trees.
1:43:37
So, I applied for it, and I got it.
1:43:41
So, then I had to come back and tell the people here, Ted and Jack and Dick,
1:43:48
that I had a promotion and another job.
1:43:52
A new job with a promotion.
1:43:57
And, my gosh, they said, "Well, let us think, let's think about that for
1:44:02
a while." So, they didn't say much, and I left and they left, and I think
1:44:06
maybe a day or two later, they called me back into the office and said,
1:44:14
"We will see that you get your promotion out of this, and you'll be the same staff.
1:44:19
We'll make sure that that happens.
1:44:23
We'll give you a year off to finish your school at Oregon State, and we'll
1:44:30
take care of your field job while you go to school." I couldn't believe that.
1:44:35
Where does that happen?
1:44:38
So, I wind up in class and here's Jack Rothacher, the project leader of the
1:44:45
hydrology program of PNW, going down to Andrews doing technician work.
1:44:55
So, Jack did your job essentially so you could go to school?
1:44:58
That's right.
1:45:00
You owe a lot to Jack then?
1:45:02
I owe a lot, yeah.
1:45:02
I owe a lot to all those guys.
1:45:04
Yeah.
1:45:05
So much.
1:45:07
I don't know, that doesn't happen anymore, I don't think.
1:45:12
No, things a little more rigid today, I would think.
1:45:14
Yeah.
1:45:15
So, you go to school, you take your classes and you come out with a degree in?
1:45:21
Well, you know, doing the Blue River place, I'm thinking forestry is probably
1:45:27
not going to be the best thing for me.
1:45:29
And I'm in love with the river and the water and the watershed stuff,
1:45:34
and I have a connection there.
1:45:36
I'm going to be a fisheries biologist.
1:45:39
And I start on that program, and the people, the professors,
1:45:43
some of them are working at the Andrews now, the fisheries people.
1:45:47
They said, you've already got a better job than you're going
1:45:50
to get with a fisheries degree.
1:45:54
So, just get in and get a general, get a degree.
1:45:59
Get a degree in general biology and get out of there.
1:46:03
Because I already had a very good job.
1:46:07
And that's what I did.
1:46:08
And I think I made it in that year's time.
1:46:13
So, I got a degree.
1:46:15
So, the Andrews during this time is changing?
1:46:19
Oh, drastically.
1:46:20
Dramatically, and IBP is starting to come online, and academics from
1:46:26
various disciplines are involved.
1:46:29
Everybody is getting into it.
1:46:30
Start tracking and tell me about that process and what you saw, and how
1:46:33
that changed the research program, and the whole thing at the Andrews?
1:46:38
Yeah.
1:46:40
Everything changed.
1:46:41
It was not about logs anymore.
1:46:43
It was, in fact, it was getting to the point where Jerry was saying, this
1:46:49
present management system is not working.
1:46:52
We're
1:46:54
going to have to change stuff.
1:46:59
Then all the people are in there and they're starting to look
1:47:03
into the tops of the trees.
1:47:05
And there's two, I think, sophomore girls that are into the study of
1:47:14
mosses and things in the trees.
1:47:17
And they get their boyfriends to rig the trees, so that they
1:47:20
could get up into the canopy, rig it with rock-climbing equipment.
1:47:26
It's just all kinds of stuff going on very fast.
1:47:29
And this is making a tremendous demand on our resources.
1:47:33
You know, if people want to use the labs, and I haven't talked
1:47:39
very much about the chemical.
1:47:41
Are you talking about the labs here in Corvallis or up in
1:47:41
-? The lab
1:47:46
-- Because didn't you just have this little field lab up there?
1:47:48
No, I'm trying to talk about the nutrient process that Dick developed
1:47:55
to get to measure the very low quantities of nitrogen that are
1:48:00
in the streams at the Andrews.
1:48:03
Okay.
1:48:03
And so more people need this, they're using that all the time.
1:48:06
And, you know, the data is coming in faster and faster.
1:48:09
And I think Jack is by now retired, and Logan Norris is the project leader.
1:48:18
So, the project has expanded, and taken on the pesticide work
1:48:23
that Logan was involved with.
1:48:24
And of course, Logan is a lab guy, a chemist, right?
1:48:27
He's a chemist, yes.
1:48:28
But he's also a forester.
1:48:29
All right.
1:48:30
And he is a very far-sighted person.
1:48:34
I hope you get some good information on him.
1:48:37
But he's
1:48:42
running the show now [then] , and he's very forward-looking.
1:48:48
All of a sudden, I'm in a position that knows a little bit about what's
1:48:53
going on with the watershed program.
1:48:56
Pretty soon, he comes to me and says, "Al, you need a data person to help us
1:49:01
maintain the data in the project and all, a streamflow person." So, I went
1:49:06
around, and wham, I found Don Henshaw.
1:49:09
And boy, I hired him right as fast as possible.
1:49:14
And was Don Henshaw an OSU student?
1:49:16
Don Henshaw was an OSU student in statistics, and he was working
1:49:20
part-time with the etymology people.
1:49:23
But boy, was he happy to get a full-time job.
1:49:27
And then the lab started producing more and more samples.
1:49:32
And there's a problem at the lab, they can't handle it all.
1:49:34
And pretty soon, Logan Norris is coming over, "Al, would you
1:49:39
take over the leadership of the lab and maintain that?" And
1:49:46
it just keeps getting bigger.
1:49:47
Then the building at the Andrews is going in and they need a Forest Service
1:49:53
representative to oversee the experimental part, to converse with the architects and
1:50:04
contractors on the Forest Service side.
1:50:08
That had been done more by state people, and they asked, "Al,
1:50:12
would you watch over that?"
1:50:14
You're talking about the beginning of the infrastructure, like, they
1:50:19
eventually put a warehouse and then, eventually trailers, right?
1:50:25
Other gauging stations.
1:50:25
Yeah.
1:50:26
Now, isn't that in the same general area that the campus is now?
1:50:30
Or was it lower down back then?
1:50:32
Yes, there were, that particular site
1:50:37
where the campus is now that was just a log unit.
1:50:41
And there were a bunch of culverts in there.
1:50:43
Right.
1:50:44
I think Art McKee was instrumental in getting that set up to go over in there.
1:50:49
And I think people were apprehensive about making that much of a move.
1:50:56
What if budget things go down and we all have to move out of there?
1:51:01
I think Jerry was even a little bit hesitant to build that much
1:51:05
of an infrastructure there.
1:51:07
But that's the old infrastructure?
1:51:10
Yeah, this was just trailers.
1:51:13
It was surplus trailers from the ranger station in
1:51:23
-- can't recall it right now.
1:51:24
So it varied.
1:51:26
But
1:51:28
now
1:51:29
-- So it, that's where we kind of got the "ghetto-in-the-meadow" thing.
1:51:32
Was it electrified?
1:51:33
Yes.
1:51:33
Did they actually have, they had lines in there?
1:51:37
They put lines in.
1:51:41
I think Art was gone when they actually scraped the ground
1:51:45
to make the trailer spots.
1:51:48
And so, they didn't do a very good job of that, compacting
1:51:53
the soil a lot.
1:51:56
Then we got the trailers in there, and it was fine until we had the first snowfall,
1:52:00
and then the roofs began to fall in.
1:52:04
Everything started to leak.
1:52:05
And so, they required more and more Forest Service help.
1:52:09
Now, you were still living in Corvallis, though, right?
1:52:11
Yeah.
1:52:11
You were just visiting up there.
1:52:13
Yeah.
1:52:13
How many people were actually, how and when did permanent staff
1:52:18
start staying on the Andrews, approximately what year, do you recall?
1:52:25
Well, Ross was there and Art McKee was there.
1:52:29
And then there was one other technician, and that was
1:52:35
'66 maybe, something like that.
1:52:38
And so they were actually on the Forest, or were they still down at
1:52:41
Blue River [the town] at that time?
1:52:42
No, they were at the Blue River, yeah.
1:52:44
It was quite a while before they actually moved up to the Forest.
1:52:47
So it was 10 or 12 years, late '70s, before there was actually something
1:52:53
built in the meadow, in what became the ghetto-in-the-meadow, the
1:52:57
trailers, or even early '80s perhaps?
1:53:00
I think, yeah, as far as office facilities.
1:53:09
We've segued off of it, but you were going to tell me a little earlier about
1:53:13
the Army Corps of Engineers snow cabin?
1:53:17
Yes, okay.
1:53:17
And we didn't really talk about that.
1:53:19
So, I want to return to that, so we don't forget about that.
1:53:21
Okay.
1:53:24
Oh, we are on?
1:53:24
We're on.
1:53:25
We're on.
1:53:26
Okay, the U.S.G.S. had three or four snow study sites.
1:53:34
One of them is on the
1:53:37
famous pass in California.
1:53:41
This was the northwest one.
1:53:43
Tioga Pass?
1:53:46
No.
1:53:46
Donner Pass
1:53:46
Donner Pass, yeah.
1:53:48
Okay, in that area.
1:53:49
Right.
1:53:50
And this was the Northwest study.
1:53:54
And there were no roads into the site from the Andrews, the Blue River drainage.
1:54:01
So, the access to their study site was from Santiam Pass.
1:54:07
And there was actually a trail that was built down to that, and
1:54:12
they accessed that by horseback.
1:54:15
They went to
1:54:18
the forks of the Blue River drainage, which is Wolf Creek, Command
1:54:24
Creek and I think, Blue River.
1:54:27
We built gauging stations there and they built a cabin that
1:54:31
you could actually live in.
1:54:34
It was built with logs and split cedar siding.
1:54:39
Then they came way down river eight miles, I think, from the cabin, and
1:54:45
built a little survival shed, four or
1:54:51
five miles above the Blue River, present Blue River bridge.
1:54:55
So, there is a cabin there.
1:54:58
And they were there for quite a while, for as long as their study was.
1:55:04
But they didn't get a lot of information from that study because the conditions,
1:55:09
they just had to make a living.
1:55:11
It was so harsh in that environment.
1:55:14
Was that set up basically so they knew what the Blue River watershed was giving
1:55:19
them below because they had built a dam?
1:55:23
No, the dams were nowhere.
1:55:25
There were no roads and no dams at that time [snow program started in
1:55:27
1950s, Blue River Dam built in 1968]
1:55:27
. Oh, okay.
1:55:28
So, they were already out of there when I got to the Andrews.
1:55:36
But the cabins were still there?
1:55:37
The cabins were still there and there was a gauging station there.
1:55:41
If you look at the watershed numbering system, I got to number the watersheds.
1:55:46
We have 1, 2, 3, and then there's 4, and not very many people know where 4 is.
1:55:53
Four is Blue River.
1:55:54
It's the old gauging station for the Corps of Engineers.
1:55:58
So, 4 is Blue River?
1:55:59
Uh-huh [affirmative]
1:56:01
. So, were these cabins used for anything by you guys?
1:56:05
Yes.
1:56:07
We decided to maintain those stations.
1:56:10
Oh, okay.
1:56:10
So we would go into, just the lower Blue River station, because we thought
1:56:16
that would be a comparable watershed for the Lookout Creek drainage.
1:56:23
We did go in and maintain a gauging station there.
1:56:26
And I think, maybe after the '64 flood, I think that station,
1:56:36
we tried to rebuild it after the '64 flood, but it was basically destroyed
1:56:40
and the record wasn't very good.
1:56:44
So, after that I think it was pretty much destroyed.
1:56:47
Are those cabins still there today?
1:56:49
Parts of the cabins are still there.
1:56:51
I don't think there is
1:56:56
anybody that knows where that lower one is anymore.
1:57:01
I tried to take people in and show them that.
1:57:03
And I went back, the cabin was there.
1:57:06
Somebody else had found it and redid it a little bit, but
1:57:10
yeah, I think it's still there.
1:57:12
Now, there was at one time a cabin on Mack Creek, right?
1:57:17
Yes, there were several survival cabins, I guess, in the forest.
1:57:23
Kind stuck amongst these
1:57:24
-- There was one still one up by Watersheds 6, 7 and 8, because that's a very
1:57:30
dangerous spot to go to in the wintertime.
1:57:32
You could get stranded.
1:57:34
So, there's still a survival cabin up there?
1:57:37
Yeah, and I think that there was one,
1:57:44
one farther up at one of the reference stands.
1:57:50
Now, you're not talking about the structures that are around some
1:57:53
of the weather stations, right?
1:57:54
No.
1:57:55
Because you could use those as survival cabins, also.
1:57:57
You can now, yeah.
1:57:58
Right.
1:58:00
And then there was one at Mack Creek.
1:58:02
And what was that?
1:58:04
Just a survival cabin, a backup shelter, if you will?
1:58:07
That's right.
1:58:08
Well, it didn't have a scientific reason?
1:58:11
No, it was just purely a survival shelter.
1:58:14
Now, were there any situations where things got dicey with you
1:58:19
or any of the other people or grad students, really in your whole time
1:58:23
that you were at the Andrews, where these were necessary and used?
1:58:28
They were used, but mainly for research purposes.
1:58:32
Hydrology students would use the one at 6, 7 and 8, and spend weeks at a time there.
1:58:41
But we never really had to use them as a survival shelter.
1:58:55
How would you describe the Lookout Creek watershed
1:59:00
to somebody that's never been there?
1:59:04
Wow.
1:59:07
[Laughs] It's just a gorgeous piece of real estate with
1:59:14
clear flowing streams, huge trees,
1:59:22
just a magnificent place.
1:59:24
I take people there all the time.
1:59:27
I think most of my family have some of my photographs in their front room.
1:59:33
And I take people back to special spots and show them what a
1:59:40
real old-growth forest is like.
1:59:42
And
1:59:45
so, that's how I would explain it.
1:59:49
How and when did your photography start to become an ascetic exercise
1:59:56
and not just a scientific exercise?
1:59:59
Yes, it's kind of interesting.
2:00:03
The work ethic was very strong when I first started.
2:00:07
And, so you didn't have time to take pictures.
2:00:10
You had time to take pictures, but just for the job.
2:00:14
So, that's it.
2:00:14
Yeah, that was it.
2:00:15
Pictures for just the job.
2:00:17
And
2:00:20
so, very few researchers really take the time to take pictures
2:00:24
because it takes a while.
2:00:26
You know, you have to go to take pictures.
2:00:29
And then I began to realize that people were asking me for my photos
2:00:34
and they were asking me to take photos.
2:00:37
Then the work with my brother
2:00:41
inspired me to do more photo work.
2:00:45
And then I began to realize that probably my legacy in the Andrews is going to be
2:00:50
pictures, not anything else particularly.
2:00:53
I didn't do anything really different than anybody else.
2:00:57
But I tried to write some papers and with Jack's help, and I wrote one on the
2:01:03
water temperature and maybe a few others.
2:01:06
And then scientists got real,
2:01:12
to help me out, put my name on a lot of research papers.
2:01:15
But I said, you know, my camera work is going to be the thing
2:01:19
that's going to stand out for my contribution to the Andrews.
2:01:22
Do you remember
2:01:25
when you started to think that way?
2:01:27
Well, it was when I had more time.
2:01:31
You know, other people were, you know, we had a crew, and Don Henshaw went
2:01:36
around and we had more watershed people.
2:01:40
And I had more of a supervisory role.
2:01:44
That's when I started to have more time to get in and take pictures.
2:01:48
And then I would take time to make special trips for photography work.
2:01:54
And I have quite a collection, private collection, that was
2:01:57
taken, pictures that were taken
2:02:02
not during work hours.
2:02:04
And I'm not quite sure what to do with those yet.
2:02:06
I think probably I'll wind up donating them to the Andrews.
2:02:17
Now, when and how did you begin to feel an attachment to the Andrews, first
2:02:20
as a natural place, and later to its human community, culture and activities?
2:02:29
Well, first of all, I felt a natural
2:02:37
belonging to the Andrews when I first started work, and I was with this
2:02:41
special family that took care of us.
2:02:49
But then I think as far as, you know, I didn't have much of an education.
2:02:54
It's like I didn't understand the science, but I kept working and going
2:02:59
to the LTER meetings and other meetings
2:03:03
that were occurring.
2:03:04
I tried to attend almost everything I could.
2:03:08
And then, I gradually began to see the science and understand it, and
2:03:14
think, well, that's a possibility, and that's good, and see how I can
2:03:19
contribute to that phase of it.
2:03:22
But for me, it's been a real learning experience, and a real eye-opener
2:03:28
to what a forest really can be.
2:03:32
What were some of the realizations that you learned about the science that
2:03:37
were particularly impactful to you?
2:03:40
The big one that I've talked about before is that, you know, the
2:03:44
cutting plan is not going to be, the old-growth forest is disappearing.
2:03:49
You're going back to Jerry Franklin's point correct?
2:03:50
Yes.
2:03:51
And that was the big turning point for me.
2:03:54
That was really what it was all about.
2:03:56
And then the fact that the old-growth ecosystem is far different from
2:04:04
a young forest, and it's a whole different ecosystem and community.
2:04:09
And so that's really when I began to change my ideas.
2:04:19
How do you feel about the place today?
2:04:22
I mean, looking back through the lens of fifty years?
2:04:27
You know, attachment to place, love of place, how do you feel about it today?
2:04:34
You know, I still, have a real fondness for it and the people.
2:04:39
The people treat me very well, also, and I want to contribute as much as I can.
2:04:46
I'd like to go back as much as I can.
2:04:51
So, I feel attached to it just as much as ever, I think, and maybe more now.
2:04:57
And I'm very interested in this new social program.
2:05:01
I'm worried that it's going to take away from some of the basic research that
2:05:07
we've always been proud of keeping going.
2:05:12
But, I really would like to see the social aspect
2:05:20
advance so that more or less the common everyday person
2:05:25
viewed the Andrews as we do.
2:05:27
Now, when you mean social, you mean outreach and education?
2:05:31
Outreach and education.
2:05:34
Because you know, it's such a small percentage of people that really
2:05:40
understand or know what the Andrews is.
2:05:43
Or, for that matter, any other similar research facility or site?
2:05:49
I suppose that's right, yeah.
2:05:50
That's probably true pretty much anywhere you go.
2:05:53
And the Andrews is one of the more high-profile ones that you will find.
2:05:55
That's right.
2:05:57
And probably one of the ones that's made a greater impact on public policy issues
2:06:04
that people would identify with if they ever understood the origin of the science.
2:06:08
That's right, yeah, yeah.
2:06:11
And that's true.
2:06:12
I think the Andrews is very good at that level, but I think there's
2:06:16
something there for everybody that I wish, I hope that we can get out.
2:06:20
Now, you do photography and
2:06:25
how would you describe the products that you're producing now, with
2:06:28
your photography cards and postcards and things like that, right?
2:06:31
[Product line of photo-cards.]
2:06:32
Yeah.
2:06:37
I enjoy doing it.
2:06:39
But
2:06:43
it's hard to justify doing it because there's such a small number of people
2:06:50
that are really interested in that.
2:06:51
But some of your images are from the Andrews is my point.
2:06:55
All of them, yeah.
2:06:56
All of them.
2:06:57
And so, I'm going off on the point you made earlier about outreach.
2:07:03
In a small way, that could be said as your way of continuing outreach through your
2:07:08
love of photography and love of the place?
2:07:12
That's' right.
2:07:12
Yeah, that's true.
2:07:15
Now,
2:07:18
how would you describe the evolution of the research program from the IBP
2:07:23
through the first part of the LTER?
2:07:27
That was really the meat of your career, really.
2:07:32
You retired in what year now?
2:07:35
I retired in 2000.
2:07:37
2000, yeah.
2:07:37
Fourteen years.
2:07:38
I mean, through the '70s and the '80s, even into the early '90s,
2:07:43
that's when that whole thing happened.
2:07:45
The IBP, it had its short thing and then there was the
2:07:49
transition, and then the LTERs.
2:07:52
How have you seen the research program mature at the Andrews when you were there?
2:07:58
And you can even reflect to today, 14 years after-the-fact
2:08:02
of being in your active career?
2:08:04
Well, I think we mentioned several times that when I was there it was cut
2:08:10
the trees and get them out of there.
2:08:12
And
2:08:14
that's changed.
2:08:15
I mean, really, we don't cut trees any more on the Andrews
2:08:18
unless it's necessary or
2:08:20
-- What I'm saying, as the program became much more sophisticated and you had
2:08:26
many more different disciplinary tracks, you know, even the U.S.G.S.
2:08:30
put in their flume later on.
2:08:31
You have all these different things.
2:08:33
How did that change your job in terms of what you did?
2:08:38
I think the biggest change was like you say, in the early years.
2:08:45
And I guess it changed more that I wasn't in the woods so much as I was involved
2:08:52
with the building of the site and the running of the site, and attending
2:08:56
the meetings and trying to do what
2:09:03
I can to help that aspect of it.
2:09:08
Now, if you were going to describe your career, how would
2:09:10
you describe what you did?
2:09:12
I mean,
2:09:17
you got your undergraduate, but did you ever get your master's?
2:09:20
No.
2:09:20
Okay.
2:09:21
So, how would you describe your profession and what you did?
2:09:27
Profession, I would describe it as I'm a facilitator.
2:09:30
You know, I tried to find out what's going on and help out.
2:09:36
And I guess if I have a fault, it may be a fault, is I just never say no.
2:09:42
And so I've taken on a lot of jobs that other people wouldn't do.
2:09:50
What are some of those jobs?
2:09:53
Well, when they came and asked me to do, take over lab responsibilities
2:09:59
and be the supervisor of the lab, I probably had no business doing that.
2:10:04
Because you weren't a chemist?
2:10:06
I wasn't a chemist.
2:10:06
No.
2:10:07
[Laughs]
2:10:09
But they needed an administrative, responsible person, to keep things going?
2:10:14
Yeah.
2:10:16
And what did you learn
2:10:22
out of that?
2:10:24
You know, I don't know what I learned out of that.
2:10:27
I guess it was just, yeah, you can do it.
2:10:30
It helps.
2:10:31
Now,
2:10:33
as you were at the Andrews longer, how did your job description change?
2:10:41
Oh, it changed it very much.
2:10:43
Yeah.
2:10:43
For instance, give me some ideas about the evolutions of what you did.
2:10:46
You know, you did certain hydrological watershed monitoring
2:10:50
and you did this, and you did that.
2:10:51
And how did that kind of change over time?
2:10:52
From a very simple technician level, to, wow, in the end, I was
2:11:00
managing most of the projects, the Forest Service money projects.
2:11:06
Because what I did involved the cost of running equipment, renting people,
2:11:13
getting vehicles, buying supplies.
2:11:18
So, I was pretty much, I thought, in the driver's seat for the whole program.
2:11:25
The scientists didn't have near as much money as I did.
2:11:31
So much for getting your Ph.D. Right?
2:11:36
But they had their work, which is very important to them.
2:11:40
So, how would you describe the relationship between
2:11:43
the Forest Service and OSU?
2:11:45
You know, the Andrews today, you can hold it up as being kind of a model
2:11:51
for inter-institutional cooperation.
2:11:54
But that hasn't always been that way.
2:11:56
And how would you describe that relationship and how it
2:11:59
evolved and changed over time?
2:12:00
Oh, yeah.
2:12:02
I remember my first discussion with Ranger Bob Burns [Blue River District]
2:12:07
. And he went, "Well, since you guys are research, I think I could kick you out
2:12:11
if I wanted to." And that's about it.
2:12:16
He was serious, wasn't he?
2:12:20
And then, I've seen so much improvement in the Forest Service
2:12:26
and the liaisons and people that interact with that, it's unbelievable.
2:12:33
The rangers now that come up have
2:12:37
taken what has been learned, and given back a lot of information to the
2:12:42
research people, what they ought to be looking at and where their mistakes are.
2:12:46
And it's been just a fantastic involvement.
2:12:51
Who would you say were the key people along that path from
2:12:53
the Forest Service perspective?
2:12:55
Well, John Cissel was great.
2:12:57
And then,
2:13:00
I can't remember.
2:13:00
Well,
2:13:04
Mike Kerrick was great, he was very good.
2:13:07
And then the other ranger, and I can't remember his name.
2:13:10
Steve Eubanks?
2:13:11
Yeah, yeah.
2:13:13
He was back in the '80s.
2:13:14
Yeah,
2:13:17
very strong, and many opinions.
2:13:20
And I think the research people got as much from him as we gave him.
2:13:30
Right now, I'm not sure of that, you know, I haven't followed as
2:13:36
much recently, but I don't know.
2:13:41
How did you sense differences in the community, the local community
2:13:46
around the Andrews, over time?
2:13:47
I mean, you had your period when you were in Blue River in the early days and it
2:13:52
was a relative boom period for Blue River.
2:13:55
The mills were still running.
2:13:57
You had the Cougar Dam.
2:13:59
And now it's much different.
2:14:01
How do you sense the different dynamic between the community and the Andrews?
2:14:09
I think in the old days, what I appreciated is that we used the community
2:14:14
much more than maybe the Andrews does now.
2:14:18
When we came from Corvallis, we worked in the field and then
2:14:23
went to a restaurant in town.
2:14:25
We bought gas there and participated in the community, I think a whole
2:14:31
lot more than now with the site up there where everybody kind of stays.
2:14:36
And Blue River has become very depressed, also.
2:14:38
Very depressed, yes.
2:14:42
So, you have any famous Cougar Room stories that you'd like to share?
2:14:46
I'd better not go there.
2:14:52
[Laughs]
2:14:52
Well, it doesn't have to be you.
2:14:53
You can use a pseudonym for
2:14:59
the person.
2:14:59
I can't think of anything appropriate right now.
2:15:03
Appropriate?
2:15:03
[Laughter]
2:15:07
Just a minute, I'm going to be leaving.
2:15:08
We were talking about
2:15:09
-- [Break in audio]
2:15:09
So, a story comes to mind.
2:15:11
Maybe it's how the Cougar Room got started.
2:15:15
And I guess
2:15:15
-- Is it because of the Cougar Reservoir, is that why?
2:15:18
I think that's the name of it, yes.
2:15:19
Oh, okay.
2:15:19
And it was a very popular place when they were building Cougar Reservoir.
2:15:24
Right.
2:15:25
Maybe half the people would stop there.
2:15:27
And maybe that's why we had so many accidents on the McKenzie River.
2:15:31
[Laughs] But things started to slow down.
2:15:35
Things were getting poorer.
2:15:36
And the owner, Louie,
2:15:41
thought that he would try the topless arrangement.
2:15:48
Oh, that's funny.
2:15:51
So, the Cougar Room was a topless bar for a while?
2:15:54
Yes, it was.
2:15:56
And he was, well, I have to get into the story here.
2:16:00
So, it was up for discussion.
2:16:02
And his wife said, "Louie, if you go topless, I'm leaving!"
2:16:08
And she left the next week.
2:16:14
Really?
2:16:14
So,
2:16:17
then it was a wild topless joint.
2:16:19
And for a good number of years.
2:16:23
I remember that now.
2:16:24
We would stop in all the time.
2:16:25
And then Louie got sick, died, and she came back and took over the restaurant.
2:16:32
And the tops came back on.
2:16:33
And the tops came back on.
2:16:35
Yeah.
2:16:35
And then it finally burned down a few years ago.
2:16:39
But also, there was a tragedy with that.
2:16:41
I think the grocery store,
2:16:45
daughter of the grocery store owner in Blue River and Louie's boy and some other
2:16:53
kids were out playing in winter time.
2:16:56
And somehow they found a hood of a car that was turned up
2:17:01
in the front like a sleigh.
2:17:03
And they hooked it up to the back of a pickup.
2:17:06
And Louie's son, and I don't remember his name,
2:17:11
ran over the daughter of the grocery store.
2:17:17
So, that was not a good thing that happened from that.
2:17:23
Well, that's certainly a sad story.
2:17:25
Yeah.
2:17:25
But
2:17:32
now, what were some of the most important scientific discoveries at the Andrews
2:17:36
during your tenure that you were a part of, either as an assistant or somebody
2:17:41
you were intimately working with, ones that you remember when something
2:17:45
happened and that you were a part of?
2:17:53
Boy, a lot of what we did in the early days is now coming back to being used,
2:18:00
like all the stream flow records and the stuff that Julia Jones gets out of that.
2:18:08
All the water temperatures and the old precip records, and then
2:18:12
going back and digging those old records out and making them useable.
2:18:18
And it's an important part of looking at climate change in that area.
2:18:23
And so, every year, I'm more impressed about just the
2:18:29
basic stuff that we collected.
2:18:31
This last time I went back up to the watersheds and Watershed 1, I started
2:18:37
looking at Ted Dyrness' old plots.
2:18:40
And you know, we never thought anything that would ever happen
2:18:44
like when we out there burning up in the sunshine on a bare watershed.
2:18:50
Trying to replant or count vegetation plots?
2:18:53
Trying to count the vegetation plots, yeah.
2:18:57
Just to see that information being used is just beyond
2:19:03
anything I could ever comprehend.
2:19:05
Do you remember when Mark Harmon's logging composition
2:19:10
experiment was first introduced?
2:19:12
I do.
2:19:14
And as that was implemented, what do you remember about the discussions about
2:19:18
how that was going to start and proceed?
2:19:24
I think as I remember, it was just a common start of a study.
2:19:30
And I don't think anything really much different about it.
2:19:36
There were a lot of crazy things going on in those days.
2:19:41
The 1980s was kind of the coming of age for the Andrews scientifically
2:19:46
as the LTER system established its status as a long-term research site.
2:19:53
But also, when it became more political in the sense that the science that
2:19:59
was coming out of the Andrews played a very central role in how the lands
2:20:04
would be managed, even through today.
2:20:08
Do you remember when Jerry Franklin started becoming, shall we say,
2:20:12
more of a media figure, and the "New Forestry" started to be discussed?
2:20:17
Do you recall that?
2:20:19
Yes.
2:20:20
I followed Jerry very closely and really appreciate and am astonished
2:20:25
at his thought level and work, and the way he makes things happen.
2:20:30
I
2:20:33
followed it very closely and I still am very interested in this project
2:20:37
that's going on over here by Monroe, or some place at, in the Alsea watershed.
2:20:46
So, he was just unbelievable.
2:20:50
But do you remember the role of the Andrews changing in the sense that there
2:20:57
seemed to be a media story about the Andrews in the late '80s and early '90s,
2:21:02
every week, something about old growth or New Forestry or the spotted owls?
2:21:09
I mean, do you recall that change?
2:21:10
Not a lot, I don't.
2:21:12
I don't recall too much of that.
2:21:15
Now, Eric Forsman, you saw him as a graduate student?
2:21:19
I did.
2:21:22
Are you surprised that his spotted owl work became what it became?
2:21:29
I think everybody was very surprised, yes.
2:21:33
Yeah, Eric.
2:21:37
I got to go with the crew quite a bit to mark spotted owls.
2:21:43
And I know Rita [owl researcher] very well.
2:21:47
So, yeah, I'm very much aware of that.
2:21:50
I get closer to the spotted owls than most people do.
2:21:53
And how would you, just tell me some stories about your knowledge
2:21:58
of that, even going out with these teams today or recently?
2:22:03
Let's see.
2:22:07
Actually, Rita calls me up and says, "Come along. I've got a couple babies
2:22:12
out here. We're going to go tag them and you can take pictures of them."
2:22:17
So, you've done a lot of the photography of the spotted owl with them?
2:22:20
Yeah.
2:22:21
Now, was that true back in the earlier days when the study was
2:22:26
becoming what it became, even before Dwyer's ruling about spotted owls?
2:22:31
No.
2:22:32
I didn't have much contact with it then.
2:22:37
But I did get the grandkids out, three out.
2:22:40
And it was unbelievable.
2:22:41
Really?
2:22:42
To see a spotted owl.
2:22:43
And it came down, they put a mouse on the log right between the two girls.
2:22:49
And she came down, got that right between those girls.
2:22:53
And it was quite a thrilling experience.
2:23:01
Tell me about the lead-up from the first facilities at the location
2:23:06
where the campus exists today, the old trailers, the "ghetto-in-the-meadow," to
2:23:13
what became the campus of today?
2:23:17
Tell me about that evolution and what you know about that.
2:23:25
I got pretty involved with that when it changed from a state [OSU] level project.
2:23:36
Art McKee maybe, and Terry Cryer, were basically building the buildings and
2:23:45
doing the job, to a point where the Forest Service was more particular about what
2:23:51
was going on and started to step in.
2:23:55
Then, we had to have a Forest Service representative and I became that person.
2:24:01
I don't think I was popular all the time due to how things were done in the past.
2:24:06
And this is the transition from the '80s to the new campus that was
2:24:10
started in the early '90s, correct?
2:24:10
Yes.
2:24:11
And
2:24:15
remember, I was deeply involved with the kitchen and the
2:24:18
kitchen dining room project.
2:24:21
Of the new facility or old?
2:24:22
New facility.
2:24:24
And that was, I think.
2:24:25
Okay, that's the McRae Building, right?
2:24:27
Yeah, it's the McRae Building.
2:24:28
Yeah.
2:24:30
Okay.
2:24:32
There was money that the architect, who, I should know that name really
2:24:41
quick, but got money to do this project.
2:24:45
He hired one of his architects to design the building.
2:24:49
It was a woman, a Forest Service person, I think, very good.
2:24:57
We went through all the steps of trying to pick out what we wanted and what
2:25:01
would be the best design for the place, and it was pretty fancy, the design.
2:25:09
But as time went on, she didn't meet her schedule, spending money
2:25:15
and it's getting late, and so finally, we had to call her on it.
2:25:24
Then she hurried up with her design and they put it out for bid, and
2:25:30
from what she thought was going to be within our budget was about twice
2:25:35
what we had in our account budget.
2:25:40
So, what are we going to do?
2:25:42
The money's going to run out pretty quick.
2:25:45
So the architect, Mark Anderson, a great person and very responsible, he
2:25:54
kind of stepped in, took over, went to different contractors in Eugene,
2:26:00
and you probably don't know the name of the contract he selected, but he
2:26:06
got a "design-build" contract finally, at the last spur-of-the-moment.
2:26:12
He came up and saw what we wanted, we presented what we thought
2:26:18
we needed, and he built that.
2:26:21
What was the order of construction with the new campus?
2:26:24
What was the first, do you remember the order of it?
2:26:30
I think it was, well, the first building on the place was a Forest Service
2:26:34
garage that was over there by the
2:26:37
-- The weather station?
2:26:38
-- the weather station, yeah.
2:26:41
And that's a gray barn now or something.
2:26:44
Then I believe, the trailers came in.
2:26:48
We actually did the trailers for some of the office work,
2:26:52
and I think Art was there.
2:26:53
And then the shop, I think, was the next big thing.
2:26:59
In the back where Terry Cryer is now?
2:27:00
Yeah, where Terry Cryer is.
2:27:03
And that was done
2:27:06
pretty much to Art and Terry's discretion.
2:27:09
I'm not sure how we got away from it now, away with it but, and then
2:27:17
it was McRae Creek, I think, the apartment house.
2:27:20
And that's where we started to get into trouble with the Forest Service.
2:27:24
They wanted more control over what was being constructed, and then,
2:27:30
I was deeply involved with the new office where it stands today.
2:27:37
That also involved the conversion of
2:27:41
the dining hall and conference room in back.
2:27:46
And then the other apartments, well,
2:27:55
Rainbow was, I think, the last one.
2:28:00
If I recall, the funding basically came from political connections
2:28:06
to move it to the next level.
2:28:06
That's right.
2:28:10
Les AuCoin [Oregon Congressman] , I believe, had a lot to do with it?
2:28:13
Now I don't know about that.
2:28:13
I don't know too much about that.
2:28:17
Now, tell me some humorous or otherwise stories about the ghetto-in-the-meadow.
2:28:23
[Laughter] I mean, I've heard different stories, but you
2:28:27
would know as much as anybody.
2:28:29
Tell me some good ones.
2:28:32
I can tell you about a gal that we hired for the summer.
2:28:39
She was from the South.
2:28:42
And she wanted to work in the woods and she was hired for a lab job, but she
2:28:47
wanted to definitely be in the woods.
2:28:50
But she was not prepared for the woods.
2:28:55
And she had a very small bladder, so she had to go, we had to stop
2:29:00
for her to go to the bathroom.
2:29:01
Every five minutes?
2:29:02
Every five minutes.
2:29:04
[Laughs] One day, one trip we made to the Andrews, she was just bursting
2:29:11
at the seams and jumped out of the car, ran into our old trailer
2:29:16
shack and went into the bathroom.
2:29:19
And all of a sudden, she just came back, just screaming and yelling,
2:29:23
and there was a rat in the toilet!
2:29:27
[Laughter]
2:29:28
In the toilet?
2:29:28
In the toilet.
2:29:30
Had probably been there for a week.
2:29:33
And so that's the first thing that really sticks out, but yeah, there's
2:29:40
a lot of stories about floors caving in and roofs caving in.
2:29:43
If there's one in particular, do you have an accurate version of
2:29:48
the caving in of the floor story?
2:29:49
No, I don't think so.
2:29:51
I've heard about taking a shower, different
2:29:56
versions of it.
2:29:56
Yeah.
2:29:58
But, so it wasn't just a matter of sanitation, but it was also safety, right?
2:30:03
Yes, it was safety.
2:30:04
And these were old GSA trailers from, they were transferred around.
2:30:07
GSAs came from the Oakridge Ranger Station.
2:30:09
And you just happened to get them after they'd been used?
2:30:11
They were surplus, yeah.
2:30:13
Surplus?
2:30:13
They were trying to get rid of them, so they brought them up to the Andrews.
2:30:16
We had no idea that, when the snow hit, came down on them, if
2:30:20
the roofs were going to cave in.
2:30:22
That's when we built the fancy trailer shelters.
2:30:25
Now, the Salt Salmon is the one remaining trailer shelter, correct?
2:30:29
Yes.
2:30:30
And there was a trailer under there.
2:30:31
There were like three or four of those, weren't there at
2:30:33
one time, under the shelters?
2:30:34
That's right, yeah.
2:30:35
On some of the bigger ones, there were three or four.
2:30:38
And
2:30:41
the Forest Service had to fork up a lot of money and a design, which we overbuilt, I
2:30:47
think, according to most people, to build the snow structures over the trailers.
2:30:51
And we were going to tear that one down, but it, the Salt Salmon, stayed.
2:30:56
And now it's the social center?
2:30:57
It's the key place, the center, yeah.
2:30:59
It's the social center for the Andrews, your barbecues and your talks.
2:31:03
That's right.
2:31:04
So, how would you characterize the facilities now?
2:31:08
Adequate, better than adequate, fantastic?
2:31:11
How would you describe them?
2:31:13
I think they're fantastic.
2:31:19
They're probably not adequate to hold all the needs that people have for
2:31:24
them in the summer time, but we've been working and working to try to
2:31:29
get them to be used year-round more.
2:31:33
In other words, if you built too much, if you added the dorm space,
2:31:38
for instance, you'd have a lot of down-time if you had a lot more beds?
2:31:42
Yeah.
2:31:43
And that would be the cost-benefit justification?
2:31:45
The cost is going way up.
2:31:46
We had one big problem with
2:31:50
the new dining facility that we built.
2:31:52
We wanted to make that propane, because the power went out on the Andrews
2:31:59
routinely once a month, and you could be stuck with no power for days.
2:32:06
So we did.
2:32:06
We had that specified that they put a propane tank in there.
2:32:09
So, they have a propane backup then?
2:32:10
No, to heat the place and do the cooking.
2:32:13
Oh, okay.
2:32:14
Well, the cost of propane went way up, and now it's a real detriment.
2:32:20
What improvements do you think they need to make up there?
2:32:23
If they had a blank check, relatively speaking, what do you think could
2:32:28
be the next step to make that an even better first-class facility?
2:32:33
You know, I think we've got the facility.
2:32:37
We just don't have the,
2:32:41
we can't operate it year-round, so that we can pay for it.
2:32:46
Right.
2:32:47
Now, speaking of equipment, you talked about the first, when you first got
2:32:54
there, you had a Studebaker and snowshoes.
2:32:58
What do you think about the new snow-cat they just got?
2:33:00
Oh, wow!
2:33:01
Let me tell you the story about that.
2:33:04
Tell me about the old snow-cat, Al.
2:33:05
I'll tell you about the first snow-cat.
2:33:08
Oh, there's one before the one that I saw, so there's one
2:33:11
more before the one that I saw?
2:33:12
[In the Andrews facilities.]
2:33:12
There's a red one, yeah, a little red MP.
2:33:15
Oh, is there a name for that?
2:33:17
I don't remember, that's the brand that it would have been.
2:33:19
Okay.
2:33:21
So, snowmobile-snow travel was very hard in the Andrews because of our wet snow.
2:33:27
And when they first started to come up with snowmobiles, we tried
2:33:32
everything that we could find.
2:33:33
And they would not work and just would leave you stranded.
2:33:37
The snowmobiles would just sink right in, right?
2:33:39
The butt would go down and you couldn't steer it.
2:33:44
In eastern Oregon, you could go 40 miles an hour with the darn things, but in
2:33:48
the Andrews, they would just plug up.
2:33:51
Well, I had to make a trip with the very best that we could find in a snowmobile.
2:33:56
It was a Ski-Doo double-track.
2:33:59
And that was supposed to really be the machine at that time.
2:34:04
So I went, took it down with me to the Coyote Creek study.
2:34:09
It was snowy with snow on the ground, quite a bit of snow, and
2:34:14
it was rainy, kind of drizzly.
2:34:18
And I went with a person from Douglas County, who was my
2:34:22
assistant, or my partner.
2:34:25
We did our watershed check.
2:34:27
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.
2:34:29
We had one rain gauge six miles away to check, and if we didn't check
2:34:38
it that day, it would be twelve hours to wait to take that one.
2:34:42
So, okay, we're going to do it, 4:00 in the afternoon.
2:34:47
And we motor up there pretty good.
2:34:50
It goes up there pretty well, but the weather is getting cold now,
2:34:55
and so pretty soon, it's freezing.
2:34:57
And so we get up there to the top of the ridge where the Q-12 snow and rain gauge
2:35:03
is, and I park and go service the gauge.
2:35:08
And of course, it's screwed up, wouldn't work.
2:35:11
So, we're fiddling and fiddling and fiddling, and I finally get it going,
2:35:15
but, you know, an hour has passed.
2:35:18
And we come down and it's freezing now.
2:35:21
So, we need to get out of there because Burl Orr, who was the Douglas County
2:35:26
representative, an old sheep-herder, farmer and logger, and for him, wool
2:35:35
clothing is the best clothing to use.
2:35:39
Well, his wool coat was getting heavy and wet.
2:35:44
That isn't going to do very good.
2:35:45
No, it isn't going to do very good.
2:35:46
So, we're finally happy to get down there and to get to our machine, and
2:35:50
drive the 12 miles to get out of there.
2:35:52
We start the thing up, put my hand on the trigger, and it doesn't go.
2:35:58
Here we are, you know, 6:00 at night, 7:00 at night.
2:36:02
In the middle of nowhere?
2:36:03
This guy is freezing to death, right, and we're in the middle of nowhere.
2:36:09
So, I looked around, I have to do something really quick.
2:36:13
And I looked over and there's this huge, a big Forest Service sign,
2:36:18
it was a ridgetop, a main junction.
2:36:22
So, this thing is 4' x 8' or more.
2:36:26
And I remember, I keep my little pitch piece under the seat,
2:36:30
and a little hatchet in there.
2:36:33
We run over and we break that sign down and put it in the middle of the road, get
2:36:37
the pitch out, and put a match in there.
2:36:39
Pretty soon, we have this big, roaring fire.
2:36:44
We found out really what the problem was with the snowmobile, is that
2:36:49
snow had gotten into the track mechanism and froze.
2:36:54
And so there we were.
2:36:56
But we turned that thing over and put the tracks up close to the fire.
2:36:59
Oh, so you melted it out?
2:37:00
And we were melting it out,
2:37:03
and we're getting warm.
2:37:05
Ah, so you did make it out then?
2:37:07
So, we
2:37:10
get going pretty soon and it looks like we can get our sticks and chop that snow out.
2:37:16
And turned that thing over and get it going.
2:37:19
And, zoom!
2:37:21
We got halfway down the hill and it froze up again.
2:37:25
Oh, wow.
2:37:25
So, now we're talking 12:00, 11:00-12:00 at night.
2:37:31
Luckily, we came upon a logger camp that had a smudge pot
2:37:35
there for a heating system.
2:37:36
And we got that thing out in the middle of the road and went through
2:37:39
unfreezing the tracks thing again.
2:37:42
And you made it out this time?
2:37:42
We made it, at 4:00 in the morning, we got to the truck.
2:37:47
[Laughs] And the roads were just a sheet of ice.
2:37:50
And he was cold by then?
2:37:52
Nah, he was, he was tough.
2:37:53
He was getting better.
2:37:54
He was cold, but he was
2:37:56
-- And he was very nice, a real gentleman.
2:37:59
From our watershed site to Roseburg was a long ways.
2:38:05
And several people were in the ditch, and we stopped and helped them out.
2:38:08
So, we didn't get to the Roseburg until 10:00 or 12:00 that day, the next day.
2:38:15
It's a long night.
2:38:17
Well, I guess, some of the story got out, because the next year, the director
2:38:26
out of his pot [money] in Portland, the director of the PNW Station,
2:38:32
had us a new snow-cat.
2:38:34
Because those are very expensive.
2:38:35
Yes, they were $10,000 in that early time.
2:38:39
Now, do you want to tell me, a typical story of going up to the top stations
2:38:47
in the winter at the Andrews, with whatever snow-cats you had available?
2:38:52
Now?
2:38:53
Well, or when you were back active, or now, because I know
2:38:56
they have a new one up there now.
2:38:57
And then there's previous generation ones, they're backups now.
2:39:01
Anyway, a typical story?
2:39:03
Oh, they're very cool.
2:39:06
The old ones, well, the snowmobiles, just weren't dependable at all.
2:39:10
And we had to carry the water samples out and the batteries in, and, yeah.
2:39:14
You needed more storage space, too.
2:39:16
Yeah.
2:39:18
And the new ones, or the first one, was if you were sitting
2:39:22
in the front seat, it was nice.
2:39:23
But there was a big cab back there that just made a "boom" noise.
2:39:28
Fred [Swanson] tried to ride with us a couple times, and then got out
2:39:31
and walked rather than ride inside.
2:39:32
Are you talking about Fred Swanson?
2:39:36
Yeah.
2:39:37
But the new ones are just
2:39:39
-- You couldn't catch a cat-nap in the back.
2:39:41
Right?
2:39:41
Well, he's a walker, so he enjoyed that a lot more, I'm sure.
2:39:47
But the new ones are just like a Cadillac.
2:39:49
I mean, they are so good.
2:39:51
And the scenery is so good.
2:39:53
You could see so much and it's so comfortable.
2:39:55
When
2:40:02
you do it occasionally now, do you go up with John Moreau,
2:40:05
and maybe go up there with him?
2:40:06
I haven't gone for a while now, but yeah, I used to go all the time.
2:40:09
Take your camera up sometime for some winter shots?
2:40:10
Greg, I go with Greg a lot now.
2:40:13
Oh, Greg Downing?
2:40:13
Greg Downing.
2:40:14
Okay.
2:40:18
So what would be a typical monitoring trip to the high country in the
2:40:23
Andrews with the older generation snow-cats or the new ones?
2:40:27
But just describe a typical trip.
2:40:31
Wow.
2:40:33
It's so varied with the equipment that you have.
2:40:36
Oh, give me a couple variations on the theme then.
2:40:41
I can tell you one story with Ross Mersereau.
2:40:43
He got a, I want to call it a FoxTrack snow machine, which was supposed
2:40:48
to be "the machine" for back East.
2:40:51
It had a handlebar situation, a motor in the back, a track
2:40:56
underneath, and we sat in a seat.
2:41:00
We were able to get out, I think, we were able to get into the Hi-15 area.
2:41:09
And then coming out, something happened to the motor and it couldn't stand the pull.
2:41:15
So, this machine was supposed to be the best, but it just had two skis in
2:41:20
front and you just couldn't steer it.
2:41:24
So, we finally devised a method, and I guess I was kind of mean.
2:41:29
My job was to get on the back and hold the throttle open where the engine
2:41:33
was, while he tried to steer it.
2:41:36
Well, I could hold it open a lot longer than he could steer.
2:41:40
And finally, he just got tired and jumped off.
2:41:43
This is on a snowmobile, though?
2:41:44
This is on a snowmobile, yeah.
2:41:46
Oh, right, right.
2:41:48
But the snow-cats,
2:41:51
they're just so easy.
2:41:53
You just load the equipment and they'll haul almost everything you need, and
2:42:00
you just take your lunch and your coffee and go march up there.
2:42:03
Now, it is sometimes very difficult when the snow is soft, and I know
2:42:09
I've used our snow-cats in the Andrews in wet snow, and, you have
2:42:16
to sometimes back up and start again.
2:42:18
Has there ever been any accidents where you or anybody else went off
2:42:21
the roads, or the road gave way?
2:42:24
Well, there is one humorous accident, but not with a snow-cat.
2:42:30
Oh, tell me the humorous accident.
2:42:32
I'm afraid to.
2:42:34
[Laughs]
2:42:34
Oh.
2:42:36
It was with the big Ski-Doo, the one that I had trouble with.
2:42:41
Art McKee and another technician were out.
2:42:46
They got the thing stuck.
2:42:48
It's kind of 45-degrees up, nose is pointed forward, and the thing won't go.
2:42:54
They're trying everything to get it to go and get it unstuck.
2:42:57
Those are pretty heavy to lift, too.
2:42:59
Especially, the twin track.
2:43:01
Right.
2:43:02
So, finally, it got to the point where they got the engine going, and
2:43:08
the technician was in the back and he was pushing just as hard as he could.
2:43:11
Art went up and grabbed the two front skis in the front of the
2:43:16
snow machine, and he was pulling.
2:43:19
And all of a sudden, the thing gave way.
2:43:21
[Noise] Right over the top of him!
2:43:24
And down over the road and into, almost, Canyon Creek.
2:43:29
[Laughter] They didn't tell that story very often.
2:43:34
Did it total?
2:43:36
They got it back up.
2:43:37
But, was it still useable?
2:43:37
It was still useable.
2:43:38
Oh,
2:43:40
okay.
2:43:41
So, we have had no fatalities in the snow-cats.
2:43:45
How did the Hi-15 get the name Hi-15?
2:43:50
Oh.
2:43:51
That's kind of interesting.
2:43:52
It has to do with the old maps and the new maps.
2:43:56
There's a Section 15.
2:44:00
And there is two.
2:44:01
On the township and range map?
2:44:03
On the Andrews, there's two, there used to be two Section 15's.
2:44:07
There was a low Section 15 and a high Section 15.
2:44:12
So, the name got to be Hi-15, but then, when they started really looking at the
2:44:18
maps, the Hi-15 section didn't really fit.
2:44:22
But the name stayed!
2:44:25
[Laughs]
2:44:26
And thank you, that's great.
2:44:27
That's very interesting because nobody else knows that story.
2:44:31
So, basically it has to do with the section in the survey maps of,
2:44:37
basically, what was Section 15.
2:44:38
But it changed.
2:44:40
Because that was the high Section 15.
2:44:42
There's a low Section 15.
2:44:44
You mean in a different township?
2:44:46
Yeah.
2:44:47
Okay, I got you.
2:44:48
At the bottom of the Andrews.
2:44:49
And so the "high" and "low" is regarding elevation?
2:44:56
Well, that's the elevation of the one Section 15, that is, at high elevation.
2:45:01
[High and low references are primarily due to being "high" [north] or
2:45:03
"low" [south] on the grid maps.]
2:45:03
So, is there a low 15?
2:45:04
Yes, there is.
2:45:06
I believe there is.
2:45:07
So, the Hi-15 is where on the map in the Andrews, exactly?
2:45:12
It's in the Lookout Creek or McRae Creek watershed?
2:45:16
It's in the McRae Creek watershed.
2:45:17
That's what I thought, right.
2:45:18
Okay.
2:45:18
So, it's kind of on
2:45:20
the north, the northwest corner, right?
2:45:24
[Of the H.J. Andrews EF lands.]
2:45:24
Northwest corner, yeah.
2:45:24
Right, okay, got you.
2:45:26
I really wanted to know that.
2:45:27
I did not know that.
2:45:29
[Break in audio]
2:45:30
Now, compared to when you started at the Andrews to what you know
2:45:33
now, what's your perspective of
2:45:40
experimental forests, research natural areas, and long-term ecological research?
2:45:47
How do you view that, and has your view evolved in that 50-year period of time?
2:45:55
Yes, well, I think we've discussed that.
2:45:59
For me, or the Forest Service and the research, it was just all about
2:46:03
getting the logs out of the woods, building roads, doing it as safe as
2:46:07
possible, and harvesting the trees and getting new trees to restart.
2:46:13
Then, as I go through the process, I'm beginning to find out that there's another
2:46:18
ecosystem in the old-growth forest.
2:46:20
And that there's so many aspects to the research that can be done and how the
2:46:26
nitrogen is fixed and carbon is stored.
2:46:29
And
2:46:32
the succession and the plots and the wind movements up and down and canyons.
2:46:39
It just is amazing, and I try to keep up as much as I can
2:46:44
by going to the LTER meetings.
2:46:48
But, it just isn't even the same place
2:46:54
I saw in the early days.
2:46:57
So, you really understand the role of ecosystem science today?
2:47:02
No, I don't understand it, and I don't know that any of us, understand it.
2:47:05
Oh, okay.
2:47:07
Because I don't think we're really smart enough to manage the Earth.
2:47:10
I just think we're going to try, but something's going to come up
2:47:17
and it just isn't going to happen.
2:47:19
But I think we should try.
2:47:22
So, these are admirable goals or admirable activities, however
2:47:27
limited our knowledge is, even with all the science that goes on?
2:47:31
Yeah.
2:47:32
And I don't think we're smart enough.
2:47:36
[Chuckles]
2:47:36
What do you think the role of interdisciplinarity has had at the
2:47:41
Andrews, and how that has improved what they do, and complicated what they do?
2:47:50
Interdisciplinary studies?
2:47:52
Just everything.
2:47:53
Just the whole matrix of the whole program?
2:47:57
Yeah.
2:48:02
I think it's fantastic, very hard to accomplish to keep everybody's interest
2:48:07
and not step on somebody's toes.
2:48:09
Yes.
2:48:29
What do you think could be improved at the Andrews from today?
2:48:39
Well, the obvious things in looking at the finances, I would like to see somehow,
2:48:47
some way to make use of the facilities in the wintertime.
2:48:53
And then with science, you know, I think we're doing pretty darn well.
2:49:00
About that, we need more funding for that, also, but to see the
2:49:06
bunch of people that get together.
2:49:09
In the old days, it seems like scientists almost guarded their work.
2:49:13
They didn't let it out to near as many people.
2:49:17
But to see these people giving all their science and their ideas, and
2:49:25
working together to accomplish a larger picture, is just something that just
2:49:31
didn't used to happen, as I saw it.
2:49:33
And I think it's a great thing.
2:49:36
Just wonderful.
2:49:37
Yeah,
2:49:40
the idea of a collaborative, interdisciplinary research site
2:49:46
goes against the individualistic spirit that a lot of academic
2:49:52
scientists traditionally practiced.
2:49:56
Yeah.
2:49:56
You know, and so you're correct on that.
2:50:07
Now, in your view, what are the most important impacts of scientific findings
2:50:14
on forest management and policy?
2:50:17
Specifically, that came out of the Andrews, things that you know
2:50:20
happened that impacted things, in the area here that you live
2:50:32
in?
2:50:32
Well, I keep going back to this ecosystem that we discovered
2:50:38
in the old- growth forest.
2:50:40
And
2:50:43
how that affects the way people operate, the way the Forest Service
2:50:49
operates, the way the loggers operate, and the way people live.
2:50:56
I'd look for that to continue, and I think there is more work to be
2:51:01
done on that to provide ecosystems
2:51:07
where deer and elk and
2:51:10
spotted owls and people can exist.
2:51:15
If you were going to look at the different watersheds, I mean, you were there at
2:51:19
the beginning when some of these places either had just been cut or were going
2:51:22
to be cut, if you look at the different, the patchworks of all these different
2:51:28
stages, describe a few of those things, just things that you think about today
2:51:33
when you go up and say, wow, the watershed looks like this or this looks like that.
2:51:39
Oh, yeah.
2:51:39
I mean, give me a couple examples that you always think about when you
2:51:44
go back because you do go back a lot.
2:51:46
I think maybe Watershed 1 is a very, very good example of what I can see.
2:51:53
Because I got to see that when it was still partially old-growth trees.
2:51:59
And then I saw the cutting and the logging, and then the burning of that.
2:52:07
And then it was back to a virtual desert.
2:52:10
It was just black and hot and nothing.
2:52:14
And then, it just continues to grow and people started using
2:52:20
it as a research site again.
2:52:22
And now,
2:52:24
the trees are almost big enough to harvest one more time.
2:52:28
So, to see that whole cycle take effect, is
2:52:33
just amazing to me.
2:52:38
Did you ever feel a tinge of guilt about clear-cutting those areas, or
2:52:45
did you at that time have a different perspective as a young person, realizing
2:52:51
it was part of science, or people just cut trees because it's the forest?
2:52:55
I mean, did you ever have a weird sense, of what are we doing here?
2:53:00
What are we doing here?
2:53:00
Yeah.
2:53:02
Well, yeah, I thought for a while there, I could see where the mistakes
2:53:09
were, where we were just going in and cutting stuff, just to get a road.
2:53:15
And we're building roads in the wrong spot.
2:53:18
Are you talking about in the Andrews or in the forest in general?
2:53:20
In the Andrews, and in the forest.
2:53:22
And then,
2:53:29
the fish habitat was big for me.
2:53:31
You could see how poor management was affecting the aquatic ecosystem.
2:53:39
And
2:53:42
so I could see that we're really making some progress.
2:53:46
But at the same time,
2:53:49
we need the cut area, not necessarily the cut, but the burned area where
2:53:55
Douglas-fir and elk and deer and the early succession creatures and plants can grow.
2:54:05
So, that's the next step, to provide that total ecosystem,
2:54:13
so that man can manage that, and get the whole picture and not just part of it.
2:54:20
You can't protect just the old-growth forest or the aquatic
2:54:25
system, but also get the early succession in, work that in also.
2:54:30
Do you think that the pendulum swing has gone back a little too far to the
2:54:33
other side to where now it's almost impossible to cut on the forests?
2:54:36
Yeah, maybe.
2:54:40
But I'm glad to hear that Jerry's working more on that and trying to proceed.
2:54:46
What's the biggest trout you ever caught in Lookout Creek?
2:54:49
Hey, did you even know that Lookout Creek is closed to fishing?
2:54:54
Well, now, but not
2:54:55
-- Yeah, but you're right, it was not closed.
2:54:57
-- not then.
2:54:57
No, I'm asking you an old...I'm throwing you off your game here.
2:55:01
I'm giving you a totally different question.
2:55:03
[Laughs] But no, you told me about fishing, and I'm asking you.
2:55:07
Maybe an 18 to 20-inch trout.
2:55:10
In lower Lookout Creek?
2:55:12
In lower Lookout Creek.
2:55:13
And you know, they love to stay under that bridge.
2:55:16
I don't know if you know where the swimming hole is right
2:55:18
up the road from Watershed 3.
2:55:21
There's a narrow pull-off there and a bridge there.
2:55:25
That's the bridge that we crossed over Christmas [flood story] . You
2:55:27
could go there and look down and you could see these big trout like this.
2:55:31
Were they rainbows or brook or
2:55:33
-- ? They were rainbows.
2:55:35
And yeah,
2:55:37
I could see them.
2:55:38
And at night in the evenings, we would, Ted, Dick, and Dick, particularly, was a
2:55:44
very good fisherman, and very dedicated.
2:55:47
We would go down and catch fish out of there.
2:55:49
And I think Ross and I were instrumental in suggesting that
2:55:55
that may close, that I think we should close that stream to fishing.
2:56:00
Now, how far up would the fish go in the early days when it was permitted?
2:56:05
Well, I think if you wanted to go up and catch the little cutthroat trout,
2:56:10
which was really fun to do, and they're very energetic and they hop out of the
2:56:15
water after your fly, and it's very fun.
2:56:18
I like to catch them with a barbless hook and throw them back.
2:56:25
That's where I do all my fishing now.
2:56:28
Do you have -- oh, go on, sorry.
2:56:29
But, yeah,
2:56:32
I like to do that.
2:56:34
And we go up as far as practical, I guess.
2:56:37
Were there any fish up in Mack Creek, or is that too steep?
2:56:41
We didn't fish there, but I do fish with sticks and pieces of lunch
2:56:46
meat in the lower hole down there.
2:56:49
And if you haven't found that, you ought to find that spot.
2:56:52
It's very beautiful.
2:56:52
Kind of that swimming hole on Lookout Creek, you mean?
2:56:57
Yeah, the swimming hole.
2:56:57
We used to stop there all the time, and there are photographs of Dick and Jack and
2:57:07
Ted and I sitting there by the stream.
2:57:09
And actually throwing a little bit of fish.
2:57:13
If you're there for 15 or 20 minutes and are perfectly quiet, you'll
2:57:18
be surprised at the big fish that come out and start showing around.
2:57:23
But it takes, actually about 20 minutes to settle it down.
2:57:27
Yeah, because they'll see there's humans up there, right?
2:57:28
Because they know who's up there.
2:57:31
They're well-trained by Darwin and evolution.
2:57:33
Right?
2:57:33
That's right.
2:57:34
[Laughter]
2:57:35
The concepts, I should say.
2:57:38
You haven't told me about the skinny-dipping stories.
2:57:42
The skinny-dipping stories?
2:57:43
Oh, my gosh!
2:57:44
[Laughter]
2:57:45
You didn't talk about those.
2:57:47
And we're at the end here, but I've got to bring that up
2:57:50
because I've heard different variations.
2:57:52
Well,
2:57:55
I guess I was raised at a point where you had to feel pretty embarrassed
2:57:59
without a swimming suit on.
2:58:01
But right after the LTER group started, swimming suits were kind
2:58:07
of verboten, and you really felt out of place if you had a swimming suit.
2:58:15
So, the river was just lined with, and the swimming holes, were just, at
2:58:21
5:00 the people would be in the water.
2:58:22
This was the team, the people that were
2:58:27
working there, right?
2:58:27
Yeah.
2:58:28
And there were other people, yeah.
2:58:31
And this is even co-educational?
2:58:33
Yeah, oh, yeah.
2:58:35
And it was routine.
2:58:36
Hail to feminism.
2:58:37
And Jerry Franklin got some complaints from the local people.
2:58:45
The Blue River people?
2:58:47
The Blue River people.
2:58:47
What were they doing up there?
2:58:50
Yeah.
2:58:50
[Laughs]
2:58:50
I thought you said they were separate from you guys?
2:58:53
That's right.
2:58:54
But they were there, and they complained.
2:58:56
And so, Jerry had to get up in the middle of the LTER meeting and say, "Okay, I know
2:59:04
you guys swim naked in the stream, but we can't do that anymore. We've had some
2:59:10
complaints and they just don't want to see that." And maybe the Forest Service
2:59:14
was part of that, but we just don't want to see that in the streams anymore.
2:59:19
So, that pretty much settled that.
2:59:23
Okay.
2:59:23
But we still would go in the private pools after work, especially on
2:59:28
a really hard job and take a dip.
2:59:31
What was your typical way of unwinding?
2:59:33
A six-pack of beer,
2:59:38
or a Coke or whatever if you're a non-drinker?
2:59:41
Yeah,
2:59:44
for me, I think it was just nice to get home and get off your feet.
2:59:48
Yeah, because you lived in Corvallis by this time.
2:59:50
Yeah, I was a lot of the time in Corvallis.
2:59:52
So, you had a lot of drive time.
2:59:53
I had some drive time.
2:59:54
I stayed overnight quite a bit.
2:59:56
But yeah, have a beer on the front porch.
3:00:08
How do you think that your photography and how that's changed your life, affected
3:00:12
your view of the Andrews and what it does, and how you describe or define beauty?
3:00:18
You know,
3:00:22
as far as the Andrews is concerned, it's a very, very difficult place
3:00:27
to characterize with a camera.
3:00:31
Old-growth trees, old-growth forest, you know, if there's sunshine in through
3:00:37
the leaves or through the shadows on the ground, it's very, very hard to expose to
3:00:45
capture it correctly.
3:00:47
But I'm always looking at ways to improve my photography to better
3:00:54
characterize an old-growth forest.
3:00:57
And to include downed material and snags, and things that really
3:01:05
represent a real old-growth forest.
3:01:07
The messiness and the chaos of an old-growth forest?
3:01:09
Yeah, that's right, and to put it in order into a photograph and not have a log
3:01:14
right through the middle of your picture.
3:01:16
It needs to lead into the picture.
3:01:20
What would be your favorite kind of lens to shoot an old-growth forest?
3:01:23
Well, you know, I
3:01:26
started out with really a normal lens, and then I went to wide-angle lenses because
3:01:31
I thought would take care of that problem.
3:01:35
But it just shrinks the size of your picture so much.
3:01:38
I've tried getting really close to
3:01:45
a big tree and put that in, you know, perspective as to the hugeness
3:01:50
of the tree, and let the wide-angle lens take in the small portion of the
3:01:56
picture to get the rest of the forest.
3:01:59
So, it doesn't work.
3:02:02
And some people have said they, to put a person in there so that
3:02:05
you can see what the scale is.
3:02:07
But I don't think that's a picture for me.
3:02:13
So, what you're saying is the complexity and the size of the old-growth forest
3:02:18
reveals the limitations of photography?
3:02:21
That's right.
3:02:21
And the height of the trees makes it's very hard to get some
3:02:29
stems and tops in the picture.
3:02:32
And I'm working now with HDR where you have several exposures and you
3:02:38
can combine those into a picture.
3:02:42
Like a panorama type picture or
3:02:44
-? HDR is taking three pictures at different exposures.
3:02:48
And printing them on top.
3:02:48
Okay, got you.
3:02:49
And working with the, yeah,
3:02:54
because an eye can only see like five, or an eye can see about 17 stops or 18 stops.
3:03:01
And a camera only sees five.
3:03:04
So, by taking pictures that are overexposed and underexposed and normal
3:03:11
exposure, and piling those together, then it has some real opportunities.
3:03:19
In other words, bracketing your picture?
3:03:21
That's right.
3:03:21
With the three, okay.
3:03:22
With the three.
3:03:23
And they call that HDR now.
3:03:25
That's with the digital though.
3:03:26
In the old days, they called it bracketing.
3:03:28
Bracketing, that's true.
3:03:29
In the old film cameras, right.
3:03:33
Now, there are likely some items not discussed in this interview.
3:03:36
Can you think of anything that we have not covered that you would like to address?
3:03:40
You know, I can't.
3:03:40
It's been a long interview for me.
3:03:43
And I was thinking about some things but
3:03:47
-- Is there any lasting memory or something you would want to say about
3:03:50
a relationship or just something that perhaps we haven't talked about?
3:03:56
No, I think, I think we've covered a lot.
3:04:00
Okay.
3:04:01
We're over the magic three-hour limit, so I want to thank you for taking your time.
3:04:06
Thank you, Al.
3:04:07
Oh, you're welcome.
3:04:08
Thank you, Sam.
3:04:09
That was quite an experience to do this interview.
3:04:13
I appreciate your time.
3:04:14
So, thank you.
3:04:15
I'm signing off.
3:04:17
[Break in audio]
3:04:17
One last story.
3:04:19
This is addendum to the Al
3:04:23
Levno interview.
3:04:24
He had one more story he wants to add for the record.
3:04:27
One more story.
3:04:28
And it's about Watershed 1.
3:04:30
When we were in Watershed 1 in the early days, Ted Dyrness and I discovered
3:04:36
that a large part of the erosion that was occurring in the watershed
3:04:41
was due to human footsteps and deer footsteps that caused a dry rabble.
3:04:47
And it was really piling up and going down into the stream.
3:04:53
On the banks around the streams, right?
3:04:56
Yes, but up on the steep hills.
3:04:58
When you went across that steep hill, you would cause a dry rabble and it would when
3:05:04
we were up there, we could even see dust
3:05:08
or where small particles
3:05:12
of earth were falling down into the watershed.
3:05:16
And so, the more Ted thought about that, the more he thought he would like
3:05:21
to get some kind of a number on that.
3:05:24
And we talked with Jack, who was always very good at coming up with
3:05:29
some way to take care of a problem.
3:05:33
He developed a plywood box, half a box, actually.
3:05:40
And it was a 4' x 8' piece of plywood that was cut in half, and then it
3:05:44
had 2' x 4' sides and fence posts.
3:05:48
Then we would set that up on the slope, and then, we had a plastic or rubber apron
3:05:56
that we could staple into the ground.
3:05:58
And then, that box would collect dry rabble as it came down the slope.
3:06:04
So, they set up the study and they put it on different slopes and different aspects.
3:06:09
And we proceeded to do, to carry out that study.
3:06:14
But in order to do that, you had to get the boxes into the watershed.
3:06:19
So, Jack was very strong and I was pretty good.
3:06:27
But Ted was a little bit, he didn't quite have the physique, I guess.
3:06:32
A little thinner, he was a little thinner?
3:06:33
Not a little thinner, but a little more clumsy, I guess, maybe.
3:06:37
Okay.
3:06:37
He just wasn't quite as adept.
3:06:40
So, we'd gotten several of these boxes installed in the top and they
3:06:45
were doing pretty well, but we needed some boxes down toward the bottom.
3:06:51
And of course, you don't want to carry those things uphill.
3:06:55
Because you put them on a pack-board and it's eight-foot wide and
3:07:00
two-foot high, and you've got two boards plus two fence posts.
3:07:05
And you've got to carry those things down the hill and get it to your location.
3:07:11
So, we decided, one last push.
3:07:13
We would take three boxes, start at the top and carry them more than halfway
3:07:20
down, three-quarters of the way down.
3:07:24
And we were exhausted by the time we got to close to where we would be.
3:07:30
Finally, Jack was leading the group, and he was by far the strongest person, and
3:07:37
he was starting to put his pack down.
3:07:40
And I made it myself somehow.
3:07:43
But Ted stopped on a steep rock slope, and for some reason, he lost his footing
3:07:50
and went tumbling head-over-heels down the hill, maybe 30 feet down the watershed.
3:08:01
Then this box was rolling over the top of him and the fenceposts
3:08:05
were falling out, and I was really afraid for him, and concerned.
3:08:11
But he kind of came up
3:08:16
on his knee or on his butt, looked around, shook his head, we
3:08:20
put the boxes in and went home.
3:08:24
It was a very close call, and we probably shouldn't have done it.
3:08:28
Was it only a semi-humorous moment later?
3:08:32
Yes.
3:08:33
Yes, when you used to say, you remember that time?
3:08:33
Yeah, I remember that time.
3:08:36
That is it.
3:08:36
That's one of those.
3:08:38
[Laughs]
3:08:38
The time when you revealed to us that you were not a mountain goat.
3:08:42
Right?
3:08:43
Yeah.
3:08:45
[Laughs]
3:08:46
That's wonderful.
3:08:48
The safety record of the Andrews has been excellent.
3:08:51
Nobody's ever died in the Andrews.
3:08:51
Correct?
3:08:51
As far as I know, nobody's ever died in
3:08:57
the Andrews.
3:08:57
Yeah.
3:08:57
And then, it's also had very few car accidents.
3:09:02
I think I had one of the most major car accidents.
3:09:06
You, personally?
3:09:06
Yeah.
3:09:07
And it was unbelievable.
3:09:08
What happened?
3:09:09
With my wife and
3:09:13
daughter.
3:09:13
We were up at Mack Creek on a vacation type trip into the forest at Mack Creek.
3:09:19
And we decided we were coming out, and maybe I got a little carried away on the
3:09:25
speed that I was supposed to be doing.
3:09:26
We were in a little Dodge pickup.
3:09:29
And nobody had their seatbelt on.
3:09:31
And we came around that hairpin curve right at, before you down the steep hill?
3:09:39
And just before we got to the curve, here comes the Forest Service truck.
3:09:43
He was in the middle of the road and he was coming right at us.
3:09:48
And the only thing I could do was step on the brakes.
3:09:53
And maybe that was the wrong thing to do, but that's what I did.
3:09:56
And we went to the edge of the road and we teetered at a 45-degree angle.
3:10:03
And I looked and said, "We're going to go, we're going to go, we're going
3:10:06
to go over." And then, "No, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not." "Oh,
3:10:11
yes, we are." And we flipped twice.
3:10:16
And Vicky, Barb's daughter, just about went out the window.
3:10:20
But Barb reached over and grabbed her.
3:10:22
And she might have got crushed by the truck.
3:10:24
She would have gotten crushed.
3:10:26
The Forest Service rig was very good.
3:10:28
They hopped right out and helped us up on the road.
3:10:31
But it was, you know, hours.
3:10:34
How interesting.
3:10:36
You saved these two scary stories for the very end.
3:10:40
I mean, wow!
3:10:43
But there have been a couple of broken ankles or broken legs, right?
3:10:45
[In the H.J. Andrews as a whole.]
3:10:46
I don't know that.
3:10:47
I believe there's at least one that I know about.
3:10:49
But I mean, my point is, a remarkable safety record.
3:10:53
Very, it is, yes.
3:10:54
Considering the incredible amount of activity and the number of people from
3:10:58
professionals to grad students, to
3:11:00
-- And the lack of knowledge of the actual, the grad student or the college
3:11:05
person, for driving on the road.
3:11:07
Gravel roads are like driving a car on a bed of marbles, really,
3:11:11
and you don't have the control that you have on the city street.
3:11:15
And people don't really realize that until you
3:11:22
put on the brakes.
3:11:23
I know what I forgot to ask you.
3:11:25
Do you have a favorite place in the Andrews?
3:11:28
Oh, yeah.
3:11:29
It's in Reference Stand 8.
3:11:31
And I think there's lots of pictures there.
3:11:37
Where is this?
3:11:39
Describe the place and why you love it?
3:11:46
It's an old-growth forest.
3:11:48
I think it's a true fir and Douglas-fir mix.
3:11:53
And it's right on Lookout Creek, on upper Lookout Creek right close to
3:11:57
where one of the reference stands is.
3:12:02
And beautiful forest and beautiful stream, just four or
3:12:10
five feet wide and maybe waist deep in the deepest part.
3:12:16
And just flowing over rocks, just a beautiful place.
3:12:21
I try to take my family up there as much as I can.
3:12:25
And I have pictures that I've given to the family, and I kind of insist
3:12:29
that they go to see that spot.
3:12:33
Now, that's a wonderful way to finish
3:12:35
-- Oh, okay.
3:12:36
Ending interview number two.
