00:01
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State
00:04
University College of Forestry.
00:07
I am here in the home of Kelly Burnett, Aquatic Ecologist/Fish
00:13
Biologist, long-term United States Forest Service researcher, and
00:18
former OSU Courtesy Faculty.
00:20
We are going to be doing an oral history interview that is centered
00:25
on Northwest Forest Plan, but not limited to her involvement in that.
00:30
It will also include biographical elements of her whole career, and
00:34
it’s part of the Northwest Forest Plan Oral History Project Phase II.
00:39
And so, I want to thank you, Kelly, for being willing to spend the time
00:43
with me here in your home today to talk about this important subject.
00:47
Well, you're welcome, and thank you for having me as
00:51
part of this research project.
00:54
Well, it's one of the most influential, impactful and I think, novel land
01:00
management document, and process [NWFP] , at least in U.S. history
01:05
certainly, so it's worthy of that.
01:07
So, we will start off with your basic biographical question,
01:10
where were you born and raised?
01:12
And just kind of take me where you want to take me from there.
01:16
I was born in Atlanta, Georgia.
01:19
Grew up in northwest Georgia.
01:22
Went to undergraduate at Berry College, a small liberal arts school
01:27
in the hills of northwest Georgia.
01:32
I got a degree in biology and chemistry, a dual major.
01:39
Then, from there, worked at Emory University for a year in genetics,
01:45
and decided I wanted to move out West.
01:49
I had done a field course through the University of California
01:54
at Santa Cruz, in Montana, and just fell in love with the West.
01:59
I
02:02
was working with a guy who had come out to Oregon
02:10
to try out for the 1980 Olympics in track.
02:12
He was a big birder.
02:13
His name was Jeff Jefferson, and he told me they had burrowing owls in Oregon.
02:19
I thought that was pretty cool, so I decided to apply for graduate school
02:22
out here in chemical engineering.
02:28
At Oregon State?
02:29
[Olympic Trials-in Eugene at U. of Oregon.]
02:29
At Oregon State I was accepted into the chemical engineering master’s
02:30
program, but had to take a bunch of undergraduate courses because I
02:37
didn't have an engineering background.
02:39
My interest in that, knowing very little about engineering, was
02:49
a commitment to environmental protection and water quality
02:55
that I developed back East.
03:13
I thought chemical engineering would be the way to go, but
03:15
quickly realized it was not.
03:21
You didn't like all those chemistry classes?
03:23
No, the chemistry classes were great because I had done
03:25
that as an undergraduate.
03:26
Okay.
03:26
But the engineering classes, statics, dynamics and electrical
03:30
engineering fundamentals, and all the undergraduate engineering classes I
03:35
had to take to get to the point where I could enter the graduate program;
03:43
my heart wasn't in it.
03:44
It just wasn't fun.
03:47
I looked for another graduate program and ended up in fisheries, bringing together
03:54
my biology and interest in water quality.
03:59
I
04:02
had the good fortune and funding to work with Charles Warren and Bill Liss
04:10
on a project looking at the effects of a toxicant on different organizational
04:19
characteristics of ecosystems, and how the effects differed based on the structure
04:25
and organization of the ecosystem.
04:28
What was the toxicant?
04:30
Dieldrin.
04:32
It had been banned for widespread use, but as an organochlorine insecticide,
04:35
people knew it was a serious toxicant that could produce an environmental effect.
04:40
And there was an established LD-50 for it.
04:43
But in this study we used a level well below any
04:50
acute lethal limit.
04:50
With long-term chronic ecosystem exposure to dieldren, we saw everything from
04:52
population increases to extinction of target fish species, depending
04:58
on how the ecosystem was organized.
04:59
In other words, the amount of food available, whether or not another
05:02
species was present to compete for the food, and the exploitation rate or
05:03
fishing pressure on the target species.
05:03
After finishing my master's degree in fisheries, I ended up working
05:07
in the Bahamas for a year, working in Alaska for six months or so,
05:14
and working out of John Day; just the life of an itinerant biologist.
05:26
I guess home is where the storage locker is.
05:28
You were a “Bohemian” biologist?
05:30
Yeah.
05:31
I
05:35
ended up coming back to Corvallis because that's where my storage locker was.
05:41
So, I did a little bit of everything, mostly
05:49
on different aspects of research.
05:51
For example, when I was working in the Bahamas, it was for the
05:54
Caribbean Marine Research Station on
05:59
a development project looking at the use of tilapia aquaculture in the Caribbean.
06:05
Tilapia are a salt-tolerant freshwater fish, but we were studying the feasibility
06:07
of raising them in ocean cages.
06:07
In Alaska, I was doing a project related to
06:16
a new hatchery they had developed.
06:18
I was working at the hatchery, but because I had a research background,
06:21
they had me doing some bioassays trying to figure out what their problems
06:28
were up there, why the fish were not surviving in their incubators.
06:35
So, anyway, that's all beside the point, but--
06:39
These are long interviews, so they're not beside the
06:45
point.
06:45
[Laughs]
06:45
Alright.
06:45
A little joke, an oral historian’s joke.
06:50
So anyway, came back to Corvallis and was working in a position doing
06:58
bird work with Kim Nelson on marbled
07:06
murrelets.
07:06
Realized I had to get up really early in the morning to study birds, and
07:11
figured that fish were more to my liking.
07:14
We confirmed that, and so
07:14
-- Besides, you've got to go up really
07:20
high to get to those nests of the murrelet, right?
07:23
Fortunately, I wasn't doing that.
07:24
But I did find one of the first nest trees
07:30
[for marbled murrelets] in the Cummins Creek drainage.
07:31
That was pretty fun to locate that.
07:35
But, I
07:38
continued to apply for jobs in
07:42
fisheries and was hired as a temporary person for the U.S.
07:48
Forest Service in research.
07:49
With the Forest Service?
07:49
Yes.
07:50
Was that here in Corvallis?
07:52
In Corvallis, as I had come back to Corvallis.
07:56
Kim was kind enough to let me skip out on her in the middle of the field season
08:02
and train my replacement, and then, I started working for Gordie [Reeves]
08:06
and Jim [Sedell] and Fred Everest [aquatics/fisheries scientists] at the
08:08
Pacific Northwest Research Station.
08:08
So, you go back with Gordon quite a long time then?
08:11
Quite a long time, yeah.
08:12
So, I guess that would have been 1988, maybe.
08:16
Right during the height of the Forest Wars, leading up towards what
08:19
became the whole process leading to the Northwest Forest Plan?
08:22
That's right.
08:26
In many ways my interests in biology had always been related to policy and
08:36
how biology and chemistry could inform better decisions related
08:40
to water quality and water.
08:44
It really wasn't until after I
08:49
started working for the Forest Service
08:53
in the height of the timber wars, that I
09:03
realized how important stream habitat was in the whole equation.
09:06
Started
09:11
working on field crews, running field crews for the summer, then
09:18
a full-time permanent position came open after that first
09:21
summer, and I was offered that.
09:27
Hugely fortunate to be in the right place at the right time when that happened.
09:32
So, I ran the field crews a couple of summers.
09:44
Data
09:55
gets collected, it's really fun during the field season, everything's
09:59
exciting, and then, the storage and processing of the data comes along.
10:05
I realized that we hadn't put a lot of thought toward how the data were
10:09
going to be maintained over the long-term, so I took on that job.
10:17
I set up a database.”
10:18
Then, as Gordie and Jim
10:23
got drawn into policy-related projects, my interest shifted to those.
10:31
I was tangentially-involved during the Gang of Four [Scientific
10:34
Panel on Late-Successional Forest Ecosystems] , helping develop
10:35
maps and a lot of background work.
10:42
Then I decided to start working on a Ph.D.
10:50
The Forest Service was again wonderfully supportive
10:57
and funded my project.
11:01
I was able to continuing
11:07
working for Gordie and him while working on my Ph.D.
11:14
So, you finished your Ph.D. right about when the forest plan [NWFP] was happening?
11:19
Actually, I was still in the midst of my Ph.D. when it was happening.
11:33
I remember really well, hearing that the President was going to
11:40
come out and do this, you know.
11:43
You're talking about Clinton's Forest Summit in Portland?
11:45
Correct?
11:45
Thank you, there
11:48
you go.
11:48
Yes.
11:48
In 1993.
11:49
Shortly after his inauguration, I believe.
11:50
That's right.
11:52
Everyone was so amazed he was going to hold this summit on such an important
12:00
issue to us, but in the grand scheme of things a president has to worry about,
12:05
it seemed just amazing that he would choose to focus his energies there.
12:11
And
12:14
as that started to unfold, who was going to be as part of the Summit,
12:18
and how it was all going to happen?
12:20
I
12:22
found out that Jim
12:25
was going to participate, Jim Sedell.
12:27
That was really exciting.
12:28
I can remember going with Gordie and a bunch of other folks down
12:33
to Squirrels Tavern to watch the Forest Summit on television.
12:41
And that was just such
12:46
a novel, out-of-the-ordinary, something I would have never
12:52
expected to even get that close to,
12:57
something as important and as
13:02
high-profile, I guess, as the President focusing on this issue.
13:08
I'd like to return to that later.
13:10
Now that you've given a really nice biographical sketch, I'd like to go
13:16
back a little while, and the ecology and the environment in general of
13:16
the South during your youth, in
13:24
Georgia.
13:28
How would you describe your childhood in relation to the natural world?
13:31
And if you have any stories or places that were favorites, throw those in.
13:39
I spent every moment I could outdoors as a kid.
13:44
And
13:47
I grew up in the '60s where there were roving packs of children who
13:53
were turned out in the morning, and called in in the evening.
13:59
We played and we built forts, and we rode bikes and we did everything
14:05
in sort of an idyllic childhood in a subdivision in Georgia.
14:13
How far outside of town were you?
14:16
We lived in the town of Cartersville.
14:19
Cartersville, which was about how big?
14:21
Maybe 15,000 people.
14:23
Okay.
14:23
And
14:26
at that point, it was a world away from Atlanta.
14:29
Now, it's a suburb.
14:31
That's why I thought, it was pretty close.
14:33
But back then, it was just a completely different universe.
14:36
So,
14:41
I spent lots of time riding bikes and the distance that that
14:46
would allow us to get from home.
14:49
Then
14:55
as I got older, probably 15 or 16, and hanging out with people in cars, we would
15:02
go to the lake, a beautiful reservoir managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.
15:09
We spent all our summers up there swimming and hiking,
15:15
just enjoying being outside and someplace that was a little cooler
15:21
than the city in the summer.
15:23
Now, people have different favorite places when they play out in
15:28
nature, whether it be in the city, or literally rural or wild lands.
15:33
Were you especially attracted to the water back then?
15:35
Oh, yeah.
15:35
Uh-huh.
15:35
In terms of like polliwogs and salamanders and crawfish, etc.
15:40
Yeah, snapping turtles.
15:41
Snapping turtles and all that, yeah.
15:43
Yes.
15:44
You know, any time being in the South in the summer, water is everything, because
15:52
otherwise, you're just going to melt.
15:53
So people just gravitate toward the water, and I was no different.
16:01
It kept me outside and interested, focused
16:07
and poking around.
16:08
I didn't really know that much, but it just was, we were just fascinated.
16:12
And most of the water courses back there were muddy, and
16:17
you couldn't see into them.
16:18
So, high turbidity?
16:19
Yes.
16:21
To say the least.
16:22
Yes, to say the least.
16:23
So,
16:26
I have one story.
16:27
I remember being at a family friend's house, and they had evidently thrown in
16:36
a piece of chicken or something tied to a rope, and caught a huge snapping turtle,
16:42
which we put in a laundry basket and dumped out onto their yard and watched it
16:50
bite sticks in two, as of course, we were, as kids do, poking it with the sticks.
16:56
Did you ever get snapped by one?
16:57
No, no, no, fortunately.
16:59
Lose a finger there.
17:00
Yes, no, fortunately not.
17:02
I was one of the younger ones in that escapade, so I
17:08
didn't get very close to it.
17:09
But, just spending a lot of time outside, listening to birds.
17:14
And
17:17
when I got old enough, I started backpacking and going out with friends.
17:24
We would always backpack along rivers.
17:26
So,
17:28
it was more of an
17:32
aesthetic, spiritual connection, more so than an intellectual
17:38
kind of investigative connection.
17:42
Which is often how it starts for people, as even the most intellectual
17:46
folks in the world often started out with the pure sense of a child's
17:50
wonder, which would you could call spiritual, emotional, or what have you.
17:54
Yeah, and so the outdoors was just a place where there was freedom and comfort
18:04
and curiosity as well.
18:06
And because I felt so closely connected, I guess, when I started
18:11
looking at careers, I wanted to
18:17
pursue that.
18:17
Did you have a favorite place, first of all, right around Cartersville, but
18:24
certainly as you got around to camping and hiking, did you have like a favorite
18:28
place in the southern Appalachians?
18:30
Yeah, I would say the Etowah River, very close to our house,
18:39
within bike-riding distance.
18:40
The Etowah Indian Mounds were
18:50
right along the river.
18:52
We would go there and play, and knew that was a sacred site.
18:54
There you could
19:00
still see remnants of fish traps in the water.
19:05
It was just really, I would say that place was probably my most connected place.
19:15
And then later,
19:19
the reservoir, Lake Allatoona.
19:22
Now, how would you describe the ecology of the Etowah River and even the lake?
19:27
Talking pollutants, what was the condition at that time?
19:31
This is the pre-environmental age or right about the cusp of it.
19:33
Right?
19:34
Right.
19:34
And then I'll say, as I got older, in the southern Appalachians,
19:40
like the Nantahala River.
19:41
That area was really close to us and someplace that I was able to get to.
19:48
And having that comparison, I
19:54
was able to realize
20:00
the areas
20:02
around my home were polluted.
20:03
I mean, I
20:06
really didn't know that the Etowah was full of agricultural runoff.
20:13
You didn't know what an algae bloom was back then?
20:15
No I didn't, and I had no basis of comparison until I began to move
20:21
further afield and see the Nantahala River and some other rivers in
20:27
the Smokey Mountains that were less affected.
20:30
But the Etowah
20:36
River is an amazingly diverse river.
20:41
Aquatic diversity is just huge, a lot of endemic species,
20:48
and there are tributaries that are relatively undeveloped and unpolluted.
20:56
So, coming back as a trained aquatic ecologist looking at those areas now,
21:07
I have a much different perspective and appreciation for really what
21:12
gems they were in the South,
21:16
but
21:19
again from a more
21:22
mature perspective.
21:23
Critical perspective?
21:24
Critical perspective.
21:25
Now, they probably, even though you had the view of a child, I bet you
21:31
were not very safe in terms of water quality, but they're probably better now?
21:37
Yes or no?
21:39
I really don't know.
21:42
I'm assuming environmental age regulations, there might have been some
21:47
cleanups, like for instance, when I was growing up in Eugene just down the road,
21:50
my dad said, "You can't swim in the Willamette River." This is before the
21:55
environmental age when it got cleaned up.
21:57
A lot of the mills were closed and they weren't just dumping
22:00
raw sewage into the rivers.
22:02
But that's cleaned up, so you can maybe assume some of that, probably?
22:06
Yeah, I think so, but I also think that that area was relatively undeveloped and
22:11
that there wasn't a lot of heavy industry.
22:15
So, it was mostly agricultural pollutants, just the runoff dynamic?
22:19
Yeah.
22:19
I mean, there were carpet mills.
22:21
Dyes,
22:25
etc.?
22:25
Yeah, so, I really don't know.
22:28
That's a very good question.
22:30
Now, did you have a teacher in middle school or high school that was one
22:35
of those science teachers or somebody that got you turned on to something
22:40
about nature or studying nature?
22:44
I guess in the sixth grade.
22:46
I had a science teacher,
22:50
that’s really the first science I remember.
22:55
We had to do an insect collection, and I remember making a weather vane.
23:00
After that,
23:09
I was always interested in
23:16
biology.
23:20
I was sort of
23:23
less than a studious student [laughs] in high school.
23:27
In junior high, probably up to mid-junior high, I was a very good
23:33
student, and then after that, I was just having too much fun as a teenager.
23:39
You and me both.
23:39
[Laughs]
23:40
Yeah, so.
23:44
Anyway, continue on.
23:46
So anyway,
23:51
you know, academics was not my focus in high school.
23:59
Were you athletic?
24:01
No, I just really didn't have much of a focus in high school, I guess.
24:07
I had a political science teacher in the eleventh grade, who I loved.
24:13
I would get into all sorts of interesting debates with her.
24:19
The rest of the class loved it because I could sidetrack her and we'd get into all
24:24
sorts of interesting debates of the time.
24:28
And then,
24:33
my biology class, I also really appreciated, but I was also
24:38
taking typing and shorthand and--
24:41
You were kind of being tracked in the gender expectations
24:44
of the day, a little bit?
24:45
I mean, you sound more like a tomboy than a typical Southern Belle, but nonetheless,
24:50
you get my drift in this query?
24:51
I do.
24:53
And that's very accurate.
24:55
Part of that was my choosing, but part of it was not.
25:00
I think there were no expectations I would do anything.
25:04
Even though academically, when I was younger, I was on
25:14
a college-bound track.
25:16
When I got old enough to make decisions about academics,
25:22
then it became less important.
25:24
Then I could just sort of escape, with taking accounting, and, like I said,
25:29
shorthand and typing and those things.
25:34
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
25:34
I have a younger sister.
25:35
And your parents, what did they do?
25:37
My dad owned and ran
25:40
a truck stop, and my mom was a homemaker.
25:45
So, neither one of them had been to college.
25:47
My mom didn't graduate from high school.
25:51
But they were encouraging of that, if you wanted to, or was it that
25:54
they were indifferent to that?
25:56
Pretty much indifferent.
25:57
It was never something that was an expectation.
26:02
I think if there was an expectation, it would have been that I would have
26:08
married a banker, joined a country club, had children, and stayed in the South.
26:15
As they used to say, you go to school to get your “Mrs.” degree?
26:18
Yeah.
26:19
The joke they used to have about that dynamic.
26:21
Yes.
26:24
But when I
26:28
turned sixteen, there was a student who was a year older than me.
26:36
She had skipped her senior year in high school.
26:42
I talked to the [school] counselor to see if I could do that because
26:49
my senior year didn't really hold a lot for me that I could see.
26:52
And so, I think she was happy.
26:55
She said, "Sure, if you can find a school that's interested, I'll be glad to support
27:01
you in getting out of high school."
27:03
And this occurred when you went to Berry College?
27:05
Actually, I went to Shorter College the first year.
27:08
Okay.
27:08
Which was an even smaller liberal arts school.
27:14
It was in Rome, Georgia.
27:16
Which I've heard of, Rome, yes.
27:18
And Berry is actually in Rome, as well.
27:22
Okay.
27:23
The caveat was that I had to maintain a B average, or I would
27:26
get to come back to high school.
27:28
So, I learned study skills really quickly and I had a
27:34
professor, a biology professor.
27:37
And when I started at Shorter, I was
27:42
going into accounting.
27:43
That was my [first pick] . I could add numbers quickly, so
27:49
I thought that seemed reasonable.
27:50
Right.
27:50
But I spent a term in his class, and he came up to me one day after
27:58
class and said, "I've done everything that needs to happen to change your
28:02
major to biology. Come to my class, or my office and we'll do that." So,
28:06
I was like, okay, we can do that.
28:09
And you know, I was pretty taken with him because he had been involved in
28:15
the first Earth Day , was just a very
28:22
gentle soul, and very knowledgeable.
28:27
What was his name?
28:29
Phillip Greear.
28:35
I just really liked his approach.
28:41
So anyway, I'm not
28:45
sure what your question
28:48
was now.
28:48
No, this is great.
28:49
These interviews are spontaneous as well as scripted.
28:52
I mean, they're free-flowing.
28:56
I'd like to go back within the context of your coming-of-age, shall we say.
29:01
You've already talked a little about your experiences in the outdoors when you
29:04
started going hiking and things like that.
29:06
Do you remember any experience or place in which you saw natural resource
29:13
management dynamics, good or bad, that made an especially strong impact on you?
29:21
I think going to Berry really was the first time that I realized
29:27
that people managed natural
29:36
resources.
29:37
Okay.
29:37
The Berry Campus in Rome is on about 30,000 acres of land [27,000 – largest
29:38
contiguous college campus in world] . The story I had always heard was that
29:43
it was sort of spoils of the Civil War, and Martha Berry, who started
29:49
the school, saw these hillbilly kids, who could not read or write
29:54
[and needed educational assistance]
29:54
. Were they carpetbaggers from the North?
29:56
Pretty much.
29:56
[Actually Berry was from Rome, and school was started in 1902
29:56
as a Christian-based liberal arts school to help poor folks in area]
29:57
. Okay, interesting.
29:58
From my understanding.
29:59
Now, I could have the history completely wrong.
30:02
Well, now I have to look it up.
30:04
But she [Berry] started a school.
30:09
Because there was really no money, they had the land, but there was
30:13
really no money to support the school.
30:17
Well, economically the South was in ruins after the Civil War.
30:20
I mean, Sherman's “March to the Sea} went right through where you were.
30:24
Yes, that's right.
30:29
Out of necessity, the school was self-sufficient.
30:33
The students harvested
30:37
timber.
30:39
They built log cabins and made furniture for the cabins.
30:50
They grew their grain, as there was a grist mill on campus,
30:53
and they had their own dairy.
30:53
It was kind of artisan guild-type training, if you will, at least initially?
30:57
Yes.
30:59
But there was an academic approach.
31:02
They were trying to teach people how to read and write, but also how to support
31:06
themselves and to support the school.
31:08
They had to do this.
31:09
So, I think up
31:13
until the 1960s you basically had to work your way through.
31:18
It's not like that now.
31:19
It's really interesting because they'd sort of this farm-to-table thing
31:23
before it was hip, and now, they're really taking advantage of that.
31:28
In other words, the grow-your-own dynamic?
31:29
Yeah.
31:30
Yeah.
31:30
And I don't mean it like in Oregon.
31:32
Right, right.
31:32
I mean, like, food.
31:34
Yes, exactly.
31:37
They had their own dairy cattle herd and their own beef cattle herd.
31:42
It was just a pretty amazing
31:46
place to be exposed to the natural world, just being there.
31:54
In this the 30,000-acre tract?
31:56
That's pretty big.
31:58
Yes, it was pretty big.
31:59
That's a wilderness.
32:00
Yeah, and they managed it as a wildlife refuge.
32:06
Is
32:09
it still that today?
32:10
[Now managed by Georgia Dept. of NRs]
32:10
. Yeah.
32:10
At that point, there was a reservoir that we would hike up to that
32:16
provided all the water for the campus.
32:23
I was able to see timber harvest in a fairly sustainable way.
32:29
I was able to see that, if you manage your watershed, you can provide clean water.
32:35
So, they had plantation forestry or selective cutting?
32:38
I think there's both.
32:40
Well, it's mostly hardwoods, correct?
32:42
Or did you have s outhern pine, too?
32:43
There was southern pine.
32:44
Oh, okay.
32:44
Yeah.
32:44
And so.
32:51
Now, but going back a little further, did you see anything in the riparian dynamics
32:56
when you were hiking up in the Southern Appalachians, of an especially egregious
33:00
or offensive misuse of land that may have jolted you at the same time that
33:06
you're going through this learning curve?
33:07
I
33:11
don't really recall that.
33:13
I think it was more through the media of seeing, you know, rivers on fire and--
33:21
The Cuyahoga [river in Ohio that caught fire in 1970s] , in other words?
33:28
So, probably more through the media and having
33:35
some awareness during the establishment of the Clean Water Act and
33:43
NEPA, and those early laws.
33:48
Now, the professor that you brought up, or was the teacher was a high school teacher?
33:54
A college professor.
33:55
Greear was a college professor.
33:57
So, you can say he would have been the most influential professor
34:01
in your early college years?
34:02
Correct?
34:03
Yes.
34:03
Okay.
34:04
Now, you moved on to Emory.
34:06
Same question for Emory, an especially influential mentor
34:09
or professor, or class subject?
34:12
At Berry, not so much.
34:17
I said Emory.
34:18
Oh, okay, so I was at--
34:20
You can talk about both in the transition, okay?
34:23
I was at Shorter a year, and that's where I had Phillip Greear as a professor.
34:28
Then, I went to Berry three years.
34:31
At Berry,
34:35
I was interested in environmental health and ecology; those were the primary
34:41
courses that sparked my interest.
34:46
Most students there at the time were pre-med or pre-vet, and because I
34:50
was more interested in the natural world, there was not much for me
34:56
to do there from that perspective.
35:04
I never had chemistry classes
35:08
in high school, but I needed to take chemistry to be a biology major.
35:11
So,
35:15
I decided after taking several chemistry classes that I would go ahead and do a
35:22
dual degree.
35:24
I could have gone through a biochemistry option, as most people did,
35:30
but the Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences, Barbara Abels
35:34
taught physical chemistry.
35:36
I just really liked her, and she was one of the few women professors
35:42
that I had during my college career.
35:47
They were truly a minority back then [especially in physical sciences]
35:49
. Yes.
35:50
I mean, the equity is much better today, but it was pretty sparse back then.
35:55
That's right, yeah.
35:56
So, I think that as much as anything influenced my decision to take physical
36:04
chemistry.
36:04
I did three terms of that and ended up getting degrees of Bachelor of Science
36:10
in Chemistry as well as Biology.
36:13
And then at Emory, I worked for about a year-and-a-half
36:19
in their genetics department.
36:25
That was more of just a stop-gap, and
36:31
I'd say, a place for me to catch up, grow up emotionally, as
36:37
much as it was professionally.
36:39
Since I had skipped my senior year, I graduated from
36:43
college when I was nineteen.
36:45
And
36:49
Emory was also a way for me to
36:55
grow up a little bit professionally, emotionally, and just I guess, to mature.
36:59
I
37:06
was interested in the work that they were doing conceptually
37:13
because we were looking at developing a system to test mutagens and carcinogens
37:23
with fruit flies, so the day-to-day was incredibly boring, counting fruit
37:29
flies, looking through a dissecting scope at fruit flies, managing fruit flies.
37:35
But, from a perspective of coming up with a quick test for genetically-dangerous
37:40
compounds that might be mutagenic, then that was a way, and interesting.
37:47
And
37:50
I also took this combination of the
38:00
classes through the University of California [Taught at field location]
38:02
. Santa Barbara?
38:03
Santa Cruz.
38:04
Through Santa Cruz?
38:05
[UC-Santa Cruz]
38:06
. It was “History of Wilderness,” “Natural History of the Beartooths,”
38:12
and something else I can't remember.
38:14
Up in Montana, right?
38:15
Yeah, it was all taught in Montana, and then having the interaction
38:19
with the person that had gone to try out for the Olympics.
38:24
Up here in Oregon?
38:25
Yeah.
38:26
So, I think those two really
38:37
set me up to come to Oregon.
38:40
What do you think the value and the effect was of having kind of a collective
38:46
geographic experience from the Deep South, the Bahamas, Alaska, Montana,
38:52
Oregon and California, in terms of your perspective on the natural world?
38:59
I think just the diversity and the beauty.
39:13
Yeah, I would guess that, just the diversity and the beauty, and how
39:17
human use can really destroy those.
39:26
Now, you're in Oregon, you're an Oregonian now, you can safely
39:30
say that after thirty years.
39:31
Yes.
39:34
What was your impression when you first got here, and what were
39:37
some of your favorite places?
39:39
What made the biggest impact on you?
39:42
I just thought Oregon was gorgeous.
39:44
And
39:48
I remember driving from Oak Creek over here, just part of the McDonald
39:59
Forest, driving from there back into Corvallis one day and realizing
40:05
that I could see the Cascades.
40:06
It was a clear day and I could see the Three Sisters, these
40:10
beautiful snow-capped mountains.
40:12
And I was just in awe that I could live in a place like that,
40:17
and live so close to the ocean.
40:24
You know,
40:28
go into the Cascades or go to the Coast Range, and then
40:31
see these beautiful rivers.
40:33
I was just
40:39
awestruck.
40:39
What were your favorite places early on,
40:43
other than all?
40:44
Yeah.
40:45
All of them, I guess.
40:47
I
40:50
mean, that's what usually happens.
40:52
I know when I move to places, that everything was fascinating.
40:55
And then eventually, you'd start tracking in where you like to go.
40:59
What were your places?
41:09
I loved Drift Creek in the Coast Range.
41:15
I loved going out to the McKenzie River.
41:21
Elk River later became one of my favorite places down on the south coast.
41:25
That's where I did my work for my Ph.D.
41:31
I was really fortunate.
41:36
When I started
41:39
working
41:42
with the Forest Service, I got to see some just amazing places, and people were
41:47
paying me to see these amazing places.
41:51
Working out in eastern Oregon, southern Oregon, the Coast Range,
41:55
the Cascades, having the opportunity to work up at Mount St. Helens.
42:05
So, did you do work in Mount St. Helens area after the big blast?
42:11
Not until 1990, so ten years after
42:30
[Major eruption of May 18, 1980]
42:30
. [Break in Audio]
42:33
I was able to work
42:40
on the Clearwater [River] doing re-surveys ten years after the blast.
42:48
I think that was when Nova did a segment on St. Helens.
42:56
So, I have some recollection of being involved with that.
43:03
This is a little bit of a segue, but since you brought it up -- what did
43:07
being around that landscape, and the impact, or I should say recovery, less
43:14
far along than it is now, what did that tell you about the power of nature, and
43:19
even human limitations on what-have-you, managing, or other aspects of our
43:25
relationship to the natural world?
43:29
I think through that, and
43:35
my experience with Charles Warren, who had a very “systems
43:42
approach” to the natural world,
43:50
professionally I've always seen disturbance as being part of nature.
44:01
But,
44:06
when St. Helens was happening, I had no such understanding,
44:09
only that it was a catastrophe.
44:11
Coming
44:15
back and seeing it ten years later, and having the education I'd gotten
44:21
in the meantime, I realized it was just part of the natural world, and
44:28
we were very fortunate to be there to see this, to have seen it recover.
44:37
And it had recovered a lot in ten years.
44:43
Having
44:54
that awareness and looking at it, contrasting the areas that had and
45:02
hadn’t been harvested for timber before and after the blast, just listening
45:11
to people talk who had been there in the 1980s, looking at it from a scientific
45:16
perspective, then coming back ten years later to see all the recovery that had
45:22
happened, really cemented for me the idea that if we just move out of the way,
45:29
most of the time things will recover.
45:34
We may be able to help them along, but
45:39
there are cycles of disturbance and recovery that have gone on long
45:44
before humans were on the scene, and will go on long afterwards.
45:47
One of the most striking answers during my Mount St. Helens oral history interviews
45:54
was when I interviewed Jerry Franklin.
45:57
He said one of the most stunning things ever in his career was they were on the
46:01
pumice plain, this was days or weeks, might have been his second or third trip,
46:07
but it was very near to the big May 18th blast, and there were already little
46:14
shoots coming up through the tephra and the pyroclastic flows, evidence that
46:20
had been super-heated and incinerated.
46:23
Even that, at least in a moderate, ephemeral way,
46:28
was recovering.
46:29
It really struck him and everybody else that you don't get a chance to really
46:35
see that so close to the actual event.
46:38
Right, yeah.
46:39
And I would definitely agree that that
46:46
[Mt.
46:46
St. Helens] certainly shaped how I looked at disturbance and recovery.
46:51
You already had a masters, but you're transitioning to a Ph.D.; is that
46:55
about where you were in your career?
46:56
Yeah.
46:56
Okay.
46:57
Let's come up to your Oregon State experience in terms of your evolution
47:02
as a young scientist and learning what you were going to learn that
47:05
helped you become what you became, once you started as a Forest Service
47:09
scientist those twenty-five years ago.
47:10
Just tell me about key notes, key mentors, key information, key awarenesses, key
47:17
epiphanies, that happened along that route that took you along and made you who
47:23
you were intellectually as a scientist?
47:34
As I said, Charles Warren and his
47:39
conceptual framework.
47:42
I think he influenced many OSU grads that
47:47
have gone on, and
47:53
let's see, how do I want to say this?
47:56
When I was taking classes from him,
48:01
his perspective was that humans are imbedded in nature,
48:10
part of a natural socio-culture
48:15
system, and that systems exhibits different stages.
48:18
He
48:25
was my first exposure to that sort of systems thinking, and
48:29
it was very radical at the time.
48:32
The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife [OSU] were
48:35
sending people in to observe his classes, because he was radicalizing the students.
48:40
Politically or scientifically?
48:42
Both.
48:43
Both.
48:47
Taking the Thomas Kuhn scientific revolutions paradigm idea,
48:51
how would you say that he was challenging normal science?
48:57
By saying that
49:05
systems change.
49:07
That a static view of nature is not real.
49:12
And that systems change and that humans are
49:20
a part of nature, rather than apart from nature.
49:25
And that our actions can have profound impacts.
49:28
This was other faculty at OSU and his bosses that were concerned?
49:34
Yes.
49:34
About the direction he was going in?
49:36
Yes.
49:37
Yes.
49:43
The things that he was saying then, now are just taken for granted.
49:50
The way we view the natural world, and certainly, from an aquatic landscape
50:00
perspective, is certainly true.
50:08
I would say he really influenced me.
50:11
And it would be interesting, I know, Gordie, on many occasions,
50:15
has said that he [Warren] had--
50:17
Gordie Reeves, correct?
50:19
-- had an influence on him as well, so it would be interesting to check with him.
50:25
Gordie and I have compared notes before.
50:26
I don't know if he would have brought him up in this context
50:28
[during interview] , or not, but yes.
50:29
I can't recall.
50:31
It was a long interview, but now that you bring it up, when I'm
50:35
transcribing this or getting somebody transcribe it, I will look for that.
50:39
Yeah.
50:40
And
50:43
so, having that
50:49
as a foundation for all of the work that I did at OSU for my
50:55
masters was really critical.
50:59
And then I think moving into studying for my Ph.D., Gordie,
51:08
certainly.
51:10
Jim Sedell, he was amazing.
51:14
He was just one of those people.
51:17
A hundred people would look at a situation, and he would look at it and
51:21
see it completely different, and put the pieces together in a novel way, and
51:31
it would be interesting, fascinating.
51:33
And he was a great storyteller.
51:34
He was
51:38
very supportive of me as well.
51:41
Norm Johnson [OSU Forestry Prof.] was very much a mentor.
51:44
So, at that time when I was coming up academically, and working on my
51:53
Ph.D., the same people involved in the Northwest Forest Plan, were who
52:04
I looked up to.
52:05
So, you were destined to become involved with the whole process?
52:09
Uh-huh.
52:10
Because of your mentors.
52:11
You had like a triumvirate of the big names.
52:14
Yeah.
52:19
I remember,
52:29
the night or
52:32
day before the Forest Summit, or somewhere right around the Forest Summit,
52:36
there was a big concert in Portland.
52:39
I don't know if anybody's talked about that?
52:41
No, they haven't.
52:41
But yeah, there was a
52:47
benefit concert.
52:50
I can't remember who the performers were, but I want to
52:53
say Bonnie Raitt and Neil Young.
52:55
Some really big-name performers had shown up.
53:00
I say benefit, but it wasn't a benefit, but a free concert on Waterfront
53:05
Park, just to celebrate the fact
53:11
the President was actually going to do something about the spotted owl.
53:14
Well, this is in the early '90s, in '92, '93?
53:16
'93, yeah.
53:19
Yeah, I would have to go back and see.
53:20
I'd like to look that up.
53:21
Bonnie Raitt was at the height of her fame right
53:25
then.
53:26
That's when she'd come out with Nick of Time and some other huge albums,
53:29
a “second wave” of her career, after she sobered up, actually.
53:34
Yeah, and I can't remember if it was her or who.
53:38
Now, I want to stop and Google it, so.
53:40
[Laughs]
53:42
Kelly was looking for the details about the festival around the
53:47
time of the Forest Summit, but we have not been able to find it.
53:50
Investigation to continue.
54:02
[Laughs]
54:04
I really wanted to be involved, although I wasn't, other than
54:11
just watching Jim on C-SPAN and
54:16
having attended this conference.
54:20
Not conference, excuse me, concert.
54:22
It
54:28
was clear that there was going to be something more than the Summit, that
54:31
there was going to be the development of
54:36
what ultimately was the Northwest Forest Plan, but the Forest Ecosystem Management
54:41
Assessment Team [FEMAT] was going to be.
54:43
Which is what was named later as FEMAT, the acronym?
54:47
Yes.
54:47
And so, once I realized that was going to be pulled together and that Jim
54:53
Sedell was going to be part of it.
54:56
Gordie was in.
54:56
I think he was in the Virgin Islands at that time.
55:04
Jim needed help, I knew he needed help, and so I called him.
55:11
I think he had already talked to another one of his graduate students,
55:15
Bruce MacIntosh, and Bruce didn't want to take time out of his Ph.D. to
55:26
do this.
55:27
So, I called Jim and said, "Look, I don't care if I have to come sharpen
55:30
pencils, I want to be involved in this."
55:33
So, you volunteered to jump into the whole thing?
55:37
Yes.
55:38
Because I knew Jim needed help and Gordie was gone.
55:41
Gordie was coming back, but
55:45
I just knew it was going to be a big thing.
55:49
You knew this was a big thing?
55:50
Yes, I knew it was going to be of historical significance,
55:52
whatever came out of it.
55:53
But you didn't know how and why, you just knew it was a big thing?
55:56
Yes.
55:57
And I had some idea about the Gang of Four [Group of four noted scientists
56:03
central to NWFP process who wrote key 1991 report] and the importance that
56:07
had in gelling people's thinking.
56:12
And even if nothing really came out of the Northwest Forest Plan
56:19
in terms of important policy, I knew it was going to be
56:25
an interesting exercise.
56:28
Now,
56:30
I want us to remember at this point right here where you just got
56:33
to, but I want to take you back.
56:35
You got here in 1983, correct?
56:37
Yes.
56:38
This is really when the whole “Forest Wars” thing was kind of stirring up.
56:42
The spotted owl had already become an issue, but it didn't become a
56:46
lawsuit issue for a few more years.
56:49
What do you remember about the cultural and political dynamics of
56:53
that process in the '80s leading up into the early '90s, what you were
56:58
talking about just a minute ago?
57:03
I just remember so much
57:08
animosity between different factions.
57:15
Loggers wanting to eat spotted owls, and
57:21
Earth First!
57:22
That was a big deal.
57:24
Weren't they spiking trees and things like that?
57:25
Yes, they were spiking trees, and
57:30
I remember sitting in a little café in downtown Corvallis
57:34
watching log trucks go by with one log [large old-growth] on them.
57:42
Having come from the Southeast where there weren't very many places where
57:49
you still had native forest, or maybe no places where the forest was really
57:54
native, I was strongly aware we were fighting over the last scraps here.
58:02
I was very sympathetic and realized that
58:09
-- Sympathetic to the preservation aspect?
58:12
Of the…yes, yes, yes.
58:15
And sympathetic to the loggers' plight.
58:19
But cutting down the last stick of old growth wasn't going
58:22
to change their circumstance.
58:25
It was just going to delay it for a little while.
58:27
Which wasn't based just on the dynamics of scarcity here, it was also based on
58:33
world economics and systems theories of economics and the flow of products, etc.?
58:38
Right.
58:38
Yes.
58:41
So,
58:46
I
58:49
remember one of the questions that you asked me is when I first
58:53
moved out here, what were some of the things that struck me.
58:58
Just the clear-cuts, driving through the Oregon Coast Range and over to
59:04
the coast within the first week of me arriving in Oregon, and just being
59:11
mortified at the clear-cuts, not understanding anything about forest
59:18
management or why someone would clear-cut,
59:24
and seeing old forests next to this moonscape, and just not understanding it.
59:35
And later coming to have a better understanding of why someone would manage
59:41
in this way, the importance of riparian protection, and how all the pieces
59:51
could fit together in a way that you could do this and have some
59:55
sort of sustainable harvest, and not do it on every single acre.
1:00:05
But your first reaction was aesthetic, the visceral reaction
1:00:09
was about the aesthetics of it?
1:00:12
Yeah.
1:00:12
Not necessarily the aquatic, you know, trickle-down aspects?
1:00:17
Right, not so much that.
1:00:20
As you're asking me these questions, I remember my
1:00:24
grandparents who lived in Arkansas,
1:00:30
watching them watching someone
1:00:35
with a backhoe digging up trees.
1:00:40
They were clearing a lot to build a house, and watching that
1:00:45
tree be ripped up, and the sap.
1:00:50
I mean, I saw it as blood, and I know it wasn't.
1:00:53
I know it wasn't red, but in my--
1:00:56
Well, it was the blood of the tree, same thing.
1:00:57
Tree, right, you know, in my six-year-old's understanding.
1:01:03
So, you felt sad for that?
1:01:05
Yeah.
1:01:06
It was, and yes, I felt very sad.
1:01:11
I could see that it was not, so I took that one tree and spread it across the
1:01:21
landscape, saying that clearcutting,
1:01:27
and it wasn't just aesthetic, it was sort of heart-wrenching.
1:01:33
So, it was more than just purely aesthetic?
1:01:35
Yeah, right.
1:01:36
I knew that people harvested trees.
1:01:36
I don't want to sound like I'm
1:01:41
an
1:01:43
idiot, but just the scale and the contrast.
1:01:44
I knew that
1:01:54
there was o ld-growth forest, and I knew this wasn't old-growth forest,
1:01:59
and I knew that there was a big difference between what a healthy
1:02:04
functioning forest looked like, and this moonscape following a clear-cut.
1:02:09
When growing up in Eugene, even though I was very young and had little
1:02:13
understanding of what we're talking about here, the Coast Range clear-cuts
1:02:18
impacted me also, because they were more obvious and there were more of them.
1:02:23
And because it was easier to access, they were often by riparian systems where
1:02:26
you could do the old raft logging, as well as taking them out in log trucks.
1:02:31
Yeah, I remember that.
1:02:33
And I didn't really know what to do with the information.
1:02:36
I just remember I could see it, and I don't even know if I could say it
1:02:40
bothered me, but it made an impact on me.
1:02:45
I think for me, coming from the South
1:02:49
where I had the image of the South
1:02:56
as being a landscape that had been used a lot longer and a lot
1:02:59
heavier, with a lot heavier hand.
1:03:01
And then moving out here, I had an image of this
1:03:05
pristine wilderness, which clearly wasn't accurate, but this was
1:03:09
right in your face, a demonstration of how inaccurate that was.
1:03:15
Just the East-to-West geographic settlement-colonialization dynamic,
1:03:21
and development of public lands in the territory/state formations, meant the
1:03:27
whole management dynamic, in addition to the size of nature being bigger
1:03:31
in the West, guaranteed a different historical vector of that whole process.
1:03:39
Right.
1:03:39
I later came to understand the history of land-use in the area.
1:03:44
You mentioned the splash-damming and log rafting that
1:03:49
had been done, and I was able to use part of one study I took on
1:03:56
later, to look at the effects of that and to see the signature if the
1:04:01
signature of those historic practices
1:04:09
was apparent in modern-day monitoring.
1:04:15
And you can -- you can still see it.
1:04:17
Do you remember days in the Appalachians when you were growing up younger,
1:04:20
anything similar, when there was industrial-scale logging on the
1:04:25
periphery of any of the higher lands?
1:04:28
Do you remember?
1:04:29
Yes, I'm sure.
1:04:30
Yeah.
1:04:30
But nothing you recall right now?
1:04:32
Okay.
1:04:34
No.
1:04:34
How would you characterize your environmental ethic and philosophy
1:04:37
at this kind of nascent point in your professional career?
1:04:42
We're in the '80s [timeline in interview] , and how would you describe that?
1:04:48
I was, as
1:04:51
I said before, sympathetic to the need for preservation.
1:04:54
And
1:04:58
I was doing some volunteer work for different forest protection groups.
1:05:06
Not so much with
1:05:09
aquatics, writing some letters about forest planning.
1:05:11
And
1:05:14
my husband went on the “Ancient Forest Rescue Expedition,” which was
1:05:19
taking a huge old-growth log around the country to educate people about
1:05:26
the issues surrounding old growth, and just showing people the standard
1:05:34
approach of a timeline on a big Doug-fir log [using tree rings] , and this
1:05:40
is when Columbus was here [showing rings = when visiting the Americas]
1:05:43
. Do you recall the first time you ever heard the term old growth?
1:05:47
Probably when you came up here, I would guess.
1:05:49
Yeah, I'm sure it was after I came out here.
1:05:56
Now, during your graduate studies you obviously were focused on biology,
1:06:02
and aquatic biology, specifically.
1:06:05
How much training or exposure did you get to management dynamics,
1:06:10
planning, etc., or was it mostly just in the sciences at that time?
1:06:15
When I was working on my masters, yes, mostly just the sciences,
1:06:18
other than exposure I had, as I said, through Charles Warren.
1:06:24
That was early on in my coursework for my master's degree.
1:06:33
You couldn't have been out here in that time going to school and not been aware
1:06:39
of the role of science in management.
1:06:42
I think it would have been really difficult to have been in a natural
1:06:46
resources field and not really understood how they were linked.
1:06:50
What
1:06:56
other stories or experiences during the '80s up till the [Northwest] Forest
1:07:00
Plan did you have in the Northwest that may have made an impact on how you
1:07:05
developed, professionally and personally?
1:07:09
You've already brought up several, but I'm just asking you
1:07:12
to think a little more about it.
1:07:27
Yeah, nothing else really comes to mind.
1:07:30
Okay.
1:07:32
That's good enough.
1:07:33
Just talk to me a little bit more about any of your Oregon State
1:07:40
training or experiences leading up to the Forest Plan, and then we'll
1:07:43
get into the gist of the Forest Plan.
1:07:46
You know, I think
1:07:51
there's really nothing more to say.
1:07:55
Okay.
1:07:56
I was involved with
1:08:00
the science solely, and then the science was blending in with the
1:08:06
policy through the Gang of Four and
1:08:10
the SAT Report, and I knew all that was going on.
1:08:15
You're talking about the ISC Report?
1:08:15
[Interagency Scientific Committee]
1:08:16
No.
1:08:16
Well, I knew about that, but the
1:08:20
SAT, it's the Scientific Advisory Team.
1:08:22
[ISC and SAT teams/reports key in NWFP process.
1:08:23
1990-92.]
1:08:23
Exactly.
1:08:23
There's so many acronyms sometimes, you get it all jumbled.
1:08:26
I got you.
1:08:27
Right.
1:08:27
I was talking about Jack Ward Thomas of the ISC, the first one, pre-Gang of
1:08:32
Four [Gang of Four also did a report
1:08:32
-] . Right.
1:08:33
The SAT is another one, correct.
1:08:36
And so, from the point the aquatics really became important in any of
1:08:42
these discussions I was involved in.
1:08:47
I was working with these guys, so it was always sort of an undercurrent.
1:08:51
It was always there, I guess.
1:08:54
And what do you remember about Gordie and Jim, Gordie Reeves and Jim Sedell,
1:08:59
talking to you about as they're bringing you into the fold, about
1:09:03
how the aquatic element of this whole planning dynamic became included?
1:09:08
Because originally, it was off to the side, in fact, it was kind
1:09:12
of almost forgotten, until some people said, "What about the fish?"
1:09:16
Yes, right.
1:09:17
And you probably heard variations on that story?
1:09:20
Yes, I have heard that story from Gordie many, and from Jim, many times.
1:09:24
And how would you describe how you heard that and recall that?
1:09:30
Just that
1:09:34
they were going to do the Gang of Four, and said they didn't want to be surprised
1:09:40
by “some damn fish,” and involved the people who needed to be involved.
1:09:46
I guess Jim was called, and Jim brought Gordie along.
1:09:50
Called to Congress, right?
1:09:51
Yes.
1:09:53
Miller from California, I think, was the senator [Congressman] from
1:09:57
California [George Miller , D-Cal]
1:09:57
. George Mitchell?
1:09:58
Yes.
1:09:58
No, no, no.
1:10:00
Not Mitchell,
1:10:05
but Miller I believe.
1:10:05
Okay.
1:10:10
In my recollection it was Miller, and him saying he didn't want to be surprised
1:10:14
by “some damn fish,” which was very forward-thinking of him, because, given
1:10:21
the listings that were starting to happen, particularly in California for salmon.
1:10:30
He was wise to think that.
1:10:33
Now, what do you remember about when you first heard about the Endangered Species
1:10:36
Act, and then as you're seeing this whole thing unfold, what species, what
1:10:41
dynamics, what events, do you recall?
1:10:44
News reports, what have you.
1:10:47
I was in Nash Hall [OSU] working on fishery stuff.
1:10:53
Chuck Meslow and Bob Anthony and all those guys that had been involved
1:10:58
with the northern spotted owl were
1:11:04
there giving seminars about their work.
1:11:09
Eric Forsman [spotted owl scientist] was there as well.
1:11:12
So, I was hearing about it from a scientific perspective, then
1:11:19
things would show up in the news.
1:11:20
And
1:11:23
the Endangered Species Act was
1:11:30
motivating a lot of the science.
1:11:34
I always thought that was interesting, looking back at the
1:11:37
Northwest Forest Plan, how much science it motivated, and thinking
1:11:42
about the northern spotted owl and
1:11:47
science – policy motivating the science, and the science motivating
1:11:51
the policy, and the two just being so intricately connected.
1:11:57
Now, what species do you recall as being the most important species regarding
1:12:02
the Endangered Species Act and fish?
1:12:05
You obviously mentioned salmon, but what others?
1:12:08
At that time, it was salmon, all salmon, all the time.
1:12:14
Since then, and in the Northwest, it still probably is salmon.
1:12:21
Of course, there have been snail darters and others [Species setting
1:12:25
earlier precedents in ESA application.]
1:12:26
The Tellico Dam controversy, the first one?
1:12:29
Yes.
1:12:29
Right, the first.
1:12:31
Right.
1:12:31
I was aware of that.
1:12:33
But from a Northwest perspective, certainly salmon.
1:12:39
Okay, now we're going back to where I said we were going to return to.
1:12:42
You said before [NWFP process] , "I want in." This is 1993, correct?
1:12:47
Right.
1:12:47
Tell me how that played out?
1:12:49
You said, "I want in," how did you come in, and describe how you
1:12:53
got involved in the whole process?
1:12:55
This will lead you up to FEMAT and anything else at that initial phase.
1:12:58
Right.
1:13:00
I talked to Jim, and he said, "Yeah, I do need help, come." And so, I showed up at
1:13:06
the 13th floor of the U.S. Bank Building.
1:13:10
You got involved in the “Pink Tower” right from day one, pretty much?
1:13:14
Yeah, day two or three anyway.
1:13:16
They were still setting up computers and
1:13:21
people were being assigned desks.
1:13:23
I
1:13:27
showed up and just started working trying to pull together
1:13:35
information that we had, trying to pull together
1:13:43
ideas, just
1:13:49
at the very nascent stages of that.
1:13:53
We didn't know what we were doing, where it was going to go, or
1:13:56
how it was going to get there.
1:13:58
How would you describe the 90-day schedule deadline that got extended
1:14:04
to 120 days because it couldn't be done [Actually 60 days, then 90 days.]
1:14:05
How would you describe that process?
1:14:08
Like a major cram session?
1:14:10
Yeah, basically.
1:14:11
I mean, it was
1:14:16
like a bunch of people living in a dorm cramming for finals, staying
1:14:24
up, and pulling all-nighters.
1:14:25
Were you still living in Corvallis?
1:14:28
Yeah.
1:14:28
Because some people had motels up there.
1:14:31
Yeah, I stayed at some.
1:14:32
You did also?
1:14:33
I did too.
1:14:34
But the principals had apartments up there, and the rest of us…..
1:14:39
Because they had to be up there all the time?
1:14:42
Well, I was up there all the time, too, but I wasn't a principal, so,
1:14:46
the rest of us were staying in motels.
1:14:48
Okay.
1:14:48
Okay, but you know, other people had rented longer-term apartments.
1:14:58
I was up there,
1:15:01
basically for three months straight.
1:15:02
And I don't think I had a day off in three months, until the extension happened.
1:15:10
We were switching from hotel to hotel.
1:15:15
I'll bet you got to know what your favorite eating spots
1:15:17
were in downtown Portland?
1:15:20
Yes, most definitely, because we didn't have the facilities to cook.
1:15:24
And even if you were going to cook, there wasn't much time to do it.
1:15:27
But
1:15:30
yeah, it was an amazing time.
1:15:35
We didn't see the President, but Bruce Babbitt certainly showed up,
1:15:38
and having that Secretary-level [Sec.
1:15:44
of Interior] attention on what was happening there was pretty
1:15:47
-- So, Babbitt showed up periodically?
1:15:49
I only remember him coming once.
1:15:51
Did Mike Espy, who was the Ag Secretary, come?
1:15:54
I don't remember that.
1:15:55
Okay.
1:15:57
Yeah, Babbitt was the Department of the Interior Secretary at the time.
1:16:05
You were in the aquatic group
1:16:09
which had a certain portion of the 13th floor.
1:16:11
Correct?
1:16:11
Uh-huh.
1:16:13
How did the leadership dynamic play out?
1:16:14
Gordie was one, Jim Sedell was one, just tell me a little about them,
1:16:19
their leadership, and just how the politics of people working together
1:16:23
worked out, including your own role?
1:16:33
I always felt with Jim and Gordie
1:16:45
that I was given
1:16:49
respect and
1:16:53
an opportunity.
1:16:56
Working with them, it was sink or swim, it always had been.
1:17:00
And there wasn't a lot of hand-holding.
1:17:04
Just, this is the job, make yourself useful.
1:17:10
So,
1:17:12
I was used to that.
1:17:14
And that's basically when I got up there, that's what happened.
1:17:17
Because you'd already known them for three or four years by that time.
1:17:20
Correct?
1:17:20
Yeah, I knew that was what
1:17:28
the job was going to be.
1:17:29
Get up there, figure out what needed to be done, and figure out how to do it.
1:17:34
I helped a lot with the mapping.
1:17:35
Throughout my coursework, I did
1:17:38
a lot of landscape ecology,
1:17:45
looking at larger scales
1:17:51
and policy.
1:17:53
Through
1:17:56
my coursework, those were the issues or the courses that I was focused on;
1:18:04
landscape ecology, GIS, looking at policy.
1:18:14
I knew there was going to be the need for that and I could have a role to play.
1:18:20
They [FEMAT] had an overall GIS team, but getting the information to
1:18:27
the GIS team that would be involved with aquatics, then getting that
1:18:31
information back to the aquatics folks to do the necessary analysis with--I
1:18:37
knew was going to be a little work.
1:18:40
Now, you had people bringing in information to the building, and then you
1:18:45
guys would crunch the numbers or assess, and go back-and-forth from that point?
1:18:50
Correct?
1:18:50
Yes.
1:18:52
What do you remember as an especially challenging problem or question that
1:18:57
you were involved with, personally?
1:19:00
You talked about mapping.
1:19:02
A couple
1:19:07
issues were
1:19:11
even knowing where streams were [or their sizes] , as there were no good maps.
1:19:19
The scales on maps were too coarse.
1:19:23
Collecting information on where the streams were had been done with air
1:19:30
photos and on USGS topo maps, and streams were under forest cover.
1:19:38
So, we really didn't know what the stream densities were.
1:19:42
One of the main issues was the inadequate mapping of streams.
1:19:42
This was a big hurdle for assessing the impact of policy in relation
1:19:42
to various riparian reserve widths.
1:19:42
Policy options in FEMAT were intended to vary based on the size of streams, if
1:19:42
stream flow was year-round or seasonal, and whether or not fish were present.
1:19:43
Before, riparian policies typically protected
1:19:59
only the larger, fish-bearing streams.
1:20:01
But some of the options we were proposing required protection for
1:20:04
small, intermittent headwater streams.
1:20:06
These streams were not even represented on USGS topo maps.
1:20:06
Streams on these maps had been done with air photos.
1:20:06
Wherever a stream was under forest cover and couldn't be seen on the photos,
1:20:06
these were omitted from the topo maps.
1:20:07
Because nobody knew where all the streams were, how big they were, or
1:20:09
how many of them there were, we had to develop accurate maps for sample areas,
1:20:10
and then use these to evaluate effects of the different riparian policies.
1:20:10
I remember that as being particularly challenging.
1:20:17
Another challenge regarded two graphs in FEMAT that I remember Fred Swanson and me
1:20:24
sitting down one morning and developing.
1:20:49
Kelly is looking up what she just referred to here in the FEMAT document.
1:20:54
These.
1:20:56
Aha, yes.
1:20:58
So, what is that, Figure 5-12 and 5-13 in the FEMAT report.
1:21:04
[Cumulative effectiveness of several functions of streamside vegetation as
1:21:04
it affects stream ecosystems in relation to its distance from the stream.]
1:21:04
Distance from channel, tree height, the stand’s edge?
1:21:07
Right?
1:21:07
Yeah.
1:21:07
And this also had to do with the idea of buffers and how far the buffers would be?
1:21:12
Correct?
1:21:12
Exactly.
1:21:13
Yeah.
1:21:14
And what do you remember about this process, as didn't Fred Swanson
1:21:17
have some unique ideas about buffers that he brought into this?
1:21:18
I think a lot of the work
1:21:26
this is based on came from work that was going on at the Andrews
1:21:32
[Forest] . Stan Gregory and
1:21:37
Fred Swanson were really
1:21:44
instrumental
1:21:47
in thinking about
1:21:52
buffers from that perspective, extending buffers to intermittent streams and
1:21:59
defining buffers based on their functions.
1:22:02
And that's what those graphs attempted to do, looking at different functions
1:22:07
of riparian areas and understanding how far away from the stream
1:22:12
those functions began to decline.
1:22:17
Here's a specific question.
1:22:19
Okay.
1:22:20
What is the “riparian forest effect” and streams as a function of buffer width?
1:22:27
So, your question is, how does it affect streams, or what?
1:22:33
Yeah, what is the riparian forest effect
1:22:37
in terms of how it relates to buffer widths that were included the plan?
1:22:40
[Restated poorly-worded question]
1:22:40
. Okay.
1:22:41
That would be a more correct wording.
1:22:42
We are in the conversation here.
1:22:43
Okay.
1:22:45
I think there was a fairly good understanding of the direct physical
1:22:53
effects, like the distance large wood is likely to be delivered to a stream,
1:22:58
and how far away from the channel
1:23:03
root stability would play a role, and the stability provided to the stream
1:23:11
channel itself from the tree roots.
1:23:13
Also, looking at
1:23:17
leaf litter inputs and overland flow in terms of delivering
1:23:23
fine sediments to the stream.
1:23:24
I think all those had been fairly well worked out.
1:23:29
If not in forested land, certainly from agricultural land.
1:23:35
That first graph [in FEMAT example] , I think 5-12, dealt with those components.
1:23:42
The other components were more sort of microclimatic – wind
1:23:47
speed, temperature, and
1:23:53
humidity -- some of those characteristics that were just starting
1:23:58
to really be looked at the time.
1:24:01
How were the respective widths of buffers determined?
1:24:04
You had different stream sizes and classes, and different tree species
1:24:10
that were dominant, etc. How was that determined for these differential
1:24:16
areas in this massive area?
1:24:18
Because you're taking certain things and extrapolating, and then scoping them
1:24:23
down for application on this big area.
1:24:25
Right.
1:24:28
People looked at
1:24:33
some of those characteristics as you said, stream size, whether
1:24:37
or not it was fish-bearing, and
1:24:43
whether it was permanently flowing or
1:24:50
intermittent.
1:24:51
And there was some assessment that if it had fish, was permanently
1:25:01
flowing, and was of a certain size, that it deserved greater protection or
1:25:15
warranted a wider buffer.
1:25:18
There was an element there that also looked at the 100-year flood plain.
1:25:25
If the channel had an opportunity to interact with its 100-year
1:25:30
flood plain, and that extended out beyond the metric of tree height,
1:25:36
one site-potential tree height
1:25:41
[for smaller streams] , or two site potential tree heights for the larger
1:25:44
streams, then that functional element of
1:25:50
a 100-year flood plain would be incorporated.
1:25:52
And otherwise, it was
1:25:57
using the metric of tree height to define the buffers.
1:26:03
I don't know if that was unique, but it sort of--
1:26:08
But it was unique to the forest plan, this one [NWFP]
1:26:12
. Right, yes.
1:26:12
That's probably a better way of phrasing it.
1:26:15
Yes, thank you.
1:26:22
Based on that first set of graphs about the distance that large wood
1:26:27
could be delivered, I think that is
1:26:32
partially what drove that decision to use a site potential tree as a
1:26:40
functional metric, rather than as just a fixed distance away from the channel.
1:26:45
Prior to FEMAT, I think most buffers were defined in terms of just a
1:26:51
fixed width away from the channel, and these curves allowed those
1:27:02
widths to be interpreted in terms of the amount of function that would
1:27:06
be provided by those distances.
1:27:11
And by using tree height as a metric, you could scale it to a particular landscape.
1:27:22
I don't know if that
1:27:26
answers [the question]
1:27:26
. That's very good.
1:27:28
That's a very complete answer.
1:27:32
At that time, how would you describe how people determined
1:27:36
water quality, acceptable turbidity and sedimentation levels, and just
1:27:43
generally, the biogeochemistry
1:27:45
of stream habitat and quality?
1:27:49
How was that presented when you were coming into this, fairly new
1:27:55
in your professional career, and how do you remember that being
1:27:57
presented and what was the ideal?
1:27:59
And what was the condition relative to either clearcutting
1:28:07
or other disturbance events?
1:28:11
I think with
1:28:15
areas that hadn't been harvested, there was the assumption that all the
1:28:23
criteria you mentioned related to water quality would be acceptable to fish.
1:28:30
The temperature would be low enough, the dissolved oxygen would be high enough,
1:28:34
and the turbidity would be low enough, that the salmonids could continue.
1:28:43
They would have all the elements necessary to complete their life history.
1:28:51
Logging, if done inappropriately, without consideration to providing those
1:28:57
functions, could interfere with all those.
1:29:02
How would you compare the disturbance of clearcutting on aquatic
1:29:10
ecosystems, with large dam projects?
1:29:12
How would you contrast or compare those two?
1:29:15
I think
1:29:19
there was an awareness that forest harvest had a different effect.
1:29:28
You were basically allowing
1:29:33
the system to function in an altered state, whereas with dam projects, you
1:29:41
were basically changing the system completely, from a fluvial system
1:29:47
to a lake system, or changing the downstream flow from one that was
1:29:58
regulated by rainfall to one that was regulated by--
1:30:03
Spillway release?
1:30:05
Yes, spillway release, which was on a completely different temporal
1:30:10
scale and demand for water.
1:30:14
And no amount of fish ladders, no matter how effective, is
1:30:18
going to make that natural?
1:30:20
Right.
1:30:21
Or quasi-natural.
1:30:22
Right.
1:30:25
I think in some ways, people would contrast the vast changes that occurred
1:30:34
with dam building, with forestry, and say, forestry's really not that big
1:30:40
of an issue because we have a stream system that basically still looks
1:30:45
like it did before we started, and that will recover, particularly if we
1:30:51
take some actions to help recover it.
1:30:58
How would you compare the work during the plan era, but even if you want
1:31:03
to include afterwards, which was the bulk of your career really, the
1:31:07
coastal area versus the Cascades, and how would you compare the two?
1:31:15
In terms of?
1:31:17
Fisheries, just ecosystem dynamics, the water quality, anything that you want to
1:31:33
address.
1:31:33
Studies
1:31:36
of salmon fisheries were a really big deal in the Oregon Coast Range streams.
1:31:45
And you could relate the effects of land management much more
1:31:52
directly, because you didn't have the confounding effects of the dams.
1:31:58
A lot of the serious work on commercially-important salmonids
1:32:04
was done in the Coast Range.
1:32:08
The Coast Range is a very dynamic place with lots of land-sliding and debris
1:32:12
flows that made it a focus of research.
1:32:24
Most of my experience is in the Coast Range, west side, as opposed to Cascades,
1:32:32
the east side of the Willamette Valley.
1:32:34
A lot of work was done in the Cascades.
1:32:42
There was a lot of aquatic work in the Cascades, a lot
1:32:49
done on understanding landslides and debris flows, modeling them,
1:32:55
like the flume work at the Andrews [USGS Debris Flow Flume at H.J.
1:32:59
Andrews Experimental Forest] , and a lot of the assessment of riparian
1:33:02
function was done in the Cascades.
1:33:08
So, maybe the infrastructure was almost better there [Cascades] , but a lot of
1:33:12
the work and the working forest aspect
1:33:19
was in the Coast Range.
1:33:22
I don't know if that makes sense.
1:33:24
No, that's clear.
1:33:26
How did mixed ownership and management regimes, private, state, BLM, the Forest
1:33:32
Service, etc., affect what you were doing?
1:33:34
You're talking about mapping, as well as just the study in general of
1:33:39
aquatics.
1:33:39
How did you deal with that?
1:33:42
Because a river is a continuum, but
1:33:45
you cross all these boundaries.
1:33:46
I
1:33:52
think in the beginning
1:33:55
people were aware of
1:34:00
those issues
1:34:07
as terrestrial forest issues.
1:34:13
But it really became a much bigger deal, and heightened awareness, when
1:34:22
the aquatics were brought into it.
1:34:30
[Audio break.] Continue.
1:34:31
Okay.
1:34:32
So, I think with the drawing in of the aquatics that really brought home the
1:34:39
mixed ownership issue for a lot of people.
1:34:49
Going from
1:34:53
the FEMAT report to the Northwest Forest Plan and the development of Option
1:35:02
9, I think that reflected the need to
1:35:10
look across disciplines, look across ownerships, and try to concentrate
1:35:19
protection in basins where the Forest Service had or the federal lands had
1:35:25
the highest likelihood of actually contributing to conservation of the fish.
1:35:33
So, that was really the first time in FEMAT that people really thought about
1:35:37
bringing together measures for terrestrial and aquatic protection, and not just
1:35:43
looking at the aquatic protections as buffers versus no buffers, but
1:35:49
really bringing together the aquatics in more of a landscape perspective
1:35:55
When you're dealing with hydrology in general, you have
1:35:58
to think in continuum terms.
1:36:00
You have to in terrestrial too, and it's understandable you would
1:36:02
compartmentalize things there, but
1:36:09
nature is not that simple.
1:36:10
Nonetheless, you understand why it would be a differential way
1:36:15
of looking at things, even if that may be not the way to go?
1:36:20
Right, but I think that was definitely the contribution of the aquatic, by
1:36:24
bringing the aquatics in, it really moved forward the notion that you
1:36:32
had to take a whole landscape view.
1:36:34
I think they might have been able to sort of skirt around that, if the aquatics
1:36:41
had not been brought in when it was.
1:36:43
What do you remember the biggest challenge was for either you
1:36:45
personally, or for the aquatics team during this 90 to 120-day period?
1:36:52
Other than just getting the massive amount of work, but I mean a particular
1:36:57
vexing problem or a question that you weren't sure you were answering
1:37:00
well enough, something like
1:37:12
that.
1:37:12
I
1:37:15
think for
1:37:24
me,
1:37:29
understanding how it would be implemented, because I think that there was an
1:37:34
idea that the Northwest Forest Plan [would be implemented] . These were
1:37:39
scientists that were developing it.
1:37:41
In other words, really no managers or administrators to speak of, it
1:37:45
was mainly scientists, correct?
1:37:46
Right.
1:37:47
And certainly in the development of the FEMAT [report] . Then at some point
1:37:52
people began to realize that there has to be a handoff to the agencies
1:37:58
that are going to implement it, to the
1:38:02
management branches of the federal government.
1:38:06
And so, how that was going to happen, I think, was something that
1:38:13
I was particularly interested in.
1:38:16
The practicality of the idea translating to successful action and implementation?
1:38:24
Right.
1:38:25
And
1:38:31
then, the aspect that I was just talking about that you brought up about
1:38:35
the, sort of, the all-lands approach.
1:38:37
How do you get the most efficient conservation network out of the need
1:38:49
to protect these different elements?
1:38:51
You certainly cannot combine the approaches and have a separate
1:38:59
aquatic and a separate terrestrial [approach] , as that's not going
1:39:03
to be very efficient or effective.
1:39:06
Option 9 [called “Alternatives” in FEMAT language] was really an intent
1:39:07
to bring those together and say, how can we do this more effectively and
1:39:11
more efficiently on the landscape?
1:39:13
What do you remember about the various options?
1:39:15
I mean, I believe there were ten, and then “9” was the preferred option.
1:39:21
What do you remember about them, from more logging and less protection, all
1:39:25
the way up to the, what did they call it, the Green Dream, which was, 8 or 10?
1:39:30
I can't remember.
1:39:30
I can't remember, either.
1:39:31
But what do you remember about coming to grips with the various categories,
1:39:34
the Matrix and the calculus of it all?
1:39:47
I think they were incremental, and I think there had been enough efforts
1:39:53
before the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:40:01
People were familiar enough with NEPA to know that you're going to have to
1:40:04
present alternatives, and that these alternatives are going vary incrementally
1:40:08
in terms of the amount of protection.
1:40:10
And that was basically what they did, except for Option 9, which was
1:40:17
really the first attempt to bring these different elements together.
1:40:30
My recollection was watching people really struggle with
1:40:41
the likelihood that a lot of land was going to be set aside for
1:40:44
conservation, and none of the
1:40:51
options were really that suitable.
1:40:55
And then, deciding that something else had to happen, and then,
1:41:00
Option 9 emerged from that.
1:41:03
Wasn't that also because Clinton sent you guys back to the drawing
1:41:08
board to do one more round for the extra thirty days ? Correct?
1:41:12
That's how I remember it, yeah.
1:41:16
Okay.
1:41:16
They hadn't hit the mark.
1:41:18
It was too much land and not enough protection.
1:41:22
So,
1:41:25
that [Option] was a way to increase the efficiency.
1:41:28
That, I thought, was really a very fascinating,
1:41:37
a challenging and fascinating time for me, watching that unfold.
1:41:42
And
1:41:46
Jerry Franklin was a genius putting an Adaptive Management Area in
1:41:51
every congressional district.
1:41:55
[Laughs]
1:41:56
Even though the idea didn't always play out in reality, but it was a good concept?
1:42:00
[AMAs – only 2 of 10 could be considered “successful.”]
1:42:00
That was a very good concept and it was very politically astute, because
1:42:06
it was not by accident that there was one in each congressional district.
1:42:10
How
1:42:12
would you describe the zoning?
1:42:15
You have the reserves, you have the Matrix, you have all these different
1:42:22
concepts about different land use, the AMA's, and different tiering
1:42:28
of the different riparian systems?
1:42:31
Was it tier?
1:42:32
Tier 1 and Tier 2 key watersheds.
1:42:33
Tier 1 and Tier 2, yes.
1:42:36
How would you describe the creativity, the completeness, of
1:42:45
putting that zoning system upon a very complex political,
1:42:53
ecological, cultural landscape?
1:43:01
I thought it provided for
1:43:06
learning.
1:43:07
The Adaptive Management Areas, although they weren't implemented as intended, they
1:43:15
certainly provided for the understanding that we don't know everything right now,
1:43:20
that there's more to learn, and we can go about that in a very systematic way.
1:43:27
I thought that was, as I said, a brilliant addition to the whole approach.
1:43:34
And
1:43:38
the idea that we're going to shift the burden of proof from one that is
1:43:49
focused on proving that you're not going to harm something, or proving
1:43:54
that you are going to harm something to one that says, no, we're going
1:43:57
to take a pause, and you've got to demonstrate that you're not going to harm.
1:44:01
I thought that was a huge leap forward.
1:44:07
And we gave the opportunity to do watershed analysis to demonstrate that
1:44:18
you can
1:44:21
look at the landscape in a way that reads it to show you can successfully
1:44:29
harvest in a way that's not going to compromise the ecosystem in the short or
1:44:36
the long-term, particularly the long-term.
1:44:38
Then you can move forward.
1:44:40
So,
1:44:43
I thought it was a just a very comprehensive way to approach
1:44:48
the problem, that we didn't just take one element or another, but
1:44:53
brought many elements together.
1:44:55
I think that that's one of the reasons it's endured, because we did provide
1:45:02
the opportunity to adapt and learn.
1:45:07
Any memories or anecdotes or experiences, funny, stressful, about what I like to
1:45:18
call it a “scientific slumber party”?
1:45:20
Oh, that's a good description of
1:45:24
it, yeah.
1:45:24
Anything that you haven't mentioned, stories, instances,
1:45:27
blow-ups, humorous times, camaraderie, etc., that was special?
1:45:32
Anything like that.
1:45:33
Yeah,
1:45:37
it was an amazing time.
1:45:42
I remember something with Jim when
1:45:49
we were almost through.
1:45:55
I had to come back to Corvallis for something, and I took the disk
1:45:59
that had the master draft of the aquatics chapter on it, and I hid it.
1:46:05
Because I didn't want him to get ahold of it because he was liable to
1:46:11
insert something that would be quite surprising that none of us would
1:46:16
find until the final draft was done, as happened when we were reviewing
1:46:23
comments on the peer review draft.
1:46:27
Gordie Reeves, myself, Lisa Brown and another person there who was working
1:46:37
on the project; it was probably 1:00 in the morning, we are going
1:46:42
through peer reviews, and we find this statement we blamed on Jim.
1:46:48
I don't know, but for some reason we just thought it was
1:46:50
hilarious we just found that.
1:46:50
Nobody in our group that night admitted to having seen the passage before it
1:46:51
had gotten this far in the process.
1:46:51
The peer review commenter wrote, “What are you trying to say. What is this?” Jim
1:46:52
said something like, "The site potential tree is tall. The Olympic National
1:46:58
Forest increased thirty percent, clearly indicating the need for more research."
1:47:06
Total non-sequitur.
1:47:07
I think he was trying to say was a site potential tree is tall, so
1:47:14
riparian protection on the Olympic National Forest would be thirty
1:47:17
percent greater than previously.
1:47:36
But
1:47:47
Jim was known for statements like that.
1:47:50
Like that, yes, exactly.
1:47:51
He was a creative, ad-hoc genius, correct?
1:47:53
That's, exactly.
1:47:54
That's what I've heard about Jim.
1:47:55
He certainly was.
1:47:56
And so,
1:47:59
I spent a good part of my career sweeping up after him.
1:48:04
So, that was one time when I realized that I was going to be proactive,
1:48:08
hide the disk from him, and then, when I got back, he definitely realized
1:48:16
that I'd hidden the disk from him.
1:48:18
He was none too happy with me, but I think we all explained to him it was for
1:48:26
his own good.
1:48:26
That's funny, because everybody described Jim as he was kind of an ideas guy, with
1:48:31
stories like that, but always with love.
1:48:35
[Laughs] Would that be a correct way of characterizing him?
1:48:36
Oh yeah, most definitely.
1:48:40
I remember
1:48:43
one other point when, I don't know, it's 3:00 in the morning and
1:48:49
we're standing on Burnside Street [Portland] getting ready to cross
1:48:53
over onto the other side of Burnside.
1:48:55
There was some convenience store, me and Gordie and a couple of other people,
1:49:02
and all the homeless people on Burnside
1:49:08
[“skid row” of city]
1:49:08
. All you guys are wondering if you're going to become the winos of the future, right?
1:49:09
That's right.
1:49:09
So,
1:49:12
that was sort of interesting, the realization that it's just us and
1:49:16
them out at this hour of the night.
1:49:20
Yeah, Burnside, that's the place down there, and probably still is.
1:49:24
And just looking at the world go by during that time, there was a lot that happened.
1:49:32
I remember getting in an elevator with Jack Ward Thomas and the
1:49:37
incident at Waco [David Koresh/Branch Davidians, FBI/ATF] had just happened.
1:49:40
He was very, you know, moved.
1:49:45
You're talking about when they tried to raid the compound and everybody burnt up?
1:49:49
Yeah, if I remember correctly.
1:50:00
Another time we were trying to order a pizza, and no one
1:50:03
could decide what they wanted.
1:50:06
This was toward the very end, and Bruce McCammon, who was really
1:50:12
supportive -- he was in the regional office of the Forest Service.
1:50:19
I think he was the regional hydrologist.
1:50:23
He happened to be there that day, and he's looking at us, like, you're developing
1:50:28
the Northwest Forest Plan and you can't even decide what you want on a pizza?
1:50:33
Here is my little throw-in joke, is, the fisheries people,
1:50:38
should of course get anchovies.
1:50:39
[Laughs]
1:50:41
Yeah.
1:50:41
Even though I don't like it.
1:50:43
I don't.
1:50:43
I'm not an anchovies fan.
1:50:45
But, just silly little things like that always come to mind.
1:50:48
But that's what makes those things endearing memories.
1:50:50
Yeah.
1:50:51
Is all the non-scientific stuff, in addition to the other accomplishments?
1:50:57
Then, after Option 9 was selected, there was some
1:51:10
calming down of the frenzy that happened when we were
1:51:15
all in the Pink Tower nonstop.
1:51:18
The first 90 days?
1:51:18
[60 days actually, 30 days added later to deadline]
1:51:18
Well, actually.
1:51:18
But
1:51:21
then you had a sort of break, right?
1:51:21
Or did you have a break?
1:51:23
You know, I don't think we had much of a break.
1:51:25
Okay.
1:51:25
Anyway, continue the story.
1:51:27
But after that, there was a realization that it had to be handed
1:51:33
off to develop a plan, so the Record of Decision had to be developed.
1:51:39
And
1:51:42
a lot of the scientists who had been involved
1:51:50
they went on to other things, and that was one of the roles
1:51:54
that I played in that hand-off.
1:51:58
So, you were involved with the Record of Decision.
1:52:00
Yes.
1:52:01
Transfer and basically taking, well, that's just a publication . I'm pointing
1:52:06
to the FEMAT book on the table, that that big thing into something more
1:52:12
concise, [slapping desk] one, two, three, four, five [documents] , here it is.
1:52:16
Right.
1:52:17
Here's what it means.
1:52:18
How it's going to be implemented.
1:52:19
Correct?
1:52:19
Yeah.
1:52:20
And so, there was a period,
1:52:29
I can't really remember, but I know that Option 9 had been selected.
1:52:34
And this was around Christmas.
1:52:36
Of '93?
1:52:39
Of '93, yeah.
1:52:42
Option 9 [“Alternative”] had been selected.
1:52:46
The
1:52:50
federal government had been sued by environmental groups, been sued by
1:52:56
the logging industry, and if I recall correctly, there was an attempt
1:53:07
to modify Option 9 so it would be more protective because the Clinton
1:53:14
administration was concerned it wouldn't meet environmental laws.
1:53:16
At that point, that's when the interim riparian reserves on intermittent
1:53:19
streams went from half a site potential tree to a full site potential tree.
1:53:26
Those meetings were, I don't know if it was intentional or why they
1:53:32
were held around Christmas, it was just timing, but there was a lot
1:53:45
of—I think it sort of slipped under the radar that that was happening.
1:53:50
Which part?
1:53:51
The part where interim riparian reserves on the intermittent streams
1:54:38
went from half to a full site potential tree.
1:54:40
Right.
1:54:43
In FEMAT, it had offered that up as one of the approaches for
1:54:45
mitigation, if you wanted to increase the likelihood that it's okay.
1:54:46
We are interrupting, Rio, the Jack Russell terrier's [family dog in room]
1:54:46
attempt to eat the crumbs from my cookie.
1:54:47
I pulled it up because there's chocolate in it, and dogs are not
1:54:47
supposed to eat chocolate, so, excuse me, for the record there.
1:54:48
Here, just let me.
1:54:48
Half to a full site potential tree.
1:54:48
Right.
1:54:48
As I said, I don't know if it was intentional to reduce the focus, it
1:54:53
was just the timing that reduced the focus on that decision, or if it was
1:54:59
just the way it happened to play out.
1:55:02
But
1:55:05
I was involved in those meetings, and
1:55:10
the terrestrial folks were very supportive of that approach.
1:55:15
They could get rid of the 50-11-40 rule by doing that.
1:55:19
What, remind me about the 50-11-40 rule?
1:55:21
I can't remember exactly.
1:55:22
It was like you had to keep fifty percent of trees over eleven inches [diameter
1:55:27
at breast height] . [Definition: Fifty percent of land in each quarter
1:55:27
township under each federal agency's jurisdiction should be dominated
1:55:27
by trees at least eleven inches in diameter at breast height, with at
1:55:29
least a forty-percent canopy cover]
1:55:29
. Okay, it was a calculus [formula] used in the land portion of it [NWFP]
1:55:32
. Right, into the terrestrial.
1:55:34
Okay, got you.
1:55:35
So,
1:55:39
the rule was for spotted owls and dispersal habitat.
1:55:45
They looked at the riparian buffers and said, "If we have these extended
1:55:50
riparian buffers, then we could drop the 50-11-40 rule." There
1:55:58
was the decision to go that route.
1:56:06
I don't know that it would have happened that way if Jim Sedell had been there.
1:56:10
I kind of doubt it would have
1:56:14
[been agreed to]
1:56:17
. As far as him looking at it later, I think that there were a lot of disparaging
1:56:25
comments about “spaghetti” on the landscape, and riparian buffers taking
1:56:29
up [so much area] , they were called
1:56:35
riparian reserves, so they were attributed to the aquatics, or the aquatics were
1:56:45
held accountable for all that extra land.
1:56:48
Being withdrawn?
1:56:48
And being withdrawn, yes.
1:56:51
From potential use?
1:56:52
Right.
1:56:54
I think that was always frustrating because the interim riparian reserves
1:56:59
were serving multiple purposes, but the aquatics always got blamed for it.
1:57:11
I think it would have happened differently if Jim had been in the room instead of me.
1:57:18
What do you remember about the political pressures at the time, during the Pink
1:57:23
Tower or right after, from agency people?
1:57:27
In other words, the managers, who weren't in the room,
1:57:31
the public and interest groups, whether it be environmentalists or timber lobby?
1:57:37
What do you remember, just anything you can remember about those different
1:57:39
elements, starting with the agency people, but maybe working up from there?
1:57:46
The agency people were an interesting mix of perspectives.
1:57:58
The Scientific Advisory Group team they pulled together, the intermediate team
1:58:04
that came up with the revised Option 9.
1:58:06
I was on that.
1:58:08
And I had also been on the team, and maybe it was
1:58:15
the same team, I don't remember, but there was a hand-off to the
1:58:22
agencies to implement it and to come up with an implementable NEPA
1:58:28
document, the Record of Decision.
1:58:31
I worked with them, and I think that came out in '94, didn't it?
1:58:34
The Record of Decision?
1:58:36
In '94, yes.
1:58:37
Yeah.
1:58:38
The final report to Congress and President in '95.
1:58:40
Okay.
1:58:41
Like the end of '94, beginning of '95, when it was published.
1:58:44
Okay.
1:58:45
And so, I think for that period is when I was
1:58:52
[involved] . That year, I was working on it with them.
1:58:56
And
1:59:01
you know, I said it was
1:59:04
ninety—I
1:59:09
can't remember when we were.
1:59:11
Kelly is picking up the Record of Decision publication.
1:59:15
Okay, so this is the Record of Decision, it's April '94, yeah.
1:59:18
Okay.
1:59:18
It must have been Christmas of '93 when those decisions were being
1:59:23
tossed about to extend the riparian buffers on intermittent streams.
1:59:31
Once this was turned over to
1:59:36
managers to implement, the agency folks who had been working on the
1:59:42
plan, invested in the plan and that approach, going from FEMAT to the
1:59:49
Record of Decision; those folks were all on board about how to implement it.
1:59:55
They were supportive of the approach, supportive of the
2:00:00
philosophy of “let's start managing these forests again,” and not have them tied up.
2:00:08
But once it got beyond that group, then you ran into a lot of resistance.
2:00:14
You were just as likely to run into resistance from managers as you were
2:00:19
acceptance by the managers, of this new approach to doing their business.
2:00:27
Did you feel a lot of pressure?
2:00:30
I mean, they weren't allowed in the room in the Pink Tower, but they probably
2:00:35
tried to influence things perhaps?
2:00:38
I don't know so much in going from
2:00:44
FEMAT to the Record of Decision, but after the Record of Decision, I
2:00:55
just got this feeling that the people who were resisting it felt like - we
2:01:01
were here before this President came along, and we're going to be here
2:01:04
long after this President leaves.
2:01:07
If we drag our feet long enough, then we won't really have to deal with
2:01:11
the implications of this forest plan.
2:01:16
In other words, people that were of the old school, the traditional.
2:01:19
Right.
2:01:20
For the perspective of Forest Service people, you mean the
2:01:23
"get out the cut" people.
2:01:25
Right?
2:01:26
Yes, with people that had been rewarded their entire career for
2:01:30
“getting out the cut,” when this new approach came along, there
2:01:36
was a lot of resistance, understandably. But
2:01:41
I feel like, being in an agency where you survive multiple
2:01:49
presidential administrations,
2:01:54
then that's the way people were looking at this. They just said, “If
2:01:59
we drag our heels long enough, then this too, shall pass.” But it didn't.
2:02:09
You just had to find the people that were more supportive and
2:02:16
forward-thinking to work with.
2:02:18
And look for allies among the different agencies, whether the Fish
2:02:26
and Wildlife Service, NMFS [National Marine Fisheries Service] , or
2:02:30
Forest Service, to begin to implement this in a way that
2:02:36
they could stay out of court.
2:02:38
How do you remember
2:03:01
it being presented to you, and how do you remember conceptualizing the
2:03:06
fact that, I won't say for the first time in history, but first time in
2:03:11
recent history in my memory, that scientists, free from typical political
2:03:19
and administrative considerations, were allowed to run with it?
2:03:25
How would you describe that?
2:03:26
How was it presented?
2:03:27
How did people like Gordie and Jim and other senior people, Jerry Franklin, and
2:03:32
even you, perceived how novel this was?
2:03:42
I had watched the log jam, you know, develop and--
2:03:43
You're talking about the political “log jam”? [“Forest Wars,” injunction
2:03:43
stopping logging on federal lands in NW over spotted owl/ESA.]
2:03:43
Log jam, yes.
2:03:43
Just to be clear there.
2:03:43
There were other kinds of log jams [physical logs/rafts - timber
2:03:43
industry/transport/storage methods] on the rivers.
2:03:43
I had watched the political log jam
2:03:46
develop, and
2:04:01
seen the distrust, the public distrust
2:04:07
of the managers and politicians, and everybody involved up until that point.
2:04:17
The only people that really hadn't been in the room and still
2:04:20
had a relatively untarnished reputation, were the scientists.
2:04:26
And so, having it handed off to them seemed in some ways a really
2:04:33
logical step, but a novel step.
2:04:37
It was interesting because so few of the scientists had any real
2:04:43
understanding of NEPA or the laws.
2:04:47
I mean, the Endangered Species Act, yes, but nobody knew about
2:04:51
FACA [Federal Advisory Committee Act] or these other laws.
2:04:54
It was just like, let's get in a room and do this thing,
2:05:02
knowing that it was
2:05:06
in some says a logical step.
2:05:09
In other ways it was an unprecedented, just as you said, an unprecedented
2:05:16
step to turn this over to the scientists to try to figure it out.
2:05:21
But
2:05:24
I guess it's the adage of not using the same approach that got
2:05:31
you into this situation to get you out, you know, and this was trying
2:05:35
something different anyway, too.
2:05:39
The idea being objective science would be relatively free of typical biases?
2:05:46
Yeah, and they were the only people left with an untarnished reputation.
2:05:52
How successful do you think the teams were at doing that?
2:05:57
About keeping their biases out, or
2:06:01
-- ? Well, nobody is filter-free [cultural/psychological]
2:06:06
. No.
2:06:06
Now you could do a survey of who votes for whom and that kind of
2:06:10
stuff, but in terms of understanding that nothing is perfect, how well do
2:06:14
you think the objectivist paradigm was dominant in the whole process?
2:06:27
I think scientists have the advantage of being trained to be
2:06:30
aware of their biases, and so are
2:06:34
aware at least a little bit more.
2:06:37
Bias can creep in, and their job is to try to keep it out as much as possible.
2:06:44
From that perspective, I think
2:06:51
the effort was relatively unaffected by people's biases.
2:06:55
There really was an attempt to look at the science objectively, and ask, “What
2:07:01
do we know. What are the data gaps? What's necessary to move forward?” And
2:07:08
make an effort to have outside reviewers look at the approach and evaluate it.
2:07:20
So,
2:07:25
I think we did the best job we could.
2:07:27
Well,
2:07:30
120 days is not very long.
2:07:32
No, no.
2:07:33
If you think about how long it takes to write great books and research studies,
2:07:37
I mean, horizons of years and decades.
2:07:40
But
2:07:42
really, what you guys did is you synthesized,
2:07:47
which is a form of original research [work] , because synthesis is
2:07:50
taking what was brought in from wherever before, and not compiling
2:07:55
or presenting it in the same way.
2:07:57
So, it is a form of original research or interpretation.
2:08:00
Correct?
2:08:01
Yeah.
2:08:02
Okay.
2:08:02
And we certainly weren't doing experimental research.
2:08:07
You weren't out tromping the streams while you were running out from the Pink Tower?
2:08:14
I don't know that people looked at it as a research project.
2:08:17
I mean, there was certainly analysis, you know, analytical efforts that
2:08:22
went on as part of it, but I don't think anybody really looked at the
2:08:27
development of the plan as a research project or FEMAT itself, although it
2:08:31
certainly could have been turned into a hugely interesting sociological study.
2:08:36
Just putting that many people in a room under high pressure for 120 days.
2:08:45
I think what's come from it has certainly
2:08:51
generated a lot of research and been
2:08:58
the subject of research and the motivator for a lot of research.
2:09:03
So, just for example, if you do a Google scholar search on
2:09:11
headwater streams and you look at the period before 1993 and the period after
2:09:15
1993, it's was just an exponential increase in the amount of studies
2:09:22
that has been done on intermittent streams or headwater streams.
2:09:27
Part of that, I think, is just that there's been an explosion of
2:09:30
research in general, but on that topic in particular, FEMAT drove it.
2:09:38
We had some understanding that intermittent streams were
2:09:42
important and are connected to permanently flowing streams, but
2:09:49
what those connections were and to what extent and how far they extended,
2:09:55
I think that's been a whole area of research that's developed since then.
2:10:01
How would you compare the differential valuations of species that were
2:10:09
listed as endangered or considered endangered or almost, between the
2:10:16
charismatic fauna, such as the spotted owl and fish, which unless you're a
2:10:24
fisherman, it's not a sexy connection.
2:10:28
How would you compare the differential valuations of that?
2:10:33
I think by that point
2:10:40
fish had an advocacy group.
2:10:45
There's a commercial fishing group, the Pacific Coast Federation
2:10:48
of Fisherman’s Associations.
2:10:48
By that point the commercial fishermen had gotten on board, saying, we need
2:10:53
fish and they're connected to the landscape and how forests are managed.
2:11:04
You had that advocacy.
2:11:05
But you also had fish as being iconic for the Northwest.
2:11:11
Salmon are as much a part of the Northwest as any other species, as much or more so.
2:11:22
Although they're not warm and fuzzy, they are emblematic of the Northwest.
2:11:28
My point also was about differential valuations in culture groups where most
2:11:33
fishermen are not generally what you'd consider as liberal environmentalists.
2:11:37
No, no.
2:11:38
But your owl people are your typical, urban-based environmentalist groups from
2:11:45
the Sierra Club to the Oregon Wild, and all the different things in between,
2:11:49
and Wilderness Society and Earth First!.
2:11:51
So, you see what I'm saying about differential valuations and how that plays
2:11:56
out in society-at-large, but also within the sciences and how you sell the science?
2:12:04
Yeah, and good question.
2:12:17
There are definitely environmental groups that are
2:12:26
river-based.
2:12:28
Then, the Pacific Rivers Council, and
2:12:36
they were very influential.
2:12:40
You had
2:12:43
other, as you described them as more urban-based, typical environmental groups.
2:12:50
Granted, I'm throwing around simplistic concepts, and there's
2:12:55
a lot more complexity and cross-pollination, but still, you
2:12:58
get the direction of what I'm saying?
2:12:59
I think so.
2:13:00
I'm not 100 percent sure I do.
2:13:08
And maybe the valuation, I think, that word is throwing me
2:13:11
off, so maybe you could kind of
2:13:13
--? Just how society values these different things, and the different interest
2:13:18
groups and perspectives that find value in these things that are connected to
2:13:24
endangered species, ecosystem health, etc.
2:13:30
This is probably my bias, but I think from an aquatics perspective, people
2:13:37
innately understand the value of clean water, clean drinking water, and
2:13:49
understand the value of fish because there is an economic component.
2:13:56
The spotted owl doesn't have an economic base.
2:14:01
Unless you're a photographer and sell pictures of birds.
2:14:02
Yeah, so
2:14:05
I think in some ways adding the fisheries component made the
2:14:10
whole package more saleable.
2:14:13
It did balance it out between your typical economic interests, and,
2:14:19
shall we say, nature lovers, per se?
2:14:20
Yes.
2:14:21
That's a simplistic dualism, but you get my point.
2:14:23
Yes, definitely.
2:14:26
At that point, it became less about esoteric environmental protection
2:14:34
and more about weaving the economics and the environment together,
2:14:38
and how it allowed to tell the story that there is no separation.
2:14:46
Environmental viability is necessary for economic viability and social viability.
2:14:53
By including the aquatics, it allowed you to do that very clearly.
2:14:58
Now, I've heard different stories, but mostly that there wasn't a
2:15:03
lot of Native American involvement during the planning process.
2:15:06
But how did you take into account Native American interests, and fishing
2:15:12
is central to my obvious question.
2:15:14
I'm not going to go back to pre-Celilo Falls kind of stuff, but you
2:15:18
understand where I'm going with this?
2:15:20
Yeah.
2:15:20
I don't know that there was a real effort to take it into account, not certainly
2:15:32
proactively.
2:15:34
During the original process.
2:15:35
Most Native American involvement or taking their interests into
2:15:39
account was in the monitoring phase.
2:15:42
Am I correct?
2:15:42
Yes, in the public involvement part of the monitoring phase, right..
2:15:47
Got you.
2:15:50
Now, what do you think the most successful components of, first of all, FEMAT,
2:15:59
were as a whole, and the aquatic component, specifically?
2:16:05
And where do you think its shortcomings were, for both sets?
2:16:13
I think the
2:16:17
advantages, one of them is the shifting of the burden of proof.
2:16:23
I think that was a huge leap forward.
2:16:26
I also think the
2:16:30
attempt to integrate the terrestrial and the aquatic was a leap forward.
2:16:35
And I think the protection of intermittent streams or recognition
2:16:37
of those, as being critical, The watershed analysis had the potential to
2:16:49
really alter the way
2:16:56
federal land management is done.
2:16:57
It never lived up to that potential.
2:17:00
I think there's a lot of benefit in the way it was being implemented in
2:17:06
the State of Washington, by the state
2:17:12
directly, which coupled it with planning.
2:17:15
But the federal approach to watershed analysis wanted to ensure it was
2:17:22
decoupled from planning, because the land management agencies didn't want
2:17:25
to introduce another NEPA level.
2:17:28
They wanted to make sure you had decisions subject to NEPA, only at the
2:17:30
project and forest planning levels.
2:17:35
They were concerned that by linking project planning at a
2:17:40
watershed-scale based on watershed analysis, you would introduce another
2:17:44
level of NEPA decision-making.
2:17:47
Which is one level.
2:17:48
It's already hard enough.
2:17:50
Right.
2:17:51
And you'd enter into the dynamic of “paralysis through too much
2:17:54
analysis” along with political stuff.
2:17:56
Right.
2:17:57
I think that's why they were so resistant to it.
2:18:00
But the
2:18:05
watershed analysis sort of lost its reason for being by decoupling it from planning.
2:18:12
Okay.
2:18:12
So, it just became this hoop you had to jump through in order to move forward.
2:18:18
It never played the role of allowing people to really reduce the width
2:18:23
of interim riparian reserves, a key part of its intended role.
2:18:28
One of its intended roles was,,
2:18:32
here's a landscape and we're being conservative in terms of our protection or
2:18:37
what you allow to happen on the landscape until you do a watershed analysis.
2:18:41
After you do a watershed analysis, if you can document through the
2:18:46
information that you've collected, that the buffers are too wide as they were
2:18:51
initially proposed, you can adjust them.
2:18:54
I think people were really concerned that NEPA
2:18:59
was going to have to be invoked to do that.
2:19:04
So, they avoided that whole approach of adjusting the buffer widths, and began
2:19:13
trying to manage within the buffers and try to craft their arguments in
2:19:18
terms of benefitting aquatic resources, because that's what the standards and
2:19:24
guidelines required for harvest in riparian reserves, and it has to be
2:19:29
for the benefit of aquatic resources.
2:19:33
T hat was the approach they took to try to justify the activity.
2:19:40
But
2:20:04
I think the Forest Service might have been better served
2:20:07
if they hadn't resisted it so
2:20:38
fervently.
2:20:39
And this showed up again and again, in terms of not just the Northwest
2:20:46
Forest Plan, but in attempts to revise the National Forest
2:20:50
Management Act planning regulations.
2:20:57
You're talking
2:20:59
about 1976 Act, correct?
2:21:00
I'm talking about the '76 Act and the subsequent attempts to
2:21:03
revise those planning regulations.
2:21:06
Well, and to write forest plans before all these things happened.
2:21:11
Correct?
2:21:12
I mean, a lot of the forests tried to write plans up until '88, '89, '90.
2:21:16
Right.
2:21:17
And they [pre-NWFP forest planning efforts based on 1976 NFMA] were
2:21:17
largely successful [based on previous expectations/laws] , but eventually,
2:21:19
they weren't accepted because they fell short in certain areas.
2:21:23
Correct?
2:21:23
That's right.
2:21:24
They fell short in terms of their ability to handle these more complex issues.
2:21:29
And so,
2:21:33
looking at the implementing regulations for the National Forest Management
2:21:38
Act, Norm Johnson led the “Committee of Scientists” that attempted a revision of
2:21:45
those planning regulations that would have
2:21:50
allowed different approaches than planning just at the site and the
2:21:55
forest levels. And the management agencies’ hesitancy to introduce any
2:22:04
other layers of NEPA, I think kept
2:22:11
watershed analysis from playing a functional role.
2:22:15
It also impacted the ability to later modify implementation of regulations
2:22:20
for the National Forest Management Act.
2:22:24
It's all the same root, just manifested in different ways.
2:22:28
Would you characterize the FEMAT process as a gigantic, intense “NEPA” process
2:22:35
? Yeah, and I think that's what people had envisioned, more of a regional scale NEPA
2:22:44
process, looking at and bringing issues together that were driving beyond just an
2:22:53
individual forest, to try and look at them more comprehensively in the landscape the
2:23:00
federal forest lands were embedded in, and bring multiple federal forests together.
2:23:10
That's what the Northwest Forest Plan did.
2:23:13
I think that was the model in most scientists’ minds going forward
2:23:19
that really needed to happen to
2:23:27
bring national forest planning into the 21st century.
2:23:31
And
2:23:34
the National Forest Management Act planning regulations
2:23:37
have been modified now.
2:23:39
They were finally able to modify them after a few false starts.
2:23:45
Although there was more of a recognition of the need to plan, to do analysis
2:23:50
and planning on a larger scale, I do not think it was ever fully
2:23:57
realized
2:24:00
in the regulations.
2:24:01
Now, the '80s have often been described as the rise of the "-ologists" in
2:24:05
the Forest Service, but also other agencies, BLM and Park Service,
2:24:10
too, especially the Forest Service.
2:24:13
And you, the scientists or -ologists, were essential to this big plan.
2:24:17
What do you recall about their stature within the agency and the dynamics within
2:24:23
the agency after the Northwest Forest Plan, in terms of the science versus
2:24:29
the administrative, and how was it a continuation of the old, or was it a
2:24:34
rebalancing of the scales, if you will?
2:24:40
I would say it was somewhat of a rebalancing of the scales.
2:24:42
I would think that, at least in the Pacific Northwest,
2:24:48
research in some ways had been
2:24:53
operating on a completely parallel track.
2:24:57
After the Northwest Forest Plan, research was much more heavily involved in
2:25:07
the implementation and the direction the National Forest System and the BLM headed.
2:25:18
And within the management branches of those agencies, the -ologists, I think
2:25:23
they continued to play a very important role, maybe more so as time went on.
2:25:30
Some of them even became, like the chief of the Forest Service.
2:25:34
I know.
2:25:34
We're talking about Jack, right?
2:25:36
[Jack Ward Thomas]
2:25:36
Uh-huh, well, Jack and--
2:25:36
And then a couple more other people, too, correct.
2:25:38
Yeah, and Mike Dombeck and--
2:25:40
Wasn't he the first, though?
2:25:42
Jack, yeah.
2:25:43
He was the first –ologist/scientist [as Forest Service Chief]
2:25:48
. That's what I thought.
2:25:51
I'd like to talk more about the Northwest Forest Plan and its implementation;
2:26:01
its shortcomings, its problems, its successes, and your role
2:26:06
specifically in aquatic monitoring.
2:26:10
What was the feeling amongst your colleagues, and we can stay in
2:26:15
the aquatic area, or in general, within the Forest Service.
2:26:18
What was the feeling about accomplishment when this big event had happened,
2:26:23
the FEMAT and the Record of Decision, and then the official report goes out
2:26:27
to the Congress and the President?
2:26:28
I think there was a lot of relief and optimism
2:26:38
it would be
2:26:42
implemented in a way that allowed sustainable forest
2:26:47
harvest to move forward.
2:26:49
I think that's ultimately what scientists I'm most familiar with had in mind.
2:26:56
And relief that, as I said earlier, the “log jam” [political/legal]
2:27:04
had broken, and that our role in it, our primary role in it, was
2:27:09
over and that we could hand it off.
2:27:14
Also
2:27:17
implementing it through the monitoring aspect.
2:27:24
There was a lot of struggle in developing a monitoring strategy for
2:27:28
the aquatics that people could support.
2:27:31
The EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] provided an approach
2:27:38
they'd been using a long time, and
2:27:42
had that in mind as a way to go forward.
2:27:45
Then, the approach of the
2:27:54
“watershed condition index” and use of the decision-support
2:28:01
framework that was adopted, were definitely new and different.
2:28:07
I think regardless of
2:28:13
how they decided to move forward, whether using a watershed
2:28:17
approach or an individual
2:28:22
site
2:28:24
approach like the EPA had done, sort of a random selection of
2:28:30
sites, and I think ultimately….
2:28:32
It's
2:28:35
a big subject.
2:28:36
They came to a compromise in the approach.
2:28:42
In any regard, I think that calling it “effectiveness monitoring” was misguided.
2:29:01
I think calling it effectiveness monitoring was somewhat
2:29:04
misleading because it
2:29:08
never was designed to monitor the effectiveness of the Northwest
2:29:13
Forest Plan in a way people expected.
2:29:19
I think people had more of a notion that it was going to be
2:29:26
true effectiveness monitoring – if you do “X,” then “Y” happens.
2:29:33
But, there was no way to really identify or tease out the different
2:29:40
elements that people wanted to assess the effectiveness of the forest plan.
2:29:45
And you're speaking of both the terrestrial and aquatic, too?
2:29:45
Mostly the aquatics.
2:29:45
Because that's what you were involved
2:29:50
in.
2:29:50
Yes, that's what I was most familiar with.
2:29:52
And it seemed like it would be harder to do aquatic.
2:29:55
Yes.
2:29:56
Than terrestrial, because you have more of a physical thing you can look at and see.
2:30:00
Right.
2:30:01
Rather than a flowing, dynamic hydrological system.
2:30:04
Right.
2:30:04
And so, from a terrestrial perspective, I think you can.
2:30:08
You can do bird counts, you can do murrelet counts, you can do
2:30:13
recovery/vegetation analysis, etc.
2:30:16
Right.
2:30:16
And from an aquatics perspective, being able to say, if the Forest
2:30:21
Service implements riparian reserve design “X,” are you going to get “Y”
2:30:28
response in the fish or the habitat?
2:30:32
The fish are so far removed, they're literally removed from the habitat
2:30:36
by going out into the ocean, and the activities on Forest Service land
2:30:45
are often influenced by activities off the Forest Service land.
2:30:53
On private lands or state lands, etc.
2:30:56
Right.
2:30:57
And so, I think calling it effectiveness monitoring
2:31:03
left a lot of people disappointed, and they're still trying to figure
2:31:06
out what to do with the data.
2:31:09
If you wanted to characterize the difference in the data sets between
2:31:13
before the Northwest Forest Plan, then immediately after 1995; how would you
2:31:18
characterize that, and what were the strengths and weaknesses in terms of
2:31:22
foundations, data-sets that could hold muster scientifically, going forward?
2:31:30
I think from the aquatics perspective, as I said earlier, the data just weren't
2:31:37
there to do large-scale analyses.
2:31:41
I mean, we didn't have stream data.
2:31:45
Especially the small streams.
2:31:46
Especially the small streams.
2:31:48
We didn't have information on where the roads were.
2:31:51
We may have better information now, but the road layers and road densities
2:31:59
on federal lands appeared to be much higher than on private lands.
2:32:04
But we knew that's not the case, because roads were much better mapped on
2:32:12
federal lands.
2:32:14
The roads were probably much better mapped on private lands, but
2:32:20
the privately-held databases for their road systems were
2:32:24
not available to the public.
2:32:28
That may have changed, but at the time, that was the case.
2:32:32
Then you had a whole legacy of forest roads that were no longer
2:32:37
being maintained, but they were still [out there on the land]
2:32:39
. Or they were closed because of planning and regulations that were implemented?
2:32:41
Right.
2:32:44
Still functioning as conduits of water and sediment.
2:32:48
That
2:32:50
was a huge
2:32:54
data gap.
2:32:55
And
2:33:00
from the aquatics side, there were just a lot of issues like that, that
2:33:05
we didn't have the data to really do regional-scale planning and maybe a
2:33:12
little bit better forest or site level.
2:33:16
And then the next ten years, fifteen years, was really spent in
2:33:21
trying to improve those databases.
2:33:25
The Forest Service now has a very large data set for stream habitat
2:33:36
inventory and water quality, and
2:33:40
they were just starting to pull that together [at that time]
2:33:42
. How were you able to cross boundaries, per se, into non-Forest Service
2:33:47
land, and include other data sets, from BLM or what-have-you?
2:33:53
It's still there.
2:33:56
So, there's still a certain incomplete, ad hoc element to it, even now,
2:34:01
even though it's been approved?
2:34:02
Yes.
2:34:04
And that's problematic because of just the continuum and the flow
2:34:09
dynamic of any hydrological system.
2:34:11
Right.
2:34:12
Which makes it intrinsically harder?
2:34:14
Right.
2:34:17
How did you determine where you're going to go and start monitoring?
2:34:22
We need a calculus where we need so many main stems and so many this and so
2:34:26
many that, to be different tier streams?
2:34:29
How did you go about that, and knowing that when not all
2:34:32
the lands were Forest Service?
2:34:35
And how were those decisions determined?
2:34:43
I think it evolved over time.
2:34:45
I was not as intimately involved in the monitoring
2:34:53
framework.
2:34:57
I participated somewhat, and certainly not in the monitoring
2:35:00
itself, but in the development of the
2:35:06
decision-support framework.
2:35:10
That was more my
2:35:14
contribution.
2:35:16
But I think that there was some focus on the amount of public lands in a
2:35:22
watershed, and there was a focus on doing a random selection of stream
2:35:30
reaches within those watersheds.
2:35:32
And
2:35:35
I don't really know if there was a lot of monitoring of non-federal
2:35:42
lands through that program.
2:35:44
Certainly through the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife,
2:35:47
there was a stream monitoring program.
2:35:48
When you're talking about sharing of data, even though you wouldn't maybe be
2:35:52
the primary monitoring agency, entity or scientist, I am asking about however that
2:35:58
sharing process was done or not done.
2:36:00
I think there was the willingness to share data, but the formats were often
2:36:06
very different, as well as the setups
2:36:14
[studies, criteria, scale, etc.]
2:36:15
Describe to me exactly what “decision support” means in
2:36:19
the context of what you did?
2:36:21
Just so I'm clear for myself, but also for the record.
2:36:24
The decision-support model basically allowed
2:36:33
the data describing different aspects of streams to be brought together
2:36:36
and to identify different criteria that would suggest that a watershed
2:36:43
was in good, medium or poor health.
2:36:48
Okay, I see.
2:36:49
It just was a way to do this
2:36:54
transparently.
2:36:54
So, the data were brought together in a sort of a decision-tree.
2:37:05
You could tell at each stage of the tree which attributes were
2:37:13
most influencing the aggregate watershed condition or health score.
2:37:18
If it was roads, the amount of roads in the watershed, the amount of harvest done,
2:37:24
the water quality, or just where in this
2:37:29
tree
2:37:33
the most weight was coming in terms of how the final score shook out.
2:37:45
Before the Northwest Forest Plan, and then going forward, give me some examples
2:37:51
of problems before, successes after, and/or little or no impact scenarios.
2:37:59
Or different examples [range, good to bad] you can give about ecological
2:38:05
restoration health, better stream quality, etc. Or just talk about it in a
2:38:12
regional sense, or a sense between areas [within NWFP zone] , like Washington,
2:38:16
Oregon, Northern California, etc.
2:38:47
The monitoring suggests, at least from the perspective of restoration that watershed
2:38:53
condition is recovering in the Northwest Forest Plan area, just in general.
2:39:00
The Forest Service made a lot of investments in road removal, timber
2:39:08
harvest levels have definitely decreased, and there has been definitely
2:39:10
a decrease in harvest levels, and
2:39:15
thinning in riparian zones has occurred.
2:39:18
So, the idea that forests are more quickly aging in riparian areas,
2:39:27
growing bigger trees faster, I think there's some of that.
2:39:31
That's not the major contribution to the watershed condition scores
2:39:36
improving, but in general, I think that’s had some effect [impact]
2:39:43
. Now, the problems with salmon and other fish were more involved
2:39:47
with over-fishing in the ocean, or dynamics out in the ocean.
2:39:49
Correct or
2:39:52
not?
2:39:53
I think a combination.
2:39:55
People talk about the four-H's: harvest, hatcheries, habitat and hydropower.
2:40:06
I think it depends on the run of salmon, which one of those is the
2:40:13
biggest contributors to the decline of the fish.
2:40:15
And in some cases, it's all four combined.
2:40:19
Trying to
2:40:22
pin problems on]
2:40:26
one responsible factor is really difficult.
2:40:30
I
2:40:32
think fish harvest has definitely played a role, but harvest levels
2:40:35
have been greatly reduced, recently.
2:40:40
Back then, I think harvest levels were a lot higher [bigger
2:40:43
factor] , but not so much anymore.
2:40:47
Now, can you give an especially poignant example of restoration, either a main
2:40:55
stem or a headwaters stream, or something else that would be a good example?
2:41:02
On the other end [negative] , where maybe there hasn't been as much as you might
2:41:05
expect in terms of recovery, whether it be water quality or fish habitat and numbers?
2:41:11
I think the Forest Service has undertaken a lot of restoration.
2:41:18
There's a project called ked “Fivemile Bell Watershed Restoration Project”
2:41:21
over by Florence on the coast.
2:41:26
That project has been really effective in restoring some
2:41:32
meadow, riparian, upland and stream habitats, and establishing
2:41:35
stream and floodplain connections.
2:41:41
It is a whole watershed active restoration project.
2:41:44
With other active restoration, it’s often
2:41:52
difficult to assess at what scale you’re actually having an effect.
2:41:58
And
2:42:02
how important are our efforts are at recovery versus just letting nature take
2:42:09
its course, as you were talking about?
2:42:11
In other words, proactive recovery and restoration versus au natural?
2:42:14
Passive.
2:42:16
Yeah, more passive approaches.
2:42:17
I
2:42:20
know now there's more of a focus there.
2:42:23
In the Northwest Forest Plan and FEMAT, at the time that those plans were coming
2:42:30
up, there was an interest in using what we called pre-mitigation, where
2:42:37
you would harvest timber, either from riparian or upslope areas, put it in
2:42:43
the stream, and say that would mitigate negative impacts of forest harvest.
2:42:55
We rejected that idea in FEMAT, that this was not an appropriate approach.
2:43:01
But,
2:43:04
the pendulum has swung back the other way, and now people are once again starting to
2:43:11
propose pre-mitigation.
2:43:13
Even Gordie's [Reeves] has proposed it.
2:43:15
They're calling it "tree tipping" now [cut/put trees in streams to modify
2:43:18
streambed or water flow] . There's more of a context for it in terms of allowing some
2:43:28
short-term impact for longer-term gains.
2:43:32
The hope is that in restoring riparian areas, doing thinning in
2:43:40
riparian areas, if you put some of the trees in the channels,
2:43:44
you'll offset shorter-term impacts.
2:43:53
Neither the date nor research fully supports the practice yet.
2:44:00
It is interesting to see how the pendulum has swung back in that direction.
2:44:05
But I’m not sure that it swung back
2:44:11
based on a lot of scientific support.
2:44:14
So, that jury is still out.
2:44:17
Some of my work has been used to
2:44:28
develop approaches for
2:44:32
allowing more harvest along headwater streams.
2:44:41
To allow higher runoff, in part, or
2:44:47
-- ? More so related to debris flows.
2:44:49
So identifying areas on the landscape that are more or less
2:44:52
likely to initiate a debris flow.
2:44:54
If you can identify those areas that either are very unlikely to, then
2:45:04
doing timber harvest on those, may make more sense.
2:45:08
You may be able to relax protections.
2:45:11
Or areas that are really prone
2:45:16
to failure if you allow timber harvest on those areas, but provide for sources
2:45:22
of large wood along their runout path.
2:45:23
Then, when a debris flow happens, it will deliver large wood to streams downslope.
2:45:30
Now, tell me about large wood and why it's important.
2:45:36
I think large wood is important.
2:45:39
There's a long history of focusing on large wood in streams from pulling
2:45:45
all the large wood out of streams to putting lots of large wood in streams.
2:45:51
But the understanding that wood, particularly in the Pacific Northwest,
2:45:56
is such a huge structural element of streams, provides habitat and
2:46:02
structural elements, geomorphic
2:46:09
elements, to form and maintain pools.
2:46:16
It provides habitat complexity, including spaces for migrating adults and rearing
2:46:17
juvenile salmon to hide from predators.
2:46:17
Well, it creates a more eclectic fluvial system.
2:46:20
Yeah, it just does.
2:46:21
And it also affects the bio-geochemistry and the flow?
2:46:26
Right.
2:46:26
Rather than just have a chute for water?
2:46:29
Correct?
2:46:29
Right, exactly.
2:46:30
Large wood can reduce the distance debris flows travel and can trap fine sediment
2:46:31
that are particularly harmful to salmon.
2:46:31
It stabilizes stream banks and slows stream flow to store
2:46:31
food and nutrients for aquatic insects that are prey to salmon.
2:46:32
It also helps store the gravels salmon use for spawning.
2:46:32
Large trees are such an important, conspicuous element
2:46:39
in stream channels.
2:46:40
Historically people
2:46:44
understood that trees have to have some role, and it's just been trying to
2:46:49
tease out what roles large wood played.
2:46:53
And
2:46:55
whether putting too much large wood in streams was bad, or not having
2:47:00
enough was bad, and just trying to figure out where along that continuum
2:47:10
our interaction with large wood should lie.
2:47:15
One
2:47:20
of the more controversial aspects of the post-FEMAT process in the
2:47:25
implementation of the plan was addition of “Survey and Manage.” I 've often heard
2:47:34
the critique that
2:47:41
it was putting a “fine filter” in place where a “coarse filter”
2:47:45
would have been better suited.
2:47:48
Now, how does Survey and Manage, and the critique I just mentioned,
2:47:54
play into the aquatic aspect of monitoring, and the success of the
2:47:58
plan and its implementation over time?
2:48:00
From an aquatic perspective, no fish species were includes
2:48:03
in Survey and Manage.
2:48:04
For other aquatic-affiliated species, I think there's a
2:48:06
couple of ways to gauge things.
2:48:08
For some amphibians, Survey and Manage did allow for some learning to occur.
2:48:08
People
2:48:16
didn't know where they were, what habitats they were using, what
2:48:21
their distribution was, and how sensitive they were to management.
2:48:27
Some of
2:48:30
these efforts identified species that were less of a concern.
2:48:37
Some were taken off the Survey and Manage list because after enough
2:48:38
surveys were done, they found a species should not have been
2:48:41
there in the first place.
2:48:41
I have
2:48:44
heard the criticisms, that
2:48:49
it [policy] was a
2:48:52
“scalpel” when a “chainsaw” would have worked, but in many respects it
2:48:54
seems like it has been a useful tool.
2:48:55
[On Matrix and AMA lands, “Survey and Manage” required managers to identify
2:48:56
a suite of species, their presence, vulnerability to management, etc.]
2:48:57
The main thing I have heard is that it hamstrung managers, because the reality
2:49:03
in terms of time and energy to manage for
2:49:08
a potentially large number of species, is almost impossible.
2:49:11
Right.
2:49:12
And that it led to paralysis in allowing the concepts of the
2:49:19
forest plan to play out, maybe as they were intended originally.
2:49:25
I'm not as familiar with that, because most of the species that it applies
2:49:31
to are terrestrial species [Matrix and AMAs – mostly terrestrial concerns]
2:49:33
. That's why I'm asking you from a more aquatic perspective, but
2:49:36
I still would like your comment on the whole because most of the
2:49:40
problem has been on terrestrial systems and landscapes, if you will.
2:49:46
Yes.
2:49:46
And as I said, for some amphibians that allowed learning to occur about those.
2:49:54
Some of
2:49:59
the species I think have been taken off the Survey and Manage list because
2:50:02
after enough surveys were done, they found that they really shouldn't have
2:50:08
been on there in the first place.
2:50:15
It shifted the burden of proof.
2:50:18
They were able to figure out that we really don't need to worry
2:50:22
about these species, so we can pull back some of our concerns.
2:50:32
I know there's been a lot of concern about the Survey and Manage, but
2:50:43
in many respects it's been a useful tool.
2:50:50
But again, I think that was one of the pieces inserted between the
2:50:54
draft and final Record of Decision.
2:50:57
I don't recall Survey and Manage having been in the FEMAT report.
2:51:01
It was not.
2:51:01
It was added by people afterwards
2:51:17
[Within the implementation guideline documents]
2:51:17
. Doesn't surprise me.
2:51:17
Why do you think that Adaptive Management Areas have struggled
2:51:20
in their implementation with a couple of exceptions?
2:51:25
I think people have been reluctant to take the risks that were envisioned for those
2:51:36
areas, to actually experiment and come up with different approaches for management.
2:51:45
And it was just a lot easier to follow the standards and guidelines in the
2:51:51
Northwest Forest Plan than to try to
2:51:56
-- Take chances?
2:51:56
To take chances, with the exceptions being where you had strong
2:52:01
science support and advocacy.
2:52:06
A classic example is the Central Cascades AMA when it happens to
2:52:10
be right by the Andrews [And the Applegate AMA in southern Oregon]
2:52:11
. Right.
2:52:12
And you've got this group of super-committed, super-smart science
2:52:16
people right there wanting it to work.
2:52:19
That's an exception to the rule, though.
2:52:22
Yes.
2:52:22
How would you characterize the whole process between
2:52:26
regions, with let's take states.
2:52:28
Washington, Oregon, California, in terms of ecology, but also the
2:52:34
politics of it in your experience, from what you did in aquatics?
2:52:43
I
2:52:50
don't know that there's much difference between Washington and Oregon related
2:52:56
to aquatics on the federal side.
2:53:02
California
2:53:08
[is different] because it's smaller area in California [the NWFP area in
2:53:10
California is small fraction of state] , and the fish there were already so
2:53:14
threatened.
2:53:15
They were already so far at risk that it really
2:53:30
[was a critical case] . I don't know the answer.
2:53:32
It's a very complicated question.
2:53:33
It is, I don't know the answer.
2:53:34
It's one I haven't thought about a lot.
2:53:37
I know
2:53:40
[that] in terms of the state approaches, there are very big differences.
2:53:47
The State of Oregon has been very proactive in collecting data
2:53:52
and they have a strong research
2:53:56
department for fisheries, whereas, I think California and Washington have data
2:54:03
sets that are nowhere near as complete and extensive as the State of Oregon's.
2:54:12
But from a federal side, because the Northwest Forest Plan is this
2:54:18
overarching plan, I don't know that there were that many differences.
2:54:22
I just don't know.
2:54:28
Now, after completion of the original Northwest Forest Plan,
2:54:31
what do you feel were its strongest components, its weakest components,
2:54:35
and biggest unanswered questions?
2:54:38
And how have those initial assessments been confirmed,
2:54:41
challenged or modified in your sense?
2:54:43
I think the strongest elements from an aquatic perspective are the recognition
2:54:56
of the importance of intermittent streams, the shift in the burden of proof, and,
2:55:16
I guess, those two elements, and combining with the terrestrial to
2:55:27
gain efficiencies in implementing conservation.
2:55:32
And looking at streams from more of a landscape perspective, I guess.
2:55:39
How do you define a “landscape”?
2:55:42
Looking at streams from beyond just a small reach, and looking at streams
2:55:52
with consideration of the watershed through which the stream flows.
2:55:57
Because I hear many different definitions, depending on discipline, etc.
2:56:01
Right, yeah.
2:56:02
Like, your husband, an artist, would think of a landscape differently
2:56:05
than – [other people/disciplines]
2:56:06
. Yes.
2:56:07
A fairly obvious example.
2:56:08
Thank you for clarifying, or allowing me to clarify.
2:56:11
I think
2:56:16
those are some of the strengths.
2:56:17
Some of the weaknesses
2:56:21
have been related to
2:56:26
better understanding the tradeoffs between short-term
2:56:33
risk, assuming short-term risk, and longer-term benefits to aquatics.
2:56:39
For regulatory agencies, that's been difficult for them.
2:56:43
I don't know if it's their mission or personnel, or
2:56:52
just why that has been a stumbling block for them as much as it seems to have been.
2:57:02
That may just be because sufficient guidance wasn't provided, or the
2:57:09
connection in the plan wasn't well enough articulated to focus on acknowledging
2:57:17
the short-term risk for long-term benefits, particularly with restoration.
2:57:21
So,
2:57:23
I think that's something that there's been a struggle with.
2:57:29
Understanding which of the components of the Northwest Forest Plan really
2:57:33
contributed the most to any recovery that's gone on has been a very
2:57:44
thorny issue.
2:57:46
Part of that has been because of the way the monitoring was set up, and it really
2:57:51
wasn't designed to answer those questions.
2:57:54
It was designed to gather data, correct?
2:57:56
Yes, right.
2:57:58
Then the questions will be answered later?
2:58:00
Yes.
2:58:00
It was designed to collect data on status and trends in
2:58:02
aquatic conditions, rather than
2:58:06
validate the effectiveness of the plan’s components.
2:58:09
What people probably wanted was more validation monitoring or research, to
2:58:16
really take these different elements and
2:58:20
examine them in much more
2:58:25
detailed and much more systematic way, to really know, what are they buying us?
2:58:31
And I think the work
2:58:36
with some of the Adaptive Management Areas could have
2:58:38
allowed that to happen in a much
2:58:48
more rigorous way.
2:58:52
What has surprised you the most about
2:58:57
aquatic habitat conditions in the last twenty years?
2:59:04
Recovery or
2:59:11
otherwise?
2:59:12
The question I thought you were going to ask me is about the plan.
2:59:14
And the answer to that is that it's still around.
2:59:19
Well, you can answer about the plan, also.
2:59:22
Answer both questions.
2:59:23
Yeah, okay.
2:59:24
I mean, we're not stuck on a script, so you can go ahead.
2:59:28
From an aquatics perspective,
2:59:34
stream habitat seems to be recovering in some watersheds.
2:59:41
And I am not—as
2:59:54
I say
2:59:57
that, evaluating my answer, or my reason for answering that way.
3:00:04
I'm
3:00:07
not.
3:00:09
I think the decline in the amount of timber harvest has probably
3:00:13
contributed as much as any other factor, that and the restoration
3:00:20
related to roads, for recovering habitat conditions on federal lands.
3:00:28
Are you talking about the fact there are fewer roads that are
3:00:32
being cut across the landscape with all the commensurate erosion and
3:00:38
sedimentation problems they produce?
3:00:40
Is that what you're talking about?
3:00:43
I think that there's been a very active effort by the Forest Service
3:00:48
to remove roads that are no longer essential or which are harmful.
3:00:50
Or close them?
3:00:50
Remove or close roads.
3:00:53
Not just close them, but actually pull them back, revegetate them, restore them.
3:00:58
So, an active program of road restoration.
3:01:04
That's one issue, and I think that the overall decline in timber
3:01:09
harvest from the 1980's to now, has contributed as much as anything to
3:01:18
the recovery of aquatic habitat.
3:01:21
I think we've done some active in-stream restoration that has
3:01:23
probably benefitted habitat,
3:01:29
but again, I think it's just the reduced level of activity.
3:01:37
Coming back to the roads, I know there's been federal timber programs
3:01:41
focused on thinning and longer-term
3:01:48
multiple entries into stands, and I think that's the direction
3:01:54
people are proposing some of these areas be managed in that regard.
3:02:03
But keeping those roads on the landscape for multiple entries has its own set
3:02:08
of concerns and possible detrimental effects that aren't well-worked out.
3:02:15
So,
3:02:17
the ability to close a road after a harvest, you have to continue to maintain
3:02:22
this road for many, many years following, to allow multiple entries into the stand.
3:02:29
Even
3:02:32
though you were involved in the aquatics, and actually, you could
3:02:37
say that this has improved the economics of fishing, indirectly or
3:02:41
directly, even though we've had other problems we talked about earlier.
3:02:46
What do you say to the logging communities which have been decimated?
3:02:50
Not just because of longer-term trends of which this is a part.
3:02:55
That's one of the chief criticisms of the Northwest Forest Plan is that it
3:02:59
didn't properly account for that, whether it be because of things like Survey
3:03:03
and Manage and how that would affect projected lesser harvest levels, which
3:03:06
were even much lesser than anticipated.
3:03:10
How would you answer that to logging communities that have either been
3:03:15
decimated or in some cases destroyed?
3:03:20
On
3:03:22
a personal basis?
3:03:26
Personal or professional, either way, Kelly.
3:03:28
On a personal level, I
3:03:31
have a lot of empathy.
3:03:36
People's careers, their sense of purpose, how they see themselves in the world;
3:03:48
I certainly understand when you take those drivers away, it causes them, their
3:03:56
families, and their communities to suffer.
3:03:58
So,
3:04:01
on a personal level, it's very difficult to see that.
3:04:11
On
3:04:14
a professional, more
3:04:22
objective level, this is just an evolution of an economy that
3:04:32
loggers were caught in the middle of, and they were paying the price
3:04:39
for society's changing values.
3:04:42
I
3:04:55
guess what I'm trying to say is that society made different choices, and
3:05:00
society has not necessarily stepped up to compensate those communities in a way
3:05:09
that would value their contributions.
3:05:16
Taking away their livelihood without offering up something else for their
3:05:21
sacrifices seems like a cost that society should bear, and that the logging
3:05:28
communities alone should not have to try to struggle through that on their own.
3:05:35
Taking it from a dispassionate historical and geographic perspective, I say that
3:05:43
extractive industries have been victim to the pendulum swings of politics
3:05:50
and economics for thousands of years.
3:05:55
That's not a dispassionate, non-caring statement, just an objective analysis
3:06:01
of how they've been vulnerable because they don't have the
3:06:04
value-added capital usually valued in centers of political and economic
3:06:12
power, beyond what things [natural resources] they bring to the table.
3:06:15
Then, when that's over, it's over.
3:06:17
Right.
3:06:20
I would like to think that
3:06:26
where we are in our cultural evolution would provide more of a
3:06:33
support net for those communities when the pendulum does swing.
3:06:40
Maybe
3:06:43
150 years ago, when the timber barons were sweeping across [the country] , we
3:06:50
didn't have the capacity for any sort of social safety net for those communities.
3:06:54
But in the 1980's and 1990's, we had more opportunity to support those communities,
3:07:02
and I'm not sure that we did fully.
3:07:06
But
3:07:12
that gets
3:07:15
on to a whole other conversation.
3:07:16
No, that's okay.
3:07:18
Now,
3:07:21
the n orthern spotted owl came under attack in the recent years,
3:07:24
not by excessive clearcutting but from another invasive competitor
3:07:29
in the same family, the barred owl.
3:07:32
How do we reconcile the Endangered Species Act and human causation with
3:07:36
such a natural Darwinian process?
3:07:42
You can extrapolate that to your aquatics expertise or just comment because it's
3:07:48
obviously something we know about.
3:07:51
I think that just because those natural Darwinian processes happen,
3:07:58
does not let humans off the hook for their contribution to maintaining
3:08:05
habitats for species we co-exist with.
3:08:10
I think it presents an interesting quandary and interesting science,
3:08:20
an interesting quandary for policy and an interesting scientific
3:08:24
question, but I think it speaks nothing about the law itself.
3:08:32
The law itself is a valuable tool for holding
3:08:42
society accountable.
3:08:44
It's a checkpoint on human excess.
3:08:45
Yes, exactly, yes.
3:08:46
Thank you for saying that.
3:08:49
I understand the reality and the symbolism of it.
3:08:53
Just like an indicator species, it may not be exactly scientific for all places
3:08:58
and all times, but it tells us a story.
3:09:01
Right.
3:09:01
And it doesn't mean that I have to throw out the law and its implementation
3:09:06
just because there's a case in which it's being challenged by nature.
3:09:13
Do you think the pendulum swing [of culture and politics] may
3:09:18
take the Northwest Forest Plan away, the political one?
3:09:24
That's my concern, yeah.
3:09:25
And I don't know that
3:09:30
the next plan will be nearly as
3:09:36
science-based.
3:09:38
I don't know that it will be based on the learning that's occurred in
3:09:42
the twenty, almost twenty-five years since the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:09:50
If it
3:09:53
is firmly rooted in our increased understanding of these ecosystems, then
3:10:00
having the Northwest Forest Plan be replaced by something else, makes sense.
3:10:05
But replacing it based on the need for
3:10:14
or the short-term perceived need for just getting more wood out of the forest,
3:10:22
I think that would be a very sad commentary on where we are today
3:10:28
in terms of a political lens.
3:10:29
Are
3:10:34
there any memorable experiences or stories about any aspect of your
3:10:37
involvement with the Northwest Forest Plan that we have not mentioned?
3:10:41
Anything that you would like to talk about?
3:10:44
Any personal anecdotes, experiences with people, friendships, anything
3:10:50
that you want to talk about?
3:10:53
Certainly, lasting friendships as a result of that.
3:10:56
Mike Furness [U.S. Forest Service] was just a gem of a person to meet and
3:11:02
continue a long-term friendship with.
3:11:09
And I don't know if you've interviewed him or
3:11:11
-- ? I know who Mike is.
3:11:12
Yeah.
3:11:12
But I haven't interviewed him yet.
3:11:13
Just
3:11:18
to have that experience was in many ways the height of my career.
3:11:24
And to have it happen so early,
3:11:28
it just made such a lasting impression and just was a wonderful experience.
3:11:32
It's almost like having a platinum record your first record.
3:11:35
That's right.
3:11:35
Yes, how do you top it?
3:11:37
You don't, so…
3:11:39
It's like putting out Thriller as your first album or what-have-you.
3:11:42
Right?
3:11:43
Yeah, exactly.
3:11:51
I don't know how many of the people you've interviewed have been women?
3:11:55
I would assume not very many of them, because there weren't
3:12:00
that many women involved in the Northwest Forest Plan development.
3:12:06
That was certainly an interesting perspective for me.
3:12:10
I was going to ask you that too, next.
3:12:12
So, if you want to elaborate.
3:12:14
Okay.
3:12:14
I was going to ask you about gender equity, how it felt to enter the
3:12:19
“boy's club,” and how you were treated, if you want to elaborate on that?
3:12:26
Certainly.
3:12:26
There was definitely a lot of
3:12:29
respect.
3:12:30
I
3:12:33
never felt disrespected because I was a woman.
3:12:38
There's was being younger in my career and
3:12:47
not having the same
3:12:51
standing, and sorting that out.
3:12:55
Is that because I'm younger in my career?
3:12:56
Is it because I'm not male, a dominant silverback male?
3:13:08
That was always sort of in the background.
3:13:12
Maggie Shannon and Liz Garr definitely
3:13:20
played prominent roles, nowhere near the role the other principals played.
3:13:29
Maggie Shannon is
3:13:34
a political scientist.
3:13:35
Liz Garr worked for NOAA Fisheries.
3:13:35
She is an
3:13:50
attorney and had a
3:13:54
somewhat prominent role.
3:13:57
But it was definitely a boy's club.
3:14:00
There's just no two ways around that.
3:14:03
Did you ever or was there ever times where the guys
3:14:10
maybe, they told jokes that probably wouldn't be told today?
3:14:14
No, I never really heard that.
3:14:15
Everybody was pretty appropriate?
3:14:17
Yeah.
3:14:17
I never really felt that at all.
3:14:24
As I said, I think part of it was age.
3:14:27
Many of the guys were in a similar age cohort.
3:14:27
They knew each other, they were friends with each other, they had
3:14:31
similar experiences, they'd been through previous wars together.
3:14:34
Some you know - the Gang of Four.
3:14:40
That I think
3:14:44
created a bond that was difficult to move into, you know, to become one of the boys.
3:14:52
Because time and bonding is what it is?
3:14:54
Yeah, it is what it is.
3:14:56
And then, being a woman, there's always that.
3:15:03
Is it appropriate to be with a group of guys at 2:00 in the morning?
3:15:10
It's just sort of an odd
3:15:16
situation, situations can arise that can be odd that
3:15:22
it's not that--
3:15:26
I understand where you're going.
3:15:27
I think just the gender difference.
3:15:30
Not that anything untoward ever happened.
3:15:33
But, just the fact that people are working so intensely together, keeping long hours.
3:15:41
Looking from the outside, it was important to make sure no misperception
3:15:49
of anything untoward was happening.
3:15:56
This is a broader question, but I am interested in this.
3:15:58
How do you feel that gender politics have changed since you first entered
3:16:05
the Forest Service until you retired?
3:16:09
Definitely changed.
3:16:12
I think part of it is my field, fisheries.
3:16:20
Even Fish and Wildlife [U.S. Dept. of] , and wildlife [as discipline]
3:16:24
started being infiltrated by women much earlier than fisheries, I
3:16:29
think, as a result of an interest in
3:16:36
fuzzy, feathery, friendly things.
3:16:41
Ecology, the study of ecology, started bringing women into wildlife much
3:16:47
earlier than women started being involved in fisheries, because fisheries
3:16:52
was drawing not just from wildlife.
3:16:54
People are often drawn to fisheries and wildlife because
3:16:57
they liked to fish and hunt.
3:16:57
Back then, it was pretty much all hook and bullet [fishing/hunting] . The bullet
3:17:00
was being replaced by other concerns.
3:17:03
But when I got into fisheries, it was still hook.
3:17:06
You got into fisheries because you'd been a fisherman all your life.
3:17:10
Like Gordie Reeves?
3:17:12
Yeah, exactly.
3:17:13
I mean, he was fishing from the time he was a kid up in Canada,
3:17:16
and he told med all about that.
3:17:17
And that's still his thing.
3:17:18
He loves to fish.
3:17:19
He goes up to Montana and Alaska and that's his thing, yeah.
3:17:22
And so, there was a cultural thing, a boy's club, from
3:17:27
that bonding over fisheries.
3:17:30
Being a woman coming into that, it was
3:17:38
very difficult, particularly a woman from the South, where
3:17:41
expectations are not very high
3:17:46
that you're going to do anything professionally.
3:17:48
And if you are going to do something professionally, you are
3:17:51
going to be a teacher or a nurse.
3:17:53
What do your friends and family down South think about what you've done with your
3:17:56
career based on that whole cultural norm?
3:17:59
They have no idea.
3:18:00
I mean, they just think I'm just like this weirdo who lives out in Oregon.
3:18:04
And my dad, he introduced me once as, here's my daughter,
3:18:10
he was quite proud of me.
3:18:11
"Here's my daughter, who's in the environmental end of things."
3:18:15
That was how he introduced me.
3:18:17
So, that's about as much as he understood about my career and what I was doing.
3:18:21
Well, I guess that's better than it could have been.
3:18:24
Yeah, he usually referred to people he considered environmentalists
3:18:31
in much less kind terms.
3:18:37
But going back to your question about evolution in the Forest Service, I
3:18:44
would go to meetings early on and there would be twenty-five men and me.
3:18:50
It was an environment that just
3:18:57
presented a lot of challenges.
3:18:59
And although the men were always very kind and respectful and
3:19:10
willing to
3:19:13
be supportive, I don't think they really understood the challenges.
3:19:20
Having a very close mentor was not something that I ever really had.
3:19:27
Gordie was always a mentor.
3:19:28
Jim was always a mentor, but not in the way you can
3:19:36
have a mentor of the same gender – the ease that comes with that.
3:19:44
And because there weren't female role models for me, that was another
3:19:51
[matter] . The number of female role models I could count on one hand.
3:19:57
In your field?
3:19:59
Not in my field.
3:20:00
In general?
3:20:00
Just in general.
3:20:02
Professional, high-powered women role models.
3:20:04
That were in hydrology or geomorphology or fisheries.
3:20:10
So, those circles I ran in.
3:20:15
I think there were a lot more women botanists.
3:20:17
Botany has always been
3:20:25
a field that men weren't as interested in.
3:20:26
It was pansies and posies, and women were able to take leadership roles in a much
3:20:33
earlier stage and academic development.
3:20:38
And so, now you have a lot of women who are in
3:20:43
primary roles in academia.
3:20:45
But I never had a women professor at OSU in fisheries and wildlife.
3:20:55
Just from that perspective, and then once I got into fisheries
3:21:02
professionally, there was no difference.
3:21:06
I certainly wasn't in the “first wave,” but the “second wave” of women in
3:21:21
fisheries.
3:21:21
Looking at the Forest Service and efforts that the Forest Service and all federal
3:21:25
agencies, really have made to counter that
3:21:32
made it a lot more welcoming.
3:21:36
And the challenges, even though they're not overt, have taken away some of the
3:21:43
more subtle difficulties of being a woman in a predominately male field.
3:21:53
Well, you can see the differences even down at the Forestry Sciences Laboratory.
3:21:57
Oh, yeah.
3:21:59
Even from when I've started to become a professional in a
3:22:01
different industry, to now, but yeah, it's pretty much everywhere.
3:22:05
Yeah, I think much to their credit, Jim, Gordie and Fred Everest, as well.
3:22:13
He [Fred] is often overlooked in these conversations because he was
3:22:18
not directly involved in the Northwest Forest Plan, but he was in some of
3:22:23
the other science/policy efforts.
3:22:24
But concerning his role in the science and importance in the pioneering
3:22:31
science of fisheries, he was a giant.
3:22:38
He was always very supportive as well.
3:22:44
Now look at the Forest Service research program, and there are a lot of women.
3:22:47
[End of Audio Part]
3:22:47
[Start of Audio Part]
3:22:48
And the gender changes in that program that
3:22:52
I came up through, were because of the efforts of those three when
3:22:58
they were in leadership roles.
3:23:02
Now, I don't want to get essentialist about gender, but
3:23:05
I do want to ask this question.
3:23:07
And you've often seen it represented in good ways and bad ways in the past about,
3:23:13
is there an intrinsically maternalistic view of the world in nature, do you think?
3:23:21
And do you think that's just a cultural creation, versus paternalism?
3:23:24
Do you think that that makes a difference, or do you think that's a cultural
3:23:28
construction that does not apply?
3:23:32
I think it's a little of both.
3:23:37
I question whether or not if women had been involved in these
3:23:40
natural resource issues sooner,
3:23:50
if we might not have come to different points more quickly.
3:23:59
Just sort of utilitarian, non-systems thinking about mechanism in science, in
3:24:09
natural resource management, particularly.
3:24:12
I think we may have had a little bit different perspective, and that's
3:24:17
certainly come more into play more recently in how we look at ecosystems.
3:24:24
I don't know if that's just because our science has evolved, or science
3:24:29
evolved because women got more involved.
3:24:31
Who knows?
3:24:32
We'll never know.
3:24:32
Yes, but you
3:24:37
can't deconstruct the maternalism.
3:24:41
You can't restart history.
3:24:42
Regarding maternalism,
3:24:47
I definitely think that in general, women look at the world in a
3:24:49
fundamentally different way, and how
3:24:55
we do science is very different.
3:24:57
We tend to be more collaborative and interdisciplinary.
3:25:00
I think
3:25:03
how problems are looked at is changing.
3:25:05
People are more open to the nature of problems requiring much
3:25:08
more interdisciplinary views and more collaborative approaches
3:25:12
than they did thirty years ago.
3:25:21
I think women's more collaborative style has
3:25:26
influenced, and
3:25:31
certainly has benefitted the way
3:25:35
science is approached in natural resource management, more collaborative
3:25:39
decision-making processes, etc.
3:25:43
Talk to me a little about Gordie Reeves and then Jim Sedell.
3:25:45
I'd like you to just give me a little one or two paragraphs, a bit, about each one
3:25:52
of those people who kind are the closest senior people that you worked with,
3:25:56
especially on the forest plan itself.
3:25:58
Okay.
3:26:02
They couldn't have been more different, and they complemented each other so well.
3:26:06
Jim was a big idea guy, knew everybody, difficult to go from A to B, didn't
3:26:13
want to go from A to B. You couldn't understand what he said half the
3:26:16
time, but you knew it had to be brilliant, because Jim Sedell said it.
3:26:22
He was charmed that
3:26:29
were dedicated to him and just thought the world of him,
3:26:36
me included.
3:26:41
And
3:26:46
Gordie, one of
3:26:52
the least “whoo-whoo” people I ever knew.
3:26:55
Just very--
3:26:58
Define "woo-woo"?
3:26:59
Well, Jim was interested in spirituality and
3:27:07
in different ways of knowing.
3:27:10
Interested in personal development, getting together and having conversations.
3:27:15
Gordie's just not that way.
3:27:18
He wants to get together and have conversations about things, but not so
3:27:23
much about feelings, and Jim was much more
3:27:28
interested in relating to people.
3:27:31
I certainly wouldn't want anybody to think that Gordie's not a feeling
3:27:36
person, because he is very much so, but I think the level that he
3:27:42
interacts in general with the world is very different than the way Jim did.
3:27:47
Jim wore his heart on his sleeve, and Gordie's not like that.
3:27:50
And Gordie,
3:27:54
very much, takes a project from conception to finish, a much more linear person.
3:28:06
He and Jim just made an awesome team.
3:28:09
Gordie had the scientific chops to back up Jim's arm-waving [an
3:28:18
“idea-man.”] . In many ways, having the two of them to work with was
3:28:26
just a gift that I could never have—I'm going to start crying.
3:28:29
A gift that I could have never
3:28:30
-- Now, just
3:28:37
so you know, when I asked Gordie to talk about Jim, he cried.
3:28:41
Okay, yeah.
3:28:43
I mean, because, you know, he was very close.
3:28:45
Fred [Swanson] was, too, but yeah, he [Jim Sedell] was very loved.
3:28:49
Yeah.
3:28:50
So, that's very okay.
3:28:53
Even a tough guy like Gordie cried.
3:28:54
Yeah, okay.
3:28:56
And you know,
3:29:00
I feel very close to Gordie and he's always been sort of like a big brother.
3:29:05
I
3:29:09
get it.
3:29:09
Yeah.
3:29:11
One of my big regrets since I came on to the project with the Andrews,
3:29:16
and now with all these oral histories and other work I'm doing, is I
3:29:19
started right after Jim got sick.
3:29:24
It was before he died, but I just never got a chance to meet him because
3:29:28
he got sick, and it was, it was pancreatic cancer, so it was so fast.
3:29:32
[Sedell was stricken with the cancer and died in]
3:29:34
. Yeah.
3:29:34
Well, for all of us, it was.
3:29:37
So, anyway, it's okay.
3:29:41
[Break in audio] And you did say that being involved with the forest plan
3:29:46
was the highlight of your career.
3:29:48
Just elaborate a little more on that as kind of a last answer?
3:29:54
Just
3:29:57
having
3:30:04
the opportunity to feel like I really contributed something
3:30:08
that was meaningful, lasting, and
3:30:17
I think that's the main thing.
3:30:20
I think the research that I've done has all been very incremental.
3:30:25
I enjoyed it.
3:30:26
It was good work.
3:30:31
It's not paradigm-shifting by any means.
3:30:35
But, in some ways, I feel like this was.
3:30:38
The forest plan [NWFP] in a way was at least an attempt to shift paradigms.
3:30:41
Right, and having the opportunity to be involved with that just
3:30:50
provided so much
3:30:53
purpose, and then shaped my career; how I looked at science, how I
3:31:00
looked at research, and how I looked at the role of science in society.
3:31:08
So,
3:31:10
it didn't necessarily form those opinions, but it certainly shaped
3:31:15
those opinions as I went forward.
3:31:18
Very good.
3:31:21
I think that wraps it up, Kelly.
3:31:24
And I want to thank you for spending the whole afternoon with me in your home
3:31:28
here in Corvallis, and enlightened me on your role in the Northwest Forest Plan.
3:31:32
Thank you.
3:31:33
Well, you're welcome.
3:31:34
Thank you, it's been quite a journey.
3:31:37
All right, thank you.
