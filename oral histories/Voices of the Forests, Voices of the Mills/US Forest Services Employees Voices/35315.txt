00:02
Good morning.
00:02
This is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State University.
00:07
I am here in the home of Terry Cryer, Trades Maintenance II, or, actually,
00:15
Jack-Of-All-Trades—Maintenance Technician, Construction Worker,
00:18
and Artist extraordinaire at the Andrews Experimental Forest.
00:18
We are
00:23
here today in Terry’s home at the Andrews Forest to do an oral
00:26
history interview that is part of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest
00:30
Oral History Project, Phase II.
00:33
Terry is the first interview in the second group that we’re doing for
00:36
this project, which will eventually be transcribed and included in one or two
00:42
archives for preservation purposes but also for people to learn about this
00:47
important scientific research site.
00:50
Anyway, Terry, I’m really excited to do this.
00:52
Thank you for letting me come into your home.
00:54
Good morning.
00:55
Good morning.
00:55
Alright.
00:56
Very good.
00:57
We’re going to get going here, and these interviews are free-flowing.
01:02
I have questions, but there is no script.
01:04
You just talk and there’s no report card.
01:08
Just go for it.
01:11
I will start the same way.
01:13
Where were you born and raised and follow that up with a little bit
01:16
of a biographical sketch of your life, especially your early years.
01:20
Right.
01:22
I was born and raised in southwest Louisiana.
01:27
What was the name of the town?
01:28
Oh, Sulphur, Louisiana.
01:30
Sulphur?
01:31
Sulphur, yeah.
01:32
Sulphur.
01:32
Now, if I remember you told me before that’s about 10 miles
01:36
outside of Lake Charles, correct?
01:37
Yep, yep.
01:38
On the west side of Lake Charles.
01:40
Twenty miles from Texas border; 30 miles from the gulf coast.
01:44
You’re pretty close to Beaumont, Texas, on the other side.
01:46
Oh, yeah.
01:46
Okay, right.
01:48
You probably knew some people that got hit by hurricane
01:50
Harvey and all that rain, huh?
01:52
Not really.
01:53
Most of our relatives live in Houston, Texas.
01:58
They got hit pretty good, too, but not like some of the other ones, like
02:02
Texas City, Port Arthur, and Sulphur was only 25 miles from where they got
02:09
hit hard, but Sulphur didn’t get it.
02:12
They got hit, but not like they did.
02:15
Fifty inches of rain will mess up your plants [laughs]
02:19
. Yeah, oh yeah.
02:21
Anyway, tell me about growing up in Sulphur and what did you do
02:27
and what were the roots of how you came to be who you are in terms of
02:31
whatever: your affinity for technical things and mechanical things.
02:36
Of course, even your artistic love that you’ve developed.
02:39
Some of that I think I was born with: the mechanical ability,
02:45
I was born with.
02:47
My dad was a good teacher on the mechanical side because he was
02:51
also a mechanical kind of person.
02:54
Was he a shop teacher or something?
02:56
No, he was just on the service station and trucking business on the side.
03:03
One of those guys that could fix anything, right?
03:04
He was a jack-of-all-trades, yeah.
03:04
He could fix anything.
03:05
He was
03:08
good at it.
03:08
You probably learned from an early time of how to make do and fix things—
03:14
Yep.
03:14
Low budget.
03:14
Because probably your first job was in the shop, correct?
03:19
Yep.
03:19
Poor income.
03:20
It was always a fight to make ends meet.
03:24
Yeah, I got a lot of good training on how to pull things out of the
03:28
trash and rebuild it [laughs]
03:31
. Perfect training for your future job here, right?
03:33
Oh, yeah.
03:34
Especially in the early years before you had the nice facilities, right?
03:37
Oh yeah, we worked on a midnight budget many years [laughs]
03:40
. I bet you did, and we’ll talk about specifics of that later.
03:46
Describe Sulphur.
03:48
Sulphur—small town.
03:51
Not a lot of people.
03:53
Mixed.
03:54
You had Cajuns, you had colored folk, white folk, quite a mixture.
04:01
They were all integrated with each other.
04:03
We never had any racial kind of stuff in my hometown.
04:08
There were a few people that were kind of bigots, but basically, nah.
04:16
It was a good place to grow up, I think.
04:20
How many people in Sulphur, approximately?
04:21
Even get in trouble the cops knew my dad and all of them.
04:26
We’d just haul him in and call Mr. Cryer and he’ll take care of it.
04:30
¬¬¬CC [Terry’s sister]: I’d say it’s a God-fearing, church-going family.
04:34
God-fearing, church-going?
04:34
Yeah.
04:36
What church did you got to when you were young?
04:38
Real conservative.
04:39
Baptist.
04:42
All of it Baptist church.
04:43
All of it Baptist church.
04:43
Southern Baptist?
04:44
Yes.
04:45
Yeah, Southern Baptist.
04:46
Yeah.
04:47
Because I grew up American Baptist, which is, I used to call it the mellow,
04:50
milk toast version of Baptists [laughs]
04:52
. Right [laughs] . No this was more of the hard core, strict Baptist.
05:00
Don’t dance except on—well, never [laughs]
05:05
. [Laughs] Right.
05:06
The old joke how do you tell the difference between
05:08
a Baptist and a Catholic?
05:10
Tell me.
05:11
A Catholic walks into the front door of the bar and a Baptist
05:14
walks in the backside of the door.
05:16
The backdoor.
05:17
Or, the backdoor of the bar.
05:19
Yeah.
05:23
The hard rock Southern Baptist, you didn’t walk into of the doors.
05:28
They were pretty strict.
05:29
Yeah, my church was a little different than that.
05:34
Anyway, so tell me about just your working with your dad in the shop
05:41
and the whole mechanical thing.
05:43
A little more detail about—give me some anecdotes about doing that.
05:46
He’d work pretty early at the service station.
05:48
Really?
05:49
I was probably 10 years old when I started putting in time at the service
05:54
station, evenings and weekends, waiting on people and it didn’t take long how
06:02
to treat people politically correct, professional courtesy comes first.
06:07
You come last.
06:10
The customer’s always right.
06:11
The customer’s always right.
06:13
Oh yeah.
06:13
My dad was really big on that.
06:16
It’s amazing how you can be a good business—whether it’s a restaurant,
06:20
or what have you—and you’ll carry that reputation forever, and
06:24
then there’s one bad incident.
06:26
That thing will color your reputation.
06:28
Yep.
06:29
It’s a good reason why even though you got to bite your tongue sometimes
06:33
when you’re dealing with difficult customers, it usually works out in
06:36
terms of good business practice.
06:39
Most of my trouble was to hold back laughing.
06:43
[Laughs]
06:43
. You’d get some pretty hilarious customers coming in.
06:47
Really?
06:48
Oh yeah.
06:49
I remember one of our regular customers was an old black fella and his wife
06:56
and he would come in once a week on the weekend with her and his hound dog.
07:03
His wife was always in the backseat and the hound dog
07:07
was in the front seat [laughs]
07:10
. Really.
07:10
That’s just the way it was.
07:12
So, the hound dog was in the front?
07:13
I wanted to laugh so much.
07:15
I don’t know where I want to go with that, you know?
07:19
My dad said down in that country a ‘coon dog’s more important than the wife.
07:27
That’s true—the hunting.
07:27
I’ll tell you what in the university environment that I live in I would
07:31
never even say something close to that [laughs] , even as a joke.
07:39
The women’s right would be all over you.
07:39
Oh yeah.
07:40
Don’t you know.
07:42
But that was that era.
07:43
You
07:48
got to have a good wife, but you have to have a good hunting dog, too.
07:53
So, do you hunt a lot?
07:55
I did.
07:56
My dad was an avid hunter and fisherman and he took me—almost every
08:03
time he went he took me with him.
08:05
What did he like to hunt?
08:09
I quit hunting when I got back from Vietnam.
08:13
I lost my interest in hunting.
08:14
No, but I mean, your father—
08:16
As a kid, mostly small game.
08:20
Squirrel, beaver.
08:20
Squirrel, ‘coon, rabbit.
08:23
Mostly squirrel.
08:24
Deer.
08:25
Deer, yep.
08:27
I bet fishing was big down there, though, right?
08:29
Oh yeah.
08:30
Oh yeah, that was the, and it was cheaper.
08:32
Well and you were by so much water down there.
08:35
Because there’s Lake Charles, which is a big lake.
08:37
Then there’s the gulf and then everything else.
08:41
But mostly the tributaries.
08:43
That’s where all the best fishing is, the Sabine Reserve.
08:46
They
08:49
have a lot of reserve fishing areas.
08:51
Bass?
08:52
Oh yeah.
08:53
Bass up the ying-yang.
08:55
Yeah.
08:55
Big bass.
08:57
Good eatin’ bass.
08:59
Hard fightin’ bass, oh yeah.
09:01
I bet a lot of the meals you had when you were growing up were
09:04
fish that you caught, right?
09:05
Oh yeah.
09:07
Dad was big on that, too.
09:09
If you catch it, you’re going to eat it.
09:11
There was no waste in our house.
09:15
What year were you born in, Terry?
09:16
1949.
09:18
1949—you mentioned earlier about Vietnam and you mentioned just a
09:22
minute ago and your aversion to, I take it was because of what happened
09:26
over there you weren’t so excited about using firearms anymore, correct?
09:30
Yeah, pretty much.
09:30
I mean that’s not an atypical response.
09:36
Mm-hmm.
09:36
To being in a war zone.
09:38
How
09:43
old were you when you got drafted?
09:44
Or did you join up?
09:46
No, I was interested.
09:51
We got picked up for the fourth time by the sheriff in Shreveport, Louisiana.
09:56
Oh, so it’s one of those things.
09:57
Yeah, me and my—
09:59
Where you basically said, lesser sentence if you go to war [laughs]
10:00
. Yeah
10:04
[laughs]
10:04
. No, seriously?
10:07
The fourth time we walked down the hallway the door to the sheriff’s
10:11
office was open and he saw us, me and my two buddies, and he says do
10:18
not even book up, just lock them up I’ll deal with them in the morning.
10:24
So, he did.
10:25
They didn’t have to book us.
10:27
We were already on the books.
10:30
They locked us up and the next day he sat us down and he said,
10:33
okay boys, this is enough.
10:36
Here’s your option, you got two options: prison.
10:42
I think he was exaggerating a little, but anyway that was his
10:46
words, prison or join the Army.
10:49
You were basically doing too much hell raising, right?
10:51
Yeah.
10:52
You don’t have to fill in the gaps [laughs]
10:54
. Okay.
10:55
I get it.
10:55
[Laughs] So we said okay, yes sir, we’ll take the Army.
10:57
So, he said okay
11:01
you call up somebody that can come get you that can take you home, a responsible
11:06
adult, and we’ll write you off.
11:10
So, we called my folks and Dad didn’t want nothing to do with it, so Momma
11:15
volunteered to come up to Shreveport and pick us up and take us all home.
11:19
The day I got home my draft notice was in the mail.
11:25
You got drafted before you joined up?
11:27
No, I didn’t get drafted.
11:30
Oh, your draft notice.
11:31
Yeah, I got the draft notice.
11:33
So, you actually went and joined.
11:34
My number has been picked.
11:36
But you went and joined before that process happened, correct?
11:39
That’s right.
11:40
Oh, okay.
11:41
Everybody in my family were all war heroes, you know?
11:44
And they said it can go hard on you if you let them draft you, so you should join.
11:49
That’d be the best thing to do.
11:51
Because it might give you an option of what branch you—
11:53
Yeah, it’d give you the option of more formal training and all that
11:58
kind of, which, was all a lie.
12:02
At that time, they were putting everybody where they wanted them [laughs] . Because
12:07
I put in for Heavy Equipment Operator.
12:09
That was my own training already.
12:12
I had experience.
12:15
In the Ken Burns movie there’s a lot of profound, historically
12:18
documented examples of all the lies that the government told the people
12:23
and the soldiers and the generals.
12:24
To everybody, that’s right [laughs]
12:26
. Anyway, when I tell you that premise before you actually watch
12:29
the series you would say that does not surprise me, correct?
12:33
Exactly.
12:34
Yep.
12:35
But when you went in you were probably, even though you were a
12:39
hell raiser, you were probably a good red-white-and-blue American boy, right?
12:42
Oh yeah.
12:43
You had that kind of attitude, right?
12:44
Oh, yeah.
12:44
I didn’t know what drugs was except what you get at the drug store.
12:49
We did our share of drinking.
12:54
We were good ol’ all-American, blue-blood boys.
13:01
Where did you go to basic?
13:01
We didn’t really know what we were doing.
13:05
I went to basic training in Ft. Polk, Louisiana.
13:09
So close to home, then, huh?
13:10
Yep.
13:13
Got to come home after basics, anyway.
13:16
I got to come home on weekends.
13:17
That was kind of nice.
13:21
Now, I don’t know how traumatic that may have been—and you can or cannot
13:27
talk about that, but you want to tell me a little bit about Vietnam, or not?
13:31
That’s up to you.
13:32
The biggest thing for me was the whole thing was like being in a dream.
13:37
Really?
13:38
When I got my orders to ship out my first stop was Ft. Ord, California.
13:46
I think that was in San Diego.
13:49
Then we flew to Hawaii and then from Hawaii to Vietnam and
13:55
Saigon, where they dropped us off.
13:59
Then we got divvied up to the different to the different outfits we were assigned to.
14:04
That whole thing was like a foggy dream.
14:06
Just like being in a fog.
14:10
It
14:13
never felt real, you know?
14:17
I got introduced to drugs while I was over there.
14:20
You and a whole lot of other guys.
14:22
I locked in with the hippie side of the crowd.
14:24
You were either a hippie or a cowboy.
14:30
The cowboys had one corner of the barracks and the hippies had
14:33
the other corner of the barracks.
14:35
There was a crossover, of course.
14:39
You had country and western music over there and you had rock-n-roll over here.
14:45
Yeah.
14:47
That’s the way that went.
14:49
Right.
14:50
It didn’t take me long to fit in with the hippie crowd.
14:54
I just liked their mannerisms better, I guess.
14:58
I got into everything over there.
15:00
It was cheap.
15:00
Now we know the true origin of your artistic genius, right?
15:04
[Laughs]
15:06
Yeah, right [Laughs]
15:07
. Go on with that.
15:08
Sorry.
15:08
Anyway,
15:11
I saw a lot of action.
15:12
I’m not going to go into any details on all that.
15:14
Don’t.
15:14
No, it’s okay.
15:16
That’s while I premised the subject, because a lot of people
15:20
it’s kind of hard to talk about.
15:22
Our outfit covered a lot of territory.
15:26
Most of the time we were jungle patrol, fire-based duty,
15:31
different stuff like that.
15:33
When we were in the rear, which wasn’t very often, we had to do
15:37
our share of perimeter guard duty.
15:42
When fourth division pulled out, my time wasn’t up, so the rest of us were shipped
15:49
up to the Americal Division in Chu Lai.
15:52
I
15:57
saw probably a little more action in Chu Lai area.
16:02
It was the same thing,
16:05
same scenario: we were jungle patrol, fire-based duty, stuff like that.
16:13
Saw a lot of bad stuff.
16:15
Did
16:19
you do one tour over there?
16:21
Yep, one tour.
16:22
That was what, 9 months or a year rotation?
16:24
Thirteen months.
16:25
Thirteen months.
16:26
Okay.
16:27
Because of that overlap thing, you know, one division pulling
16:30
out and shipped to the other one.
16:34
I wasn’t paying attention anyway.
16:37
I ended up 13 months and was shipped home.
16:41
You where there what year to what year?
16:43
From ’69 to ’71.
16:46
Okay, so it was still really bad.
16:49
That was before it started to wind down.
16:49
It was supposed to have started winding down in ’69.
16:56
The last Tet Offensive was in ’68.
16:59
In ’68.
16:59
That was the one that made everybody realize that we’re not
17:02
probably going to win this war.
17:04
Exactly.
17:04
Which was a deluded notion, because it was a civil war, really.
17:09
Yeah.
17:10
No need to go into war strategies and military history but it was a—we
17:16
were trying to fight that war like we did the last war before that:
17:20
Korea but especially World War II.
17:21
Right.
17:23
It’s usually the way that—if you look at military history—generals, like World
17:28
War I they tried to fight that war like they had the Chivalric Wars of the 19th
17:33
century, but unfortunately, they were facing water-cooled machine guns and
17:38
howitzers that were much more efficient than they had the previous century.
17:42
It wasn’t the Charge of the Light Brigade, which they still
17:44
got killed, but basically that.
17:47
Usually you find there’s a lag effect.
17:49
Unfortunately, the grunts, you guys, are the ones that pay the price.
17:53
Exactly.
17:55
When you came back were you conflicted?
17:58
I
18:02
was totally messed up.
18:03
That puts it mildly.
18:04
I was completely gone.
18:07
Was that because of drugs or just the whole trauma of the experience, or both?
18:10
It was a mix of all of it.
18:12
The drugs and the trauma—the whole business.
18:18
Like I said it was like being in a foggy dream and then when I got back to state
18:23
side it was still like a foggy dream.
18:26
I wasn’t back to reality yet.
18:29
How long did it take you to feel okay again?
18:34
He still doesn’t.
18:36
That’s Cathy, Terry’s sister in the background.
18:38
Just for the record.
18:40
She said he still isn’t okay.
18:42
That’s a joke, by the way.
18:44
Yes.
18:44
It’s said with a lot of love.
18:46
[Laughs]
18:48
. The real turn-around was when I met my wife, the real opener for me,
18:53
because she could see the darkness in me that I was caught up in.
18:59
She helped me to gradually walk out of that darkness.
19:06
Return from the “jungle” so to speak, right?
19:08
Yeah, exactly.
19:09
You were in the form of a dark mental jungle, right?
19:12
Yep.
19:14
That’s a good metaphor to describe how a lot of those guys came back.
19:18
They would literally dream of the jungle and the darkness and the wetness.
19:23
Oh man, oh yeah.
19:24
The flashbacks.
19:27
Yeah,
19:29
that’s why I went AWOL shortly after state side.
19:33
When you came back you went AWOL for a while, because you still
19:36
had to serve out your time, right?
19:38
Yeah.
19:39
My time wasn’t up yet so I was supposed to finish serving in Ft. Riley, Kansas,
19:44
and after, I don’t remember, it wasn’t very long, six weeks or so I went AWOL.
19:50
I just walked away.
19:52
I went drifting and that’s how I met my wife.
19:57
I met her at a state park.
20:01
Tell me about that a little bit.
20:02
I was running from what I understood of life and she was running from it, too.
20:09
We connected.
20:11
You met at a state park?
20:13
Yep.
20:13
You remember the state park’s name?
20:15
You must.
20:15
Sam Houston State Park, Houston, Texas.
20:19
Very cool.
20:20
Evening campfire.
20:22
Her and her daughter were at an evening campfire.
20:24
Me and my cousin, he had decided to go AWOL, too [laughs] . It always
20:30
takes two or more, doesn’t it?
20:31
That’s true.
20:35
He met them first.
20:37
He was out for an evening walk and he came back and said,
20:41
Terry, you got to come with me.
20:42
This is the greatest gal you were ever meet.
20:47
It was my future wife.
20:50
What was her name?
20:50
Ginger.
20:50
She was a card reader at the time.
20:52
What was her name?
20:53
Ginger.
20:54
That was her nickname.
20:55
Her real name is Virginia.
20:58
She was a tarot card reader?
21:00
No, the other kind.
21:02
What do you call it?
21:05
The could read just like palm reading.
21:07
Oh, she had—
21:07
They
21:11
could read your history—
21:12
She had ESP.
21:12
With a pack of cards.
21:13
That’s a tarot card.
21:13
No, a pack of reading cards.
21:14
Okay.
21:19
That’s a whole different thing, but boy I tell you what.
21:21
She had some help from somebody because—
21:24
She figured you out, huh?
21:25
She had him figured out.
21:28
Then he took me over there and in two minutes she had me figured
21:32
out and then she knew exactly where we were going from there.
21:37
It turned out we did go to there from there [laughs]
21:41
. Do you remember the famous song by the group Rainbow
21:44
called “Tarot Woman?” [Laughs]
21:47
. Yeah, exactly.
21:50
About that same time.
21:51
The early ‘70s.
21:55
You’re with Ginger and she, basically she saved you, didn’t she?
21:59
She did.
22:01
She helped me to get turned around.
22:03
Went and got a real job.
22:05
Never changed my name.
22:06
I’m still AWOL.
22:08
Never changed my name, nothing.
22:10
I never tried to hide.
22:11
I just didn’t care.
22:12
You never got reprimanded or in trouble for all that?
22:16
When they came looking for me four years later, they finally pulled up my number.
22:22
Our dad.
22:23
This is Cathy.
22:25
She’s going to enter the conversation now.
22:27
Cathy, what’s your last name?
22:28
Cryer.
22:28
Oh, it’s Cryer, also.
22:28
Never married.
22:29
I just wanted to make sure for the record, for the transcription so.
22:33
Tell me what you’re going to say.
22:34
He was missing.
22:35
When he went AWOL our family went into panic mode.
22:38
My dad even hired the FBI and everybody to find him.
22:43
I don’t know how many years, Terry, do you know?
22:45
Before they found you?
22:46
Four years.
22:47
Four He was up here, and it was all—
22:49
It was 1974.
22:51
So, Ginger, you came up here with her, then?
22:53
Mm-hmm.
22:54
She saved you, but your family still didn’t know where you were.
22:58
No.
22:58
Right, yeah.
22:59
Cathy, you guys must have been freaked out.
23:01
Yeah, I was only—let’s see, I was like 11, 12, 13—around there.
23:05
Because you’re a little younger than Terry.
23:06
Right.
23:06
Ten years younger.
23:08
Baby sister.
23:09
So, that would tell the story of how he found—they kind of knew he
23:13
was in this area, in Eugene area.
23:16
He was driving around.
23:17
He was looking at mechanic shops, because he thought he’d be working
23:19
on cars like he did as a boy.
23:22
Got turned around, I think the story went, went up a hill.
23:26
They were doing construction work.
23:28
He drove up there to go ask those guys, hey, where am I?
23:31
By the way I have this picture of my son I’m looking for.
23:34
They went, he’s here.
23:35
He’s right up there working on the building.
23:38
Yep.
23:38
Dad walks in, Terry says—you tell the rest.
23:44
I didn’t see him.
23:45
I was cleaning paintbrushes at a kitchen sink.
23:49
This was in Eugene?
23:50
Yeah, South Hills of Eugene.
23:52
We were building apartments.
23:54
Do you remember where it was?
23:56
South Eugene Hills.
23:57
That’s all I remember [chuckles]
23:58
. No, because that’s where I grew up.
23:59
I was there in high school, actually, in my period of trouble.
24:01
Well,
24:04
you know how Willamette Street goes on and starts up the hill?
24:07
Yeah.
24:08
Well, it’s the first drive—
24:10
Way up on the hill there?
24:11
As soon as you start up the hill, the first driveway to the right goes up
24:14
to a bunch of high-rise apartments.
24:16
Yeah, the ones above that cemetery there, right?
24:18
Yeah.
24:19
I built those.
24:20
My first kegger party was right
24:26
there [laughs]
24:27
. [Laughs]
24:27
. [Laughs]
24:27
. Before they built them.
24:27
The year before: ’73.
24:28
Okay.
24:28
Alright.
24:29
Wow.
24:30
This is for the record.
24:31
I don’t care because it’s funny.
24:37
I was washing paintbrushes at the kitchen sink.
24:40
Looking out the window and I saw a shadow go by the window.
24:46
I didn’t even see him, but I saw the shadow and I knew that’s who it was.
24:50
A big shadow.
24:50
I knew it was Dad.
24:51
You couldn’t miss this big guy.
24:53
Was he a big guy?
24:54
Big guy.
24:56
What was his name?
24:57
Lloyd J. Cryer.
24:58
Lloyd J. Cryer.
25:01
Yeah, and here he comes and in he walks.
25:05
Yep.
25:07
He said I had to come find you.
25:09
I got my life turned around I wanted to get straight with you.
25:14
We spent some time together.
25:15
That must have been a wonderful reunion.
25:16
He met my wife.
25:18
That must have been a wonderful reunion, huh?
25:20
It was scary.
25:22
Oh, scary?
25:22
Really?
25:22
Yeah.
25:23
So, it was wonderful, but—
25:25
Well, the history with me and my dad was that he kicked me out of the house
25:30
when I was 17 because I went and got my own job instead of working for him.
25:37
He didn’t really like that.
25:39
Gotcha.
25:39
I understand that.
25:41
He threw a 20-dollar bill at me and said if you don’t need
25:46
my job you don’t need my house.
25:48
Go.
25:49
So, go I went.
25:51
It was how many years—this was 10 years later?
25:55
Even then during my training
26:02
at Ft. Polk I’d come home on the weekends and it wasn’t a healthy relationship.
26:08
It was pretty rough.
26:11
He wouldn’t even acknowledge my existence when I got my orders to go to Vietnam.
26:17
Momma said it was because he was just upset because I had to go,
26:21
and he wouldn’t even talk to me.
26:24
Well, people process fear in many different ways.
26:27
Yeah, of course at that time young and dumb I didn’t know.
26:31
I
26:34
guess that’s it.
26:35
He wrote me off and that’s the end of that.
26:39
Why is it that life gives us these old bodies, but we have the
26:43
wisdom that we have now, but back then we had zero or very little?
26:49
Yeah, that’s right.
26:49
Zero brain and 100% on the body.
26:52
That just is backwards [laughs]
26:54
. I know.
26:54
It’s not fair.
26:55
It ain’t.
26:59
Here’s you an answer—because of the life you went through, that’s
27:01
where you got your wisdom from.
27:03
Absolutely.
27:04
I guess so, yeah, that’s the way it works.
27:06
You gain that wisdom from your experiences.
27:08
If you are the kind of person and have the belief system but also
27:13
the psychological makeup to learn.
27:16
Yes.
27:16
Yeah.
27:16
Because a lot of people go the other way.
27:18
Right.
27:19
They become bitter and resentful and closed and they don’t learn.
27:22
Right.
27:23
At least in what I would call a healthy way.
27:25
Exactly.
27:25
I agree.
27:25
Yeah.
27:26
You know.
27:27
Anyway,
27:32
that’s enough on that history.
27:33
You know, that’s cool.
27:34
A broken relation.
27:34
So,
27:36
you’re connected with your family but you’re in Eugene still.
27:39
With Ginger, right?
27:40
Yep.
27:40
And when they come looking after Dad’s visit with us, he went back to Louisiana
27:46
and then the FBI started looking for me.
27:50
First, they went to their house in Louisiana.
27:53
Where is he?
27:54
And they wouldn’t tell.
27:55
Dad knew.
27:57
The whole family knew where I was, but they wouldn't tell them.
28:00
You get out of here.
28:01
We don’t know where he’s at.
28:03
Because they were afraid you’d have some big confrontation, right?
28:06
Right.
28:07
He called me and told me, gave me a heads up.
28:12
He called my boss, because I didn’t have a phone at the time.
28:15
But he called my boss and gave him a heads up that they were looking for me.
28:20
You were working for a construction crew, right?
28:22
Or, a painting crew?
28:24
Actually, it was no longer.
28:25
It was the owners of the apartment.
28:28
I was one of the last ones there.
28:30
They hired me to do all the finalization.
28:33
You did the punch lists?
28:34
I did the punch lists, right?
28:38
That’s a pretty big complex.
28:39
So that’s quite a bit of work.
28:40
That was a big job.
28:42
I was in hog heaven.
28:45
Anyway, the boss called me in and says your dad called and
28:49
said the FBI’s looking for you.
28:51
They don’t’ know where you’re at.
28:53
They said they actually came in and talked to me and I told them you weren’t here.
29:00
I didn’t know where you were.
29:02
The last he had known I was gone to a dentist, but I didn’t say what dentist.
29:09
Which, I actually was.
29:10
I had to get a tooth pulled.
29:11
It was killing me.
29:13
Back then you didn’t fix teeth.
29:17
You pulled them.
29:18
Back in those days.
29:19
Anyway, I got back from the dentist and that’s when he told me about.
29:25
He said, yeah, they’re after you and they’re not far behind.
29:29
He said but here’s what I think you should do.
29:32
You don’t have to.
29:34
I’m going to give you this option: I’ll buy you a plane ticked
29:37
to Canada right now if you and your wife want to just get away.
29:43
Or, you can turn yourself in.
29:46
I have a lawyer.
29:47
We’ll hook up with my lawyer.
29:49
We’ll turn you in.
29:51
This was about the AWOL thing, right?
29:52
Uh-huh.
29:53
We’ll turn you in on our ground.
29:56
Okay.
29:57
So, I said okay.
29:58
I’ll talk to my wife about it, and we’ll see.
30:01
I called up my wife and said hey Babe.
30:04
I may not make it home.
30:05
I’m in town right now.
30:07
The FBI’s hot on my trial.
30:11
We talked about it and she said, yeah, let’s go ahead and fix it.
30:16
Get it over with.
30:17
Just in the short version, how did that get resolved?
30:20
I
30:23
had my choice when they took me up to Ft. Louis how I wanted to approach
30:31
the situation and I chose what they call Article XIII, which is you write
30:37
your side of the story, submit it to a board for interview, and then they
30:44
decide what kind of discharge you get or prison sentence or whatever.
30:49
They gave me a discharge.
30:51
They reviewed my wrote up and liked it and they agreed you’re
30:59
okay.
30:59
You’re not a bad-bad guy.
31:02
I bet you they had hundreds of thousands of such soldiers who were so messed up
31:06
by Vietnam that they had some version of that reaction, wouldn’t you say?
31:12
Oh yeah.
31:15
In fact, I was in—what do you call it?—a halfway house.
31:18
I wasn’t in jail.
31:19
I was just in a fenced-in yard.
31:21
You did have to kind of do some serve something?
31:24
Yeah, I served probably about 4 months while they processed
31:28
the whole thing, you know.
31:29
Okay, so you were up in Ft. Louis, then?
31:31
Yeah.
31:34
I still remember going to Ft. Louis in—what’s the, there’s an
31:37
Air Force base up there, too?
31:40
Yeah, Sea-Tack.
31:41
But I remember going to Ft. Louis when I was a kid and that was the
31:42
first time I visited a military base.
31:42
We were going to Victoria, Canada, when I was 8 or 9, and
31:42
I remember going into Ft. Louis
31:46
and all
31:51
the tanks and there was all this stuff around.
31:54
Canons and—
31:56
I just remembered that when I was just a little kid and then
31:58
we went up to Victoria, Canada.
32:02
That’s how we got it resolved.
32:04
They gave me a general discharge with full benefits.
32:08
Oh, that’s good.
32:10
So, you got all the vet stuff that you need?
32:13
I could, if I chose to go there.
32:14
Well, if you chose, yeah.
32:16
But I could.
32:18
Anyway, we got that squared away and the rest is history.
32:24
Now, when did the artistic thing really start?
32:27
I mean was that here or—
32:29
No, no.
32:31
Well, my first attempts when I got back from Vietnam I was with my wife—
32:36
That’s what I’m asking—you’re married to a kind of a unique individual who
32:41
was a mystical, creative person, right?
32:44
Yep.
32:45
That might have led you in a different cultural direction, is what I’m saying.
32:47
And it did.
32:49
Because I tried painting.
32:51
I’d been drawing pictures and painting since I was a kid.
32:55
Okay, so you were doing that.
32:56
But all my stuff was dark, and she used to comment about,
33:00
you know, everything’s dark.
33:03
Everything you paint.
33:04
Everything you draw is dark.
33:08
So, I kind of closed to door on it, you know?
33:11
Okay.
33:13
We got into rock collecting and driftwood hunting and building things with wood.
33:19
I got involved with that.
33:20
You had an artisan, craftsman thing that you were
33:25
developing through the lens of a child or a young adolescent.
33:30
Right.
33:33
I used to get a lot of compliments on my pencil sketches when
33:36
I was a little, bitty fella.
33:38
You had the mechanical ability that obviously was more developed because
33:42
of working with your father in the shop, but you had an artistic affinity
33:46
and love that just wasn’t quite as developed but it was right there, too?
33:49
Yeah.
33:53
And I went through work in the construction trade in ’72.
33:58
And that was up here?
33:59
And started building houses.
34:01
Actually, yeah it did start up here.
34:03
It was in our first visit up here in ’71 which was just odd jobs, just
34:09
picking up whatever I could get.
34:12
We’d live here for a while and then go back to Houston, Texas.
34:17
I hooked up with her brother-in-law was
34:23
a foreman for custom home construction and they’d put me to work.
34:28
In Houston, or here?
34:29
Houston.
34:30
That was in Houston, Texas.
34:33
That’s where I got my initial training of building houses was with them.
34:41
I put back and forth between Oregon and Houston, we were kind of like gypsies.
34:47
We never stayed in one place very long.
34:50
Was Ginger from up here?
34:51
No, she’s a San Antonian gal.
34:53
She’s from right down there.
34:55
She’s a Texas gal.
34:58
It was natural for us to, if things didn’t work good, we’d go back to Houston.
35:03
Then we’d get tired of Houston and come back to Oregon.
35:06
We first got introduced to Oregon in ’71.
35:09
The hippies in Lake Tahoe we were camping out one night and decided to
35:15
visit with a bunch of hippies around a campfire and they were: what?
35:19
You’ve never been to Oregon?
35:21
Oh, you guys got to go to Oregon.
35:24
You’ll love Oregon.
35:25
I was like okay.
35:27
We ain’t doing nothing else.
35:28
Let’s go check it out [chuckles] . Of course, we got up here
35:32
and fell in love with Oregon.
35:37
We probably, back and forth, till
35:42
’74 trying to make it work.
35:44
Trying to make it work permanent.
35:46
Here?
35:46
But you had to go back for work reasons or whatever, right?
35:48
Yep.
35:51
Finally, in ’74 I had enough experience under my belt to make enough money
35:58
to, well, make a good living.
36:01
We were making a good living.
36:03
Plus, my wife was, a lot of gypsy blood.
36:08
She didn’t like settling down for very long, anyway.
36:12
She loved to travel.
36:15
But,
36:18
in ’74 we made a much stronger go of it in Oregon and we began to spend more and
36:23
more time here as opposed to elsewhere.
36:26
For many years after that we would put maybe 8 months here
36:33
and various places down south.
36:36
We spent some time in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, a little bit
36:44
in Louisiana, but mostly Arizona.
36:46
We fell in love with Arizona, too.
36:48
Where at?
36:49
At the right time of year.
36:50
Oh, yeah.
36:51
Uh—Patsy Junction.
36:54
You know where that’s at.
36:55
Yeah, I lived in Phoenix for 25 years.
36:58
I lived in Scottsdale and Temple most of the time, and in Mesa, too.
37:03
I know where it is.
37:05
I know what you mean by right time of the year, because about
37:07
4 months of the year it’s just—
37:09
Miserable.
37:10
Yeah.
37:11
You get used to it.
37:13
You learn to live with it, but it wears on you.
37:19
Yeah.
37:19
Then most of our time in Arizona, though, we spent up at Prescott.
37:25
We fell in love with Prescott area.
37:27
Whiskey Row.
37:28
Remember Whiskey Row?
37:28
Oh yeah.
37:32
That was a cool area.
37:35
I did a lot of construction, picked up a lot of experience doing block work,
37:41
mortaring block, brick, stuff like that.
37:45
It sounds to me like is your whole thing is you’re just picking up one more area of
37:50
expertise, one more craft, one more trade, one more thing to put in your passel.
37:57
Those early years I was very fortunate to work for contractor bosses that
38:04
when they took on a house, customer or whatever, they took on all of it.
38:09
Back then that was allowed.
38:11
It wasn’t like you had these big tracks where one trade would come in a go
38:16
[swoosh sound] like you have the paint crew and the electrical crew and they’d
38:19
all be separate, and they’d overlap.
38:21
Yep, yep.
38:21
But then everybody’d do their work in a certain sequence, right?
38:23
Yeah.
38:24
Right.
38:26
I gained a wide range of experience in a short period of time and by the ‘80s I was
38:35
already a full-blown carpenter as well as well-experienced in all the other trades.
38:41
Were you a journeyman officially?
38:43
Mm-hmm.
38:44
So, you were in the union?
38:45
No.
38:46
I never joined a union.
38:49
I had hang-ups about the union.
38:53
Anyway, yeah, I never went with them.
38:55
But, I mean, you were a journeyman carpenter, but you could also qualify as
38:59
a journeyman so to speak in some of these other areas in terms of if you had to take
39:03
attest you could test out in electrical and plumbing and what have you, right?
39:08
Exactly, yep.
39:11
That introduced
39:14
me to my early era, early seasons with Andrews.
39:19
In ’81 I was hired on for seasonal help.
39:25
How did that come to be where you went from construction work to being
39:29
hired by the Forest Service, or did you do both still, for a while?
39:32
I was a contractor on the river.
39:35
I was living down in Vida, Oregon.
39:38
That was in ’81.
39:40
I was a contractor.
39:41
I was getting tired of it.
39:42
I didn’t like the rip-off game, so I let my license go and just went
39:48
to work for people because I found out from a friend of mine that
39:51
Oregon has a right to work law.
39:54
They still do.
39:54
You do not have to be a license contractor to earn wages.
40:00
In
40:02
other words, I could not bid, what’s the other—I could estimate a job and
40:07
take the job without any consequences.
40:12
That’s what I did.
40:13
I gave up my license and just started—because it lowered my rates
40:17
that I would have to charge people and everybody on the river just loved it.
40:20
I didn’t have a problem.
40:22
So, you lived in Vida then for a while.
40:23
Yep, I lived in Vida.
40:26
How did you hear about this job.
40:28
What led to this 35-year thing here at the Andrews?
40:32
Their first real site manager was a man named Don Kniley.
40:39
I met him at a home Bible study and he found out my expertise and asked
40:47
me if I’d be willing to help out on my spare time, help him up here at the
40:53
Andrews because he was just swamped up with these ugly house trailers.
40:59
They were dilapidated, falling apart.
41:03
They were 20 years old when the Forest Service gave them to the Andrews.
41:07
They were old fire crew trailers, is what they were.
41:12
I said, sure.
41:13
I’ll give you some time.
41:16
That’s where it started.
41:18
Now, in 1981, if I recall my chronology right of the records I’ve been reviewing,
41:27
basically you had the gray barn, which actually was gray back then, right?
41:31
Yep.
41:32
Okay.
41:33
Then you had a collection of a few trailers, correct?
41:38
No.
41:38
In ’81 the shelters were in and ready for the trailers.
41:44
So, you still didn’t have the trailers up here.
41:46
Gotcha.
41:47
You’re talking about the covers right, the covers?
41:50
Yep.
41:50
Okay, right.
41:51
Who came up with that idea for the covers?
41:53
Well, I’m sure it was the Forest Service engineers.
41:58
Our people said hey these trailers, they need some kind of protection.
42:03
The Forest Service said, well, here’s what we think you should do.
42:08
Build these post structures with roofs over the tops of the trailers.
42:14
Some of them were double-wides but they were actually single
42:18
trailers, just jammed together.
42:22
You have two curved roofs with a water trap right down the middle.
42:27
In other words, if you did it in snow country you’re going
42:31
to have all kinds of problems.
42:32
You’re in big trouble, yeah.
42:34
That’s how that came about.
42:37
At that time all the trailers that were going to be used up here were
42:40
down at Blue River Ranger Station for the fire crews and what have you.
42:49
I was helping with that in ’82 when they got put up here.
42:53
I got hired on to start refurbishing and putting skirts around them, doing
42:59
more trim or trying to make the ceilings look a little better, cleaning up
43:09
all the water stains and just general messes: repairing rot in the floor,
43:18
changing out plumbing.
43:19
A lot of that kind of stuff.
43:21
Ground work.
43:22
We did a lot of ground—this place was naked.
43:26
I planted all these trees.
43:28
Me and Don Kniley, the Site Manager.
43:31
The boss used to laugh at us.
43:32
Art McKee would laugh and say you guys are crazy.
43:37
You’re not even going to get 50% and me and Don looked at him
43:44
and says we’re going to pray and anoint these trees and we’re going
43:45
to guarantee you 80%, and we did.
43:48
We got 80% survival rate in all those trees we planted.
43:52
So, you won your bet with the forest expert, Art, right?
43:56
Right.
43:58
Of course, Art McKee, we’ll talk about later became the Site Manager after Don.
44:03
No, he was the Site Director.
44:04
Site Director, right.
44:05
Okay.
44:07
The Site Manager was always a different category than the Site Director.
44:13
They felt the need to have both.
44:15
The Site Director had too much to do to manage also, so they wanted a
44:21
Site Manager as well as a Director.
44:24
Was one of those trailers, the early ones, was the office, right?
44:28
Yep.
44:29
There was residential and office.
44:31
Was one of them a lab facility, too?
44:33
Yep, lab facility.
44:34
Okay, so they did have crude, but they still had those bases covered?
44:39
In terms of the structures somewhere to work.
44:39
Oh yeah.
44:42
When they first developed the site they planned for that, you know.
44:47
They had lab, office, residential, and maintenance.
44:55
Before that I believe the lab and the office was down actually at
45:00
the Blue River Ranger Station.
45:01
Yep.
45:02
Am I right on that?
45:03
Oh yeah.
45:04
Even though there was the gray—because the gray barn
45:08
was the first structure, right?
45:09
Yeah, it was the first structure.
45:10
It’d been here since ’48.
45:12
’48, really?
45:13
At that time, it was just a pole barn.
45:15
A pole barn, right.
45:18
And an office, shop, was the pole barn.
45:24
The field office.
45:24
It was a field station.
45:26
That’s all it was.
45:27
Was that your initial place of work?
45:29
Was the gray barn?
45:29
Yep, I worked out of the gray barn.
45:32
I’ll never forget a table saw sitting on a dirt floor.
45:37
That was hilarious.
45:39
Good grief.
45:41
But we got by.
45:42
We punched out a lot of stuff right out of that dirt floor.
45:48
Like you said, you make due, though, right?
45:49
Oh yeah.
45:50
That’s part of that midnight budget.
45:52
The table saw was a gift from
45:59
McKenzie High School shop.
46:00
After they retired it, right?
46:01
Yep, they retired it and we got it for free.
46:06
That’s all part of what I call a midnight budget.
46:09
It’s either free or you go sneak it for free.
46:13
I call it a shoestring budget.
46:16
There’s a bunch of metaphors.
46:17
Right.
46:22
That was how our early years started.
46:26
Then in it was
46:31
our first funding was for the new shop facility, because in ’89, ’88
46:39
when the boss approached me about taking on a permanent position.
46:43
So, ’88-’89 is when you transferred from the seasonal,
46:46
combination with your contractor—
46:48
To a permanent position.
46:49
To this.
46:49
Okay, gotcha.
46:51
Tell me about that process.
46:52
He walked me through the whole compound describing what he envisioned
46:59
for a full-blown upgraded facility.
47:03
Was this Don or Art?
47:05
That was Art McKee.
47:07
At that time Don had retired and was turning it all over to me.
47:14
He points all this out and I’m saying Art McKee you are creating a Frankenstein.
47:20
He said, I know it, but we need it.
47:23
We got to have it.
47:25
Because I was in envisioning all the mechanics that would have
47:29
to take place for a full-blown—
47:32
Facility.
47:32
Upgraded facility, yeah.
47:34
And he
47:36
understood what I was saying when I said Frankenstein.
47:39
Frankenstein laboratory you got bells and whistles all over the place.
47:44
But he was walking around, and he said here’s where he
47:47
wanted the shop to go, right?
47:48
Yep, shop’s going to go here.
47:50
We want three residential buildings here, here, and here.
47:53
Future cafeteria will go here.
47:56
Office, lab complex, conference hall, classroom facilities, blah, blah, blah.
48:07
What were your biggest concerns looking at it from the pragmatic,
48:11
mechanical/maintenance side?
48:13
You know, that’s part of the reason why I said Frankenstein.
48:19
From the very beginning I saw maintenance coming up.
48:25
This place was going to demand a lot of tender loving care.
48:31
You’re going to be—
48:32
Even with new buildings, correct?
48:34
Oh yeah.
48:35
Because you’re in the middle of a wilderness.
48:38
Everything’s gravel.
48:39
At that time there was no thought at all about going with paved parking lots or
48:48
blacktop driveways or anything like that.
48:52
Boy, I tell you dust is a killer up here in the summertime.
48:57
Back then, huh?
48:58
Oh man, it was a killer.
49:01
Anyway,
49:04
I knew from the get-go that maintenance was going to get hammered no matter
49:10
how high-quality you go you’re still going to have to maintain that quality.
49:16
Your first full-time hire was as what?
49:18
What was your title?
49:21
It was maintenance and you know my duties, well, one of my first jobs in
49:27
a permanent position was Site Manager.
49:29
That’s Forest Service, you were a Forest Service person?
49:31
Oh no.
49:32
I was Oregon State.
49:33
Oh, you were Oregon State?
49:34
I was a state employee.
49:35
Okay, I’m sorry.
49:36
I wasn’t sure.
49:38
This place a split—there’s been a split historically and that’s why I
49:41
wasn’t sure where the overlaps where.
49:44
So, you were always an OSU person?
49:46
Yep, always were.
49:47
Well, Art was too, I believe.
49:48
Yeah, he was
49:54
OSU side.
49:55
Let’s see, yeah in ’89 one of my first positions to fulfill was a Site
50:03
Manager, but I don’t do paperwork.
50:06
It didn’t last long.
50:08
I really flunked on paperwork.
50:10
I had everybody in trouble after 8 months.
50:13
Uh-oh.
50:15
Oh yeah, and Art McKee was getting all kinds of phone calls.
50:18
You got to get this guy to get this stuff up to date.
50:24
There was a stack of papers on the desk that I hadn’t touched.
50:29
Because I had too much else to do.
50:30
Because not only was I Site Manager at that time, the field crew they
50:37
didn’t have time to take care of facilities, so I was the janitor
50:41
and the maintenance, the garbage—
50:45
And the night watch.
50:46
We called it the honey wagon.
50:47
Night watchman.
50:48
Yep, night watchman because I lived on the facility.
50:51
Yeah, I was covering a lot of bases.
50:56
There was way too much fun stuff to do than to be sitting at a desk.
51:04
They relieved me of my Site Manager duties and pretty much plugged me
51:08
into maintenance and construction.
51:11
Which was a much better fit.
51:14
Yeah, Art said look if I plug you into a permanent position will you stay?
51:20
Because we were not only seasonal workers, we were notorious gypsies.
51:28
You were with your wife still, right?
51:30
Oh yeah.
51:31
We were well-known by everybody to leave the state and there’s no telling
51:37
where we were until they heard from us.
51:42
It might be Texas.
51:44
It might be Arizona.
51:45
It might be New Mexico.
51:48
No telling where we might be.
51:50
But anyway, he made the offer and I said yeah, Art.
51:54
I’ll stay.
51:57
That’s where it began.
51:59
So, the Allman Brothers, “Rambling Man,” song is your song, right?
52:04
[Laughs]
52:04
Yep [laughs]
52:06
. Go on, sorry.
52:07
Yeah, and of course they already knew I was a carpenter, so his idea,
52:15
he thought the best investment he could give to Andrews was to tackle
52:21
as much in-house construction as we would be allowed to get away with.
52:27
In other words, do everything you could without having to hire outside contractors
52:32
and go to bid and all that, right?
52:34
Yep.
52:36
That’s what we did.
52:37
The shop was built on National Science Foundation funds.
52:41
The first building was built with a grant in National Science Foundation.
52:48
Are you talking about the office?
52:51
No, not the office complex.
52:52
This shop right here.
52:53
Oh, you’re talking about the first building of the shop?
52:58
No.
52:59
The whole building.
53:02
That’s what I’m saying.
53:02
There were two phases, right?
53:03
They added onto it?
53:05
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you.
53:07
That’s one of the first things I told Art, you want me to build all
53:12
this stuff the first thing you’re going to have to do is get me a shop.
53:15
I’m not working out of the gray barn no more.
53:18
You cannot build what you want to build out of that dirt
53:22
floor and I’m not doing it.
53:24
He said, no problem.
53:25
That’ll be the first thing we do.
53:27
We’ll build a good shop.
53:30
Go ahead and do it.
53:30
That was finished in what year—’89 or ’90, something like
53:35
that?
53:36
Mm-hmm.
53:36
That’s where we started.
53:38
And in ’90 we started the Quartz building residence.
53:42
Okay.
53:43
They felt like the first thing, well, they didn’t have a whole lot of choice
53:49
because the trailers were at the point where you’re pumping more money into
53:54
them than, anyway, they were just dying.
54:00
They were just dying.
54:01
You can’t keep resurrecting something that’s already in the graveyard.
54:07
Right.
54:07
Right.
54:07
So, Quartz was the first residence building that was built?
54:10
Mm-hmm.
54:10
Quartz was the first residence building.
54:12
And then it was Roswell.
54:15
Quartz was in ’90, ’91 for Roswell, and ‘92/’93 for Rainbow.
54:22
Speaking of the old trailers, do you remember who coined the
54:26
term “ghetto in the meadow?”
54:28
I don’t know where that came from.
54:30
I mean I’ve heard it from everybody, but nobody knows where it comes from.
54:33
Nobody wants to claim it.
54:35
I know it came out of Corvallis researchers, because they were
54:38
the ones that had to live on this facility and do their research.
54:42
So, they could refer to it kind of like, oh yeah, we have to go to
54:46
the ghetto of the meadow from our city slicker, nice environment.
54:51
Right, gotcha.
54:53
What were some of the funny stories that happened in those trailers?
54:58
I’ve heard different ones about the floors falling through.
55:02
The classic one was, oh man, who was it?
55:06
Stan?
55:06
Gregory?
55:08
Taking a shower one night in the tub and the tub fell through the floor, literally.
55:13
It just went, it dropped about 6” with him taking a shower.
55:19
Was he okay?
55:22
Yeah.
55:22
Fortunately, he didn’t hurt nothing.
55:24
Didn’t even get a scratch, but yeah, they were turning
55:29
into a safety issue, for sure.
55:31
All the trailers were resembling that kind of trouble.
55:34
You had a lot of rats, too, didn’t you?
55:36
No.
55:36
We had some of the single-wides didn’t have roof protection.
55:41
They were out in the open.
55:43
Well, when they got snow, the windows wouldn’t open,
55:47
and the doors wouldn’t open.
55:49
We had to shovel snow off of the roof before we could
55:53
even get inside the trailer.
55:55
But this was before the shelters were over top, right?
55:58
Well, no, what I’m saying is the single-wide residences
56:02
they didn’t have the shelters.
56:04
Just the double-wide because you were worried about the square footage of
56:08
the roofs would build up the weight.
56:09
That’s right.
56:09
Gotcha.
56:13
The single wide we just figured we could get by with keeping
56:16
the roof patched, you know.
56:18
That old trick, which never worked for very long.
56:20
I bet you had a lot of leaks in those things.
56:23
Oh yeah.
56:24
They were everywhere.
56:25
Constant battle.
56:25
Did people ever lose their research or books, or anything get ruined?
56:29
I mean, I was—
56:31
No, nothing got ruined.
56:32
But
56:35
there were steady concerns for—because most of the leaks would run down
56:41
on the inside of the exterior wall.
56:44
That’s where all the leaks would develop.
56:46
So, naturally your concern is the framing is rotting out.
56:53
It’s falling apart.
56:54
You also got to worry about mold and health issue with people living
56:58
in it because of the spores that come out of the mold and you can
57:01
get some respiratory problems.
57:03
Remember Valley Fever down in Arizona, that kind of thing?
57:06
A little different, but a take on that kind of pathogens, yeah.
57:11
Those kinds of issues.
57:13
And photos.
57:14
We took a real good
57:18
set of photos of all the damage that we were battling.
57:22
We weren’t neglecting, but we were in a constant battle to fix all these
57:27
issues and that went to Washington and that’s what convinced the senate,
57:34
in fact from what I heard, the one senator said, you guys need help.
57:40
Big time.
57:42
They just came right out and said, you need help.
57:45
They got their first funding for Roswell from Congress to start
57:51
eliminating more of these old trailers that we were working out of.
57:57
The Roswell and Rainbow were Forest Service dollars and office building,
58:04
cafeteria was Forest Service dollars.
58:08
The conference hall was in-house construction.
58:14
We wanted to preserve the old structure of the trailer roof structure.
58:20
We wanted to preserve that.
58:22
The height was there.
58:25
They were wanting the extra height.
58:27
Our
58:30
thinking was to frame in between all the post-and-beam areas put in
58:36
a wood floor, that kind of thing.
58:40
The Forest Service said yeah that would be a good in-house construction project
58:44
because it wouldn’t be cost efficient for us to contract that kind of work
58:51
because it would be too much labor involved, too much labor cost involved.
58:59
We got to build that one in-house.
59:08
You’re talking about Salt Salmon, right?
59:12
What’s now the cover.
59:13
Yeah, that’s what those structures looked like.
59:16
Post and beam and a roof.
59:17
That’s the one that you kept, because wasn’t there 3 or 4 of them?
59:19
That’s the only one we kept.
59:22
There was 3 or 4 of them, right?
59:22
The office, I mean, the conference hall is the one we kept and it’s all enclosed.
59:31
Gotcha.
59:31
Okay.
59:32
Salt Salmon we kept just because I talked them into keeping
59:35
it for an open-air pavilion.
59:38
It’s become the center piece of everything.
59:39
Yeah.
59:41
To me it was a perfect choice.
59:42
He said, well, yeah that would work [chuckles]
59:47
. Now, you’re in the planning of this, you were definitely involved because you had
59:52
Art’s ear and you had other people’s ear.
59:54
You were part of giving ideas for this whole process, then, as it unfolded?
59:59
Yeah.
1:00:01
Art would say, here’s what we want over here.
1:00:03
Here’s what I want.
1:00:05
I want a two-story unit, a—I can’t remember how many people—anyway,
1:00:15
I want it to face this direction.
1:00:18
He would give me some general ideas of what he wanted, then I’d go to the
1:00:22
drafting table and start drafting.
1:00:24
So, you had a big part of the planning?
1:00:26
Yeah, yeah.
1:00:27
Then I would draw up what I thought he was picturing in his mind and show it to him.
1:00:33
He’d say, yeah, like that but nah, let’s not do it that way.
1:00:37
Let’s do it like this.
1:00:40
It was a team effort.
1:00:42
Then I would finalize the complete set of drawings.
1:00:46
Get them approved by the Forest Service and then start construction.
1:00:50
That’s how that went for every building that we did in-house; we got the Forest
1:00:55
Service to override the engineering.
1:00:59
They would sign off on my plans and then we’d break ground.
1:01:05
It was a good arrangement.
1:01:06
What were the biggest concerns out here in terms of structural
1:01:11
integrity, but also foundations.
1:01:13
How solid is this area?
1:01:15
I mean, it was cleared, but what’s the strength of the bedrock and the soil?
1:01:25
It’s kind of like pockets.
1:01:27
There are some places that are really, really stable and some
1:01:32
places that are a little loose.
1:01:34
But it’s a fairly flat plateau.
1:01:37
It’s
1:01:40
basically a gravel bar, is what it amounts to.
1:01:43
It’s flat through here where we put the site.
1:01:46
It’s an old gravel bar.
1:01:48
There’s some clay, but it’s a sandy, rocky clay and it’s full of rock.
1:01:55
Good drainage.
1:01:56
But it drains well, is what I was going to say.
1:01:57
Yeah, it drains really well.
1:01:59
So, your septic situation was never that big of a problem, right?
1:02:02
No, that didn’t come until much, much later in the building program.
1:02:08
They started to become more and more rigid.
1:02:10
The
1:02:12
Environmental Protection Agency was created, and they had
1:02:18
a say in everything we did.
1:02:22
We ended up with pressurized drain fill systems.
1:02:27
We had the big filters system that was put in to make them
1:02:31
happy for the cafeteria building.
1:02:33
Right.
1:02:36
That’s about it.
1:02:37
Everything else was gravity.
1:02:40
This newest building, that one, is gravity drain fill but the septic it has a pump
1:02:48
that pushes it up the hill to the drain field area and then it disperses from
1:02:52
there as gravity from there, drain fill.
1:02:58
The footprint’s pretty well-done.
1:03:01
It’s going to be 99% maintenance now, just take care of what you got.
1:03:09
You’re pretty much full to what you could do big-structure wise
1:03:13
in this flat area, correct?
1:03:14
Mm-hmm, yeah.
1:03:15
You don’t have a lot of extra space without clearing more forest, right?
1:03:19
Right, and they’re not going to go there.
1:03:21
No, I wouldn’t think so.
1:03:24
We were awarded in the very beginning the site development plan was
1:03:31
awarded on the, what would you say, contingent of 125 people, anyway.
1:03:38
That’s your limit.
1:03:40
125 overnight people.
1:03:43
You can have more during the day, but, as far as people
1:03:46
living on site, that’s our limit.
1:03:49
So, if you did a census, if you will, of all the potential domiciles
1:03:54
here, including your place, that place, the different places, the
1:03:58
max would be more or less 125.
1:04:00
Yeah.
1:04:00
Okay, gotcha.
1:04:05
So, when you got here, what kind of parallel job—I know that John
1:04:12
Moreau, for instance, was the guy who did all the technician stuff and
1:04:17
monitoring all the climate stations and all the flumes and all that stuff.
1:04:22
But you also took part in constructing and maintaining the field equipment, too.
1:04:28
Oh, yeah.
1:04:29
Tell me a little bit about what it was like in the very beginning
1:04:33
when you got here in terms of the infrastructure in the field.
1:04:37
You’re talking about the first years of the LTER status, 1 and then 2,
1:04:42
more money and more scientists.
1:04:45
It was building critical mass, if you will, for a lot of different things.
1:04:50
But what was it like when you got there in the field, out there, in
1:04:54
terms of the structure and did you—?
1:04:56
It was real primitive.
1:04:58
In the early days, I mean we’re talking instruments were nailed
1:05:03
to the trees back in those days.
1:05:08
Data collecting instruments were basically hung on the trees.
1:05:11
Right.
1:05:12
There weren’t many, especially the
1:05:18
meteorological equipment, there just weren’t any real structures for them.
1:05:23
We had a few primitive structures for the watershed program.
1:05:30
You’re talking about the little gauge houses?
1:05:30
Mm-hmm, the little gauge houses with the water gauges and stuff.
1:05:36
But met stations were basically non-existent.
1:05:40
They were just, like you said, nailed to a tree.
1:05:42
Yeah.
1:05:43
Whatever the piece of equipment was.
1:05:46
You look at the early pictures of Andrews you go, “That’s what they had,” right?
1:05:49
Yep, that’s what they had.
1:05:52
It started pretty primitive and then gradually you get enough funding to
1:05:56
go build a more permanent met station.
1:06:01
We started off at the lower elevations and kind of moved our way, year by
1:06:07
year, up the mountain until we finally ended up with the last one, which
1:06:12
was at least for meteorologic, well, meteorological [observations] , too,
1:06:19
Roswell Ridge was the last one we did.
1:06:22
That’s the one we had to take in everything by helicopter
1:06:26
up on Roswell Ridge.
1:06:28
The first one was the little met station down here, right?
1:06:32
Right here in the yard.
1:06:33
When did Central Met get built?
1:06:36
There’s the house and all that stuff.
1:06:38
Actually, UPLO [Upper Lookout] came first.
1:06:39
UPLO came first?
1:06:39
On the lookout.
1:06:41
UPLO came first.
1:06:46
Then we went to Central and then we went to Vanilla Leaf, and then
1:06:50
we went to Vanilla Leaf Meadow.
1:06:52
That was the last for the full-blown meteorological, and then Roswell Ridge
1:06:57
was more recent and that was not just meteorological, but mostly that was put in
1:07:04
for the antennas to pick up Wi-Fi signal, computer signal from Corvallis, which
1:07:13
Mark [Schulze], Forest Director] says they might get funding to finalize this year.
1:07:18
They’ll make the valley connection.
1:07:20
It seems to me, and Mark and I talked about this, and John [Moreau] and I,
1:07:26
we did an interview, we traveled, we went over there in the shop area and we
1:07:31
talked about equipment and stuff and then we spent the whole day going up around
1:07:34
and he told me about the problems of basically making this place connected.
1:07:40
Yeah.
1:07:41
I go, well, why don’t you just put a hardline.
1:07:44
Then he told me about all the rules about having to run a line from
1:07:46
[Highway] 126, and all the right-of-ways and the problems you’d have,
1:07:50
and you’d
1:07:54
have to like offer it to everybody that potentially could be in
1:07:57
that area and it’s so expensive.
1:08:00
And the Forest Service is concerned on the security side of it.
1:08:07
So, tapping into the lines, right?
1:08:09
Yeah.
1:08:10
There’s that issue, too.
1:08:13
It’s a multi-million-dollar problem to resolve, and so they’re choosing to
1:08:19
go Wi-Fi aerial signal to Corvallis.
1:08:22
I think that makes sense.
1:08:24
I think Mark, but also John, told me the concerns where that in the winter-time; if
1:08:30
you had technical issue and there’s tons of snow, fixing it could be intense or
1:08:37
very difficult, especially because you’re going to be up on top of some ridge, not
1:08:43
on the road, you have to climb up to it.
1:08:45
It can be real difficult.
1:08:47
Yeah,
1:08:52
it’s a challenge.
1:08:54
Everything that gets done up here is a challenge
1:09:03
[laughs]
1:09:03
. Now, I’ll segue out of the early phase we’re talking about.
1:09:07
You talked about Stan [Gregory] and the thing falling through the floor.
1:09:10
Are there any other anecdotes or interesting stories, whether it’s
1:09:15
funny or even serious that you remember from those early days that
1:09:19
will capture something, the essence of the place or a particular incident?
1:09:24
Yeah,
1:09:27
well, there’s a lot of stuff like that was happening in “ghetto in
1:09:32
the meadow.” Like our honey wagon, that was a whole trip in itself.
1:09:38
Back in those days at least for us there was no such thing as garbage liners.
1:09:44
Everything went in the garbage can, and then it went to the honey wagon and we
1:09:49
would take it to the dump once a week.
1:09:51
It would be seriously biological by the time it’d been there a week, right?
1:09:57
We’re talking maggot-level.
1:10:07
That’s what I mean [laughs] . Poltergeist level, right [laughs]
1:10:07
. [Laughs] When you took the lid off the garbage can you had a bat in
1:10:10
the other hand, because there’s no telling what was going to be in there.
1:10:16
That was a nasty era.
1:10:18
That was our job, that was my job.
1:10:20
You had to haul all that way where to, like Vida or Blue River.
1:10:22
Yeah, McKenzie Dump transfer site.
1:10:28
Then of course we had to pull it all out of the honey wagon into the
1:10:33
dumpster, bring it back to Andrews and get it set up for the next load.
1:10:41
Then one era when we did go to
1:10:46
the can-liners, the system worked good as long as people remembered to do that.
1:10:55
The straw that broke the camel’s back on that setup [laughs] was one
1:11:04
week we were going through, me and a couple other helpers, were going
1:11:09
through picking up all the cans.
1:11:12
One had gotten filled with no liner, so I said, no we’re
1:11:17
not going to deal with this.
1:11:18
We’re not going to empty the can, we’re just going to throw
1:11:20
the can and everything away.
1:11:24
It’s just too nasty.
1:11:25
This thing was really gross.
1:11:27
I went to the boss and said we’re done.
1:11:32
I’m not doing this no more.
1:11:34
I don’t have time to deal with other people’s criminal negligence.
1:11:42
He said, “I agree Terry.
1:11:44
I believe you.
1:11:46
Okay what are we going to do?” [So, I said,} “Let’s get, they have these
1:11:52
green cans, I don’t know if you ever saw them or not, Art, but they have these
1:11:56
green cans, they call them dumpsters and they’re not very expensive and we can
1:12:01
buy into that program for $40 a month.”
1:12:06
You’re talking about plastic or composition made, right?
1:12:09
Not metal ones?
1:12:10
Well, the garbage truck comes up and empties the can.
1:12:13
You don’t have to go to the dump no more.
1:12:15
All you have to do is put your garbage in that big can.
1:12:19
Now, that’s simple.
1:12:22
Then of course it was right out front by basically where it’s at right
1:12:26
now without a garbage enclosure.
1:12:30
That was one of the—anyway, “Terry, we got to hide this.” That was Fred
1:12:36
Swanson. I hate to mention any names, but
1:12:42
just some way to make that a little more attractive. Well, yeah, we can
1:12:46
put a privacy fence around it, dress it up, so it won’t look so terrible.
1:12:53
We did that.
1:12:58
It had its moments of hilarity, but mostly it was just a nightmare.
1:13:04
I was glad to see them at least consent to the expense of making a better refuse.
1:13:14
So, in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s was when really over a period of 4
1:13:20
to 5 years was when this place went from the ghetto in the meadow to most
1:13:25
of what you see here today, correct?
1:13:27
That was the problem on my side.
1:13:29
I just did not have the time to deal with all these side issues,
1:13:36
like the honey wagon, because of the construction taking place at the
1:13:40
same time, in-house construction.
1:13:43
There was a lot of it going on.
1:13:45
It was not just the facility itself being built.
1:13:49
We built all the cabins at gypsy camp at the same time right in the
1:13:55
parking lot in front of Roswell while we were building Roswell building.
1:13:59
Wasn’t there also a cabin up in Mack Creek?
1:14:02
Yeah.
1:14:03
And emergency cabins.
1:14:05
Like shelters and stuff.
1:14:07
Wasn’t there a snow site, too, way up high?
1:14:11
Yep, snow site and WIldcat.
1:14:16
We had a site up at Wildcat Mountain [and Research Natural Area] . I’m
1:14:21
trying to think of some of the other.
1:14:23
Anyway, all the fill stations were being built too, while—
1:14:27
Was there also a site at Hagan Block?
1:14:29
Yeah, but it never—Hagan Block never had a full-blown construction kind of set up.
1:14:38
Okay.
1:14:38
It was mostly just, in fact, it still is—it’s just
1:14:44
primitive shelters with data collectors.
1:14:47
Real basic.
1:14:48
Anyway, you were about ready to tell me something and I kind
1:14:51
of segued into Hagan Block.
1:14:52
Right,
1:14:56
I was just going to make the comment that a lot of construction all over
1:15:01
the Andrews Forest was taking place by me and my crew while were building
1:15:08
the buildings, the residences.
1:15:11
Did you, well, I know you didn’t always, but did you at times have enough help and
1:15:17
assistance to be able to do this work?
1:15:19
Oh yeah, during that work program we were allowed to hire,
1:15:26
anyway, we hired local people.
1:15:29
The largest crew I ever ran was 6 besides me, so there was 7 of us on the job.
1:15:35
So, these were people from McKenzie, Blue River area?
1:15:37
Yep.
1:15:37
And this was of course when the beginning of the logging boom collapsed.
1:15:43
Yep.
1:15:43
There were a lot of people looking for work, yeah?
1:15:46
Yeah, they came crawling out of the woodwork.
1:15:50
Were you able to find qualified people easily?
1:15:53
No.
1:15:53
Was that hard?
1:15:56
I wasn’t scared of hiring greenhorns.
1:16:00
I could teach, and they could pick up things pretty quickly.
1:16:03
As long as they were reliable and honest about whatever, right?
1:16:06
Yeah, that was the key factor.
1:16:08
Get here on time.
1:16:10
Keep yourself sober.
1:16:11
You can smoke all you want to after work.
1:16:17
That wasn’t easy, but we got by.
1:16:21
They were good men.
1:16:23
They were all local, actually kids most of the time.
1:16:29
They were good kids.
1:16:30
They all had their problems, but they were good on the job for the most part.
1:16:38
I got wind of them.
1:16:41
I should’ve been suspicious, but I wasn’t.
1:16:44
They were taking their lunch breaks down at the creek and then I found
1:16:47
out through the grapevine a little later that their lunchbreaks
1:16:51
consisted of whiskey and marijuana.
1:16:55
[Laughs]
1:16:56
. I’m shocked [laughs]
1:16:59
. I didn’t have a clue.
1:17:01
When I heard about that I just had a little chat with them.
1:17:07
I said I’m not going to fuss at you guys.
1:17:09
You’re doing good work, you know.
1:17:11
You’re not messing nothing up and you’re not messing yourself up on the job, so
1:17:17
as long as it’s not interfering with your work I’m not going to clip you.
1:17:24
But just be warned if the bosses catch you.
1:17:28
They will clip you.
1:17:28
You’ll be gone.
1:17:29
Yeah, you’ll be gone.
1:17:31
Art had no toleration for
1:17:37
any of that kind of activity on the job.
1:17:40
I mean, he’s never been opposed to any of that stuff just not on the job.
1:17:46
Realistically for insurance reasons alone and liability you can’t
1:17:50
have people high and drinking especially around power tools and
1:17:56
stuff [laughs]
1:17:56
. Exactly.
1:17:57
I had my crazy days, but I even knew better than
1:18:02
that.
1:18:03
They curtailed it.
1:18:04
It seemed like their work effort improved a little after that.
1:18:11
Yeah, we went through lots of different people working up here for us.
1:18:18
Did part of the connections you had stem from when you
1:18:21
were a contractor down in Vida?
1:18:23
Did you know enough people where you knew how to ask around
1:18:26
and find or just advertise?
1:18:27
No, we just advertised, word of mouth mostly.
1:18:31
We’re looking for people that’s wanting to work.
1:18:35
Who’s the best assistant you ever had?
1:18:37
If you want to even mention anybody?
1:18:43
Somebody who was here for a long—?
1:18:44
I would say the one I got right now,
1:18:48
the one that’s here now, but he’s only been here for a year.
1:18:52
Are you talking about Doug?
1:18:53
Yeah, besides Doug who’s only been here a year, the best one I had was
1:18:58
the previous one, Tom [another helper in the maintenance/construction
1:18:59
crew] . He was just an amazing man.
1:19:02
He was a professional, certified fabricator for most of the years
1:19:08
of his life, but he was also a sales rep also for a big outfit in
1:19:15
Junction City for steel fabrication.
1:19:22
He worked for an outfit that manufactured metal components for all
1:19:31
kinds of warehouses, mills, you know they had milling machines and
1:19:40
they were into that kind of thing.
1:19:41
He was one of their sales rep for a long time, too.
1:19:45
But the guy, he’s just an excellent mechanic.
1:19:51
You could tell him
1:19:54
half a sentence and he knew where to take it from there.
1:19:57
That’s the way he was.
1:19:59
A hard worker.
1:20:01
He wasn’t a high-energy level.
1:20:04
Those kinds of people make me nervous anyway, because
1:20:07
that’s the way I used to be.
1:20:09
I don’t need no more high energy levels than what I got.
1:20:14
He was just a good, strong, steady—in fact, he was good at
1:20:19
pacing me, slow yourself down a little bit so we can finish the day.
1:20:27
He was a really good hand.
1:20:30
Good sense of humor.
1:20:32
Was a little rough around the edges when it came to picking on people
1:20:39
[laughs] . He liked to needle people,
1:20:44
get ‘em fired up and then walk away [laughs]
1:20:49
. He would throw a grenade out there and then leave.
1:20:50
Exactly [laughs]
1:20:56
. So, when the whole big construction thing was going on over that few-year period
1:21:02
of time and congress got involved, I think Mark Hatfield and congressman,
1:21:07
Les AuCoin, some of the big names that had a lot to do with the appropriations
1:21:11
that made the big construction possible.
1:21:13
That was happening, and you guys also had your other funds to do other things.
1:21:18
But what was that period like, the five years where it was really going on where
1:21:23
this campus was being built, essentially?
1:21:26
You want to describe a little bit about that?
1:21:28
Draw a thumbnail sketch of that?
1:21:30
Boy it was a heyday, that’s for sure.
1:21:33
Like I said before there was a lot going on at one time.
1:21:37
I wasn’t just the facility it was everything, you know?
1:21:41
The research as well as—
1:21:43
It was exploding at the same time, right?
1:21:46
In terms of the numbers of people, the funding, the levels
1:21:49
of the science, everything.
1:21:51
The science community was growing.
1:21:54
The interest, the study interest was growing and branching out more and more.
1:22:03
It was just a hectic—in fact, the crew used to laugh at me.
1:22:08
It wasn’t unusual, I’d be standing out in the middle of the parking lot in front
1:22:12
of the shop and all of a sudden, you’d just get swamped by about 10 people and
1:22:18
every one of them was having an emergency and needed something done right now.
1:22:24
The crew would just crack up and walk away—alright, Cryer,
1:22:29
we’ll see you after work.
1:22:31
Because they knew you had something—
1:22:32
Yeah,
1:22:35
yeah.
1:22:36
Oh, boy.
1:22:38
Because we were still maintenance while we’re doing all this
1:22:42
construction everywhere.
1:22:44
But you recognized early on, and I’m sure that was made clear when you were hired,
1:22:48
and everything evolved from that point, where ultimately the primary purpose is
1:22:54
to make sure the science can continue?
1:22:57
Oh yeah.
1:22:58
Regardless of residences and all that, ultimately the science had to remain
1:23:03
continuous because the record stream is everything in a long-term research site.
1:23:07
Yep.
1:23:08
That was made clear to me from the very get-go.
1:23:13
In fact, we had to have a name for the shop before we could get it funded
1:23:18
by the National Science Foundation.
1:23:21
We chose RSB: Research Support Building.
1:23:26
That’s the actual, architectural name for the shop and that’s been our motto
1:23:36
from the get-go, is research support.
1:23:38
They come first.
1:23:41
Yeah that’s always been high priority for us.
1:23:45
Because basically everything maintenance does is to support
1:23:49
the research community anyway.
1:23:52
Right.
1:23:53
So, when they come to me needing something for their fieldwork or the
1:24:00
field research, they come to me because they know I have the expertise, I’m
1:24:06
good at designing and building and so they: we’re thinking about this?
1:24:12
Would this work?
1:24:13
Do you have anything in the boneyard [collection of left
1:24:15
over stuff] that we could
1:24:19
make do for this particular project?
1:24:21
Yeah, let’s go take a look, you know?
1:24:23
Yeah, we could do that.
1:24:25
Let’s go draw it out on paper.
1:24:27
I think if we do this and this, this will work better.
1:24:31
That kind of thing for the researchers.
1:24:34
And we still do.
1:24:36
We’re always brainstorming with them for even maintenance
1:24:42
for the research stations.
1:24:44
We help them out as much as they need.
1:24:49
When you got here what was your understanding of science and the earth
1:24:53
sciences and what was your idea about scientists and those intellectuals and
1:24:59
university people and how has that evolved from when you first got here until now?
1:25:05
I’m sure that you’ve learned a lot.
1:25:06
Yeah, I have.
1:25:08
But I think a lot of that I already understood.
1:25:13
The community I grew up in, the church I grew up in, my dad—they were all
1:25:20
conscientious caretakers of what God has given us, and, as soon as I got here, I
1:25:29
admired the efforts that were being made.
1:25:33
You understood the stewardship ethic?
1:25:34
Yeah, the stewardship.
1:25:38
The first thing that hit my mind is God told Adam this is your job to dress
1:25:45
and keep the garden and that’s our job.
1:25:48
Every individual, that’s our basic job is to take care of
1:25:53
what we live in and not abuse it.
1:25:55
Don’t tear it up.
1:25:56
Don’t ruin it for the next people.
1:25:59
We’re supposed to take care of it.
1:26:02
Look for problems before they get big and not—yeah, I admire this community
1:26:08
from the first time I met them.
1:26:11
Because I thought, yes, you guys are on the right track.
1:26:14
They’re trying to do good.
1:26:15
They’re trying to do good, that’s right.
1:26:19
It may not always work, but boy they’re A-effort.
1:26:25
What do you remember about Jerry Franklin?
1:26:27
Oh my God.
1:26:29
What a character
1:26:35
[laughs] . Him and his bonfire side chats.
1:26:40
Here or out in the field?
1:26:41
That was out, it was always called Gypsy Camp.
1:26:45
We’re not supposed to call it that anymore.
1:26:47
Now they say formerly called gypsy.
1:26:48
Yeah, formerly Gypsy Camp.
1:26:50
The political police are everywhere, right?
1:26:52
They had a pit fire there that could handle Jerry Franklin’s bonfires.
1:26:58
When he had a campfire, it was a big one.
1:27:03
That’s the way he used to love to do field teaching is get all the kids around
1:27:08
the fire and start talking and pick their brain and debate and talk it out.
1:27:16
Jerry Franklin, he’s one of those, yeah, and he can really throw it out there, boy.
1:27:26
He’s a brilliant man.
1:27:27
He’s a dynamic personality, yeah.
1:27:29
He just retired at 81 years old from being a professor at University of Washington.
1:27:34
I know.
1:27:35
Yep.
1:27:37
I interviewed him last year, and you could tell he was really going to miss it.
1:27:41
Oh yeah, I know.
1:27:43
He was down here for his last class about 2 months ago.
1:27:51
I got to spend not much time with him but quite a bit of time with his wife.
1:27:55
He had his wife here with him, and that was really enjoyable.
1:27:59
Very rewarding.
1:28:00
Beautiful lady.
1:28:03
I
1:28:06
hate to see old Jerry give it up, but oh well, it’s time to pass the hat.
1:28:13
Because when you first got here he was kind of the big personality and name and
1:28:20
leader of the team both from the Forest Service side but also the Andrews in
1:28:25
general and all of his “new forestry” stuff and all the things he was working
1:28:30
on, which he became even more famous for after he left the Andrews, or right as he
1:28:36
was leaving the Andrews and Oregon State.
1:28:39
He was like the big godfather.
1:28:43
Fred Swanson would be more like the understudy.
1:28:47
The lieutenant.
1:28:48
For Jerry, yeah.
1:28:51
He’s—Fred, I think Fred, because he stayed in Corvallis I think
1:29:00
he saw it as much of his mission to shepherd the legacy, legacies—plural—of
1:29:06
the Andrews in many different areas, which is one reason I got involved
1:29:10
with the history work as well as the archival thing and we’re doing
1:29:13
the oral history thing here today.
1:29:18
What are some of the other people from, maybe even from the early
1:29:22
days that were still there, like Ross Mersereau and any of the—
1:29:27
I barely got to know Ross.
1:29:29
He wasn’t around that much at that time when I started work up here.
1:29:32
Oh really?
1:29:34
Most of the time I was too busy to make contact with him very much.
1:29:39
Okay.
1:29:40
It was fun.
1:29:42
He’s quite a character.
1:29:45
Always made me think of a cowboy, an old cowboy.
1:29:51
You knew his war story, didn’t you?
1:29:53
Yeah.
1:29:53
Did you ever hear about Korea.
1:29:56
Real rugged man.
1:29:58
He got lost alone or something, if I recall right?
1:30:02
Yep.
1:30:05
John knew him really well, John Moreau They were good friends.
1:30:11
I never really got that close to him.
1:30:14
I was too busy, I guess.
1:30:16
That was one.
1:30:18
Most of the ones I connected with were some of
1:30:23
the young professors at that time, like Mark Harmon, Stan Gregory, string team
1:30:30
when they were in their full-blown stream study on Lookout Creek, which had pretty
1:30:38
much closed up now, moved on to other studies, but back then it was Rainbow Left
1:30:48
was their designated unit for many years.
1:30:53
They did their studies out of that.
1:30:56
When Stan comes up here with his wife I think he still stays at Rainbow.
1:30:59
It’s like his place.
1:31:00
Oh yeah.
1:31:02
In fact, before they even moved in after we laid the floor, it was funny, I mean
1:31:10
I wasn’t being a stickler about it, I just told him you know the best way—he
1:31:15
wanted to know—the best way to make this floor last forever is don’t give it one
1:31:22
or two coats of wax, give it 7 because that’s always finisher’s magic number.
1:31:29
7 thin coats is better than 2 heavy coats every time.
1:31:35
He did.
1:31:36
He stayed up all night long and gave it 7 thin coats every hour.
1:31:42
Of what, like urethane?
1:31:44
Just a floor wax, a high-grade commercial wax.
1:31:49
That floor stayed gorgeous for years.
1:31:54
He did a beautiful job, and this is a professor doing this.
1:31:58
I was amazed.
1:32:00
That was Stan Gregory, boy I’ll tell you he’s a very humorous man, too.
1:32:07
I hear he’s one of the best story tellers.
1:32:10
Oh yeah.
1:32:12
It’s always going to have a funny twist to it.
1:32:15
He’s got that sense of humor and the little quip which throws in a little bing.
1:32:20
Yeah.
1:32:24
Now Mark Harmon’s study, I believe he started to conceptualize it in ’83, ’84
1:32:30
[it was] he was this grad student of Jerry Franklin’s and then he hatched
1:32:34
the 200-year log decomposition study [Franklin hatched it, but Harmon added
1:32:37
a great deal in the execution] . Did you have something to do with helping
1:32:40
him construct the infrastructure for that or was that all him?
1:32:44
Yeah, I was involved with him in setting up the table saw, setting
1:32:50
up jigs for cutting all the tinker toys, that’s what we called them.
1:32:55
I spent a lot of the early ‘80s, I spent a lot of time helping him with the calipers
1:33:02
and instruments for measuring and weighing before they went to the drying oven and
1:33:10
after they came out of the drying oven for the archive that was a big process.
1:33:16
We’re talking hundreds and hundreds of little wooden
1:33:21
blocks cut out of tree cookies.
1:33:25
Right, right.
1:33:26
That stuff.
1:33:29
Part of the log decomp [decomposition] program is somebody’s got to do it.
1:33:32
Did you use a lot of the extra stuff from him to start doing artistic thing
1:33:38
or was that completely separate wood?
1:33:41
You’ve built all this furniture here we’re looking at, right?
1:33:45
Yeah.
1:33:47
Did you start getting creative with some of his old cookies
1:33:50
or things he wasn’t using?
1:33:52
I started getting interested in doing artistic levels of cookies
1:33:57
from his program, for sure.
1:33:59
That’s what I’m asking.
1:34:00
I figured you said, well—because you get to look at all the beautiful rings
1:34:05
and the different shapes of wood.
1:34:06
That’s what I’m looking at is he’s cutting them all into these little
1:34:10
bitty blocks and I’m looking at the whole cookie and said, man, these
1:34:15
things are too pretty to be done at, so I started making my own cookies and
1:34:22
making plaques or whatever.
1:34:25
But I’ve always been interested in my artistic side.
1:34:29
My wife and I used to go driftwood hunting and I don’t mean sea shore, I mean hiking
1:34:35
up creeks, hiking up and down creeks.
1:34:38
You find beautiful pieces of driftwood in all sorts of patterns, shapes, sizes.
1:34:46
You’re talking about even up in the mountains here, not on the coast, right?
1:34:52
Yeah.
1:34:52
I mean we just called it driftwood.
1:34:54
It’s a kind of wood that washes down a creek or gets hung up in a log jam and it
1:34:59
gets washed by mother nature for years.
1:35:02
And it gets polished.
1:35:03
Without getting rotten and they just end up being beautiful pieces of artwork.
1:35:15
Like this furniture I built, that’s what I look for.
1:35:18
I look for natural things that has character and then take it from there
1:35:24
and try to leave it as natural as I can.
1:35:28
Old hippie.
1:35:28
Hippies love that kind of thing.
1:35:31
Oh, I know, but it’s a good thing.
1:35:35
Yeah, it is.
1:35:38
Leave it as natural as you can, you know?
1:35:41
And functional.
1:35:42
I’d rather see this kind of furniture than the IKEA living room any day.
1:35:48
Nothing against IKEA, just a cultural reference for the sake of the record.
1:35:53
That’s right [laughs]
1:35:55
. I’ve never even been into an IKEA store.
1:35:57
I guess I’ve just heard it on TV too much.
1:36:00
Exactly.
1:36:01
By the way, an aside completely, I was going to ask you earlier since you said
1:36:05
most of your family’s from Houston, right?
1:36:08
Relatives, yeah.
1:36:10
I bet you they were pretty excited about the Astros winning the World Series?
1:36:13
Oh yeah.
1:36:13
Wasn’t that great?
1:36:13
Did you see that?
1:36:13
Oh yeah.
1:36:15
Well
1:36:19
I first heard it from her—my sister—she was in here; the Astros took it!
1:36:24
They got it!
1:36:26
The World Series?
1:36:26
Hard to believe, huh Cathy?
1:36:28
Yes.
1:36:30
The first time ever.
1:36:30
I know, from the Colt 45s in 1962.
1:36:34
That was their first name, you
1:36:37
know?
1:36:37
The Houston Colt 45s.
1:36:37
They needed it after that Hurricane Harvey, you know?
1:36:41
Nothing like pumping a city back up.
1:36:45
I remember I watched the weather channel a lot because I think it’s
1:36:49
one of the great stations that we got.
1:36:53
They’re information, they’re funny, but really, they save lives.
1:36:56
They were saying, my God, this hurricane just blew up and they said we are afraid
1:37:03
because this thing is going to go straight here, and it has so much moisture.
1:37:07
It wasn’t a heavy wind hurricane, well, it was heavy, but they were worried
1:37:13
about it just stalling and dumping, and that’s exactly what happened.
1:37:18
Exactly what it did.
1:37:19
It was devastating.
1:37:20
The wind wasn’t nothing compared to what the water did.
1:37:24
Well, if you look historically at tropical storms and hurricanes, whether it’s in
1:37:27
the Pacific or in the Atlantic Basin or even in the Indian Ocean, it’s usually the
1:37:33
water that does the most damage and kills the most people because people always
1:37:39
focus on the category level—oh my God it’s a category 5 the winds, which is terrible.
1:37:45
But it’s usually the water.
1:37:47
Right.
1:37:47
But anyway, that was a feel-good story for all of the folks down there, huh?
1:37:51
Oh yeah.
1:37:53
That pumped them up.
1:37:55
There’s no team in New Orleans except football and basketball now.
1:37:58
Right.
1:38:00
I bet you a lot of people in your part of the world gravitate
1:38:03
toward the Houston teams, right?
1:38:04
Oh, absolutely.
1:38:04
Oh yeah.
1:38:05
The Rockets, the Astros, and now the Texans in football and
1:38:09
I think they even got a, they don’t have a hockey team anymore.
1:38:12
I don’t think so.
1:38:13
No, I don’t think so.
1:38:16
I was rooting for Houston, Cathy.
1:38:19
Yay.
1:38:20
Usually I root for the West Coast teams, but I liked the story about uplifting
1:38:26
a community, because sports, sometimes it matters so much because it doesn’t
1:38:30
matter, and it brings communities together and rescues their emotions,
1:38:35
even if it’s for a short period of time.
1:38:39
I thought they really deserved it.
1:38:41
I really liked their team.
1:38:43
Their best player is 5’6”: José Altuve.
1:38:47
I mean, he’s this little guy who can hit the ball a mile.
1:38:51
It’s
1:38:54
pretty amazing.
1:38:55
It was.
1:38:56
It was an amazing story.
1:38:59
Anyway, we’re back.
1:39:01
You’re understanding it’s always for the sake of the science in
1:39:04
terms of to support the science.
1:39:06
Yep.
1:39:08
Now, the campus is constructed – the one we see here.
1:39:12
And we’ve still seen a couple of additions to that.
1:39:15
How did the culture from what you saw—because you’re out here in your
1:39:19
maintaining and you’re interfacing with all those—how would you characterize
1:39:24
the culture of the Andrews changing and transitioning as it went from a bunch of
1:39:29
ramshackle trailers and the gray barn to a pretty sophisticated research facility
1:39:35
and residential community, if you will?
1:39:38
How do you remember seeing the culture of the place change from your perspective?
1:39:42
Wow.
1:39:43
I don’t really see it.
1:39:46
Really?
1:39:49
Yeah, it happened so subtle, little by little.
1:39:50
The same professional attitude that was here in ghetto in
1:39:54
the meadow is still here.
1:39:56
They’ve always had a high level of professional endeavor.
1:40:03
Expectations and standards, right?
1:40:05
Yeah.
1:40:06
I mean more generally the culture of the place.
1:40:10
I mean when you get a sophisticated facility like this and you’re able to
1:40:14
host students and groups and seminars—
1:40:17
No, no, we’re still blue collar.
1:40:22
I don’t think we’ll ever go white collar.
1:40:24
That’s not what I meant.
1:40:25
Oh.
1:40:25
I was just trying to say—and perhaps it’s the kind of question that you
1:40:30
can only answer maybe from like the perspective you’re are right now,
1:40:33
where you’re retiring and you’re leaving, and you can only look
1:40:37
back through the lens of 35 years.
1:40:39
Right.
1:40:42
Well, I see the young blood coming in
1:40:47
and I’m impressed.
1:40:49
There’s been talk on the radio and TV, you know, the old adults are
1:40:56
really concerned about the new adults.
1:40:59
The young adults coming into the workforce where they have no desire
1:41:05
whatsoever to get callouses on their hands, and all that kind of hoopla.
1:41:11
It’s not really true.
1:41:14
What I’ve seen, and sure there’s some out there, yeah.
1:41:18
They don’t want to walk the woods.
1:41:21
The want to stay on the keyboard.
1:41:22
Well, that’s fine.
1:41:24
But, from where I’ve seen these young people they are not afraid to roll up
1:41:29
their sleeves and get the job done.
1:41:33
Most of them I’ve seen enjoy it.
1:41:36
It’s been a great bunch of kids.
1:41:38
These new kids coming in, at least here, no complaint,
1:41:44
even the partiers are low-key.
1:41:46
They’re just young professionals.
1:41:50
They party but they don’t get crazy party and I’ve been really
1:41:54
impressed with the young people.
1:41:56
I feel good about it.
1:41:57
I feel good about the days ahead for this place, because they seem
1:42:03
to have strong hearts for what they believe in and they’re ready to do it.
1:42:11
Most people go into academic endeavors in science and history, generally
1:42:17
they’re doing it because they have some interest in doing something
1:42:20
better or learning something important.
1:42:24
That’s a generalization, but I think you could say there is a core there.
1:42:30
They have an ethic and a perspective on the world which has a degree
1:42:34
of altruism and love for something built into their environmental and
1:42:41
spiritual constructs, if you will.
1:42:44
I see hippie-ism is still here and I think it’s going to get stronger.
1:42:49
I don’t think the hippie era will ever go away.
1:42:54
In fact, the younger generation, they will take it a step further.
1:43:00
They will.
1:43:00
They’re going to fight.
1:43:02
They’re going to fight for, just like the hippies did in the ‘60s and ‘70s.
1:43:07
The counter-cultural revolution meant a lot more than just what
1:43:10
we often refer to as hippies.
1:43:12
Yes, that’s right.
1:43:13
Which is a specific aesthetic and look.
1:43:15
I’m using that term kind of loosely, but you know what I mean.
1:43:17
No, I understand.
1:43:19
Even one of my favorite comedians, Bill Maher, says the
1:43:23
first hippie was Jesus [laughs]
1:43:25
. Exactly, yeah.
1:43:26
You know what I’m saying.
1:43:27
Exactly.
1:43:27
Counter-cultural.
1:43:30
Pharisees get out of the temple [laughs] . The money changers
1:43:33
get out of the temple man.
1:43:35
Start walking your talk.
1:43:38
I mean really, it’s—I always use it to refer to positively progressive
1:43:43
counter-cultural ideas and practices.
1:43:46
Right.
1:43:47
In terms of hippie-ism, or whatever you want to call it.
1:43:50
There’s always been people like that, it just, we crystallize
1:43:54
it in our mind because there’s a certain look to the hippies.
1:43:57
I remember, Terry, when I was 10 or 9, my parents and I, we went to San Francisco
1:44:06
during the Summer of Love in ’67.
1:44:10
The famous one at Haight-Ashbury and all the Monterey Pop Festivals that year down
1:44:16
south and I was this little straight-laced little Christian kid and my sister, and
1:44:23
I counted hippies the whole time, like they were an invasive species [laughs]
1:44:28
. Right [laughs]
1:44:30
. We went down to Haight-Ashbury and we were all counting them all and
1:44:33
going look at all these weird people because back in ’67, they were
1:44:38
developing the iconography of what hippies were supposed to look like.
1:44:43
And we were in San Francisco.
1:44:49
I never understood the cultural essence behind that really until many years later
1:44:55
until I went through my own crazy era, which I don’t call my hippie era because
1:44:59
I was a troubled kid who was trying to escape from some pain I went through.
1:45:04
I became my own version of hippie, I describe it as bohemian, really in the
1:45:08
‘80s and ‘90s as I developed as an adult.
1:45:12
That was my hippie years and they’re kind of continuing in a certain way now.
1:45:16
Why would I have become a historian?
1:45:18
[laughs]
1:45:19
. Right.
1:45:21
That’s not a linear, straight-line thing that Mom and Dad say you need
1:45:25
to grow up to be a history professor and go out and try to find a job.
1:45:30
Good luck on that, son.
1:45:31
Anyway,
1:45:34
so you feel good about the future, though, of the new generation?
1:45:39
I really do, yeah.
1:45:43
I think they’re going to do quite well.
1:45:47
I think they’re going to voice their concerns real well.
1:45:51
Now,
1:45:54
what was the first artistic statement you made here at the Andrews.
1:45:59
You’re consumed with the practical, survival things of keeping this
1:46:03
place going, both in the field and down here, what’s the first
1:46:09
artistic thing you did that you’re proud of that’s maybe still here?
1:46:13
Well, that would be some of the apartment—well, like in Quartz I threw
1:46:17
in a few extra features, like the arches.
1:46:22
I love those Spanish arches over the kitchen, dining room,
1:46:26
some of the bathrooms I even put in little Spanish arches.
1:46:32
Little accent features like that.
1:46:34
I just, I can’t help it.
1:46:35
I got to do something like that.
1:46:38
Some of the wood work was handcrafted.
1:46:42
You used wood from out here in the field, right?
1:46:44
Some of it, yeah.
1:46:45
Or did you have to bring hardwood from somewhere else, sometimes right?
1:46:50
Some of it was milled.
1:46:50
But, yeah, a lot at that time, a lot of it was just coming out
1:46:55
of town, out of the lumber yard.
1:46:59
We would mold—we got into molding our own designs of
1:47:06
trim, interior trim, like the baseboards and door trim, cabinet trim, all your
1:47:14
cabinet edges and anyway—we did a lot of
1:47:20
handcrafting, especially in Roswell and Rainbow.
1:47:28
We bought into the cheapo, they call them knockdown cabinets.
1:47:32
They’re like cabinet kits.
1:47:33
They come in a box and you put them together.
1:47:36
Right, yeah, I’ve done that before.
1:47:39
That’s what we did in the Quartz building and I decided I didn’t want to do that.
1:47:43
So, when we got to Roswell and Rainbow we started a lot of
1:47:49
them were hand-built instead of
1:47:54
knockdowns, store-bought.
1:47:55
Tilework, I shifted from FORMICA to countertop tile just for
1:48:02
the artistic aesthetics of it.
1:48:04
It would last longer, too, right?
1:48:05
If it was done well.
1:48:07
I was disappointed when I came in one day and somebody had sat
1:48:13
a frying pan that must have been too hot right on top of the—
1:48:18
Formica.
1:48:19
Formica, right, next to the range.
1:48:20
It’ll burn it, yeah.
1:48:21
It not only burned it, it blistered like that big an area.
1:48:27
That’s hard to do that on real tile, though.
1:48:29
You can put—
1:48:31
That’s right.
1:48:31
Pretty hot dang stuff on it.
1:48:32
It can take a lot of abuse, yeah.
1:48:36
So, we got into that kind of work.
1:48:39
I hung
1:48:42
some of the paintings I did in the old cafeteria trailer.
1:48:48
There was nothing.
1:48:49
Just blank walls.
1:48:50
Nobody was taking any interest in making the dining area more friendly, more warm.
1:49:00
Less utilitarian, right?
1:49:03
Yeah, well, one of our caterers commented on it one day.
1:49:09
In fact, she volunteered, she said Terry I’d like to make
1:49:12
some drapes for the windows.
1:49:14
I want to make some—at least put drapes on the windows to give
1:49:18
it a warmer atmosphere in here.
1:49:21
Knock yourself out, babe.
1:49:22
That’d be wonderful.
1:49:23
I’d love to have somebody do that.
1:49:26
In the meantime, I got to thinking, “Okay. Let’s do some paintings, just some quick
1:49:33
paintings and hang them up in the dining area, in the hallway, in the bathroom,
1:49:38
in the bedroom, because at that time—“
1:49:39
That’s when you started doing your own paintings, at least in terms of how you
1:49:43
were envisioning them as being part of the aesthetic of the property, right?
1:49:48
Yeah.
1:49:48
That’s where it started was in that old cafeteria building, cafeteria trailer.
1:49:55
So, it was for a trailer at first, then?
1:49:57
I created a bunch of them and hung them in there.
1:49:58
The trailer at first though, right.
1:50:00
Yeah, it was just the trailer at first.
1:50:02
Yeah.
1:50:07
One conference they had it was on a weekend and Art McKee was up
1:50:12
here with the conference and they were having their first lunch.
1:50:19
I think it was lunch.
1:50:21
The first meal was lunch, catered.
1:50:24
This one lady took one look at the paintings of the wall and
1:50:28
ran outside blubbering, crying.
1:50:31
Just broke down in tears.
1:50:33
Art said he ran out.
1:50:34
I heard about this later.
1:50:36
He said he ran out and confronted her: what’s wrong?
1:50:42
Can I help.
1:50:43
She said, oh, no I was just—I saw that painting of the tigers and I had painted
1:50:50
the tiger family from a postcard.
1:50:54
I just thought it was a tremendous picture.
1:50:57
A beautiful view.
1:50:59
Well, her husband had photographed those tigers in India and had died
1:51:06
in a hunting accident over there.
1:51:08
So, you painted the painting from the photograph that her husband took?
1:51:13
Who knew!
1:51:14
Yes.
1:51:17
My first response when you said she cried when she saw your art, I
1:51:21
was going to make a joke about it.
1:51:23
Because I was like okay.
1:51:25
But now I understand that’s really—talk about coincidence.
1:51:29
That was amazing that somebody—I mean of all the pictures I
1:51:33
picked out to do a painting of,
1:51:37
it had to be that one.
1:51:39
Then she was okay.
1:51:40
She said, no, no.
1:51:42
It brought back memories, that’s all.
1:51:44
I guess.
1:51:48
That’s one of those pinch-me moments where you just go—
1:51:51
Yeah, yeah.
1:51:52
What is this?
1:51:52
There are forces that I don’t understand, right?
1:51:55
Exactly.
1:51:57
Yeah that was very unusual, very strange.
1:52:04
Back to my artwork on the facility that ties in with the facility,
1:52:10
one of the other features is the mural on the back wall of the stage.
1:52:16
I was going to ask you about that, yeah.
1:52:19
That was a fly-by-night backdrop for the stage for the Andrews
1:52:24
50th celebration in ’98.
1:52:25
That was 1998, right.
1:52:32
I had the whole thing set up.
1:52:33
It was a lot bigger than it is now.
1:52:35
We had to cut it down to make it fit that back wall.
1:52:38
So, you actually did it over here?
1:52:41
I did it in the truck bay.
1:52:43
I had it all set up.
1:52:44
I was painting after hours.
1:52:47
I didn’t want to do it on company time, and it was 2:00 in the morning
1:52:51
Art McKee came over and he says you’re going to go get some sleep, right?
1:52:57
You’re going to go take a break and go get some sleep before you finish this?
1:53:01
I said, yeah Art I’m almost to a point where I can stop with it.
1:53:05
But after he left I was on a roll.
1:53:08
I didn’t want to stop.
1:53:10
I couldn’t stop.
1:53:12
So, I just stayed with it.
1:53:14
At 6:00 I was done with it.
1:53:16
I put like 8 hours, no it’d be more like 12 hours into that
1:53:21
painting and it was a great hit.
1:53:26
Perfect stage drop.
1:53:28
We were trying to hide the stage was in front of the end of Rainbow
1:53:33
Building out beyond the pavilion.
1:53:36
We were trying to hide that old ugly wall of the Rainbow Building.
1:53:40
Right.
1:53:41
It served the purpose for that.
1:53:44
Though I didn’t have no place to store it, so I was just going
1:53:47
to haul it to the burn pile.
1:53:49
Art McKee says, he says, no you’re not.
1:53:53
I said, well Art where are we going to put it.
1:53:56
He said well let me think about it.
1:53:58
Take it to the truck bay for now.
1:54:01
He says let’s do this: you think you can cut it down and still make it
1:54:08
look good for the stage backdrop.
1:54:10
How about if we do that?
1:54:12
I said yeah that would look pretty cool.
1:54:15
We could use some of our cedar boards, Andrews cedar, for the edging on
1:54:20
each side to kind of tie in the wood theme, you know, the forest theme with
1:54:25
natural cedar that looked similar to logs, but anyway—yeah, we’ll do that.
1:54:33
Then one day about a month later he comes and gets me and says
1:54:37
Terry you got to come look at this.
1:54:39
He drags me out to the conference hall, turns all the lights off, hits the stage
1:54:46
lights, the kind that come on gradually.
1:54:50
That thing just exploded.
1:54:52
It was like it came alive.
1:54:55
So, he put it in there?
1:54:57
He did that, yeah.
1:54:59
He did that.
1:55:00
I bet that surprised the heck out
1:55:04
of him.
1:55:04
It blew my mind.
1:55:04
I said, Art all I can say is that’s a happy accident
1:55:09
[laughs]
1:55:09
. That was a kind of a happenstance.
1:55:10
That was just a real quick thing.
1:55:13
I used regular house painting brushes.
1:55:16
I wasn’t even using art brushes, just some—
1:55:19
Well, that’s on a big scale, too.
1:55:22
I wasn’t trying for anything special other than something to hide an ugly building.
1:55:28
Did you ever touch it up after it went up, or that’s the original?
1:55:31
No, I trimmed it down to fit that wall and you’re looking at it the
1:55:35
way it came out of the truck bay.
1:55:37
And how did you get—did you have a photograph, or did
1:55:40
you just imagine the forest?
1:55:42
I had a photograph that Al Levno had taken.
1:55:47
It’s someplace on Lookout Creek and he won’t tell nobody where it is.
1:55:52
Okay.
1:55:53
He calls it his secret place.
1:55:55
So, it is a place, okay.
1:55:56
Yes.
1:55:56
It’s on Lookout Creek somewhere.
1:55:59
Did you ever have a name for that, or no?
1:56:02
No.
1:56:02
I mean you know it wasn’t anything particular.
1:56:08
I never named—just happy accident would be a good name for it.
1:56:12
Happy accident.
1:56:14
Sometimes the artist gets a happy accident.
1:56:17
Well, a lot of the wonderful things in life are serendipitous.
1:56:21
Exactly.
1:56:22
Interesting in how they wind their way to actually happening.
1:56:25
Like the Astros.
1:56:29
Well, yeah.
1:56:29
You
1:56:33
know.
1:56:33
Who would have known?
1:56:34
I know, who would have guessed.
1:56:37
Okay, keep going.
1:56:39
That’s the story on that guy.
1:56:43
You did—there’s the sculpture out front of the main building, correct?
1:56:52
Out front of the main building?
1:56:54
The office—isn’t there a sculpture that you did?
1:56:59
You talking about the monument?
1:57:00
Yeah.
1:57:01
In front of the flag pole?
1:57:02
I think so, yeah.
1:57:03
Oh yeah.
1:57:04
Well, that was a joint effort.
1:57:08
Art wanted to set up that old plaque, that bronze plaque, put
1:57:13
it out by the—what is that anyway?
1:57:15
Biosphere
1:57:18
Research Program?
1:57:19
Well, yeah, it became International Biosphere
1:57:24
site.
1:57:25
There’s been several designations.
1:57:27
So, we got awarded with that big bronze plaque and he wanted it
1:57:30
mounted on something, so I said, well, I’ll see what I can do.
1:57:37
I found, I’m going to
1:57:40
town one day.
1:57:42
On the side of road 15 down towards the highway, a big section
1:57:49
of rock had slid off a cliff.
1:57:53
Big section of rock.
1:57:55
I thought, man, that would be perfect, but how in the world
1:57:58
could we get it to the Andrews?
1:58:00
Because we’re talking a couple tons, right?
1:58:02
Oh yeah, because what you’re seeing is only 2/3 of the total rock, you know?
1:58:08
There’s at least 1/3 down in the ground, because we sunk it just to bed it good.
1:58:16
I call up,
1:58:20
Wild Bill.
1:58:21
That was his name.
1:58:23
Blue River Ranger Station, Wild Bill was a road maintenance
1:58:29
crew, heavy equipment operator.
1:58:33
I’m talking to him about it and he says you know what I bet we got just the thing
1:58:37
that’ll—we won’t be able to carry it, but I bet we can drag it, or push it.
1:58:43
They had one of these front-end loaders that twist in the middle kind of tractor.
1:58:48
So, you pushed it all the way up the—
1:58:49
He pushed it from about 1 mile down the road, Road 15.
1:58:58
That was okay until he got to the bridge and he started pushing it
1:59:02
across the bridge and the whole bridge was just vibrating like
1:59:07
somebody with coffee jitters [laughs]
1:59:11
. We’re talking 5 tons of rock and we’re raising a cloud of dust.
1:59:15
It’s the middle of summer and he’s leaving a streak on the blacktop
1:59:19
about 8’ across of rock dust.
1:59:26
By the time he got it to where I wanted to put it in the ground it
1:59:30
was completely flat on the face, or what we decided to call the face.
1:59:35
Because you scraped it all off.
1:59:36
He had completely polished it.
1:59:39
By the time it got to Andrews it was perfect.
1:59:42
It couldn’t have been more perfect.
1:59:45
The only thing Art said, he says, Terry that is porous rock, it’s only
1:59:50
going to last a couple of years.
1:59:51
You went to all that trouble for a 2-year monument.
1:59:56
I said, Art, that thing is so big it’ll be splitting for 100 years before it fails.
2:00:04
I was right.
2:00:05
It’s still hanging in there.
2:00:07
But I mean technically he’s right.
2:00:09
It’s a real porous clay rock, so every winter you get the
2:00:14
freeze thaw and it splits.
2:00:16
You get some fracture cracks and stuff.
2:00:17
Yeah fracture cracks and another piece flakes off.
2:00:20
In 100 years, it’ll be worthless for a plaque.
2:00:25
But who cares, in 100 years put in a new rock.
2:00:29
That’s the story on that baby.
2:00:31
That’s pretty interesting.
2:00:34
That was hilarious watching Wild Bill.
2:00:38
The bucket on that tractor was huge.
2:00:40
Those big belly bin front-end loaders.
2:00:44
They’re big units anyway.
2:00:47
I’m going to say that was a 4-yard bucket on that thing.
2:00:51
Big, huge bucket.
2:00:53
He had no trouble pushing it.
2:00:55
Once he had it locked, it wasn’t going to slip anywhere.
2:00:59
But that bridge was a little scary.
2:01:01
The engineers weren’t real happy about that.
2:01:04
That you did that.
2:01:05
But somebody told somebody, right?
2:01:08
Well, one of them.
2:01:10
There was no hiding it.
2:01:11
There’s a trail all the way to our gravel driveway, you know?
2:01:19
[Laughs] Yeah, one of the engineers he just said Terry, he shook his head,
2:01:23
you’re just lucky that thing did not rupture that bridge because a rock
2:01:29
that heavy could have ruptured it.
2:01:31
May not have collapsed it, but it could have—
2:01:34
Somebody would have been—
2:01:35
What do they call it?
2:01:36
Structural integrity would have been—
2:01:39
Compromised.
2:01:41
Yep.
2:01:42
Well, lucky for all of you guys or you would have ended up in
2:01:46
a little bit of trouble there.
2:01:47
Oh yeah.
2:01:48
Well, especially considering that road is really important to getting into
2:01:51
the back country, not just the Andrews.
2:01:51
Yeah, it’s the main vein.
2:01:54
I know.
2:01:55
You can go all the way over to Santiam by going—
2:01:59
That’s right.
2:02:00
Wow.
2:02:00
That’s a great story, man.
2:02:02
That’s really something else.
2:02:05
That’s how the rock got up there.
2:02:07
It was pushed like, what, two miles or something?
2:02:09
Yeah.
2:02:10
Close to it.
2:02:11
How long did it take?
2:02:13
Maybe a mile and a half, but anyway.
2:02:15
How long?
2:02:16
Because it was kind of slow, you know.
2:02:18
He wasn’t in no hurry.
2:02:19
About two to three, four hours?
2:02:20
No, I’m going to say two hours.
2:02:21
Two hours?
2:02:21
Yeah.
2:02:22
Okay.
2:02:23
Wow.
2:02:23
That is a great story.
2:02:28
Now, you were not here for the ’64 flood, obviously, but you
2:02:32
were here for the 1996 flood.
2:02:33
Oh, man, what a mess.
2:02:35
Tell me about the damage that it did, what you saw during the storm
2:02:40
and the debris flows and the floods and what did that do in terms of
2:02:45
the infrastructure and how did you, really everybody, had to address that?
2:02:52
First of all, I didn’t know it was going to be that severe.
2:02:55
Our people knew that it had the potential to be that severe, but they
2:03:02
weren’t letting the word out about it.
2:03:04
Are you talking about the rain that they expected?
2:03:06
Yeah, the amount of moisture on top of the snow, that warm rain on top of the snow.
2:03:10
Right, right.
2:03:10
The
2:03:13
snow was not frozen, so they had a feeling it was going to
2:03:17
be the big one, the big one.
2:03:21
They’re kind of watching the data loggers in Corvallis, you know?
2:03:26
Watching the weather reports, and about, I can’t remember now, 10:00/11:00 they
2:03:33
decided they needed to get down here.
2:03:36
But in the meantime, the storm’s in full force, and I’ll never forget it
2:03:43
because we had high winds with it, too.
2:03:48
We’re sitting here in the house—this wasn’t part of the house, this
2:03:52
was just a porch back then, but we were sitting in the living room—me,
2:03:56
my daughter, and my wife—and I’m hearing all kinds of weird noises.
2:04:00
We had a dog at that time, so I decided to go outside and
2:04:05
see if I could see anything.
2:04:08
The dog went with me.
2:04:09
I took my flashlight and we started off towards the creek.
2:04:13
I’m hearing boulders, they had to have been big, and it’s going: kaboom, boom,
2:04:19
boom, crash, boom and then the surging water sound and the trees are whipping
2:04:26
and snapping and all of a sudden, we hear something huge go snap, crackle, pop,
2:04:32
and before I knew it the dog was gone.
2:04:34
She was gone.
2:04:35
Scared, right?
2:04:36
Yes.
2:04:36
Then I turned around I was right behind her.
2:04:40
I come in the house and I said girls, get your stuff we’re sleeping in the shop.
2:04:45
So, we did.
2:04:46
We slept in the shop that night.
2:04:47
Because you thought you were too close to the watershed here on the side?
2:04:50
To the trees and the creek.
2:04:52
Yeah, right, okay.
2:04:53
I didn’t want the girls to be that close to this mess going on, so we slept in
2:05:00
the shop that night and the next morning
2:05:06
the girls came home and I’m at work at the shop.
2:05:09
They come and talk to me and said we got to go take a look at the
2:05:15
Watershed 3 because the road is collapsing, it’s taking out the road.
2:05:20
It hasn’t gone yet, but it’s fixing to.
2:05:23
We had to go up there with the snow—we took the snowcat because Al was hoping,
2:05:29
Al Levno, was hoping to get the snowcat across before the road collapsed so that
2:05:34
at least we would have transportation to get up into the snow studies.
2:05:39
Because wasn’t this in February?
2:05:41
Yes.
2:05:43
The storm in ’64/’65 was actually December and even going into January a little bit.
2:05:50
Same principle.
2:05:50
Yeah.
2:05:52
They were calling it déjà vu.
2:05:54
But ’96 happened a couple of months later, I believe, a month and a half later.
2:05:59
Yep.
2:06:01
You wanted to have something above the break point because if you didn’t
2:06:05
get it above it before it went there’s nothing you could have done in the
2:06:08
high country without, except walk.
2:06:10
Right, or hike in.
2:06:12
Well, you could have got maybe snowmobiles up there, maybe?
2:06:17
Not once the road collapsed.
2:06:20
But we did manage later to get a side passage
2:06:26
because, anyway, that comes later.
2:06:28
First of all, we did manage—everybody was scared to death.
2:06:33
Nobody wanted to take it across because it’s collapsing.
2:06:37
The snowcat?
2:06:37
It’s
2:06:39
undercutting the blacktop, but there’s still like an 8’ prong section of
2:06:45
the road that’s still hanging on.
2:06:48
The weight of the snowcat – is it going to take it out or not?
2:06:49
Along with the person in the snow cat.
2:06:50
Yeah,
2:06:54
exactly.
2:06:55
You would be a statistic at the bottom of the hill, right?
2:06:57
Yep.
2:07:00
So, finally one of our seasonal workers, Leroy Ray, he says,
2:07:06
alright, you guys just stand back.
2:07:08
I’ll take it.
2:07:09
I’ll get up on the high side and I’ll shoot it across as quick as I can.
2:07:13
Okay, go for it Leroy.
2:07:15
So, he did.
2:07:16
He managed to get it across before it collapsed.
2:07:19
And it did collapse, right?
2:07:21
Oh yeah, but it took about another, I’m going to say, another 3 hours before
2:07:27
it finally took it completely out.
2:07:31
Then, when everything settled down we got over and went and checked for more
2:07:40
damage, and yeah, everything was tore up.
2:07:42
The bridges were gone.
2:07:47
One was compromised, and one was completely
2:07:53
jacked out of position, dropped into the creek.
2:07:56
On Lookout?
2:07:57
Yeah, on Lookout Creek.
2:07:58
The one that crosses Lookout?
2:08:00
Wasn’t there a bridge on McRae, too?
2:08:02
That’s the one I’m thinking of, is the one where McRae hits the
2:08:07
confluence [with Lookout Creek]
2:08:08
. Right, right.
2:08:08
Yeah, the McRae confluence.
2:08:11
That’s the one that actually went out.
2:08:13
The first one that crosses Lookout was damaged but not ruined.
2:08:20
We deiced, okay, we need to get the snowmobiles out here, get them across the
2:08:24
creek and get them set up for winter work.
2:08:27
We did that.
2:08:29
There was another place after Watershed 3 on 1506 [Road] where it had washed
2:08:36
a channel through the gravel road, where the gravel road starts before
2:08:41
you got to the bridge on 1506.
2:08:42
Right.
2:08:44
So, we built the bridge across that, which was basically a foot bridge,
2:08:49
but we drove the snowmobiles over it, so we could get them on up there
2:08:53
past the bridge that was ruined.
2:08:57
We managed to get two snowmobiles up there, got them parked on the other
2:09:00
side of the creek for the winter work.
2:09:05
That’s how we found out that black bears love snowmobile seats.
2:09:11
Because they eat them?
2:09:12
They eat them.
2:09:13
They play with them.
2:09:15
They don’t swallow them.
2:09:16
They just play with them.
2:09:18
They rip them up.
2:09:19
Chew on them [laughs] . You see chunks—the reason we knew it was black
2:09:24
bears was because of the claw marks.
2:09:26
It wasn’t cougar.
2:09:28
Wow, so you had to basically ride these snowmobiles with no seat.
2:09:34
Exactly.
2:09:37
That must have been comfortable.
2:09:39
That was a
2:09:42
scary flood.
2:09:43
That was amazing.
2:09:44
That lasted about 2 days, or just 1 day.
2:09:47
It was basically just one day, and it was over.
2:09:50
That was the one where we found out later that the Army Corp of Engineers
2:09:57
made the statement that we were one hour away from releasing the dam.
2:10:05
There’s a point where you have to start letting water out.
2:10:07
The Blue River?
2:10:09
Yeah, the Blue River.
2:10:10
The reservoir.
2:10:12
They were 1 hour away.
2:10:14
If the rain would have continued another hour they were going to
2:10:17
have to start letting the water out, which would have made the river water
2:10:23
come up another foot and a half.
2:10:25
It was already starting to flood houses.
2:10:28
It had taken out two or three already.
2:10:31
You’re talking about McKenzie, right?
2:10:32
Yeah, McKenzie River.
2:10:33
Alright.
2:10:35
We lucked out.
2:10:36
It quit raining inside that one-hour window.
2:10:39
It stopped.
2:10:40
It was over.
2:10:42
The ’64 flood, which I do remember as a small kid, I’m sure it regionally,
2:10:50
especially was much more severe.
2:10:52
Yes, it was.
2:10:53
I mean I think this was not ice-laid, but the damage wasn’t as widespread.
2:10:58
Right.
2:10:58
I’m talking beyond the Andrews.
2:11:00
Right.
2:11:01
I remember when I was a kid and it was Christmas Eve or Christmas Day
2:11:07
because it happened right then.
2:11:10
My grandfather
2:11:15
was the pulp room foreman at Publishers Paper Mill which became
2:11:19
Blue Heron, if you’ve been up there.
2:11:22
It’s not anymore, and I remember hearing about the food and all the bridges, but
2:11:27
I was 6 years old and didn’t really know what all this meant except I knew there
2:11:30
was a lot of water everywhere, but I remember going to Publishers Paper Mill.
2:11:36
My grandfather took us down.
2:11:37
My sister and I and maybe my parents were with us.
2:11:40
The Willamette Falls are there.
2:11:43
[at Oregon City, Oregon] It’s got a cement structure there
2:11:45
now, too, was a gigantic rapid.
2:11:50
I just remember this giant rapid and the best thing I can reference from a
2:11:55
cultural perspective is you remember the African Queen when they would go through
2:12:00
that big cataract—it was on one of the African rivers and it had that—it wasn’t
2:12:06
really, it looked like a gigantic rapid like that except it was ripping away parts
2:12:10
of the mill and I just remember that.
2:12:13
That was ’64 and it just, yeah, it flooded the whole Willamette
2:12:17
Valley and knocked out half the bridges in the whole Cascade area.
2:12:20
A lot of them.
2:12:22
They told me that you know that little restaurant at Finn
2:12:26
Rock down here on the highway?
2:12:29
You’re talking about ’64, right?
2:12:31
In ’64 that was a store in ’64.
2:12:35
Well, right there that’s the low spot of the McKenzie River.
2:12:39
There [the flood crest] was 3’ above the blacktop.
2:12:43
Three feet over the blacktop.
2:12:46
That’s how high the river was up here.
2:12:48
That’s a lot.
2:12:48
Did Al Levno ever tell you his story about surviving that night?
2:12:53
Yes, he told me about it.
2:12:56
It was a terrifying story.
2:12:57
It was him and Dick Fredriksen, I think.
2:13:00
Yeah, that was one of them.
2:13:03
They had to crawl over mountains and trees were crashing and then they got
2:13:07
down to the valley, but they couldn’t get places because everything was
2:13:10
flooded and that was ’64 though.
2:13:13
I know it.
2:13:15
That was a mess.
2:13:16
I worked for a contractor in Eugene that had gone through it and he said he
2:13:24
was one of the ambulances, his truck.
2:13:28
He had a big, beefy 4-wheel drive.
2:13:32
He said that’s how deep the snow was in Eugene; the ambulances couldn’t drive.
2:13:39
They couldn’t handle transporting anybody.
2:13:43
So, they were hiring local 4-wheelers to come carry patients
2:13:49
here and there, you know?
2:13:51
So, he was an ambulance driver for three days.
2:13:54
Interesting.
2:13:55
Yeah, we were up in the south hills of Eugene, so any of the flooding in
2:13:59
Eugene was down more toward the river basin and the lower areas and stuff.
2:14:03
I can’t remember how much of the downtown that had got flooded or something.
2:14:07
But anyway, going back to the Andrews here.
2:14:11
In ’96 this flood happens, how much of the following year did you
2:14:15
and other people have to address all the damage that had happened?
2:14:19
Whether it be the gauging stations
2:14:23
and the flumes, the roads, the bridges.
2:14:25
Tell me about the reconstruction process of that.
2:14:29
It basically took a lot of your time and energy for probably the
2:14:32
better part of a year, right?
2:14:33
Yeah.
2:14:37
Like the gauging station was completely gone.
2:14:40
Watershed 3 Gauging Station, it was completely gone.
2:14:45
Al Levno found little bits and pieces of it out in the reservoir and that’s all.
2:14:51
That was just amazing that it could take a big building like that.
2:14:56
I mean, you know—a well-constructed structure and there’s nothing left
2:15:05
but one-foot chunks here and there.
2:15:09
Man!
2:15:10
The power of water is amazing.
2:15:12
Yeah it is.
2:15:14
The most dramatic examples to me recently have been, well, the Indonesia, Sumatra
2:15:21
Tsunami, but especially the Japanese one that happened 6 years ago in 2011.
2:15:27
Seeing what that did to all those—I mean huge ships and
2:15:33
buildings, big, tall buildings.
2:15:36
It’s amazing.
2:15:37
The power of water.
2:15:37
I know
2:15:40
it.
2:15:40
We think oh it’s soft, it’s water.
2:15:42
When water hits you like that it’s like getting hit by a rock.
2:15:45
Exactly.
2:15:47
That’s the way it was with that situation.
2:15:51
Anyway, it didn’t impact us too much time-wise in the beginning, because
2:15:58
the first thing you had to do was go to contract for road access repair.
2:16:03
And that had to be Forest Service related because they
2:16:06
were Forest Service roads, right?
2:16:08
Yeah, Forest Service took care of that part.
2:16:11
And of course, that all takes time, you know.
2:16:14
I’m going to say
2:16:18
it was probably not until the next,
2:16:23
no it was that season, it was that summer, yeah.
2:16:26
So, the summer after ’96 they were dealing with the bridge and the road
2:16:30
repair, so the situation could be more or less normal again in terms of access.
2:16:35
Right, yeah.
2:16:36
Then we went in and rebuilt the gauging station.
2:16:42
Facility maintenance was heavily involved in that.
2:16:48
That was basically in-house reconstruction.
2:16:53
That’s about it.
2:16:54
We had some of our other ice-related research stations needed to have a little
2:17:00
bit of repair, but it was pretty minor.
2:17:03
It
2:17:05
was mostly road damage and complete gut-out of the creek.
2:17:12
That was so sad, man.
2:17:15
The Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife they had just spent that whole previous
2:17:22
summer putting in new fish habitats on Lookout Creek with the logs and cable
2:17:31
anchors to keep everything in position.
2:17:36
Every bit of it completely gone.
2:17:39
Just gutted out clean.
2:17:42
Starting over.
2:17:44
Thousands and thousands of dollars just swept away in a few hours.
2:17:50
Speaking of other natural disasters, a much more severe one, I’ve
2:17:54
been talking to the people that worked down there at Luquillo, you
2:17:58
know the Puerto Rico LTER site?
2:18:02
Yep.
2:18:02
Hurricane Maria.
2:18:03
Oh yeah.
2:18:04
A Category 5 hurricane
2:18:06
basically destroyed the whole island, and I’ve heard that—well, let’s put it
2:18:12
this way, a lot of stuff got damaged.
2:18:17
They have a lot of similar issues as you would have here.
2:18:21
It’s a tropical system versus a temperate zone system, but yeah, I
2:18:26
mean I’m sure they and the Terrys of that place are working their butts off.
2:18:33
Pretty overwhelmed, yeah.
2:18:35
I bet you they are.
2:18:35
You need all the help you can find.
2:18:37
That’s even more large-scale because the hurricane didn’t spare anything.
2:18:41
It wasn’t just along creek beds, it was everywhere.
2:18:45
I mean, the creek beds were bad, but also the trees are stripped,
2:18:47
everything’s knocked over.
2:18:49
So, I can only imagine what they’re dealing with.
2:18:51
It takes a lot of team effort, you know.
2:18:53
I still had my crew on the job.
2:18:58
Everybody contributed and got
2:19:05
it done.
2:19:05
In terms of the infrastructure out in the field, Terry, and you can start with
2:19:10
the water gauging stations, anything like that, but also the weather stations:
2:19:15
Central Met, Vanilla Met, how did you see that you needed to improve the structure
2:19:23
of the housings, even the protection mechanisms that you got around them
2:19:27
because of the snow, even having them as a secondary emergency shelter facility.
2:19:34
Tell me about how improving those and how you thought about designing
2:19:38
those for practical reasons in addition to their science.
2:19:48
It mostly has to do with
2:19:52
living in the environment and learning what that environment demands.
2:19:58
It doesn’t take long before you begin to realize that there’s certain
2:20:03
structure designs that just won’t function well in this kind of country.
2:20:08
Give me a for example.
2:20:09
We got long periods of not just rain but cold dampness.
2:20:18
There’s places all
2:20:21
around the facility and in the field where it’s not going to see
2:20:27
dryness, it won’t dry out until June.
2:20:32
You’ve got from October to June everything’s going to be wet all the time.
2:20:40
Very few dry spells.
2:20:42
I’m not talking about rain, just dampness.
2:20:45
Heavy dews, cold temperatures.
2:20:48
Just the high dew point and the high humidity in general, right.
2:20:51
It can do—anything you design that has a potential of building a marsh trap
2:21:00
you’re going to pay for it down the line.
2:21:01
With mold or rust or both?
2:21:03
Mold, rust, the moisture will wick, I call it wicking if it gets underneath a
2:21:11
shallow slope it’s not going to damage just that particular spot, it’s going to
2:21:17
keep wicking just like a cancer, it grows.
2:21:21
It reaches farther and farther because it has so much extended time of dampness.
2:21:26
It doesn’t dry out, so it’s got a perfect environment to destroy whatever you build.
2:21:35
Consequently, your roof has to have a decent slope.
2:21:40
You’re not going to get away with zero overhang.
2:21:43
It’s going to get you in the end.
2:21:46
This place and the old cabin had spots on it where it had zero overhang because
2:21:54
some of our older people, I won’t mention any names, love the salt box style of
2:22:03
construction that you see in New England, places like that, on the northeast coast.
2:22:11
Well, that’s fine for that environment because they get those
2:22:13
extended spells of dry out time.
2:22:18
That works for that place but not here.
2:22:23
Well, even if you were on the east slope of the Cascades you might be
2:22:25
able to get away with it, right?
2:22:26
Yeah.
2:22:27
Because it’s a completely different climate regime here than on the other
2:22:31
side of the Santiam and McKenzie pass, for
2:22:36
instance.
2:22:36
Another for example besides structures is surface drainage.
2:22:41
People
2:22:44
first thought that this ground is so porous that we’ll never
2:22:50
have surface drainage problems.
2:22:51
Well, that’s not the case.
2:22:54
I’ve seen a foot of water standing on top of the pavilion down there.
2:23:00
I’m sorry, 6” of water.
2:23:02
You mean on the floor there, right?
2:23:04
Because the surface drainage couldn’t get out.
2:23:06
Okay.
2:23:07
So, you have to deal with that.
2:23:08
You have to plan your landscape to allow for drainage, surface drainage.
2:23:16
Once your ground saturated the water still has got to go somewhere.
2:23:21
And it’s going to go somewhere.
2:23:23
It will just stand there and build up into a swimming pool
2:23:28
if it doesn’t get a way out.
2:23:32
Yeah, it’s a lot of learning experience for me.
2:23:36
Over a period of time I’ve learned that you not only have to design those
2:23:42
features you have to maintain them, because in some situations like our
2:23:47
surface drainage, they have to constantly be revisited and reestablished or you’ll
2:23:58
get hit hard
2:24:01
with heavy
2:24:06
rain or the ’96 flood.
2:24:06
You get warm rain on top of warm snow and something’s going to happen.
2:24:15
Mother nature plays a critical role.
2:24:18
Snowpack.
2:24:19
We always have to bear in mind whether it’s a field station or another
2:24:25
structure on the facility you have to allow for snow compaction, snowpack.
2:24:39
All our roofs are designed to meet a minimum of 48”
2:24:47
snowpack at 80% saturation per square foot.
2:24:52
The roofs that are put in place here as well as your foundation
2:24:58
and wall structures are designed to hold a major snowpack.
2:25:05
Stuff
2:25:08
like that.
2:25:09
Mother nature, like I say, she’s got a critical role in design.
2:25:14
When you came from Louisiana to Oregon and you were in construction before and
2:25:17
then you came up here after you’d been basically back and forth for 10 years,
2:25:23
what things did you have to unlearn?
2:25:25
Granted, Louisiana there’s a lot of moisture, but it’s a lot
2:25:28
warmer and it’s not mountainous.
2:25:32
What did you have to unlearn in terms of learning the things you just told
2:25:35
me about in terms of how the moisture regime affects things differently here.
2:25:44
In fact, that’s what I’m going to be facing going back to Louisiana.
2:25:47
I have to unlearn
2:25:50
the style of construction here that
2:25:55
would be a reverse role in Louisiana.
2:26:00
For instance, I just learned that they don’t use fresh air returns
2:26:05
to HVAC systems because of the high humidity down there in Louisiana.
2:26:11
You just don’t do that because you’re just pumping in more moist
2:26:15
air for the air handlers to handle.
2:26:19
Well, in Oregon that’s the law.
2:26:21
That’s a code.
2:26:22
You have to provide a certain amount of CFM fresh air to your systems.
2:26:30
I’m going to go down to Louisiana and do that.
2:26:33
I had my doubts, I wondered.
2:26:37
Because we are having issues in our attic of Mom’s house with condensation
2:26:43
getting into the cabinets, heavy moisture.
2:26:48
I kept thinking it needs fresh air.
2:26:52
But the fresh air there has got heavier, wetter air, right?
2:26:56
Yeah.
2:26:57
Warm.
2:26:58
The system needs fresh air into it, but then she—I told her call
2:27:04
around to the professionals and find out if that could be the problem.
2:27:10
She did, and they said no, we don’t, not in Louisiana.
2:27:14
You don’t use fresh air intakes.
2:27:17
More than likely your problem is you have the cavity above your cabinets
2:27:22
that’s trapping the warm attic air and you have your AC going on high during
2:27:28
the summer and that’s your condensation reaction and then now, and she says, well
2:27:34
how come it never was a problem before?
2:27:36
Because it took that long to work its way down to the groceries in the cabinet.
2:27:44
Does it need a new roof?
2:27:46
We already did that.
2:27:48
Okay.
2:27:48
We beefed up the insulation in the attic.
2:27:51
Put on a new roof and we checked for leaks to make sure that it wasn’t any
2:27:58
kind of a roof leak, and it’s not.
2:28:02
The attic is well-ventilated.
2:28:04
And
2:28:06
he’s probably right.
2:28:08
We’ll address it when I get down there.
2:28:13
The same way when I came up here.
2:28:15
I didn’t know nothing about fresh-air intakes.
2:28:18
I didn’t put no fresh-air intakes in our early systems, so we had
2:28:22
to come through years down the road and put in fresh-air intakes.
2:28:27
In this place I put in a fresh-air intake.
2:28:28
You’re
2:28:32
talking about your house here.
2:28:33
Mm-hmm, this place.
2:28:34
Tell me a little bit about this house and how it came to be.
2:28:39
Obviously, if you want to share some things about your family
2:28:42
life, too, that would be okay.
2:28:43
I don’t know if you want to.
2:28:44
Oh yeah, I don’t have a problem there.
2:28:46
It was kind of funny.
2:28:46
I want you to kind of go on that for a bit.
2:28:49
It started off we were living in a camp trailer right here,
2:28:52
right out front of the house.
2:28:54
You, Ginger, and what was your daughter’s name?
2:28:56
My daughter, Crystal.
2:28:57
Crystal, okay.
2:28:58
Yeah.
2:29:02
At that time there eventually was going to be a dwelling for maintenance.
2:29:08
They wanted that to happen just from a watchdog perspective.
2:29:16
So, there’d always be somebody here for whatever reasons, right?
2:29:21
Right.
2:29:21
Anyway, we were still in that ghetto in the meadow, house trailer mode.
2:29:27
But Art McKee had already talked to me about it phasing out these trailers.
2:29:34
We’ve already got the program started, and John Moreau should have known that,
2:29:41
that we were already starting down that road to eliminate all the trailers.
2:29:44
So, you’re talking about the pink trailer, are you getting to that story?
2:29:49
Yep, yep.
2:29:49
Go on, do that one for us!
2:29:50
This is the pink trailer!
2:29:51
This is?
2:29:52
Oh, now I remember.
2:29:53
Yeah, you’re sitting in it.
2:29:54
No, John told me, but no one give me your version.
2:29:57
The whole story.
2:29:58
Right.
2:29:58
That’s where we’re going.
2:29:59
Okay, now I gotcha.
2:30:01
A lot of memories mixed together.
2:30:02
So, this guy calls up from Siuslaw National Forest.
2:30:05
He’s got a trailer to get rid of and he wanted to offer it
2:30:08
to us, give us first dibs.
2:30:11
It’s a decent trailer.
2:30:12
It’s not leaking.
2:30:13
It’s old, but it’s not leaking.
2:30:17
It’s small and Art McKee was off on one of his world tours and so John made
2:30:26
the executive decision to go get it.
2:30:29
Okay, yeah, for free we’ll get it.
2:30:31
It was pink, right?
2:30:32
Was it really pink?
2:30:32
We’ll take it!
2:30:34
It’s actually the tag on the side of the trailer is still
2:30:39
over there underneath my work.
2:30:43
Right.
2:30:44
Was, yeah, Flamingo Manufacturing.
2:30:48
And it was pink
2:30:51
[laughs]
2:30:51
. [Laughs]
2:30:51
. Well, I mean it was the soft, that era, pastel pink.
2:30:57
Not hot pink.
2:30:58
No, it wasn’t hot pink.
2:30:59
It would have been pastel pink.
2:31:02
I should have kept a sample of the siding.
2:31:05
You’ve got pictures, don’t you?
2:31:07
No, I don’t.
2:31:09
Not of the pink trailer.
2:31:11
I wish that was around.
2:31:13
Well, it kind of turned into a hush-hush operation after
2:31:16
John dumped it in the field.
2:31:18
Anyway, he goes and gets it, brings it to the Andrews, and parks it in the field
2:31:23
down there by the volleyball court area.
2:31:28
This was in the mid to late ‘80s?
2:31:30
This would have been, I think
2:31:35
it was while we were working on Quartz Building, so it’d be ’90.
2:31:39
’90, okay.
2:31:40
’89, ’90, yeah.
2:31:43
Because we did the shop in ’88 and ’89.
2:31:47
’89 we broke ground on Quartz Building and while we were
2:31:52
building it the crew helped me
2:31:56
start remodel on the trailer.
2:31:58
Yeah, so it was ’89 the trailer showed up in ’89.
2:32:05
Art McKee comes back from his world tour
2:32:11
and
2:32:14
he came unglued when he saw that thing out in the field.
2:32:19
John didn’t communicate with anybody about it.
2:32:24
It’s just slapping him right in the face as soon as he gets back from his trip.
2:32:28
So, who caught the wrath first?
2:32:30
John did [laughs]
2:32:31
. Oh, really?
2:32:32
Oh yeah, did he ever [laughs] . It almost cost him his job.
2:32:38
Really?
2:32:38
But I got him settled down.
2:32:41
Look, Art, this may not be as bad as you think.
2:32:44
Think about this, what if we take that pink trailer back to the back
2:32:52
over there away from where your place is and we’ll set that pink
2:32:56
trailer up for the maintenance.
2:32:59
How about that?
2:33:01
Well, let me think about it.
2:33:04
You know how that goes.
2:33:05
He can’t make a snap decision.
2:33:08
A couple days later he says, yeah let’s go ahead and do that.
2:33:13
That’s probably a good thing to do.
2:33:17
So, we did.
2:33:18
We brought it back.
2:33:20
I cleared out an area right here for it to sit.
2:33:23
That would be that center portion is actually the trailer.
2:33:27
That’s what I’m thinking, yeah.
2:33:29
It’s 54’ long and 10’ wide.
2:33:31
This wall is from the trailer?
2:33:33
Mm-hmm.
2:33:34
The wall I’m looking at—
2:33:35
Part of it.
2:33:36
I framed it out deeper.
2:33:37
Right, right.
2:33:38
Because they’re only 2” by 3”, the trailer walls were only 3” thick,
2:33:45
3” wide [laughs] . Anyway, yeah, we set it up and moved in and then
2:33:54
my wife, daughter by another marriage, was going to have a baby
2:33:59
down in Arizona, down in Phoenix.
2:34:01
Her and my daughter were going to go down there and be with her to
2:34:06
help her deliver the baby and get going with the care and all that.
2:34:13
We might be gone a couple months, and I’m thinking mmmm... this would be a
2:34:18
perfect opportunity to make it decent.
2:34:21
Gussy it up, right?
2:34:22
Me and
2:34:25
the crew got started on it while we’re building the Quartz Building and started
2:34:32
enlarging it, remodeling it, fixing it up.
2:34:35
One of the funniest things is the crew just loved it.
2:34:39
We took the edges loose off of the old metal roof.
2:34:42
It was one of those old seamless metal roofs you know of a mobile
2:34:45
home and just rolled it up.
2:34:49
Look this is just like peeling open a can of sardines, I love it!
2:34:55
They thought that was the funniest thing.
2:34:57
We got all the way to the end and we had this gigantic roll of metal.
2:35:03
Now what are you going to do?
2:35:04
Like sheet metal, right?
2:35:06
Huh?
2:35:06
Thin, sheet metal?
2:35:07
Yep, thin sheet metal.
2:35:09
Galvanized.
2:35:09
It wasn’t even aluminum back then.
2:35:11
Right, right.
2:35:14
We got a cable and the backhoe over here and strapped it, grabbed on
2:35:21
to it with the backhoe, threw it in the dumpster with the other trash.
2:35:25
We had a big dumpster up here at the time and started framing the
2:35:29
new roof over to the add-on areas.
2:35:35
Like I said, at that time this was just a little screened in porch right here.
2:35:39
Where we’re sitting right now which is in the shape of a half hexagon, right?
2:35:44
Yeah.
2:35:44
Isn’t that it?
2:35:45
Right?
2:35:46
Octagon, actually.
2:35:47
Oh, octagon.
2:35:48
Oh, okay.
2:35:49
Well, it’s five-sided.
2:35:50
What’s it called a five-sided bay.
2:35:52
I got a great idea—you told me that they’re thinking about turning
2:35:54
this into a physical center.
2:35:57
You could have extreme fighting octagon scientists here [laughs]
2:36:02
. [Laughs] There you go.
2:36:03
That’s a joke, for the record.
2:36:05
That’s not a serious question.
2:36:06
Anyway,
2:36:08
so your wife’s gone.
2:36:12
How far did you get by the time she got back?
2:36:15
They came back early.
2:36:19
I was to the sheet rock stage when they got back, and I should’ve
2:36:24
never done it in the first place.
2:36:28
I thought it was going to be a sweet surprise.
2:36:31
She thought it was totally disgusting because she was
2:36:34
left out of the whole process.
2:36:36
Oh, she was ready to kill me.
2:36:39
You didn’t have no design input and all that.
2:36:41
That’s right.
2:36:43
So, I said, settle down.
2:36:46
Okay, I’ll let you choose the kitchen cabinets and the carpet and
2:36:52
what kind of flooring do you want.
2:36:55
Well, okay, I can at least do that.
2:36:59
She chose all the carpet.
2:37:02
There used to be a lot more carpet in there than there is
2:37:04
now because she loved carpet.
2:37:07
But this is not country for carpet.
2:37:11
This is no-no country for carpet.
2:37:12
Well, you ain’t going to keep it clean.
2:37:14
No.
2:37:15
I cleaned carpets in Arizona for two years.
2:37:20
This would not stay clean at all.
2:37:24
Especially back in the—well, shag carpeting.
2:37:27
Now it’s, this is the all-weather stuff you got in here.
2:37:31
The indoor-outdoor stuff in this room that we’re talking in right now.
2:37:37
That’s the story of the pink trailer.
2:37:39
We managed to make it work out just fine after John Moreau got scalped
2:37:47
[laughs] . Poor John I felt sorry for him.
2:37:50
But yeah Art threatened to fire him.
2:37:53
He was so upset at first.
2:37:56
It took him a couple of days to settle down.
2:38:00
But he got it for free, right?
2:38:02
Yeah, it didn’t cost nothing but gas to go get it and bring
2:38:04
it up here just on the fly.
2:38:08
He used a pickup truck to haul it in.
2:38:10
Oh, so that was a Forest Service vehicle without permission, right?
2:38:14
Well, no, I mean it was assigned to us.
2:38:17
That wasn’t a problem.
2:38:20
It was just a little underrated for a 10’x54’ house trailer.
2:38:26
Just little.
2:38:28
You mean how solid it was.
2:38:28
The weight.
2:38:30
The truck that you were bringing it up.
2:38:32
The weight restriction, yeah.
2:38:34
But it handled it just fine.
2:38:35
He didn’t have a bit of trouble.
2:38:37
He had a permit to pull it on the freeway.
2:38:41
That wasn’t a problem.
2:38:44
We often forgot back in those early eras, we’re state workers and
2:38:49
we’re using federal vehicles and we’re not used to their protocol
2:38:54
and their way of doing business.
2:38:54
There
2:38:58
was a lot of times when we were outlaws without even knowing it,
2:39:02
when we weren’t even aware that we were bruising somebody’s toes.
2:39:09
From what I’ve heard there have been issues over time about people using
2:39:14
Forest Service trucks improperly or after work, even though it was innocent.
2:39:20
Things like that.
2:39:23
Were you here for the skinny-dipping controversy?
2:39:27
Were you?
2:39:30
Yeah [laughs] . Oh man.
2:39:31
Good grief.
2:39:32
Well, I wasn’t here for the early era of it.
2:39:34
Well, there was an early one and there was a later one.
2:39:36
Two of them.
2:39:36
That’s right.
2:39:38
I wasn’t here for the first one.
2:39:40
Al Levno used to tell me about it.
2:39:43
And Art.
2:39:44
Art had a few stories.
2:39:46
But there was a recent one, too, right?
2:39:48
More recent one?
2:39:50
Yeah.
2:39:50
What did that involve?
2:39:52
It was just kids skinny dipping.
2:39:54
You mean the workers up here?
2:39:55
And they didn’t know that it was a no-no.
2:40:00
There was a little bit of hand slapping, that’s all.
2:40:10
Anyway, now tell me a little about, more about your life in this house.
2:40:16
Tell me a little bit more about the finishing of the house, your life
2:40:18
up here with Ginger and Crystal.
2:40:21
You had a dog at the time, right?
2:40:23
A German shepherd.
2:40:23
For a while, yeah.
2:40:25
Tell me about your life and what it was like to live up here as a
2:40:28
family within this unique community.
2:40:30
It was a, yeah, that would be a good way to put it.
2:40:33
It was a very unique situation for us.
2:40:36
My wife had already started home schooling our daughter.
2:40:43
Because the nearest school would have been McKenzie Bridge, right?
2:40:45
Yeah.
2:40:47
Okay.
2:40:48
That wasn’t really a problem.
2:40:49
We’re a little isolated from
2:40:53
the rest of civilization.
2:40:55
Humanity.
2:40:57
Right.
2:40:58
But it wasn’t too bad.
2:41:00
We kept her connected with other children her age, too.
2:41:04
We felt it was important to do that.
2:41:07
She’d always been a good girl and she had
2:41:12
a lot of good friends.
2:41:14
That was never a problem.
2:41:17
The real challenge was facing the School Board because we started doing
2:41:23
that in the era when the public-school systems were trying to shut it down.
2:41:29
Home schooling?
2:41:29
Yeah, they were trying to stop home schooling.
2:41:34
But then it became more and more apparent that there was no way that
2:41:39
they could really honestly fight that,
2:41:45
especially if you went to a lawyer and that’s what we did.
2:41:50
We got into a lawyer system that helps to explain to you your
2:41:57
rights, what you can do and what you can’t do, and they protect you.
2:42:02
It was almost like a club or something.
2:42:05
Anyway, the bottom line was all we had to do is have her tested once
2:42:10
a year at the school, at the public school and as long as she could
2:42:16
do the test it’s not a problem.
2:42:18
It never was.
2:42:21
They throw out those scare tactics.
2:42:22
That’s what they try to do first.
2:42:26
Finally, we put our foot down and said no, this is going to happen.
2:42:29
This
2:42:31
is the way it’s going to go and when we’re ready to have her tested we’ll be here.
2:42:37
They never fought us again.
2:42:39
I think the concern is that to making sure whomever is doing
2:42:43
the teaching is giving that child
2:42:48
adequate skills.
2:42:49
Quality, that’s right.
2:42:49
At least in the basics,
2:42:53
you know?
2:42:54
Of course, the whole American experiment is based in many ways
2:43:00
in the public education system.
2:43:01
Thomas Jefferson says that’s the bedrock of democracy going forward is education
2:43:07
and the public education system.
2:43:09
That’s in our DNA.
2:43:10
Yeah.
2:43:11
It’s really hard to break that.
2:43:12
Of course, infrastructure, bureaucracy always overreaches itself
2:43:16
and tries to control everything.
2:43:18
A little bit, yeah.
2:43:19
I know what you’re talking about, yeah.
2:43:21
But they ended up cooperating, you know?
2:43:23
It was a scary challenge at first.
2:43:25
They ended up cooperating.
2:43:26
This would have been back in the ‘90s?
2:43:29
It started off in ’78.
2:43:33
Oh, immediately.
2:43:33
When you were in Vida.
2:43:35
Yeah, she was born in ’76 and ’78 was when my wife decided we
2:43:42
were going to home school her.
2:43:44
I said okay as long as you can handle it.
2:43:47
You were unhappy with the school system up here, or just—?
2:43:50
Not at all.
2:43:54
My wife felt that the Lord has His hand on her and that she should have—
2:44:01
A say.
2:44:01
A very special education.
2:44:03
And boy she got it.
2:44:08
My wife didn’t cut no corners.
2:44:10
Ginger put her through the course.
2:44:14
But she’s a good girl, a good smart girl.
2:44:16
She handled it quite well.
2:44:20
When we moved here to the Andrews, I’m going to say she
2:44:26
was 11 years old, 12 years old.
2:44:30
My concern was that we were too much the gypsies and our daughter needed
2:44:39
some roots, some stability for a while.
2:44:43
Even in terms of her education, I wanted to see that take place
2:44:47
in a more stable atmosphere.
2:44:49
The rest of her education.
2:44:52
That was part of the reason I made the decision with Art to
2:44:55
go ahead and yeah, I’ll stay.
2:44:58
If you’re going to open up a permanent position, then yeah, I’ll stay.
2:45:02
Well, my wife, she didn’t like that.
2:45:05
So, she didn’t like the idea of coming up here at first?
2:45:09
She was okay with it, just on a temporary—you know, that gypsy blood.
2:45:14
We’d come up and hang out for a few months and then go.
2:45:17
That was fine.
2:45:19
But permanent, oh man the stuff hit the fan.
2:45:25
She threatened divorce for four years and finally one day I said you know, you might
2:45:31
as well quit talking that because you’re mine and I’m not going to let you go.
2:45:40
The husband has the right at least at that time.
2:45:45
I think it’s changed since then.
2:45:46
Yeah, I think it has, too.
2:45:48
She never fought me.
2:45:49
I said, you can fight me but I’m not going to give you a yes.
2:45:51
If you want a divorce, if you want to separate, then I’m willing to
2:45:51
let you do that but I’m not going
2:46:01
to give you a divorce.
2:46:02
Did she come to accept this eventually?
2:46:04
Nope, never did.
2:46:07
She never did.
2:46:08
Never got over it.
2:46:10
Poor girl.
2:46:10
So, eventually did she end up living somewhere else, Terry?
2:46:13
No, she tried it one year and was gone for about 6 months and called me up one
2:46:20
day and said I’m going to come back.
2:46:21
I said, sure.
2:46:23
Come on back.
2:46:24
This is your place.
2:46:27
She came back, but still she never got over it.
2:46:31
She got dementia when she got—I think part of it was connected with her cancer.
2:46:39
It
2:46:44
was a real rare form, and I can’t remember the name of it now.
2:46:48
It got into her colon and they took the colon out and through that surgical
2:46:56
process and the drugs, the dementia that she did have she went over the edge.
2:47:03
She just really lost it after the surgery.
2:47:06
Did she have to be in a care facility or something?
2:47:09
Yeah.
2:47:09
I’m sorry about that, Terry.
2:47:11
I know.
2:47:13
That was a living nightmare.
2:47:15
Was it close enough to here where you were able to—?
2:47:18
Yeah, Springfield.
2:47:19
Oh, in Springfield, okay.
2:47:22
But I still couldn’t visit as often as I wanted to because she
2:47:27
was always trying to make me feel guilty and get her out of there.
2:47:32
There was just no way that was going to happen, and it was tearing me apart.
2:47:35
Well, you couldn’t take care of her up here.
2:47:37
No, no.
2:47:38
Besides, I mean, and I’m not saying people up here aren’t understanding, but this
2:47:44
is not the kind of place that you could have a dementia patient wandering around.
2:47:48
That’s right.
2:47:49
They could get hurt.
2:47:50
That’s right, or hurt others, or cause someone to get hurt.
2:47:53
It could freak out people that don’t know the situation.
2:47:57
People are understanding, but, you know.
2:47:58
But, yeah.
2:48:00
Yeah,
2:48:03
it was rough, but it was for the best.
2:48:06
Greg Downing was a big help through all of that.
2:48:10
He got her, Ginger and him got to be really good friends.
2:48:15
That’s really nice.
2:48:15
Towards the end there.
2:48:16
He’s a really cool guy.
2:48:17
Yes, he is.
2:48:18
I like Greg.
2:48:18
He’s a very good man, good heart.
2:48:22
They got to be really good friends and he and I both question now whether we should
2:48:26
have went with the surgery or not, because he’s the one that ended up convincing
2:48:32
her to go in for the final testing.
2:48:35
The colon thing, you’re talking about?
2:48:37
Yeah and having the colon cancer removed.
2:48:40
Well, after the surgery when she was in the facility 8 months later
2:48:50
it came back and broke into her uterus.
2:48:54
That’s when the surgeon came out and said there’s nothing we can do.
2:49:01
We sewed her back up and that’s it.
2:49:07
She might have a year or 6 months.
2:49:10
It was 3 months later she was gone.
2:49:14
It ate her up that quick.
2:49:18
Which was kind of a blessing, you know, because the dementia had—she was
2:49:25
at the point where she was wandering around the home naked as a jaybird,
2:49:32
and she was the most modest woman you would have ever met, and then she
2:49:36
just totally flipped the other way.
2:49:40
It does strange things to people.
2:49:42
Yes, it does.
2:49:43
I told you outside I came back home to Oregon from Arizona to care for
2:49:47
my mother who had dementia, Alzheimer and it was quite an adventure and
2:49:57
I lived with her the whole time.
2:49:59
It was different man-wife, son-mother, but still it’s hard.
2:50:10
We kept her in the family home, but she didn’t have the severity
2:50:14
that you’re talking about, at least it would have got there.
2:50:17
Then there wasn’t the other cancer thing.
2:50:20
A heart attack took my mother before the dementia got completely gone.
2:50:24
It was pretty bad, but yeah it was—yeah, the best analogy I’ve heard
2:50:30
was it’s like you have a house where all the lights are on and then all
2:50:35
of a sudden for whatever reasons this turns off and then this turns off.
2:50:40
In other words, the compartments of cognition in the mind start to shut down.
2:50:44
And sometimes then they turn back on, so you think oh they’re okay.
2:50:48
Exactly.
2:50:48
It goes like that and—
2:50:50
That was the torture for me was seeing that back and forth.
2:50:56
Wow.
2:50:59
There were so many things I’ve built in here hoping that,
2:51:03
thinking that she would come back.
2:51:07
I didn’t give up for a long time.
2:51:08
You’re talking about paintings or you’re talking about cupboards?
2:51:11
Cupboards, cabinets.
2:51:15
I made a little sign board, backsplash board behind the range, kind of a
2:51:23
vintage thing with her name on it.
2:51:26
I was doing all kinds of little things like that.
2:51:28
They helped keep me busy and they helped to keep my hope alive, too.
2:51:32
And keep you sane, too.
2:51:33
Yep, sanity.
2:51:35
Right, right.
2:51:36
I assume that you put a couple paintings in her room down in
2:51:40
Springfield, though, right.
2:51:41
Did you?
2:51:42
Yeah, yeah.
2:51:44
Took some furniture down to her, her favorite DVDs, a few things like that.
2:51:50
It didn’t last long.
2:51:51
It’s a strange atmosphere down there.
2:51:55
Anyway, things disappeared.
2:51:57
But things were disappearing here before she left when she
2:52:03
had dementia before the cancer.
2:52:07
I don’t know what happened, especially her DVDs.
2:52:13
They were always disappearing, completely.
2:52:15
I don’t know if they ended up in the trash or what, but they just disappeared.
2:52:20
It’s hard to explain stuff.
2:52:23
Because every story like this has similarities but they’re also different.
2:52:28
Unique, right?
2:52:29
Because the person’s unique, each person.
2:52:32
And the mind is such a complicated thing.
2:52:35
I know it.
2:52:37
And we don’t know so many things.
2:52:40
But your family and your wife and Crystal are all over this place.
2:52:44
This is their personality?
2:52:45
Yeah.
2:52:46
So, where’s Crystal now?
2:52:49
She, let’s go back to her story.
2:52:53
Yeah, let’s finish that, yeah.
2:52:54
Home schooling—she finished school and went to work at Harbick’s [Country]
2:52:57
Store, which is now Blue Sky Market for a couple of years, about 4 years, actually.
2:53:06
We gave her the choice you want to go to college or you want to do something else?
2:53:12
Some kind of education.
2:53:13
This is your call and we’ll support you.
2:53:16
Right.
2:53:17
She thought about it a long time.
2:53:19
A couple of friends of hers counseled her.
2:53:24
One particular friend was already in what they called a YWAM program,
2:53:29
which was Youth With A Mission.
2:53:32
They’re international.
2:53:33
They’re all over the world and it’s where kids learn to interact with street kids,
2:53:39
other kids, poor kids, and help them to get on the right track, get away from the
2:53:48
gangs and the drugs and all that stuff.
2:53:53
Anyway, she decided to join YWAM and this was 20 years ago, something like that.
2:54:01
She still doing that?
2:54:03
She started off with YWAM International and went to England, Spain, France,
2:54:09
Germany—mostly to European countries.
2:54:14
Spent time doing missionary work.
2:54:18
She finally settled in Scotland.
2:54:19
Fell in love with Scotland and decided to start the process of
2:54:24
nationalizing herself as a Scot.
2:54:28
She got nationalized as a Scot and then
2:54:34
Scotland, the Church of Edinburgh wanted her
2:54:40
take on the task, they were ready to turn it over, the head of the, it’s
2:54:48
called the 24/7 Prayer Scotland.
2:54:53
They were ready to turn the principal position over to her.
2:55:00
The other guy was retiring, and they wanted her to take it on.
2:55:04
Right.
2:55:04
Because she’s that strong of a spiritual girl.
2:55:09
So, she did.
2:55:10
She took that on 2 years ago and that’s where she’s at now.
2:55:13
She’s the head coach for the International Prayer Teams.
2:55:20
Is she married?
2:55:21
She’s single.
2:55:22
She got close one time but decided boy was a little too immature.
2:55:27
That happens.
2:55:28
Yeah, we tend to be immature until we’re not
2:55:37
[laughs]
2:55:37
. Guys are like that, you know [laughs] . Anyway, we’re still
2:55:38
hoping she’ll get a husband.
2:55:40
She says she’s not opposed to it, but she’s not in a hurry.
2:55:44
She’s 42 now.
2:55:46
Sounds like she’s got a good mission in life.
2:55:48
Yes, she does.
2:55:50
She’s very focused and very determined.
2:55:54
Yeah, and I’m very proud of her.
2:55:56
She did good with her education that her mother gave her.
2:56:00
She did real good.
2:56:03
She really knows how to relate to kids.
2:56:07
She knows how to live out of a suitcase because she did that
2:56:10
with us for several years.
2:56:11
That’s very ironic she grew up a lot of the time out here far from most kids.
2:56:18
Maybe that’s part of the attraction.
2:56:19
Yeah, that could be, yeah.
2:56:21
She just has a very strong heart for the street kids.
2:56:30
Tell me a little about John Moreau.
2:56:33
He was another guy who was here even longer than you.
2:56:37
Oh yeah.
2:56:37
But you guys parallel really each other and because of what he did and what
2:56:42
you did, you worked together a lot.
2:56:44
Just talk to me about John.
2:56:46
Yes, we did.
2:56:46
Just talk to me about John, his role here, and your relationship with John
2:56:50
and some stories and anecdotes, funny and otherwise, about you and John.
2:56:54
Kind of like brothers.
2:56:55
We fought a lot.
2:56:57
We were always working together, around each other, all the time.
2:57:04
We’d get in a tizzy now and then [laughs] . He
2:57:08
was a good counselor.
2:57:09
He was a very good counselor for me, taught me a lot of
2:57:12
things: how to do business.
2:57:18
Before I came along John was the Site Manager, he was the Field Technician,
2:57:26
he was Maintenance.
2:57:28
He was everything before Don Eilee showed up John was here taking
2:57:32
care of—I mean yeah it was more primitive then, but that was his role.
2:57:37
When Art McKee showed up as Site Director, he was Site Manager
2:57:42
and Maintenance and Field Tech.
2:57:47
But of course, that became more and more obvious that he wouldn’t
2:57:50
be able to fill all those roles.
2:57:52
As we grew, then his job became more and more focused on just being a Field Tech.
2:58:01
Basically, monitoring all the equipment out there.
2:58:04
Yeah, which is a full-time job in itself.
2:58:07
But repairing it as he could but you often were probably the
2:58:10
more skilled mechanic, right?
2:58:14
Mm-hmm.
2:58:15
Much more so than John.
2:58:16
John wasn’t exactly—well, he wasn’t polished, let me put it that way.
2:58:20
He didn’t know a lot about construction techniques and so he would come
2:58:27
to me for advice on how to make something work and make it last
2:58:33
longer and different things like that.
2:58:37
I was involved in helping him construct it and placement, going out to the
2:58:44
field and helping him get things set up.
2:58:48
Over the years we’ve worked together on all of his field stations:
2:58:56
getting them set up and functional.
2:58:58
Some of them we had to haul all the material in with a quad.
2:59:04
There’s trail access only.
2:59:07
That was actually kind of fun.
2:59:10
Vanilla Met was one of those, right?
2:59:11
[Vanilla Leaf meteorological station]
2:59:11
Yeah, Vanilla Met.
2:59:12
Yep.
2:59:14
Used a quad to carry in sack after sack after sack of
2:59:17
concrete for the foundations.
2:59:19
Foundations.
2:59:20
Stem walls.
2:59:21
And
2:59:23
an 8’x10’ building don’t sound like much, but when it sits on a stem wall that’s
2:59:28
3’ high because of the slope that it sits
2:59:36
on [laughs] , that’s a lot of concrete, boy.
2:59:37
Now Central Met you had road access, right?
2:59:40
Yep.
2:59:40
Yeah.
2:59:41
UpLo [Upper Lookout] and Central were a road access.
2:59:45
But Vanilla was the quads.
2:59:47
Yep.
2:59:47
That was all quad work up there.
2:59:49
Boy what a job.
2:59:50
When we were in the field doing the interview, he talked a lot
2:59:53
about you and him working and doing the building and figuring out
2:59:58
what worked and what didn’t work.
2:59:59
Sometimes the first construction model—and protecting the orifices and
3:00:05
making sure this didn’t collapse and all
3:00:09
that.
3:00:09
Oh, man, I know it.
3:00:09
It was a challenge.
3:00:10
It was fun, though.
3:00:11
Yeah?
3:00:12
Because he is the one that would do the research on what we needed to use to
3:00:18
make those things work and I was the mechanic who knew how to take those
3:00:23
things and put them all together.
3:00:26
And make them functional?
3:00:27
Yeah and make them functional.
3:00:28
Yep.
3:00:31
Yeah those were good days.
3:00:33
They were great days.
3:00:35
We were outlaws a lot of times and that was part of the job.
3:00:40
Right.
3:00:41
I mean just outlaws in ignorance.
3:00:43
Outlaws of ignorance—that’s a great name for a song or a movie
3:00:45
[laughs] . Outlaws of ignorance.
3:00:46
[Laughs] I know it.
3:00:46
Right.
3:00:46
There was so
3:00:55
much protocol back in those early days that we just didn’t know.
3:00:58
We didn’t.
3:01:00
In fact, it finally reached a point where the staff says, okay, that’s enough.
3:01:08
We are tired of being outlaws without knowing it.
3:01:14
We want the Forest Service to start feeding us with the information
3:01:20
we need to do this stuff.
3:01:22
Before the fact so you didn’t have to go and fix a bunch of stuff or
3:01:27
rebuild or redo or mix something.
3:01:29
And my butt was getting sore from being slapped so many times
3:01:36
[laughs] . And they complied!
3:01:37
They did.
3:01:38
They helped a lot.
3:01:41
Those mid-construction era days, mid-90s, I’m going to say early to mid-90s
3:01:47
they started helping us with training: free programs, free training programs.
3:01:53
What were the kind of things that you learned that you weren’t supposed
3:01:55
to do that you then learned how to do the way it was supposed to be.
3:01:59
Give me a for example.
3:02:03
I think one of the most critical ones for me is communicate.
3:02:09
Communicate what you’re going to do before you do it.
3:02:14
Make sure you’re clear with your communication so
3:02:19
that everybody feels like they’re all on the same page.
3:02:24
So many times, I learned that the hard way, you know.
3:02:29
Training—how to take care of a vehicle, being more conscientious
3:02:36
and aware of what you’re doing with the equipment you’re using.
3:02:43
There are training manuals for that kind of thing.
3:02:47
Those have been really important for us.
3:02:53
When I’m drawing plans for the building, like the engineers taught me, you
3:02:59
need to draw, yeah, I was never big on intense drafts, drawing up blueprints.
3:03:10
Try to keep it simple.
3:03:12
And the engineers said, yah, you want to keep it simple, but you need
3:03:16
to be precise and you have to treat contractors like first graders.
3:03:22
That’s what the engineers told me [laughs] , that way there’s
3:03:26
no failure of communication.
3:03:30
They can look at that picture and they can see, they can’t get
3:03:34
around what that picture says.
3:03:36
That’s the point they’re making.
3:03:39
You treat them like they’re first graders.
3:03:41
Simple but concise.
3:03:46
Yeah, just a lot of things like that we learned over the years not to
3:03:54
get our hands slapped so many times.
3:03:57
It still happens but not like it used to, you know.
3:04:00
There’s no way around it.
3:04:02
You’re bound to either break or bend one sooner or later.
3:04:09
Tell me about any rescue stories or epic snow adventures or, I mean, John told
3:04:16
me about some of those, but I know you were probably involved in some of those.
3:04:20
Tell me about a particular—
3:04:22
That’s a learning curve too.
3:04:23
Tell me about that.
3:04:25
Going out on the snow—we had a buddy system going early on.
3:04:31
Before you had walkie-talkies, right?
3:04:33
Oh yeah.
3:04:33
Did you always have walkie-talkies?
3:04:35
No—if we did, I didn’t know it.
3:04:39
Okay, but a buddy system in place is my point.
3:04:41
Yeah, we had the buddy system going so [for the] maintenance department one
3:04:48
of their responsibilities in the winter time was to go out with a researcher,
3:04:52
if he needed a buddy to go out with him.
3:04:56
That was one of the first things I learned on the snowmobile is if the
3:05:01
snowmobile starts to go sideways a little bit don’t throw your leg
3:05:04
out to try and stabilize yourself.
3:05:07
Or you’re going to break your leg, right?
3:05:08
No, you’re going to get ripped off the snowmobile and the snowmobile’s
3:05:13
going to take off right into the creek.
3:05:13
Okay.
3:05:16
That’s what I found out [laughs]
3:05:18
. Did you do that?
3:05:20
It didn’t reach the creek, but yeah.
3:05:22
Oh yeah, it jerked me right off of there.
3:05:26
Man, that was an eye-opener.
3:05:28
Were you okay?
3:05:28
My thigh muscle, that’s all it did, is it bruised the thigh muscle.
3:05:32
Oh, okay.
3:05:34
I was sore for a week, man.
3:05:36
It was just [smacking sound] and I was gone.
3:05:40
Just one little touch.
3:05:42
Well, the best lessons learned are painful lessons.
3:05:45
I guess so.
3:05:46
You never forget it.
3:05:47
No.
3:05:49
Yeah, and there’s been lots of times where we had to dig guys out of the snow.
3:05:55
Snowmobiles getting buried, just too deep for one guy to dig out, you know.
3:06:01
We never had any serious accidents.
3:06:03
No bone-breakers.
3:06:05
It’s amazing nobody every died in the Andrews, historically.
3:06:07
I know.
3:06:07
Because there are all the people, all the science, the topography’s pretty dramatic.
3:06:14
There’s some places where you could get hurt.
3:06:16
Oh, absolutely.
3:06:18
It’s not like we’re on the edge of the North Sister or something,
3:06:21
but it’s still there’s a lot of hazardous areas up high, especially.
3:06:24
Yep, it can happen.
3:06:28
Yeah, no deaths thank goodness.
3:06:31
Because
3:06:33
I mean it’s basically a dangerous environment.
3:06:37
You have to look at it that way.
3:06:39
This place can kill you, and you need to respect it for that.
3:06:43
I think there’s only been a couple broken legs.
3:06:46
Yeah, only a couple.
3:06:47
The sheriff?
3:06:48
One recent one, yeah, Sheriff for one.
3:06:50
You were here for that, right?
3:06:51
Yeah, but man isn’t that bizarre.
3:06:55
I mean he wasn’t even—
3:06:55
I mean he was out with basically a crew of inmates doing trail worker or helping
3:07:02
pairing the batteries up, I think.
3:07:04
Yep.
3:07:05
For Barbara Bond’s system.
3:07:08
Yep.
3:07:08
Yeah, and then of course the sheriff breaks his leg [laughs]
3:07:11
. [Laughs] I know.
3:07:12
That was hilarious.
3:07:13
Go figure, right?
3:07:14
And I guess some student, or somebody broke their leg out somewhere,
3:07:20
an ankle or something once.
3:07:21
Yep.
3:07:21
I think that’s—but that’s the most severe that I’ve ever heard.
3:07:25
Yeah.
3:07:26
Which I think is a great safety record, really.
3:07:30
Yeah, I know it.
3:07:31
And I think that’s because our people have always respected the
3:07:37
danger of the environment here.
3:07:40
They know that it can be very dangerous, especially for a person that’s out
3:07:45
alone that it could result in a death.
3:07:49
It really could.
3:07:50
We’ve always respected that.
3:07:53
I’ve always admired our people for that.
3:07:57
They’re always trying to improve our technique, you know.
3:08:03
There was always room for improvement, like our radio system.
3:08:07
We’re always trying to get that working better,
3:08:13
more areas get better coverage and that kind of thing, better awareness, you know.
3:08:21
Our safety days so that the kids understand that being aware of the danger
3:08:28
and how to take care of yourself in that danger is critical, very critical.
3:08:34
I think continuity here is one of the reasons why the Andrews
3:08:38
has been such a strong site.
3:08:40
Yeah.
3:08:41
Administratively and scientifically.
3:08:43
I think it’s reflected in what you’re talking about.
3:08:48
Continuity and you also have a lot of integrity, a lot of people who
3:08:51
are serious, they’re smart people, but they’re also good people.
3:08:56
You’ve had a continuity and a commitment to making this
3:09:00
successful and safe and enjoyable.
3:09:04
Yeah.
3:09:05
That’s hard to do.
3:09:06
That’s a hard balance to achieve.
3:09:08
For the most part it works well.
3:09:15
I’m going to give you, this is a two-ended question.
3:09:20
You’re going to be able to answer it coming and going, so to speak.
3:09:25
What was the big culture shock when you first came to Oregon from the south?
3:09:32
In reverse, how have you become acclimated to a completely different culture,
3:09:37
but also environment, and how do you think it’s going to be going back.
3:09:42
Kind of do a 2-part question there: tell me about the first culture shock
3:09:46
and learning curve and now having soaked in this for 35 years, how do
3:09:51
you think it’s going to be going back?
3:09:53
That’ll
3:09:55
be easy.
3:09:57
I could tell you for a fact, me and my wife’s first impression of Oregon in 1971:
3:10:05
where are the bugs?
3:10:08
There’s no bugs in Oregon!
3:10:11
I can’t believe it.
3:10:12
This is heaven!
3:10:13
[Laughs] That’s what we’re thinking, there’s no bugs in Oregon!
3:10:20
I was shocked.
3:10:22
There’s no mosquitos.
3:10:24
There’s no no-see-ums.
3:10:27
There’s no—in Louisiana, every time you stop for gas you have
3:10:34
to wash your windshield because it’s so splattered with bugs—
3:10:39
You can’t see.
3:10:39
That’s a constant job.
3:10:41
You have to keep that windshield cleaned up.
3:10:45
I washed my windshield in Oregon maybe once a week
3:10:51
[laughs] . If even that much, that often.
3:10:55
That was amazing.
3:10:56
Yeah.
3:10:57
No snakes.
3:10:59
No bugs.
3:10:59
No alligators.
3:11:01
I just can’t believe there’s actually country like this.
3:11:05
It’s paradise.
3:11:08
But then we had to experience our first winter: rain, rain, rain,
3:11:12
rain, rain, rain, rain, rain.
3:11:15
Let’s get out of here.
3:11:16
We’re going back to Houston.
3:11:20
Yeah, it was culture shock weather-wise and the environment wise.
3:11:27
The people were a little more—we had a little trouble adjusting to that
3:11:33
difference because down south people are in your face friendly, right now.
3:11:43
How you doing, man?
3:11:44
Let’s get a cup of coffee.
3:11:46
They don’t even: who are you?
3:11:49
Well, that’s Oregonians say: who are you?
3:11:53
Get away from me.
3:11:55
I need my space.
3:11:56
It takes a while to get to know Oregonians, and
3:11:59
that’s the only difference.
3:12:00
It takes a little longer.
3:12:04
Interesting.
3:12:06
How do you think it’s going to be going back?
3:12:08
Oh, boy.
3:12:11
Now what I’ve already been practicing.
3:12:15
One of the first things I’ve noticed going back is the humidity.
3:12:20
I don’t remember it being that bad when I was a kid down there.
3:12:23
Well, because you were acclimated to it.
3:12:26
That’s right [laughs]
3:12:27
. I’ll never forget my first lesson in really intense heat
3:12:32
and humidity was in 1984.
3:12:35
My father and I went on a cross-country trip for 5 weeks.
3:12:40
He picked me up in Flagstaff, Arizona.
3:12:42
I was living in Phoenix.
3:12:44
We drove all the way across the country to visit my sister in Georgia.
3:12:48
She was teaching and then we went up to Chicago and to the Midwest and then
3:12:53
went through all the national parks of the Rocky Mountains and back to Oregon.
3:12:56
It was a wonderful experience.
3:12:58
But I’ll never forget this.
3:13:00
Number one, two funny things for the record here, and I was going
3:13:04
to mention it to you when you were talking to your sister earlier:
3:13:07
the worst smell of my life were the stockyards outside of Amarillo, Texas.
3:13:14
I was sleeping.
3:13:17
It’s the biggest in the world, or it was.
3:13:20
I was sleeping and all of a sudden, my eyes started to burn.
3:13:24
I felt like—and it was this light and fire over it, it was the biggest stockyard
3:13:29
in the world—the wind was blowing.
3:13:31
It was the worst thing I’ve ever smelled, okay.
3:13:34
Anyway, it was another day and a half later we stayed in Memphis.
3:13:39
In 1984 it’s still the worst heat wave in the history of the south.
3:13:44
1984. Many people died.
3:13:49
We went to Memphis, Tennessee.
3:13:50
We were staying right on the Mississippi River and that day it was 104o
3:13:56
with 95% humidity, which is almost meteorologically the highest combination
3:14:00
you can get of those two factors.
3:14:03
It was the hottest, most horrible heat I’ve ever felt.
3:14:06
It seemed way more abnormal than the normal combination, another
3:14:09
5, 10 degrees and 5% humidity.
3:14:14
It was so bad I didn’t even go outside.
3:14:16
It was like a hot blanket hitting me in the face.
3:14:19
As we’re driving over the—
3:14:22
A hot, wet blanket.
3:14:23
And we didn’t have time to go to Graceland because we had to get over
3:14:27
across to Mississippi and Alabama to get to my sister, and I remember
3:14:32
my comment to my father was, I said: no wonder Elvis did drugs [laughs]
3:14:40
. [Laughs]
3:14:41
. Because it was so insufferably hot.
3:14:44
If you read back in the internet look up 1984 heat wave south
3:14:48
and it will tell you about that.
3:14:49
It was a deadly heat wave.
3:14:51
We hit it right in the—actually, at the end of the heat wave, because
3:14:54
by the time we got to Georgia it was starting to taper off.
3:14:57
Oh, right.
3:14:59
Anyway, so I’m just telling you that was my first experience.
3:15:02
My second was hiking in the Amazon jungle with my wife, my wife from Peru.
3:15:07
Having taught history, exploration history, of people
3:15:11
trying to cross the Amazon.
3:15:13
I learned during the first hike we did in the Amazon why those explorers always
3:15:19
died [laughs] . Because that degree of humidity is really difficult to survive,
3:15:26
and especially when you’re out there, because you sweat out so much water.
3:15:31
I’m just giving you a little something to look forward to again [laughs]
3:15:37
. Right, thanks.
3:15:38
Yeah, exactly.
3:15:40
Yeah, I don’t remember all that when I was a kid.
3:15:43
It didn’t seem near that bad.
3:15:46
It doesn’t though, you know?
3:15:48
It doesn’t seem the same.
3:15:50
Even in Phoenix when I went down the first year it was horrible.
3:15:53
I suffered horribly.
3:15:54
Then I got acclimated to it.
3:15:56
Then when I got older and smart I started to hate the heat again, but it
3:16:00
was a different kind of heat except for that monsoon thing in the middle where
3:16:03
you got 4 to 6-8 weeks of humidity.
3:16:06
But it’s not the kind of humidity you get down there in Louisiana and Texas.
3:16:11
That’s hot.
3:16:12
I know.
3:16:12
It’s almost like a boiling heat, humidity.
3:16:18
Boiling steam.
3:16:20
The one thing is you don’t get cold winters down there.
3:16:24
Well, we do.
3:16:26
But they’re short-lived.
3:16:28
That’s the difference.
3:16:29
They only last for a month or two.
3:16:32
But oh yeah, they get their ice storms.
3:16:34
I’ve seen
3:16:37
snow on Holly Beach, right on the gulf.
3:16:41
It’s just not there very long.
3:16:44
Four inches.
3:16:45
The record in Sulphur is 4” for 3 days?
3:16:49
I think it was 3 days they had 4” of snow in South Louisiana.
3:16:54
Of course, you get hurricanes, too.
3:16:55
That was years and years ago.
3:16:57
Yeah, that’s what we get a lot of.
3:16:59
Were you in Sulphur when Hurricane Betty hit?
3:17:02
That’s that really horrible one in ’65?
3:17:06
Yeah.
3:17:09
The worst one that hit Sulphur was Hurricane Audrey and they
3:17:15
lost—and that was, that would have been maybe the late ‘50s.
3:17:22
It’d
3:17:26
have to be from mid to late ‘50s because I was just a young, young boy then.
3:17:34
A lot of people died in that one mostly because the people were warned, but
3:17:41
ignored the warning and chose not to leave and they should have because that
3:17:48
was the year, that was the hurricane that brought in the 500’ tidal wave?
3:17:54
It was something like 400 people, killed 400 people.
3:17:59
Of course, the worst example is not too far from you: the
3:18:02
Galveston Hurricane of 1900.
3:18:03
Yeah.
3:18:04
8,000 people.
3:18:05
I know.
3:18:05
My grandma kept a picture of that.
3:18:09
There was nothing left but a couple polls and the sea wall, part of the sea wall.
3:18:16
Well, they didn’t have a sea wall then.
3:18:16
They built the sea wall after it happened.
3:18:17
Yeah, that’s what it was.
3:18:18
After that mess.
3:18:21
I mean that’s a classic example of before there were planes and before there
3:18:28
were satellites how did you do that?
3:18:31
Right.
3:18:33
The hurricane people in Cuba right after the U.S. basically as a spoils of war
3:18:40
after the Spanish-American War got Cuba from Spain and of course the Cubans
3:18:46
were experts at hurricane predictions.
3:18:48
They didn’t name them back then.
3:18:50
It was just the hurricane of 1900.
3:18:53
They knew it came by Cuba and they tried to warn the gulf coast and
3:18:59
because it wasn’t really integrated into the U.S. Weather Service yet, and
3:19:04
there was also a racial thing to it.
3:19:06
The Latinos.
3:19:07
They didn’t listen to it.
3:19:09
Of course—
3:19:10
They paid the price.
3:19:11
It was a Cat [category] 4, probably.
3:19:14
The storm surge is what took out Galveston.
3:19:17
I mean there wasn’t much left of the city.
3:19:20
Right.
3:19:23
That’s the kind of thing you have to look forward to [laughs] . I’m
3:19:27
scaring the crap out of you here as we’re doing this interview, but I’m
3:19:31
just trying to get you to talk about anything you want to about that.
3:19:37
I’m going to ask you some unrelated questions, but I want to make sure I fill
3:19:40
all the gaps of what I wanted to cover.
3:19:46
You being an artistic guy, too, has it been rather enjoyable, even
3:19:52
interesting, for you to see the arts and humanities aspect of the LTER
3:19:58
thing become developed like it is?
3:20:01
Oh yeah.
3:20:01
Largely because of Fred Swanson but also because of Charles Goodrich and other
3:20:05
people that have been very involved.
3:20:07
You want to tell me a little about that?
3:20:08
How you’ve seen science embrace the arts and the humanities in a very formal sense?
3:20:15
I’m absolutely thrilled because that was non-existent for many years.
3:20:22
It was basically head down study, you know?
3:20:25
We don’t have time for all that foo-foo [laughs] . You know?
3:20:33
Some call it.
3:20:35
But anyway, I am.
3:20:36
I’m thrilled to death to see that beginning to take effect and take root.
3:20:43
I think it’s going to grow.
3:20:45
It’s a growing trend seeing the arts and humanities displaying
3:20:52
the scientific aspects.
3:20:53
That is just an eye opener for me.
3:21:00
I’ve seen some beautiful results.
3:21:03
I just, yes, I’m excited.
3:21:05
Like Leah Wilson’s work?
3:21:07
I know it.
3:21:08
Yes.
3:21:08
And
3:21:11
the gentleman who was the reporter for the Register Guard who does the
3:21:16
repaints of the old photographs, the colorizations.
3:21:19
I’m forgetting his name, and I’m sorry for the record.
3:21:20
[Bob Keefer]
3:21:21
I am too.
3:21:22
Yeah, that is so cool.
3:21:25
I’m glad to see that happening.
3:21:27
Fred Swanson picked a good, he made a good choice getting that program going.
3:21:34
I think he was always prone to being a kind of renaissance man, scientist.
3:21:39
I think as he became more integrated into the LTER system and planning—
3:21:45
She got out alive!
3:21:46
I did!
3:21:46
We’ll take a break here for a sec— [recording cuts off and
3:21:47
restarts] . Continue on with the arts and humanities thing.
3:21:51
You were right in the middle of that.
3:21:53
You were talking about Fred and seeing that develop and—
3:21:57
Yeah, I think we were just about buttoning that up.
3:22:00
Anyway, I’m just—
3:22:01
Okay, maybe we were.
3:22:01
I’m really impressed with Fred Swanson’s efforts to get that going.
3:22:05
I think it’s going to be a growing trend just to follow that up again.
3:22:11
Oh, man.
3:22:12
And you of all people appreciate the interface between the
3:22:16
arts and other things.
3:22:19
Yeah.
3:22:19
Because a lot of people think science not the arts.
3:22:21
Right.
3:22:21
It’s one or the other, not both.
3:22:22
They don’t think of mechanical things and the arts.
3:22:27
In your case.
3:22:28
So, you identified the interfaces and the relationships and
3:22:32
how they support each other.
3:22:34
Yep.
3:22:34
Exactly.
3:22:35
They do.
3:22:37
It’s a valuable asset I
3:22:42
think not only to the science community, but to the public community.
3:22:48
I think it’s going to create better understanding, better communication.
3:22:53
Well, you know back in the beginning of the modern science era, back
3:22:57
in the late 1700s, early 1800s the scientific disciplines that
3:23:03
we know of today were not formed.
3:23:05
There was a few, but the arts and the sciences were more fused back then.
3:23:11
That’s right.
3:23:12
Then as they became developed in the modern science, they became stove piped
3:23:17
in deep, deep wells of information, methodology where you had to become a
3:23:22
specialist to survive in your discipline and I think we’ve kind of lost—
3:23:28
Lost a connection.
3:23:29
Well, the connection with the holism of everything.
3:23:33
Yes.
3:23:33
That’s right.
3:23:34
Not everybody, but—and the people like Fred I think identify that
3:23:39
and understand that and I think the LTER science sites that are
3:23:45
really developed really understand that and are going forward.
3:23:50
Now, this Andrews is probably a really shining example of how the
3:23:56
arts and humanities have really gone strong and there’s a few
3:23:59
other LTERs that are that way.
3:24:01
Some of them not so much.
3:24:04
That’s just a matter of leadership but also staffing and limitations
3:24:07
and funding and personalities and there’s a million different things
3:24:11
that go into stuff like that.
3:24:15
Oh man, you caught him.
3:24:16
Good job.
3:24:17
Over by the dumpster.
3:24:19
They were having a blast.
3:24:21
What’d you catch?
3:24:22
Chipmunks.
3:24:23
The chipmunks were out and about.
3:24:23
Chipmunks?
3:24:23
I’m going to turn this off for—
3:24:27
[recording cuts out and begins again] . If you had a wish list and you were going
3:24:31
to be here for another 10 years, for example, and you wanted to see this thing
3:24:36
become completed, maybe even to another level of high functionality, aesthetic
3:24:41
beauty, whatever, what do you think this place needs to move up even better?
3:24:47
Just more maintenance or a little more of what?
3:24:52
I think the big one I think, and I think it’s in safe hands for
3:24:58
that, is going to be the grounds.
3:25:02
I just haven’t had much time to pay much attention to all the plants,
3:25:08
plant beds, and almost all the buildings need—well, all the buildings
3:25:14
need either all of it or more.
3:25:18
There still a little naked.
3:25:20
A little more landscaping is what we need.
3:25:22
Okay.
3:25:23
Finish dressing things up.
3:25:25
Basically putting a few more conifers and other bushes that
3:25:30
really do good in this climate.
3:25:31
Native stock, mm-hmm.
3:25:33
We try to focus on native stock.
3:25:34
Well, you really want to obviously.
3:25:36
Well, yeah because of the particular environment that we’re in.
3:25:41
You don’t want to bring any grasses in, a la false brome.
3:25:45
Right
3:25:48
[laughs] . That ain’t going to happen.
3:25:49
But we’ve got some native, well, not so much—anyway, we got a few invasive
3:25:56
species that we just won’t let go of that we’ve been told we’re not
3:26:01
supposed to allow, like foxglove.
3:26:04
Sorry, anywhere on the campus, you mean?
3:26:05
Yeah, on the facility.
3:26:06
Now it’s escaped into the woods?
3:26:08
Foxglove is here to stay.
3:26:09
Okay.
3:26:10
I love foxglove.
3:26:11
I think it’s gorgeous.
3:26:13
But it’s not natural.
3:26:15
Yeah.
3:26:19
The wild stuff.
3:26:21
It’s an invasive species.
3:26:24
I didn’t know that, but I found out through the Forest Service botanist that
3:26:28
we’re not supposed to encourage foxglove.
3:26:31
It’s a beautiful plant when it’s blooming, when it’s got its
3:26:36
little bells hanging, you know?
3:26:38
That’s just cool.
3:26:40
Oh well.
3:26:42
What about the other buildings over there, like the main office
3:26:47
and some of those structures over there, even some of the dorms.
3:26:50
What do you think they could use?
3:26:53
Or what kind of upgrades do you think they will need soon, or do you
3:26:57
think they’re pretty set for now?
3:26:59
I think they’re pretty set for now.
3:27:02
We have a good maintenance program started.
3:27:07
You know, program of maintenance, keeping up with your exterior painting, new
3:27:16
roofing and all of that kind of thing.
3:27:19
It’s pretty much on schedule.
3:27:23
I’m glad to see that.
3:27:24
The more of it we’re starting to document more and more of the history
3:27:32
as being part of the documented record.
3:27:36
I think that’s critical.
3:27:37
I never really kept up with that very well.
3:27:41
Now, let me ask you a very practical question from the fact of what
3:27:44
I’ve been doing in the archive and all of the historical documents,
3:27:48
including the plants and everything from the first flumes that were put
3:27:52
in in 1951 to all the other stuff,
3:27:59
how would really organized professional curation of those records, just like
3:28:04
what I’m doing will help the science, how do you perceive that will help
3:28:09
the people that comes after you or after that person in terms of knowing
3:28:15
the history of this place in terms of the infrastructure and maintenance.
3:28:18
Right.
3:28:21
Where it’ll come in the most, it’ll be the handiest will be for the
3:28:26
future maintenance people because they have something to go back
3:28:29
to look at like a water heater.
3:28:32
Well, yeah, I know that water heater isn’t very old, but how old is it?
3:28:39
Is it worth saving?
3:28:41
Or
3:28:43
is it time to let it go?
3:28:45
In other words, the liner splitter, something inside.
3:28:47
Mm-hmm.
3:28:47
Right.
3:28:49
Or even if you got a 20-year-old water heater that has lost an element, well, why
3:28:57
change the element if it’s 20 years old.
3:29:00
You know the tank’s going to be next.
3:29:03
So, let it go.
3:29:06
If you have a history you go back to that page and say, oh yeah it was replaced
3:29:13
in 2005, so it’s still worth saving.
3:29:17
Let’s go ahead and repair it.
3:29:19
This is a real practical question because I am literally
3:29:22
organizing those files right now.
3:29:23
Do you have a lot of blueprints and records in your shop too, Terry?
3:29:25
I do.
3:29:26
Blueprints.
3:29:29
Okay, so you’re covered for a lot of this stuff, right?
3:29:32
Yeah.
3:29:33
I would say a good 80% we have accumulated.
3:29:39
Okay.
3:29:41
Especially for the site managers.
3:29:43
It’ll be a big help.
3:29:46
What we have begun to do this past year is to start a computer aspect
3:29:54
of it, rather than hard copy stuff.
3:29:56
Digitize.
3:29:57
Yeah, digitize.
3:29:58
So, you’ve been able to digitize some of the big plans?
3:30:01
Mm-hmm.
3:30:01
Oh, you have?
3:30:02
Yep.
3:30:03
Oh, okay.
3:30:06
Some have been digitized and some haven’t.
3:30:07
Now, who’s going to replace you?
3:30:08
Or is it going to be a collection of people?
3:30:10
Already has happened.
3:30:12
Who’s that’s going to be?
3:30:13
His name’s Rod Fouts.
3:30:15
He’s 62 years old.
3:30:16
Rod Fouts?
3:30:17
Fouts: F-O-U-T-S.
3:30:20
Got it.
3:30:22
He started today.
3:30:23
Today was his first day.
3:30:26
Is he going to stay on campus?
3:30:27
Or is he going to live down—
3:30:28
Yes, he has a fifth-wheel trailer and he’s going to bring it up here.
3:30:34
Eventually he’ll set it up to live in.
3:30:37
That’s his preference, probably right next to this house
3:30:44
and go from there.
3:30:45
First, he’ll probably live in here until he gets the grounds
3:30:49
developed and utilities.
3:30:51
So, he’ll live in your old house here?
3:30:53
Mm-hmm.
3:30:53
Okay.
3:30:53
Until he gets his fifth-wheel functional and then
3:31:00
turn it over to whatever they end up deciding to do with it.
3:31:05
Have you been going over the ropes with him recently?
3:31:10
Not really, but he’s worked with me up here before a couple summers.
3:31:14
Oh, okay so he knows some things about the place.
3:31:16
Mm-hmm.
3:31:16
Okay, gotcha.
3:31:17
He’s not entirely in the dark.
3:31:20
Plus, I’ve been spending a lot of overtime with Doug Fairrington, our temporary,
3:31:27
not temporary but part-time helper.
3:31:29
He’s here part-time year-round, fortunately.
3:31:34
I’ve spent a lot of time training him and orienting him with program of maintenance.
3:31:42
Where all the components are, the plans, and the specs and locations
3:31:49
of all the mechanical components and all that kind of stuff.
3:31:53
He’ll be able to carry over a lot of that to Rod, and in lieu of that they
3:32:01
have my phone number on my smartphone.
3:32:03
I get the feeling you’ll be contacted a few times.
3:32:06
Yeah.
3:32:09
You just can’t spell all that out in the drop of a hat.
3:32:14
It just ain’t going to happen.
3:32:16
Not for me.
3:32:17
I can’t get it all out.
3:32:19
Well, there’ll be some growing pains for a while because continuity
3:32:23
is lost and certain things.
3:32:25
You can’t teach everything.
3:32:27
People have to learn on their own.
3:32:28
There’s a lot of stuff that takes a trigger.
3:32:31
I can foresee them calling me on the phone and saying Terry we got—and I’ll
3:32:35
say, oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that one [laughs] . That kind of thing.
3:32:41
I’m sure that will happen a lot.
3:32:47
It just doesn’t come to mind until after the fact.
3:32:55
How does it feel to be leaving a place like the Andrews which has had
3:32:59
such a profound legacy impact on its operations and character, meaning you?
3:33:05
This has been your life for a big part of your life for so long.
3:33:08
Yeah.
3:33:09
And you made a big impact.
3:33:11
How does it feel to be contemplating leaving in a few days?
3:33:16
It started off being like when I lost my wife.
3:33:20
That’s how bad it hurt.
3:33:22
A
3:33:26
lot of times my depression was just too strong and I’m the kind
3:33:33
that when that hits I go to bed.
3:33:35
That’s my answer.
3:33:37
I’ve spent a lot of bed time.
3:33:39
Doug!
3:33:39
Hey!
3:33:40
Here comes another question!
3:33:41
Here comes another question about—we just talked about this guy Doug and he
3:33:46
just walked in the door and now I’m going to do a psychological profile [laughs]
3:33:52
. Right [laughs]
3:33:52
. No, I’m going to turn the record off just for a sec here.
3:33:55
Oh, actually, you know what I will do.
3:33:56
I will not do that.
3:33:57
Doug?
3:33:58
You got your interview going.
3:33:59
We’re almost done.
3:34:00
We’re finishing up.
3:34:00
Almost.
3:34:01
Winding down.
3:34:02
Doug you want to say something on the record about this guy for history’s sake?
3:34:09
I think you probably already covered the uniqueness of his presence here, that
3:34:17
it’s not just maintenance and repairs and building and construction and fabrication.
3:34:27
It’s art.
3:34:30
You know the artistry of painting and trim and furniture.
3:34:40
His thumbprints are all over this place and most of it folks don’t even know
3:34:45
that it was his because he just did it.
3:34:50
It’s
3:34:53
going to be a passing era.
3:34:58
Say a little bit about what he helped you do down at your church.
3:35:02
How’d you find out about that?
3:35:04
He told me about it.
3:35:05
Because I called to get a hold of you.
3:35:08
For the record, Doug, how do you spell your last name?
3:35:10
Fairrington is F-A-I-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N.
3:35:14
For the transcriber who will do this.
3:35:15
Okay, so go on.
3:35:19
We actually honored him Sunday and his sister, Cathy, came down and we
3:35:25
tried not to embarrass him too much.
3:35:27
Yeah.
3:35:28
I appreciate that.
3:35:28
Now they’ll save the embarrassment for tomorrow night.
3:35:31
It wasn’t too painful, was it?
3:35:31
It wasn’t too bad.
3:35:34
But I just acknowledged that 20 years ago he led a group of volunteers to
3:35:40
build an addition onto the church that we now have as classroom
3:35:44
space and office space and kitchen.
3:35:47
I didn’t even know when I came to work here a year ago that TC
3:35:54
was the hand that painted the mural on the men’s bathroom wall
3:36:01
with a passage, a Bible passage, on there.
3:36:03
Are you talking about down at the church?
3:36:04
Yeah, down at the church.
3:36:05
Inside the—there was a window there and he made use of the—
3:36:09
What Bible passage?
3:36:10
I’m just curious.
3:36:16
Yeah.
3:36:17
Habakkuk 3:19, do you remember?
3:36:17
That rings a bell.
3:36:17
I bet that’s it.
3:36:18
I’ll have to look at it.
3:36:19
Although I would have just had something more simple that said
3:36:22
this too will pass [laughs]
3:36:23
. [Laughs] Yeah.
3:36:25
There you go.
3:36:27
But one of the things that we mentioned is you know our church is doing well now.
3:36:33
We’re mostly full.
3:36:35
Yeah.
3:36:37
We have days that are standing-room only.
3:36:40
I just mentioned that he and one of the elders 20 years ago while they were
3:36:46
building that place would also pray and pray over the facility and we’re
3:36:51
experiencing the fruit of those prayers.
3:36:55
He’s
3:36:59
leaving quite a legacy.
3:37:01
He’s done well.
3:37:02
And not done yet.
3:37:03
He’s finishing strong.
3:37:04
We’re just going through another—
3:37:04
He’s finishing strong with
3:37:06
this, because what he’s doing today is actually really important.
3:37:11
Yeah.
3:37:11
I mean this has been a long, 3 1/2, 3 hour and 40-minute interview and these
3:37:16
are part of the legacies you leave.
3:37:19
Most people don’t get a chance to do something like this.
3:37:22
This will be down, transcribed, and put in an archive and there you go.
3:37:26
Well,
3:37:28
most maintenance managers of their companies haven’t spent 30 years, 35 years
3:37:40
developing something from the ground up.
3:37:43
They’ve been there 5 years or 10 years and when they hired on it was already there.
3:37:47
They’re just there as maintenance.
3:37:50
You don’t look at that person as a part of the history, you know, so
3:37:54
much as you would somebody like Terry.
3:37:57
This was all, I don’t know if you were around when this was a field and a bunch
3:38:03
of, they called it ghetto in the meadow.
3:38:05
I know the history, but I wasn’t here.
3:38:07
Yeah.
3:38:07
Well, he was here.
3:38:09
Yeah, I know.
3:38:10
He’s one of the reasons why it’s not a ghetto in the meadow any more, a bunch
3:38:16
of mobile homes that the floor is rotting through.
3:38:19
There’s buildings here and you know he’s been able to see through that.
3:38:23
Even during the ghetto in the meadow you were into survival.
3:38:26
Exactly.
3:38:27
We talked about that early on, too.
3:38:29
Exactly.
3:38:29
Yeah
3:38:33
and the artistic thing I mean I talked with him.
3:38:35
It’s unique.
3:38:36
I’ve met other people similar to, they have a dual thing like
3:38:41
that, but I mean it’s not typical.
3:38:43
Let’s put it that way.
3:38:44
It’s not typical.
3:38:46
They may not be in one place for so many years to have long
3:38:53
enough to be able to leave such a broad-stroked impact in history.
3:39:00
Exactly.
3:39:01
The Andrews has its own unique strength as a scientific research site which doesn’t
3:39:07
always happen even in that context.
3:39:08
They either get discontinued, they get defunded, the leadership quits/leaves.
3:39:14
You don’t have the legacy factor or the continuity where somebody like Terry and
3:39:19
all the other people in their different facets can leave their stamp on a place.
3:39:25
We have artists that come here, and we have
3:39:30
contractors that come here and people who come to do repairs and do maintenance and
3:39:37
you know contractors, but very few of them are doing all of those at the same time
3:39:48
in one location.
3:39:50
We were just talking about science.
3:39:52
Even science has become so specialized that people don’t
3:39:56
talk across the disciplines.
3:39:58
Just like Terry, you know, growing up where he did in his dad’s shop and
3:40:02
jack-of-all-trades, a lot of people even in the construction industry
3:40:06
they don’t become that anymore.
3:40:07
They become specialists.
3:40:08
Specialists in one field.
3:40:10
Again, what’s unique about this address is I’ve got a friend that is a
3:40:18
musician, concert musician, and has a construction company and is an artist.
3:40:27
But
3:40:29
he goes to work in one place and builds something.
3:40:33
He goes home and writes music.
3:40:35
Goes someplace else and performs and then goes over here and paints something.
3:40:45
They’re not connected, where Terry’s lived here, served here,
3:40:50
and done all that right here.
3:40:54
That’s unique.
3:40:56
Because you can see the artistry in the construction.
3:41:05
You might build something and then paint the wall with a mural.
3:41:15
Matter of fact, we were talking the other day and he goes, yeah, I painted a
3:41:20
mural on a church wall in Elgin, Oregon.
3:41:24
It was so many years ago he didn’t remember what town it was.
3:41:27
I got on the computer and pulled up a map and he was somewhere
3:41:30
over in southeast Oregon.
3:41:36
Northeast.
3:41:36
Yeah, northeast Oregon.
3:41:37
A former employee here moved there to pastor a church and called
3:41:41
him like 25 years ago, maybe?
3:41:44
Who knows.
3:41:46
Called him and said hey, come make this wall look nice.
3:41:50
You can go right now on Google earth, drop on main street in Elgin,
3:41:55
Oregon and do a, you know, a scan of the town and see that wall that he
3:42:03
painted on the side of their building.
3:42:05
The mural’s still there.
3:42:06
I’m kind of surprised.
3:42:07
Wow.
3:42:07
There on Main Street.
3:42:09
That’s pretty amazing, man.
3:42:10
I remember it because I hunt over there.
3:42:12
I drive through Elgin.
3:42:13
I’ve seen that mural on that wall.
3:42:15
And now you know.
3:42:16
I said are you serious?
3:42:18
You painted that!
3:42:18
I know that guy!
3:42:20
Anyway—
3:42:20
How cool.
3:42:20
Off the record.
3:42:22
Yeah,
3:42:25
here, I’ll turn it off [recording stops and starts again] . Continue on
3:42:29
with how you feel about leaving again.
3:42:31
Go ahead with that.
3:42:32
Finish that thought.
3:42:34
Like I said it was like when I lost my wife.
3:42:38
It was very difficult at first.
3:42:41
So, you’ve been grieving for a while.
3:42:43
I’ve been grieving, yeah, ever since I actually made the commitment.
3:42:47
When was that?
3:42:48
Probably 3, 4 months ago I actually, I mean I made the commitment back in
3:43:00
May when I went ahead and made the appointment for PERS [State of Oregon
3:43:05
retirement system] and Social Security and all of that, but it didn’t really
3:43:09
kick in until about 3 months ago was when Social Security actually kicked
3:43:16
in and that became more of a reality.
3:43:21
And, of course, going ahead and
3:43:25
telling my sister, yeah, I’ll go ahead and come up.
3:43:27
I could use the help.
3:43:29
I knew then—
3:43:31
It was real.
3:43:32
It’s real.
3:43:32
It’s over.
3:43:34
It’s hard to accept at first.
3:43:36
It was very difficult.
3:43:43
That’s about all I can say.
3:43:44
It’s just very difficult.
3:43:46
It’s a culture shock, kind of.
3:43:50
Even though you’re going back to your original culture, right?
3:43:52
Right.
3:43:54
Well, over 35/40 years you’ve become a different person to some degree.
3:43:59
Yeah.
3:43:59
You’re still a member of that family and community, but you’re also an Oregonian.
3:44:04
You’re an Andrew-ian.
3:44:08
Yeah, that’s what I was going to say about the culture shock going back down south.
3:44:14
Well I’ve learned to be like the Oregonian to respect personal space.
3:44:19
Ah, okay.
3:44:21
Oregonians personal space is about 3 feet.
3:44:25
In Louisiana personal space is only 3 inches, in your face friendly.
3:44:32
That’s going to take a little adjusting.
3:44:35
It’s very different.
3:44:38
What would you say are the favorite memories that you have about this?
3:44:41
Oh, my word.
3:44:42
I mean you’ve mentioned a lot, but something maybe you haven’t talked about.
3:44:46
Something, some poignant thing, something that was important and maybe
3:44:53
in a way that I couldn’t foresee when I was putting these questions together.
3:44:58
I think your senses are very different here.
3:45:06
The things you smell, the things you hear, and the things you feel that
3:45:13
makes your skin tingle are completely different than which you experience
3:45:18
in the valley or in Louisiana.
3:45:22
There’s something about the cleanliness of being in the forest.
3:45:26
It’s totally different than anywhere else.
3:45:31
The little fairyland places in the old-growth forest that
3:45:46
makes you want to bow down and worship feeling.
3:45:50
You feel there’s almost like the trees could talk, if they wanted.
3:45:58
You’re in the presence of—
3:46:01
Something real.
3:46:02
The spirits, the gods, whatever you want to describe it as.
3:46:04
Yeah, whatever you want to call it.
3:46:07
It’s very unique.
3:46:09
It has its own
3:46:13
history, its own life.
3:46:18
I’m going to miss it, but there’s things similar to that down in the
3:46:25
National Forest in Louisiana, you know.
3:46:29
Whispering pines.
3:46:30
The cypress swamps?
3:46:31
Yep, the cypress swamps.
3:46:38
What are you looking forward to the most about getting back there?
3:46:43
What’s going to be the most fun or cool thing about going back to
3:46:47
your homeland, based on not only your family but certainly the
3:46:51
cultural, the cuisine, what have you?
3:46:53
Yeah, it’s a little bit of everything like that.
3:46:56
because it’s something my senses haven’t tasted, really, in 40 years.
3:47:07
A good 40 years, the smells, the sounds, the feelings, the people.
3:47:18
Looking at the flat land, the swampland, the short trees.
3:47:25
A giant tree down there is only 100’ tall.
3:47:28
The pines, usually, right?
3:47:30
Yeah.
3:47:32
Wow.
3:47:35
Now, your mother, you’re going to be living with your mom?
3:47:36
Yep.
3:47:36
Be living with Mom and my sister and I’m looking forward to that
3:47:45
with fear and trepidation.
3:47:48
[Laughs] I heard that.
3:47:49
Oh, you caught that?
3:47:51
Well, that’s normal Cathy.
3:47:54
Oh yeah.
3:47:54
Same on my side, too.
3:47:57
Yeah, it’ll be like all the sibling stuff you thought you buried 40 years
3:48:02
ago is going to come back [laughs]
3:48:04
. [Laughs] Right.
3:48:05
Uh-oh.
3:48:09
Yeah, I’m looking forward that really.
3:48:14
I’ll have a family again after losing my wife.
3:48:19
Looking forward to that aspect.
3:48:24
New friends.
3:48:28
Now, do you plan on continuing your art and craftsmanship in any particular
3:48:33
way upon your return to Louisiana?
3:48:35
I’m sure you will but you want to kind of give me your thoughts and ideas about
3:48:41
keeping going in that kind of area?
3:48:43
That’s a longer-range hope that I’ve had for a long time.
3:48:49
I want to dabble in oil painting and watercolor.
3:48:56
I’ve been most of my artwork, 90% of my artwork has been acrylic and
3:49:06
I want to, now that I’m on easy street, so to speak, I want to go ahead and
3:49:10
spend the money for artist paints.
3:49:14
Well, there you go.
3:49:15
And give it a whirl.
3:49:19
Why not?
3:49:20
Yeah.
3:49:21
And hobbies.
3:49:22
I’m downscaling my sizes in building models which makes
3:49:28
it even more of a challenge.
3:49:30
Those great big models in the shop, that’s nothing compared to making
3:49:36
the little ones from scratch.
3:49:38
Especially when you’re talking about the fine points of painting and all
3:49:42
that.
3:49:42
Yeah, when you start working on the details you gotta pull
3:49:45
out the magnifying glass.
3:49:46
So, Cathy, what if you guys come home and he’s painted murals
3:49:51
all over your family home?
3:49:53
I would love
3:49:57
that!
3:49:58
We have one.
3:49:58
A little bathroom we did one.
3:49:59
The half bath they call them, I put a mural on that one, three-sided.
3:50:06
The year our dad was dying he did that.
3:50:06
A kind of a landscape mural.
3:50:08
I want an ocean mural in the other bathroom.
3:50:11
Yeah, I know.
3:50:13
We’ll see
3:50:16
[laughs]
3:50:16
. [Laughs]
3:50:16
. So,
3:50:20
in terms of your presence at the Andrews and amongst the McKenzie
3:50:23
River Valley community how would you like to most be remembered?
3:50:30
Nothing fancy.
3:50:31
Just simple.
3:50:33
I came, I saw, and conquered.
3:50:37
Period.
3:50:40
Said Julius Caesar.
3:50:43
I gave the Andrews my heart and soul and I don’t regret a minute of it.
3:50:48
I gave them 120% for many, many years and I don’t regret a minute of it.
3:50:55
It’s been a beautiful trip the whole, whole time.
3:50:58
Even the nightmares.
3:51:01
That’s a cool way of looking at it.
3:51:04
Now, are there any other people that we haven’t talked about, or any other that
3:51:08
you would want to make a comment on about their presence that we didn’t talk about?
3:51:12
You talked about Fred and you talked about John.
3:51:16
You mentioned Al briefly, Al Levno.
3:51:18
Yep, Al Levno.
3:51:19
You know those critical people I could have made none of the stuff
3:51:26
happen without their support, their help and their support.
3:51:29
Al Levno, Art McKee, Fred Swanson... Jerry Franklin not so much because he was mostly
3:51:38
focused on the academics you know while we were busy with all the other fun stuff.
3:51:45
Yeah, John Moreau,
3:51:49
Craig Creel, Greg Downing, who’s still with us.
3:51:53
All those people.
3:51:55
The seasonal help that I’ve had.
3:51:57
Our regular staff down at
3:52:00
the office: Kathy
3:52:03
Keable.
3:52:05
I miss Kathy already.
3:52:06
You got a nice person to replace her, but still Kathy was cool.
3:52:08
I know.
3:52:09
She was cool.
3:52:10
Oh yeah.
3:52:12
Yeah.
3:52:13
They were very good at taking care of me.
3:52:16
They did a great job.
3:52:18
Mark [Schulze] , to say the least.
3:52:21
What a dynamic young man.
3:52:25
He replaced Kari, right?
3:52:26
Kari O’Connell was here
3:52:29
for a few years.
3:52:30
Yep.
3:52:31
She was the one between Mark and Art McKee who was here forever.
3:52:34
Yeah.
3:52:36
He was the original.
3:52:39
Yeah, sweet Kari O’Connell.
3:52:42
She was a wonderful, wonderful site administrator.
3:52:46
I was sad when she gave it up, but I could understand she made up her mind.
3:52:53
Her family was more important, so she had to tone her career down a little bit.
3:52:59
I could understand that.
3:53:01
But Mark is an excellent replacement.
3:53:03
Dang, he’s a good man.
3:53:06
Full of energy, contentious, courteous, always courteous.
3:53:13
Even if he’s mad at you, he’s courteous.
3:53:16
That boy can give you a spanking and you wouldn’t know it until two days later.
3:53:24
That sounds like a southern aphorism to me.
3:53:33
He’s an excellent site administrator.
3:53:38
Well, Terry.
3:53:40
All the people.
3:53:41
All the staff, even the research community has been a big help to me.
3:53:49
They helped make it happen.
3:53:52
Well, I hope you’re going to keep in touch with these folks and they’ll
3:53:57
visit you down there sometime.
3:53:58
Oh yeah, at least the base staff I’ll keep in touch with them.
3:54:04
Now you got email and all that kind of stuff.
3:54:06
I know.
3:54:08
You can send them Christmas cards for free.
3:54:10
You don’t even need to buy a card anymore.
3:54:11
That’s right.
3:54:14
Actually, I like sending real cards anymore.
3:54:17
I still like the feeling of sending something real to people.
3:54:20
Yeah, my sister’s like that.
3:54:21
She loves to send a card.
3:54:25
She gets it from my momma.
3:54:27
Our momma loves sending cards.
3:54:30
All kinds of cards.
3:54:31
Your momma and my momma both.
3:54:32
Well,
3:54:35
Terry, I think we have more than—
3:54:37
We covered it pretty good?
3:54:40
We covered the history of the world parts one, two, and three.
3:54:42
Good!
3:54:43
As well as your role here at the Andrews.
3:54:45
I want to thank you from myself and giving me an enjoyable day here talking
3:54:51
to you and meeting your sister and
3:54:55
being able to add to the historical knowledge and the memories as we
3:55:00
call recording living memories of
3:55:04
an important person to this wonderful place the H.J. Andrews Experimental
3:55:09
Forest and I want to thank you very much for doing everything you’ve done here
3:55:13
but also for making my day enjoyable.
3:55:17
Good, thank you.
3:55:18
Thank you, Sir.
3:55:18
You’re welcome.
3:55:19
Signing off!
3:55:20
Alright.
