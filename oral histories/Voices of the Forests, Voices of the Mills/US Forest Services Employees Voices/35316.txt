00:02
Good morning.
00:04
It is December 1, 2017.
00:07
This is Dr. Samuel J. Schmieding, Oregon State University College of Forestry
00:11
here in the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Science Laboratory and we are
00:16
here with Dr. Richard Iverson, Senior Research Hydrologist with the USGS.
00:23
Been with the USGS 35 years and most of that time he's been
00:26
stationed at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington.
00:31
Today we are going to do an oral history interview which is part of Group
00:35
II of the H.J. Andrews Oral History Project which started back in 2013.
00:41
We're going to talk about Dick's career in geology with a specific focus on the
00:48
debris flow flume which was built at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest
00:52
in the early 1990s, but we're not going to be limited to that subject.
00:56
Anyway, good morning, Dick, how are you?
00:57
Good morning.
00:57
I'm just fine.
00:58
I want to thank you for being willing to meet with me.
01:01
These are always a process and they're interesting.
01:04
I really appreciate it.
01:06
Let's just start at the very beginning.
01:09
Where were you born and raised, or just give me a little biographical
01:12
sketch, however you want to.
01:13
I was born in Southern Minnesota in a small town called Albert Lea, Minnesota.
01:18
My parents were living on a farm at that time working as farmers.
01:23
I spent most of my childhood, however, in Iowa.
01:26
When I was too young to remember we moved from Minnesota to Iowa and I
01:31
grew up in several different towns.
01:33
The ones that I remember most distinctly were Denison, Iowa;
01:37
Ames, Iowa; and Sioux City, Iowa.
01:40
During that time, my father was working for the Iowa State University Extension
01:44
Service and was changing jobs, sort of moving up the ladder of responsibility.
01:50
That's why we shipped it from town to town.
01:55
So,
01:58
you understand Lake Wobegon humor, then, right?
02:01
I absolutely understand Lake Wobegon humor.
02:04
I understand a lot about how university politics work.
02:08
Both my brother and sister are university professors.
02:11
Really?
02:11
In what field?
02:13
Actually, my brother is also a geologist.
02:15
His specialty is glaciology and he's at Iowa State University where both he and
02:19
I were undergraduates many years ago.
02:22
Then my sister, who's older than me, is a professor of landscape architecture
02:26
at the University of Michigan.
02:28
So, you're a Cyclone fan?
02:29
I'm a Cyclone fan.
02:30
They're pretty good this year in football.
02:32
Kind of dyed in the wool.
02:33
Once you're hooked as a kid that doesn't go away.
02:36
They actually have a pretty good football team this year.
02:38
They did pretty well.
02:39
They even beat Oklahoma, if you can believe that.
02:41
The only team to beat Oklahoma.
02:42
Yeah, I know.
02:43
I watched it.
02:45
I unfortunately didn't see the game, but I heard about it.
02:46
I was very pleased because I don't like Baker Mayfield.
02:50
What
02:55
was your childhood like, especially in relation to the natural world?
02:58
You were in the Midwest in rolling hills, farm, flat country.
03:01
Exactly.
03:02
Tell me about that.
03:05
I think largely because of my parents' interests and my dad in
03:10
particular, I always had a real
03:15
sense of connection to the outdoors and to the landscape and so forth.
03:21
Spending time on a farm as a small child visiting my grandparents'
03:25
farm was something that was special.
03:28
Even more importantly for me, and I think what led me to become a
03:31
geologist, was camping trips that we would take to the Rocky Mountain
03:36
states, usually Wyoming or Colorado.
03:39
I remember one camping trip in particular, because I think maybe I was old enough
03:44
at that time to really appreciate things more than I had when I was younger.
03:48
It was 1963 and we took a long camping trip to Grand Teton and Yellowstone
03:55
National Parks, which at that time were a lot less crowded than they are nowadays.
04:00
It was just so spectacular.
04:02
I couldn't imagine anything better than seeing nature exposed in those ways and
04:09
being most impressed of all just with the landscapes and thinking about how they had
04:15
changed over time and what does it take to create this kind of spectacular scenery.
04:22
How would you characterize the contrast between the Midwestern topography and
04:27
ecology with the Rocky Mountains in terms of inspiring you to have a career or doing
04:33
science and studying natural processes?
04:36
The thing about the Midwest, at least the part of it that I grew
04:38
up in, is that there's really remarkably little of it that's
04:43
anything resembling a pristine state.
04:46
The one exception to that might be along a river bottom.
04:49
I did spend a lot of time as a kid playing around in creeks and fishing,
04:56
and so forth and so I did get an exposure to nature in that sense.
05:02
Other than that, things are largely developed.
05:04
Of course, mostly it's farmland.
05:06
You see the landscape very clearly, but it's all covered with crops and
05:10
largely surrounded by fences at that time, because in those days they would
05:13
also turn cattle out in the fields after they were done harvesting.
05:19
There
05:21
was certainly a connection to nature, but seeing things in a more natural state
05:26
as was true in the national forests and the national parks of the west-really,
05:32
to me it was just a tremendous eye-opener to be exposed to that.
05:37
You became a scientist later who would study disturbance processes
05:42
and dynamics to some degree.
05:44
What in the Midwest that maybe other type of disturbances on a very small
05:52
scale maybe, or arroyo cutting or tornadoes, or anything that made
05:57
you think shook you up in thinking about earth and processes in a real
06:03
remedial, even pre-academic kind of way.
06:06
I would say as a boy growing up in these Midwestern towns, again I spent a lot
06:13
of time on, in, and around creeks, small streams, typically no more than 10 m wide.
06:25
I was always really fascinated by just watching what was going
06:28
on with the moving water and the movement of sediment and so forth.
06:31
Of course, it was very conspicuous whenever there was a construction
06:35
project or anything of that nature that was tampering with the creek
06:39
that things changed dramatically.
06:41
You could see the turbidity change and...
06:42
You could see more erosion; you could see that the creek wasn't
06:46
looking the way it used to look.
06:50
I certainly didn't think about it in intellectual terms in those days.
06:55
I was too young, I think, but I think it had a deep imprint on me
07:01
just in terms of thinking about how nature works and how sediment moves
07:05
and the role of water and so forth.
07:08
I was always fascinated by that.
07:11
I remember one experience in particular in a creek near our
07:14
house where we had a particularly cold winter and the creek froze
07:20
essentially solid from top to bottom.
07:22
The ice was over a meter thick.
07:25
In the process of freezing the ice had arched up in various places
07:31
and there were actually tunnels you could get into by clamoring down
07:35
the stream bank and you could get in underneath the ice and be crawling
07:39
around basically on the stream bed.
07:42
You would see frozen fish that were trapped in the ice.
07:45
You could see all these things frozen in time, literally, and get some sense
07:51
of what that stream bed was like, which you ordinarily of course could never get
07:55
just from being there in the summertime.
07:58
Because our streams in the Midwest were never clear mountain brooks.
08:01
You basically couldn't see through the water.
08:03
The water was pretty muddy most of the time.
08:05
Well, and it was also slow moving.
08:06
And slow moving.
08:07
It had a high particulate and organic material content-
08:10
Exactly.
08:10
-built into the matrix of the water.
08:12
Exactly.
08:14
Now, taking off on that, and I'm thinking about mythologies and
08:19
first impressions and how we first see things as a child and how they
08:23
create a mythology and a perception.
08:27
What are your early memories about geologic processes and disturbances
08:30
in particular that you witnessed in person or saw in the media?
08:34
I mean on news, books, films, art, that influenced how you viewed such
08:38
processes as a child and did this create a stereotype that you had to overcome as
08:44
an adult when you became an intellectual.
08:45
I give you the example of myself when I first saw the first pictures
08:50
of Hawaii volcanoes and the runny lava and also a Tarzan movie with
08:56
this very weird stereotypical flow of lava in it from a '30s movie.
09:01
Sure.
09:02
That perception was in my head until I became an adult and studied it.
09:06
Did you ever have something like that that was a perception and then
09:09
you had to counter that and become an adult and an intellectual person?
09:14
I can't think of anything that specific.
09:17
Certainly, where I grew up in Iowa the most profound experiences that one had
09:24
in terms of seeing very powerful natural processes at work were all related to
09:30
weather events, whether it was tornadoes, powerful thunderstorms, hailstorms, we
09:35
had a lot of strong wind, and so there was a great deal of exposure to just how
09:43
unpredictable nature could be in terms of generating these kinds of weather events.
09:48
I think the other thing in those days it's easy to forget now,
09:53
but weather forecasting was much poorer then than it is now.
09:56
They didn't have all the modern technology.
09:58
As a consequence, there were a lot more surprises in the weather.
10:02
Nowadays when tornado weather is forming in the Midwest, generally they can
10:08
anticipate it a couple days in advance.
10:09
And you turn on the weather channel.
10:10
You turn on the weather channel and you track things and then you have
10:13
all the radar images and everything.
10:14
None of that was available then.
10:17
It would just often take you by surprise.
10:19
I remember times being out on just some of these little fishing excursions where
10:25
just seemingly out of nowhere a huge storm would boil up and suddenly this
10:31
small lake has huge waves on it and you're struggling to get back to shore
10:35
on your tippy little boat and so forth.
10:40
I think there was an imprinting at that time in terms of just
10:44
nature in general and how
10:48
unpredictable and sometimes violent it can be, and humans have to learn to adapt
10:55
because we're not going to change this.
10:58
This is just the way nature is.
11:00
We have to be flexible and learn to adapt.
11:03
Did you ever have any close calls with tornados?
11:07
Not terribly close calls.
11:09
There was one circumstance, well, two that stick in my mind.
11:12
I remember once we were driving out on a country road and we saw a tornado
11:15
approaching across the flat terrain probably a mile or two distant.
11:21
Of course, with a tornado you never know exactly which way it's going to
11:24
turn, but generally speaking you can outrun a tornado in a car as long
11:29
as you're not trying to drive toward the tornado as some storm chasers do.
11:34
It wasn't terribly scary, but it was impressive to see it standing out in
11:38
bold relief against the backdrop of sky.
11:41
There was another time when I was a bit older when a tornado
11:43
did pass directly over our house.
11:46
Luckily it did no damage to the house, but it did bring down a tremendous
11:48
amount of wood out of the trees.
11:51
I was a teenager at the time, and I spent a week, at least, cutting up
11:56
wood and so forth, big branches, that have crashed down out of our trees.
12:04
What was the first time you came to the northwest?
12:08
Was that as an adult?
12:10
Yeah, as a very young adult.
12:12
I had never spent any time at all on the west coast prior to moving
12:16
to California to attend graduate school at Stanford in 1977.
12:21
I had only been as far west as Utah prior to that time.
12:25
It was a tremendous adventure for me.
12:28
I remember getting in my old, beat-up jalopy car and driving
12:31
it 2,000 miles mostly across arid lands and then arriving at-
12:35
Praying that it made it, right?
12:36
Yeah, praying that it made it.
12:38
I had plenty of water along just in case.
12:43
Then crossing into California, crossing the Sierras, coming down into the Bay
12:48
Area and everything I felt like I was entering a sort of fairytale world
12:52
because I had heard about this place all my life, but I'd never seen it before.
12:57
That was a big deal.
12:58
Then that very first summer that I spent on the west coast I'd made a
13:03
trip up to the Pacific Northwest.
13:07
My parents and my younger brother had come out on a camping trip, had
13:10
traveled all the way to California and then collectively as a group
13:13
we came up to the northwest.
13:16
That was my first exposure to the volcanos of the northwest.
13:22
Prior to that time, I had never seen a volcano.
13:24
Of course, we passed by a lot of them.
13:28
My brother and I even made kind of a half-hearted attempt to
13:31
climb Mt. Rainier at that time.
13:33
We were under-equipped.
13:35
That's not an easy mountain to climb.
13:37
I climbed it later in my more-informed and more-equipped years.
13:41
At that time, we were poorly informed, poorly equipped and so
13:44
it's probably a good thing that we turned around where we did.
13:46
How far did you make it?
13:48
We made it up to a place called Steamboat Prow.
13:51
That's about 11,000 isn't it?
13:52
About 10,000.
13:52
10,000?
13:52
About 10,000 feet, yeah.
13:55
It's really where one of the two primary climbing routes on Mt. Rainier is,
14:00
but it's really kind of the halfway point in terms of getting to the top.
14:05
Anyway, but it was spectacular because I had always imagined really
14:12
liking and appreciating the Pacific Northwest just based on what I'd read
14:16
and seen on television and so forth.
14:18
I'm going to return to that in just a minute.
14:21
I want to get your impressions of the stratovolcanoes, the
14:24
topography and the geomorphology here, but you did mention Utah.
14:28
For a geologist and especially in terms of geomorphology, that's a paradise.
14:33
Oh yeah.
14:34
A photographer's paradise for me.
14:36
I wrote on
14:39
Canyonland.
14:40
What was the impression you had when you first saw Utah stuff?
14:44
At that time, it was just a very brief and short foray into northern Utah, into
14:50
the Wasatch County and so no exposure to the spectacular Canyonlands country.
14:54
Okay, you didn't see that.
14:55
Okay.
14:55
I didn't see that until many years later.
14:56
Oh, okay.
14:57
Then I'll retreat on that question.
14:58
I thought maybe you went there and you were just so inspired
15:03
you became a geologist.
15:04
It was really more, the single place that inspired me the most was the Tetons.
15:10
You mentioned that early on.
15:11
That spectacular mountain front which is really unlike any other in the United
15:15
States in the sense that there's of course this very flat valley floor of Jackson
15:20
Hole and essentially no foothills between that and the mountain front and so it's
15:25
very impressive and seeing that for the first time really left an imprint on me.
15:30
When you were in high school did you have an affinity for science
15:36
or geology, or did that develop when you got into higher education?
15:41
I certainly had an affinity for science, and particularly for math
15:46
when I was in elementary school student right through high school.
15:50
I took as much science and math as I could.
15:53
I was interested in other subjects as well, but it always seemed to me
15:58
that I probably would want to pursue a career where I could take advantage
16:04
of my interest in mathematics.
16:07
But you didn't really know about geology or whatever until
16:10
you got into college, correct?
16:12
Well, I took an Earth Science class when I was in high school, but
16:16
frankly it was, for lack of a better term, it was a little bit lame.
16:21
We didn't really learn very much, and it wasn't well-connected to other sciences.
16:26
I think part of what makes geology interesting is the way it connects with
16:31
other sciences and that was omitted
16:35
from that high school class.
16:36
One of the coolest things for me was when I got into my doctoral studies
16:40
and I studied under Stephen Pyne and got into all the stuff, the way he
16:45
approaches everything and basically everything we did it was contextualized
16:51
by geology and biology and you would study how Charles Lyell affected
16:56
Charles Darwin and how Humboldt's holism transferred into this and all of a
17:01
sudden to me geology for a historian it's like a sister discipline for me.
17:09
Well, it's interesting you should mention Stephen Pyne because I think I'm correct
17:13
that he's the one who wrote the book, G.K. Gilbert A Great Engine of Research, and
17:19
I think that was based on his Ph.D. work.
17:20
Yes, that was.
17:21
And G.K. Gilbert is more than anyone else the early geologist who
17:26
I've always held in high esteem.
17:29
Because he was into mechanics.
17:30
He was into mechanics.
17:31
He didn't do it mathematically, but he had a very clear conceptual
17:35
understanding of mechanics.
17:38
I've always been a great admirer of G.K. Gilbert, beginning when I
17:41
was in graduate school when I first started learning about his work.
17:44
That was one of my questions.
17:45
What a surprise huh?
17:48
No, but I mean in studying the Colorado Plateau and you look at
17:51
Powell's survey and Clarence Dutton wrote all of the artistic, did all
17:55
the stuff, and Holmes wrote those incredible sketches of the Grand Canyon,
17:59
but Gilbert was the mechanic guy.
18:01
It
18:03
was kind of a balance between, and Powell's kind of a synthesizer
18:06
and government operative.
18:07
Exactly, and the same would be true of Clarence King.
18:10
These guys were all very big-picture guys, whereas Gilbert more than anyone
18:15
else at that time was attentive to detail and thinking about the mechanisms
18:21
by how things actually worked.
18:23
I suppose you've read his analysis of the Henry Mountains?
18:25
Oh yeah.
18:26
I've climbed them, and I took it up there and I read it on top of Mt. Ellen.
18:32
Really?
18:32
I've driven by the Henry Mountains, but I've never
18:34
actually been up into the Henrys.
18:36
They're very isolated.
18:37
Oh yeah.
18:39
It's not something that tourists go to.
18:41
They drive to the parks around there, but it's funny it's the last
18:45
mountain range to be named by the U.S.
18:48
Yeah, well it's so remote and it's small and it's isolated and yeah.
18:53
Very interesting.
18:56
Iowa State, what did you study?
18:59
Did you start in geology or did you kind of develop into that?
19:03
I really didn't know what I wanted to major in when I entered college and
19:09
very quickly, and as I recall this was during my freshman year, I realized
19:15
I was sort of at a bifurcation point because I had this very strong interest
19:20
in science and mathematics, but at the same time I thought that I wanted to
19:25
be a writer because I've always been interested in writing and just beyond
19:29
writing scientific papers, I mean other kinds of writing: essays and
19:32
even a novel and that sort of thing.
19:36
A definitive moment for me was during my freshman year I didn't have a car
19:41
and I was catching a ride from Ames back to Sioux City where my parents
19:45
lived with a guy who was a professor of journalism at the university
19:50
who was a friend of my dad's.
19:52
We
19:54
had 3 hours of time trapped in the car together to talk.
19:58
He was asking me about what I was going to pursue as a career
20:01
and a major and so forth.
20:02
I explained to him that I was struggling between do I choose
20:06
science, or do I choose writing and be an English major or journalism
20:10
major or something of that sort.
20:13
He counseled me.
20:14
He said, if you have an interest and ability in science, I strongly
20:21
encourage you to go into science.
20:23
He said the reason is the following, and he was absolutely right: he said if you
20:29
don't pursue this science education now, you'll never be able to catch up with it
20:35
later, because this is something you have to start learning systematically now.
20:39
It's hard to be an amateur scientist nowadays.
20:43
Back in the days of Powell, he only had a master's degree.
20:47
And he was basically trained in the field.
20:50
Sure, yeah, a lot of them were.
20:51
But you could never even get a job at a university today with that.
20:53
A lot of them were semi-self-trained in those days.
20:56
He said on the other hand with writing this is something you could always
21:00
pursue at a later time, if you choose to.
21:02
It's actually something I'm hoping to do in retirement it
21:05
to spend more time writing other than just my scientific writing.
21:11
I think he was absolutely right.
21:13
It was some of the best advice I've ever received.
21:16
Basically, I made my decision shortly thereafter.
21:18
I'm going to follow the science track and then really what, I was sort of
21:24
debating between geology and physics is what I wanted to specialize in.
21:28
What really sold me was simply the fact that the geology labs were so much fun.
21:35
We would either spend our time going through maps and looking
21:39
at rocks and specimens and fossils or whatever it might be.
21:42
But more importantly we would go on field trips and visit streams where we could see
21:47
things actually happening in real time.
21:49
It was so enjoyable to have that very tangible connection to nature, whereas of
21:55
course physics is very much about nature but it's very much at an abstract level.
21:59
It's not that sort of tangible this is what we see every day in front
22:02
of us, other than at the most basic level of the cup falls on the ground
22:07
if I knock it off the table here.
22:08
You have models and more models.
22:10
Yeah.
22:11
Versus models and nature.
22:12
Exactly.
22:13
Is that a good, crude analogy there?
22:14
I think that's a reasonable analogy.
22:18
I ended up having as an undergraduate my major was in geology.
22:22
I ended up getting minors in both math and physics.
22:24
I continued to pursue those things.
22:26
That's exactly what happened with your career, am I correct?
22:28
That's exactly what happened with my career.
22:30
Because I mean just hearing you talk last night and reading some things
22:33
that you've written, that's kind of who you became in your field.
22:37
Exactly.
22:38
That's very appropriate.
22:40
How did the transition happen out of Iowa State into graduate school?
22:44
Did you get your masters at Iowa State?
22:46
No, just my undergraduate degree.
22:47
Okay.
22:48
Then you moved on to Stanford, or was there another school you went to?
22:51
No, I moved on to Stanford.
22:55
The way that I wound up at Stanford.
22:58
I was frankly not a terribly well-informed student about the nature of graduate
23:04
education and how the larger world worked.
23:10
I only applied to a couple of graduate schools.
23:13
They were both in the west, but they were two very distinctly different places.
23:17
One was Stanford, the other was the University of Montana.
23:21
I think my notion was that if I went to Montana, at that time I was
23:25
already an avid cross-country skier and I probably would've ended up
23:29
majoring in skiing to some degree.
23:31
You would have ended up at Big Mountain or wherever else all the time.
23:37
Something like that, yeah.
23:38
Or down in-what's the one down by Bozeman?
23:39
Yeah...
23:39
I just wasn't aware I think the way students are nowadays in general I
23:43
think students are much better informed and maybe more competitive nowadays
23:47
than they were back then, but I was not acutely aware of the fact that
23:52
there was a hierarchy of universities.
23:54
To me, one university was kind of like another.
23:58
So, you didn't think that when you got accepted to Stanford,
24:01
wow, I'm on the farm now?
24:03
Yeah, it didn't seem like that big of a deal, but in retrospect I'm very
24:07
happy that I went to Stanford because I realize that it opened all sorts of
24:12
doors of opportunity to me that probably wouldn't have been open otherwise,
24:16
not least of which is that Stanford is located only 2 or 3 miles from the
24:22
western regional center of the USGS in Menlo Park, and that was what eventually
24:27
got me established with the USGS.
24:29
I started working there while it was at graduate school at Stanford.
24:34
Going back to Iowa State, but jumping ahead to Stanford, what professors or
24:38
classes or experiences were particularly impactful and pivotal in your career,
24:43
and give me some couple names, perhaps.
24:45
As an undergraduate, certainly at that time the part of geology that
24:52
most attracted me was geomorphology.
24:54
I was interested in what happens where I can see it on the earth's surface and
24:57
it's happening right now, rather than what happened 100 million years ago.
25:01
The geomorphologist that I was with at that time was a guy
25:04
named Robert Palmquist, and I took every class that he taught.
25:08
This was at Iowa State?
25:09
At Iowa State.
25:10
Right.
25:10
I took every class that he taught.
25:12
I also did a couple of independent study projects under him.
25:16
I did a project mapping cirques, glacial cirques, in the Big Horn Mountains
25:20
in Wyoming and I did another project that was constructing the elements
25:25
of a model for rainfall runoff.
25:28
I was very interested in geomorphology early on and so he was quite
25:33
influential in that respect in terms of nurturing that interest of mine.
25:37
Then when I got to Stanford, the people who impacted me most were probably
25:45
two, no really three, one of whom was my advisor, Bernard Hallet, and he
25:50
was a glacial geologist himself, but was a very mechanics-oriented glacial
25:55
geologist and again really nurtured that interest in applying mathematics
25:59
and mechanics to geologic processes.
26:03
I also took courses from Arvid Johnson, who was on the faculty at Stanford at that
26:07
time and who was very mechanics focused.
26:11
His whole approach to research is that you pursue problems as a problem
26:16
of mechanics and that really made an imprint on me, even though I felt that
26:22
I was not very good at it at that time.
26:24
It took me some years to develop the facility to do the
26:29
kind of work I ended up doing.
26:32
The other person who was really important, more from a purely nurturing standpoint,
26:37
was the chairman of our department, Irwin Remson, who was a hydrogeologist.
26:41
My first two years in graduate school I was a TA all year long
26:45
for Irwin's undergraduate classes which were a series of classes
26:49
called Environmental Earth Sciences.
26:53
The great thing about Irwin, and this wasn't true just in my case,
26:56
it was true with nearly all of the graduate students, is the degree to
27:00
which he inspired our self-confidence and our belief in ourselves.
27:05
He would give us so much
27:09
latitude to do our TAing and so forth in the way that we felt was best
27:14
rather than simply telling us this is what you do, you follow my model.
27:20
Which a lot of professors do.
27:22
A lot of them are a little dictatorial.
27:23
Yeah,
27:26
I can't overstress the importance of the extent to which Irwin
27:30
inspired confidence in his students.
27:34
Even though he wasn't my direct line supervisor, to some degree
27:38
he was a surrogate supervisor.
27:42
Dick, just
27:47
continue along that track please.
27:49
Anyway, I was talking about some of the graduate school faculty at Stanford
27:54
who had a big influence on me, and I named Bernard Hallet, Arvid Johnson,
27:59
and Irwin Remson who were all in my department which was the Department
28:03
of Applied Earth Sciences, which is a department--they've morphed their
28:08
departments at Stanford since that time, so there's no longer a department
28:11
that has that name attached to it.
28:14
But
28:16
the other faculty who most influenced me while I was in graduate school
28:20
were actually in various departments within the school of engineering.
28:25
I took lots of engineering classes, both in mechanics and in applied
28:31
mathematics and that's really where I learned how to apply math
28:36
to real-world physical problems.
28:40
As an undergraduate I had this training in mathematics and physics, but again
28:45
it was at a highly abstract level.
28:47
It was difficult to relate it to real-world phenomena.
28:50
It was by taking all those engineering courses that it really
28:55
helped me develop that facility.
28:57
Some of those faculty were really terrific.
28:59
They were just world-class applied mathematicians and
29:04
excellent teachers as well.
29:06
There was a fella named Andy Acrivos, who left a big impression
29:11
on me, and several others.
29:14
Bob Street was another one.
29:17
You told me that you also became exposed to the USGS at that time.
29:22
Right.
29:22
Because of its proximity but also because of some other reason or
29:26
a faculty or you met somebody?
29:28
How did that connection start?
29:30
Sure, so my connection with the USGS in any formal sense had an interesting start
29:37
to it in that while I was in graduate school I took a lot of coursework in
29:44
all these different departments and that's why I wound up just sort of
29:47
through happenstance getting two masters degrees on the way to getting my Ph.D.,
29:51
but as I was embarking on my last few years of graduate school towards my
29:56
Ph.D. I had written a proposal with a professor in the Civil Engineering
30:02
Department, Joe Franzini, that was going to provide funding for my Ph.D. work.
30:07
This was in 1980, I guess, that we wrote the proposal.
30:12
It must have been early 1980, because when Franzini submitted it to NSF he
30:19
received very encouraging reviews, basically saying we have to go through the
30:25
formalities of the process, but you can basically expect that this will be funded.
30:28
That's the word he received.
30:31
Well, then, here's where a political connection comes in.
30:34
Of course, 1980 was the year Ronald Reagan was elected.
30:39
Shortly after coming into office, Reagan-I'm not sure exactly how this was
30:45
accomplished, but, in any event, there was a contraction of funding to NSF.
30:52
There were a lot of program managers at NSF who suddenly found themselves
30:56
in a position where they had made promises they couldn't keep because
30:59
they no longer had the funding to keep those promises, and our proposal was
31:02
one of those that fell by the wayside.
31:05
Now this leaves me, we're now into 1981 at this point.
31:09
At this point I'm four years into graduate school, have two master's
31:14
degrees, and no Ph.D. project.
31:17
At that point I went to Irwin Remson, our department chair, who
31:22
had been so helpful over the years, and I asked him for his advice.
31:25
What do I do at this point?
31:27
He suggested that I go over and talk to John Bredehoeft at the USGS.
31:31
John Bredehoeft at that time was the western regional hydrologist, so he was
31:35
kind of at the apex of the management structure of the old water resources
31:41
division of the USGS in the western region and he was a very eminent
31:44
researcher himself, had a long, long track record of very significant
31:50
accomplishment in groundwater hydrology.
31:54
I went to Bredehoeft and basically said what can we figure something out here?
32:00
Is there some way you could fund a Ph.D. project for me?
32:04
It turned out what Bredehoeft was interested in was using landslides as an
32:11
analogy for studying earthquake hydrology.
32:14
He had had a long interest in how distributions of groundwater
32:18
pressure affect earthquakes.
32:20
Landslides,
32:23
of course, are much more accessible.
32:25
You've got slip going on as you might have along an earthquake fault, but
32:28
it's much closer to the ground surface and more accessible system to study.
32:31
I had all the right background to do this because I'd had lots
32:34
of hydrology background, I'd had lots of soil mechanics background.
32:39
But prior to that time, I hadn't really even thought about
32:42
specializing in landslides.
32:44
I was really much more interested in
32:48
fluid flow and sediment transport and sort of those aspects of geomorphology.
32:54
Bredehoeft said, here's what we'll do.
32:58
You go off and write a proposal, bring it back to me in a couple of
33:03
months, and then I'll decide on that basis whether I'm going to fund you.
33:07
I did that.
33:08
I worked really hard on this proposal and brought it back to him.
33:10
It was kind of an informal process, because it was reviewed by a
33:13
committee of one, that being John Bredehoeft, but when he read it, he
33:16
was very pleased and so he funded me.
33:20
At that point,
33:24
he endowed me with a very exceptional opportunity for
33:31
a graduate student in that what I had was funding that not only paid
33:36
me a salary, a half-time USGS salary, but I also had, it was something
33:43
on the order of $30,000 a year of operating expenses for my research.
33:52
So, you had a budget and a salary.
33:53
I had a budget and a salary.
33:56
You were living the dream for a grad student!
33:58
And I also had already, my tuition at Stanford was already all paid off
34:02
because I had done all these years of assistantships and so forth.
34:05
I had all that behind me and so now I'm in this position of having a real job.
34:12
To write your dissertation, basically.
34:13
Yeah.
34:13
Basically, that was my job: to do the research and write my dissertation.
34:17
I actually had enough money I was able to pay an assistant to help me.
34:22
I just paid out of my pocket, paid cash out of my pocket out
34:25
of this $30,000 I was getting.
34:27
It
34:31
just worked great.
34:32
The other part that was serendipitous about it is that: what the focus of
34:38
my Ph.D. work was studying a big, slow-moving landslide in northern
34:41
California in Humboldt County just outside of Redwood National Park.
34:44
And this is a landslide where-
34:46
Where is it specifically, exactly?
34:49
Well, it's called Minor Creek Landslide and so it's upstream along Redwood
34:53
Creek, probably 15-20 miles as the creek flows, inland from the Pacific.
35:01
North or south of Arcata?
35:03
North of Arcata, but mainly east of Arcata.
35:07
Okay.
35:12
Anyway, this landslide was a site where the USGS had initiated studies in the
35:17
early 1970s and that was part of the Forest Geomorphology Project that was
35:22
initiated by Dick Janda, who was another person who became instrumental in my
35:26
career because he later was my boss at the Cascades Volcano Observatory.
35:33
But Dick, along with a couple of other able assistants-Mike Nolan and Debbie
35:39
Harden-had started this intensive geomorphic monitoring program in
35:44
the Redwood Creek Drainage Basin and that was something in response to a
35:49
need at the National Park Service.
35:51
The situation in Redwood National Park at that time was they had created
35:55
this park in the 1960s, however much of the watershed had been severely
36:00
impacted by intensive logging.
36:02
They were wanting to expand it [the Park] at that time.
36:04
They were thinking about expanding it, exactly.
36:06
Correct.
36:07
The question was to what degree was this legacy of logging and other kinds
36:14
of land use impacting the resources both within the existing park and also
36:19
within that potential expansion boundary?
36:22
There was no understanding of it.
36:26
This project was created which became collaborative with the
36:30
National Park Service to monitor all these sediment sources.
36:35
One type of sediment source was these big, slow-moving landslides.
36:40
This was one of several that they had instrumented back in the early 1970s.
36:45
When I came on board in the 1980s-
36:48
These were ones where you have the old stake arrays, and you
36:52
measure how much they move.
36:54
Exactly.
36:55
Right.
36:55
That was the most basic instrumentation: you pound hundreds of stakes into
36:58
the landslide and survey it with an old-fashioned theodolite and see
37:02
how fast it's moving and so forth.
37:04
Then, in addition, have other instrumentation: rain gauges-
37:06
Of course, there was slumping and moving [ground] because a lot of
37:09
the trees and the root structure of the top slope had been lost, or no?
37:12
Well, not at Minor Creek and not at many other sites, because these were sites
37:17
that are actually mainly grasslands with only small copses of trees here and
37:23
there, which is an interesting ecological question because I know people have
37:27
puzzled over why should these grasslands exist in a place that gets 2 meters of
37:31
rain a year in this very mild climate.
37:35
It's been speculated and to my knowledge it's still speculation rather than fact.
37:40
It's been speculated that Native Americans actually created these
37:43
grasslands by intentional burns because they realized that the grasslands were
37:48
going to provide a greater diversity of habitat and probably improve their
37:52
hunting opportunities and so forth.
37:54
But I'm not sure that anybody knows the answer to that.
37:57
At least I don't know the answer to that.
37:57
Well, it's basically what's true up here in the Willamette Valley where everybody
38:02
in Eugene and other places up here think they understand environmental history
38:06
that you can't cut any trees down.
38:08
Well, if you look at pictures back at the early settlement there
38:12
wasn't a lot of trees around.
38:12
No trees, yeah.
38:14
It wasn't just because people were clearing them for farms, it's because
38:17
the Natives had done systematic burning for whatever reasons or just
38:22
natural fires had been allowed to burn.
38:23
Anyway,
38:27
certainly some of the areas up there that they were monitoring
38:29
along Redwood Creek were severely impacted by logging and so forth,
38:33
but not the site that I was studying.
38:34
In fact, it's one of the reasons I chose that site is that it was in a relatively
38:38
pristine setting that really its only manipulation by humans was that there was
38:47
a gravel road that crossed it at one spot.
38:49
Other than that, it was in a pretty pristine state.
38:52
It had been monitored to a degree for 10 years and basically what I did in
38:57
the early 1980s was install a great deal more instrumentation, spent an entire
39:01
summer there drilling holes, taking samples, installing instrumentation
39:06
and so forth and then collected a few years of data and that became
39:10
the empirical part of my Ph.D. work.
39:15
That's all yours so...
39:16
Alright, yeah.
39:19
Sure.
39:20
Anyway, I pursued this Ph.D. project that was two-pronged.
39:27
Part of it was monitoring this big, slow-moving landslide in Humboldt
39:30
County and then part of it was developing a theoretical model to try
39:34
to explain how the landslide moved.
39:36
That
39:38
was my first serious attempt at really using relatively sophisticated
39:43
math and mechanics to try to understand something geologically.
39:47
An actual applied, real-life situation?
39:49
To apply to a real-life situation and it worked out well.
39:55
Got my degree and the USGS was sufficiently pleased with it.
40:00
John Bredehoeft would have been my boss at the USGS and offered me a permanent
40:05
job at the USGS when I graduated.
40:08
I would have to go through the formalities of course, but I at the time was
40:12
really thinking that I wanted to teach.
40:14
So, you were kind of like your brother and your sister?
40:16
You were in that mode of well I'm going to do an academic career?
40:19
Exactly.
40:19
I really thought I was going to pursue an academic career and of course that's the
40:24
nature of the academic job cycle that good jobs appear somewhat infrequently and in
40:32
unexpected times and places and so forth.
40:35
It happened that the year I graduated in 1984 that the most attractive
40:42
academic job that was available was at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
40:49
I applied for that job and I was offered that job.
40:53
It was really the only job that was of interest to me among the academic jobs.
40:56
This was in '83, '84?
40:57
This was '84.
40:59
'84, okay.
41:02
So, I had this tough decision to make: was I going to go to work for the
41:04
USGS or was I going to go to Madison?
41:09
Frankly what decided it, again is that it all came back to geography.
41:13
Although Madison is a wonderful city, if you're going to live in the
41:17
Midwest, there's probably not too many better places to live than Madison.
41:21
However, by that time I felt so rooted in the mountain west that it was
41:28
difficult for me to think about leaving that and going back to the Midwest.
41:32
You were spoiled by big topography.
41:34
I was spoiled by big topography.
41:36
And also, the kind of research I did.
41:37
At that point I've now got quite an investment in studying landslides.
41:44
Of course, the only landslides they have in Wisconsin are along the bluffs
41:49
adjacent to Lake Michigan, which is pretty small potatoes compared to around here.
41:57
Mount St. Helens just a few years previously had produced
41:59
the world's largest landslide in historic times off the north flank
42:03
of Mount St. Helens, 2.5 km3.
42:07
There was all this great geological stuff going on here and much less
42:11
so in Wisconsin or in the Midwest.
42:15
I guess at that point I was also aware of the fact that, if I was going to come
42:19
to work for the USGS, it would be up at the Cascades Volcano Observatory [CVO].
42:23
The reason was at that time the USGS had a hiring freeze in
42:28
place, an absolute hiring freeze.
42:30
This was the Reagan era.
42:31
This was the Reagan era.
42:34
There was one exemption to that hiring freeze and that was related to Mount St.
42:38
Helens because Mount St. Helens, people sometimes forget that it had the big
42:42
eruption in 1980 but then it continued to erupt intermittently until 1986.
42:47
It was still very much an active volcano.
42:49
It was perceived to be a significant public threat.
42:52
So,
42:54
CVO-focusing on Mount St. Helens--had an exemption for the hiring freeze
42:58
based on a public safety basis.
43:02
They said we can hire you but that's where it's going to be.
43:05
That seemed not so bad.
43:06
It was sort of a twist of circumstance that led me to wind up at
43:15
CVO.
43:16
In 1980 when the big blow happened, you obviously remembered that.
43:22
Did you go up shortly thereafter as a curiosity, not even in a formal study way?
43:28
No.
43:28
I didn't.
43:28
But what I do really regret is that that first trip that I
43:31
made to the Pacific Northwest, which was in the summer of 1978-
43:35
The one you told me about that I wanted to elaborate on
43:37
further, not, like, right now?
43:39
Exactly.
43:40
On that trip we drove up through northern California and as I recall did not spend a
43:46
great deal of time in northern California.
43:48
We were really bound for the Pacific Northwest proper.
43:51
Spent some time camping in the Three Sisters area, here in Oregon.
43:56
Continued on past Mt. Hood and I remember being very impressed with Mt. Hood, which
44:00
is-I remember one view in particular of Mt. Hood from the north side that
44:06
is very much the view I'm going to have from my property where I plan to move
44:11
when I retire, outside of Hood River.
44:13
I was just going to say in Hood River Valley there somewhere?
44:15
Yeah.
44:16
So, I remember that.
44:17
And then I also remember that from there we preceded straight to Mt. Rainier
44:22
and went right past Mount St. Helens.
44:25
I really wish-
44:26
That you'd seen it before, right?
44:27
-that I'd had that perspective of visiting and spending some time
44:32
around Mount St. Helens prior to the eruption, because I still have
44:35
colleagues who did have that experience.
44:37
They're mostly older than me and sort of getting on in years at this point,
44:43
but boy I wish I had their experience.
44:45
A few of them even climbed the mountain prior to 1980 and I wish I had had that
44:50
experience because it obviously was a place that was extremely different than
44:55
the way it is today and very special to people in its beauty and so forth.
44:59
Like Jerry Franklin who became very involved with the ecology, he used to go
45:03
camping around that whole area and he even did some early studies in the area and
45:10
you kind of have that mythic perfect symmetrical cone, I call
45:14
it the "Cotopaxi of the North."
45:15
Yeah.
45:15
You know what I'm saying?
45:17
Oh, it was a beautiful mountain.
45:18
Those views from Spirit Lake, for example, that we now see only in
45:21
photos and paintings and so forth.
45:23
I wish I could have experienced that.
45:27
My first memory of Mount St. Helens was seeing it after the eruption
45:30
from the air, and this was,
45:35
I guess it was before I actually started working at CVO, but I had come up to visit
45:39
as a kind of recruitment trip or something of that nature and I was able to take a
45:44
helicopter flight around the mountain.
45:46
But this was in 1984, so four years after the eruption.
45:52
Frankly, I think any time you experience something from the air and haven't
45:57
been down on the ground it's difficult to appreciate the real scope of it.
46:03
It was very impressive flying around and seeing all this stuff from a helicopter
46:07
and so forth, but it really wasn't until later that I started work there and spent
46:11
time on the ground that it began to sink into my kind of psyche what a profound
46:17
event this was and what the scope of it was and the scale involved and so forth.
46:28
Just going back-did you travel anywhere else to see some of the other landslides
46:34
and volcanic eruptions that you mentioned?
46:36
Like Columbia happened in '82, right?
46:39
Well, you're thinking of Nevado del Ruiz.
46:40
Yes.
46:40
In 1985.
46:40
'85! Excuse me.
46:40
Yeah.
46:40
No,
46:44
I actually did not
46:48
participate in that Nevado del Ruiz response, although
46:51
several of my colleagues did.
46:54
I'm trying to remember-there was a particular reason.
46:56
There was something going on.
46:58
That was in the fall of 1985.
47:00
The eruption occurred in November and the USGS response began right
47:06
around the first of December.
47:10
I honestly don't recollect what my conflict was, but given that was early
47:15
December I would not be surprised if it somehow had to do with the upcoming AGU
47:21
[American Geophysical Union] meeting.
47:22
I think what it was I had organized a session, a technical session that was
47:28
going to take place at this AGU meeting.
47:31
I felt that I needed to be there.
47:33
I was supposed to be there to chair this session and I thought well if I go off
47:37
to Columbia now, I'm not going to get back in time for that and I'm going to be
47:42
not following up on my commitment here.
47:46
Retrospectively, it would have been, I certainly would have learned a lot more by
47:52
going to Columbia than at the AGU meeting.
47:56
Have you ever been to that site?
47:56
No, I've never been there.
48:00
Speaking of something I mentioned after your talk last night,
48:02
have you ever been to Huascaran?
48:04
Never been to Huascaran, either.
48:06
I highly recommend it.
48:09
Number one it's the Cordillera
48:13
Blanca and from a glaciology perspective and climate change is interesting too.
48:15
But it's a spiritually impactful experience because the park that's been
48:20
created where a young guy once was is a giant rose garden about 2 miles long.
48:25
There's a birthday cake like spiral staircase thing around basically a shrine
48:31
with a Christ figure on top at the end of it with Yungay right there and so you
48:36
realize there's 20,000 people below you that were buried and never excavated.
48:42
I'm just saying it's a powerful experience.
48:45
That would be a powerful experience.
48:47
I would like to visit there and for me it elicits thoughts of analogies
48:51
with the Oso landslide three and a half years ago in Washington state.
48:54
I was going to ask you about that later on about applied geology
48:57
and preventing human loss of life.
49:00
For me I was one of the first-my colleague, Jonathan Godt and I,
49:05
were the first two geologists on the ground there at the Oso site.
49:09
So, we're going to-okay, we're going to-go on about the Oso.
49:11
Well what I was going to say is that
49:16
hearing about the memorial at Yungay, and then there's a similar memorial
49:20
at the site of the Madison Canyon rock avalanche that occurred just outside
49:25
of Yellowstone National Park in 1959.
49:27
The Hebgen Lake earthquake triggered this rockslide and it buried a campground
49:32
where there were something like 30 people camped who were all entombed and what
49:39
they did at that site was much like you're describing, albeit on a smaller scale.
49:42
There's a very tastefully done interpretive center and memorial
49:45
there to list the names of all the victims and so forth.
49:48
To me that seems like the right response.
49:52
In contrast, at Oso, it was a horrific scene.
49:56
It was really-it impacted me tremendously, emotionally.
50:00
And you went out there shortly after, did you?
50:01
Yeah.
50:01
You were pretty close, right?
50:04
I was right in amongst the recovery workers who were slogging through
50:09
the quicksand and digging out bodies and body parts and everywhere you
50:14
looked there's evidence of humanity.
50:18
Some things are just heartbreaking, like a teddy bear sitting over
50:22
here and a children's shoes over there... just a chaos.
50:28
Like when you see a tornadic disaster like John Flynn or something
50:31
like, the same kind of thing.
50:32
What it reminded me of being from the Midwest of course and seeing tornado
50:36
debris before, what it looked like is that it had been struck by a tornado
50:41
just blasting everything to smithereens and then you poured quicksand on top
50:45
of the whole thing to turn it into this kind of nightmarish quagmire.
50:48
Because the whole thing liquified, didn't it?
50:49
Well, at least the distal part of it was liquified and very fluid
50:53
and moving very fast and deep, which is why it was so destructive.
50:58
But what happened at Oso, instead of there being something like a tasteful memorial,
51:04
there is now a type of memorial there, but it was constructed just kind of by local
51:10
citizens is my understanding without any real government assistance or oversight.
51:17
Instead shortly after the event the governor made the proclamation that
51:21
we're going to recover everybody.
51:24
We're going to recover everybody out of this deposit.
51:27
That's a lot of digging.
51:28
Well, 8 million cubic meters of debris.
51:31
To dig out everybody?
51:33
Well, eventually in a sense.
51:36
But basically, he made the statement that we will keep searching and we
51:42
won't let anything else happen there in terms of rebuilding the road and so
51:48
forth until we've recovered everybody.
51:51
Well, after several months had gone by, they still hadn't recovered everybody.
51:56
They recovered almost everybody but there were still a few people missing.
52:00
Wasn't it like 60 or 70 or 50?
52:01
No, it was 43.
52:03
Okay, right.
52:04
Which actually made it the most lethal landslide in U.S. history
52:08
with one exception, and that was an event that occurred in Puerto Rico.
52:13
Of course, Puerto Rico in some sense is technically part of the United States.
52:17
Although the Hurricane Maria victims might differ.
52:19
They may not feel that way right now.
52:22
But the thing that surprised me about Maria was that there weren't
52:26
more catastrophic landslides of major loss of human life.
52:31
Weren't you a little surprised?
52:32
Well, there were lots of landslides is my understanding, but the fact that there
52:36
wasn't an order of magnitude greater loss of life there is astonishing to me.
52:42
Cat 5 drilled right through the island.
52:44
It was amazing to me.
52:45
I thought there'd be thousands.
52:46
Yeah, I thought so too.
52:48
I did and I'm grateful.
52:49
I've got friends and colleague and family friends down there, so yeah very grateful.
52:55
Anyway, what was done at Oso was very different.
52:58
They did a great deal of excavation trying to recover bodies and then there
53:05
was this whole barrage of lawsuits, which are still not completely resolved.
53:10
I thought they had been resolved, but my understanding is that now
53:13
there's a second batch of lawsuits.
53:16
They're basically trying to pin blame on somebody for this event.
53:20
Planners or zoning or what have you, right?
53:23
Right-or trying to implicate logging, which
53:31
in a circumstance like this is simply unknowable as to whether
53:35
logging could have had any influence.
53:36
It's more conspicuous when you have shallow, rapid landslides that are
53:42
actually within the root zone of the soil.
53:44
This thing was 100 ft thick.
53:46
It was way, way below the root zone of trees, so who knows.
53:52
But the whole thing has been, including the science, the whole Oso response has
53:59
been greatly complicated by the fact that there had been all these ongoing lawsuits.
54:06
I'm going to return to this subject and the dynamic in your science and
54:11
how it applies to human societies, because I anticipate that some of
54:17
the reason you went into what became your thing was to prevent or at least
54:24
have better predictive mechanisms.
54:25
Absolutely.
54:27
Then you have human hubris and forgetfulness and what have you.
54:33
I will ask you that a little bit later after we get into the debris-flow flume,
54:36
which is going to be very soon, here.
54:37
Sure.
54:38
Okay, so
54:42
now do you think that some of your interest in developing something to study,
54:48
debris flows, of course the debris-flow flume up at the H.J. Andrews Experimental
54:52
Forest became your signature thing that you did in that area, do you think
54:58
that was maybe partly motivated by when you got up to the volcano observatory?
55:02
You were doing work in the aftermath of the big eruption, there were still small
55:07
processes going on comparatively, had to do with well I wasn't here for this.
55:13
I want to develop some way to look at processes in real time
55:18
because I wasn't here for this.
55:20
Well, absolutely.
55:23
In large part we built a flume simply because it's so difficult to study
55:27
these things in a natural setting.
55:29
After arriving at CVO my colleague Rick LaHusen and I had spent a lot of time
55:35
and effort instrumenting two different sites around Mount St. Helens trying
55:40
to capture good quality real-time data on debris flows or landslides as they
55:45
happened, and the short version of that story is that it was a failure.
55:51
We didn't succeed in either case.
55:53
Because nothing really happened, correct?
55:54
Well, in the case of one of these sites we had instrumented this channel
55:59
right at the mouth of the crater of Mount St. Helens, a place called Loowit
56:02
Channel which had frequent debris flows, but the next one that came down was
56:07
far bigger than the preceding dozen and just took everything with it,
56:11
removed all of our instrumentation.
56:14
All this hard work went for naught.
56:15
Of course, in the original debris flow it wouldn't have mattered
56:19
how big your instrument...
56:20
It wouldn't have mattered, yeah.
56:21
I mean you go down into that debris flow and you see these chunks.
56:26
It's stunning really.
56:27
Oh yeah.
56:27
I know.
56:28
So, it's fraught with problems.
56:32
Any time you're trying to measure something in the field that happens
56:36
infrequently and where it's difficult to anticipate the magnitude your chances
56:42
of success are pretty small, really.
56:45
There has to be a lot of luck on your side to be successful.
56:48
It became clear to me that the way to study this more efficiently
56:53
was experimentally rather than through field data acquisition.
56:57
Just like going back to the Midwest, another disturbance tornados.
57:02
Sure.
57:02
They're so unpredictable, even with present-day modeling
57:06
and satellite imagery.
57:08
Getting instrumentation in a position to where it can somehow
57:13
read the inner part of the vortex or whatever without getting you killed.
57:17
Yeah.
57:17
That stupid movie, Twister.
57:19
You probably saw it.
57:22
Sure.
57:22
As a consequence, they still don't really understand tornados.
57:25
It's just so difficult to acquire the data you need.
57:30
Anyway,
57:34
you were talking about Mount St. Helens and you arrived in 1983, three
57:39
years after the big 1980 eruption, when the studies of geologic and
57:43
ecologic processes in the post-eruption landscape were in full swing.
57:48
How did the Mount St. Helens process in its early years affect your
57:52
professional development as a catalyst for new direction or compelling subject
57:57
and example of natural processes and disturbance that may have fed an existing
58:01
interest that was already starting all the different things you studied at Stanford
58:04
and maybe with your early USGS work?
58:08
I would say the biggest influence of my experience at Mount St. Helens had to
58:14
do with the fact that whereas I had been studying slow-moving landslides, things
58:19
that move persistently but never more than a few meters a year typically, at
58:24
Mount St. Helens things routinely happened fast and there were dramatic changes.
58:29
Of course, the most dramatic of all being May 18, 1980: the huge landslide
58:33
and eruption and lahars and so forth, but even subsequent to that there were
58:37
ongoing on a nearly weekly basis in the wintertime significant events: debris
58:44
flows and so forth happening, tremendous changes happening along the Toutle
58:49
River in terms of the development of the drainage system and that in turn
58:52
was influenced by lots of landslides feeding sediment into the river.
58:57
You could see things unfolding sort of before your eyes at a pace that's sort
59:03
of atypical geologically in most cases.
59:10
Keep going?
59:15
I think for one thing it caused me to refocus my attention more
59:21
on fast-moving kinds of landslides and debris flows and so forth,
59:25
rather than these slow-moving ones.
59:28
Of course, it was also clear that that was really the issue.
59:30
That was much more significant from the standpoint of hazard assessment
59:34
and public safety and so on.
59:38
Very early on you saw an applied scientific reason for doing
59:45
what you wanted to do and-
59:46
Absolutely.
59:47
It had something to do with human society?
59:53
Yeah, frankly applications were on my mind from the very beginning, even when I was
59:58
an undergraduate student studying geology.
1:00:01
It was part of the reason that the part of geology that interested me
1:00:04
most was that part dealing with the current landscape and current processes
1:00:09
and how does movement of water and sediment influence ecology, influence
1:00:17
humankind, how, in turn, can humankind change those processes and so forth?
1:00:24
That was always very much on my radar screen as something that
1:00:27
I wanted to focus on rather than purely abstract scientific questions.
1:00:32
It seemed so important to me to try to apply the science as something
1:00:39
that was societally relevant.
1:00:41
Now,
1:00:44
what were some of the central assumptions you may have had, general or specific
1:00:48
axioms and paradigms, about debris flows, earth processes in general, about
1:00:53
ecological or geologic processes regarding major disturbance events, volcanic
1:00:59
eruptions in particular-how were they challenged, supported, or overturned by
1:01:04
what you saw at Mount St. Helens, other volcanos, and everything that happened
1:01:08
after you got up to Vancouver and after.
1:01:13
I would say, I'm just trying to think if there were any paradigms
1:01:19
that were really overturned in my mind as a result of what
1:01:23
I saw at Mount St. Helens.
1:01:28
Frankly, there's nothing that occurs to me that's very specific.
1:01:32
My understanding is that Mount St. Helens really did overturn a number of
1:01:38
paradigms from an ecological perspective-
1:01:41
About regeneration.
1:01:42
About regeneration, because it was certainly the impression that
1:01:45
most everyone had that there was a hundred percent annihilation,
1:01:50
within certainly the close-end part of the blast zone and even for-
1:01:54
Because the scorch was so hot it just fried every biological thing, right?
1:01:57
Absolutely.
1:01:58
I guess I was among those who was really surprised by the
1:02:03
speed of the ecological response.
1:02:06
Places on the debris avalanche that within several years not only had
1:02:10
young trees growing up, but amphibians had moved in, there were these whole
1:02:14
communities of plants and animals.
1:02:16
That was very obvious if you spent time walking around on the debris avalanche.
1:02:23
That was significant.
1:02:24
In terms of the geology, I think kind of the overturn of paradigms occurred more
1:02:32
during the eruption itself because St. Helens really did open people's eyes in
1:02:38
a very significant way to the role that huge landslides can play in sculpting
1:02:45
volcanos and influencing the types of eruptions that occur and so forth.
1:02:50
There had actually been an analogous event that had occurred
1:02:54
at a very remote location: Bezymianny Volcano on the Kamchatka
1:02:58
Peninsula of Siberia in the 1950s.
1:03:01
There had been a flank collapse that had led to a lateral blast,
1:03:05
really a close analogy to Mount.
1:03:06
St. Helens.
1:03:07
This area was so remote that it was largely unknown to western scientists.
1:03:13
Nobody lives close by.
1:03:14
Nobody lives there and whatever had been published was published
1:03:17
in Russian and very few Americans-
1:03:19
Did they have any science people that were close enough to be
1:03:21
there when the eruption happened?
1:03:22
To my knowledge, no.
1:03:24
Subsequent to that eruption-
1:03:25
Because that's a really remote peninsula.
1:03:27
Subsequent to that eruption the Soviets did establish a volcanology outpost there.
1:03:34
It exists to this day that there is a science presence, but I think prior to the
1:03:37
eruption there was no science presence.
1:03:39
Is that the big 15,000 ft volcano that's there, or is that a different one?
1:03:42
Well, there's a whole series of volcanoes on the peninsula and I'm
1:03:45
not sure how Bezymianny stacks up.
1:03:46
Well, there's one that's really big.
1:03:47
It's like 15,700 [ft] or something.
1:03:49
I don't think that's Bezymianny.
1:03:50
It's a different one, but those volcanoes in Kamchatka, you
1:03:55
know look a lot like say the
1:04:00
volcanoes on the Aleutian peninsula in Alaska.
1:04:03
Like Katmai and all that.
1:04:05
Very similar kind of setting.
1:04:07
So,
1:04:10
it was mainly about
1:04:14
the dynamics of debris flows and landslides that St. Helens educated,
1:04:19
challenged, gave a profound example of?
1:04:23
Absolutely.
1:04:24
Okay.
1:04:27
Now, you're there in the '80s, the Columbia Volcano happens.
1:04:33
How would you contrast and compare St. Helens with
1:04:38
Nevado del Ruiz?
1:04:40
The St. Helens eruption and landslide and lahars was a very different
1:04:45
kind of event, actually, than what happened at Nevado del Ruiz.
1:04:49
At St. Helens, of course, there was this immense landslide, 2.5 km3, that
1:04:54
removed the flank of the mountain, triggering this huge, explosive eruption.
1:04:58
The big part of the story there was not only the landslide and lahars but also
1:05:03
the immense lateral blast that leveled, what was it, 230 km2 or something
1:05:08
like that, a huge devastated area.
1:05:10
At Ruiz, in contrast, Ruiz is a very large volcano.
1:05:14
As I recall, it's about 18,000 ft. high, ice clad.
1:05:18
Even though it's near the equator, it has a substantial
1:05:21
ice cap on it at that altitude.
1:05:24
The eruption at Ruiz was actually kind of a piddling little eruption.
1:05:28
The explosive component and so forth, and even though pyroclastic flows were
1:05:36
too small to be of much consequence in terms of public safety, but what
1:05:40
happened at Ruiz is that these hot flows that issued out of the summit vent-
1:05:44
The lahars, right?
1:05:45
Well, they didn't start out as lahars.
1:05:47
Oh, okay.
1:05:48
They started out as dense, pyroclastic flows.
1:05:52
At least this is my recollection and scoured and entrained a
1:05:56
great deal of snow and ice.
1:05:58
Of course, because they were hot, they were very effective
1:06:00
at melting that snow and ice.
1:06:03
Ruiz is kind of a broad summit, a broad-capped volcano, shaped
1:06:07
kind of reminiscent of Mt. Rainier with that broad summit.
1:06:11
There's always activity going on near the summit of entraining
1:06:14
snow and ice and so forth.
1:06:15
Then these flows kind of drop off the top of the mountain and into
1:06:23
a topography of very high relief, very steep canyons and so forth.
1:06:27
It's also tropical, too.
1:06:28
Also, tropical.
1:06:29
Wet sediment down there.
1:06:31
These things now have transformed into lahars up near the summit, but now they
1:06:36
enter these canyons and grow enormously in size by scouring material, causing slope
1:06:41
failures and so forth along their path.
1:06:44
By the time they reach populated areas some 10s of km
1:06:47
downstream, now they're big.
1:06:50
That was really what resulted in the devastating lahars.
1:06:53
It was a case there of minor eruptive activity causing very devastating lahars.
1:07:00
That was a paradigm changer I think for many of us.
1:07:04
How so, exactly?
1:07:05
It made us realize it doesn't take much of an eruption to wreak havoc farther
1:07:10
downstream in the right circumstances, and we have some very analogous circumstances
1:07:16
here in the Pacific northwest, Mt. Rainier being a good example.
1:07:18
The Nisqually River, right?
1:07:20
The Nisqually drainage, the Puyallup drainage, those two being the key
1:07:24
drainages of Mt. Rainier that are most vulnerable to these sorts of things.
1:07:28
Mt. Baker to some degree is the same way.
1:07:31
What would be the danger of Mt. Baker?
1:07:33
It's so heavily ice-capped, too.
1:07:36
The danger there again would be that a relatively modest eruption could end
1:07:39
up producing sizeable lahars through melting and entrainment of snow and ice.
1:07:43
There, you don't' have population living so close to the volcano but
1:07:48
there are substantial reservoirs.
1:07:51
Of course, a big flow entering a reservoir could potentially not only overtop the dam
1:07:58
but could actually cause the dam to fail.
1:08:00
Are they earth-flow dams, those?
1:08:03
I believe that the critical dams, I'm not certain, because I've
1:08:06
actually never visited those dams, but I think they're concrete dams.
1:08:11
Of course, that could be a colossal disaster then downstream
1:08:14
in which you have a dam failure.
1:08:16
I'm just thinking of the model that you had in your talk last
1:08:19
night about earthflow dams and rivulets becoming bigger.
1:08:25
Yeah, right.
1:08:25
Exactly, so that could happen, too.
1:08:27
If it's an earthen dam it could be this progressive enlargement of the breach.
1:08:30
Wasn't the one down in California that they had to evacuate all the people out.
1:08:34
That was a big earth-fill dam, right?
1:08:36
The one Oroville, right?
1:08:37
Yeah.
1:08:38
It had sort of a concrete face on it, but it was basically an earth-fill dam.
1:08:43
Right, 700 ft high.
1:08:45
Highest earth-filled dam in the country.
1:08:47
I never realized it was that big.
1:08:49
That was a very scary situation.
1:08:51
I thought it was going to get out of control, but we were lucky.
1:08:56
Anyway, you're at Mount St. Helens.
1:08:59
Tell me about the events and the processes that led for you to
1:09:03
realize that you wanted to do something like this debris flow.
1:09:06
I believe that there was one other in the world that existed.
1:09:11
No, there was really no other [debris-flow] flume-man, to this
1:09:13
day there's really no other.
1:09:14
Even the one in Japan that you mention in your talk?
1:09:16
That's a different kind of facility.
1:09:18
The facility in Japan is very impressive.
1:09:21
It's a different kind of facility.
1:09:23
It's well-equipped for studying the onset of landslides, but it is
1:09:29
not constructed in such a way that allows you to study the downslope
1:09:35
runout process.
1:09:36
Because they stop it before it-
1:09:37
They stop it at the foot of the slope and the story is over.
1:09:38
And it's not that high anyway, is it?
1:09:40
No, it's not that high.
1:09:41
It looked like it was about 30 ft high, maybe, 40 ft. high?
1:09:43
Something like that, yeah.
1:09:47
That, however, that experience of participating in those large-scale
1:09:51
experiments in Japan was a seminal event for me in terms of kind of catalyzing
1:09:59
thinking about how we could build our own large-scale experimental facility.
1:10:08
I probably wouldn't have conceived of doing that had it not been
1:10:10
for that experience in Japan.
1:10:12
So, it gave you a visual model of sorts.
1:10:15
Exactly.
1:10:15
And you said, okay.
1:10:17
But then you said we want something bigger that can do more.
1:10:20
Yeah, bigger or different, focusing more on the flow dynamics rather
1:10:24
than just the initiation process.
1:10:29
How did that process hatch, ferment, go from idea to conception?
1:10:36
Take me through that.
1:10:37
Well, the notion that we should try to do experiments, I guess, became clear to me
1:10:44
quite early on as we were trying to make these field measurements of debris flows,
1:10:48
and they weren't terribly successful.
1:10:49
The ones like at St. Helens you were talking about.
1:10:50
At Mount St. Helens.
1:10:51
Because you couldn't catch lightening in a bottle, so to speak.
1:10:52
You couldn't catch lightening in a bottle.
1:10:58
It seemed like studying them in a controlled environment
1:11:01
was going to make sense.
1:11:03
It also seemed to me that it needed to be done at quite a large scale,
1:11:08
simply because I was already aware at that time through doing simple
1:11:11
calculations that there were going to be real scaling problems if you tried
1:11:15
to do this at miniature benchtop scale.
1:11:17
People had done miniature benchtop experiments with debris flows, and
1:11:21
frankly I think that's what led to some of the false preconceptions
1:11:25
regarding debris flows that existed in the 1980s in terms of what was really
1:11:30
important in controlling their behavior.
1:11:31
Just give me a couple of examples of false assumptions.
1:11:34
Well, the most significant example I think is simply that most people in this
1:11:40
country, and probably worldwide as well regarded this Bingham Model, also known
1:11:47
as the viscoplastic model, as being the best way to represent the underlying
1:11:53
mechanics of how debris flows work.
1:11:57
The gist of that model is that the material is assumed to flow much like
1:12:02
a liquid with the only difference being that it has a finite yield strength,
1:12:05
meaning that it won't start to flow until you put enough of it on a steep-enough
1:12:10
slope until it overcomes this yield strength and then it starts to flow.
1:12:13
But thereafter it basically behaves much like a viscous liquid.
1:12:20
I think that that way of thinking about the problem was biased by
1:12:24
the fact that people had done these small-scale experiments, these benchtop
1:12:27
scale experiments, because when you mix up a batch of mud and run it at
1:12:34
that scale it does behave that way.
1:12:36
It really does sort of act like a viscoplastic material and the
1:12:40
cohesion of the mud provides the dominant resisting force that
1:12:47
regulates the motion of this mass of mud.
1:12:51
However, when you go to a much larger scale the mud starts to play a very
1:12:56
different role, which is that it helps preserve the high pore fluid pressure
1:13:01
that develops within this material.
1:13:04
That high pore fluid pressure is what enables the material to flow fast and far.
1:13:09
That's a matter of mass and scale, correct?
1:13:13
It's a matter of scale.
1:13:15
That effect becomes increasingly important at increasingly larger
1:13:21
scales and it grows in importance faster than the growth in scale.
1:13:26
If I double the size of the flow, the importance of that pore
1:13:32
fluid effect increases more than twofold by doubling this scale.
1:13:39
Based on those kinds of considerations I really felt that the experiments needed
1:13:43
to be done on a large scale but really didn't think about it seriously, didn't
1:13:46
really think about building a facility until I'd seen that facility in Japan
1:13:52
and participated in those experiments and realized what could be done at that scale.
1:13:56
That was in the '80s, correct?
1:13:57
That was in 1987.
1:13:58
I spent several months in Japan.
1:14:01
That made a big difference.
1:14:03
The other thing that you start to appreciate in large scale
1:14:05
experiments like that is that there's actually an economy of scale.
1:14:11
When you scale up far enough you can start using standard
1:14:15
construction equipment as part of your battery of experimental devices.
1:14:22
The unit cost goes way down.
1:14:24
Because now you're buying things at a marketplace that's sold to a million
1:14:28
contractors around the world as opposed to having to fabricate some highly
1:14:33
specialized scientific apparatus that costs 100x as much per unit
1:14:37
utility because it's so specialized.
1:14:39
At our flume we used, we have a backhoe loader that's much like what you'd
1:14:44
see out on some construction site.
1:14:52
By the way, you were in Japan.
1:14:54
When did Unzen Volcano have a big eruption?
1:14:56
Was that in the '80s or in the early '90s?
1:14:58
Unzen-so, well Unzen was in the '90s, but there was another event in Japan.
1:15:08
I'm trying to remember what year it was.
1:15:10
I think in 1984 there was a volcano called Ontake in Japan that had a
1:15:18
minor eruption that was accompanied by a sizeable debris avalanche, sort
1:15:22
of like the Mount St. Helens debris avalanche, although Ontake is a smaller
1:15:25
volcano with a smaller debris avalanche.
1:15:27
But it provided one more piece of important evidence about how
1:15:32
significant these kinds of events can be at volcanos, even when the eruptive
1:15:38
activity itself is relatively modest.
1:15:41
What kind of lessons or even frustrations did your experience, and
1:15:45
your colleagues, up at the volcano observatory in trying to historically
1:15:50
reconstruct processes from the photos, the videos, measurements in the field?
1:15:56
I've seen a lot of that stuff that's been done.
1:15:59
What did you learn positively but also, like, this just
1:16:02
doesn't take us far enough?
1:16:04
That's a good question.
1:16:05
It is true that at St. Helens the eruption of May 18, 1980
1:16:12
was fortuitous in many ways.
1:16:14
It occurred at 8:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning.
1:16:19
It was a clear, spring morning.
1:16:21
As we all know here in the northwest, clear mornings in May
1:16:25
are not to be taken for granted.
1:16:27
I'm sure they're a minority.
1:16:29
The fact that it was a weekend-there were all sorts of amateur photographers
1:16:34
and what not distributed around the mountain, had their cameras set up
1:16:38
because it was a time of day when they were already out for the day.
1:16:40
They were just kind of beginning to putter around their campsite
1:16:42
but they had their cameras set up.
1:16:45
So, we have this remarkable photographic record of what happened, which is
1:16:49
really even today quite extraordinary.
1:16:52
You read Richard Waitt's book.
1:16:53
Oh yeah.
1:16:53
That's pretty cool.
1:16:54
It's a good account of all that.
1:17:01
Despite all that, despite this remarkable body of evidence and
1:17:05
despite the fact that all kinds of detailed scientific measurements
1:17:09
had been made prior to the eruption-
1:17:11
Because there were sensors all over the volcano, right?
1:17:13
Yeah, well to the degree that that was possible.
1:17:15
Back in 1980 it was a different world then, in terms of the world of
1:17:18
sensors and computers and so forth.
1:17:20
But
1:17:23
despite all that there were all these unanswered questions about the dynamics
1:17:27
of the landslide and what allowed it to move so fast and so far, and so forth,
1:17:31
and how did the lahars really get started?
1:17:34
What was it about the landslide that allowed it to partly transform into
1:17:39
lahars that traveled all the way to the Columbia River and that sort of thing?
1:17:44
The great body of evidence answered lots of questions, but it probably posed
1:17:50
as many new questions as it answered.
1:17:54
Because there just wasn't enough ways to calibrate and-?
1:18:00
Exactly.
1:18:02
Fred told me about how the Rosenfeld [Gary Rosenquist] photographs
1:18:05
they were trying to do time-lapse and estimation of distance and
1:18:10
trigonometry and this and that.
1:18:12
That's the thing, the photographs, commonly when you see the photographs
1:18:16
of the beginnings of the eruption, they have these timestamps applied.
1:18:21
But the fact is none of those were actually timestamped photos.
1:18:25
Those timestamps were all applied after the fact through reconstructions and
1:18:29
trying to piece the evidence together.
1:18:31
So, there was a lot of room for error?
1:18:32
There was a lot of room for error.
1:18:34
Anyway, you're in the late '80s and you're thinking about doing this.
1:18:38
How did the process really begin of I want to do this, here's a design model?
1:18:44
How did culminate around in your head and what other collaborators did you have with
1:18:48
you that were helping you conceive this?
1:18:51
The way the process unfolded, it really began in earnest when my colleague,
1:18:56
Rick LaHusen, and I returned from this experience in Japan because he was
1:19:00
with me during that period of several months working on those experiments.
1:19:03
He was up at the volcano observatory?
1:19:04
He's retired now, but yes, we were colleagues for many years at
1:19:09
CVO.
1:19:09
He was an instrumentation specialist.
1:19:12
In fact, I had recruited him to come to work for the Survey
1:19:15
for that particular reason.
1:19:16
He was so good at doing his instrumentation work.
1:19:22
It was after we came back from Japan, frankly probably while we were in
1:19:26
Japan, we started talking about what we need is something kind of like this.
1:19:31
We need a big experimental facility where we can make debris flows and then study
1:19:36
their dynamics as they run out down slope and pick up high speeds and so forth.
1:19:41
Arriving back at CVO, soon thereafter, we started to
1:19:47
start a campaign of lobbying our managers in the USGS.
1:19:52
First of all, just locally, my immediate boss, John Costa, who was
1:19:56
receptive to the idea, and then he in turn floated the idea with higher
1:20:01
levels of management in the USGS.
1:20:03
They were pretty receptive, although there
1:20:07
was a tug of war of sorts.
1:20:10
There were people who were very strongly opposed to investing this kind of money.
1:20:15
Which was a quarter million dollars.
1:20:18
A quarter million dollars, which was more in those days than it is today.
1:20:23
In doing so, on something that was completely different than what had
1:20:26
ever been tried before and in trusting a couple of early 30-somethings,
1:20:32
meaning Rick and me, with this amount of money and responsibility to do
1:20:37
something well and carry it out.
1:20:38
There were those who were quite skeptical.
1:20:40
But fortunately, the people who really mattered, my direct boss
1:20:45
John Costa, and his direct boss, John Conomos, who was in Menlo Park,
1:20:49
California, were both very supportive.
1:20:52
The lobbying process began late in 1987 and by '89 or '90,
1:21:01
I can't remember exactly what year, we'd sort of been given
1:21:06
unofficial authorization to proceed, meaning to start making plans.
1:21:12
The process then was first of all coming up with a sort of sketch level design,
1:21:18
just Rick and I batting ideas back and forth about this is what we want
1:21:22
this thing to look like more or less.
1:21:24
Once we had that image in mind of what we wanted it to look
1:21:27
like, the next big question was where can we possibly do this?
1:21:32
The original sketches are they quite similar to what
1:21:35
actually was finally built?
1:21:36
Yeah.
1:21:38
They're primitive sketches, but in terms of the geometry, the size-
1:21:45
The gradient.
1:21:45
The gradient, yeah, it ended up being pretty similar to
1:21:49
what we originally had in mind.
1:21:52
There were some fortunate circumstances in that as well,
1:21:55
which I'll get to in a minute.
1:21:59
Once we had this unofficial authorization to proceed, the next big question in
1:22:03
our minds was where can we possibly do this, because we knew that there
1:22:06
was no way we could actually buy land to do it so pretty much had to be
1:22:11
federally administered land somewhere.
1:22:15
We talked to a number of different agencies who had land in the area.
1:22:18
We talked to Bonneville Power Administration, who has a number
1:22:21
of facilities scattered up in the Portland, Vancouver area and in
1:22:24
the Columbia Gorge and so forth.
1:22:27
One of the people I talked to was Fred Swanson, who was the
1:22:30
person I knew best in the Forest Service in the Pacific Northwest.
1:22:33
You'd been around him at St. Helens stuff, right?
1:22:36
Well, and I'd also met him years before, actually, at the H.J. Andrews Forest
1:22:41
when we were leading a field trip focusing on landslides, both within
1:22:45
the Andrews and the larger compass of the Willamette National Forest.
1:22:51
He was talking about the slow-moving landslides?
1:22:53
Slow and fast.
1:22:54
Slow and fast.
1:22:56
We visited some big slow-movers and also some sites where there'd
1:22:59
been rapid, shallow debris flows.
1:23:02
I had known Fred for some years.
1:23:05
Also, a key person who I haven't mentioned yet was Dick Janda, who was my original
1:23:10
boss at the USGS CVO who was an old friend of Fred's and who had also been
1:23:20
one of the people responsible for starting that project down at Redwood Creek
1:23:24
Country where I'd done my Ph.D. work.
1:23:26
Dick was important to have on board as well, even though he had stepped down
1:23:32
from his management job at that point and was no longer my line authority manager.
1:23:42
Just talking to people about where we might possibly do this and it was
1:23:45
Fred Swanson who suggested the H.J. Andrews, which hadn't really occurred
1:23:49
to me because I always thought of it as being more of an ecological, forestry
1:23:54
research area and how would they think about having a big flume built there.
1:24:01
Fred, in turn, I think floated the idea with Art McKee who was the director
1:24:06
of the Andrews Forest at that time and possibly with others in the Forest
1:24:11
Service and not long thereafter we all got together at Andrews to look at
1:24:15
potential sites and here was this site only 100 yards or so from where the
1:24:21
headquarters compound area is at the mouth of Lookout Creek at the Andrews Forest.
1:24:28
Art and Fred agreed that this would be a good place to do it.
1:24:31
Art didn't see any issues in terms of environmental impact really because
1:24:37
it was an area that had been logged recently anyway, and just sort
1:24:40
of second growth scrub in there.
1:24:43
It didn't appear that it was going to harmfully impact anything.
1:24:48
I don't recall that we had to do any sort of formal EIS or anything like that.
1:24:55
The thing that I will send you even if you drop-box or whatever, I didn't
1:24:58
have time to give you a whole thing.
1:25:00
But I've got scanned all the EA preliminary reports that never
1:25:05
went to full EIS, but they had a biological survey, a cultural
1:25:09
survey, a sensitive plant survey.
1:25:11
Just so you know, there was stuff that happened.
1:25:12
Well, I knew that, and that was all going on within the offices of
1:25:17
the Willamette National Forest, so we were extremely fortunate that-
1:25:21
Lynn Burditt, that was the District Ranger.
1:25:22
Well, she was the District Ranger up in the McKenzie Ranger District [Blue
1:25:24
River Ranger District at that time; now merged into the McKenzie River
1:25:24
Ranger District] . Then there were also folks down at their headquarters
1:25:27
office down in Eugene who got involved.
1:25:32
This individual John Cissel
1:25:37
[liaison between the research and land manager communities] . There was
1:25:38
another fella whose name is escaping me.
1:25:40
But we got a tremendous amount of assistance from Forest
1:25:42
Service staff on this stuff.
1:25:44
We in the USGS had no experience doing this because we don't manage land.
1:25:48
We don't build structures.
1:25:50
We don't have that kind of background.
1:25:53
You were coming into this right at the time where the Andrews was a maturing
1:25:58
as an LTER site [Long-Term Ecological Research] , and their campus was
1:26:01
becoming professionalized and nice.
1:26:04
Absolutely.
1:26:05
Yeah.
1:26:06
The "ghetto in the meadow"-
1:26:08
Was disappearing.
1:26:08
Was disappearing.
1:26:10
You were coming in about that time.
1:26:12
Absolutely and in fact when the flume was under construction, which was in 1991,
1:26:18
as I recall that was the same year that they were building, or maybe they had
1:26:24
just completed construction of what is now the headquarters building at the Andrews.
1:26:27
I think that had just been finished in '90 or '91.
1:26:31
The plans were in '90 I believe.
1:26:33
And the shop building had been constructed already.
1:26:35
It's larger today than it was then.
1:26:37
But the building had been constructed and they were just starting to
1:26:41
work on the first of what are now the several housing units there.
1:26:47
So, the flume was built in 1991.
1:26:50
It didn't finish construction until late in the fall, so we didn't actually
1:26:54
use it until the spring of '92.
1:26:57
We did some of the finish work on the flume ourselves, in terms of we built a
1:27:02
small instrument shack there and so forth.
1:27:05
But the timing was very fortuitous in terms of changes that were happening at
1:27:09
the Andrews being basically coincident in time with when we were building the flume.
1:27:15
So,
1:27:20
how did it go from sketch to formal design?
1:27:23
I know there were some back and forths and geotechnical suggestions and adjustments.
1:27:28
I've had the fortune to read all the documents in the last week.
1:27:33
The transition from sketch to formal design, a crucial part of that process was
1:27:41
contracting with an individual professor at Portland State University, Franz Rad,
1:27:45
who was a relatively recent addition to the faculty there whose expertise
1:27:49
was structural reinforced concrete design, perfect for what we had in mind.
1:27:57
I guess I was aware of Franz, or first met him, through another guy who I knew
1:28:03
at Portland State University who was in the Mechanical Engineering Department
1:28:07
who I had recruited one of his students to do some work for us previously,
1:28:12
so I had a bit of a toehold there.
1:28:14
Anyway, Franz was interested in pursuing this project.
1:28:17
I have no recollection of what we paid him in the way of a consultation fee.
1:28:22
He was the one who transformed our drawings into actual construction
1:28:26
documents, meaning that he created the blueprints that were used by
1:28:31
the contractors, both in the bidding and in the construction process.
1:28:35
He developed the actual specs for the concrete, for the steel that
1:28:39
was going to go in the concrete and all those sorts of things.
1:28:43
He transformed it from basically being an idea to something that
1:28:47
looked like construction plans.
1:28:50
Then the next step was once we had those in place, and there was a lot
1:28:53
of iteration between Franz and me.
1:28:55
We would bat things back and forth, which was a fun process and a
1:29:00
completely unique one in my experience.
1:29:02
It really was good that you had your engineering background
1:29:05
because you really could-
1:29:06
I could talk his language.
1:29:07
You could talk shop.
1:29:07
Yeah, I could talk his language.
1:29:09
Interestingly the single biggest point of divergence of opinion was how exactly
1:29:17
are we going to operate those big steel gates at the head of the flume.
1:29:20
At the top of the flume there are these gates that are 2 m high, 2 m wide, and
1:29:26
they retain or have to resist about 20 tons of force against them when you have
1:29:31
this wet sediment piled behind them.
1:29:33
So, they have to be really heavy and build-
1:29:34
Really heavy and really stiff and strong and have a very secure latch mechanism.
1:29:40
Then you have to be able unlatch them and allow them to open very rapidly.
1:29:45
We had lots of discussions about what was going to be the
1:29:47
best design for these gates.
1:29:50
Ultimately, I ended up deferring to Franz's judgment as to how best to do it.
1:29:54
I was in favor of a gate that would pivot on a horizontal hinge so that the gate
1:30:01
would flip open in a vertical sense.
1:30:06
That design had many advantages, but it had one really big disadvantage
1:30:10
and that's in order to open the gate you were going to need some sort of
1:30:14
a hydraulic system that could apply a very large force very quickly to lift up
1:30:25
this huge steel gate and flip it open.
1:30:30
That was a big disadvantage.
1:30:31
The advantage of that type of gate is as it flipped open it enabled
1:30:35
complete clearance for the sediment to just discharge from beneath it.
1:30:38
There was no gate in the way.
1:30:41
Whereas, instead what we have are gates that open sort of saloon door fashion,
1:30:46
where the hinges are mounted vertically on each side wall and when you unlatch
1:30:50
the gate it flips open like a saloon door.
1:30:54
Franz's argument was that from an engineering standpoint this
1:30:57
was a much more straightforward, more bomb-proof kind of design.
1:31:01
I think he was absolutely right.
1:31:04
It has minor disadvantages scientifically because, really
1:31:07
two-fold, one is that the gate does not open instantaneously and clear
1:31:11
room for the sediment to pass through.
1:31:12
It's more of a progressive opening.
1:31:16
The other is that then the gate when it does fully open it impacts the
1:31:19
side walls of the flume and bounces.
1:31:22
Those are disadvantages but I think on balance we've now been running the flume
1:31:26
for a quarter of a century, we've had no mechanical problems with the gate.
1:31:30
The doors have never broken.
1:31:32
Doors have never broken.
1:31:33
Have you replaced them?
1:31:34
No.
1:31:34
No.
1:31:35
They're the originals, okay.
1:31:35
We've replaced the hydraulic system, but that's actually a
1:31:39
pretty inexpensive component.
1:31:41
In this case it's a very simple, off the shelf hydraulic system, not some
1:31:46
huge, powerful specialty system.
1:31:48
Whereas, for example, yesterday I visited the big wave tank facility
1:31:52
here at OSU and there they do have a huge hydraulic system that has to do
1:31:58
something comparable and has to very quickly move this huge steel plate
1:32:02
and create waves at high frequencies.
1:32:06
It's immense.
1:32:08
That's the kind of hydraulic system we probably would have required if we
1:32:11
had a gate of the kind I had in mind.
1:32:13
Which would have been more money than you had.
1:32:16
More money and probably more problematic to keep it functioning.
1:32:20
Long-term maintenance, right.
1:32:20
Exactly.
1:32:21
So, I think on balance Franz's design was a good one
1:32:28
and so that gave us the blueprint for building the flume and the next big
1:32:32
step was actually getting, putting out an announcement and getting
1:32:38
contractors to bid on the project.
1:32:41
Of course, nobody'd ever built anything like this.
1:32:42
Nobody'd ever built anything like this.
1:32:45
The timing was very fortunate because this would have been happening, I
1:32:48
guess in 1990 that this solicitation of bids happened and in 1990 there
1:32:57
was an economic downturn and I can't remember exactly what the scope of that
1:33:01
was and whether it was more regional or national or whatever, but the bottom
1:33:04
line is the contractors were hungry.
1:33:07
They were particularly hungry for things like concrete structures because I think
1:33:12
the downturn had really affected the road and bridge construction industry.
1:33:18
In order to solicit bids, we again worked through the Forest Service because
1:33:23
they had experts who worked for the Willamette National Forest in Eugene.
1:33:28
This was their job.
1:33:30
Their job was designing contracts and orchestrating the
1:33:34
bidding process and so forth.
1:33:37
They basically did that work for us, again with lots of back and forth,
1:33:43
but they did the real heavy lifting
1:33:47
and so pretty soon we had this announcement went out where other
1:33:50
federal announcements go out and we ended up getting four bids,
1:33:55
from four different contractors.
1:33:58
This was the next stage that was a real eye-opener for me because
1:34:01
the bids ranged from about $220,000 to just over a million dollars.
1:34:10
There was almost a factor of 5 difference in the bids.
1:34:15
My reaction to this, being naïve about such things, I
1:34:18
just thought this was baffling.
1:34:19
How could there possibly be a factor of five difference in the bids?
1:34:23
Again, fortunately the professional contracting folks at the Willamette
1:34:27
Forest, being more experienced and knowledgeable, they explained to me, they
1:34:31
said you know this is actually kind of common on these sorts of one-off projects.
1:34:36
The reason is-
1:34:36
Because people don't know, yeah.
1:34:37
There reason is there's quite a bit of risk involved.
1:34:40
It's a new and different kind of thing.
1:34:43
They said, moreover, usually when these federal solicitations come out there will
1:34:47
be a certain number of bidders who they're just going to take a flyer at it in the
1:34:51
hope that nobody else is going to bid.
1:34:56
And they'll get a high bid.
1:34:57
And they'll get a high bid and make a killing on it, an absolute killing on it.
1:35:00
Well, fortunately we had competitive bids and not just this one wild-as
1:35:05
I recall there was this bid for $220, there was another one that
1:35:08
was maybe $300, another one $400 and then way up to a million dollars.
1:35:13
You go with the low bid?
1:35:14
We did go with the low bid, even though the law did not require us to.
1:35:19
Again, the contracting folks explained to me that oftentimes the contractor
1:35:25
who makes the lowest bid, as long as you do due diligence and make sure this
1:35:31
person is actually qualified can make that lowest bid because they're the
1:35:35
most knowledgeable and most experienced in doing similar kinds of work.
1:35:39
In fact, this company that was based in Roseburg, a construction company based in
1:35:44
Roseburg, what they traditionally did was building a lot of small, concrete dams.
1:35:50
When you think of building a small, concrete dam you're working in
1:35:52
steep terrain, you have to pour concrete on steep slopes and get
1:35:57
it to stay in place and so forth.
1:36:00
You're probably going to have to do a lot of slope preparation work.
1:36:03
Really a whole skill set for building something like this.
1:36:07
They did a great job.
1:36:08
They-
1:36:11
What's the name of the company?
1:36:12
Well, I'm trying to remember what the name of the company was.
1:36:14
It'll probably-
1:36:14
I could probably find it in the records, but for the sake of this
1:36:17
recording if you can remember.
1:36:18
Yeah.
1:36:19
Maybe it'll come back to me.
1:36:20
It's escaping me at the moment.
1:36:22
At any event, the project was so successful as a concrete construction
1:36:26
project that actually a year later or something it received this,
1:36:31
there's an award for excellence in construction in concrete which
1:36:34
is given by the Oregon Concrete Association or something of that nature.
1:36:40
Maybe it's broader in scope than Oregon, but anyway so the
1:36:43
contractor received an award.
1:36:46
Was it for the flume?
1:36:47
Yeah, for the flume.
1:36:48
They received an award for the construction.
1:36:52
Franz Rad as the designer received the award and we received the award
1:36:56
as being the owner of the project.
1:36:59
It's called a hat trick.
1:37:01
And that plaque, it's a concrete plaque with a nice brass plate on
1:37:05
it that still hangs down in our instrument shack at the flume.
1:37:09
The award for excellence in concrete.
1:37:12
It's held up remarkably well.
1:37:13
We've made some modest changes over the years.
1:37:18
Frankly, wherever we've made changes and added new concrete hasn't generally held
1:37:24
up as well as the original concrete.
1:37:28
Because how it was designed?
1:37:30
How it was formed?
1:37:31
How it was spec'd.
1:37:33
And the quality of the concrete itself.
1:37:35
The quality of the concrete itself.
1:37:36
Because that's a big deal.
1:37:37
People say it's just concrete.
1:37:38
No, concrete's not just concrete.
1:37:38
No.
1:37:39
It was a very big deal to get the right mix for this stuff and it was a very, very
1:37:42
strong mix and fortunately the weather was favorable when they were pouring it.
1:37:46
It was cool, moist weather, which is what concrete likes for curing and so forth.
1:37:53
No, it's really, really well-built and wherever we've got concrete chipping
1:37:59
away or anything it's where we put in patches for reasons, not for structural
1:38:03
reasons, but we decided that we had to put in some new instruments or something,
1:38:08
so we'd cut away at the concrete and put a patch in or something like that.
1:38:12
Now at the talk you gave last night you talked about it's 31° [slope] , right?
1:38:17
Right.
1:38:18
That was basically, 30° was-
1:38:20
30° was our target.
1:38:22
Your target but you came to the realization that some kind of average
1:38:25
gradient for the stratovolcanoes in the northwest was 31°.
1:38:29
About 30°.
1:38:30
Oh, okay.
1:38:30
Well, no 30° was the target, the design target.
1:38:33
It's just that the slope that was available-
1:38:35
Was 31°.
1:38:36
Was closer to 31°, and the thing is one of the major costs in building
1:38:41
something like this is simply earth moving and we were going to have to do
1:38:46
a lot more earth moving if we leveled it down to 30° than if we kept it at 31°.
1:38:51
So, we just went with 31°.
1:38:52
We were fine with that.
1:39:00
What was I going to ask you?
1:39:00
Now, what difference does it make, if any, that this is in this particular climate?
1:39:10
For the behavior of the dynamics of the flows and all the stats?
1:39:16
I would say that there was an upside and a downside to the climate of the
1:39:18
Andrews for doing experiments like this.
1:39:21
The main thing with the Andrews being that it's wet and that the mean annual
1:39:26
rainfall there is something greater than 2 m, and I don't know the exact number.
1:39:30
But it basically means-
1:39:31
It's 80 something, I think.
1:39:32
Yeah, 80-some inches.
1:39:34
Because you're on the west gradient of the west slope of the Cascades.
1:39:36
So, it's wet and it's
1:39:41
sort of reliably wet for about 8 or 9 months of the year and that effectively
1:39:47
limits our experiment season to the months of May through September.
1:39:53
We've done them at other times of the year.
1:39:55
We've tried doing them as early as March.
1:39:56
Because you need it when it's not wet so you can control-
1:39:59
So, we can control water contents.
1:40:01
And equally important, when you're working with a lot of electronics, and
1:40:05
we have a great deal of electronics at the flume and many, many wiring
1:40:08
connections and so forth, water is not your friend in that environment.
1:40:13
You've got to keep your electronic connections dry.
1:40:17
We work in the rain.
1:40:18
We've done a lot of working in the rain there, but it slows us down.
1:40:21
It complicates things.
1:40:23
It's a lot easier to work when the weather is nice.
1:40:26
In the early years when we were really motivated to maximize our number of
1:40:29
experiments we started as early as March and we continued through October
1:40:34
and we worked in a lot of pretty miserable weather in March and October
1:40:39
so now in more recent years we've limited our window for working there.
1:40:45
The wetness has a downside.
1:40:48
The upside to the wetness there is that we've always had an
1:40:52
ample water supply, because our experiments do use a lot of water.
1:40:55
We've got to mix up debris flows, which take a lot of water and then we need
1:40:59
a lot of additional water for cleaning up the mess at the end of experiments.
1:41:03
We've always been able to just withdraw our water from Lookout Creek, which
1:41:07
is only roughly 100 yards away from the flume and it's a big enough
1:41:13
creek that our rate of withdrawal, which is only 4 or 5 gallons a
1:41:17
minute is kind of inconsequential.
1:41:23
Do
1:41:25
you remember when it was christened?
1:41:27
When it was finished?
1:41:29
Oh yeah.
1:41:30
Tell me about the finishing.
1:41:34
Was there like an anointing or a ceremony?
1:41:37
Well, there wasn't so much a ceremony when it was finished, because like a
1:41:40
lot of construction projects it sort of approached finish asymptotically
1:41:46
and the final finishing touches were things, we did ourselves in terms
1:41:49
of, again, building this instrument shelter and that sort of thing.
1:41:54
What was more profound, I guess, was the first experiment, the first
1:41:58
attempt to actually use the flume.
1:42:00
Tell me about that.
1:42:02
So, the very first attempt was a foolish one that was probably guaranteed to be
1:42:07
a disaster because we hadn't thought things through very carefully, I guess.
1:42:13
What we did for our very first experiment, and this again we did this in March.
1:42:18
The weather was wet and cold.
1:42:21
At that time, we didn't appreciate just how much manpower it was going
1:42:25
to take for these experiments.
1:42:26
There were just 3 of us working there.
1:42:28
It was Rick LaHusen, Tony Bequette, and myself.
1:42:33
We went down there and the hopper area at the top of the flume behind
1:42:37
the steel gates is capable of holding as much as 20 m3 of sediment.
1:42:44
Now, in recent years we've never used that much because it proved to be
1:42:47
impractical, but for some reason we had it in our mindset we're not going
1:42:52
to skimp on the first experiment.
1:42:53
We're going to load it right up to the top.
1:42:55
We put in a full 20 m3.
1:42:59
We also chose to do use pea gravel because-
1:43:03
Without any mud in it.
1:43:04
No mud in it.
1:43:05
Okay.
1:43:05
Basically, because we thought it'd be simple to clean up because there
1:43:08
wouldn't be any mud to make a big mess.
1:43:10
It'd just be nice, clean gravel.
1:43:14
We sort of had it in our heads, or I had it in my head anyway, that what
1:43:17
was going to happen when we opened the gates is that this pea gravel would
1:43:22
flow down the flume and basically pile up in a heap at the foot of the flume.
1:43:28
What I didn't take into account was the fact that it was early
1:43:32
spring, and the pea gravel was wet.
1:43:36
It wasn't by any means saturated but it was very moist.
1:43:39
And moist gravel has a lot of-
1:43:42
Sticks together.
1:43:42
Sort of stick together.
1:43:44
It's all due to the capillary forces, you know the little films of water that are
1:43:48
binding the gravel particles together.
1:43:51
We're all excited.
1:43:52
This is going to be the big, grand opening of the flume.
1:43:55
We release the gate and the pea gravel, 20 m3 of pea gravel just sort of drizzles
1:44:01
slowly down the flume and leaves the entire bed of the flume from top to bottom
1:44:07
coated with pea gravel about 10 cm thick.
1:44:11
So, you had to clean that mess that was-
1:44:12
So, now the question is how the heck are we going to get
1:44:15
this pea gravel out of there.
1:44:16
Because it's hard to climb out of that thing, isn't it?
1:44:18
Yeah, really hard, especially when there's pea gravel underfoot.
1:44:23
When the flume bed is nice and clean, bare concrete, you can walk up and down
1:44:26
it without too much difficulty but not when it's got slippery stuff underfoot.
1:44:31
There are only 3 of us there to do the work.
1:44:35
So, we spent the rest of that week, we were there for an entire week and we spent
1:44:40
3 or 4 days of that week, the three of us, getting this pea gravel out of the flume.
1:44:48
The way we did it, this was just-thank God we were young then, because
1:44:51
this was just back breaking work.
1:44:58
Getting the gravel down the flume was a non-trivial deal.
1:45:03
Couldn't you just wash it down with water?
1:45:05
Well, at that time we didn't have-later we did have a high-pressure pump where
1:45:11
we could blast things with water.
1:45:13
We didn't have it at the time.
1:45:15
So, it was going to be some sort of manual operation.
1:45:17
You can't just sweep it down, didn't you?
1:45:18
Well, what we ended up doing-we started out just trying to push
1:45:22
it down with shovels and stuff and that was way too much work.
1:45:25
So, what we ended up doing is Tony on the spot, he had, I can't remember
1:45:30
if he had a welder with him or
1:45:34
how exactly this was fabricated but somehow-maybe we came back-anyway, he
1:45:39
fabricated what was essentially a dredge, like a steel plow that fit inside the
1:45:48
flume and was designed in such a way that Rick and I could stand on the back
1:45:53
of it to apply our bodyweight to it.
1:45:56
What we would do is we had a winch on a big pickup down at the foot of the
1:46:01
flume and we would drag that winch cable up to the top, hook it onto this
1:46:06
big dredge thing, and then we would just stand on it and Tony would engage
1:46:11
the winch and we would ride this thing down trying to dredge the gravel down.
1:46:16
After 3 or 4 days we finally got all the gravel down to the foot of the flume.
1:46:21
Were there people from the Andrews there that witnessed the first
1:46:24
experiment or was it just you three?
1:46:25
I think it was just us three.
1:46:26
I think we realized-
1:46:27
Aren't you glad?
1:46:27
I think we realized, I know that this was kind of a high-risk operation and there
1:46:32
was a high chance of failure, so we tried to do it when there was nobody around.
1:46:38
Of course, that time of the year there are very few people at the Andrews.
1:46:41
It's kind of a skeletal staff during that season, especially in
1:46:45
those days, more so than today.
1:46:48
So, this was in 1992.
1:46:49
This was in '92, yeah.
1:46:50
So that whole first season of 1992 we were down there, we
1:46:54
spent a lot of time at the flume.
1:46:55
We were down there pretty much one week a month for the next five or six months,
1:47:03
and it was just a gradual learning experience of how to use the flume.
1:47:10
How did you write up the learning curve?
1:47:12
Almost like not in the sense that we learned all this great science,
1:47:17
but we learned how not to and then eventually how to use the flume.
1:47:21
We never did write up a learning curve like that, in part because by and large
1:47:27
people don't have interest in something like that when it's a one-off facility.
1:47:31
If this was something that other people were going to be doing somewhere else,
1:47:34
then they'd probably have interest in learning about our mistakes.
1:47:36
Well, we want to know what happens if you don't do this.
1:47:40
So, the only people who have had interest, and this has been much, much later, just
1:47:43
within the last several years is that the Chinese are now building their own flume.
1:47:48
The Chinese did come and visit us, and we spent an entire day
1:47:51
with them at the Andrews talking about how to try to do it right.
1:47:56
I'm not sure if they'll embrace all of our advice, but we did
1:48:00
our best to convey our advice.
1:48:04
One of those pieces of advice was you need to be thinking about cleanup.
1:48:08
Don't just be thinking about how you're going to do the experiments,
1:48:11
think about how you're going to clean up after the experiments and have a
1:48:14
plan for how you're going to do that.
1:48:15
And this is when the concrete's relatively smooth, because you added-
1:48:19
Yeah, the bumps later.
1:48:20
Texture and bumps, yeah.
1:48:21
Yeah.
1:48:22
And that would have made it harder, right?
1:48:23
Oh yeah, much harder.
1:48:25
Thank goodness it was smooth in those days.
1:48:27
Did you ever ski the flume, Dick?
1:48:31
No.
1:48:31
It looks kind of like a giant ski jump, but you'd have to be, well, maybe there
1:48:35
are crazy young people out there who'd be willing to ski it, but I wouldn't,
1:48:38
not with concrete walls on either side.
1:48:42
No opportunity to make turns on that flume.
1:48:44
No.
1:48:47
So, yeah,
1:48:50
that whole first season was just a learning experience with really
1:48:55
no meaningful scientific results.
1:48:57
It was all just about how to try to use the facility.
1:49:01
The biggest challenge we ran into, once we understood the limitations of
1:49:07
what kind and volume of sediment we could use, the next big challenge we
1:49:11
ran into was how to seal the gate in such a way that we could retain water
1:49:17
behind it and have very little leakage.
1:49:19
As your saturating whatever-
1:49:20
As we're saturating the sediment.
1:49:22
Yet at the same time have the gate be completely unencumbered when it opens.
1:49:27
We tried a number of things, but, basically, I recall four
1:49:32
different attempts, the final one of which was successful.
1:49:37
One attempt was just using neoprene flaps.
1:49:40
We somehow had the notion that if you had nice, flexible neoprene that the
1:49:44
sheer force of the sediment up against it would create some sort of a sealing bond.
1:49:50
Then we tried using clay, modeling clay, packing the cracks with modeling clay.
1:49:55
That didn't work.
1:49:57
Then we tried various kinds of caulks and so forth that you might use for
1:50:02
caulking household flashing and so forth.
1:50:05
That didn't work.
1:50:06
The thing that we finally tried, which we've been using ever since,
1:50:09
and this stuff was quite new on the market at this time, is polyurethane
1:50:16
expansive foam insulation.
1:50:20
This is this really sticky stuff-
1:50:21
Kind of like the stuff you spray on the roofs in the southwest kind of stuff?
1:50:25
I don't know if they use it on the roofs in the southwest, but they
1:50:28
use it for construction around here.
1:50:29
If you have just a little gap in a wall, like you've done some new construction,
1:50:36
you put in a new electrical outlet or something and you now have a gap around
1:50:40
it and you want to fill you buy this spray foam stuff and [whooshing noise] just
1:50:43
blast it in there with the spray foam.
1:50:45
The thing is the stuff is super sticky and it expands to fill space.
1:50:49
That's important but it's single most important property probably from
1:50:53
our standpoint is that it for the first several hours after you apply
1:51:00
it, it remains really quite pliable.
1:51:03
Eventually it becomes almost rigid, but from our standpoint-
1:51:08
But it'll hold long enough.
1:51:09
But, it'll hold long enough.
1:51:09
The key for us, and this was a learning process as well, is you apply the
1:51:14
foam to all the cracks that you're trying to seal and then you give
1:51:18
it roughly one hour of cure time.
1:51:20
It's developed a nice, leathery, tough skin on it but it's still kind of pliable.
1:51:25
Then you load the sediment in water behind the gate while that stuff is still
1:51:30
kind of pliable and the reason you want it to be pliable is that with that 20
1:51:34
tons of force against that steel gate, it actually does flex a little bit.
1:51:39
So, the crack that you're trying to seal is not a completely static crack.
1:51:43
It's one that grows a little bit through this flexure of the gate.
1:51:46
But that keeps the moisture behind.
1:51:49
It traps the water and the foam is pliable enough that it will kind
1:51:54
of expand as the crack expands.
1:51:56
And the stuff works, when you do a good job-I mean, like any job you
1:52:00
can do a good job of it, you can do a poor job of it, but when you do a good
1:52:03
job it's essentially an ideal seal.
1:52:07
It works really well, and we learned that totally by trial and error.
1:52:11
It took you a couple of years to figure that out.
1:52:13
Yeah, probably a couple of years before we really had that wired.
1:52:16
There was a long learning curve.
1:52:18
Now, describing the learning curve regarding the matrixes and the
1:52:22
combinations of materials, explain a little bit about that-from the
1:52:26
pea gravel to mud, to water, I mean all the different things
1:52:32
that you used.
1:52:32
We realized early on that pea gravel was a pretty poor
1:52:34
representation of a debris flow.
1:52:36
We never thought it would be a good representation, but it was
1:52:38
nice, easy material to work with.
1:52:40
So, the first material that we worked with that more resembled debris flow was
1:52:47
simple, standard, what the local sand and gravel retailer would just in those days
1:52:51
would refer to as their concrete mix.
1:52:53
It was just about a 50/50 mix of sand and gravel.
1:52:56
The gravel is rounded river rock, sort of ¾" rounded river rock, just
1:53:02
like they'd make sidewalks out of.
1:53:04
That actually works pretty well.
1:53:06
There's enough sand in it and enough fine sand in it that it will actually
1:53:10
retain water and retain pore pressure when it's released and deformed.
1:53:16
But it's not as realistic as when you add mud to that material.
1:53:20
As years went by, we moved more towards material that started with
1:53:25
that same sand/gravel mix but to that mix we added 20% loam by dry weight.
1:53:33
The loam itself had a grain size distribution such that we ended up
1:53:37
with a silt and clay content that was about 8% by dry weight, which makes
1:53:42
a nice muddy mixture that we could still work with pretty practically.
1:53:47
We've tried using still more mud.
1:53:49
We've tried using as much as 50% mud, and then you run into all sorts of practical
1:53:55
problems with just getting the stuff wet.
1:53:59
Anything that's really muddy just becomes a nightmare to work with, both
1:54:03
in terms of getting it wet and then in terms of cleaning it up once it is wet.
1:54:07
It just sticks to everything.
1:54:10
The majority of our experiments have been done with one of those two mixes:
1:54:14
the sand-gravel or the sand-gravel-mud.
1:54:17
We have used other materials.
1:54:18
For example, we've left out the gravel entirely and just used a sandy mix,
1:54:23
or we've added larger rocks, sort of fist-sized rocks, because big rocks
1:54:27
do play an important role in debris flow, so we've done that as well.
1:54:32
But the basic materials have been those two mixtures.
1:54:36
Then,
1:54:39
the other key variable that we changed over the course of the year was just
1:54:43
the texture of the flume bed itself.
1:54:45
It started out for the first 8 years it was a relatively smooth concrete
1:54:51
surface, a broomed finish, similar to what they'd apply to standard sidewalks.
1:54:56
Then in the year 2000 we added bumps to the entire, or nearly
1:55:01
the entire bed of the flume.
1:55:04
We specially fabricated some concrete tiles that had exactly the texture
1:55:09
we wanted to produce the amount of friction that we wanted and then
1:55:12
laboriously applied those tiles, grouted them to the bed of the flume.
1:55:17
That was a project we did ourselves.
1:55:18
We didn't hire a contractor.
1:55:21
A group of about 8 of us spent an entire week at the flume with this elaborate,
1:55:27
orchestrated process of mixing grout and tiling the entire bed of the flume.
1:55:33
Did this work out well?
1:55:34
It did.
1:55:35
It's worked out extremely well.
1:55:36
It hasn't broken, or you haven't had to-
1:55:38
It hasn't broken and we, I remember, Matt Logan, who was the mastermind for
1:55:43
how exactly we were going to build these tiles and apply them and so forth he used
1:55:49
to jokingly he'd say, well, the design life of this, this is about 5 years.
1:55:54
He wasn't going to give it more than 5 years.
1:55:56
He wasn't optimistic about the long duration, right?
1:55:58
No, but Matt has a history of building things extremely well and
1:56:05
thoughtfully, and the fact is now 17 years have passed and those tiles
1:56:09
are hanging in there just great.
1:56:11
Basically, they went in in 2000, then?
1:56:12
The year 2000, yeah.
1:56:15
Okay.
1:56:16
What about the sensors?
1:56:18
You talked about last night at your talk that that would
1:56:21
be really hard to add more.
1:56:23
You never have, correct?
1:56:25
We have actually in one location.
1:56:28
We have put in a new cross section down near the foot of the flume.
1:56:32
How many were in the original design?
1:56:33
In the original design, what there were, were
1:56:38
3 pods of sensor ports in the bed of the flume and each one of
1:56:42
those pods had 6 individual ports.
1:56:45
A port consists of a block out in the bed of the flume where there's roughly
1:56:49
a cubic foot of concrete that's missing from the bed and there's a hollow
1:56:53
underneath that and the idea is you put your instrument in that hollow
1:56:56
and cap it off with a metal plate.
1:56:59
There were 18 of those in the bed of the flume initially and then,
1:57:03
well, I guess initially that's all there were, were just those 18.
1:57:08
Then as we added to the runout area at the foot of the flume, we successfully added
1:57:12
more concrete to create a progressively larger concrete runout area to contain
1:57:18
our flows entirely within the concrete.
1:57:21
We added some instrumentation ports out there and then at the time it was
1:57:29
coincident with the time that we tiled the bed of the flume we realized that we also
1:57:34
had an opportunity then to maybe put in a new cross section of these ports down near
1:57:42
the foot of the flume at the 80 m mark.
1:57:43
80 m downslope from the gate.
1:57:46
It's 95 m, right?
1:57:46
It's 95 m top to bottom.
1:57:49
We did that and that was laborious because that involved actually sawing
1:57:55
into this thick concrete and cutting through a lot of rebar and so forth
1:57:59
and then having to drill laterally through the subsurface because these
1:58:03
boxes that house the instruments have to have their wires come out beneath
1:58:08
the flume along the side of the flume, so you had to drill in laterally in
1:58:11
order to accomplish that as well.
1:58:12
Were you afraid that you might compromise the structure by doing too much of that?
1:58:17
No, simply because by that time enough years had passed that we
1:58:22
had a great deal of faith in the structural integrity of the thing.
1:58:27
Remarkably being built on a 31° slope, there's never been
1:58:32
any sign that the structure as a whole has shifted over time.
1:58:36
In terms of land settling or anything?
1:58:38
Yeah, exactly.
1:58:39
I think part of the reason for that-well, it's all about the way it was constructed.
1:58:44
Part of the construction is that on either side of the flume sort of
1:58:47
stepping up along its length are big concrete pads that are bolted into the
1:58:54
flume itself and those concrete pads in turn have big rock bolts, steel
1:59:01
bolts that are probably 4" diameter or something, rock bolts that go all the
1:59:06
way down to bedrock at those locations.
1:59:09
In principle the whole structure is pinned to bedrock.
1:59:13
What passes for bedrock around there-we're not talking Sierra Nevada granite.
1:59:18
It's pretty punky, old
1:59:22
semi-metamorphosed volcanic rock.
1:59:25
That's a pretty old part of the Cascades.
1:59:27
Yeah, it's old Cascades and so none of the rock there is very solid.
1:59:31
Nonetheless, I think just having anchors that go down 40' or 50' makes a difference
1:59:36
in terms of holding the thing in place.
1:59:39
Alright, of course.
1:59:40
What about photographic-how was that set up originally and what
1:59:45
have you added in terms of?
1:59:47
I mean you hear the cameras when they're shooting, I mean there must
1:59:50
be several ports or places for that-
1:59:53
Absolutely.
1:59:53
We use lots of cameras to record these things from different
1:59:57
angles, different locations.
1:59:59
That, like so many other things, the technology has changed so greatly
2:00:03
over the course of the quarter century we've been working there.
2:00:07
When we first started working there, you have to remember what video
2:00:11
cameras looked like in those days.
2:00:12
So, we initially had one video camera.
2:00:16
It was a VHS, full-sized VSH video camera that you carried around in a big suitcase.
2:00:24
It cost something like $3,000 for just a primitive VHS video camera
2:00:31
and then we started incrementally adding cameras over the years.
2:00:35
Still frames, they changed as well, but we started out with more of
2:00:40
a full battery of SLR still-frame cameras with motor drives so we could
2:00:43
record sequences of still photos.
2:00:47
By
2:00:50
the mid '90s, that seems about right in my mind, video
2:00:57
technology was already changing.
2:01:00
Remember there was an 8
2:01:04
mm format and then something they called high-8 or super-8 mm format
2:01:08
video camera and we kind of kept increasing the level of technology.
2:01:12
Of course, now everything is digital HD and costs one tenth of what our
2:01:18
big old VSH camera cost back then.
2:01:20
I can imagine how much film you must have gone through in the still cameras.
2:01:24
We went through a lot of film on those still cameras.
2:01:25
I mean now you can just get chips and shoot as many as you want.
2:01:28
Absolutely and for much less cost.
2:01:31
Because we went through a great deal of 35 mm film.
2:01:33
In my office I have a shelf that's probably 10 ft long that's full of
2:01:40
nothing full of notebooks full of 35 mm slides and black and white
2:01:44
negatives of all those old photos.
2:01:47
We have digitized all those, however, so they now all of those many thousands
2:01:51
of photos exist in digital form.
2:01:54
Of course, the digitized version never looks quite as sharp
2:01:58
as the original film version.
2:02:01
Anyway, the changes in video technology have really helped us a lot.
2:02:07
We can do so much more nowadays with these HD digital videos, because you
2:02:12
can get sharp stills out of the videos.
2:02:14
In fact, to some degree the videos have almost entirely supplanted
2:02:18
using still frame cameras at all because particularly the newer 4K
2:02:25
HD video stills look just as good as a regular still camera photo when
2:02:32
viewed on a standard computer screen.
2:02:34
I'm sure if you expanded the image enough, you'd see a difference.
2:02:39
You shoot everything in big, raw type format things where you can blow
2:02:43
them up and really analyze micro?
2:02:47
Certainly, with the still photography we've shot a lot of raw photos,
2:02:51
so it gives us more latitude for post-processing and so on.
2:02:57
We do a lot of stuff that's sort of photogrammetric in terms of trying
2:03:01
to infer 3D shapes of deposits and so forth based on photogrammetry.
2:03:07
Our way of deploying cameras has changed a lot over the years, too.
2:03:12
You asked about that.
2:03:13
Where it's changed the most is at the foot of the flume where we've
2:03:17
always known that we wanted to do overhead photography because it's
2:03:21
really great to have a vertical view looking down on top of that runout area
2:03:25
when the deposits are being formed.
2:03:28
That, too, was a real learning curve endeavor.
2:03:32
The very first efforts at doing that we tried using a balloon,
2:03:35
or a blimp, a small helium blimp.
2:03:38
Like above everything?
2:03:39
Yeah, we put a camera in a box and hoisted up on this little blimp and
2:03:48
the problem with that is that any amount of wind whatsoever, if there's
2:03:53
even a breath of wind, you've got this big, bulbous blimp up in the
2:03:56
air and it's just getting tossed.
2:03:58
You can't control the thing.
2:04:00
Of course, for photos you really want a fixed frame of reference.
2:04:03
You don't want something blowing all over.
2:04:05
That was a failure.
2:04:06
The blimp was a rapid failure.
2:04:09
Then we built a,
2:04:13
so we put up a tower kind of like one of those prefab metal radio tower type
2:04:20
assemblies that went up about 30 ft. On the end of that put a big boom arm and
2:04:26
suspended a camera off that boom arm.
2:04:28
That actually worked pretty well but it gave us limited range because you could
2:04:34
only reach out as far as the boom reached.
2:04:37
When the flows got out beyond that point you lost them from the field of view.
2:04:41
Then in later years what we did is assemble a second tower, second sort
2:04:46
of prefab steel radio-type tower further out in the runout area and we
2:04:51
now have an overhead cable that sort of serves as a gantry or tramway for
2:04:58
a traveling cable car that has cameras housed in it, which is a much better
2:05:04
way of doing the overhead photography.
2:05:08
Of course, the improvements in cameras over the years have made that
2:05:11
whole process much simpler as well.
2:05:15
Now, the sensors measure speed and force and what else?
2:05:22
Well, the sensors in the bed of the flume measure normal force on the bed; shear
2:05:29
force on the bed; which is something that we've only been able to do in
2:05:31
relatively recent years because it's a much trickier thing to measure than normal
2:05:35
force; pore fluid pressure on the bed; and then suspended above those sensors
2:05:42
we have lasers that measure the evolving thickness of the flow passing overhead.
2:05:48
That combination of measurements tells you a great deal about
2:05:52
the mechanics of the flow.
2:05:56
When do you feel that you kind of had it down of how this thing operated
2:06:02
and how you could best use it?
2:06:03
How the flume operated?
2:06:04
Yeah, I mean when could you say I'm comfortable with this creation and getting
2:06:09
the best scientific results out of it.
2:06:12
I think we felt really good about it operationally as early as
2:06:17
say 1994, so within a couple of years of beginning operations.
2:06:21
I felt like we knew how to make debris flows reliably and we could start actually
2:06:26
posing important scientific questions.
2:06:29
We started doing experiments involving things like runout processes and flow
2:06:34
around a curve and that sort of thing.
2:06:36
Things you can actually compare to model predictions systematically and it'll be
2:06:41
useful for testing and calibrating models.
2:06:45
So, we knew by 1994 that we had a really useful tool on our hands and probably the
2:06:52
biggest frustration in those earlier years had more to do with our sensor and data
2:06:59
acquisition technology, because it was so much more primitive than it is nowadays.
2:07:06
We couldn't collect data as rapidly.
2:07:09
All of our data had to be transmitted in analogue form via long cables to a
2:07:14
central computer and so we might have electronic sensors that were 100 m away
2:07:19
from the computer that was logging the data and the thing is transmitting a
2:07:24
small, electronic signal through a long cable is inherently a bad idea, because
2:07:31
there's all sorts of opportunities for introducing electronic noise and so on.
2:07:35
Well, nowadays what we do is we digitize the data very close to where
2:07:39
the sensors are, and the data are transmitted through an ethernet cable.
2:07:44
Once everything is digitized, it's now basically free of
2:07:49
introducing new electronic noise as it travels down the cable.
2:07:53
Of course, the computer is so much faster.
2:07:55
It's cheaper.
2:07:56
Everything is so much better and easier than it was in those early days.
2:08:05
That was a much longer learning curve than learning how to use the
2:08:09
flume as a mechanical facility.
2:08:10
That learning curve of learning how to take advantage of technology
2:08:16
to get the best quality data.
2:08:19
Of course, partly it was just a financial matter, too.
2:08:21
If we had had unlimited financial reserves back in the 1980s, we could
2:08:28
have done what the military does and just throw huge amounts of money at it
2:08:32
and probably had a pretty good system.
2:08:33
But we were doing everything on the cheap, using just off-the-shelf
2:08:38
or stuff we fabricated ourselves.
2:08:40
How many questions do you get from the skeptics for the $250,000
2:08:45
higher up from the USGS and how long before you had good answers?
2:08:49
Well, nowadays we really don't have skeptics.
2:08:51
I think everybody realizes-
2:08:53
But, back then?
2:08:55
Well, I don't know.
2:08:56
I didn't interact a lot with the skeptics.
2:08:59
I knew who they were.
2:09:02
I think that frankly by 1997,
2:09:07
we had pretty much dammed up most of that skepticism, because that's when
2:09:11
our first set of major papers came out.
2:09:15
Prior to that we'd had some minor publications and conference
2:09:20
proceedings and that sort of thing.
2:09:22
But in 1997 we had a wave of major publications that really laid out
2:09:28
the basics of how we understood the mechanics of these flows to be working.
2:09:34
I think once those papers appeared that kind of shut everybody up, because
2:09:39
they realized that this was valuable.
2:09:42
That was about the time when essential assumptions that were had about geological
2:09:50
processes, debris flows, this was either challenging or supporting or overturning
2:09:56
or providing tangible, believable evidence that said, okay, this is for real.
2:10:02
This really does.
2:10:02
And we have to rethink or-
2:10:04
Yeah, absolutely.
2:10:06
It essentially established a completely new way of thinking
2:10:12
about the mechanics of debris flows.
2:10:14
The fundamental underlying mechanics, there was nothing new about that.
2:10:19
It was still Newton's laws.
2:10:20
It was still basic principles of mechanics of two-phased systems.
2:10:27
But the fact that we could make measurements that demonstrated
2:10:30
that this two-phase aspect of the behavior was really important and
2:10:34
was really influencing the overall mechanics and wasn't a minor nuance.
2:10:38
It was a central element of how you had to think about these things.
2:10:42
That was important.
2:10:43
Taking into account-it kind of happens in all fields-Thomas Kuhn's
2:10:49
theory of scientific revolutions and the process of this belief and its
2:10:54
supporters, no matter what the evidence is originally pushing back and-
2:11:00
Oh, we've run into that.
2:11:01
Tell me a little about that.
2:11:05
Yeah, I certainly have read enough about the philosophy of science as
2:11:08
espoused by people like Thomas Kuhn to understand how it hypothetically works.
2:11:16
But I think the reality is different in different fields of science.
2:11:21
A lot of it has to do with people's perceptions, which
2:11:24
they're more than perceptions.
2:11:26
They're realities, I think, as to how important it is for people to
2:11:31
embrace a fundamentally new view.
2:11:35
A lot of those philosophers of science in the 20th century they always use the
2:11:41
development of quantum mechanics as their
2:11:46
prototypical case because of course for a period of years, maybe a decade
2:11:51
or so, there was a lot of pushback against people who were starting
2:11:55
to develop quantum mechanics.
2:11:57
But very quickly that pushback disappeared because the evidence became
2:12:02
overwhelming that this really did work and it really did not only describe
2:12:07
real-world phenomena but that some of these were really useful things that were
2:12:11
going to be important technologically.
2:12:12
In the practical world.
2:12:13
Yeah.
2:12:14
That dissipated the skepticism pretty quickly.
2:12:17
Similarly, with
2:12:21
the discovery or really the documentation is maybe a better word
2:12:26
of the structure of DNA, people knew.
2:12:31
There was a real scientific competition underway at that time to try to uncover
2:12:36
that because people already knew this was going to be really important.
2:12:39
When the structure was published there wasn't a lot of pushback.
2:12:43
Everybody knew right off this is really fundamental.
2:12:46
This is important.
2:12:47
I think that a lot of these people who study the philosophy of science
2:12:50
they tend to focus on those really profound things like that rather
2:12:54
than what I would call ordinary science, which is more the kind I do.
2:12:59
I think the difference with ordinary science is that the
2:13:03
consequences of somebody retaining their older cherished view of
2:13:10
something are really not very great.
2:13:14
They can continue to publish papers and so forth and they can continue to
2:13:17
follow the path they've been following without much in the way of consequences
2:13:22
because it's not as though the field has suddenly turned like the turning
2:13:27
of the Titanic and everybody's got to head off in this new direction or
2:13:31
you're just completely left behind.
2:13:33
There's still lots of room for people to keep doing things as they have.
2:13:37
That's very true in debris flow science.
2:13:41
You'll still find people nowadays, it's a minority, but you'll still
2:13:44
find people who treat debris flows as Bingham materials and so forth.
2:13:49
They can still publish papers and that sort of thing.
2:13:52
Describe Bingham materials
2:13:54
Bingham materials, again, that's a person's name but it describes,
2:13:58
the other descriptive term is a viscoplastic material, and what it is,
2:14:02
is a material that's a single-phase, homogeneous continuous material that
2:14:08
has two important physical properties.
2:14:10
One is that it has viscosity just like a conventional liquid, like water or
2:14:14
honey being a more viscous material, but it also has yield strength, meaning
2:14:19
that it won't start to flow until you have it on a steep-enough slope
2:14:25
or there's a deep-enough pile of it.
2:14:27
It's more like ketchup.
2:14:28
Ketchup is the classic viscoplastic material that a
2:14:32
lot of people are familiar with.
2:14:33
You put ketchup on a plate, and it doesn't immediately spread
2:14:38
out like a puddle of water would.
2:14:40
It sits there because it has this certain amount of strength.
2:14:43
If you tip the plate to a steep-enough angle, the ketchup will start to flow.
2:14:48
It's a very simple way of thinking about things and it also is attractive
2:14:52
to people because it's very easy to work with mathematically.
2:14:56
But as far as I'm concerned, it's just plain wrong.
2:15:00
I think the majority of the community has appreciated that at this point.
2:15:08
But there also can be a disconnect I think between the research side of things and
2:15:14
the people who are doing, say, practical consulting work and who don't have
2:15:19
time necessarily to read and appreciate all the latest research findings.
2:15:25
It's really been in the consulting community that they've continued
2:15:29
to embrace this idea of Bingham models and so forth because they
2:15:32
can buy off the shelf software that will do this for them and so on.
2:15:36
They don't have to get involved in all this more complicated stuff.
2:15:42
What was the importance beyond infrastructure of having
2:15:47
this built at the Andrews?
2:15:52
Obviously, you have the support of the water, the infrastructure, the lodging,
2:15:55
but what about the fact that the Andrews has become a famous ecosystem
2:16:01
science, it's learned, it's a community.
2:16:05
It's an experience, a place.
2:16:06
Well, you can think of the importance, I guess, in two different ways.
2:16:10
The importance to us as a group working at the Andrews is not only all the ancillary
2:16:18
services that are available to us there: the housing, the shop, and so forth.
2:16:22
Nowadays we have internet access there and so on.
2:16:25
There's all this stuff that we probably wouldn't have access to.
2:16:31
There are also the human resources.
2:16:33
There are the people right there, the full-time employees at the
2:16:36
Andrews site who we've interacted with a lot over the years and have
2:16:41
been extremely helpful to us when-
2:16:43
I bet you Terry Cryer helped you a lot.
2:16:44
Terry, I mean, to give you an example of a crisis-
2:16:47
He just retired; you know.
2:16:47
Yeah.
2:16:48
To give you an example of a crisis situation we ran into one time,
2:16:53
we were right in the middle of an experiment.
2:16:56
The whole flume was wired with AC line power as part of the
2:17:01
greater Andrews power system.
2:17:05
We're right in the middle of an experiment and a construction crew was doing
2:17:10
some road work down near Blue River Reservoir somewhere and they accidently
2:17:15
cut through the main power line.
2:17:17
Just like that all the power goes out to the whole Andrews site.
2:17:21
We've got this experiment that's at a crux stage.
2:17:25
We're past the point of no return.
2:17:27
We have to keep going with this experiment.
2:17:29
We've lost all our power, so we go running over to Terry who quickly
2:17:35
supplies with a couple of big generators and we plug those into our system and
2:17:40
so now we've got line power again.
2:17:42
They've rescued us that way.
2:17:44
They've rescued us when our phone has gone out.
2:17:47
Our phone line has gone out on occasion and we've had to
2:17:50
fall back on the Andrews phone.
2:17:52
They've helped us in countless ways.
2:17:56
Then there's
2:17:59
a more subtle but broader kind of impact that the Andrews has had on
2:18:06
us, which is that just the countless visitors and researchers who passed
2:18:12
through the Andrews, most of whom are biologists of one or the other but it's
2:18:16
a great, great variety of scientists and almost all them come to understand
2:18:22
that the flume is there because it's so close to where they're lodgings are.
2:18:27
Many of them will come and watch an experiment if they happen to
2:18:30
be on site at a convenient time.
2:18:34
So, it's given an opportunity for us to not only expose them to this type
2:18:39
of work but educate them a little bit about the kind of work we do and
2:18:42
why we do it and why we think it's important and also how it fits into the
2:18:46
bigger picture of ecosystem science.
2:18:51
In these steep,
2:18:54
sort of temperate rainforests, really, that we have on the western slope of
2:18:57
the Cascades or in the Coast Range of the Pacific Northwest, debris flows
2:19:02
are such a pervasive process that they really do have a major imprint on
2:19:10
redistributing material and nutrients and so forth in these watersheds.
2:19:14
One of the best examples I can think of is the redistribution of woody debris.
2:19:19
Something people have come to realize over the last few decades is how important
2:19:24
debris jams are in small streams in terms of providing habitat for smolts [young
2:19:31
fish] , whether it's salmon, whether it's just resident fish, whatever it might be.
2:19:38
A steep-mountain stream is a pretty inhospitable environment unless
2:19:41
it has sheltered areas within it.
2:19:43
A lot of that woody debris that makes its way into these channels is there
2:19:48
because debris flow has carried it in.
2:19:51
Exactly.
2:19:53
What about more existentially about just the energy, the almost existential,
2:19:58
spiritual quality of a high-level learned community being there.
2:20:02
Yeah, it's a great place just to be around people who are studying things
2:20:07
that you've never thought about before and you can chat with them and learn
2:20:10
something about owls or whatever it might be that they're studying.
2:20:17
That's been a lot of fun over the years.
2:20:19
I've always been very interested in biology, even though I
2:20:21
don't pursue it professionally.
2:20:23
It's fun to get chances to learn.
2:20:26
Now,
2:20:28
if you were going to, I'm going to merge three questions here: what aspects of
2:20:34
debris flows were well-understood in the 1980s when you were conceiving this, what
2:20:39
turned out to not be well-understood and taking specific examples going forward,
2:20:45
maybe some crystal moments, how has the flume helped build knowledge in that area?
2:20:52
Some really important moments for the record tell us why this is important
2:20:58
and what we've really learned from this.
2:21:00
I think
2:21:03
things that were relatively well-understood in the '80s had to
2:21:08
do with conditions under which debris flows initiate, and I don't mean it
2:21:14
at a high level of specificity, but everybody knew that there was certain
2:21:19
ranges of steep slopes and certain kinds of environments where debris
2:21:23
flows were more likely to occur.
2:21:26
They knew quite a bit about the sedimentological characteristics
2:21:29
of debris flow deposits and where they tended to occur, those kind of
2:21:34
broader geological framework topics.
2:21:39
What was really poorly understood had to do more with the mechanics of how do
2:21:43
these flows actually behave and what-
2:21:45
How they start, what's the saturation buildup, what's the
2:21:48
break point, that kind of thing?
2:21:49
Yeah and what controls how far and how fast they move.
2:21:53
People had always been fascinated by the fact that debris flows that are chock
2:21:58
full of rocks and in many cases logs and so forth and have sediment concentrations
2:22:03
up around 60% or 70% commonly can flow almost as fluidly as water.
2:22:14
Although on a conceptual level I think people realized that liquefaction
2:22:18
was part of that, there were no data whatsoever that really demonstrated that.
2:22:24
There were no models, mathematical models, that incorporated
2:22:28
that kind of understanding.
2:22:30
I think one of the real kind of breakthroughs at the flume, and this
2:22:34
happened within the first several years as soon as we start being able to make
2:22:38
good debris flows and collect decent data, our early measurements that showed that
2:22:45
you really did have these characteristic distributions of pore fluid pressure and
2:22:50
debris flows, where you had a coarse grain front that was high-friction and that it
2:22:55
was basically being pushed from behind by this liquefied body that had high pore
2:23:00
fluid pressures, we made measurements that actually demonstrated that and then
2:23:05
in addition kind of showed how you could incorporate that into mathematical models.
2:23:09
That was really important.
2:23:13
I think understanding exactly how grain size segregation occurs and how these
2:23:18
coarse-grained lateral levees form was really important because the levees
2:23:24
play such a role in directing exactly where the flow is going to go and
2:23:28
what areas are going to be impacted.
2:23:30
From a hazards perspective the levees are very, very important.
2:23:34
They're pervasive.
2:23:34
When you go out in the woods around here and if you're just kind of walking
2:23:40
around on something that looks like an alluvial fan, if you look hard enough,
2:23:45
you'll almost invariably find vestiges of the evidence of these linear assemblages
2:23:52
of boulders that go through the woods and you may ask yourself why are they there?
2:23:57
Why are these boulders lined up-
2:23:59
Some flow, some time, somewhere.
2:24:01
Yeah and they almost look as if they were placed there by humans.
2:24:03
No, they were placed there by some debris flow many, many years ago.
2:24:06
Now it's all grown up with vegetation and you don't really
2:24:09
see that other than the boulders.
2:24:10
But they're all over the place here in the northwest and in many other environments.
2:24:16
So, that was a real kind of eye-opening set of experiments
2:24:22
to understand that better.
2:24:24
The experiments we've done involving entrainment of bed material, that still
2:24:28
is the least understood part of this process, but we understand it a lot better
2:24:33
than we did before doing the experiments.
2:24:35
That's one though that there's still work to be done.
2:24:38
Yeah, quite a range of things.
2:24:41
What about the human applications in terms of whether through publications
2:24:47
or actual examples or sharing and what have you with planning in terms
2:24:53
of where you should build, where you shouldn't build, what safety mechanisms
2:24:57
need to be here if somebody has built or has a city or what have you?
2:25:02
We're really only now, and by now, I mean within the last 4 or 5 years,
2:25:08
reaching a state of fruition with this work where it's really starting
2:25:13
to impact ways that people can do practical hazard assessments.
2:25:20
The reason for that all has to do with development of this mathematical model,
2:25:24
which we call D-Claw, and that model development has been going on hand-in-hand
2:25:27
with all the flume experimentation for the last quarter century.
2:25:31
But the model has now reached a stage of fruition where we really feel like
2:25:35
we can apply it with some confidence as a prognostic tool and put those results
2:25:42
in the hands of planners and so forth.
2:25:44
In fact, we're doing a couple of projects right now, one of which relates to big
2:25:50
debris flows [lahars] that start as rock avalanches high on Mt. Rainier and
2:25:56
transform into debris flows that get down into the major river valleys on the west
2:26:01
side, the Nisqually Valley, the Puyallup Valley, and can travel up to 100 km
2:26:07
downstream and really impact populated areas and infrastructure and so forth.
2:26:12
We're doing that work right now.
2:26:15
We're doing some similar types of work but on a somewhat reduced scale related to a
2:26:22
hazard that exists in the town of Sisters, Oregon, which is downstream along Whychus
2:26:29
Creek, which has its headwaters up at Carver Lake, which is a moraine dam lake
2:26:34
on the east side of south Sister Volcano.
2:26:38
There's been concern for many years, going back to the 1980s,
2:26:43
that that moraine dam could breach up on Carver Lake, most likely
2:26:47
it would breach if there were a-
2:26:49
Is that right next to Three Creek Lake, or close?
2:26:52
It's close, yeah.
2:26:54
Okay.
2:26:57
Then there's evidence of past moraine dam breaches at some other locations
2:27:02
in the Three Sisters and this is one of the few places where there's
2:27:04
still a pretty good-sized lake that's perched at pretty high altitude.
2:27:07
So, that can come down and do significant damage in Sisters?
2:27:10
Yeah, well, there were some calculations, simple model calculations, done back
2:27:14
in the 1980s that basically predicted a rather catastrophic flood through
2:27:18
the town of Sisters as a result of breaching in this moraine dam.
2:27:21
Well, now because of our model, which is much, much more sophisticated than what
2:27:25
they had available in the '80s, we can do a much better job with that problem.
2:27:30
We've done simulations where we simulate a landslide coming down off south
2:27:34
Sister, entering the lake, causing a wave that overtops the moraine dam,
2:27:39
you then get a flood/debris flow that travels down that channel, hits
2:27:44
the alluvial fan above the town of Sisters and then starts spreading out.
2:27:49
What we found with our recent calculations is that the hazard to Sisters is probably
2:27:56
quite a bit, the town of Sisters, is quite a bit less than what was predicted
2:28:00
in the 1980s, mainly because we can now model the 3-dimensional spreading of
2:28:07
this flow, instead of assuming it's all going to go straight through town, which
2:28:12
is what they assumed back in the 1980s.
2:28:16
It's exciting, certainly exciting to me, to see all this work coming
2:28:21
to fruition in a way that allows us to give really useful information to
2:28:26
people who are tasked with planning and mitigation and those sorts of things.
2:28:30
I would guess that as the debris flume continues to do its work over time this
2:28:37
kind of dynamic will be more useful for practical human applications.
2:28:41
You were talking about the Chinese want to build one.
2:28:45
How has this served as a model that's actually either other flumes
2:28:51
in other countries have been built or in the United States, even?
2:28:54
Is this the only one in the U.S., though?
2:28:55
It's the only one in the United States.
2:28:56
Okay.
2:28:56
But like in Japan, have they built a bigger one?
2:28:59
No.
2:28:59
There's nothing that has superseded this.
2:29:02
Well, we've actually had quite a few groups come and visit us at Andrews to
2:29:07
tour the flume with the notion that they were going to build their own flume.
2:29:14
I think that after they saw what was involved and the scope of the effort and
2:29:18
so forth, they were all dissuaded from pursuing that idea, except for the Chinese
2:29:23
that now have construction underway of a flume that's going to be larger than ours.
2:29:26
It's not-
2:29:26
Of course [laughs]
2:29:28
. It's not going to-
2:29:29
Like their dam.
2:29:29
The one dam that's the biggest thing in the history of humanity.
2:29:31
Yeah, it's got to be the biggest.
2:29:33
I can't remember the name of it, but it's on the Yellow or the-
2:29:37
On the Yangtze River.
2:29:39
The Yangtze, right.
2:29:40
Yeah, the, is it the Three Gorges Dam?
2:29:44
I want to say the Three Gorges.
2:29:48
It makes Grand Coulee look like a-
2:29:51
Yeah.
2:29:52
And displacing a million people or something who live upstream.
2:29:56
You can do that in a dictatorship.
2:29:57
Yeah.
2:29:59
No NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act] involved.
2:30:01
No.
2:30:01
Same thing with building there-so their solution as they've got this
2:30:06
huge flume under construction, their solution for disposing of the sediment
2:30:10
when they're done with it is that their flume simply terminates into a river.
2:30:15
The idea is they're just going to dump all this sediment into the river and
2:30:18
let the river carry it away downstream.
2:30:20
How well do you think that will pass NEPA?
2:30:22
Not quite, huh?
2:30:23
Not very well.
2:30:24
No.
2:30:29
Tell me a little bit about the community dynamics of working
2:30:35
with people on the flume.
2:30:37
You talked about your original group of 3 and then, obviously, you
2:30:40
came to understand what an ideal size was for different sizes of
2:30:45
experiments and the labor necessary to do all the various facets.
2:30:49
Talk about that a little bit, but also talk about the community of doing
2:30:53
this and how do you learn to work with people and know them and tell
2:30:59
me how that's affected your life.
2:31:01
Well, the people aspect of working at the flume is a huge part of the endeavor,
2:31:06
because these experiments being of large scale, they necessarily require a crew.
2:31:10
It's by no means a one-person endeavor.
2:31:13
From the very beginning, my partner was Rick LeHusen, who did the
2:31:19
original brainstorming with me for how we're going to do this.
2:31:23
Once the flume was built, we gradually started adding people to the mix.
2:31:28
The next person to come on board was Tony Bequette, who was kind of a build it,
2:31:33
fix it, handyman kind of guy who helped with all kinds of important things.
2:31:39
Then, over the course of the next few years, for a while we had sort of a
2:31:42
stable five-person crew at the flume, and we did all of our experiments with
2:31:47
just those same 5 people, the additional two being Jon Major and Kevin Hadley.
2:31:52
Then we realized as we got into increasingly complex experiments that
2:31:57
were usually more labor-intensive that we needed even more help.
2:32:02
So, many, many people have rotated through at the flume over the years
2:32:06
and some of them many times over.
2:32:08
Certain people, Mark Reid comes to mind.
2:32:12
Jim Vallance, Roger Denlinger, they are people who've helped with this
2:32:18
probably tens of experiments there at the flume, or several tens of experiments.
2:32:23
Then there's a still larger group of people who might be there for just one
2:32:26
specific set of experiments because they have a particular interest, or they
2:32:30
might be a student or a volunteer who is interested in helping but is only
2:32:35
available for a relatively short time.
2:32:37
Most of the experiments we do nowadays are large enough and complex enough that we
2:32:42
typically have a crew of about 10 people.
2:32:46
It's quite a dynamic in terms of people engaged in all their individual
2:32:52
tasks simultaneously, but then trying to orchestrate the whole thing into,
2:32:56
it's like conducting a symphony or something, where you've got to make
2:33:00
sure the violins, you sort of entrust the violins to be doing the right
2:33:04
thing, but we've got to make sure the violins are in synch with the-
2:33:06
Cellos and the bass and the drums.
2:33:06
The people over here and the cellos and the, yeah exactly.
2:33:11
That's usually my job is to be that
2:33:16
sort of orchestrator.
2:33:16
It's worked remarkably well over the years.
2:33:19
Another interesting part of the dynamic, which I think really helps
2:33:24
from the standpoint of working together is we all live together
2:33:28
while we're there at the Andrews.
2:33:31
We're sharing an apartment, and you're cooking and eating with these people and
2:33:36
so in the evening you have time to-you can either talk science if you want
2:33:40
to or you can just completely unwind and drink your beer and play darts
2:33:46
or whatever it is you're going to do.
2:33:47
Sometimes you can even interact with other scientists and grad students
2:33:50
who are out in the Salt Salmon [building name] overhang, you know?
2:33:54
Exactly.
2:33:54
And the best times are when the weather is really nice in the summertime
2:33:58
and most people are outdoors in the evening and that's when you really get
2:34:01
a chance to interact and people aren't hunkered down inside their apartments.
2:34:09
The people dynamic is really important in any kind of group science endeavor, I
2:34:14
think, but probably particularly important in something like this where people have
2:34:19
to work collectively towards a common goal but are also doing their individual
2:34:27
things and it all has to come together and by and large that's worked out very well.
2:34:34
I should mention one other key person who just retired but who worked with
2:34:38
us for about 20 years at the flume.
2:34:40
His name is Matt Logan.
2:34:42
Matt has been my key right-hand man for 20 years and-
2:34:47
He's also up in Vancouver with you?
2:34:48
He's up in Vancouver.
2:34:49
Okay.
2:34:50
He has a skill set that ranges from digital photogrammetry to building stuff.
2:34:57
He's a master technician when it comes to fabricating equipment.
2:35:01
[He] can weld any kind of material and he's built countless
2:35:06
specialized devices for us that exist nowhere else in the world.
2:35:10
He's essentially an inventor.
2:35:11
He'll take an idea of saying this is what we want to do.
2:35:14
We want to contain sediment in the following way.
2:35:18
He'll figure out how to build it and make it work.
2:35:21
He's your Leonardo, right?
2:35:22
Yeah.
2:35:24
Having somebody like that is incredibly helpful at a facility like the flume.
2:35:30
What were some of the biggest surprises scientifically that have occurred at
2:35:35
the flume or disasters or funny events or things that went weird and wrong?
2:35:41
Just start out with the surprises scientifically.
2:35:45
Well, I can think of-one of the more interesting, counter-intuitive
2:35:50
things we found at the
2:35:53
flume is that when we roughened the bed of the flume-so this, again, prior to
2:35:56
the year 2000, the bed of the flume was just smooth, broom-finished concrete.
2:36:01
Then we surfaced it with these bumps which make the bottom of the flume kind
2:36:06
of look like the bottom of an egg carton, that kind of rough, textured surface
2:36:10
with sort of similar amplitude bumps.
2:36:14
Intuitively you would think that okay you increase the roughness so drastically.
2:36:20
Surely the flows won't go as far.
2:36:23
But in fact, what happened after we put in the bumpy bed is that our
2:36:26
debris flows actually ran out farther than they did with the smooth bed.
2:36:31
The reason for that had to do with the fact that the bumpy bed increased
2:36:36
the efficiency of the grain size segregation process, which in turn
2:36:41
increased the efficiency of the flow in building these lateral levies
2:36:45
that confine it once it starts running out at the foot of the flume.
2:36:49
As long as the flow is self-confining, it's able to just kind of keep its
2:36:54
longitudinal momentum going and it runs out a farther distance than if
2:36:58
it spreads out laterally and so with a smoother bed there would always
2:37:02
be more lateral spreading of the deposits, simply because the levee
2:37:05
development wasn't as pronounced.
2:37:07
So, some really counter-intuitive things like that.
2:37:12
In terms of
2:37:15
sort of funny or unexpected things, I guess what I think of-
2:37:19
Well, the first thing, number one-
2:37:22
Oh, yeah, yeah, our first-
2:37:23
It wasn't very funny, though, when you were cleaning it out.
2:37:24
Well, I was going to say most of these are the sorts of things
2:37:27
that are only funny in retrospect.
2:37:29
Like shoveling the pea gravel out was not funny at the time.
2:37:32
Yeah, moving 20 km3 of moist pea-gravel by hand, yeah, that was not funny at
2:37:37
the time, but it is retrospectively.
2:37:40
Another event kind of along those same lines, well, a
2:37:44
couple of things I can think of.
2:37:47
One is that
2:37:51
one of our very first experiments, in fact, it could have been
2:37:54
the first experiment that we did where we ran a water flood
2:37:59
across an erodible sediment bed.
2:38:01
So, we've lined the bed of the flume with sediment, discharged
2:38:04
6 km3 of water on top of it, the question is what's going to happen?
2:38:10
In the first one of these experiments out in the distal part of our runout pad,
2:38:13
we had an individual, Roger's his name, who had a video camera set up out there.
2:38:21
His job was to film this flow coming down the flume toward him.
2:38:26
I think because he was viewing it through the viewfinder of the video camera and
2:38:30
not doing it in person, he didn't fully appreciate how fast it was coming and
2:38:36
how rapidly it was approaching him.
2:38:38
Anyway, he got overrun by the flow.
2:38:41
It's the only time we've ever had that happen; somebody get overrun by a flow.
2:38:44
Was it funny or scary or both?
2:38:46
At the time it was scary.
2:38:47
It was scary because it knocked him down.
2:38:50
It covered him with mud and debris and so forth.
2:38:54
He wasn't injured by the impact, but in the process of this he was wearing
2:39:01
glasses and his glasses got broken and he got a piece of glass in his eye,
2:39:05
or several pieces of glass in his eye.
2:39:08
It was bad enough I took him down to the hospital in Springfield.
2:39:13
Luckily, they were able to get the glass out without too much difficulty.
2:39:16
But it was pretty scary at the time because his eye, you know,
2:39:22
you don't want to have something like that happen to your eyes.
2:39:23
So, this is the only real accident in the history of the flume?
2:39:26
That's the worst accident.
2:39:27
Oh, okay.
2:39:27
There had been a lot of really minor accidents.
2:39:30
You know, the-
2:39:31
Slipping on the flume when trying to-
2:39:33
The skinned knee.
2:39:36
The smashed thumb or whatever, but nothing that has seemed, well, there
2:39:42
was one other incident that was scary that also seemed potentially lethal.
2:39:47
In fact, even more so.
2:39:50
This was probably 15 years ago, something like that.
2:39:56
We were in the process of setting up an experiment.
2:39:58
It
2:40:01
was just sort of a standard debris flow experiment, where we'd open the gates
2:40:04
and let the flow go, no erodible bed.
2:40:11
It was getting close to the time to release the flow, so the
2:40:14
sediment was charged with water.
2:40:16
It was completely saturated.
2:40:20
One of the folks who was working there, she later worked on a lot
2:40:24
of experiments, but she was a relative neophyte at this time.
2:40:28
She climbed into the flume 32 m downslope from the gate in
2:40:35
order to make a final adjustment.
2:40:36
I think what she was doing was cleaning the, there's a glass protective plate
2:40:40
beneath the laser, and it was splattered with mud and she was just going in
2:40:44
to clean the mud off, make sure there was a good, clear view for the laser.
2:40:49
For very mysterious reasons that we still don't completely understand other
2:40:54
than clearly there was a voltage leak somewhere, the gate spontaneously opened.
2:40:59
It's the only time it's ever done that.
2:41:01
Because the gate has sort of a failsafe mechanism on it, but in this case,
2:41:08
the failsafe in the sense that it has to be engaged in two separate places.
2:41:13
In this case, the primary initial engagement had already taken place and so
2:41:18
it was just waiting for the final trigger.
2:41:21
Somehow there was a voltage leak in the system that was enough to very,
2:41:25
very slowly power the hydraulic pump that withdraws the latch mechanism.
2:41:31
But it was so slow that you couldn't hear it.
2:41:35
Normally when that pump grinds you can hear it [grinding noises] grinding away.
2:41:38
Get out of the way!
2:41:38
Right?
2:41:40
But this time you couldn't hear it and just all of a sudden, the gates open.
2:41:44
So, here's now this debris flow bearing down on this woman who's only 30 m away.
2:41:48
In the flume?
2:41:49
In the flume.
2:41:50
She fortunately had been there enough at that time that she knew
2:41:54
exactly what was going on and she just deftly hopped over the side wall
2:41:58
just before the flow came past and-
2:42:01
That could have really hurt her.
2:42:02
Well, it could have killed her, could have killed her because it would've knocked
2:42:06
her down and probably dragged her the length of the flume on bumpy concrete.
2:42:11
And she didn't have a helmet on, did she?
2:42:13
Well, and that wouldn't have helped in that circumstance, anyway.
2:42:16
So, that begs the question how easy is it to get insurance for the work up there?
2:42:26
You know it's a federal facility and the federal government
2:42:28
doesn't insure anything.
2:42:32
Self-insured as they say, which basically means no insurance.
2:42:35
Yeah,
2:42:38
so we've hit some scary, scary things like that.
2:42:41
Those two are definitely the most scary.
2:42:45
There was one other one that was scary, only to me, and it turns out it was
2:42:48
just a joke that they played on me.
2:42:50
Over the years we've quite a few film crews and stuff most of whom have
2:42:56
done, well, they range from those who are quite sophisticated and very
2:43:04
focused on creating a good educational film, people from NOVA for example.
2:43:10
At the other end people who are there just to have something dramatic that
2:43:15
they can flash on the screen and they don't care at all about the science.
2:43:18
Especially in the modern day where everybody's got a
2:43:20
YouTube of everything else.
2:43:22
In one of these other kinds of film crew episodes, they had shown up and
2:43:28
they brought this-I can't remember this girl's name, but she was a child star.
2:43:32
She had her own TV program on cable TV or something where you know it was let's
2:43:39
go touring with Susie, or whatever her name was, and we're going to go all
2:43:44
around the world and look at all kinds of crazy stuff and she'll tell us about it.
2:43:48
So here they are at the debris flow flume and she's acting as the master of
2:43:52
ceremonies for the camera and telling them what's going on with the flume.
2:43:56
Well, unbeknownst to me, so I'm up working at the top of the flume.
2:44:00
Traditionally when we release the flows I'm always at the top of the flume and
2:44:03
I'm the one who triggers the release.
2:44:07
I'm busy doing stuff up there, not paying much attention to
2:44:09
what's going on down there.
2:44:12
This film crew thought it would be funny if they brought with
2:44:15
them a mannequin and to have this mannequin overrun by the flow.
2:44:24
So, I'm up there doing my thing and time comes to release the flow
2:44:32
and we release it and I look down the flume and here apparently is
2:44:36
this human being standing like-
2:44:37
You didn't know it was a mannequin?
2:44:38
No, and like right in the path of the flow.
2:44:41
I just scream bloody murder.
2:44:44
I thought it was this little girl, this child star who was
2:44:47
just standing there or something.
2:44:49
They thought it was a big joke, but at the time it didn't seem very funny.
2:44:53
I bet you were not pleased.
2:44:54
No, I was not pleased.
2:44:55
I didn't think it was very funny.
2:44:57
They were a real nuisance to have around, anyway, that crew.
2:45:00
They were just in our way.
2:45:01
Now, have you been there for every experiment?
2:45:04
I missed one, back I can't remember what year it was.
2:45:08
What did you say on the chart, the graphic of-163?
2:45:10
163.
2:45:10
163, right.
2:45:13
Over 27 years?
2:45:14
26 years.
2:45:16
26 years.
2:45:16
About 5 ½ a year, 6 a year about the average?
2:45:21
Per year?
2:45:22
Yeah.
2:45:23
Well, no more like 10 a year.
2:45:25
No, I mean 10 a year, excuse me.
2:45:26
No, no actually if you divide-
2:45:28
No, wait a minute.
2:45:28
That doesn't make sense.
2:45:29
27 years-no, that's about 6.
2:45:31
Yeah, I guess it has been more like 6 a year.
2:45:33
That's why-
2:45:34
I'm surprised the number is that small.
2:45:35
I did the math in my head last night.
2:45:36
I thought was I not thinking straight?
2:45:38
So, anyway.
2:45:39
No, no, yeah.
2:45:40
You're right.
2:45:41
About 6 a year.
2:45:42
Okay.
2:45:43
But you only missed 1, huh?
2:45:44
Missed 1.
2:45:45
I can't remember what the circumstance was, why I wasn't there.
2:45:47
I was at a meeting or something.
2:45:50
Now, how has doing this work and not only the visual and experiential aspects
2:45:56
of it, but the science and the modeling and the building on knowledge and going
2:46:00
from that-how has that affected how you now go out and see real-life examples
2:46:05
during the course of your career as you know almost 30 years of this?
2:46:09
Describe that dynamic, the back-and-forth between the model
2:46:12
and the flume and real-life stuff.
2:46:15
Well, I have to say that when I go out now and look at real debris flows, whether
2:46:20
they're in progress, which that's an opportunity you don't get very often.
2:46:23
More often what you see is the aftermath, the deposits and so forth.
2:46:27
I really do feel that I have a very complete understanding of what happened.
2:46:33
Now, partly that's written up in papers and documented with data
2:46:39
and calculations and so forth.
2:46:42
But partly it's just a, it's a very sort of visceral level understanding because
2:46:46
I've watched so many of these things.
2:46:48
I've been a firsthand observer to 160 roughly of these debris flows
2:46:55
in different circumstances, whether they're impacting barriers or flowing
2:46:59
around corners or running up against slopes and whether they're initiating
2:47:03
or whether they're entraining sediment.
2:47:05
I've been able to witness this all with my own eyes in real time and
2:47:10
there's no substitute for that in terms of giving you a strong, intuitive
2:47:16
impression as to what's going on.
2:47:20
I think maybe people think that I've got a lot of hubris if I go
2:47:24
out to the field and I say I think I know exactly what happened here.
2:47:30
But what they don't realize is that-
2:47:32
Because of your long experience looking.
2:47:33
The reason is that I've got a lot of experience looking at this stuff
2:47:36
when it's actually happening and not just looking at the deposits.
2:47:41
Have you seen an actual, live, massive volcanic or other event that has
2:47:46
happened during your whole time or has it always been in retrospect or
2:47:49
through or video or something else?
2:47:51
I've seen small debris flows, plenty of small debris flows.
2:47:54
I've never personally witnessed a really big one.
2:48:00
I have colleagues who have, who for example were at Pinatubo not
2:48:05
long after the eruption, and there were recurrent, big debris flows.
2:48:09
There was lahars that covered the whole area, right?
2:48:12
Right, yeah.
2:48:13
But I mean fortunately nowadays video documentation of things tends to be so
2:48:21
much, there's so much of it available.
2:48:23
It's actually spectacular what you can find nowadays, if you go online and
2:48:28
just Google name your hazard, you know?
2:48:31
Type in high-speed landslide video.
2:48:34
You'll get 50 hits of stuff from Europe and China and wherever it might be.
2:48:41
Usually it's not been done by scientists, it's done by people who
2:48:45
just accidently happen to be there when it happens, and they've got
2:48:48
their handy smartphone with them or whatever and they shoot video of it.
2:48:51
Kind of a,
2:48:54
maybe not, well related loosely-but tsunamis.
2:48:58
Yeah.
2:48:59
Watching the 2004 Andaman fault one.
2:49:03
Then Tohoku.
2:49:04
Then Tohoku
2:49:07
debris flow of oceanic origin.
2:49:10
Tell me a little bit about that.
2:49:13
Well, actually there's a strong synergy I think between understanding how debris
2:49:18
flows work and understanding how tsunamis operate once they've made landfall and
2:49:25
they're now picking up lots of debris.
2:49:27
That was my point, yeah.
2:49:28
Because the leading edge, that's so striking in the videos, both of Tohoku and
2:49:34
from the Sumatra and Andaman tsunami that once they make landfall if there's debris
2:49:41
around-if there are trees, if they're cars, whatever happens to be in their
2:49:45
path-it will get picked up and it will get shoved along in front of the flow.
2:49:50
I really think that the mechanics of tsunamis making landfall like
2:49:55
that need to be modeled more like the way we model debris flows and
2:49:59
I've talked with tsunamis modelers about that and they basically agree.
2:50:02
I think we have the mathematical architecture in place for doing that,
2:50:07
but it hasn't actually been done yet.
2:50:09
I'm hoping it is done.
2:50:11
I would like to live to see it done, even though that's probably not work
2:50:15
that I'll do myself, because I think we have all the pieces in place to do that.
2:50:20
Certainly, it's an important phenomenon, right here on the Oregon and Washington
2:50:25
coast to say nothing of around the world.
2:50:27
Well, my wife is from Peru.
2:50:30
They have tsunamis and earthquakes there and we are slowly putting together our
2:50:35
Cascadia subduction zone emergency kit.
2:50:38
Emergency kit, yeah.
2:50:38
It's not finished yet, but-
2:50:40
It's good to be thinking about because-
2:50:43
Well, 1700 it did happen.
2:50:44
And we all-
2:50:46
What was it they figure?
2:50:46
It was a 9 about?
2:50:47
Roughly 9 yeah.
2:50:50
There's like debris evidence way up the river channels.
2:50:54
Oh yeah.
2:50:55
I mean, like, 30, 40 miles, right?
2:50:57
In some cases?
2:50:57
Well, I think-
2:50:59
Or is that too far?
2:51:01
I think in the Columbia River there's evidence of tsunami backwash.
2:51:07
I'm not talking about a huge wave, but there's evidence that the river flow
2:51:11
was influenced all the way back to where Bonneville Dam is today, and of course
2:51:16
that's where there used to be rapids.
2:51:18
That's where the old Cascades Rapids were.
2:51:20
Right.
2:51:21
So, the river felt the effect of that tsunami all the way
2:51:24
upstream to the first big rapids.
2:51:29
What is the expected longevity of this debris flow flume and what repairs are
2:51:34
typical of a year or every other year?
2:51:37
Really, it's lasted longer, I think, than we ever expected it to.
2:51:40
I didn't really expect that it would still be fully functional
2:51:44
probably 27 years after we built it, or 26 years after we built it.
2:51:50
But the concrete, the basic concrete structure has held up remarkably well.
2:51:55
The only things that have needed attention over the years are usually
2:51:58
places where we've monkeyed with things and we've put in new concrete
2:52:02
patches or something of that sort.
2:52:04
I think that as long as it receives a small amount of regular
2:52:10
maintenance and, again, the concrete doesn't need much maintenance
2:52:13
other than occasional cleaning.
2:52:15
But painting the metal parts, keeping the plumbing [there's a lot of
2:52:20
plumbing at the flume, a lot of plastic pipe, a lot of pumps and so forth.
2:52:25
The plumbing needs to be maintained].
2:52:27
But it's all pretty inexpensive stuff, normally.
2:52:33
Just kind of like maintaining a house, you just got to kind of
2:52:36
chipping away at it over time.
2:52:40
Do you think it will be here in 25 years?
2:52:42
I would like to believe it will be.
2:52:44
Why wouldn't it be?
2:52:45
Why wouldn't it be?
2:52:46
As long as people continue to have interest in using it.
2:52:48
That's the key thing.
2:52:50
Interest and the willingness and dedication to put the effort
2:52:55
into it to actually do it.
2:52:56
Now, if you had an unlimited budget and a wish list, what would be your
2:53:01
expansion, extension, or improvement on the debris flume if you had a, oh
2:53:05
let's build another one somewhere else.
2:53:07
Just give me an idealized vision.
2:53:09
Well, at the Andrews, if I had an unlimited budget, what I would change
2:53:18
about the existing facility is it would frankly be nice to put-particularly up
2:53:23
at the time of the flume-it'd be nice to put a roof over the whole thing so that
2:53:28
it was more protected from the weather.
2:53:30
Mainly because of the electronics you're talking about.
2:53:31
Well, electronics and also the whole process of getting the gate
2:53:34
sealed and everything and trying to maintain a water balance.
2:53:38
Our biggest problems with rain are up at the top of the flume and the
2:53:43
work we're trying to do up there.
2:53:45
So, if we had a roof over the whole thing that would be great.
2:53:49
If I had to build it over again, there'd be a few things I would tweak
2:53:55
with regard to the geometry and so on.
2:54:00
Currently the flume slopes uniformly throughout almost all of its length
2:54:04
at about 31° and then fairly quickly it transitions through a curve, a
2:54:07
catenary curve to about 2° slope.
2:54:10
I would broaden out that transition so that the change in slope angle is less
2:54:15
abrupt and a little bit more like it would be in a natural alluvial fan setting.
2:54:21
I would probably change some things about the configuration of the hopper
2:54:24
area up at the top of the flume so that it made it easier to use more sediment
2:54:30
and get it wet without worrying about the sediment failing prematurely,
2:54:35
because that's been a problem.
2:54:36
Particularly in the early years it was a problem.
2:54:40
I'd change some aspects of the plumbing system.
2:54:43
Now,
2:54:46
if I really had unlimited money and we're doing it all over again, but this gets
2:54:51
into a whole other order of magnitude, it'd be nice to have a variable slope.
2:54:56
But, of course, when you're talking about something of this scale
2:54:59
and this weight, variable slope becomes a very non-trivial thing.
2:55:05
You're now talking about you know something more like building an
2:55:09
aircraft carrier or something.
2:55:12
Really big, yeah.
2:55:14
How would this react differently, or not, in like for instance a desert climate?
2:55:21
Would the difference on drag or anything else be negligible or would it mean you
2:55:27
have less worry about rain and weather in terms of your saturation process?
2:55:30
Yeah, I don't think it would change much about the behavior of the flows.
2:55:34
It would be a lot more challenging to come by all the water we
2:55:37
need to do the experiments.
2:55:40
But the actual character of the flows themselves, I don't
2:55:44
anticipate they would change much.
2:55:47
What would you say is the most satisfying aspect of having hatched
2:55:49
this idea and seeing its successful operation for 30 years almost?
2:55:55
To me the most satisfying thing is the synergy that the flume work has had with
2:56:01
the development of the mathematical model.
2:56:03
That was really the single, biggest motivation for building the flume was we
2:56:10
needed data to better inform development that would improve mathematical models
2:56:16
and then to aid in testing that model.
2:56:18
Now we actually have that model and it's good enough and complete enough
2:56:23
at this point that we're actually using it for practical problems.
2:56:27
Our hope is that in the fairly near future it will become widely available.
2:56:32
Meaning, we'll have some user-friendly interface for it
2:56:35
that will make it accessible to a much wider group of people.
2:56:39
Currently it's arcane enough-running the model's sufficiently arcane that
2:56:44
we're the only ones who can use it.
2:56:46
But we hope to change that.
2:56:47
Now, a couple retrospectives and then-so,
2:56:55
how would you view the debris flume's most important contribution
2:56:58
to science and society and more philosophically its legacy.
2:57:02
If you want to cite a couple papers or chapters in books or what have
2:57:07
you-you might want to throw that into that retrospective question, too.
2:57:11
Okay.
2:57:14
I would say the most important contribution of the flume scientifically,
2:57:19
which in a sense is also its most important societal contribution, is
2:57:24
just the way it's provided reproducible,
2:57:30
sort of incontrovertible data that has informed development of a new
2:57:35
generation of mathematical models, not only our own model but models
2:57:39
developed by other people as well.
2:57:41
There are a large number of people now around the world who are using the same
2:57:45
basic conceptual framework for building their model that really was initially
2:57:51
informed by data from our flume.
2:57:54
Since that time there have been more supporting data coming from other sources,
2:57:57
but our flume was really the first to establish a framework for thinking about
2:58:02
the role of evolving pore pressures and grain segregation and so forth.
2:58:08
I think that was really important and the fact that those models are used
2:58:11
for practical purposes that inform hazard assessments and so on that's
2:58:17
where the societal connection comes in.
2:58:21
In terms of how that pertains to things we've published over the years; I
2:58:27
mean probably the most single important paper that I've ever written
2:58:31
was published way back in 1997.
2:58:33
When you told me about the original important thing that
2:58:36
came out of this, correct?
2:58:37
Exactly.
2:58:38
That was based in considerable part on those first several years of experiments
2:58:43
at the flume, where unsurprisingly we were learning things rapidly
2:58:47
during those first several years.
2:58:48
The pace has maybe slowed down somewhat over time.
2:58:51
We're refining things at this point, but I wrote a paper back then that just
2:58:55
had the broad title, "The Physics of Debris Flows." In it I tried to lay out
2:59:00
all the empirical evidence as well as a theoretical, mathematical structure
2:59:07
for how to represent the basic mechanics of debris flows, how do you model them.
2:59:15
A lot of people have bought in to that since that time.
2:59:19
That paper has been cited about 2,000 times at this point and it's a pretty
2:59:25
widely acknowledged way of thinking about the problem at this point, but
2:59:31
it was not true at all prior to that.
2:59:34
A lot of our successive work has kind of built on that.
2:59:40
Certainly, the work on grain size segregation, work on runout processes and
2:59:46
so on-it all feeds back into continuing to refine these sort of prognostic
2:59:53
tools, the mathematical models and so on.
2:59:57
Now, retrospectively how would you describe the impact of the debris flow
3:00:02
flume, its operations, its findings on your research career and life?
3:00:07
Well, I didn't really anticipate at the time we built the flume back in 1991
3:00:13
but it became the central element of my research career in the sense that
3:00:22
it guided the modeling work I did.
3:00:25
It provided all sorts of evidence that inform my research as
3:00:29
well as that of other people.
3:00:33
I've sometimes asked myself the question in the absence of the flume
3:00:36
if we'd never built it, what would the trajectory of my career have been?
3:00:41
It's a non-answerable question.
3:00:44
But chances are it would have been very, very different.
3:00:48
I could well imagine that I would've continued working on
3:00:50
mathematical models, but they wouldn't have been as well-informed.
3:00:55
They would've been more speculative and, who knows, it might have branched
3:00:58
off in an entirely different direction.
3:01:01
So, yeah, it's been very much a central organizing force in terms of guiding
3:01:08
my career, which has in turn has been a central part of my whole life trajectory.
3:01:14
I assume that being with the USGS for basically your whole career has been a
3:01:21
very satisfying and a good place for you?
3:01:24
Yeah, I'd say it's become increasingly satisfying over the years in the sense
3:01:28
that there was certainly a time when I thought I would leave the USGS to
3:01:31
take an academic job because I do enjoy teaching and I always wanted to teach.
3:01:37
But when our USGS work has become more satisfying as we've increasingly been
3:01:44
able to apply it to practical problems and to see our methods used around the
3:01:50
world by other people and something I didn't mention earlier in our interview
3:01:56
is along the way we developed this relatively simple statistically-based
3:02:01
way of forecasting debris flow inundation areas and that gets used all around
3:02:06
the world in a lot of third-world countries and so forth where people
3:02:09
don't have very many resources and they're really not equipped to run
3:02:13
fancy computer simulations and so on.
3:02:16
But, the simple statistically based methodology, which was
3:02:19
informed by the flume work,
3:02:23
is used all over the place.
3:02:24
It's gratifying to know that you've been able to have an impact on people
3:02:31
you've never met and never will meet.
3:02:34
And maybe some lives have been saved because of that.
3:02:35
Possibly, possibly, yeah.
3:02:38
That's a pretty good legacy, I think.
3:02:40
Yeah.
3:02:42
Anything else that you'd like to add that we didn't cover, Dick,
3:02:46
just in the last few minutes we have left here that maybe I didn't
3:02:49
mention or maybe that comes to mind?
3:02:51
I don't know.
3:02:51
I feel like, no not really.
3:02:54
Nothing that's nagging at me that I feel didn't get covered.
3:02:57
This has been a pretty comprehensive interview.
3:02:59
Yeah.
3:03:00
Anyway, I want to thank you for your time.
3:03:02
Yeah, well thank you.
3:03:03
I've enjoyed it very much, both meeting you last night.
3:03:05
I appreciate you doing it.
3:03:06
Anyway.
3:03:07
Will this ultimately be edited- [recording cuts off]
