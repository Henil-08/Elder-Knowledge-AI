00:03
Good afternoon, this is Dr. Samuel J. Schmeiding,
00:07
College of Forestry.
00:09
It is July 31, 2015.
00:15
I am here with Lynn Burditt, Area Manager for the Columbia Gorge
00:19
National Scenic Recreation Area?
00:21
No, just Scenic Area.
00:23
Scenic Area, excuse me.
00:25
And we are at the Ryan Lake, which is part of the Mount St.
00:29
Helens National Volcanic Monument.
00:32
We are going to do a little unique approach to this oral history interview
00:35
today, where we are going to be talking about her experience with
00:38
Mount St. Helens, and we are going to be doing it at various locations
00:41
on a certain side of the monument.
00:44
I want to thank you, Lynn, for being willing to do this today.
00:46
How are you?
00:47
I am doing great today, thank you.
00:49
Excellent.
00:50
So, let me talk about, let’s just go real quick—tell me just a little
00:56
bit about your biography and how you got into your work as a land
00:59
manager and natural resource manager.
01:03
Well, I grew up in Eastern Tennessee near the Smoky Mountains.
01:07
I have a degree in Outdoor Recreation Resource Management and master’s
01:12
degree in Forestry and a master’s degree in Conflict Resolution.
01:17
As a young person, I don’t know how I decided I wanted to be
01:24
in land management.
01:25
I know I must have intentionally decided because I started college at
01:27
the College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse University.
01:32
However, I do not even recall being driven about that.
01:38
What I remember as a young person was having the great opportunity to
01:43
be outdoors in a lot of situations.
01:45
I was a Camp Fire Girl.
01:47
We had leaders who would take us out on river events on hikes and we were
01:54
always experiencing the Smokey Mountains.
01:56
I also grew up during the era of the late ‘50s, early ‘60s when a lot of
02:03
environmental activism was going on.
02:06
A number of the current laws were passed.
02:10
I vividly remember the Cuyahoga River catching fire and that
02:15
getting notice and just having the whole concept of environmental
02:20
concerns be in the forefront for me.
02:23
What was your family like regarding the outdoors, nature, their beliefs and
02:28
philosophy about the land, nature, etc.?
02:34
We would spend time outdoors.
02:36
We would go to the Smokys.
02:38
We would actually have picnics and different things.
02:42
My dad happened to work for the plants at Oak Ridge.
02:48
He worked for Y-12 and to be honest I had no idea what he
02:52
did until after he retired.
02:54
I thought everybody was like that.
02:57
But my parents were, I consider them pretty environmentally oriented.
03:03
They also were very open-minded in the idea that as a young
03:06
woman in that day and time
03:11
they took the presumption that I could do whatever I wanted to do.
03:14
They encouraged that.
03:15
They encouraged those kinds of activities.
03:17
My
03:19
sense of them is that they were relatively liberal in their politics.
03:23
They were both involved with the Democratic program, worked
03:27
for Al Gore, Sr.’s activities.
03:31
I don’t really recall a lot around the environmental front, other than
03:36
we all grew up in that kind of arena and valuing these kinds of things.
03:44
Do you have a favorite place?
03:47
A favorite place.
03:49
In nature.
03:50
I have many, many, many favorite places.
03:54
One of the really great things about working for the Forest Service,
03:57
whenever I get to a place, I love it.
04:00
I don’t like moving.
04:01
I get settled in, and, if I was to pick one favorite place,
04:07
well, I’m going to pick two.
04:09
The Bob Marshall [Wilderness Area] is one of my favorite places over in Montana.
04:13
I love the Rocky Mountains and the way they just are there and
04:16
it’s a presence that I miss.
04:19
That said, one of my other favorite places is Mount St. Helens.
04:24
Just because of having the opportunity to work here shortly after the eruption
04:30
and being part of that living landscape it viscerally became part of me.
04:36
So, if I had to narrow down and pick favorite places, those would be two.
04:42
I just love every place I get the opportunity to be a
04:45
part of and be in service.
04:49
Now, what do you remember about volcanoes and volcanism, let’s say from books
04:54
you read, or a movie, or a piece of art that you saw where it represented
04:59
a certain vision of what volcanos were represented to be and maybe something
05:05
that was imparted to you maybe long, obviously, before Mount St. Helens?
05:13
That’s a great question.
05:14
As I think back on it, it would probably be those images that you
05:18
might see more drawn pictures, where somebody would draw a mountain and
05:26
then show fire and different things.
05:31
It was sort of that image where say the stories like Bridge
05:36
of the Gods, those legends.
05:38
It was things where the gods were fighting, and it was this way of telling
05:44
a story about whether it’s nature or somebody being angry in many ways.
05:53
Those are probably the bits and pieces I recall.
05:56
It was a mythological kind of conception?
06:01
Correct.
06:02
In college I took a geography class and what I remember from that, you’d
06:07
think you remember things like volcanos.
06:10
But what I recollect was how it helped me learn that in many ways during the Civil
06:16
War there was no way the South would ever win the war just based on the way the
06:20
geography and geology the landscape was.
06:24
I couldn’t tell you today why that was, but I very much
06:28
remember that take-home message.
06:31
I
06:35
don’t recall learning a lot.
06:36
I grew up in the East.
06:36
I don’t recall learning a lot about volcanos.
06:38
It was really more that ____ [Sam interrupts]
06:39
. Well, I mean the Appalachians are very old, weathered mountains and if they had
06:45
an era of volcanism it was 500 million years ago or before Paleozoic or before.
06:51
Yeah.
06:52
So, we’ll just throw in my own perspective for the record.
06:58
The first one I remembered was a Tarzan movie, a Johnny Weissmuller
07:02
movie, a black-and-white where they had some corny special effects and
07:07
lava flowing down and taking away some person that was trying to kill Tarzan.
07:14
Anyway, I remember that.
07:15
I may have watched that movie.
07:17
Then there was Parícutin in Mexico.
07:20
I remember that and then the Hawaii volcanoes.
07:22
That was my image of a volcano, which was not what you see what happened here.
07:30
Correct.
07:30
The conception of volcanos was simplistic, just like a lot of people have a
07:34
very corny view of what a tsunami is.
07:39
It’s not like a big wave, like a 100-ft bonsai pipeline wave.
07:45
It’s a series of surges, but we’ve been taught through images and obviously,
07:51
interesting enough, the first image I saw was an artist’s rendition in
07:56
a book for children of Krakatoa’s eruption produced 100-ft tsunamis.
08:01
Right.
08:02
But the pictures they showed was a bunch of scared, native peoples
08:05
running from the tsunami, but it looked like a gigantic breaker that you’d
08:09
see on Hawaii’s north shore, rather than what it probably actually was.
08:14
That’s how we translate things.
08:15
Right, exactly.
08:20
Now, Mount St. Helens—where were you when it started to get angry in March 1980.
08:30
At that time, I was in graduate school at Oregon State University.
08:34
I was a Forest Service employee doing an advanced technical training program.
08:43
Actually, in March I may have been on a detail.
08:46
As part of that program I got to do one-month details to
08:51
various places in the country.
08:53
I’m not totally sure that I was in Corvallis in March, but
08:57
that’s where my assignment was.
09:01
What do you remember about [what] you said, oh my goodness, this
09:04
thing is starting to wake up!
09:07
You know, the interesting piece with that is, I probably was aware of it,
09:13
noticing it, definitely the politics of it whereas more and more interest came in.
09:21
I remember Dixie Lee Ray was the governor and the challenges as they started
09:25
limiting who can be in various places
09:31
and
09:34
just Dixie Lee Ray, as the type of governor who she was, was sort of one of
09:40
the interesting pieces of memory for me as I probably remember more about her than
09:46
I do about the evolution of the volcano.
09:50
Describe that.
09:53
It’s far enough away now that some of my memories are vague.
09:58
But it was during the time when there was a lot of effort around the
10:05
idea of putting in nuclear energy, the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant.
10:10
She was a big leader in that and pushing it.
10:13
There were a lot of concerns and issues around that.
10:18
Just the way in which she was choosing to be governor and choosing to put
10:25
forward her vision was really a present thing for me, and then, of course,
10:33
the idea of, as a volcano’s awakening and you have nuclear power plants,
10:39
or the concept of them, nearby, there was just an interesting juxtaposition.
10:44
Interesting.
10:45
She was kind of a brash person.
10:47
She was a former academic.
10:49
Yeah.
10:50
With a Ph.D. in engineering.
10:52
Something like that.
10:53
Something like that, yeah.
10:54
I think so.
10:57
Now, it erupts.
10:59
The big one: May 18, 1980.
11:02
Where were you when it erupted?
11:05
I was at my apartment in Corvallis.
11:09
I lived in a duplex on 15th Avenue, somewhere northwest.
11:13
I have to admit
11:16
that I was asleep, and it woke me up.
11:21
I mean, what woke you up?
11:23
What did you hear?
11:24
What I recollect waking up on, I have this vague image that it threw me out
11:30
of bed or something, which is not true, but it was like a giant sonic boom.
11:39
I didn’t know what had actually occurred.
11:42
It sort of was what I recollect, and I could be making this up, as that effect of
11:50
a sonic boom, but that it actually shook.
11:52
More than just sound was movement.
11:57
Well, the sound waves apparently bounced off the stratosphere, jumped Portland,
12:02
but hit the middle and southern Willamette Valley, so we heard it in Eugene also.
12:10
Now, but how long did it take you to find out what happened?
12:14
It was later that morning.
12:17
I wasn’t a big TV watcher and it didn’t strike me.
12:22
I think it didn’t occur to me that it would be connected to Mount St. Helens.
12:28
I kind of was just going about my day and it was probably later I’m not sure
12:32
if a friend called me or if I turned on the news or what-not, but it was
12:37
definitely later in the day when I learned what had actually occurred.
12:42
What do you remember seeing on the news and the images?
12:48
Part of what I recollect on all of that is, one, is I had previously worked for
12:55
the Forest Service on the Clearwater National Forest out of Potlatch, Idaho.
13:00
I had lived over in western Idaho, eastern Washington and I had a number of friends
13:06
who were still there, and ash was going there, and they experienced that midnight
13:13
[during the day] kind of a factor.
13:15
They got dumped really heavy.
13:16
They got seriously dumped.
13:17
Like Ritzville, I remember reading they got 7 in.
13:21
of ash and 2, 3, 4 in.
13:22
in other places.
13:24
It was that fine ash as you got further east where it
13:30
was very, very fine and if it got wet it would create all kinds of muck on
13:34
things and people were shoveling it out.
13:37
I remember on the news where they were showing, probably eastern
13:41
Washington the darkness there, showing people with little filter masks
13:48
on, people trying to shovel out.
13:50
Then, some of the images of the flow going down the Toutle River and then
13:58
things being backed up on the bridges.
14:01
That was one that was, I think, a fairly popular one because TV likes
14:08
to show devastation in humans, and the bridges you had all the river,
14:14
you had things being taken out.
14:16
It was very dramatic.
14:17
It was dramatic.
14:18
Good TV.
14:18
Yeah.
14:21
In the month, two months since it woke up until it blew its
14:25
top, did you have any inkling?
14:28
You’re not a volcanologist but still—the bulge that kept going out, I remember
14:33
as a very unsophisticated young person, I’m saying that sounds really dangerous.
14:39
I just remember hearing that.
14:41
Did you have any of that inkling too as you read about this thing bulging out?
14:47
You know, I think where my inkling might have come from was some of the news
14:52
stories as they tried to get a sense and as the folks with USGS would be trying
14:57
to tell the stories of what might happen.
15:01
That concept of a bulge, if you think about it as human health,
15:04
you go if your body bulges out at some point something icky happens.
15:10
Yeah, it seemed like that kind of thing.
15:16
As you mentioned earlier about the Hawaii volcanoes, I don’t think I
15:19
really thought a whole lot about what kind of eruption might occur.
15:24
I probably didn’t have in my mind, which is odd thinking back, you’d
15:30
think well I would’ve been more sophisticated about this, but I probably
15:34
didn’t have a picture in my mind.
15:37
It would have been more like the notion of the Hawaii volcanoes and
15:40
a lava flow and that kind of image.
15:43
Hot, orange lava, runny, real picturesque kind of stuff.
15:48
That you might be able to run away from or something, even though I knew
15:52
that wasn’t what they were expecting.
15:55
I didn’t have another context.
15:58
What, obviously, you weren’t involved with the management of this area yet,
16:04
but in retrospect looking back at the challenges that the governor and the
16:08
local sheriffs and the state police had in terms of controlling this situation,
16:15
curiosity seekers, adventure seekers, etc., just talk a little about what the
16:21
challenge you thought they had and how they handled it, how you maybe thought
16:26
they could have done better [the red zone, the blue zone], all that dynamic.
16:29
What would you have liked to have seen done?
16:32
This is kind of your chance to rewrite history, but just
16:34
say a little bit about that.
16:36
You know, it’s an interesting question because as a long-term Forest Service
16:41
employee I’ve been in what we call a line-officer position, which is a
16:46
decision-maker role, either as a district ranger, deputy forest supervisor, forest
16:51
supervisor, area manager, since 1987.
16:55
So, for a long time.
16:57
I have to say that one of the things that, I think as I look
17:00
back is that, I am really amazed with what they did accomplish.
17:05
I think about that day and time and the resources we had and the kinds of things
17:09
we had dealt with in this country, and I’m fairly impressed with what occurred.
17:20
All my knowledge of the red zone, the blue zone, those kinds of things
17:24
is more superficial in that I didn’t work in this area, although I did
17:29
start working here May 18 of 1981 on the recovery projects and actually
17:34
experienced that version of it.
17:37
The thing that I reflect on as I think about that, is you’re always
17:43
torn as a manager between providing people access and then managing the
17:49
danger that might occur, whether it’s with something like the eruption
17:53
or with fire or with even a natural location, where there might be danger.
17:59
You have to find that balance.
18:02
In this setting, where there was so much unknown, one of the corollaries I take
18:09
to it is when I worked in Montana in the late ‘80s and there was a lot of fire
18:15
going on and it was a lot of intensity and a lot of the fires that occur it’s very
18:21
difficult to manage any public access.
18:24
I remember one year the governor was not running for reelection and he
18:28
made the very difficult decision to close the state to public access,
18:33
in essence, close public lands.
18:36
Because of the dryness.
18:38
Because of the dryness.
18:38
Because of the number of fires we had going.
18:40
Because of the inability to help people if they were in these dangerous situations.
18:46
That was just before hunting season.
18:49
Not a really popular decision.
18:51
No.
18:52
I think about how difficult that choice was.
18:55
Then I think about this situation where you have this bulge and you
19:00
have scientists who are telling you something is going to happen, but we
19:03
don’t really know what and here’s the different things and knowing how many
19:09
people loved this place and they felt connected to it and they felt that it
19:13
was their right to be here, plus all the lookie-loos who want to come near.
19:21
I think the concept of how they developed those zones is a good principle.
19:26
How you would identify where they should be, you know, is an amazing thought.
19:34
I don’t really have a lot of judgment.
19:37
I think you could have made the zone where people couldn’t be bigger, and you
19:42
would have had a lot of political fallout.
19:46
That said, if the eruption had happened the next day, on Monday, I think the
19:52
judgments that existed even with the location would have been phenomenal,
19:58
because on the next day you would have had hundreds of people in the impacted area.
20:04
Meaning more forest—?
20:04
Primarily forestry work on the private lands—
20:08
[Talking over LB] And the Weyerhaeuser lands.
20:11
The Weyerhaeuser lands.
20:11
Having this occur on a Sunday early in the day mitigated the loss of life.
20:20
Although, if it had happened the day before when they let all
20:23
the people go into their cabins.
20:25
[Talks over SS] And to access things.
20:26
And the lodges to pick stuff up, you probably would have lost
20:30
about 100 more people, probably.
20:33
Yes.
20:33
Including a lot of the state troopers that were taking them in there.
20:35
Right.
20:37
So, when you think about all the lessons we’ve had about the ecology
20:40
and the different things about the event and the time and where snow
20:44
was and where the animals were, the human dimension is very similar.
20:49
You could, should this eruption have happened later in the day, a different
20:53
day, pick any day, the human ecology of what occurred and the judgments
20:59
around the loss of life and allowing people in or not letting them in
21:05
would have been very different.
21:07
So, it’s one of the ah-has for me about that is you can never put in fail-safes.
21:16
You do the best that you can in trying to mitigate risk and yet provide
21:20
opportunity and no matter what happens there will always be judgments and, as a
21:27
decision-maker, whether you’re the forest supervisor or the governor, whoever’s
21:31
making those decisions, one of the things that you have to do is take the best
21:35
information you can get, weigh it out, and then make that determination using
21:42
that information and then feel comfortable with the choices that you make because
21:51
there will always be second guessing.
21:54
There always is going to be, assuming that these events occur, there will
22:00
be choices where you can look back and go would-a, could-a, should-a.
22:04
That doesn’t help you.
22:05
You can feel regret.
22:06
You can feel wishing and hoping, but the reality is what you need
22:11
to do is take that lesson and move forward into the future.
22:14
How do you help teach other people?
22:20
The interesting thing: when the volcano started waking up again in 2004, I was
22:23
the deputy for a supervisor on the forest.
22:29
For the Gifford Pinchot?
22:31
For the Gifford Pinchot.
22:31
We knew some things were going.
22:33
There was harmonic tremor occurring and there were these different
22:36
pieces happening and we had to make this decision of what do we do?
22:40
One of the choices that we made on one of the mornings was to
22:45
evacuate Johnston Ridge Observatory.
22:49
But we made some interesting choices about that because we
22:52
didn’t know quite what was going on.
22:54
We didn’t have an understanding.
22:56
We forgot to involve the State Patrol.
22:59
Here we were, we were deciding to evacuate people out of Johnston Ridge.
23:03
How many people did that involve?
23:06
There was a lot of people there that morning.
23:09
You’re talking about the visitors?
23:11
We’re talking about the visitors.
23:12
Right, okay.
23:12
That was kind of a full train of cars going down and during that process
23:17
as we got things stood up to do our incident command piece around that,
23:21
that was another example of learning is we made a good decision and we needed
23:26
to make sure we had in place all those partners for how to manage that and
23:32
so we kind of quickly moved to that.
23:37
That’s kind of not the red zone/blue zone, but it’s that piece of
23:43
getting the best information you can, getting it from the sources who have a
23:49
best understanding and knowing back in the 1980, there was lots of different advice.
23:56
You had advice from the volcanologist, advice from State Patrol, you probably
24:01
had the governor getting advice from all different kinds of people.
24:05
Weyerhaeuser.
24:06
A lot of pressure around access to private lands and economic issues.
24:13
Somehow, she had to weigh all that out and so I tend not to second-guess those.
24:21
Could have been a lot worse than 58 people died.
24:24
58 people died.
24:25
Yeah.
24:25
I mean it could have been much, much, much worse.
24:27
It could have been much worse.
24:30
As we mentioned on any different day there would have likely been more deaths.
24:35
Some of the deaths were outside of the area that were predicted to be and
24:39
some of the deaths were people who were in areas they weren’t supposed to be.
24:51
How do you think the location of your formative years affected your
24:56
views on ecology science and a career in forestry and land management?
25:01
I think it affected me a lot.
25:05
I try to think back, and pinpoint was it there?
25:10
What I remember is a collection of memories.
25:13
One of the growing up in the ‘60s during the Civil Rights Era, during a
25:19
lot of the transitions of environmental laws, really had a big effect on me.
25:27
I loved growing up in Eastern Tennessee.
25:29
I spent most of my time outdoors.
25:33
Some intriguing memories that I have is actually living in a neighborhood where
25:37
they were growing the neighborhood and I actually remember running through
25:42
some of the big sewer pipes before they closed them off and thinking
25:45
of that as an outdoor adventure.
25:48
Growing up in Oak Ridge, which was you know created as one of
25:53
the cities that helped provide the materials for the atomic bomb, there
25:59
was a lot of interesting history.
26:03
I got an amazing education at the time.
26:06
There were, and I don’t know whether this was true, I remember
26:09
hearing this, more Ph.Ds.
26:11
per capita than anywhere else in the country.
26:13
They invested in education.
26:15
So, it was a smart town.
26:16
It was a town that valued education.
26:21
I believe that because of that I got exposed to a lot of different things.
26:28
I was your normal kid.
26:29
I was in the marching band.
26:30
I actually, my high school had a young women’s basketball team.
26:35
That was before Title IX, before the _____ [Sam interrupts]
26:37
. Long before Title IX, yes.
26:39
I got to play on that team.
26:40
I remember we got the boy’s hand-me-down jerseys.
26:43
I loved growing up in that era where a lot of things were changing, and
26:49
you were on the cusp of things.
26:52
One of my memories around
26:56
thinking about how it influenced my views on environmental things is there
27:02
was a private timber company named Bowater, and I think they had this
27:09
awareness that to survive in the coming days you really had to be able to help
27:16
educate the public about what your purpose was and what you were doing.
27:21
They would create these things called pocket wilderness areas and what they
27:25
really were the areas they probably going to be able to manage for economic value,
27:31
but they tended to have great viewpoints.
27:34
They would be rocky areas and they would have riparian experiences
27:39
and they would create trails.
27:41
Then they would have these openings for the trails, and I remember the parents
27:45
would take you and they’d stand there and eat donuts and drink coffee while
27:49
all of us kids would do the trail.
27:52
The interesting thing was we would try to do it as fast as we could.
27:55
Most of us weren’t out there scoping out what insects were, we’d
27:59
just try to get around the trail.
28:02
Then you would get a patch and you could collect the patches.
28:05
That
28:07
is one of my vivid memories as a young person other than canoeing
28:11
the rivers and being out there.
28:16
What’s interesting to me is it embedded the concept of the idea of
28:20
wilderness for me, so the Wilderness Act was in 1964 and here I was on
28:26
these ideas of pocket wildernesses and much of Eastern Tennessee, once
28:30
you get away from the Smoky Mountain National Park, is private land.
28:34
So, pocket wilderness is really what you have to live with.
28:37
You’re not going to have big wilderness that you have in the west or in Alaska.
28:41
In the eastern states,
28:45
much of our thinking evolved as you go out west.
28:48
Much of the east was cut over, either for firewood to build fences, to grow
28:56
food, and so as you moved your way west, we were having a huge impact
29:01
back in the 17, 1800s on the landscape.
29:05
The experiences that you have in the east, you know, no national forest
29:10
could be created until after the Weeks Act of 1911 and that allowed
29:14
the government to buy back land.
29:17
It was through that awareness and transition that many of the reserves
29:21
and the public lands that were dedicated to this huge legacy we
29:28
have in the west; it was through learning the impacts in the east.
29:32
Having grown up in the east and spending time in the Smokys and spending a
29:37
lot of time outdoors, although we didn’t have large landscapes, we
29:41
did have these amazing forests.
29:44
One of the things I love about the east is the number of hardwood species
29:48
we had and the diversity of forest.
29:51
I would roam those hills and I remember hearing the term “ecology.”
29:59
I think in college
30:02
for a while I still had George [Eugene?] Odum’s ecology book,
30:06
which was sort of this “new” idea.
30:11
Those things really framed for me—one of the pieces in my growing up, I finished
30:24
college at Iowa State University and, as I mentioned, I got a degree in
30:28
Outdoor Recreation Resource Management.
30:31
The way that they had structured their program, I also took such a diversity
30:37
of coursework in forestry and a while variety of other things that I qualified
30:42
under the government system for a while variety of programs and what I
30:46
loved about going to school there was they gave you the big picture view.
30:50
You had the opportunity—you know, a lot of people go, “You went to Forestry
30:55
School in Iowa?” you know? And what they don’t realize is the woodlands
31:00
and the riparian forests of Iowa.
31:05
I didn’t want to go to University of Tennessee because there you’d learn, my
31:10
perception was, you’d learn about southern pines and at Oregon State you learned
31:14
about Douglas-fir forestry in the West.
31:17
At Iowa State, they just integrated all the different things.
31:22
Interesting.
31:23
Yet, my piece was how do you connect people to nature?
31:28
It was really that piece about I think experiencing that as a young person being
31:33
so affected and having those events.
31:36
One of my first recollections was being in the Smoky Mountains, and I
31:40
don’t know if I actually made this up.
31:42
Sometimes you create your own memories.
31:45
Yeah, because it sounds good and you’ve repeated it enough times.
31:47
Yeah, but the story I tell is that my parents had taken us for a picnic, and we
31:54
were having the picnic down by the stream.
31:56
We’d taken our little picnic, and I think I even remember the little picnic
32:00
basket like Yogi Bear or something.
32:03
One of my recollections is my brother had fallen in the creek and his pants got
32:06
wet and they were hanging on a branch and my mom had made us sandwiches with white
32:12
bread, mayonnaise, and cheese, none of which did I like, but we were supposed
32:17
to eat our food, so I had taken it back up to the parking lot, but I was only
32:22
about 5 and I couldn’t get the bear-proof lid off the garbage can, so I put the
32:26
sandwich on top of the garbage can.
32:30
Then a bear came and ate the sandwich and then came looking for more food
32:35
and we were all kind of running around and we got to our cars.
32:38
I was sitting in the car and some man was standing on his car blowing the
32:42
horn at the bears trying to scare it away and the park ranger came and was
32:46
trying to settle that guy down and had this exasperated look on his face.
32:52
I say, I’m not totally sure that’s a true story, but it’s a memory I have.
32:58
The memory of it was there has to be a better way of connecting people
33:04
and so that’s a foundational piece for me as that I really believe in
33:11
wilderness, I really believe in the integrated nature of the system.
33:15
I also know that as a society
33:20
we are an integral part of that system.
33:23
Either connecting people with place for recreation experiences or recognizing
33:30
that there are parts of the system that we use for all the different
33:35
things we want, whether it’s wood for houses, whether it’s, you know, special
33:41
minerals and different things that we put in all the electronics we use
33:44
today: we are integrated with that.
33:47
We need to learn to use those resources nature provides us in a way that
33:54
mitigates the impacts that we’re having.
33:57
But the reality is, as a society, we, at least in this country, many of us
34:05
want enough of those goods that we are going to be extracting things and,
34:11
so, how do you do that in the most
34:16
respectful way possible with the least impact?
34:19
How do you think the contrast between your home state and region deciduous-dominated
34:25
forest affect your view of the northwest, the west, coniferous forest, and how
34:32
you would eventually conceptualize and then actually carry out your management
34:37
when you actually became a professional?
34:39
Interesting.
34:40
That’s a great question.
34:43
One of the pieces growing up is, I grew up in Tennessee and yet, with
34:49
the work that my dad did, we would wind up moving to different spots—so
34:53
we were in Boston for a few months.
34:55
We moved out to Livermore, California, for a bit.
34:59
We always went back to Tennessee.
35:02
One of the things I really appreciate about my parents is
35:06
that they gave us experiences on those trips where we saw things.
35:10
When we moved to Livermore for a time period, we went
35:15
and visited the Grand Canyon.
35:17
We went to Disneyland, too.
35:20
We went to the Redwoods and we experienced those.
35:22
So, I got exposed to other parts of the country.
35:26
What I loved about the Smokys growing up, you know the old part of it, the
35:35
rich soils, the—one of the things I loved about the Smokys and the
35:42
Appalachian Country was that people were integrated into the landscape.
35:46
The hollers, you know, some of it, of course, you remember, if you watched
35:51
the movie Deliverance, there was sort of an image that was conveyed of
35:56
these people that was really wrong.
35:58
The inbred—
36:02
Inbred, you know, people will shoot you, you know—
36:04
Mutants, almost, yeah.
36:05
Yeah.
36:06
You know there’s always a seed or kernel in any stereotype that’s true
36:12
and yet they draw it a different way.
36:16
But I think one thing in
36:20
being in Eastern Tennessee and people really being embedded in the landscape
36:24
I think that has influenced me.
36:28
One of the places I got to work when I was in college was up on the Chippewa
36:33
National Forest in Minnesota, which has a lot of jack pine and is very flat and you
36:40
need a compass to find your way around.
36:43
I loved working there.
36:44
I remember seeing one of the largest eagle nest I’ve ever seen in my life.
36:48
It was a couple tons large.
36:51
In a big tree?
36:52
In a big tree, and big, white pine.
36:55
It was different white pine than what I saw in Eastern Tennessee.
37:00
One of the things that helped me was recognizing those differences.
37:05
I kind of remember as a kid that I had a literal part to me where
37:12
I probably thought it rained all over the world when it rained.
37:15
The time when I really figured out it didn’t was when I could see it raining
37:19
in one place and not in another.
37:23
Getting to be exposed to those differences in geology and geography and the ecology
37:31
of a place was really wonderful for me.
37:37
I worked on Montana for 8 ½ years.
37:39
I love the Rocky Mountains.
37:41
There’s something about them.
37:43
You’re at 3,000 ft. elevation at the base of the mountains
37:47
and they’re just there and
37:51
the wildness of the grizzly bears and such.
37:55
I miss them yet today, and I’ve been gone since 1989.
37:59
I wouldn’t move back, but I love them.
38:01
It’s like they’re a part of my heart.
38:04
I
38:07
think one of the things growing up in the East taught me, one was the
38:12
diversity of possibly, the wide range of species and interactions, the way
38:19
in which humans were in the landscape and to always appreciate that and to
38:24
appreciate differences and I think that helps me in the work I do today.
38:29
You mentioned the trip out West.
38:32
I promise I won’t reference Chevy Chase’s Vacation.
38:37
You mentioned Grand Canyon, Disneyland, or Wally World, right?
38:41
But joking aside, in terms of the cross section you would get of new
38:47
landscapes, bigger mountains, then you saw what do you remember about the
38:52
first exposures to really different landscapes and the bigger topography of
38:57
the west, for instance and some of the places and types of places and types
39:02
of geography that really impacted you?
39:07
Well, the Grand Canyon is an obvious one.
39:11
In terms of you know you hear about it; you see pictures of it and yet to be
39:18
there and to stand there to actually be in that place and experience it—I
39:24
think I remember is a feeling of awe.
39:28
Then, to experience, I was about 8 at the time when we did that, moved out
39:35
to Livermore for a bit, 8 or 9, and
39:42
one of the formative memories actually that I have of that:
39:44
I was the oldest of 4 kids.
39:46
We were driving and of course didn’t have air conditioning then.
39:51
I would entertain the kids.
39:52
I would tell stories and I would make stories up.
39:55
I remember my mom saying something about that to my dad.
40:00
That’s a memory that I have—I would make up stories about the landscapes
40:04
and try to translate them, even though I didn’t know what I was seeing.
40:13
It’s a very vivid memory of that.
40:16
I remember the petrified forest.
40:18
That’s a place of—
40:20
In Arizona?
40:21
In Arizona.
40:22
Visiting that and actually this concept of petrified wood.
40:28
Zion National Park was a formative place of amazement to me.
40:35
The Redwoods.
40:36
That idea that you could drive through a tree.
40:40
It just kind of—I think what it did was give me a different scale and
40:47
it was about magnitude, you know.
40:51
In the East there are so many people in so much small areas and you learn to live
40:56
with a lot of people, and you learn to experience things on a different scale.
41:03
The West was massive.
41:05
Everything seemed bigger.
41:06
Did you guys ever come up here to the Pacific Northwest?
41:11
We actually drove back this way.
41:14
We drove north through Seattle and went across Northern Washington
41:18
and drove through Glacier.
41:21
I don’t remember most of that at that time, but what I remember was
41:26
we stopped at it was probably on the east side of Glacier and the
41:32
Flathead Tribe was doing a pow wow.
41:36
I remember that.
41:37
The Blackfeet Tribe?
41:37
It was Blackfeet probably on the east side, yeah, because the
41:41
Flathead were down on the south end.
41:42
It was probably east of where the fire is right now.
41:46
Were they on St. Mary’s Lake then?
41:49
No.
41:49
The famous lake that’s just below Logan Pass and then going to the Sun Road.
41:53
You know, I don’t really recall.
41:56
Okay, but you were 8.
41:56
I was about 8.
41:59
Okay, so.
42:00
I recall the event and I might not have recalled where it was until I actually
42:03
moved to the Flathead Valley and then drove the going to the Sun Road and went,
42:09
oh, this is where that was kind of thing.
42:13
Now, do you remember when you were here seeing any Mt. Rainier, for instance?
42:18
I don’t recall that.
42:19
Because, I mean that’s the dominant—
42:20
It’s the dominant feature, and realistically if we drove across, I
42:25
probably saw it but it’s not in my memory.
42:27
Right, right.
42:30
So, when did you first see Mount.
42:32
St. Helens in person?
42:35
So, my first experience seeing Mount St. Helens in person was actually
42:41
other than seeing it from a distance driving, but actually experience the
42:46
mountain was when I started working here on the recovery projects in 1981.
42:53
So, after the big blast?
42:54
After the big blast, yeah.
42:57
You never saw it beforehand in person?
42:59
Well, you might have when you were 8, but you wouldn’t have remembered.
43:00
I might have, but I wouldn’t remember.
43:04
I had made a trip over to the coast with some friends when I worked in Idaho.
43:10
We came over for a concert or some such.
43:14
It would have been about 1979, maybe 1980.
43:18
But I don’t remember St. Helens.
43:22
As we drove, I probably would have seen it, but it doesn’t stick in my mind.
43:27
I’d be making it up to tell you it did.
43:31
You know as I’m thinking about it, I obviously would have
43:34
seen pictures of St. Helens.
43:35
I would have seen it in the news because as it woke up it
43:39
was newsworthy and noteworthy.
43:42
I think the reason it’s hard for me to remember my first impression of St. Helens
43:48
is that when I had the unique opportunity to work here on what the Forest
43:54
Service called the Recovery Projects, I actually got to work in the blast zone.
44:00
I flew in almost every day by helicopter.
44:03
This was like a year after, right?
44:04
It was one year after the eruption.
44:07
I was in the middle of the blast zone and it was such an impactful thing.
44:14
One way I describe the people is it was the highlight of my career
44:17
and yet my career had just started.
44:19
Nothing would I ever do after that would I experience it the same way.
44:26
I spent almost every day in the blast zone.
44:30
Any day they could fly in, we flew in by helicopter.
44:33
We would land at these landings and you had all this gray and things around
44:40
you and there were these massive trees.
44:42
The area that I worked was actually just off to the west of us and these
44:48
6 ft. plus diameter trees that had been tossed down and where I was,
44:52
they were tossed and crisscrossed.
44:56
You would try to move around, and I would walk out this tree.
45:00
Then all of a sudden, I’d realize oh my gosh I’m 50 ft. off the ground you know
45:04
because they had been so crisscrossed.
45:06
Then I’d go another area and it was all this standing dead or I’d walk around
45:11
a corner and you could smell death.
45:13
In other words, similar to where we are right now, at Ryan Lake, some of
45:15
these standing dead, which would be considered the scorch zone, correct?
45:19
Yeah.
45:20
It would be in the scorch zone.
45:21
Then you’d come around the corner and you’d be on the edge where the
45:24
wave came through and there’d be all green trees off to the side.
45:29
I would be in all this gray and I’d be covered in it.
45:33
Your hair would just be like a board and at the end of the day you were just
45:39
drenched in all this ash and what not.
45:43
Yet, you’d be walking through it and there’d be this little green plant.
45:46
I
45:49
remember vividly walking around one spot and smelling death and coming around a
45:54
corner and seeing the carcasses of a herd of a number of elk, and, so, I think,
46:00
because I wasn’t embedded in the place before the eruption, that was such a
46:12
visceral experience that any memories I have of it are just overshadowed by that.
46:17
It was such an amazing thing to be part of that and to be out in that landscape
46:24
and to be walking through it and to be one of very few people who got to do that.
46:30
I felt it was just a gift to be out there.
46:34
I wasn’t like the researchers who came in and they were dashing and looking
46:38
at things and seeing it for that.
46:39
In 1981 they were setting up their first pots.
46:43
They were setting up their first plots.
46:43
The first year they were just figuring out what they wanted to do, and the
46:46
second year is when they started doing the veg plots that would
46:49
then be repeated up to the present.
46:50
Yeah, the part that I was on
46:52
was on the management group as you’ll hear the scientists talk, they talk about well
46:59
the managers just wanted to get in there and cut the trees and recover the area.
47:03
Well, one of the challenges is nobody had ever experienced this before, so nobody
47:08
knew what was going to come of that and whether it’s blow-down or fire-kill trees.
47:16
If you are going to get an economic product out of something
47:19
there’s a limited time window.
47:21
Just the nature of what had happened here managers did what
47:25
managers do and they organized, and
47:29
they coordinated, and they came up with a plan for how they were
47:32
going to do a variety of areas.
47:36
They had four detailers who had come in and were helping them on the planning
47:39
on the east side, like the Clearwater drainage and different places.
47:44
Then they decided decisions had not yet been made about
47:49
what would be the boundary.
47:51
There was a portion of the National Forest Lands that were north of the
47:54
volcano and Green River and there’s a place called Tradedollar off to the east
47:59
of us and Miners Creek and not knowing where the boundaries would wind up,
48:04
they decided they needed to plan as if.
48:07
They needed another person.
48:09
I had been offered a job at the Eldorado and when President Reagan was elected he
48:18
put a freeze on government hiring and the way it was interpreted by many departments
48:25
that included moving amongst government jobs and by the time they took the freeze
48:29
off in March they had determined they could only hire one person and they had
48:34
made 3 job offers and the job they wanted to hire then was a community planner.
48:41
I no longer had a job.
48:42
I was finishing this advanced program and I needed to find a place for a new
48:48
assignment and so I was available and here at St. Helens they needed somebody,
48:55
and so I got offered the opportunity and it was like what an amazing gift to come
49:01
north here and to spend I think I spent about 6 months working in the volcano.
49:08
Again, I was on the opposite side of everybody.
49:11
I was on the north end of the volcano.
49:13
Were you down by Morton, or?
49:16
No, it’s actually just sort of west of where we are right now.
49:21
If you could throw a rock this way—
49:22
So, up here, okay.
49:23
Most everybody else worked on the east side on the Clearwater drainage that we
49:27
stopped and visited on the field trip.
49:31
Before there was Windy Ridge there was a little landing zone up there and
49:36
it was full of really light pumice.
49:41
It was like little marbles that would roll around.
49:44
Most people worked from that spot.
49:47
Their helicopters would land there, and they would work east.
49:51
I was in this area just to the west of us, where we’re sitting now.
49:58
When we would fly in, we would fly on the west side of the volcano.
50:03
There was actually a little air strip that was out by Chelatchie Prairie
50:07
they had rented a field out there.
50:10
It looked like this whole little air area.
50:13
There’d be 6 or 8 helicopters there.
50:16
We would fly in on the west side of the volcano and I could actually
50:20
see it puffing and doing things.
50:23
Then we would land, and you were supposed to be within a certain
50:26
number of minutes of your helicopter.
50:29
In case the mountain got angry again.
50:31
The reality is you couldn’t get very far in those minutes and so
50:35
we all kind of played a little bit with that time zone and
50:42
whether this is true or not I remember most of the pilots
50:45
had been Vietnam air pilots.
50:47
They were a little bit wildcat-ers, and they’d say you know if it’s
50:50
going, I’m not waiting around.
50:54
Climb in, and so it was just a phenomenal experience being
51:01
in the place, being grounded.
51:03
One of the memories I have on Green River is that we couldn’t work alone and so each
51:11
helicopter had a helicopter manager that would come with those of us who were doing
51:16
the work and they would follow us around.
51:20
One time we came up on this little cabin that was
51:25
I’m sure not authorized and I remember being very nervous because you could see
51:31
there were things situated around on it with dust on it and wondering whether
51:35
to open the door or not, wondering if there might be somebody in there.
51:40
We finally got up the nerve and kind of pushed the door open and there was nobody
51:44
in there and there was this dusting in there and there were air mattresses.
51:51
They were still about ¾ full.
51:54
You knew that somebody had been there at some point around
51:59
the time of the eruption.
52:04
They’re just amazing recollections for me of being in this place,
52:10
seeing so many different things, getting to be a part of that.
52:16
One of the memories I have too is there were a number of times when
52:20
helicopters would go down, crash.
52:23
Because of the intake of
52:27
the ash?
52:28
Or just—
52:28
It could have been other mechanical difficulties.
52:31
We used what’s called interdisciplinary teams to help weigh out different
52:35
things, so a hydrologist, might be a silviculturist, a wildlife biologist
52:42
and we would schedule because you really couldn’t drive very far in, so you used
52:46
helicopters and there was a large Sikorsky that would carry a number of people and
52:52
I had scheduled the helicopter to bring this interdisciplinary team to walk
52:57
around and talk to them about ideas and we got bumped because they needed to put
53:03
down what was called poly-binder [dust abatement] on some of the landing areas
53:07
so that other helicopters could land.
53:10
The amazing piece to me—it’s where you start, depending on whether you’re
53:16
religious or believe in things, you just kind of go, interesting—is the day that we
53:21
got bumped from that helicopter actually when they were dropping the poly-binder
53:27
nobody else could be in the helicopter with the pilot because of the nature of
53:31
the work they’re doing and its hydraulic system failed and he managed to land.
53:39
He wasn’t killed, but he managed, he was going across treetops and
53:44
he just clipped the top of a tree before he landed in an old clear-cut.
53:51
He actually did crash.
53:52
He was okay, but the reality is if that had happened with all of us in there—
53:57
Somebody would have died, probably.
54:00
Yeah, he would not have had the ability to get that far.
54:02
One more person in there _____ [Sam talks over LB]
54:04
. Because of the weight.
54:04
The weight.
54:05
And so, you had this kind of craziness that went on.
54:09
It was almost like you knew you could die any day.
54:14
The volcano could take you out.
54:16
The helicopters could take you out.
54:19
We were working long hours: 12 plus hours a day, lots of days in
54:24
a row and in this ethereal place.
54:29
It created this just odd kind of community as well that I say for me
54:36
that experience felt like at the time like I would never top that experience.
54:43
I have had more amazing experiences working for the Forest Service
54:48
and they were different.
54:50
None of them were quite like that visceral effect of being in this, you know we all
54:57
know the earth is a living creature and it’s all these different things, and yet
55:02
it felt so, you really felt the aliveness.
55:07
Interesting.
55:08
And the impact and I can’t even—I don’t really have words to describe
55:13
what it was like and I just feel so grateful to have had the opportunity,
55:19
especially not being a scientist.
55:22
Much of the work I did wound up being, you could do it work for naught.
55:27
It was the in-case work and much of those areas wound up being
55:32
part of the area that was traded
55:35
to a timber company and they actually did log those areas, but they were
55:41
traded from the National Forest in order to access some really special
55:45
parts that are now part of the monument.
55:49
Also, it was during that part of time when a lot of people were involved with trying
55:55
to influence, well, what would be the boundaries of the monument, the different
55:58
alternatives that were looked at.
56:00
At that day and time, I didn’t really understand all of that.
56:04
When I came back later in 2000 as the Deputy Forest Supervisor and got to
56:09
be part of it again, I got a whole different experience of the place.
56:16
So, you worked 6 months in ’81.
56:19
Were you involved also in ensuing years as the Monument was negotiated,
56:25
fought over, eventually created?
56:27
I was not part of that.
56:30
After I worked here on that I actually got a permanent job offer working on
56:36
the Flathead National Forest in Montana.
56:39
So, I went there in the Fall of 1981 and got enamored of the Rocky
56:45
Mountains and the Bob Marshall Wilderness and that huge landscape.
56:51
I have to admit, although I’d had this amazing experience at Mount St. Helens,
56:57
you know I tracked it, but I was not a part of the creation of
57:04
it.
57:04
It’s one of the things that are sort of about me, I get to a place
57:09
and I can just love that place.
57:12
Mount St. Helens always has a special place in my heart.
57:14
I keep coming back here today because of that, even though I work at the
57:21
Columbia River Gorge, being able to connect with the scientist, even to be
57:27
in the place it’s a special linkage.
57:31
But it didn’t become my passion like it did for some others.
57:34
Exactly, but in a way, it is a passion, though.
57:38
It is, it just wasn’t, I wasn’t part of that creating the Monument.
57:43
I probably didn’t even know all that stuff that was going on.
57:47
I remember meeting at the time he was the District Ranger, because
57:52
the Monument hadn’t been created.
57:53
I think I met him once.
57:56
His name was Ken Johnson.
57:58
They’re driving in towards and they’re going towards the Green River, so if
58:03
we had gone on that road, if we had turned that road would have taken
58:07
us around and around this, and right around that corner is where part
58:13
of the spots I would have worked.
58:14
Lynn is describing another road because we’re hearing vehicles drive on the other
58:18
side of Ryan Lake where they would go or if we would go if we decide to go on that.
58:26
Yes, orientation for your tape, yeah.
58:28
Or, it sounds like
58:31
what the heck?
58:32
Tell me a little about Ryan Lake since we came here first and this was, I believe
58:37
the first place that one of the teams came like 10 days after the big blast.
58:45
It’s my understanding, from Jerry Franklin and others, that this was one
58:49
of the first places that people were able to get to and actually experience.
58:54
I’m going to speak to it more from the manager side because that’s probably
59:01
what I’ll be more accurate about.
59:07
As the Monument was developed, separate from the coming and learning about the
59:13
ecology and learning how the ecological processes were going to come through, as
59:18
they developed the act and thought about all the purposes and right now, I couldn’t
59:23
rattle the main purposes off to you.
59:26
There was a time when I could.
59:28
If we do a transcript, I’ll write them out for you.
59:31
I’m sure somebody else is or your researching them.
59:34
One of the purposes is around recreation and interpretation and
59:37
another is around allowing ecological processes, nature to continue unimpeded.
59:46
One of
59:50
the challenges that we have here is how do you create that Monument in
59:54
that setting that will allow nature to teach us so many lessons and
1:00:00
for us to observe what’s going on.
1:00:02
And yet, connect people with place, which for me is one of those
1:00:07
important pieces and from a managerial standpoint one of the things that
1:00:14
the act designated is you create a comprehensive management plan and I
1:00:20
believe that you’re carrying a copy of that around with you.
1:00:23
Yes, I always carry around best sellers in my book, in my truck.
1:00:27
What I’m going to encourage you is to hang onto that management plan
1:00:30
because they’re hard to find anymore.
1:00:32
There aren’t that many copies and it’s one of those unique parts that
1:00:38
after the act was created, or after the enabling legislation occurred, the
1:00:44
process started to find that balance and where were the places that we
1:00:49
were not going to allow public access?
1:00:50
Where were the places that we would develop?
1:00:53
Where were the different experiences that we were going to create?
1:00:57
As you study that management plan, you’ll notice there are
1:01:01
different kinds of experiences.
1:01:03
Here at Ryan Lake we’re at the north end.
1:01:06
We’re right on the edge of the Monument, the designated Monument.
1:01:10
Where would be the line as we’re looking at right here?
1:01:13
So, we’re looking out at the middle of Ryan Lake.
1:01:16
And the mountain in back is what Strawberry Mountain you said before?
1:01:20
No, the mountain actually to the east of us is Strawberry Mountain, so our backs
1:01:26
are facing Strawberry Mountain right now.
1:01:29
I’m going to look at it and make sure I get the right—Goat Mountain
1:01:33
is what we’re looking at to the west.
1:01:36
So, the Monument boundary would be just to our north and one of the places
1:01:43
with where we are here at Ryan Lake, actually the Monument boundary is
1:01:49
just on the other side of the lake.
1:01:52
So, the lake itself is not in the Monument, the designated Monument.
1:01:58
Then, the boundary turns and goes up that ridge line and follows Goat
1:02:04
Mountain and heads to the north.
1:02:08
A piece of what we’re looking at across the lake from us is not in the designated
1:02:14
Monument but if we’re to look a little bit further to the south, it is.
1:02:19
It’s one of those intriguing things where you think about how
1:02:22
did they come up with these lines?
1:02:25
That’s an interesting negotiation process that goes on.
1:02:28
I believe they looked at about 7 alternatives ranging from every impacted
1:02:32
acre plus some to a variety and they—
1:02:36
Chose D I believe, didn’t they?
1:02:37
I believe so, and it involved a lot of land exchanges are a big part of the act.
1:02:44
A big chunk designates what land exchanges will occur.
1:02:49
It also incorporated all these different features that had occurred
1:02:53
as a result of the eruption and so from a recreation standpoint and
1:02:59
connecting people with nature, you’ll see that throughout the Monument the
1:03:04
spot that we’re at I think we’ve heard one car come in behind us, it’s not
1:03:09
as accessible as many other places.
1:03:12
This is what you might call a more dispersed area.
1:03:15
Many people who visit the Monument go up the
1:03:21
visitor’s center corridor, the [Highway] 503 corridor and they’ll drive up.
1:03:25
It’s basically the highway was recreated.
1:03:28
They worked their way up the hill, moved the road away from the Toutle
1:03:33
River, so that, as more things occurred, the road would be safe and
1:03:39
in essence the Forest Service built visitor’s centers on their way in.
1:03:44
The first one was at Silver Lake; the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center told
1:03:49
the story of the human dimension and it’s actually on State Park land.
1:03:55
As it went further up, Cold Water was constructed.
1:03:59
Mount St. Helens
1:04:03
Visitor Center opened in ’86.
1:04:05
Coldwater opened in ’93 and it told the story of the biological [responses]
1:04:09
and then they went further on up and in 1997 Johnston Ridge Observatory opened.
1:04:17
The Forest Service was managing 3 major visitor centers on a paved road.
1:04:22
There’s some interesting little dynamics that go with that.
1:04:26
For example, when they opened Johnston Ridge Observatory, if it had not been a
1:04:31
fee charged for the visitor centers; there was no money to open the visitors’ center.
1:04:37
A part of that is later, when I came back, one of the things that we learned
1:04:42
is it costs about a half a million dollars just to run a visitors’ center.
1:04:47
A year?
1:04:47
Yeah.
1:04:48
And that’s just staffing and some of the operational pieces of it.
1:04:54
That’s probably an underestimate in terms of not covering the
1:04:57
real maintenance that happens.
1:05:00
So, if your appropriated budget say is a million dollars and you have
1:05:05
three visitors’ centers that alone are a million and a half dollars,
1:05:10
you need a fee program that those people are visiting help pay it.
1:05:16
That’s the really developed site.
1:05:18
It gets all kinds of visitation, huge amounts of school kids come here.
1:05:24
On the south side you’ve got Ape Cave and the Trail of Two Forests
1:05:29
closer to the Vancouver area, still a little harder to get to.
1:05:33
This area that we’re at right now, Ryan Lake, you know we’re probably
1:05:39
closer to Rainier than we are to the south end of the Monument, if
1:05:45
you thought about driving somewhere.
1:05:47
It’s a very dispersed area.
1:05:49
You have to want to get here.
1:05:51
We’re actually—if we were to look west and south, we’re near Mt. Margaret which has
1:05:57
all kinds of very dispersed [recreation]
1:05:59
— Over that way, right, and to the left?
1:05:59
Yeah.
1:06:00
To our left.
1:06:01
It’s
1:06:03
one of those places that you sign up to go in because it’s a very
1:06:08
long hike and you hike into these individual spots where you’re’ really
1:06:15
experiencing kind of a wilderness effect.
1:06:18
Here at Ryan Lake you can drive to it.
1:06:21
I think we’ve heard the second vehicle in the time we’ve been here.
1:06:24
And a diesel.
1:06:26
Yeah and it doesn’t get a lot of visitation and yet what
1:06:29
people are experiencing is the edge of the blast zone.
1:06:33
Right here you can see trees that are laying down.
1:06:36
You see standing dead.
1:06:38
You see the understory coming back in and you can experience kind of the edge of
1:06:46
the power of what the mountain happened.
1:06:50
This is one of those sites that was set up as people could
1:06:54
come in for multiple reasons.
1:06:58
One is communities want economic benefit from this, and one of the
1:07:01
frustrations communities along Highway 12 have, so Packwood, Randle, is that
1:07:07
they don’t get the economic benefits.
1:07:11
Actually, if you’re in Castle Rock and Toutle, you probably don’t think you get
1:07:14
the economic benefits either, because here we have this amazing experience and yet
1:07:21
it can feel like day-trippers for people.
1:07:24
Right.
1:07:25
But there was a big emphasis put on getting access for people, both
1:07:30
for the tourism effect and then to experience different parts.
1:07:35
Places like Ryan Lake, we’re on what’s called the 26 road here.
1:07:40
When we went to Windy Ridge, we’re on the 99 road.
1:07:44
Those actually put you through the blast zone.
1:07:47
You’re experiencing different parts of it.
1:07:49
On the 99 road, one edge, as you’re on the west side you’re in the Monument
1:07:55
and on the east side, Clearwater drainage, you’re outside the Monument.
1:07:59
Again, you’re getting to see and experience different things.
1:08:06
What do you think they got where they got things right in the
1:08:10
management plan and where did they miss the boat, in your view?
1:08:15
So, great question.
1:08:17
I think they got some amazing things right.
1:08:20
I’m going to hit on a couple that I think are big issues
1:08:24
and probably may never go away.
1:08:27
One of the things that I believe they got right is that we would
1:08:30
not build a cross-Monument road.
1:08:33
There was a lot of political interest in a road that would connect
1:08:37
the _______ [SS talks over LB]
1:08:39
. Johnston Ridge with Windy Ridge, right?
1:08:40
504 corridor to Johnston Ridge, and you really couldn’t do it from there.
1:08:44
You’d have to cut across at the Hummocks, but that would cross
1:08:48
the Pumice Plain, come around the corner and hook into Windy Ridge.
1:08:52
Right to Spirit Lake, even, right?
1:08:54
Right, yeah, you’d be going by Spirit Lake.
1:08:56
The interest in that—you can understand why people want to do it.
1:09:00
I’ve had my moments where I’ve sat at Windy Ridge and gone, “Wow, I
1:09:03
wish I could drive there. I wish I could teleport.” So, I understand it.
1:09:08
From a tourism standpoint and people getting to experience that
1:09:12
it would be an amazing thing.
1:09:14
From the standpoint of ecological processes and natural recovery, much
1:09:19
less trying to build a road and maintain it, it would have been, and I still
1:09:24
believe would still be, a nightmare.
1:09:27
That said, when I was here as Deputy Forest Supervisor even in the early 2000s
1:09:33
there were people who had actually been able to set aside money in the Washington
1:09:41
legislature to do an environmental impact study to locate a road.
1:09:46
We were able to successfully work with a variety of people to, and I’m
1:09:51
going to use my managerial political aspect to help people understand
1:09:57
why that was not a good idea.
1:10:00
So, that’s one thing I think they really got right.
1:10:03
Another thing I believe personally believe we really got right was the area that
1:10:11
at least until today has had limited access for the general public in the
1:10:17
most studied area around the volcano.
1:10:19
Which would be?
1:10:20
Which would be right around the Pumice Plain around Spirit Lake.
1:10:24
To go in there, you have to have a permit
1:10:28
and it’s not general public access.
1:10:31
Again, this was a very controversial thing when I was here on the Forest—in the 2000s
1:10:36
was the idea as people learned that there seemed to be some big fish in Spirit Lake
1:10:41
there was a proposal to allow fishing and to do it through some kind of a lottery
1:10:46
system and we were struggling financially.
1:10:49
We were in that situation where we had to look for really difficult choices.
1:10:55
In 2000 we did a permit with the state to operate Silver Lake Visitor Center.
1:11:02
We were successful at that and we eventually transferred
1:11:05
that visitor center to them.
1:11:07
That was really hard for me as someone who really wants to connect with people.
1:11:12
That’s the connection that’s closest to the interstate.
1:11:17
People who aren’t going to drive all the way up and you can’t even get up
1:11:20
here in the wintertime, we gave up as a Forest Service the opportunity to
1:11:27
really have that connection with people.
1:11:29
Yet, we couldn’t afford it.
1:11:31
We had done that.
1:11:32
We had had to make the hard choice of closing the operation of Coldwater,
1:11:37
because we really only had the funds to operate one visitor center, and,
1:11:42
so, at the time here, we are closing facilities and here are people
1:11:46
coming up with what they perceive are creative ways to generate money.
1:11:51
With the crossroad idea their idea was you’d charge a toll and
1:11:56
it would underwrite the cost.
1:11:58
Well, the reality was the cost of building the road and maintaining it you never
1:12:02
would have had any money to do those.
1:12:04
But, if you don’t really stop and think about that and you're a
1:12:09
general public or legislature and you go, well, you’re closing visitor
1:12:13
centers and you won’t do this idea?
1:12:16
Those were difficult.
1:12:17
The fishing idea was one of those.
1:12:19
You had some really powerful people who very much wanted to create this
1:12:23
unique experience of this lottery of being able to fish on Spirit Lake.
1:12:30
It got very intense.
1:12:35
Within my own agency it was hard for our regional office to understand
1:12:40
why we were trying to stand firm about why that would not be a good
1:12:45
idea and so I think those are things—
1:12:47
Was it mainly the science idea?
1:12:49
The real key was around natural processes taking place and being able to do to the
1:12:56
science and to do it in an unimpeded way.
1:13:01
And so that was our why, you know, if you thought about the big why of why we were
1:13:09
not supporting this it was, although you could come up with all kinds of different
1:13:15
answers, we’ve already have had challenges were people are perhaps going into
1:13:20
areas they aren’t supposed to be, and we don’t have enough people to manage that.
1:13:25
Give me some examples, then.
1:13:27
One example would be folks maybe going off trail and finding their
1:13:33
way down to Spirit Lake and places where they’re not supposed to be.
1:13:36
In other words, creating a whole new social trailing system that
1:13:39
would lead to what have you, right?
1:13:40
Yeah.
1:13:41
That’s a great term that we’re using these days.
1:13:43
So, unauthorized trials we’re calling them social trails these days.
1:13:47
That’s what the Park Service uses too.
1:13:49
The concept of that is that people are finding their way to some place and
1:13:55
one of the ways that we had managed impact trying to find let people
1:14:01
experience the place and yet mitigate the impacts so that we still were having
1:14:07
the ecological process to occur unimpeded was to try and delineate trails.
1:14:13
Some places we would put them.
1:14:15
I know some of the scientists would wish they weren’t there, although they
1:14:18
like being able to use them themselves.
1:14:20
But, that said, once you’ve put the trail in there then you have
1:14:24
that challenge where people decide I’m going to cut the switchback
1:14:28
and I want to [SS interrupts LB]
1:14:29
. So, the course trial becomes a bunch of social trails.
1:14:31
It creates that opportunity.
1:14:32
Erosion problems.
1:14:34
If we don’t have enough people out there engaging with folks and connecting
1:14:38
with them and making them aware of why not to do that, more of that occurs.
1:14:44
We had already had some challenges with that.
1:14:47
What we knew on the fishing thing, one is you’re putting more boats in.
1:14:54
Separate from the ecological and the social are the science processes.
1:14:59
There’s all kinds of safety issues.
1:15:02
You can be out there on Spirit Lake and the wind shifts and the log mat moves.
1:15:08
From a search and rescue standpoint it’s very difficult to get to.
1:15:13
We had a whole number of reasons we had identified, but the
1:15:16
science one was the big one.
1:15:19
At the time congressman Brian Baird, you know, he was trying to address a lot of
1:15:24
different interests that society has, and he loves Mount St. Helens, by the way.
1:15:29
Yet it was difficult for him to understand why we weren’t
1:15:32
supporting this fishing proposal.
1:15:35
It goes back to what did they get right in the management plan.
1:15:38
I personally on my belief they got that right.
1:15:42
Now, a lot of people today are saying, hey, at the time a lot of
1:15:46
this was coming up it was 20 years later, and it was 25 years later.
1:15:51
Here you and I are sitting it’s 35 years later, but the point they were
1:15:54
making is, well, that was good for the time, but you know some people’s view
1:16:00
is we’ve learned what we can and it’s 25 years later, you need to allow more
1:16:05
access, you need people to experience it.
1:16:08
As we’re finding from the work that people like Charlie [Crisafulli] and Virginia
1:16:13
[Dale] and others are doing, we’re still learning lessons and we don’t know when
1:16:19
those lessons are going to cease, if ever.
1:16:23
Yet, it’s difficult when you’re not a scientist with that long-term view,
1:16:29
it’s difficult to understand why can’t we allow more public access.
1:16:35
Why can’t we have those experiences?
1:16:38
I think in the management plan some things that they really got right was
1:16:45
this idea of creating, again this is the people connection part, creating
1:16:50
different experiences so those hardened places where you’re going to bring
1:16:54
a whole lot of people, you know, you’re going to have a whole lot of
1:16:57
impact, like the visitors’ centers.
1:17:00
Then having a system to allow people to actually be out in the Monument and have
1:17:05
an experience like Mt. Margaret, and there’s only a certain kind of person
1:17:10
that’s going to ever have that experience.
1:17:12
And go to Mt. Margaret.
1:17:13
Many people will never go to Mt. Margaret.
1:17:15
They
1:17:17
couldn’t make the hike, or they wouldn’t want to do it [SS talks over LB]
1:17:18
. It’s a pretty steep mountain, too.
1:17:20
It’s very steep.
1:17:20
It’s challenging to get to.
1:17:22
It’s an amazing place, if you ever get there.
1:17:26
I believe you know today you’re seeing the Monument staff look at broadening some of
1:17:33
the experiences, so perhaps having more activities that happen on Coldwater Lake.
1:17:38
Right.
1:17:41
Finding ways to have [SS interrupts LB]
1:17:42
. That was a new lake after the eruption, correct?
1:17:44
Yes.
1:17:44
There are two lakes that were actually created by the flow
1:17:49
that occurred [SS interrupts LB]
1:17:49
. That blocked the little valleys.
1:17:51
Basically, blocked it off and created a new lake, and Coldwater is one of those.
1:17:56
So, they’re finding opportunities maybe for some canoe or kayak camping; you
1:18:00
know, we’re trying to again create different types of experiences for people.
1:18:09
What mistakes do you think they made?
1:18:11
Or, I won’t say mistakes that “they” made, but let’s say the political
1:18:15
process may have not permitted or things that could have been better. That’s
1:18:20
probably a better way of putting it.
1:18:22
You know one thing that I think we’re studying again today that’s one of
1:18:28
those questions about how would you do it different then, if you knew then
1:18:34
what you know now, is the installation of Spirit Lake Tunnel and then the
1:18:40
sediment retention dam down on the Toutle that the Corp [of Engineers] manages.
1:18:46
Part of the idea with the tunnel was mitigating the lake level that
1:18:50
should things occur there would be an ability to kind of control
1:18:55
what might occur downstream.
1:18:56
In other words, a big, huge mudflow lahar of an even, well, greater size than—
1:19:04
Greater size or even a similar size going down the Toutle River [in] . So,
1:19:09
one of the things that they wanted to do was to be able to control Spirit
1:19:15
Lake’s level should something major occur and so they’ve created this
1:19:19
tunnel and in theory you can allow water to flow out of that and manage it.
1:19:26
It has been a very challenging, a very, very challenging thing to manage.
1:19:34
I know there are many scientists who feel like it should have never been built.
1:19:38
It’s one of the things that has affected the dynamics.
1:19:41
In other words, they would classify it as classic over-engineering, correct?
1:19:47
Yes.
1:19:47
I think I’ve heard that word with it.
1:19:50
You know and again I go back to the day and time, and I try to put myself
1:19:54
in those times and go whether I would agree with it or not, I don’t know.
1:19:59
I can see with the intensity of what has occurred with the pressures around all
1:20:09
the impacts that occurred down the Toutle River, I can understand why there was a
1:20:16
push from a safety standpoint to do so.
1:20:19
I can also see the science side which is this is not allowing
1:20:24
ecological processes to occur.
1:20:27
The way that’s still playing out for the Forest Service,
1:20:33
the Corps built the tunnel.
1:20:35
There’s an agreement between them and the Forest Service that the
1:20:38
Forest Service would actually pay for the maintenance of the tunnel.
1:20:41
Well, the Corps, though, is the only ones who actually have the engineering
1:20:45
expertise, so every so often and if you’ve looked with binoculars at the inlet to
1:20:52
the tunnel you’ll often see the big log mat will come over and every so many
1:20:58
years there has to be something done to mitigate that because things are getting
1:21:02
jammed up by the inlet and it usually costs a million or two million dollars.
1:21:08
There’s a small log mat right now in front of it, but not the massive type that—
1:21:12
Not the massive ones that we’ve dealt with in the past.
1:21:14
And some of them start getting sucked into the intake.
1:21:16
They’ll get sucked into the intake and what we’ve had to do before, they’ll
1:21:20
actually fly in a big crane and they’ll set up buoys around and they’ll try
1:21:25
to use the crane to move things.
1:21:28
It generally will cost a million plus dollars.
1:21:32
What’s challenging as a manager is that’s a safety and health issue and
1:21:37
so, when it happens and we have to deal with it, there’s generally you can
1:21:41
find dollars to pay for that, and yet you look and think what could you have
1:21:47
done with that million dollars to help—
1:21:50
Something else.
1:21:51
Whether it’s to connect people with the place or to
1:21:56
deal with backlog maintenance on a road or to deal with something else.
1:22:00
Those are the things that’s much more challenging to get money for.
1:22:03
They create this deferred maintenance.
1:22:06
The part [of the reason] why the tunnel will get to be revisited is in this
1:22:13
last year rather than just the log mat question, there’s been this place where
1:22:18
it’s built kind of through a fault and the tunnel itself has had a shift and the
1:22:24
opening is much smaller in some places.
1:22:28
I don’t want to give you numbers, because I’ll give you the wrong numbers, but
1:22:32
that is leading to a more integrated look at what is the long-term solution here?
1:22:39
The solution may be simply to fix the tunnel.
1:22:42
It may not.
1:22:44
How do you believe the rainbow trout got into Spirit Lake?
1:22:48
What’s your opinion on that?
1:22:51
Well, I’ve heard various stories and for this.
1:22:56
I probably listen to Charlie Crisafulli more than anybody with the idea that,
1:23:03
given the nature of the fish and what not, that it likely was introduced by somebody.
1:23:11
A private interest?
1:23:12
Most likely.
1:23:13
Right.
1:23:14
Most likely.
1:23:15
Somebody with an axe to grind, maybe?
1:23:18
You know, I don’t know, that it’s an axe to grind so much as maybe somebody who
1:23:22
thought they were doing a good thing.
1:23:25
The axe to grind that you can experience is this idea of why do the researchers
1:23:29
get to go there, and I don’t?
1:23:32
Because that’s hard to understand, especially if you
1:23:36
were connected to this place.
1:23:38
Well, before, correct.
1:23:39
Well before the eruption, for many people, this is in their hearts and
1:23:47
this was their mountain and some of those people can’t come back.
1:23:52
They felt like the mountain betrayed them.
1:23:55
For other people, I think they feel like, because of the approaches we’ve
1:23:58
taken, that they’ve been cut out of some place that they actually probably
1:24:03
have more right to be than anybody else.
1:24:06
Whether you agree with that or not, I can understand their viewpoint.
1:24:11
So,
1:24:13
when you look at the why would somebody do it, I think we have to
1:24:16
be open to lots of different views.
1:24:19
One way that I often look at this is I like to—this is a thing I use
1:24:24
with my employees as a manager—is one is assume positive intent.
1:24:30
When we get some kind of thing that comes out of Washington, DC, like a new
1:24:35
travel system or something, you know, the people back in Washington aren’t sitting
1:24:39
there twiddling their thumbs and thinking how can we make their lives miserable?
1:24:43
What could we do to them now to take up productivity?
1:24:47
They’re doing something because they either need to follow some guidance
1:24:52
from the president or the Secretary of Agriculture or were trying to save money
1:24:57
and that initial impact is significant.
1:25:00
But they didn’t do it just to get us, even though we often feel that, and,
1:25:04
so, to help my employees sometimes not get into a negative place, [I
1:25:08
suggest they] assume positive intent.
1:25:10
And one thing, I ask them to do think at a minimum three alternative
1:25:15
explanations for something.
1:25:18
If you can come up with three alternative stories, then it at least broadens
1:25:24
your mind to not getting locked into especially a judgment that may not be
1:25:34
true.
1:25:34
One of the ways I try to look at this is, you know, you can easily get
1:25:41
into the negativity of we don’t have enough money or there aren’t enough
1:25:44
resources or I’m not allowed in or those scientists have locked me out.
1:25:50
So, one way that I really believe in public service and I think
1:25:54
that’s my job, is public service, [is that] I feel honored to be
1:25:58
entrusted to manage these lands.
1:25:59
So, I need to help my employees in particular to be able to think about that.
1:26:04
Instead of saying what we can’t do for example, because there’s so many
1:26:10
more things we could do with more resources, with more partnerships,
1:26:13
but instead of saying what we can’t do let’s tell people what we are doing.
1:26:17
Here at Mount St. Helens, yes, there are all kinds of things we could be
1:26:21
doing, but here’s what we are doing.
1:26:23
Let’s build from that story about things.
1:26:28
It’s one of the challenges, like the story on the fish.
1:26:31
One story could be, yep, we’re going to get those scientists, because
1:26:36
they locked us out of here and we’re going to mess up their research.
1:26:41
Another story could be this was my place and I really want to come back there some
1:26:47
day and if there’s these big fish they’re going to let me come back and fish because
1:26:53
I know, someday, we’ll be able to do it.
1:26:56
Another story could be some weird airplane pilot flew over the lake
1:27:00
sometime and threw a fish in.
1:27:03
You can get kind of weird, but... And the challenge is
1:27:09
that you have to figure out today does it matter what the answer is.
1:27:14
In some cases it really does matter, because if somebody is doing it
1:27:18
with a negative intent to negatively affect say what we’re learning or
1:27:24
because they believe that by doing that it’s going to mean that the
1:27:29
unimpeded process is no longer valid.
1:27:31
And, so, you’ve got to let people in, then it really matters to understand it and to
1:27:35
be able to manage that and deal with it.
1:27:39
If it’s one of those things where it’s more about how we move forward and
1:27:48
what are we going to do today, if you get stuck in that place of believing
1:27:53
that people are out to get you, then it can be much more challenging to
1:27:58
think about how do I believe coalitions that really believe in this work.
1:28:04
Whether it’s managing my employees in the scenic area, where we
1:28:07
struggle—we have millions of people visiting a very small area.
1:28:11
We’re one of the most visited places in the National Forest System.
1:28:16
I’ll bet.
1:28:16
Parking lots are filled [SS interrupts LB]
1:28:17
. Are you talking about—?
1:28:18
At the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.
1:28:20
Okay, right, right.
1:28:21
We struggle because we’re overwhelmed.
1:28:23
How
1:28:25
many people do you have on staff?
1:28:26
Our total staff is about 49 and about half of those, though, work in fire.
1:28:30
The number of folks that I have that are trying to deal with the
1:28:34
ecological piece specifically and/or the recreation piece, we have 15 or 16
1:28:43
of us and in the summer, we grow quite a bit.
1:28:47
But it’s really challenging.
1:28:49
It’s very easy there to get in the mood of we don’t really even get to set a
1:28:56
course of action that we believe needs to happen, because we’re either overwhelmed
1:29:00
by visitors or by political interests or by friends groups who believe that what
1:29:06
they want to do is the right thing to do.
1:29:09
You have to find a way through that, because otherwise you can just drive
1:29:13
yourself crazy, get ulcers, feel frustrated, not serve the public well,
1:29:20
and it’s one of the things that, back to your question of what did they get
1:29:25
right and what did they get wrong, is
1:29:30
I think in many of these places that were designated, and this is maybe a
1:29:35
bigger picture view—Mount St. Helens, the act passed in 1982, the Columbia River
1:29:42
Gorge Scenic Area Act in 1986, and in the State of Oregon there were a number
1:29:49
of wild and scenic rivers designated.
1:29:52
A lot of people have an image, and probably not so much with younger people
1:29:57
today, but in my generation, who had an image in their minds of Senator Hatfield
1:30:03
and what they believed he was about and all this kind of perspective about timber
1:30:08
and harvesting and, yet, if you were to go back and look at the congressionally
1:30:14
designated areas that he helped influence and set aside and help be a guiding
1:30:19
force behind, you would be amazed at the number of places he had his fingers on.
1:30:24
The last one before he retired was the Opal Creek area in the
1:30:27
Willamette National Forest up out of the Detroit Ranger District.
1:30:33
He was driven about resolving the conflict because it was a conflict and
1:30:37
finding a way through that and they came up with things like a recreation area.
1:30:41
There’s a part of it in wilderness, a part of it in management.
1:30:45
You go back and look at those bits and pieces and it was some of the,
1:30:52
in many ways it was some of the last efforts where we were
1:30:55
finding our way through solutions.
1:30:57
Yes, sometimes they were politically negotiated solutions and compromises and
1:31:02
yet it’s amazing that we have them today.
1:31:08
One of the things that I like to do rather than, because I’m not as embedded
1:31:14
in the research as the scientists are here at Mount St. Helens, I like to think
1:31:19
at the more global perspective and so pull myself up to that higher level and
1:31:24
visualize the landscape of all these places that got designated and think about
1:31:29
how amazing it was, that period of time.
1:31:36
If you start listing all these places out, looking at the designated
1:31:40
rivers, you can see a real comparison between Oregon and Washington.
1:31:44
Look at the number of rivers—and I’m not going to give you the
1:31:47
number, because I’d be wrong.
1:31:48
That’s okay.
1:31:48
The number of rivers in Oregon and there are very few wild and scenic
1:31:52
rivers in the State of Washington.
1:31:53
That’s true, yeah.
1:31:55
A piece of that is that moment in time and
1:32:01
a time when the way the congressional process was working still
1:32:06
facilitated—there was certainly a lot of trading that was going on
1:32:09
and such, and yet it facilitated finding your way through those.
1:32:14
To me, that’s one of the lessons that I like to take away.
1:32:20
That’s probably the relevant part I can share with you because again I’m
1:32:23
not as immersed in it as the scientists were that the land use designations
1:32:29
are probably the bigger concern.
1:32:38
We are at, what lookout point is this, Lynn?
1:32:43
We’re at Strawberry
1:32:45
Mountain Viewpoint.
1:32:48
If you look off to the west, we’re looking down the Green River drainage and one of
1:32:52
the things that you can notice as you scan the horizon is you see places where you
1:32:57
don’t notice any down material, others where you can see the trees are all down
1:33:02
and they’re gray and they’re pointed towards us and then some places where
1:33:06
you see a few, occasional standing dead.
1:33:09
And then, the amazing thing when you look out, is that you
1:33:12
also see standing green trees.
1:33:15
For me, this is one of the phenomenal experiences when I worked here.
1:33:19
You would be in an area where all these big, giant 6’ diameter trees
1:33:24
were tooth picked and scattered around.
1:33:27
You come around the corner and see standing dead and then all of a sudden
1:33:30
as you wandered across, you’d be on this ribbon of green trees where
1:33:35
the blast really hadn’t affected.
1:33:37
There may be a little dusting in the understory, and it was like
1:33:41
this just odd transition from standing dead to green trees.
1:33:48
That was just a phenomenal experience and it was hard, as you
1:33:51
were out there, to even visualize how the movement had come through.
1:33:57
Here we’re seeing a variety of those parts of pieces.
1:34:01
Some of it is the natural regeneration that is in the foreground
1:34:04
there where you see are those probably silver fir or noble fir?
1:34:09
Probably they’re silver fir and noble fir.
1:34:11
There’s a lot of noble fir up this high.
1:34:13
Because we’re up a little higher, right?
1:34:14
Yes.
1:34:14
We’re up in fairly high elevation, so you are looking at some noble fir here.
1:34:20
Then you’ll see some true firs.
1:34:26
Looking down through the Green River Valley you’ll see it’s
1:34:30
definitely quite reforested compared to what we’re looking south at.
1:34:35
And you look at this landscape today, 35 years later, you were
1:34:38
here after basically year one.
1:34:40
Mm-hm, year one.
1:34:42
What’s the difference between the first time you would
1:34:44
have seen this versus today?
1:34:47
So, the tremendous difference, of course, is that it’s green.
1:34:52
At that time everything was pretty much shades of gray unless you
1:34:56
were along the edge of things.
1:34:59
That was either through the coating of things that had
1:35:01
happened or what had come through.
1:35:04
So, you see a lot, a lot of green through here.
1:35:07
I think we’re seeing, obviously, some of the regeneration has grown taller,
1:35:13
whether it was survived by being under snow or whether it’s come in naturally.
1:35:19
You’re seeing a height difference in things and you’re starting to
1:35:24
see much more of a patch mosaic of what’s out on the landscape.
1:35:28
Exactly.
1:35:30
It’s maturing.
1:35:31
It’s maturing.
1:35:32
Slowly, but it’s maturing.
1:35:33
One of the other things, and it’s not totally obvious here, but we
1:35:37
talk about this over at the visitor centers, is some of the standing
1:35:42
dead trees are starting to fall down.
1:35:45
So, the trees that were left standing they hadn’t been blown over.
1:35:49
As time has gone by, 35 years is a long time.
1:35:52
That root structure is gone and what not.
1:35:55
At Coldwater, what used to be Coldwater Visitor Center and is now the Learning
1:36:00
Center, there are actually some sideways trees and what not that aren’t really
1:36:04
trees because they knew in order to have people have that experience,
1:36:09
they needed to create that because it wasn’t going to last naturally.
1:36:14
You can’t really tell that here, but if we look up the hill you can see
1:36:18
there’s still some standing dead and there’s some that are tilted over.
1:36:22
Some of those that are laying down they probably came down in more recent years.
1:36:28
They didn’t come down as part of the blast.
1:36:31
We’re looking at a combination of the blast zone and the scorch zone.
1:36:36
A little bit of an interface of both.
1:36:37
Correct.
1:36:37
A little bit of interface.
1:36:38
Up here’s it’s a little bit of I’d guess you’d say a scorch zone
1:36:41
because there’s standing dead and you can see it on the other side
1:36:44
of that little knob in front of us.
1:36:46
Yeah, and off to our north and our west is where you started hitting the zone
1:36:52
where it really started fading out.
1:36:55
Again, you get the edge of the green.
1:36:57
The area that I worked in which was called Miners Creek which is definitely farther
1:37:02
to out west you could wander that line between what was amazing you could be
1:37:08
in a scorch zone and everything was gray and it was hot and it beat down on you
1:37:13
and then you could actually move over 5 feet and you were in a green forest.
1:37:19
If you didn’t look back towards the scorch zone you wouldn’t know it was there.
1:37:24
That was one of the most phenomenal, meaningful ah-ha’s to
1:37:29
me about just the way nature is.
1:37:31
You could almost make an analogy, although this is a bigger scope, to
1:37:35
tornadic activity, where tornados will completely destroy certain areas and
1:37:40
then they won’t touch anything else.
1:37:43
Then they’ll move around.
1:37:43
Yeah and the way that they will move down and pop in and out.
1:37:47
Obviously, this happened in different ways, and yet I
1:37:49
think that’s a great analogy.
1:37:51
You ready to move on?
1:37:53
You bet.
1:37:58
What do you think the cultural place of Mount St. Helens is
1:38:03
within the Pacific Northwest and extending that to U.S. history?
1:38:11
Great question.
1:38:13
So, within the Pacific Northwest, it’s an interesting one in my mind, because
1:38:19
you have all the things that you hear about, like Rainier is this image people
1:38:22
have and it almost supersedes a place like Mount St. Helens, even though
1:38:31
you have all this that’s occurred.
1:38:34
One of the intriguing things for me is that within the sense of
1:38:37
the Northwest, I think it’s here.
1:38:41
I think it’s an important place and I think it actually in my mind
1:38:45
somewhat gets lost in between Mt. Hood and Mt. Rainier as physical places.
1:38:52
But when I think about it in the context of U.S. history, or even the world, but
1:38:57
particularly U.S. with it being in an eruptive phase during the lifetime of a
1:39:05
number of people in the continental 48 states with the amount of coverage it
1:39:12
had it’s one of the iconic things that people remember where they were when.
1:39:20
For a whole generation, I think, it has a really special connection.
1:39:26
It’s like, and I don’t want to liken it to the Twin Towers thing, but it’s sort
1:39:30
of those you remember where you were when Kennedy was assassinated; you remember
1:39:34
where you were when you learned about the Twin Towers; you remember where you
1:39:38
were when Mount St. Helens went off.
1:39:42
I think it has a place in our psyche as a society.
1:39:46
Now that’s changing a little bit as we get out there where it’s 35 years past
1:39:50
the blast and there’s a lot of people now who weren’t even born when it erupted.
1:39:57
So,
1:40:00
I think that’s shifting a bit in terms of how it’s seen and how it’s experienced.
1:40:09
That’s probably where I would stop and see where you want to go next.
1:40:13
For you personally what is the place cultural or otherwise of Mount St. Helens.
1:40:20
You’ve talked about it it’s like hugely impactful thing in your life, one of your
1:40:25
favorites, if not your favorite place.
1:40:27
Tell me why.
1:40:28
Explain.
1:40:28
I
1:40:32
think for me it’s one of those places where I really became
1:40:36
aware of how small we as a species are in the place of things.
1:40:45
We’re so engaged in the world and we have so many impacts and we have all these
1:40:49
things we can invent and make, and yet being in the blast zone right after or
1:40:56
in that year after the eruption and just seeing the power of nature and the forces
1:41:02
that had occurred and the way in which they interacted with each other, it gave
1:41:08
me a whole different perspective on the place of humanity, not only on this world,
1:41:13
but as I think about the solar system.
1:41:16
It’s an interesting.
1:41:18
I don’t know why this is coming to mind, but with the pictures
1:41:21
that are coming back from Pluto.
1:41:23
It’s amazing to me that as a society that we can invent things that can
1:41:27
travel for decades and take pictures and send them back to places that are—
1:41:32
Four billion miles away.
1:41:33
That are amazing distances away and you just think about how do we even
1:41:39
conceive of those kinds of things?
1:41:42
What amazing things are out there in the universe.
1:41:44
For me one of the connections about this place is it has so many
1:41:50
different parts and pieces that mean so many different things to folks.
1:41:57
And just experiencing the power of nature the degree to which we are
1:42:03
very small within that and it sort of changed my trajectory of thinking.
1:42:11
I’m an experiential learner in many ways and that was an experience
1:42:18
that most people don’t ever get to have and so I think that’s one
1:42:22
of the foundational people for me.
1:42:24
Another piece is, as a manager, one of the things that’s really important is I think
1:42:31
I’ve mentioned earlier is that idea of connecting people and I really believe one
1:42:36
of my roles is I believe in public lands.
1:42:40
I love the National Forest and I also believe in public lands in general and
1:42:46
one thing that’s really important to me is having those be relevant to people as
1:42:51
we go out in society, so that this great idea of the federal lands is still of
1:42:58
value to folks 10, 15, 30 years from now.
1:43:02
One of the really neat cultural aspects of a place like Mt. St. Helens
1:43:06
is it can connect people to that.
1:43:09
There can be a whole lot of national forests and people might go there
1:43:12
or not or the local people go there and yet this is one of those places
1:43:17
people come from all around the world and in part because it’s accessible.
1:43:22
There might even be volcanos in their own country, but they can’t get to them.
1:43:26
Here they can come, and they can have wonder and awe and be amazed and value
1:43:34
that experience, so I think having places like this helps people make the
1:43:40
connection that values public lands which will help value things that they
1:43:46
don’t understand as well, and hopefully keep that for future generations.
1:43:52
How has St. Helens and what has happened here since ’80 affected
1:43:58
the management of other volcanos in the Northwest or areas around.
1:44:03
Rainier would be the obvious one, but you’ve got Baker, Hood, those would
1:44:09
be the ones that I would think of that are considered potentially eruptive.
1:44:13
I think Adams less so.
1:44:14
It’s a less frequent erupter.
1:44:16
Jefferson hasn’t erupted in a long time.
1:44:18
South Sister is—
1:44:20
It’s got its little bulge.
1:44:23
The most significant way that I think when you think about that is
1:44:28
what’s happened with the Cascade Volcanoes Observatory and the network
1:44:31
there and the work they do through
1:44:36
USGS.
1:44:36
One of the things that they were tasked to do, and I think they’re
1:44:41
now finished with it was to come up with, in essence, a volcano plan for
1:44:45
each of these potential volcanos, which we didn’t really have before.
1:44:50
Even with St. Helens, we had our plan after the eruption and yet it was one
1:44:55
of those it became hard to keep it a priority, even to keep it up to date.
1:44:59
So, like, when I came to the forest in 2000, I tasked the fire management
1:45:05
officer, who was also our volcano emergency response coordinator,
1:45:09
with [the task to] make sure that plan’s ready and up to date.
1:45:12
He’s like, oh yeah.
1:45:13
Well and then when it did start erupting, it was like, “Oh, now I get why we should
1:45:18
have it.” But through that work in 2004, 2005 there’s actually a paper that was
1:45:25
included in one of the compendiums about the response network and the emergency
1:45:30
management coordination and it was after that USGS put a primary focus on
1:45:38
coming up with a plan for each volcano.
1:45:40
So, that’s one specific way it’s really affected it.
1:45:44
What is the general gist of those plans and basically
1:45:47
emergency public safety focus?
1:45:51
Those are primarily that, if something started happening, who are
1:45:56
the partners you’re working with.
1:45:57
What do you have to do depending on what’s going on?
1:46:01
How would you evacuate people?
1:46:04
What are the early warning things and conceptually you keep it up
1:46:07
to date with the names and phone numbers of contacts and what not?
1:46:11
I think the other piece where it’s effective, again this is primarily USGS,
1:46:16
is that idea of the sensing and the ability to do monitoring and depending
1:46:24
on who you are, of course, there’s much more here with Mount St. Helens then there
1:46:29
was a desire to have more other places.
1:46:33
Again, when the volcano started re-erupting in a different format
1:46:38
in 2004, 2005 we actually had folks who came down from Alaska Volcano
1:46:43
Observatory and they got to experience it, because they’ve had experiences
1:46:49
up there, but not the same ones.
1:46:51
What we learned in that eruption was the people management.
1:46:55
In St. Helens?
1:46:56
At St. Helens here in 2004.
1:46:59
The nature of it, you know, most of the top of the mountain had been
1:47:02
gone in 1980 and the subsequent one so when this eruption happened
1:47:08
there was the whaleback [lava dome in the crater] starting coming up.
1:47:12
It’s the toothpaste thing.
1:47:13
It started filling in the dome.
1:47:16
It cut the glacier in half and then the glacier came back around.
1:47:20
We have one of the only growing glaciers in the world.
1:47:23
So, what the modern-day media what became of our event was managing media.
1:47:30
Twice a day down at the forest headquarters we were doing press
1:47:34
briefings and USGS folks would come over and we would be doing those.
1:47:39
And then I believe we had 16 to 20 satellite trucks that were up near
1:47:45
Coldwater Ridge trying to constantly be taking images of the volcano
1:47:51
and so we were doing daily press briefings there for over a month.
1:47:58
I remember one time Willie Scott, who was at USGS, was doing the briefing and they
1:48:04
asked him something about what happens when [an eruption occurs] and right then,
1:48:08
of course, they were showing their little TV thing and right then the mountain
1:48:13
started spitting stuff, and he went, “Oh, you mean like right now?” So, it was that
1:48:19
difference in timing where here we were 25 years after the original eruption,
1:48:23
and you could basically, because of the electronic equipment we have today, you
1:48:28
were watching it happen in [real] time.
1:48:30
Wow.
1:48:31
And the world was watching it.
1:48:33
Wow.
1:48:34
That was basically a lava dome.
1:48:36
It was a dome building eruption.
1:48:38
There was a harmonic tremor that scared people a lot.
1:48:42
Was it a 5?
1:48:45
I don’t recall.
1:48:46
Yeah.
1:48:47
One of the learnings I had thinking about the cultural piece was we
1:48:53
reopened Johnston Ridge to the public after a while—we didn’t close
1:48:56
the entire side off and there were some people from USGS, who were
1:49:03
really concerned about that.
1:49:05
About what?
1:49:06
That we weren’t closing enough area off.
1:49:09
I couldn’t quite understand what was going on because again the volcano
1:49:13
wasn’t going to likely do like it did in 1980 and one of the ah-ha’s it took
1:49:19
me a while to figure out is I realized that for some of those folks they were
1:49:24
struggling with what had happened in 1980 and the idea that people had died
1:49:28
and it was some of the same scientists—
1:49:33
On their watch, so to speak.
1:49:33
And it had happened on their watch and they were scared it would
1:49:35
happen again, and it was a really interesting learning for me.
1:49:40
I think the one other thing I mentioned, and this isn’t so much about volcanos,
1:49:44
I think we’re learning a whole lot through the monitoring of the way the
1:49:49
ecological process is working that’s informing how we manage forests and
1:49:54
what are all the parts and pieces and how do they interact together.
1:49:58
In many ways, that is one of the most substantive offerings
1:50:04
of the lessons that are here.
1:50:07
Now, is there any relationship in terms of management plans to Lassen?
1:50:14
It’s at the southern tip of the Cascades.
1:50:16
It had a pretty major eruption, although not on the scale of this.
1:50:20
It’s a dormant volcano, you could say active, but—
1:50:23
I don’t think there’s a real strong connection.
1:50:26
It doesn’t mean there couldn’t be.
1:50:28
I think there’s things we learn from seeing what happened in Mount
1:50:31
St. Helens that it’d help explain what you see physically at Lassen.
1:50:35
You know the little hammocks that they had never understood what
1:50:38
those were and then all of a sudden it went, Oh, that’s what that is.”
1:50:42
The debris avalanche on the north side, right?
1:50:44
Yeah, and so but in terms of the say the two forests connecting I don’t think so.
1:50:53
US Geological Survey with the work that the Cascades Volcano Observatory
1:50:58
do they have a variety of papers, a number of things about Rainier and Hood
1:51:04
and different ones about being ready.
1:51:07
I think where the connection from a management side with Mount St.
1:51:11
Helens has actually been more with Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
1:51:16
Where that is, is because some of the folks who worked here after the initial
1:51:21
eruption on getting the interpretation things ready and basically putting
1:51:27
together world-class service for folks, really demonstrating the Forest
1:51:33
Service has a strong skill in those.
1:51:36
One of those folks wound up working over at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
1:51:41
and we did things like ranger exchanges where one of their folks would come up
1:51:46
here to Mount St. Helens and work at Johnston Ridge, and one of our folks
1:51:51
would go there and learn some things.
1:51:53
So, we’ve had that kind of employee exchange.
1:51:56
So,
1:51:59
how well do you think that the Forest Service has become at managing
1:52:03
parks and monuments, or monuments is essentially a park with a different name.
1:52:08
It was fairly new a while ago, now there’s quite a few.
1:52:12
What’s your take on that?
1:52:14
And you can focus on this but a general comment.
1:52:18
You know the Forest Service in large part we actually have a wide range
1:52:22
of elements to the Forest Service.
1:52:25
We have the National Forest System Lands, which would include National Forest,
1:52:29
National Grasslands, National Monuments, National Recreation Areas and all those.
1:52:34
Before I talk about them, I’m going to mention we also have a series
1:52:38
of other deputy areas that many people never know about and one
1:52:42
of them is International Forestry.
1:52:45
We provide technical resources to many countries around the world who
1:52:50
will ask for assistance around things.
1:52:53
We have a branch that’s around state and private forestry which is a very strong
1:52:59
linkage with the states around things.
1:53:03
One piece that’s relevant here is we have the largest research
1:53:06
organization around the world, the research branch of our agency.
1:53:11
Sometimes people think of the Forest Service as it’s that land base, and
1:53:17
I just want to mention there’s these other pieces that kind of get lost and
1:53:22
most people never know about that are actually helping inform land management
1:53:27
and providing service on a broad scale.
1:53:30
Which really expanded dramatically in the ‘70s and ’80s.
1:53:35
The invasion of the
1:53:38
-ologists, or whatever you want to call it.
1:53:39
Yeah, well, and the piece that happened then was you know we’ve had different
1:53:45
eras in the management of the forests.
1:53:48
The initial phase of setting up was actually to protect them
1:53:52
from some of the things that were moving across from the east coast.
1:53:57
We actually had some primitive areas and the concept of
1:54:01
wilderness areas back in the 1930s.
1:54:03
A lot of folks don’t realize that.
1:54:07
Primitive areas, yeah.
1:54:07
As we moved into World War II, there was quite a bit of work done where
1:54:11
the National Forest provided a lot of material to build airplanes, spruce
1:54:16
for airplanes, that kind of thing.
1:54:20
In the late ‘50s, early ‘60s, a lot of it was providing a lot of wood products for
1:54:26
all the houses for the emerging society.
1:54:29
Baby boomers, yeah.
1:54:30
So, a big chunk of our workforce managing at that time was foresters
1:54:36
and engineers.
1:54:37
In the evolution of the ‘60s we had all kinds of acts: the Multiple-Use
1:54:43
Sustained-Yield Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, Wild and
1:54:46
Scenic Rivers, you know NEPA, those kinds of things and then in the early
1:54:51
‘70s with the Monongahela and the Bitterroot decisions led to the National
1:54:56
Forest Management Act, which is what you were calling the -ologist thing.
1:55:01
We started diversifying what our skills sets was and really incorporating a
1:55:06
much more integrated capacity, so we’ll have folks: hydrologists, wildlife
1:55:11
biologists, fisheries biologists, landscape architects, that whole
1:55:15
suite of folks and then working in a really integrated fashion to
1:55:20
think about integrated activities.
1:55:24
So, we’ve been through a variety of evolution over
1:55:28
what’s a land and resource plan.
1:55:31
Here in the Northwest we had what was called the Northwest Forest Plan which
1:55:35
then got incorporated into each plan.
1:55:40
We’re now in the process, a new planning rule came out a couple years ago, I think
1:55:47
2012 I guess it was, which is redefining how we’ll do plan revision for the future.
1:55:55
So, all those things affect this and the learnings from Mount St. Helens I said
1:56:04
earlier the things that we’re learning about the parts and pieces and what’s
1:56:09
left behind, and if you’re doing active management or even how you approach
1:56:14
what might be called restoration of an aquatic system, those kinds of things.
1:56:19
There’s many lessons from here.
1:56:21
We learn from a lot of different places, but much great information
1:56:26
has come from St. Helens.
1:56:28
Back to your question on managing “parks or monuments,” you know one of the
1:56:36
pieces that I think, our budget process is not well-suited for these because
1:56:43
we, so for example the Park Service has a place-based budget. So, Mt. Rainier
1:56:49
gets a place budget and then they get to compete for special programs. In the
1:56:55
Forest Service, it’s a program-based budget and you compete based on outcomes.
1:57:01
One of the things we’re in the process of exploring is what would be different
1:57:06
if we were valuing people and place and linking those together so some work we’ve
1:57:11
done here in the Pacific Northwest Region we’ve actually done focus groups in a
1:57:16
variety of communities and employees.
1:57:19
We have a suite of concepts that I won’t go into in great detail, but
1:57:25
there’s four big ideas to it and it’s the notion that nature matters
1:57:29
and nature provides and we find the greatest good by being in community.
1:57:35
Those are concepts that apply across the board and we’re exploring how
1:57:41
can we be more effective at that.
1:57:43
So, you see the agency move much more towards collaboration and
1:57:47
collaborative groups and things.
1:57:50
That said, a lot of our focus may be on how do you deal with say ecological
1:57:57
systems that are out of balance, so the east side with fire situation, and less
1:58:03
so on how do you manage a place like the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic
1:58:07
Area, where I’ve got a unique mission.
1:58:10
My mission is not about producing wood products or different things,
1:58:14
but it’s about protecting and enhancing the cultural, scenic
1:58:17
natural resource and recreation.
1:58:19
Which is a preservation, Park Service type mandate.
1:58:22
It’s more along those kinds of lines.
1:58:24
Although, the other part of it, there’s a second purpose and that is to help
1:58:29
facilitate economic activity to the degree that you achieve the original purpose.
1:58:35
So, it’s kind of a got a little bit of both.
1:58:38
Our budget process is not set up around how do you fund that kind of work.
1:58:44
I think we’re in an exploration mode.
1:58:47
We have an interesting suite of unusual places in that there are
1:58:52
several national volcanic monuments.
1:58:55
There’s actually another one in Oregon, the Newberry Crater Monument.
1:58:58
That’s right, yeah.
1:58:59
Over on the Deschutes.
1:59:01
We have places like the National Scenic Area I manage.
1:59:04
We’ve got the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Hells
1:59:07
Canyon National Recreation Area.
1:59:10
Over in Idaho we have Sawtooth and you hear National Recreation Area,
1:59:14
and you go, “Oh, well they all must be the same.” And yet they’re not.
1:59:18
Their underlying legislation says what their purposes are.
1:59:21
So, all of them are a little different.
1:59:22
Yeah.
1:59:24
So, if you hear the word monument or you hear the word National Recreation
1:59:28
Area, you have to kind of remember that that you have to go to the
1:59:33
organic legislation of each place to see what the real purpose is.
1:59:39
I think we’re learning and we’re doing better at that.
1:59:42
I think it’s a skill.
1:59:45
In many ways one of the neat things about it, which is slightly different
1:59:50
than the National Park Service, is that if you go back to our founding
1:59:56
principles around finding the greatest good, it’s a slightly different approach.
2:00:01
It isn’t just protect and enhance.
2:00:03
It’s recognize that that greatest good is going to change over time and yet you’ve
2:00:09
got this role of nature is providing all kinds of different things out here.
2:00:16
Think about the information that’s being provided.
2:00:19
You think about the recreation experiences folks are having.
2:00:25
Just one thing that we heard from folks in our focus groups was that people
2:00:31
come here because it’s iconic landscape.
2:00:33
They love the waterfalls, the rivers, the mountains, and it didn’t matter
2:00:37
what their political spectrum was or what their views are of, well,
2:00:41
should you cut trees or not cut trees.
2:00:44
What’s really amazing is many people value the same thing.
2:00:49
They can’t always talk about it.
2:00:51
I do think places like this let people come together and
2:00:55
at least have that dialogue.
2:00:57
For a while, anyway.
2:00:57
Yeah.
2:01:04
The salvage logging work—they went crazy and they were really busy.
2:01:12
Tell me about that.
2:01:12
We maybe mentioned it at the start, but we did not go into details, so
2:01:16
that it something that I would be remiss if we did not
2:01:20
include.
2:01:22
Great question, so there was a variety of things that happened with the
2:01:26
salvage logging here after the eruption.
2:01:31
For example, Weyerhaeuser started almost immediately logging and replanting and,
2:01:38
because of the nature of private lands, and the way that was structured, they
2:01:42
could do that very quickly and they did.
2:01:46
With the Forest Service, one of the pieces that we do is go through
2:01:51
the National Environmental Policy Act and so there was a team,
2:01:56
actually, an interdisciplinary team.
2:01:58
Again, we talked a little earlier: a hydrologist, a life biologist, fisheries
2:02:02
biologist that worked on an environmental analysis to think about how you do that.
2:02:09
So, two things happened.
2:02:11
One is that they identified harvest activities and areas and then
2:02:18
once they had a sense of what the actual Monument boundaries were going
2:02:22
to be, it wasn’t until that that on the National Forest that they
2:02:26
started actually doing the operations.
2:02:30
For example, one of the areas where I did some planning, as we talked
2:02:33
earlier, some of that area was actually transferred to Weyerhaeuser and then some
2:02:40
of their lands came into the Monument.
2:02:42
That was a tradeoff.
2:02:43
Yeah, and so they traded area up here where along the Road 99 to the Windy Ridge
2:02:52
and we’ve drove along places where harvest had occurred.
2:02:56
At that time probably within that year after one of the things the Forest
2:03:02
Service did was try and say, “Okay, how do you do this?” Many of these
2:03:06
trees were case hardened. Just from the heat. It was like, if you tried to
2:03:12
hammer a rock into them, you couldn’t.
2:03:14
They’re still alive, but—
2:03:15
Yeah, or they were dead, but they were almost like concrete.
2:03:21
A lot of them had different things in them.
2:03:27
In putting the sales together, this is sort of an oddball factoid, but at the
2:03:33
time in the early ‘80s many companies had paid a whole lot of money when they were
2:03:41
[expecting to be] cutting older trees.
2:03:42
They maybe had overbid some sales and there were some economic challenges
2:03:47
going on in the Northwest at the time in terms of things and some of the
2:03:52
things that happened is, if you were a timber company and you bought one of
2:03:56
the salvage sales from Mount St. Helens [area] , you got what’s called contract
2:03:59
term adjustment on your other sales.
2:04:02
If your contract was 5 years long and it was going to take you 2 years to do a sale
2:04:08
up here, you got 2 extra years to do that, which really could help them economically.
2:04:14
One reason they did that was to give people an incentive to buy the sales.
2:04:20
Another thing that happened is that, although there were a lot of large
2:04:25
trees and a lot of wood material, it was really challenging, one, to
2:04:30
move it out and, second, to mill it.
2:04:33
Things like
2:04:37
the saw chains and then when they actually had the saw blades
2:04:40
at the mills with the kind of conditions that the material was in.
2:04:46
[the tephra abraded the blades of chainsaws and blades in sawmills]
2:04:47
Because they were so hardened.
2:04:47
Because it was hardened.
2:04:48
There was so much dust.
2:04:49
There was so much of the volcanic pumice.
2:04:52
It just really affected the mechanical things.
2:04:57
You actually had people to my recollection, and I’m getting old
2:05:02
enough now I could be forgetting things, I remember thinking there
2:05:06
was a mill that was down in Medford that was hauling from here at Mount
2:05:12
St. Helens down to Medford, Oregon.
2:05:15
Again, you think about why would they?
2:05:17
A piece of that’s probably around the economic part.
2:05:23
You had a pretty active thing going.
2:05:25
There were a lot of logging trucks thorough the area.
2:05:29
One of the objectives, of course, was a concern about, just like after a fire,
2:05:37
that you don’t have a lot of vegetation on the soils and if you got a lot of
2:05:40
deep soils and you get heavy rains that we’re going to have a lot of erosion.
2:05:46
Some of those things that scientists were concerned about, about well why are
2:05:49
they planting or why are they seeding.
2:05:51
From a managerial standpoint, it’s one of those things that you learn to
2:05:55
do to actually help stabilize things.
2:06:00
It gives you that nexus point where there can be different opinions about things.
2:06:07
I do not remember how much volume they took out of here.
2:06:13
I should remember it, but I don’t.
2:06:15
It was hundreds of millions of board feet.
2:06:19
A lot of that was in the Clearwater drainage.
2:06:23
What were the rules about how to do salvage logging?
2:06:29
In terms of rules?
2:06:30
[Wind obstructs audio] What were they required to do?
2:06:35
The access, the [win obstructs audio] resources, etc.
2:06:40
A lot of that is figured out when we do our environmental analysis,
2:06:44
whether it’s salvage logging or using vegetation management to create a
2:06:50
different landscape conditioning and whether you do a stewardship
2:06:54
sale today or, you know, a timber sale, it’s through our environmental
2:07:00
analysis that we look at how wide a riparian stream buffer might you leave.
2:07:07
Do you leave standing trees?
2:07:08
How much down woody material do you leave, that kind of thing.
2:07:12
That gets determined in the environmental analysis and then it’s supposed to
2:07:16
be translated into the contract.
2:07:19
We would lay out in the contract,
2:07:23
and I’m going to make something up: let’s say you actually had some
2:07:30
shrubs going along a riparian area.
2:07:32
It might be that for 200 ft on either side of the stream you wouldn’t
2:07:37
be doing situations in there.
2:07:40
In a regular sale
2:07:45
you might have designated say 8 large trees per acre that they’d leave.
2:07:49
You might have so many snags you’d be asking them to leave.
2:07:53
That would have been a part of that.
2:07:56
Again, it’s through the contract.
2:07:58
We would put in those conditions and then we have what’s called a sale administrator
2:08:05
who is actually out there with the contractor and it’s their job to know the
2:08:10
contract, to know what’s required, and to be monitoring on the ground to make sure
2:08:14
the contractor is actually doing that.
2:08:18
Sometimes that can be challenging, especially if it’s a helicopter
2:08:22
sale and it’s a long haul away.
2:08:25
You mean helicopter sale, you mean?
2:08:28
A helicopter sale would be where you’re using a helicopter as
2:08:31
a way to remove the material.
2:08:33
To pull the logs, right.
2:08:34
Most of what was done out here, there’s probably three different types of logging.
2:08:39
One is what’s called ground base equipment.
2:08:41
Maybe a rubber tire skidder or tractor.
2:08:44
Another would be cable logging, and that can be where you might drag one end of the
2:08:49
log, you lift one end and drag one end.
2:08:52
It might be where you have what’s called full suspension: the log is
2:08:54
lifted off the ground and you have a tower and you put a cable out a certain
2:08:54
distance and tie it off somewhere, and then, [third, there’s] helicopter
2:08:54
[where] you’re just flying the logs out.
2:09:07
So, the sale administrator’s job is to be out there checking things,
2:09:11
make sure they’re doing it, and
2:09:16
in different sales, in different operators, you kind of learn a little
2:09:21
bit about who to pay attention to—
2:09:25
Doing things.
2:09:25
Need to watch them.
2:09:25
What the quality is.
2:09:28
There are mechanisms in the sale.
2:09:30
Let’s say, if we learn that there was going to be untoward environmental
2:09:34
damage from something that was not recognized initially, there actually
2:09:41
is a mechanism in the sale contract to terminate the contract for that.
2:09:48
That requires our Washington office Chief’s approval.
2:09:52
There’s a whole series of things.
2:09:56
Oftentimes, the contracts will be several inches thick.
2:10:00
We do inspection reports and all that kind of thing.
2:10:03
How long do you remember it took for the Forest Service to address the
2:10:07
salvage logging issue on their lands.
2:10:10
Obviously, you didn’t have any say on the Weyerhaeuser lands.
2:10:12
Correct.
2:10:13
But was there still concerns, even with on the Weyerhaeuser lands because of
2:10:15
how it would affect erosion dynamics?
2:10:20
I think the Forest Service was paying primary attention to how they would
2:10:25
be managing the national forest lands and there’s a mix of conditions here
2:10:32
where the lands that are to the west or the east of Road 99 are within an area
2:10:40
that’s totally a National Forest now.
2:10:43
So, that’s where most of the impacts were identified as
2:10:48
things we had an effect over.
2:10:50
To the north, it was a mix of federal and private and to the east it was primarily
2:10:56
private land and so I think where your question came in was more as they were
2:11:03
negotiating what land exchanges would occur in order to create the monument
2:11:10
and have it be all national forest.
2:11:15
It was negotiations around what conditions you wanted the land to be in.
2:11:20
That was more of the Weyerhaeuser part.
2:11:23
In terms of the environmental analysis, they got on that pretty quickly.
2:11:29
The folks who, they actually within a year they had done their
2:11:35
first environmental analysis.
2:11:36
It covered quite a bit of area that’s on the east side of the current Monument.
2:11:42
Is that where we are, basically?
2:11:44
We’re on the east side right now.
2:11:46
Yeah.
2:11:46
The area that I was brought in to look at, I say I came on May 18 of
2:11:52
1981, which I always thought was sort of ironic, was an area they weren’t
2:11:56
sure whether it was going to be in the designated monument or not.
2:12:00
Because?
2:12:00
Any reason?
2:12:02
Because at the time there was a lot of negotiation going on
2:12:05
boundaries and options and the different options being looked at.
2:12:08
In some options it would not have been in the Monument, some options it was.
2:12:13
What they determined to do was be ready for just in case.
2:12:17
Because if you waited, when the possibility could happen that you needed
2:12:24
to move, but it was kind of not timely and so part of my job was actually
2:12:30
facilitating the environmental analysis and then figuring out where should we be
2:12:34
removing trees and where shouldn’t we.
2:12:37
In short, how would you say—explain that.
2:12:41
What the designations were, in terms of zones.
2:12:44
Just a general synopsis of that.
2:12:46
Of?
2:12:46
Of removing logs, where not to and where to.
2:12:50
A piece of that is often you’re looking at how steep is the area.
2:12:56
In the area I was looking at there were some really amazing riparian
2:13:00
areas with major waterways going through them and so you might be
2:13:07
looking at leaving material there.
2:13:09
There might be other areas where say there was just what felt like you threw
2:13:16
down pickup sticks and things were all kind of intermingled and as you look
2:13:22
at it and think about—and, again, in this case you’re not thinking about
2:13:27
natural processes, but you’re’ saying okay, if this is part of the national
2:13:30
forest, the objective would have been to remove some of that material so
2:13:35
that it could grow in differently.
2:13:37
There were some areas that were really steep, you know 120%+ slopes, and you kind
2:13:42
of go, “That’s an area you wouldn’t remove trees from,” you want to stabilize [it]
2:13:47
. Don’t touch, right.
2:13:47
You look at variety of those things.
2:13:51
Of course, after the eruption it was a slightly different situation, but you’re
2:13:55
often looking at what kind of habitat.
2:13:57
Is it an area where you’ve had nesting bald eagles?
2:14:01
Or is it an area with elk winter range?
2:14:05
If, for example, you might do different kinds of treatments in an elk winter
2:14:09
range than you would do in a forage area.
2:14:13
One of the things that we’re seeing today where we’ve had less what you would
2:14:18
call clearcut or regeneration harvest on national forest, and in many of the
2:14:23
western states there’s a concern about the impact on elk populations, because they
2:14:29
benefit from that open area and the forage and there isn’t that much of it anymore.
2:14:35
So, the side effect of that is that we have this really large herd of elk
2:14:39
on the west side of Mount St. Helens because you’ve got this huge forage area.
2:14:43
I saw a bunch of them this morning while leaving my camp.
2:14:45
Yeah.
2:14:46
In the debris avalanche lower area.
2:14:49
Right.
2:14:50
They were sprinting across the road, two huge bucks.
2:14:53
Oh wow.
2:14:54
They were big, man.
2:14:56
You know part of that is it’s a forage area.
2:14:59
Part of it is some of the seeding that was done and part of it is, when
2:15:03
you look around, there is not a lot of open area that’s providing that.
2:15:09
When we try to do environmental analysis and think from a wide suite of objectives
2:15:16
the way we’re looking at it today, you’re really thinking on a big planning scale.
2:15:21
Kind of how does this area fit in the landscape and what are the
2:15:24
functions and roles it’s playing?
2:15:26
Also, on National Forest, recognizing each landowner has different management
2:15:32
objectives, so how you’re going to manage an area might be different if
2:15:36
you’re a private landowner versus if you’re the Forest Service versus if
2:15:40
you are the Park Service, for example.
2:15:42
But you’re really saying where does this area fit within the area around
2:15:47
it, trying to think about the big picture objectives that you have and
2:15:53
then finding ways to balance that.
2:15:57
Anadromous fish, for example, is a big thing.
2:16:00
We have a lot of areas in the Pacific Northwest where one of our real goals is
2:16:05
to ensure we can have a [SS interrupts]
2:16:07
. Keep that connection to the sea.
2:16:08
Mm-hmm.
2:16:09
Yep.
2:16:09
Theoretically and otherwise.
2:16:11
Right.
2:16:12
We actually have places now where we’ve removed dams.
2:16:16
One on the Gifford Pinchot Forest here we removed a dam called the Hemlock Dam.
2:16:23
Where was that?
2:16:25
Down near the Wind River Experimental Forest.
2:16:27
Okay.
2:16:27
Down near there, and that was primarily around facilitating steelhead
2:16:34
coming up and within the day that we rewatered the stream, that afternoon
2:16:40
they saw a steelhead upriver.
2:16:43
It’s that kind of impact you’re having.
2:16:46
Now, the salvage logging on the Weyerhaeuser lands where they just took
2:16:51
everything, did that affect the watershed at all because they just stripped it?
2:16:57
It would be hard for me to make a statement about that.
2:17:00
I think Weyerhaeuser might identify that is that the watershed was
2:17:06
already so impacted by what had occurred that removing all of the
2:17:10
material would not have an additional effect and that they were going to
2:17:14
mitigate that by their replanting.
2:17:18
If you were to talk to somebody from Weyerhaeuser, they feel
2:17:20
very positive that they got that material removed and replanted and
2:17:24
a new stand growing very quickly.
2:17:28
Do you agree?
2:17:29
It would not be the way I would manage for the National Forest system.
2:17:34
That said, again each landowner has their own objectives and if
2:17:40
the way you want to look at something is landowner objectives,
2:17:46
I think they achieved what they did.
2:17:48
Now, if I look at it as a real function would be around having
2:17:53
more of the parts and pieces of the ecosystem that are naturally there,
2:17:58
I don’t think it achieved that.
2:18:02
How and when did the sciences become central to management planning
2:18:06
discussions at Mount St. Helens?
2:18:11
I know we talked about the -ologists in the ‘70s, but did that happen immediately
2:18:16
or was it like you just had managers and then you added scientists later?
2:18:21
I think that the way you just described it is probably [true] . It probably
2:18:26
provided an interesting opportunity in that while the mountain existed as this
2:18:34
kind of snow cone effect where people were coming and recreating, there was
2:18:38
probably general science going on.
2:18:40
This forest does have an experimental forest.
2:18:43
There was connection with scientists.
2:18:45
You’re talking about Wind River?
2:18:46
Yeah.
2:18:47
However, often between, although we’ve got this great research
2:18:52
branch, we have two things with research at that time that we did.
2:18:57
One was the basic research that occurred in the experimental forest
2:19:01
and another was where scientists might have interfaced with managers.
2:19:08
I didn’t work here early on.
2:19:12
It would be a supposition for me to say did they have a strong interface.
2:19:17
What I would guess did occur, though, is when the mountain started bulging
2:19:22
and such, obviously with USGS there became this very interfaced and then I
2:19:30
think you had people like Fred Swanson and Jerry Franklin and Jim Sedell
2:19:34
who saw the possibilities and they worked for Pacific Northwest Research
2:19:39
Station, and they were ready to come in.
2:19:44
My sense would be you know they had to work hard to be able to come in
2:19:48
quickly to be on that front door.
2:19:51
I think they were fairly early involved in the conversations.
2:19:57
Managers were in a learning phase about how do you do all that
2:20:00
interactive and there probably were a lot of tension points.
2:20:06
How and when did the prospect of a Volcanic National Monument emerge?
2:20:12
That was early on for you, but still you saw happen.
2:20:15
You became involved with it in some way later and throughout.
2:20:19
How did that happen?
2:20:20
Describe that process.
2:20:22
So, a great question again with the role that I had back in 1981,
2:20:27
I wouldn’t have been part of that.
2:20:28
Still, you observed it.
2:20:30
Yeah, what I observed was I was working out in the field.
2:20:36
There was a district ranger for what at the time was called
2:20:39
the St. Helens Ranger District.
2:20:41
He was involved working with the forest supervisor and others in the conversation.
2:20:47
There was certainly a number of people involved.
2:20:50
There were scientists.
2:20:51
There were community members.
2:20:53
There were legislators.
2:20:56
Similar to any kind of place,
2:21:00
there’s the dialogue that goes on about what should occur.
2:21:04
One of the conversations was around just make it a national park, for example.
2:21:10
There was a lot of dialogue about how big should it be?
2:21:14
What options?
2:21:15
What alternatives?
2:21:16
That piece was going on.
2:21:20
I was here in 1981 working on the Tradedollar area.
2:21:24
It was probably later,
2:21:28
probably about 3, 4 months after that I learned that, okay, it had
2:21:33
become part of the area that was going to be the Monument and so I
2:21:39
think the act passed May 26 of ’82.
2:21:42
It was one year after I had been here.
2:21:47
Over that two-year period, all the negotiations are occurring.
2:21:52
One thing I know that was really important to the Forest Service, is, especially
2:21:57
this idea of it being a national park, is demonstrating that, yes, we do have
2:22:03
the ability to manage places like this.
2:22:05
The community folks who were nearby wanted it to be a national forest because
2:22:10
of some concerns they had around the limitations that occur in national parks.
2:22:17
One of the things, at least for a while, that we really demonstrated was the
2:22:21
strength of our ability to do this.
2:22:24
We had world class interpreters.
2:22:27
We actually had people from the Park Service coming here
2:22:29
to learn from our people.
2:22:31
Really?
2:22:31
Yeah.
2:22:36
Who were the stakeholders in creating the Monument?
2:22:39
Just draw a sketch of that.
2:22:41
Ones that I would be aware of—obviously, the scientists who had an interest.
2:22:47
The State of Washington, various state agencies, the National
2:22:52
Forest Service community members.
2:22:55
I think there were national environmental groups who were involved because
2:22:58
this was one of those things that’s sort of precedent setting and so,
2:23:05
similar to many other places, you had both local and national interests.
2:23:10
Was the Sierra Club involved?
2:23:11
I believe so, yeah.
2:23:13
What’s some of the big, local organizations up here in Washington?
2:23:18
Then and today that may have changed.
2:23:20
Right, so then and I don’t know if it’s a group that was involved, probably
2:23:27
there’s other people that would be
2:23:31
more encompassing on this, but Audubon Society was a big group in this area.
2:23:38
Sierra Club, as you mentioned.
2:23:40
The Wilderness Society is actually a fairly robust, they go up and
2:23:46
down in terms of their presence, but at that general point in
2:23:51
time they were fairly active.
2:23:55
There is a group called the Gifford Pinchot Task Force that was actually
2:24:01
created in the ‘80s and their sole purpose was monitoring and influencing
2:24:07
what happened on the Gifford Pinchot Forest in terms of management in
2:24:12
large part because in the State of Washington there’s a lot of private land.
2:24:18
More than Oregon?
2:24:20
Yes.
2:24:20
There are more National Forest in Oregon percentagewise.
2:24:24
Here in the State of Washington you’ve got the Colville National Forest on the
2:24:29
far eastern side, the Okanogan-Wenatchee, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie, the
2:24:33
Olympic and the Gifford Pinchot.
2:24:36
What’s the one in the south, in the southeast?
2:24:40
The southeast you have a district off of the Umatilla.
2:24:43
That’s what I thought.
2:24:44
The Walla Walla Ranger District.
2:24:46
Right.
2:24:46
The Umatilla’s in Oregon, mostly.
2:24:47
Yeah.
2:24:48
Their forest headquarters is in Oregon and all the other districts.
2:24:51
One
2:24:54
of the concerns the Gifford Pinchot Task Force had is, if you look at, and they
2:24:59
were primarily focused on old growth, but if you look at the, again, a visual
2:25:07
of imagine you’re in a satellite looking down and you think about getting to the
2:25:12
ocean, the Columbia River, and then you look at the state lands which are managed
2:25:17
for the school trust fund and the private lands, the National Forests really are
2:25:22
that transition zone and so the Gifford Pinchot’s primary task has been monitoring
2:25:31
and engaging in this National Forest.
2:25:34
They get engaged a little bit with monument type things
2:25:37
but it’s not their key focus.
2:25:41
Right.
2:25:41
Obviously, one of the big groups now that’s a key thing and have tried to
2:25:46
involve over various iterations over the decades is the Mount St. Helens Institute,
2:25:52
and that’s sort of the idea of having a friends’ group that helps accomplish
2:25:57
some of the things that we want to do.
2:26:00
Is that a cooperative organization just with the Monument?
2:26:02
Yes.
2:26:03
Pretty much so.
2:26:04
The institute is their own organization.
2:26:06
They’re a non-profit and their focus is Mount St. Helens.
2:26:09
They are separate, but
2:26:14
they work integrally with the Forest Service.
2:26:15
They work integrally.
2:26:16
That’s what I meant, yeah.
2:26:16
Yeah.
2:26:17
They have one like that in Canyon Lands and most places where I’ve been.
2:26:20
This is about the fourth iteration.
2:26:22
There was something called the Mount St. Helens Educational Fund.
2:26:27
There’s been different varieties and one of the challenges has been they do great
2:26:31
work and it’s hard to raise the money.
2:26:35
And we don’t have the umbrella like the National Park Foundation
2:26:39
for them to operate under.
2:26:40
We do have a National Forest Foundation.
2:26:44
Their focus, they’ve identified focus areas, and this isn’t necessarily
2:26:51
one of them, and they’re a fledgling.
2:26:55
How
2:26:57
strongly did timber interests fight to minimize the size
2:27:00
of the volcanic monument?
2:27:02
And within the Monument minimize wilderness or scientific reserve areas?
2:27:07
Yeah, that’s a great question and I probably don’t know.
2:27:12
Should we go read your management plans?
2:27:14
Yeah, you can tell a bit about it in the management plan because
2:27:19
some of that’s reflected there.
2:27:23
I think the other piece with it is as you look at how the balance came out
2:27:30
amongst the alternatives that congress considered in designating the Monument,
2:27:35
you can kind of see the reflection there of trying to find that balance between
2:27:43
where should be those areas of ecological processes versus removing things.
2:27:54
Again, in a time of evolution it was just 1976 when the National Forest
2:28:00
Management Act had been passed, and actually the forest plans for this part
2:28:06
of the country had not occurred yet.
2:28:08
I was on the Flathead Forest and our plan came out in 1983.
2:28:14
The plans here actually came out in around 1990, ‘91 and ’92.
2:28:18
Now the wind
2:28:23
stops.
2:28:25
Okay, we’re on the record again.
2:28:30
You were just saying—sorry, I had to turn it off for a minute.
2:28:33
What was I saying?
2:28:38
Oh, about the forest plans.
2:28:40
Right.
2:28:40
In this part of the country the first iteration of the land and
2:28:45
resource management plans were coming out in 1990, ’91 and ’92.
2:28:50
At the time when the volcano had erupted and we’re going through this
2:28:53
process much of that work had not been done here in the Pacific Northwest.
2:28:59
Before we had Land and Resource Management Plans under the National
2:29:03
Forest Management Act what many areas did was have what were called Unit Plans.
2:29:08
Now is this the 60 Act or the 76 Act?
2:29:11
The ‘76 Act is the National Forest Management Act.
2:29:15
Before we had that, we just had to do a forest plan.
2:29:19
One of the ways that we managed was we would have unit plans for different
2:29:24
sections of the forest and so those are the kinds of things that would help
2:29:28
guide what was the purposes and what not.
2:29:31
Obviously with the volcano erupting, it provided a different option for this area.
2:29:39
What kind of interfaces are there with the Monument with BLM lands?
2:29:44
None.
2:29:45
None.
2:29:46
There’s no BLM lands here.
2:29:47
Okay.
2:29:47
I just saw this in here.
2:29:48
I just wanted to know.
2:29:51
There is one BLM district in the State of Washington.
2:29:54
They’re actually managed out of Spokane and they manage lands from
2:29:59
the east side of the state all the way out to the Whidbey Island.
2:30:03
On your shirt there’s a big bug.
2:30:05
Oh, thank you.
2:30:05
I didn’t know if it was—
2:30:07
Yeah.
2:30:09
Now what you did have here was a number of mining claims.
2:30:13
Mining claims are generally—they become a private inholding.
2:30:18
There was quite a bit after the monument was designated there was
2:30:23
quite a bit of work done to reacquire those claims because there’s different
2:30:31
things that go with the land but, if somebody’s established a legitimate
2:30:36
claim, the National Forest might be managing the surface lands, but
2:30:39
the miner has the rights to the—
2:30:41
Exactly.
2:30:42
The same was true with parks.
2:30:44
Yep.
2:30:45
Did you have a lot here?
2:30:47
There was quite a bit up around the Spirit Lake area.
2:30:51
This is an area that, I don’t know how many.
2:30:56
Again, that’s one of the things, if I did know, I’ve forgotten.
2:30:59
But there’s a number of them around.
2:31:04
One way that you’d know that is of course the miner’s car down there [a
2:31:07
display near Meta Lake] , but also—
2:31:09
Was it gold?
2:31:10
Yes, they were looking for gold.
2:31:12
There’s other areas.
2:31:14
Gold is one of the things.
2:31:17
There’s other minerals that mining companies have looked at.
2:31:23
We do actually have farther to the west there’s actually
2:31:27
something called Miners Creek.
2:31:30
There were areas all up and down there.
2:31:32
There were a number of claims around Spirit Lake.
2:31:36
Are those mostly bought out now?
2:31:39
Retired?
2:31:40
I think that they’ve gotten to 100%.
2:31:42
Okay, good.
2:31:47
How would you characterize how interpretation developed here?
2:31:52
You’ve got the scientific reserve idea.
2:31:54
You’ve got preservation.
2:31:56
You’ve got different things.
2:31:59
Of course, it’s a unique animal in the system because
2:32:02
of St. Helens is St. Helens.
2:32:04
Right.
2:32:06
One piece with it, we’ve probably always had storytelling and Spirit
2:32:11
Lake and the areas around it were really special to people way back when.
2:32:17
You had the Girl Scout camp.
2:32:19
You had different camps going on here.
2:32:22
It was a place that people came and whenever people are coming to
2:32:25
recreate you have storytelling.
2:32:28
It depends on how you want to label interpretation.
2:32:30
One of the purposes of the enabling legislation for the Monument was
2:32:37
interpretation and education, so it was built in and it was an
2:32:41
expectation that it would be included.
2:32:44
I think as the management plan was developed and then implemented, the
2:32:51
Monument and the forest brought in people who had great expertise in trying to
2:32:56
do that and storytelling on a variety of fronts, some as a cultural story.
2:33:02
What was the people’s story who were here?
2:33:05
Then another part as you start telling both the geology and the biology of
2:33:12
this place and one of the really key elements is the interface between
2:33:18
the information developed by the scientists and translating that into
2:33:26
little modules of information that can be conveyed to people and helping them
2:33:34
to be able to take information as it’s developing in real
2:33:39
time and share that with folks.
2:33:42
The interpretation that you see here at the Monument is done in a variety
2:33:46
of ways: some of it’s through movies.
2:33:48
Some of it’s through displays.
2:33:51
A lot of it’s interfaced with USGS information.
2:33:56
USGS CVO [Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, WA]
2:33:57
actually has, or at one time, had a scientist stationed out of Johnston
2:34:02
Ridge Observatory and they helped.
2:34:05
Then people like Charlie Crisafulli are helping provide information that is
2:34:13
going into the messaging and the folks here have a really great training
2:34:19
program that they do, actually for their spring training as they get
2:34:24
ready it takes about three weeks.
2:34:26
Not all of that is training people to be interpreters.
2:34:28
Some of it’s defensive driving and things, but they actually use the
2:34:34
principles of interpretation, the National Association of Interpreters and Todd
2:34:40
Cullings, we have probably one of the best interpreters in the entire country.
2:34:45
He helps train everybody here
2:34:48
and we bring in folks and they’re getting the story.
2:34:53
They get time to work on their programs.
2:34:55
Part of what they’re encouraged to do is to think about what is a story that
2:34:59
connects for them, because often that’s the best story that you could tell.
2:35:04
Then how did they take their principles of that and translate it into a story?
2:35:12
They do it in multiple ways.
2:35:13
One is actually in a spot, so on the plaza at Johnston Ridge or at Windy Ridge where
2:35:20
people are sitting there listening to you.
2:35:22
Another is this idea of roving interpretation, where you’re out wandering
2:35:26
around and you come across people.
2:35:28
And you go to Windy Ridge or what have you.
2:35:29
Right and just through the question people ask.
2:35:33
You can take that question and can work with how am I going to tell this
2:35:36
story here in a way that connects with what they are here to hear about and
2:35:40
yet we give some real core messages.
2:35:43
How do you deal with the Creationists here?
2:35:47
I mean remember the Grand Canyon thing where they put the alternative view
2:35:50
of creation which I thought was very questionable by the Park Service.
2:35:57
What do you deal with that because I know there are some active organizations here?
2:36:00
I saw them one day.
2:36:02
There is an active organization here [SS talks over LB]
2:36:03
. That goes against with the general tenor of post-enlightenment natural history,
2:36:08
evolution of history and natural history.
2:36:10
That’s kind of the general schemata that most people who work with the Park
2:36:15
Service, the Forest Service, interpreters in that agency general espouse to.
2:36:21
How do you deal with that understanding that these are also citizens of
2:36:25
this country who are paying taxes, etc., and this is their land also?
2:36:30
Right.
2:36:31
It’s a great question.
2:36:33
I can’t speak for the current Monument manager.
2:36:35
I’ll just share some of my observations.
2:36:38
One is that there’s actually a museum down along the visitor center corridor
2:36:43
that is dedicated to telling that story, and so they have their own museum there.
2:36:49
There is a geologist who’s involved with that perspective and believes
2:36:55
that the story of Mount St. Helens and the way the eruption occurred,
2:36:59
and the different parts and pieces is a classic example that proves
2:37:05
that the world was created in 7 days.
2:37:09
That individual on a couple of occasions filed applications to do research.
2:37:16
You don’t just get to come do research.
2:37:18
You actually have to do it through a particular process or apply
2:37:21
for say a special use permit.
2:37:24
They have on occasion submitted applications asking to be allowed
2:37:29
to enter the more restricted zone.
2:37:32
There’s an application process that the Monument uses to evaluate that.
2:37:38
At this point, the things that they propose to do have not met that criteria.
2:37:43
In terms of people coming and engaging at the place, they would be treated
2:37:50
similar to say anybody else wanting to come and say tell their story to
2:37:55
people or set up booths or anything.
2:37:57
You actually have to have a permit to do that.
2:38:00
You have to go through that process.
2:38:02
There’s very little of that approved here in the monument,
2:38:07
in large part because it’s not what the objective is but we are
2:38:12
guided by free speech issues.
2:38:15
There’s a whole number of things in the question that you asked about.
2:38:23
The things our Forest Leadership Team did when I was here, we used
2:38:27
to do an activity called Camporama.
2:38:30
The leadership team would spend 3 days on a section of the forest
2:38:34
really talking about strategic issues and different things.
2:38:37
On year we spent on the west side of the Monument and some other locations and we
2:38:43
actually visited the museum where they put forward the idea of Mount St. Helens
2:38:49
and Creationism just to expose ourselves to there’s a lot of different viewpoints.
2:38:54
Right.
2:38:55
We sat through their perspective and much of it’s a bookstore with materials
2:39:04
that they believe support that viewpoint.
2:39:07
But they also have a display where they show different pieces.
2:39:11
As you would listen to the scientists tell the story of the surge and of all
2:39:15
the things going down the river, they use those same bits and stories to say
2:39:21
this is an example of how this occurred, and this occurred, and this occurred.
2:39:26
One of the things as a manager, not as a scientist, but as a manager, that
2:39:32
it helps remind me about is how do I be open to hearing lots of different
2:39:39
perspectives, because oftentimes some of those unpopular perspectives turn out
2:39:45
later to be new information that we have.
2:39:49
So, for example, things that we’re taking from Mt. St. Helens with the
2:39:53
idea of leaving legacies and leaving green trees and leaving snags and down
2:39:57
woody material, when we built those into other parts of the management
2:40:03
of the northwest, there were a lot of people who didn’t agree with that.
2:40:06
They didn’t think that was a good way to do it and yet it’s now become part
2:40:11
of our knowledge and understanding.
2:40:14
So one thing that’s really important as a manager is how do you stay not
2:40:19
necessarily affected by all these things, but open to information.
2:40:23
That was one of the things we tried to do was rather than just deciding that’s
2:40:28
wrong, was, “Okay let’s experience it,” because they consider themselves
2:40:33
to have a visitor center and here, we have all these visitor centers and we
2:40:38
didn’t necessarily see them that way.
2:40:40
It was a good exposure for us.
2:40:43
We had some very interesting philosophical talks that evening around the campfire.
2:40:48
I think so.
2:40:51
Now you kind of mentioned it quickly there: how has what has happened
2:40:55
here at St. Helens in terms of the science reflected back into management
2:41:01
policies region wise, even further, but we can stick with this area.
2:41:07
I think you know one of the ways that I would look at it is in terms
2:41:12
of the Douglas-fir region, which is primarily western Washington, western
2:41:17
Oregon, it’s had a major impact in terms of understanding how these
2:41:25
systems work and understanding the dynamics of what’s going on here.
2:41:30
We’ve learned a tremendous amount about biological legacies.
2:41:35
It helped informed the idea of what you leave is as important as what you take.
2:41:39
A lot of times when we’re doing management and it was looking at, well, what are the
2:41:44
areas where you could remove trees from?
2:41:47
It helped us not just think of how many trees are you removing and
2:41:52
where it is on the patchwork, but it also helped convey this importance
2:41:58
of this material left behind.
2:42:00
Again, that’s standing live, standing dead, and down woody material.
2:42:06
That got incorporated into some forest plans even before the idea
2:42:11
of the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:42:13
Another way it started affecting things was this idea of riparian areas and
2:42:20
how important the dynamics of that area are, so you’re already seeing some
2:42:27
of that information get translated.
2:42:29
It’s one of the beauties here and one of the things that I love not only here,
2:42:33
but at the H.J. Andrews is you know many times, if you wait for information to
2:42:39
get translated in a scientific paper, you could be waiting for decades.
2:42:44
Decades is probably not correct, but you’re collecting data for a
2:42:47
long time and then it might take a number of years to get it in.
2:42:51
The beauty of the connection here and say at the Andrews is that we took a lot of
2:42:59
what we were learning which is both basic and applied research kinds of concepts
2:43:05
and starting applying them immediately, and maybe before the papers were written,
2:43:10
maybe before the ah-ha’s were there.
2:43:13
It doesn’t mean you got it all right, but you were probably at the 80%
2:43:18
level, and you could incorporate them.
2:43:19
The ideas had enough substance and validity based on what you
2:43:25
were seeing happening that there was a legitimate reason to apply
2:43:29
or try to apply all elements of various ideas and analysis, right?
2:43:35
Correct, and so one of the things you might think about is, prior to
2:43:40
incorporating some of the ideas in the Douglas-fir region, you often would
2:43:46
have a fairly standard prescription you might use for, again, this is where
2:43:50
you’re removing vegetation to provide wood products for society, and it was
2:43:54
probably that you would clear cut, remove a lot of the material, pile it,
2:43:58
burn what was left over, and then you’d come in and plant new Douglas-fir on an
2:44:03
8x8 [foot] spacing, which meant you had way more trees than you needed and you
2:44:07
were going to go in and pre-commercially thin, so you got the best.
2:44:11
That was a pretty standard prescription and we evolved to a much more complicated
2:44:17
place where we were, and generally it would be say 20 to 60 acres in size
2:44:24
and create edge for elk, and such, so we became more complicated in the
2:44:30
idea of leaving more features behind.
2:44:34
One of the things that we saw when we would do trips down at Blue River
2:44:40
when I worked there, we would take people out is some people called
2:44:44
it a term they might use is “dirty forestry,” whether you agree with it or
2:44:52
not, not knowing what you’re seeing, a lot of times if you look at a
2:44:56
clearcut and as it starts growing in it looks clean, so to speak.
2:45:02
Now what they were seeing was places with big trees laying down
2:45:07
and with snags left and maybe the
2:45:12
new young trees having started growing in and they’re looking
2:45:17
at it and it looks messy.
2:45:19
You could call it messy or dirty.
2:45:22
One thing we learned through some of the studies we did down there with
2:45:25
people who looked at people’s reactions was that a lot of times people’s
2:45:33
understanding of what they were seeing,
2:45:38
whether they liked it or didn’t like it, could be affected by their
2:45:41
perception of whether it was messy.
2:45:45
So, we actually did some studies where we would try and say okay give us
2:45:50
your impression beforehand and then we would do a little education about
2:45:53
what they were seeing and then gives us your impression and see if there
2:45:56
was a shift as they got educated.
2:45:58
So,
2:46:01
pretty much throughout the Northwest now, I think, you would see with the
2:46:06
biological legacies as well embedded.
2:46:10
Again, that didn’t wait for being proven.
2:46:14
One of the ways we talked about it at the Andrews, because we looked at it both with
2:46:17
this part as well as what is the landscape level management look like, and we would
2:46:24
talk about it on some of the engagements that we have with people is we can’t
2:46:29
wait for it to be proven to try it out.
2:46:34
I think a lot of what we learned here at St. Helens got incorporated in that way.
2:46:39
You mentioned the Andrews pretty briefly.
2:46:43
I kind of would like you to address how the Andrews, how you see the
2:46:48
Andrews and the LTER eclectic ecosystem science dynamic work that came out of
2:46:53
that place, how you think it affected this place and how you see this place
2:46:59
came back and affected what they did leading into when you actually became
2:47:06
District Ranger right down at Blue River, correct?
2:47:09
I mean, you worked with them intimately for years.
2:47:14
I think a piece of it it’s sort of that interesting thing in time is that
2:47:21
in those early decades the Andrews became what was called the IBP, one of the IBP
2:47:28
sites, which was something that Jerry Franklin helped get set up with this idea
2:47:33
of the International Biosphere Program.
2:47:34
Biological Program.
2:47:34
Yeah, Biological Program.
2:47:35
Then
2:47:39
it eventually led to this concept of long-term ecological research, which
2:47:43
is more about integrated research.
2:47:46
Right.
2:47:46
And that notion of finding a way to bring different people together.
2:47:51
One of the ways I think these two places are interrelated is you
2:47:55
had people committed to place.
2:47:57
You got somebody like Fred Swanson who’s a geologist; somebody like Jerry
2:48:02
Franklin, who is a forester type; Jim Sedell and Gordie Reeves who are
2:48:07
aquatics people and they were all working together out of Corvallis connected to
2:48:15
this idea of these places and some of them had more connection than others.
2:48:20
So, Jerry grew up in the Camas area you know, so this was a special place
2:48:24
to him, and yet [SS interrupts LB]
2:48:26
. It’s his home turf.
2:48:26
It’s his home turf.
2:48:27
He has a cabin in Wind River.
2:48:28
He still has a cabin in the Government Mineral Springs area, and
2:48:35
he’s dedicated to the Wind River Experimental Forest and he had
2:48:40
ideas and visions of how can we help make these experimental forests be
2:48:44
more in terms of what they produce.
2:48:46
You had that interesting core network of people and they were
2:48:51
used to working together in an integrated fashion and then I think
2:48:59
they’ve been evolving that for a long time so that when the mountain
2:49:03
erupted it was early in that process.
2:49:06
I think coming here and into this setting actually threw them together
2:49:12
in that idea of integrated and maybe in some ways helped evolve
2:49:18
the way they thought about it.
2:49:19
That’s just my observation from outside and in the LTER network concept, where
2:49:29
there’s a little bit of funding that helps create that reward for doing
2:49:33
integrated work, one of the beauties there was having a place and a very active
2:49:42
National Forest where the juxtaposition of time and place and who was there
2:49:48
and so you had this set of folks.
2:49:52
Jerry was the lead with the LTER group.
2:49:55
You had managers at the forest who were interested in changing and learning.
2:50:00
It was one of the magic moments in time where everybody came together, and so I
2:50:07
think partly it’s two different places that are really special to a set of people
2:50:14
and then each of those constellations.
2:50:16
So, you have a core set of people and then at each of the locations
2:50:21
they have a different constellation of people that are around them, but
2:50:26
that core group keeps the linkage and the dialogue going back and forth.
2:50:31
Then, the other piece I think that I’ve seen is that you have people
2:50:35
who are passionate about place.
2:50:37
Like Charlie
2:50:40
Crisafulli.
2:50:40
He’s been here since the beginning and it’s his passion and it’s
2:50:45
his life in terms of his work.
2:50:49
Between having that one set of people who were core and then having these
2:50:54
other folks and having the idea of things like pulses, which St. Helens wasn’t
2:51:02
the only place they’ve done pulses, some down in California in different places,
2:51:06
but having that idea brings scientists together I think has evolved thinking.
2:51:12
The pulse, the strength of the pulse, and the continuation of the pulse
2:51:16
over time on a consistent basis is much stronger here than the ones
2:51:21
they started down in California.
2:51:23
Yes.
2:51:23
Which don’t continue anymore.
2:51:24
Right.
2:51:25
They did Sequoia [Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park] , basically,
2:51:27
and I think they did two of them, maybe, or three, maybe?
2:51:29
Yes, I think that’s about right.
2:51:31
I think that’s one of the challenges with any long-term research is
2:51:35
how do you keep people interested?
2:51:38
It’s one of the beauties I think they’re working on here; is how do you really
2:51:42
hand it off to the next generation?
2:51:44
And what’s going to get them interested in being here because they’re
2:51:48
coming in at a different trajectory.
2:51:51
The original folks here are what made it interesting here, different than say
2:51:56
Sequoia, is you’re seeing the real change.
2:52:00
You came in at an amazing event.
2:52:03
Some of the awe factor has been mitigated.
2:52:06
Right.
2:52:06
It’s still fabulous, but it’s not oh, my God!
2:52:10
Stunning, blow your mind away.
2:52:13
Well, the first few years when there was still mostly—
2:52:17
Even the first 20 years.
2:52:18
Now the challenge is, too, the new people coming in now only is the
2:52:24
awe factor mitigated some, but they never experienced the real humph.
2:52:31
What will motivate them?
2:52:32
What will keep them here?
2:52:35
I’ll tell you I think over the years it’s taken dedicated people.
2:52:39
It was really exciting to hear that Rob Mangold [PNW Station
2:52:41
Director] has supported this.
2:52:43
There were timea with certain station directors with Mount St. Helens and its
2:52:48
work wasn’t necessarily the Station’s priority and there’s at least one of
2:52:53
the pulses, Jim Sedell when he was station director at Pacific Southwest
2:52:57
Research Station down in California actually underwrote the pulse because
2:53:03
one, he was committed to it and, two, it’s part of his heart place.
2:53:08
So, just like any transitions, trying to think about how you do handoffs and how
2:53:14
you really keep long-term work going.
2:53:18
It will be fun to see Mark Harman’s log decompositions studies designed
2:53:22
to go 200 years, and see, okay, what really happens when Mark retires?
2:53:27
Right.
2:53:28
So, how would you characterize the aesthetic of Mount St.
2:53:31
Helens, pre- and post-eruption?
2:53:35
What is beautiful?
2:53:36
And why do people have different concepts of beauty for this place?
2:53:43
That’s a really great question.
2:53:46
So,
2:53:49
my sense, starting with the last question, why people have different
2:53:53
concepts of beauty is, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say.
2:53:59
I think often one of the pieces I believe, our role as public land
2:54:05
managers is to help provide opportunities for people to make memories.
2:54:10
I think much of how we form our concept of beauty comes from our childhood,
2:54:16
from the values that we experience from the experiences that we have and
2:54:22
so from that is where a lot of the different senses of beauty come from.
2:54:27
Many people who were here prior to the 1980 eruption who had spent
2:54:35
time on the lake, who had been on the mountain, who had sat down in
2:54:38
Portland and looked at the mountain.
2:54:44
Had grown used to the Fuji-esque look.
2:54:45
That was their context for things.
2:54:49
For some I think that was ripped away and I’ve talked to people who
2:54:57
feel like the mountain betrayed them.
2:55:00
They anthropomorphized the mountain, like that it did this
2:55:05
to me, like it took this away.
2:55:07
How could it ever do that?
2:55:09
It’s an interesting piece about how our psychology works, about
2:55:13
how we connect with place.
2:55:15
The beauty of that is they were so connected to place, which
2:55:19
is really a neat thing because place is embedded in our souls.
2:55:23
Exactly.
2:55:26
For me, not having visited prior to the eruption, I don’t have that context
2:55:33
other than pictures of the place, or if I had ever visited, I don’t remember it.
2:55:41
For me, part of the beauty of this place is the evolution part, being here in
2:55:48
the middle of the blast zone, standing out there and feeling the power of
2:55:52
nature, and that’s a word that even today you know 30 some years later,
2:56:01
what I remember is power, a feeling of power and awe to be standing out in
2:56:07
this place and know, one, that it had happened and, two, that it could do it
2:56:14
again any minute and I could be dead.
2:56:17
It changed me in a bit, and I love the way in which the mountain is evolving.
2:56:27
One of my favorite moments is actually in 2000 I got an opportunity to walk up
2:56:32
into the crater and sit at the base of the dome and it was an ah-ha moment for me
2:56:37
because sitting there eating lunch, being exhausted and wondering if I’d ever make
2:56:41
it out, but it was listening to it and it was like listening in a bowling alley.
2:56:47
There were all these boulders rolling down the side and it was noisy.
2:56:51
Because the dome constantly is slowly growing.
2:56:54
Well, and it wasn’t just the dome, they were rolling down the sides of
2:56:58
the peak and my ah-ha was until I sat there, I had never had a context
2:57:03
that there would be that noise there.
2:57:06
It was one of those ah-ha’s about being open to experiences and place because
2:57:14
I kind of doing as a duh thing and hit your forehead.
2:57:18
Once I experienced it, it’s like duh.
2:57:20
Well, of course.
2:57:21
This is a geological event going on.
2:57:23
Of course, it’s noisy.
2:57:24
Of course, rocks are rolling down.
2:57:27
Yet, it had never occurred to me.
2:57:29
That’s for me one of the beauties of the place is that.
2:57:34
Another beauty for me is seeing the joy on people’s faces when they get their
2:57:42
ah-ha moments and knowing that the experience they’re having here is maybe
2:57:48
creating new little scientists for the future, maybe creating senses of wonder
2:57:54
that people will take back with them.
2:57:57
One of the not-joyous parts is when you see somebody who’s sort of
2:58:01
like, well, is that all there is.
2:58:04
It’s kind of like, oh my gosh.
2:58:07
That’s a piece, it’s both the evolution of the place biologically and physically
2:58:16
and then the interconnection of people with place for me that creates the beauty.
2:58:22
A memory I have from 2000, when we were having the 20th
2:58:25
anniversary, which was a big to-do.
2:58:27
Twenty years is sort of a big moment.
2:58:30
Forty will probably be.
2:58:31
Forty might be.
2:58:32
Fifty, for sure, will be.
2:58:34
But I remember being out here on Road 99 on the way to Windy Ridge and I had
2:58:40
my uniform on and I would listen to people talk, and they would tell you
2:58:45
their stories about it and the ah-ha moment was listening to somebody come up
2:58:51
and go oh my gosh it’s changed so much.
2:58:54
I believe how much has grown in.
2:58:56
And then the next person would come up and say it’s so devastated.
2:59:00
I can’t believe how nothing is happening.
2:59:04
One of my experiences was these were people who had seen the area before, been
2:59:09
here early, right after they opened the road, was that piece about how everybody
2:59:16
experiences a place differently and to have that juxtaposition of moments.
2:59:22
I had another one of those on the Andrews once where we were doing a field
2:59:26
tour and Stub Stewart [forest products business leader] , who was a big donor
2:59:30
to OSU Foundation, was on that and one of the pieces, of course, was about
2:59:36
timber industry and we were talking about the importance of biological legacy.
2:59:40
He was getting really upset and he pointed his finger down at
2:59:47
piece that was laying down and he went that’s a Cadillac there.
2:59:51
He actually turned around and said to me, “There will be Nuremberg-like
2:59:56
trials someday and you will be found guilty.” Art McKee, who was the manager
3:00:01
of the Andrews Forest [SS interrupts LB]
3:00:03
. Of what?
3:00:04
Of not providing economic value, you know, that these were things
3:00:10
that we were leaving behind, and he could not get around his mind why
3:00:13
it was okay to leave this piece of material that might be worth $8,000.
3:00:19
It just didn’t make sense to him.
3:00:21
He couldn’t understand it.
3:00:22
So, Art took him off to talk to him about it, because he’s a big donor
3:00:25
to OSU and it was very important.
3:00:28
He had that experience.
3:00:29
Meanwhile, Stan Gregory, who’s a fisheries person with OSU, was walking
3:00:35
up from a riparian area where he had taken some folks from the National Parks
3:00:38
Service and had been talking with them and they were like this is horrible.
3:00:42
I can’t believe this is actually good management, and, so, it was that
3:00:47
juxtaposition in the same moment in time of people seeing the same things and
3:00:53
not liking for very different reasons.
3:00:58
Those are two points in times that I will always remember, because they
3:01:03
helped me keep context about there aren’t right answers out here and
3:01:09
remember that, and for all that we’re learning, we will always learn more.
3:01:15
If we ever think we have the right answer, we’re probably kidding ourselves,
3:01:20
because it’s a matter of continuing to observe and learn and modify.
3:01:27
That is a perfect final answer.
