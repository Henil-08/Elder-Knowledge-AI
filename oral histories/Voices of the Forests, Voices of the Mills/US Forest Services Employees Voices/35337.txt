00:03
This is Dr. Samuel Schmeiding, Oregon State University College of Forestry.
00:07
I am here in Chelatchie Prairie, Washington, with Charlie
00:15
Crisafulli, Research Ecologist for the US Forest Service Pacific
00:21
Northwest Research Station.
00:24
He’s the Research Ecologist for the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.
00:30
Yes.
00:31
I think I got that wrong.
00:32
But anyway, and we are basically—
00:34
More or less.
00:35
Off to the side of the headquarters and we are going to do an oral history
00:39
interview here today, probably in two parts and this is a part of a greater
00:44
history project on the science of Mount St. Helens and other related subjects.
00:50
I want to thank you, Charlie, for taking the time to meet with us today.
00:54
And how are you today?
00:55
My pleasure, Sam.
00:56
I’m pleased to be here.
00:57
I’m doing wonderful, thanks.
00:58
Alright, very good.
01:00
Okay, well we usually like to start these—these are longer interviews.
01:04
They are oral history, so they incorporate personal biography and things like
01:10
that, so I will ask you the basic question: where were you born and raised?
01:14
I was born in Albany, New York.
01:17
I was raised there through the age of 20.
01:22
Where is Albany?
01:23
Albany is in the Hudson Valley about 120 miles north of New York City.
01:32
I knew that, but—anyway, what was your childhood like, especially
01:37
in relation to the natural world?
01:40
Well, I grew up on about 150 acres in the Hudson Valley, which is nestled
01:46
between Berkshire Mountains to the east, the Helderberg Escarpment to the west,
01:51
the Catskill Mountains to the south, and the Adirondack Mountains to the north.
01:55
So, it was a rural setting, but only perhaps 10 miles south of Albany,
01:59
and on this 150 acres, which was pastoral farmland mixed with hedge
02:06
rows, rock walls, and the typical rock walls that you find anywhere
02:10
you went in New York, and deciduous forest: oak, maple, hickory primarily.
02:17
On the 150 acres we had two ponds.
02:19
We had a couple of streams and so it afforded me great opportunities to the
02:25
outdoors and I spent many of my waking hours out romping around throughout
02:31
the seasons, everything from riding bicycles and fishing in the streams
02:36
and ponds to collecting frogs and salamanders and snakes and turtles
02:41
to ice building lean-tos and having bonfires and ice skating throughout
02:45
the winter and playing pond hockey.
02:48
So, would you say that it was more just a kid having fun in the outdoors
02:54
or was there a scientific bent to what you were doing, even at that early age?
02:59
Yeah, I think there was something to it.
03:00
I had a natural curiosity that seemed insatiable from the earliest of days.
03:06
Fortunately, because of where my parents settled, and my dad built
03:10
the house and we lived in this countryside setting that it afforded
03:16
me the opportunity to engage with it.
03:18
In addition to that may family had property up in the Adirondack Mountains
03:22
where my father and my brothers and I cleared the land and built a cabin
03:27
and so right on a lake, at Schroon Lake, in the heart of the Adirondacks.
03:31
Spent a lot of time up there and then my best buddies in middle school and
03:35
high school had a place out east on Long Island and so we had access to the ocean.
03:41
Much of my life would be characterized by the outdoor world where I was
03:47
able to pursue my interests, although they were untrained then and I had no
03:53
anticipation of where it might lead me.
03:56
One thing for sure is I had great zeal and took advantage of the opportunities
04:02
I had by spending so much time outdoors.
04:05
I had the fondest of memories of just being out one spring when the frogs
04:10
arrived and ice out to the ponds and just listening to the chorus and going out at
04:15
night and just sitting down and listening to the frogs for 10s of minutes at a time.
04:20
I remember going back when the tadpoles, the eggs would hatch and
04:24
tadpoles were there and seeing this enormous bird flying right out from
04:27
the pond, feet from me, startled me.
04:29
It was the size of me and come to find out it was a Great Blue
04:34
Herron, first one I had ever seen.
04:36
To this day I have vivid memories.
04:38
Also, a little bit older, going frigid cold temperatures into the heart of
04:43
the Adirondacks white cedar bogs, 20 below zero with my old rawhide
04:50
and hickory snowshoes and walking through those marshes bitter cold.
04:54
With every inhalation your nostrils sticking together and just remember
04:58
the calm and the stillness of that environment and to this day it stirs
05:03
my curiosity and brings me peace.
05:07
Where you considered an odd bird by your high school mates?
05:11
I think so.
05:12
In some regard.
05:13
I didn’t do sports and so I wasn’t interested in that.
05:17
Although, what some of that youthful curiosity turned to is a more consumptive
05:23
sort of an engagement with nature.
05:26
What I mean by that is lots and lots of hunting and fishing trips.
05:30
My buddies engaged in that.
05:32
Through high school it seemed like almost every weekend that would be
05:36
within some season, which meant most of the year, we were off fishing
05:39
for brook trout, or for pike, or for walleye, or for bass, brook trout.
05:45
Or we were off hunting white tails or grouse.
05:49
That
05:51
became a huge part of my high school trips and of course we did it
05:59
you know as youth would with lots of, I would say some reckless
06:03
engagement and carrying on and shenanigans, but it was a blast.
06:09
All of those steps I think in my formative years led me to where I was today,
06:16
although I had no idea I was on that path, but it was clear in retrospect.
06:22
Wow.
06:24
I take it that your parents were very encouraging to your interest in nature,
06:28
or was that just beyond their influence, your hanging out with your friends?
06:32
Or did they encourage that part of your life?
06:34
This is how that goes: my parents I came from a blue collar, Catholic, Italian
06:44
family, and my parents knew how to work, and they worked hard, and they thought
06:52
that was the thing to do, was to work.
06:56
Family business, construction business, and so my grandfather started it.
06:59
My uncles and my dad worked there.
07:02
Some of my siblings worked there.
07:04
Some are there still today running the business.
07:07
They didn’t really know the whole nature thing.
07:10
We weren’t a family that grew up camping, although we did have our camp
07:13
and we went on a few camping trips.
07:16
My grandfather hunted and my father and his brothers and
07:19
my cousins and my brothers.
07:21
That was part of it.
07:22
But they saw my interests and they certainly encouraged it.
07:28
There was no discouragement of that whatsoever.
07:31
There was nothing that said why are you doing this?
07:34
Instead, they saw all of the interests I had and they
07:39
certainly you know condoned that.
07:46
How would you describe the aesthetic of upstate New York?
07:51
I’m talking about the natural aesthetic: mountains, plains, farms.
07:54
If you were going to describe that conglomerate wise or individually,
07:58
how would you describe that?
07:59
Well, my view of that has changed.
08:00
When I left there, because I had a taste of the west, in particular
08:05
all of Canada, every providence from Quebec to British Columbia once
08:10
I had graduated from high school.
08:12
Then I had made some other trips out west.
08:16
I didn’t think too much of New York and New England.
08:19
With time, as I’ve gone back, which I do every year by the way, I realized
08:23
just how great that part of the country is for its natural values.
08:30
I was just back in August and I took my two nephews up on to a hike
08:35
to Pharaoh Mountain and looking out over the lakes and ridge after
08:40
ridge after ridge [SS interrupts]
08:40
. The Finger Lakes?
08:41
No, this is the Adirondacks, the High Lakes region.
08:43
Oh, it’s the High Lakes, right.
08:44
Yeah and just looking out over the ridges into the high peaks area up
08:48
by Lake Placid and [SS interrupts]
08:51
. Mount Marcy, isn’t Mount Marcy [CC talks over SS]
08:52
. Yeah, exactly.
08:53
Yeah, in any case it’s beautiful and I think the Helderbergs,
08:58
the Berkshires, the Catskills, and what’s great is the history’s so rich there.
09:03
There’s stories—this is a place that Teddy Roosevelt spent a lot of time,
09:07
Gifford Pinchot spent a lot of time.
09:09
It’s a place that the Eisenhowers and the Rockefellers, even our political
09:14
world is tied up in there and these were people who really enjoyed the
09:18
environment and it’s great reading about that now, their level of engagement.
09:24
In any case, New York cared, the politicians cared, and they made a
09:27
6-million-acre park, the Adirondack Park.
09:32
Preserve, yeah.
09:32
Exactly.
09:33
Which was really a predecessor and a model for what would happen later in various
09:39
areas, and an exception in the east too.
09:43
Exactly.
09:44
It was to be forever wild.
09:46
Yeah.
09:48
That was the motto.
09:51
In any case, it’s a wonderful place.
09:56
The mountains are old.
09:57
The forest trees are relatively small.
10:01
They’re just trying to, you know,
10:06
eek out an existence on this granitic rock, when the growing season is
10:10
short, and the temperatures are cold and so the soils are thin.
10:14
In any case, it’s a place that’s very dear to me.
10:18
I’d never like to live there again, but it enchants me just the same and it’s
10:23
captured in my heart and in my soul.
10:26
Now, when you were a child, what was the first image or memory you have of
10:34
anything volcanic, either in a movie, art, a book, a volcano—do you remember?
10:40
Yeah, there had to be two, there’s two that stand out in my mind.
10:45
I’m trying to think of the order of them.
10:48
Clearly, the eruption of Vesuvius and seeing the victims
10:53
of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
10:55
Those were
10:59
poignant
11:02
images in my mind, and I said, “Wow, wow. This looked like it had to be hell.”
11:11
It was more from the perspective of the victims and what a torturous event
11:18
this was without really recognizing the volcanic forces that led to that.
11:24
It was deep history.
11:25
It was something everybody was taught in even grade school.
11:28
Exactly.
11:30
But then what happened was you know
11:35
the antithesis of that, a contemporary eruption that did not have victims
11:39
involved would be the eruption of Kilauea.
11:43
So, seeing these lava fountains, these lava flows heading down off these shield
11:48
volcanoes into the Pacific Ocean and flashing with steam and fiery, fiery flows
11:55
of incandescent aa and pahoehoe lava and what it looked like after the fact, you
12:02
know these surfaces and so those images are the ones that stick out in my mind
12:09
and they’re very different, of course.
12:11
One is a shield volcano and effusive and the other is highly explosive, but the
12:16
Pompeii example, the Vesuvius example, there weren’t images of that to see.
12:21
I’m sure that there were paintings of it and things like this, portrayals,
12:25
but in any case, it was the effusive eruptions of Hawaii that really captured
12:33
in my mind a dynamism of this very much would appear to be living phenomena,
12:38
contemporary processes that were underway.
12:44
I would say that not just Hawaii, but other representations in the arts and
12:48
otherwise have given a lot of people a misrepresentation about what most
12:54
volcanic activities actually is.
12:56
It’s not runny lava.
12:58
It’s true.
13:00
That was my impression too was Hawaii in a Tarzan movie I saw with Johnny Weissmuller
13:06
with this fake, black runny lava.
13:08
Well, it was black and white.
13:10
I remember seeing that going down and somebody got thrown into the lava and
13:13
they died and that was my first memory.
13:15
I was like 7 or 8 years old, but also the Hawaii volcanoes.
13:19
But the kind of thing we see at Mount St. Helens and some of these more violent
13:24
eruptions that have relatively little or no “lava” in the stereotypical sense,
13:31
that’s something that most people, including you, weren’t exposed to.
13:34
Right?
13:35
Before you experienced this place?
13:37
Right and the world was such that it would be on, maybe it would get you know a 10
13:44
second sound bite on the evening news if there was some big volcano that erupted
13:50
in Kamchatka or down in Chile or in
13:57
Indonesia or some other part of the world.
13:59
You would hear a sound bite and there weren’t necessarily even
14:04
images to go along with that.
14:06
The images are so compelling about explosive volcanism, right?
14:09
Nowadays with everyone at their cellphones and all their kinds of devices and
14:14
the monitoring that happens, when big eruptions happen in many cases the world
14:19
sees them in sometimes nearly real time.
14:22
Exactly.
14:24
I don’t know if there’s any photography of Krakatoa, the big eruption?
14:28
I don’t think there is.
14:28
There’s a lot of artistic representations but is there any photography of Krakatoa?
14:34
None that I’m aware of or not during the big [SS interrupts]
14:39
. I mean it’s 1887.
14:39
1883.
14:40
’83, and so you have photography, but—
14:42
Yeah but I haven’t seen any imagery of the main eruption
14:47
that occurred in August of 1883.
14:50
Subsequent eruptions, particularly on Anak Krakatoa in the ‘20s, late
14:54
‘20s, early ‘30s [SS talks over CC]
14:55
. The new islands that came up.
14:55
There’s black and white, yeah, there’s photos of that, black and white photos.
15:00
Okay.
15:01
Anyway, going back to your perspective as a New Yorker and you took some
15:07
trips when you were in high school or afterwards across Canada, correct?
15:12
Yes.
15:12
Exactly.
15:13
But still you weren’t into the Cascades, at least into the volcanic
15:16
part of the Cascades, right?
15:18
Well, what we did was we left New York.
15:20
It was in the summer of ’78 and we had worked for months on modifying my friend’s
15:29
Ford Econoline van and totally had it equipped for taking off on this long,
15:36
multi-month camping trip across Canada.
15:38
We drove up through New York into Quebec and zig-zagged our way across
15:43
the country, Canada, hitting every providence just north and south, fishing
15:49
our way across all of Canada, BC. Then we dropped down into the Cascades.
15:55
I saw Garibaldi.
15:56
I saw Rainier.
15:59
I saw Mount St. Helens.
16:01
Before eruption?
16:02
Before this eruption.
16:02
But all [SS interrupts]
16:03
. This was, how long was this before, Charlie?
16:04
This was in 1978.
16:05
So, you’re close to the—okay.
16:07
Yeah.
16:10
In any case,
16:14
these mountains, I was like they were stunningly beautiful, as you know.
16:18
These ice and snow-clad volcanic peaks were punctuating this continuous
16:25
green ribbon of the Cascades and they caught my attention.
16:29
But I didn’t spend any time near them.
16:33
We ended up heading down into Southern Oregon and did camp out on all of
16:41
this gravely material down there.
16:45
Didn’t know what it was.
16:46
It was only years later I realized we were camping on the Mazama surface of the
16:52
roughly 7,000-year-old Mazama eruption.
16:54
Everything had blown up all over the place, including over
16:57
much of southern Oregon, right?
16:58
Exactly.
16:58
So that was my first exposure down there, but I didn’t get
17:03
close to any of the volcanoes.
17:04
It was all I-5 corridor looking out at these majestic peaks.
17:11
Truly being curious about them, having no idea that 2 years later
17:20
one would erupt and change my life forever.
17:23
Now, you were already in school, correct, by this time?
17:26
So, I took this big trip in summer of ’78 and then in ’79 had moved to Logan,
17:34
Utah, and attended Utah State University.
17:37
Now, is that when you started your undergraduate work or did you already—?
17:39
No I had—but at state university in New York for a couple years and
17:44
then transferred out to Utah State University and was working for a
17:50
professor there at the time, you know, took course work and this person went
17:55
on to become my mentor, Jim MacMahon, my number one mentor in my career
18:03
who is just a phenomenal ecologist and a character, so colorful
18:10
and huge is his personality.
18:13
We became buddies between taking herpetology and community ecology
18:20
from him among other things and then began working with him.
18:25
Anyway, let’s go to Utah State.
18:29
Tell me about what you came there expecting to study, to do, and how what
18:36
you studied and particular relationship with MacMahon, ho that changed.
18:41
Maybe give me some examples, some classes, some moments.
18:45
Yeah.
18:45
Sure.
18:45
Some things that he taught you that set an a-ha moment, for instance.
18:49
So, when I arrived in August of ’79 to Logan, Utah, had never been there before.
18:55
I had never even stepped foot in Utah.
18:58
Utah seemed really barren, really dry, and really rocky.
19:06
It was foreign to me because of all of these other things.
19:10
I had lived in the Hudson Valley of New York and hung out in the
19:13
mountains of New York and England.
19:16
Very green.
19:18
Strong cities and
19:20
this.
19:20
This was in stark contrast to that.
19:22
Of course, I hadn’t lived through the seasons yet, because I’m just
19:25
arriving in late summer where it’s arguably at its driest point
19:29
and brownest point, but liked it.
19:32
It intrigued me.
19:33
But pulling into Logan—and I moved out with a good high
19:37
school buddy named Val Pelitern.
19:39
Val was going to school down in Lynchburg, Virginia, to a small
19:42
school, did not like what he referred to as the south in Virginia.
19:50
The story’s interesting because I had applied to Colorado State
19:52
University and Utah State University and I had got accepted into both.
19:56
Val applied, unbeknownst to me, to both of those schools
19:59
while he was down in Virginia.
20:00
He comes up and said, I’m going to go out west to school.
20:04
I’m all, where?
20:05
He’s all, well, at Utah State.
20:07
I said, well geez.
20:08
So, we hopped in his Blazer, packed it up, and drove across the country
20:14
out to Utah and landed there and got settled in, found a place to live,
20:20
and started taking coursework and took herpetology and Jim taught herpetology
20:27
[the studies of reptiles and amphibians].
20:30
This person was like no one I had ever taken a course from before.
20:36
He was dynamic.
20:37
His knowledge was so expansive, so vast.
20:43
He had so many interesting stories about the ecology of reptiles and amphibians.
20:49
I had already had this strong fondness that had developed in my youth because I
20:53
grew up in the Hudson Valley which has so many amphibians and I had collected them.
20:57
I knew where to go find and collect every single species by the time I
21:01
was 12 years old in the area around where I grew up in the Hudson Valley.
21:07
This just built upon that untrained experience in fascinating ways.
21:12
Then we hit field trips.
21:14
We took field trips to southern Utah, which just blew my mind
21:18
to see these desert amphibians.
21:19
How could it be that there’s these little pockets of moisture and
21:24
they come alive with amphibians in an otherwise isolated place.
21:28
It turns out that has relevance to some Mount St. Helens stories down
21:32
the road, as these oases develop.
21:34
In any case, and then all the reptiles.
21:37
You know, New York has some reptiles, not like Southern Utah.
21:40
It certainly doesn’t have things like chuckwallas and Gila monsters
21:43
and all the rattlesnakes and on and on, and so really, really fun.
21:47
And it was great being in the field and learning from such a master with
21:52
such zeal and enthusiasm to teach.
21:56
I
21:58
immediately became aligned with Jim and he liked me.
22:05
I liked him.
22:07
Then, I took ecology from him and the ecology class was just amazing, amazing.
22:15
He, Jim, is responsible for really providing the foundation
22:22
of my ecological knowledge.
22:24
He did it in such a fun way, just because Jim, again, his knowledge of
22:34
organism, natural history, zoogeography, biogeography more broadly was just so
22:41
amazing I couldn’t wait to get to class.
22:44
I just couldn’t wait to get in there and just scribble down notes as fast
22:49
as he was firing the information out.
22:52
Then I took animal community ecology from him and again we went to Southern
22:57
Utah and did different activities, but most importantly we went to Fort Bragg
23:02
in Mendocino, California and studied the rocky intertidal and the redwoods
23:08
on this field trip.
23:10
That also opened up tremendous opportunities for me.
23:13
I’d never really spend times in the rocky intertidal in the redwoods and we had
23:18
an exercise just to sit down and stare, circumscribe a 1-meter square area on the
23:23
floor of the redwoods and then look up.
23:26
Project that square up through the air column, through the canopy, and sit
23:31
there for a couple of hours and record everything that entered that space
23:36
from ground level through the canopy.
23:39
It forced me to just look and study and record.
23:44
In many respects it’s not unlike what I was doing back as a kid at those ponds
23:51
that iced out looking at the frogs.
23:53
It was just a more systematic way of funneling your fascination.
23:56
Yeah, exactly.
23:57
I was primed things to look for and connections.
24:02
In any case, that was remarkable and then we went, Jim really liked me and
24:08
so he would grab me, and a couple of other students and we’d go off to the
24:14
Russian River and we’d go to the wineries and buy a whole bunch of cases of wine.
24:19
We’d come back and we would cook up crab and abalone and we were
24:26
at a drinking age and drinking wine and just having so much fun.
24:30
This provided such an enriching experience.
24:38
Jim was very important to me in so many ways and he became my buddy, my pal.
24:44
It
24:47
was at the end of the school year, so it was spring and— [SS interrupts]
24:51
. So, you were just like a junior then?
24:53
Yeah, that’s right.
24:56
Because you transferred 2 years in?
24:58
Exactly.
24:59
So, then there was Green Canyon.
25:03
I lived at the base of Green Canyon.
25:05
It was a beautiful canyon up into the Wasatch Mountains and so my
25:08
friend Mel, who’s from Cleveland, had decided to have an end of
25:11
the year pig roast and keg party.
25:15
So, we went out to a local pig farmer in Cache Valley and we
25:20
bought a little 100-pound swine and got a keg of beer, which is
25:26
not easy to do in Utah, by the way.
25:30
I know.
25:30
I do a lot of research in Utah.
25:32
I could tell you where the old historic brandy stills are, in Mormon country
25:36
they used to use before the word of wisdom became the word of wisdom.
25:40
Perfect.
25:40
Yeah, so I think actually we went to Idaho to get our keg to drink
25:44
in Utah, crossing state lines.
25:47
In any case, I left a note on
25:55
Jim’s door, his office door, that said, it was in an envelope, but I said, Dr.
26:00
MacMahon, you are cordially invited to the first annual Green River pig
26:06
roast and keg party if and only if you offer me a job for this summer.
26:16
So, I was a New Yorker, a little brash.
26:19
I was going to say, you had some big ones, Charlie.
26:22
Yeah, big kahunas.
26:23
In any case, we’re at the party and we’re getting tipsy and drinking and
26:29
been cooking the hog for hours and hours wrapped in foil and poultry wire
26:34
and stuffed with all kinds of goodies in its cavity and next thing I look
26:41
down and there’s like 25 of us in there, students, and up comes Jim and
26:49
he looks at me and he says, hey boy, you got yourself a job for the summer.
26:58
I said, then you have yourself a cold beer.
27:01
So, I poured Jim a beer and he stayed up there and ate
27:06
the big meal and we drank and then I went to work for Jim.
27:13
Our primary work was up in Wyoming in a big strip mine at the Kemmerer Mine site.
27:19
I worked there with Bob Parmenter and others and
27:24
interesting projects, ecological
27:29
projects.
27:29
That’s where Mike Allen worked.
27:31
That’s where Bob Parmenter worked.
27:32
This was the cradle of this group that’s carried forward 35 years
27:38
later to work at Mount St. Helens.
27:39
Part of the core science people here at St. Helens.
27:41
[SS talks over CC]
27:42
That set.
27:42
Yeah, yeah.
27:42
Some of the people that were at the Pulse recently.
27:42
Yeah, yeah.
27:42
So,
27:47
in any case, I was really interested in birds.
27:51
I started doing the birds surveys on the Kemmerer Project.
27:55
Working for Jim, the good thing is he had such a diverse portfolio of
28:00
research interests and students that were tasked with different projects,
28:04
graduate students and post docs, that we’d be heading down to all the hot
28:10
deserts: the Mojave, the Sonoran, the Chihuahuan desert to the Great Basin
28:16
down to Baja, Big Bend National Park.
28:20
We would go all the places doing these studies, carnivory studies,
28:23
desert, desert, doing the same study, shifting two weeks at a
28:26
time from one desert to the other.
28:27
This wonderful opportunity to see the west.
28:29
So here I am [SS interrupts]
28:30
. Like a series of pulses, if you will.
28:31
Here I am in my 20s and I’m just getting to see the west and I’m just lapping it
28:39
up and then winter comes and I’m like wow, this snow on these slopes are a little
28:47
remarkably more intriguing than those in New England and New York.
28:54
I started skiing.
28:55
I got to ski the Wasatch.
28:56
I really learned how to ski in the Wasatch Powder, which was remarkable.
29:02
Back country, a whole bunch of friends.
29:03
We’d just go up and we’d skin up and get up on those big ridges and ski
29:08
down the bowls, and just phenomenal.
29:10
Did you have a favorite area?
29:12
Yeah, I mean skiing up Logan Canyon with all the side canyons coming in for sure.
29:17
Did primarily back country and not so much resort skiing.
29:23
Then what happened, it was—I continued working for Jim
29:26
throughout the school year.
29:27
He kept me on doing data processing of all the pitfall samples and
29:31
such: Mount St. Helens erupts.
29:37
This is when you are still a junior?
29:40
Entering your junior year?
29:41
No, at this point I’m entering my senior year.
29:48
Okay.
29:48
Jim gets a call from Jerry Franklin, who he had worked with through
29:55
the International Biological Program, and is invited to come up.
30:00
Jim comes up in June with Doug Anderson and they scout out the scene and,
30:11
obviously, it was very limited in terms of access back then, largely helicopters.
30:16
Then in September Jim brought a larger group
30:24
up.
30:24
That was your first visit to the post-eruption landscape.
30:27
Exactly.
30:29
Then that winter the idea—we got up here because Jerry provided
30:34
seed funding for us to come up, probably through Forest Service and
30:38
National Science Foundation, a combo.
30:42
That winter we went back based on the data that we’d gathered on small mammals that
30:48
June and September and wrote a proposal to NSF, which was successfully funded.
30:55
Once we heard word that it was funded, which probably went in for
30:58
the January panel, we heard in May or June, Jim said how would you
31:03
like to be the Mount St. Helens kid?
31:06
You mean, he basically said how would you like to be the guy there?
31:10
Yeah, but he said how would you like to be the Mount St. Helens kid?
31:14
The kid, huh?
31:15
Yeah, the Mount St. Helens kid.
31:16
That’s what he said.
31:17
Yeah.
31:18
I said I would love that, Jim.
31:21
He said, well, get ready we’re starting a new project we were just
31:24
successfully funded by NSF for 3 years.
31:29
At that point, I had no idea
31:35
what that would lead to, but it led to the single largest
31:40
life-changing event that I’ve had.
31:45
Up we went in these old beater, university Suburbans.
31:51
They had names like the Desert Fox, because we worked a lot in the deserts
31:54
and up, we came and worked out of the Cispus Center south of Randle,
32:00
Washington, and north of the volcano and established a whole network of plots.
32:09
Now, tell me about your first view of the landscape.
32:14
You were in a helicopter, I take it, correct?
32:16
Mm-hmm.
32:17
Tell me about that.
32:19
What was your expectations?
32:21
What was your first reaction?
32:22
What do you remember about that moment and what you thought and said?
32:26
Right, well, what I remember is that we were at the Cispus Center and there were
32:31
a number of helicopters staged there.
32:34
They were punching out: that is, flying in different groups and dropping them
32:38
off and taking them out to gather samples and begin early monitoring work, plot
32:44
establishment, and I remember getting in the helicopter and it was the first time
32:50
I had ever been in a helicopter, by the way, which was thrilling in and of itself.
32:55
These were like Vietnam pilots, weren’t they?
32:57
Ex-Vietnam guys?
32:58
Yeah.
32:59
Exactly.
32:59
That era, that’s who you’re flying with.
33:01
Right.
33:02
I think I was in a Bell Jet Ranger and took off and up we went out of the
33:11
athletic field at Cispus where they were staging and over this forest.
33:15
As far as I could see was this fabric of green and looking, I was like, wow.
33:20
Then, you know, flying south towards the volcano and seeing it off in
33:29
a distance, but it was ashy and
33:35
muted in the distance.
33:37
But then all of a sudden seeing what appeared to be very discrete,
33:41
abrupt, shockingly abrupt,
33:46
transformation from verdant forest to just gray and levelled to first-standing
33:55
dead, scorched, and then leveled trees and it was—and then kept going into
34:01
where the trees weren’t present and over the pumice plain and it was oh, my God.
34:08
This is like how do you even fathom what had happened here?
34:13
How can this be?
34:14
It’s so vast.
34:15
It was so intense that it was chilling.
34:20
It was awe-inspiring, and chilling, and I knew then that this was going
34:26
to be a very extraordinary summer and presumably few years ahead of me.
34:33
But you had no clue that it would be 35 years.
34:37
Yeah, there was no way to anticipate that.
34:41
Right.
34:42
Now, tell me a little about the research design.
34:47
You talked about basically you setting up plots was one of your first things.
34:53
Tell me about the research design and how you went about setting
34:56
up your first plots and what you were plotting and in what areas.
34:59
Sure.
34:59
So, our focus was first the role of small mammals in ecosystem
35:06
responses to the 1980 eruption.
35:10
That’s what got us here.
35:11
That was the hook to NSF.
35:16
We said we would do work with other taxa beyond small mammals,
35:20
but that was our ticket here.
35:23
Specially focusing on the role of the northern pocket gopher, because in June
35:29
and September of ’80 we had realized
35:35
that small mammals had survived in certain locations, much to our surprise
35:41
and, two, that the gopher had survived in many places and likely would have an
35:47
important role in the ecological response.
35:50
In addition to that, I’d already been working with birds from Kemmerer,
35:58
Wyoming, in the deserts, as well as lots of mammal trapping and
36:05
doing pitfall trapping for
36:10
arthropods.
36:10
What we’d looked at is the feature that turned out to be incredibly important at
36:16
St. Helens and that’s that recognition of the pattern that the disturbance was
36:23
not uniform across the landscape, but instead, because of different volcanic
36:28
types and intensities—which, I didn’t even know what these things were.
36:30
I’m talking about these now.
36:31
I had no idea what the hell happened there.
36:33
Now, you didn’t have much of a background in geology at that time, right?
36:37
No.
36:38
None whatsoever.
36:38
Minimal.
36:39
A couple of college classes in geology and I don’t know if they
36:42
included anything much in volcanism.
36:44
I’m sure they had a section.
36:45
Of course, they did.
36:47
In any case,
36:50
it was evident, okay, it was obvious that the influences of the geological
36:58
forces were not uniform and collectively created this disturbance gradient.
37:03
We said why don’t we establish our plots along this gradient and try to
37:09
tease out what factors in terms of what was removed from the old-growth
37:17
forest ecosystem—first of all, what was the patterns of survivorship.
37:23
We saw a gradient that was really based on floristics, on vegetation.
37:27
We saw it went from being very green out far, where the overstory trees
37:33
survived but the understory was missing, two areas where [SS interrupts]
37:37
. Because of the tephra buried it?
37:37
Burial, yeah.
37:38
We saw places closer in where the trees were present, but they were standing dead.
37:43
Closer in towards the volcano, the trees were present, but
37:45
they were knocked on their can.
37:46
They were levelled, toppled.
37:48
Then closer yet the trees were removed, but fragments of trees here and there,
37:56
and then right out in front of the crater, now we refer to as the Pumice Plain,
38:01
just appeared sterile and steaming.
38:03
And so, this, one, that, obviously, if the vegetation had differential survivorship,
38:09
the small mammals must have as well.
38:11
We took advantage of that and, number one: first
38:18
area of interest was what is the patterns to survivorship and how is
38:24
that related to disturbance density?
38:26
Second, is how will the types, amounts, and distribution of
38:32
this residual component of the eruption ecosystem influence
38:38
post-eruption ecosystem processes?
38:42
We set up bird transacts, mammal sampling webs and grids, arthropod pitfall
38:49
stations along this gradient, going from reference out and ran to where
38:53
it was uninfluenced by the eruption to deep tephra, shallow tephra/deep
39:00
tephra, blowdown [SS interrupts]
39:03
. Or scorch, blowdown.
39:03
Scorch, not for everything.
39:06
Scorch we skipped initially.
39:08
It
39:11
was
39:14
pyroclastic flow, blowdown, deep tephra, shallow tephra, reference.
39:18
I circled back years later and folded in the scorch into the network.
39:27
There we started immediately sampling birds every morning between 5:00
39:32
and 6:00 a.m., starting the survey, sampling until 10:00 or 11:00 along
39:36
this gradient, sampling small mammals.
39:40
Then, on the pumice plain, in areas of the tree removal zone, which I didn’t
39:45
mention that’s kind of intermediate between blowdown and—well, I did
39:50
mention it, it’s where there were just a few fragments left of forest.
39:52
In other words, where the blast or the pyroclastic was so powerful it just
39:56
uprooted and shattered and just dispersed.
39:59
Yeah, these are non-pyroclastic flow sites.
40:03
They were hit by the so-called pyroclastic density current, or
40:05
what we call a lateral blast.
40:07
But that’s right, it was as you said: it was so close that the forces overwhelmed
40:12
the ecosystem components and even trees were just abraded, shattered, carried
40:19
away, incinerated and all that was left was maybe stumps that were all these
40:23
sand-blasted away on the volcano side of the wave of the flow phenomenon.
40:31
This was a gaseous flow.
40:33
How do you remember the “brain trust” of how this, the plan formed. You
40:39
had Jim MacMahon. Jerry Franklin was also part of this wasn’t he?
40:43
No, we were—
40:43
No, he wasn’t yet?
40:44
Okay.
40:45
No, because at this point [SS interrupts]
40:46
. Just you and Jim and that team, right?
40:48
Yeah, we had our Utah State team.
40:50
Okay, gotcha.
40:51
Okay, so we had our Utah State team and we were the animal team.
40:55
Except for people like Evy Merrill and her major professor, Tabor and Radke who
41:00
were working on elk and they did it on the Weyerhaeuser side, the west side.
41:03
They’re still doing that, right?
41:04
Yes, the northwest sector of the blast area.
41:07
We were largely—Steve West was doing a tiny bit from the
41:11
University of Washington, but we pretty much, that was our focus.
41:15
We had a lot of people and we were funded to do it and we dove in and got dirty.
41:23
We established this network of plots that represented the gradient and
41:29
began sampling them every year.
41:32
Then, what would happen, I would just come up in May and we’d rent trailers
41:36
at Cispus and stay May to September and some crews would be here, members
41:41
would be with me the whole time.
41:43
Others would be cycling back and forth between Jim’s big project in Kemmerer,
41:48
Wyoming, Jim and Bob’s big project.
41:50
So, you were already given a supervisory role even at this early stage?
41:54
Oh, absolutely.
41:55
Even though you weren’t even an undergraduate yet?
41:58
That’s right.
41:59
That’s pretty amazing if you think about it.
42:01
Yeah, it is.
42:02
That’s rare.
42:02
Yeah, exactly.
42:03
So, Jim
42:07
provided me with that opportunity, and I think I took it seriously.
42:14
It was like this is a golden opportunity and I loved it.
42:17
I mean, going out there each and every day you know first of all I
42:22
was challenged by needing to learn an entire new flora and fauna.
42:26
It
42:28
required so much effort of finding reference materials, talking to people,
42:34
keying out plants, keying out insects, keying out mammals, listening to bird
42:40
call after bird call on recording and, yes, okay that is the orange crown
42:43
warbler or whatever it happens to be.
42:47
I took that as a challenge but didn’t recognize that, but was just so
42:51
intrigued by it, enthralled by it.
42:54
I was inquisitive and I was driven, and I was compelled to learn the system.
42:59
At the end of the day I’m an organism guy and, although I focus on organisms
43:05
and most of my interests are in communities, that doesn’t mean by any
43:09
stretch that I’m not interested in the broader scale landscape patterns.
43:14
That kind of evolved with the maturing in my career and also linking the geophysical
43:19
forces to the ecology and vice versa.
43:22
But that came with time.
43:24
That was like a slow fermentation.
43:25
In some ways it’s when I think back and having this conversation of how
43:33
naïve I was back then and how little I knew, because I had to learn so much.
43:39
Your exuberance carried you through your naïveté for a while.
43:43
I think so and I had great mentors, so, I mean, Doug Anderson, who was a post
43:48
doc of Jim’s and Bob, very knowledgeable.
43:51
Then having the likes of people that work with Jerry Franklin: Charlie
43:55
Halpern and Joe Antos who worked with Don Zobel around to help out with
44:00
some of the plants just learning them.
44:04
My girlfriend at the time was a botanist and, so she knew
44:09
a lot of the plants, had been working in botany for years and so we spent a lot
44:14
of time just botanizing on our free time.
44:19
Do you remember what was the process like of getting the permission to go in
44:23
and do work and how did you have to get cleared: oh, this is a good day, this
44:28
is a bad day, the lava dome is angry?
44:30
All that kind of stuff.
44:32
It was still erupting that first year.
44:34
Oh, it was erupting through ’86.
44:36
Well, but I mean the first year especially there was a couple more big eruptions.
44:39
In July, July 25th.
44:40
But that happened before I got here.
44:41
Yeah, okay, but I mean—so, you were after the bigger ones.
44:45
But still what do you remember about that process and what you had to do.
44:46
Well, I
44:50
mean, two different points to make.
44:52
One is that there was a process and the process meant you had
44:55
to carry a Forest Service radio.
44:58
You had to check in.
44:58
You had to check out.
44:59
You had to keep the radio on all the time.
45:03
You needed to have a key to get in and out of the red zone.
45:08
In the early days if you were up close and you were in there with helicopter,
45:11
the rotors had to be kept running.
45:13
They couldn’t power down and you could only go within maybe 10 minutes or so
45:19
distance time to travel back to the chopper and so it was very limited.
45:24
It was really grab-bag samples.
45:27
I remember in 1981, I believe it was ’81, setting up a bird transect
45:33
on the Pumice Plain and then never having a chance to sample.
45:39
Just said okay we’ll just get it set up.
45:42
Then in ’82 we were going to start sampling it, but in in think it was March
45:47
of ’82 there was a big lahar that came out of the crater and when we got back
45:51
there to sample it, it had been wiped out.
45:53
It was a number of false starts just because the geophysical world was still
46:00
in control and had the biota under its thumb, which I refer to as there was
46:07
biological inertia and lots of it because the physical system still reigned supreme.
46:14
Other
46:16
places like in the tephra fall zone that we could drive to and as they
46:20
begin opening up the 99 road we got better and better access and could
46:25
visit our sites with greater frequency and longer duration which made it
46:28
just more amenable to doing our work.
46:30
In any case, there was this process.
46:32
I can remember once it was Memorial Day weekend I think and
46:36
it must have been circa mid ‘80s,
46:40
early ‘80s,
46:45
and in any case being up on Coldwater Ridge, long before there was [Highway]
46:51
504 built up the fancy new road all the way to Johnston Ridge Observatory
46:55
and Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center we came in through Weyerhaeuser’s
47:01
roads, which was like a plate of spaghetti roads everywhere through
47:04
that northwest sector of blast area.
47:06
Those were salvage logging roads or were those ones that were
47:08
already there before the blast?
47:09
I think it was a combination of roads that were there for active logging pre-eruption
47:13
and then for post-eruption salvaging.
47:15
I can’t distinguish which ones were there before.
47:17
Looking at an old Weyerhaeuser map would provide insight.
47:21
In any case, we camped behind the ridge at Fawn Lake and then would
47:25
come back over the ridge facing the volcano to work, you know, core.
47:30
Volcano’s framed right there.
47:31
You’re looking into the muscle from our sites.
47:34
I was with my crew and I’m like man, the volcano just seems active.
47:38
There’s just rock fall after rock fall going on and then ash plumes
47:42
would be going up and my crew would be nervous and like should we be here?
47:46
I’m like I haven’t heard otherwise.
47:48
I haven’t heard otherwise and every time I’d call in and you know
47:53
would not necessarily hear back but I’m checking in I don’t know
47:56
what’s going on with this batch.
47:58
Finally, a helicopter flies in and saying Utah State we’ve been trying
48:03
to get a hold of you for days.
48:05
The volcano’s active—the energy is on the rise.
48:11
An eruption is certainly possible.
48:14
We were seeing all this rock fall and ash plumes going up.
48:17
They’re like you need to get out of here right now.
48:19
Then we scrambled, dropped all our equipment, high tailed it over the ridge,
48:23
got to Fawn Lake, packed up and got out.
48:25
Why did you not get the notice earlier?
48:27
The radios were down?
48:29
So, they were hearing me, but I was not hearing them is the problem.
48:34
In any other examples I can remember being on the Pumice Plain working and the
48:39
mountain putting up a big ash plume and just literally dropping everything and
48:44
running as fast as we can out of there.
48:47
Those days were scary.
48:48
You were always looking over your shoulder at the volcano.
48:53
Always looking at it.
48:54
It’s kind of like—I don’t know if your parents in the east said the
48:57
same thing, but one of the lessons when I was small there was said,
49:00
never turn your back on the ocean.
49:02
Exactly.
49:03
That kind of thing.
49:04
That’s right.
49:05
So, those were the early days and of course as the volcano settled down
49:12
post 1986, that required less, and less check-in and roads were opened
49:21
up, so we had better access and were able to do our work with less process
49:30
in terms of bureaucratic check in.
49:34
Just made life easier, in short.
49:36
Now, going back to
49:40
what you thought ecological processes were like and how you were trained,
49:46
and I’ll reference something that Jerry Franklin probably told you
49:49
and you’ve heard him talk about.
49:51
He said that in our oral history interview where a lot of the ideas
49:55
that he was taught about ecology were certainly challenged, if not overturned,
50:01
by what he saw at Mount St. Helens.
50:04
Would you agree with that?
50:06
I don’t think that that happened right away.
50:10
I think that took some time to develop.
50:16
I mean, I think there were things at St. Helens—we didn’t have examples because so
50:21
much of the work on succession, as you’re well aware, came from old field succession
50:26
in the east and Midwest where it was harvested forest, it was an Ag land story.
50:32
That’s apples and oranges.
50:34
A lot of it wasn’t that those were wrong.
50:37
They just weren’t universally right and so I think it’s important to
50:41
recognize that the people before us didn’t have bunk ideas and theories.
50:48
They were just incomplete, and they didn’t have application universally.
50:53
This was a different setting, a different system, a different type of disturbance,
50:58
different intensity disturbance, and the responses were quite different.
51:03
Those theories didn’t hold up.
51:05
They were incomplete.
51:07
They weren’t wrong.
51:10
That’s a big distinction.
51:11
Because I think a lot of people play the card that they were just wrong.
51:13
But they weren’t wrong.
51:14
They were incomplete.
51:16
No, I mean.
51:16
There’s a difference.
51:17
You look at the history of science and it’s sprinkled with that.
51:20
Even the early geologic taxonomy that developed based
51:26
on central and eastern Europe.
51:27
Silurian and Ordovician; all these different names that came
51:29
out of those worlds and what they saw and those examples.
51:33
Well, they didn’t always fit in these other places, like the
51:36
Colorado Plateau where did you work when you were at Utah State.
51:39
That challenged a lot of geologic predispositions by John Wesley
51:45
Powell you know all the different people that came out there where
51:49
they said okay this is different.
51:50
This is a different world.
51:54
Exactly.
51:54
So, I think the first thing I focused on was the disturbance gradient.
52:00
But then in a lot of ways I think our group may have played the most
52:07
important role in terms of recognizing the importance of residuals, which
52:13
had been popularized by Jerry and others as biological legacies.
52:18
Jim McMahon was part of an effort of a paper that Jerry
52:22
led, and Jim was coauthor.
52:24
In any case, we said that if we’re interested in looking
52:28
where animals survive, we ought to look where plants survived.
52:33
Our very design included a rigid component that said by God we’re looking
52:40
at matrix that is average conditions of a particular disturbance type
52:45
along the gradient: Pyroclastic flow, blowdown, tree removal, but also, we
52:52
need to sample small patches out of the matrix that represent heterogeneity.
53:00
In other words, little islands of survivorship that are
53:03
different from the matrix.
53:04
So, what we would do is I’d scramble up these tephra slopes with a backpack
53:09
full of traps and I’d slap those traps down on these little nodes of surviving
53:14
plants and say what do we see in terms of a broader ecosystem pattern of survival?
53:21
What emerged from our work is recognition that there were all these isolated
53:29
patches of refugia, and they included many different groups of arthropods
53:37
and different families of insects as well as arachnids and others but also
53:44
different small mammals that represented different
53:50
positions in the food web, in the trophic structure.
53:53
I spent a lot of time comparing and contrasting the average conditions of a
54:02
disturbance type to these nuances that occurred because of either chance or
54:07
because of certain pre or post eruption conditions that made them different
54:14
from the surrounding area, but one thing for sure early on there was much
54:20
more internal homogeneity within a disturbance zone so they were readily
54:24
recognizable from one another disturbance zones, but with time they become
54:32
such that the internal heterogeneity of any given disturbances often
54:36
exceeds that among disturbance zones.
54:40
My whole focus has really been when looking at the
54:47
types, distribution and abundance of residuals and what happens to
54:54
those through time, the coalescence, the assembly of communities and the
55:00
coalescence of habitat types and looking primarily first and foremost
55:07
at the patterns of survivorship.
55:09
How do communities, biological communities, reassemble after explosive
55:16
volcanism that involves different types and intensity of disturbance that occur
55:22
during the same disturbance event?
55:25
Going back to the materials you had at your
55:28
disposal going in—what do you remember about the richness, or lack
55:34
thereof, of literature and stories pre-eruption of Mount St. Helens
55:39
in botany, zoology, what have you?
55:43
What did you have at your disposal?
55:45
There wasn’t much.
55:46
For small mammals, I remember looking to see what was out there.
55:51
Berks, I think he may have been in Ohio; he had some
55:57
publications on Parícutin in Mexico.
56:01
He had made anecdotal observations about small mammal species that he encountered
56:07
here with this much tephra fall.
56:10
Lizards and amphibians that he saw with this much level of disturbance
56:15
type and intensity of disturbance.
56:17
But it was anecdotal.
56:18
It was a sentence or two about each.
56:19
It wasn’t a study.
56:21
He documented the plants quite well and this was just bits and pieces.
56:26
You saw the same thing from Katmai, from the 1912 eruption of
56:32
Novarupta up in [SS interrupts]
56:32
. The land of 10,000 [Smokes] [CC talks over SS]
56:34
? Exactly.
56:34
Up there.
56:34
Griggs had some notes and other people about fish responses, sockeye, to some
56:41
of the presumably enrichment from the tephra, but there was very little, there
56:47
was the work of Dammerman from Krakatoa.
56:50
But Krakatoa [SS interrupts]
56:52
. Who was the Dutch scientist, right?
56:52
Yeah, but Krakatoa is an equatorial island and so [SS interrupts]
56:58
. Kind of a poor analog for St. Helens at least on a certain level, huh?
57:01
Yeah, and because study in earnest started for at least 20
57:11
to possibly 30 years post eruption there, there was still a big question
57:15
about what survived and what didn’t survive and it’s still to this day
57:19
called “the Krakatoa Program” and is hotly debated in scientific conferences.
57:23
It’s been a long time since 1883.
57:27
Good to know they’re still arguing about it.
57:29
Yeah, so at any case there was a dearth of information with
57:33
respect to [SS interrupts]
57:35
. Volcano ecology post eruption, right?
57:38
Animals.
57:38
Oh, okay.
57:39
There was far more on plants.
57:42
There were lessons from many, from Japanese volcanos, there
57:50
were a number of examples sprinkled around the world in new world,
57:54
tropics, and other locations.
57:59
But still overall very little to draw from.
58:01
Any studies on the 1944 Vesuvius eruption?
58:06
They’re vegetation studies.
58:10
I mean of course it was also in the middle of World War II,
58:12
so you had issues in the area.
58:14
Right, so there wasn’t a lot to draw from.
58:19
People often drew from examples of other types of disturbances, fire for example.
58:24
Okay, right.
58:27
Well, I mean what other example—you don’t have any other example in
58:31
the northwest in historic times.
58:33
That’s right.
58:35
Because there’s been little—that’s right, and those eruptions that have
58:38
occurred, say in the last couple of hundred years, have really gone unstudied.
58:42
So, activity that may have happened at Glacier Peak or Hood or Shasta
58:48
certainly were not well-studied.
58:51
At Rainier it’s been 1,000 years, really.
58:53
Right.
58:55
So, it was all, hold on a sec—so, I want to clarify a little bit what
59:00
went on before was what was available for you to study on what the plants
59:06
or the animals were in Mount St. Helens, Spirit Lake, in any of the
59:10
areas around here, whether it was anecdotal, non-scientific or scientific?
59:16
Presumption data from Mount St. Helens, the region was really
59:21
well-known for its flora and fauna.
59:22
It was not hard to get, for example, hypothetical species list for all
59:30
the different taxonomic groups: for birds, for small mammals, for
59:34
fishes, for reptiles, for amphibians.
59:36
It was a well-studied group, well-studied location Cascadia in general.
59:43
At any specific location, the chances of somebody having
59:47
studied right there, not so much.
59:49
But generally speaking, the region’s biota were very, very
59:54
well studied and described.
59:57
That provided a great opportunity, because you could say okay who is
1:00:02
the potential cast of characters that were influenced by this eruption.
1:00:06
Once I went and started doing museum searches.
1:00:11
For example, I searched all the major museums: the Smithsonian, the
1:00:14
American Museum of Natural History, California Academy of Sciences,
1:00:18
the Museum of Vertebrae Zoology.
1:00:20
I found out that people had actually gone and sampled from amphibians at
1:00:24
Spirit Lake and they sampled Maratta
1:00:30
Creek before the eruption.
1:00:32
I was able to assemble a group of species that were known from very
1:00:39
specific locations at Mount St. Helens pre-eruption but that’s not
1:00:44
the case for most taxonomic groups.
1:00:46
We knew it more broadly what the biota were and for some examples
1:00:54
we knew specific information at least at some time pre-eruption.
1:00:59
In some cases, it may have been a few decades.
1:01:01
In other cases, it may have been just a year or two.
1:01:05
Of course, a lot of the forest science information would have been couched in the
1:01:10
utilitarian world of where Weyerhaeuser and the other area around that would
1:01:14
have wanted to know versus something that would be more interesting to you, right?
1:01:19
Right, but for the plant ecologist they had a great pre-eruption
1:01:23
data set available to them.
1:01:25
Interesting enough, none of them have really rose to the occasion and tried
1:01:30
to capitalize on that opportunity.
1:01:33
The U.S. Forest Service National Forest System had an Area Ecology Program
1:01:39
and the area ecologist for the Gifford Pinchot National Forest had established
1:01:45
pre-eruption, well, before the eruption, they had no idea the volcano was going
1:01:49
to erupt, they had installed a number of plots to characterize the vegetation
1:01:55
in areas that went on to be hit by pyroclastic flows, by blowdown, by
1:02:00
tephra fall and it is quite remarkable that to this day they are the only
1:02:05
sites with actual pre-eruption data that you can get back to that those
1:02:08
have not been capitalized by the botanical scientists, plant ecologists.
1:02:11
So, nobody’s gone back and retested those?
1:02:13
There was a little bit of work in the early ‘80s, but it never saw the
1:02:18
light of day in terms of publication and nobody’s followed up on it.
1:02:21
With each and every passing year, you know, those opportunities are
1:02:26
slipping away just because it was pre-GPS, so being able to get back to
1:02:31
those sites is already in question.
1:02:37
Interesting.
1:02:37
Because people have retired, and people have passed away.
1:02:40
Where are these data sets?
1:02:41
Where’s the materials?
1:02:42
They’re right in that cabinet.
1:02:44
Oh, you actually have them here?
1:02:45
I have them right there in that beige cabinet.
1:02:48
Is it just a matter of you just waiting for funding and a new group
1:02:52
of interested people that want to go do something like that, right?
1:02:54
You could say that, but they haven’t been adequately marketed in a long time.
1:03:00
They could be, but you know, my research interests are broad, and
1:03:06
I do everything with quite a bit of intensity and I just, I don’t have
1:03:11
the time to take on anything else.
1:03:14
I generally I view it as my job to be a steward of these plots and to find new
1:03:21
people to work on them, to adopt them, or to continue on when someone retires.
1:03:25
I haven’t gotten to those that might be something I can get
1:03:29
to before I’m [SS interrupts]
1:03:31
. How would you compare the location of those?
1:03:33
Of course, some of them didn’t survive or you could even find them to the gradient
1:03:39
work that you guys did starting in ’81?
1:03:41
Well, they were distributed across that gradient.
1:03:43
It’s just, okay.
1:03:45
There’s representative plots in each of the disturbance zones.
1:03:50
Just incidentally because that’s where they happened to be?
1:03:52
Absolutely.
1:03:52
‘60s and ‘70s, probably?
1:03:55
Those were all done ‘70s, sometimes just a couple of years, even a year before.
1:04:00
There’s a plot that was done, that was installed and measured in the summer of
1:04:05
’79 right out in front of the crater.
1:04:09
Somehow [SS interrupts]
1:04:10
. Let’s go back a bit.
1:04:11
Well, I’m going to take a leak.
1:04:13
Oh, you wanted to take a break?
1:04:14
Just a restroom break.
1:04:16
Okay, sure.
1:04:17
So, when do you think that you stopped being more of a cataloguer
1:04:24
and becoming more of an interpreter?
1:04:26
In other words, you’re there in ’81 and it’s just overwhelming and you’re going
1:04:30
out and doing all this work and probably more in the cataloguing, learning mode.
1:04:35
When do you think it started transforming where you started becoming
1:04:38
a mature interpreter and analyzer of what you were doing and seeing?
1:04:43
I think that started in the most incipient stages of that
1:04:49
probably happened early 1990s.
1:04:51
So, 11, 12 years afterwards.
1:04:57
But, in a lot of ways the maturation of my understanding, my truly being able to wrap
1:05:05
my head around what all of this means at least with more clarity than I’d ever had
1:05:14
before, so it was a quantum leap and still is far from comprehensive, probably began
1:05:22
about a quarter century post-eruption.
1:05:26
Probably the 25th anniversary.
1:05:28
Something in that that really was able to start thinking about this
1:05:33
more systematically, more holistically and recognizing really what the value
1:05:40
of this whole experience has been.
1:05:44
Since then, I think that has been a large part of my charge in terms of
1:05:55
what stirs my intellect, what motivates my interests, and also recognizes a shift
1:06:07
in the roles that I play at St. Helens, not in any way giving up what I had done
1:06:14
but branching out and expanding into new
1:06:18
terrain.
1:06:20
Now, when you first got here you were on 3-year contract or
1:06:24
the contract was funding you was—how did your position evolve?
1:06:30
I mean, you came from basically as an undergraduate student and
1:06:35
MacMahon said you’re the guy.
1:06:36
You’re going to coordinate this for me right here.
1:06:40
You had some funding from NSF but tell me how that went from to what you became
1:06:44
at least in the first decade or so.
1:06:47
That happened through
1:06:56
’88 I was just spending my time, so from ’88 to ’89, okay, from 1980 to
1:07:04
1989 I worked for Utah State University as a Research Assistant and was for
1:07:13
the first couple of years a student that worked summer position in the
1:07:19
field, winter position processing samples while taking classes.
1:07:24
I graduated with my undergraduate degree and started working full time
1:07:28
for Jim as a Research Assistant.
1:07:31
I would take non-matriculated graduate courses from 1982 to 1989.
1:07:39
Every winter I’d take a couple of courses.
1:07:41
I would take any classes that interested me: vegetation analysis,
1:07:47
micrometeorology, whatever it happened to be, advanced entomology
1:07:51
or systematics entomology, advanced plant taxonomy, any number of things.
1:07:57
Take those classes for free, because I was an employee.
1:08:03
Personal interest that helped develop I think my at least
1:08:08
academic training for sure.
1:08:11
But you still were kind of bi-locational?
1:08:13
You were here and there.
1:08:15
May to September living in Washington and then you know sometime in late September,
1:08:21
late October through late April, early May
1:08:26
back in Utah.
1:08:28
That’s how that worked.
1:08:30
Then in 1989 the Forest Service
1:08:36
advertised the position as the Mount St. Helens Ecologist out of Amboy,
1:08:41
Washington, working for the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Mount St.
1:08:44
Helens National Volcano Monument.
1:08:48
Funding for that position was coming from the PNW Research
1:08:51
Station to the Gifford Pinchot.
1:08:54
I applied for the position.
1:08:56
I interviewed.
1:08:57
I was offered.
1:08:58
I accepted.
1:09:01
On April 24, 1989.
1:09:04
Not that anybody remembers, right?
1:09:07
[Laughs]
1:09:07
April 24, 1989, was my first day working for the Forest Service.
1:09:12
I’d left the university, which was really an agonizing decision for me, but it
1:09:16
was the right decision because I loved working for Jim and I became so, so
1:09:21
much part of that family, the MacMahon family, that it was a teary event,
1:09:25
really pulling myself away from there.
1:09:27
Because his family was probably like your other family out west, right?
1:09:31
Yeah and so I knew I wanted to be in the far west, here on the west coast.
1:09:40
I landed here working for the Monument and continued.
1:09:47
That was a big transitional point.
1:09:50
Because when I arrived here, that’s when I started building the plot empire.
1:09:56
Because I was here just all the time.
1:10:00
That’s when I said, okay, we have this many mammal webs, but I think
1:10:05
we need to have 4 replicates of each.
1:10:09
I just started randomly selecting new sites along the disturbance
1:10:14
gradient in each of the zones, started pumping up the efforts.
1:10:19
So, 1989 right through to a couple of years ago I have just been building and
1:10:26
building and building the plot network.
1:10:29
Honestly, I mean I have thousands of plots out across the Monument.
1:10:33
They’re in streams.
1:10:34
They’re in ponds.
1:10:35
They’re in lakes.
1:10:36
They’re in riparian areas.
1:10:38
They’re in uplands.
1:10:38
They’re in meadows.
1:10:41
For example, we had 7 bird transacts that we sampled during the MacMahon era.
1:10:47
Now I think we’re up to well over 30.
1:10:51
Mammal sites we had 7.
1:10:54
We’re up in the high 40s.
1:10:59
Amphibians we had a couple of sites.
1:11:02
We’re over, well over 150 sites that we study for amphibians.
1:11:10
Both bolstering and, in some cases, dramatically the sample effort,
1:11:18
the number of sample sites and then adding through collaborations
1:11:23
soils and nutrient cycling and different taxonomic groups, different system types,
1:11:30
really have expanded that dramatically.
1:11:34
I worked for the Monument—they let me do this.
1:11:39
But I didn’t last long with the Monument for a host of reasons.
1:11:46
I was growing less than happy with my situation here in the
1:11:54
National Forest System side.
1:11:56
People knew that at the Station.
1:12:01
What they did is through, may he rest in peace, Jim Sedell,
1:12:07
who was a funded position said.
1:12:10
“Crisafulli, we’re yanking you and we’re yanking our money and we’re putting it
1:12:15
into Pete Bisson’s team up in Olympia.” Pete Bisson and Jim worked together
1:12:22
for Weyerhaeuser years ago and Pete was now working for the Station in Olympia,
1:12:26
fish ecologist, great salmon ecologist.
1:12:31
Next thing you know, I’m leaving here, not physically, going
1:12:39
over to the research branch.
1:12:40
This happens probably ’93.
1:12:43
It was maybe ’92 even.
1:12:46
It was just a couple of—’89, it may have even been earlier.
1:12:49
In any case, a couple years here, I’m over at the Station
1:12:52
’92, ’93, and life gets great.
1:12:57
Let me ask you this—what was the problem with the Monument?
1:13:00
I was going to ask you, not with the Monument, but in terms of
1:13:06
management or rules or regulations or constraining effects on the science
1:13:13
the plots that you wanted to do?
1:13:15
Was that an issue, or no?
1:13:20
In any case, shifting over to the research branch was a better match for me.
1:13:24
This was a research group.
1:13:26
I was focused on research.
1:13:28
I was better to express my interest and to do the things that I really
1:13:32
liked to do under the Station instead of under the Monument.
1:13:35
I was a positive move for me.
1:13:39
Pete Bisson went on my time there to be, you know,
1:13:47
the best boss that I ever had, I’d say, short of MacMahon.
1:13:50
Pete wasn’t the mentor that Jim was, but Pete has so much humility
1:13:54
and such a wonderful man and so supportive and such a good scientist
1:13:58
that he was phenomenal to work under.
1:14:00
I got to stay here where my family is and where I had my home and
1:14:05
all that so that worked out great.
1:14:08
It didn’t require a move.
1:14:09
You were already pretty well-rooted even by
1:14:15
’89 when you got offered the job?
1:14:16
No, but by ’90 [SS interrupts]
1:14:17
. I mean you knew enough people here that you were rooted in the sense that you were
1:14:20
connected to the community and the place.
1:14:22
That’s right.
1:14:23
By ’92 I owned a home.
1:14:24
I had an orchard.
1:14:25
I had a berry patch.
1:14:26
I had a chicken coop.
1:14:27
I had 1800 ft2 greenhouse.
1:14:31
I was here.
1:14:36
The Station and my program and team fully supported the St. Helens
1:14:46
research program
1:14:49
and I continued to expand the work and particularly expand collaborations
1:14:56
and had a very active program.
1:14:59
Each year hire undergraduates, hourlies, undergraduate interns and then would
1:15:07
implement our work throughout the field.
1:15:08
We had a lot of fun out there.
1:15:10
I was spending in the heydays that lasted
1:15:17
quite some time, I was spending 100 days a year up on the mountain and we were
1:15:22
just living out of tents and running fast and hard both by day and night and
1:15:28
just gathering all the data we could and processing it in the winter and
1:15:32
built some of the best friendships that I’ve had out there with these people.
1:15:36
I still maintain these friendships to this very day as well as those
1:15:41
that extend way back from Utah State, such as Mike Allen and Bob
1:15:45
Parmenter and Jim and Chuck Hawkins.
1:15:48
During this time, I started becoming much more involved with steams and
1:15:52
Chuck Hawkins, also from Utah State but who hailed from OSU and close
1:15:58
colleagues with Jim Sedell, he and I joined forces about 1990 and started
1:16:05
doing a whole lot of work in the streams, which we continue to this day.
1:16:11
It was this really building of the program and the social science and the
1:16:18
science and social aspect of ecological science network that really happened
1:16:26
in a transforming way, I would say, in the early ‘90s and has
1:16:30
continued to this very day.
1:16:35
So, now we have this expansive network of plots.
1:16:39
We have lots of collaborators and I think we’ve developed a fairly respectable
1:16:47
research program out on a volcano, and we’ve done it with literally with pennies.
1:16:54
This has never been a well-funded program, but we’ve leveraged a lot
1:16:59
through partnerships and just working all the time without getting paid for it.
1:17:05
Also, the fact that it’s such an interesting subject to a lot
1:17:09
of people, especially the people that got in on the ground floor.
1:17:13
The people that are involved with the Pulse, for instance, still bring
1:17:16
their influence to bear on keeping or at least staying interested in what’s
1:17:20
going on here, in general, correct?
1:17:22
Oh, absolutely.
1:17:23
People, there’s you know generations of scientists that have worked at Mount
1:17:33
St. Helens that have become committed to the place and to the program and
1:17:38
they come back and now they’re bringing their students back and some of those
1:17:41
students are bringing their students back.
1:17:45
There’s this hereditary aspect of the work that’s happened at Mount
1:17:50
St. Helens and that’s been great.
1:17:53
We’re in a crossroads right now where a lot of the original people,
1:17:58
obviously, are approaching or beyond retirement age but are still working.
1:18:04
Others are retiring.
1:18:05
Others are passing away.
1:18:08
So, one of the most important thrusts over the last 5 and even 10 years has
1:18:15
been to recruit the next generation of scientists to continue the work that was
1:18:22
initiated in the early post-eruption days.
1:18:24
Of course, do you fear that the interest might wane because
1:18:31
the dramatic post-eruption landscape is more ameliorated by
1:18:37
ecological change over 35 years?
1:18:40
Do you think there’s still going to be just as much interest, scientifically,
1:18:44
if it’s nurtured correctly?
1:18:45
I think that the interest has not waned.
1:18:49
It’s only increased.
1:18:50
I think we’re at a renaissance, quite honestly, right now.
1:18:53
Thirty years out I think there’s more interest today than there has been
1:18:58
since the earliest post-eruption days.
1:19:01
I think there was a lull because people didn’t recognize the value.
1:19:04
They thought it was an anomaly.
1:19:06
They thought it wasn’t typical situation, therefore why study it.
1:19:09
But I think now people have universally recognized, holy smokes, does this place
1:19:15
have a lot to offer ecological science.
1:19:21
What we’re seeing is a lot more people coming and a lot more interest and
1:19:25
expansion of which is really great young faculty and other researchers
1:19:31
coming with a different bent.
1:19:33
They’re coming and using the plot data or other remote sensing data, say, but
1:19:40
they’re asking new questions with it.
1:19:44
They’re carrying on the plot measurements.
1:19:47
We’re not out of the woods yet on that one.
1:19:49
That’s not necessarily appealing I think to this younger generation of scientists
1:19:55
just to track change through time.
1:19:57
It’s hard to get funding for.
1:19:59
I think that’s where the Station plays a huge role.
1:20:01
Because they’re keeping at least a baseline bit of funding so you can keep
1:20:05
doing the continual monitoring, correct?
1:20:07
Well, the Station is.
1:20:08
That’s what I meant, yeah.
1:20:09
Yeah, the Station is.
1:20:10
But a lot of the new faculty coming in they’re asking new and different
1:20:13
questions, which is phenomenal, which is really, really good.
1:20:16
On the other hand, by maintaining some plot measurements for sure, but if
1:20:22
there’s one concern I have it’s being able to figure out who are the people
1:20:28
and how do you fund the continuation
1:20:34
of funding this core set of plots.
1:20:36
What’s really promising right now is the Station more so than ever at least in
1:20:43
the time that I’ve been working at the Station, so since the early ‘90s, has
1:20:47
been so tuned into and so supportive of ecological scientists at Mount St. Helens.
1:20:52
I think this is a really, really positive time for science at the Monument.
1:20:58
One, because of
1:21:03
the peaked interest and heightened interest on part of the Station.
1:21:07
Two, because we have all this young blood coming in that has a lot of
1:21:11
vitality and interest and enthusiasm.
1:21:18
If you were going to draw a thumbnail sketch of funding over the 35 years, how
1:21:24
would you characterize that in general?
1:21:26
The NSF, the PNW, University—how would you put that together
1:21:32
in kind of a thumbnail sketch?
1:21:33
Well, it can be described by one, there’s been continuous NSF funding
1:21:39
at Mount St. Helens for 35 years.
1:21:42
Some of the key players have come and gone and some have those grants.
1:21:50
But there’s been particularly through—so early on it was an ecosystem program.
1:21:54
It was the division of environmental biology ecosystem science that
1:22:00
funded some of the big projects.
1:22:02
There was also a number of ecology programs
1:22:08
funded through the ecology section.
1:22:11
But in addition, and to this day LTREB has still played a role.
1:22:17
What’s LTREB?
1:22:18
Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology.
1:22:20
Okay.
1:22:21
Today LTREB, there’s been some people who’ve had continuous
1:22:25
LTREB support for like 30 years.
1:22:27
Others, including myself, going on a decade.
1:22:31
That’s been important and there’s a number of people that the young
1:22:36
folks that are planning right now to get preproposals submitted.
1:22:43
There’s reason to believe that NSF funding will likely continue.
1:22:48
Of course, it all depends on how well those proposals fair in review, and
1:22:54
so NSF has played an important role.
1:22:58
The Station has played an important role, but much like NSF it has
1:23:03
varied in the level of funding.
1:23:07
I mean the Station has had early on it was Fred Swanson, Jerry Franklin, and
1:23:15
Jim Sedell that worked at the volcano.
1:23:17
None of them worked here full-time.
1:23:19
Some of them got things going.
1:23:21
All of them got things going.
1:23:25
None of them really continued to have anything going.
1:23:28
Of course, Jim’s deceased.
1:23:30
But they did stuff early on and then they more or less left the scene in
1:23:36
terms of doing work and then they come back now and then for visits.
1:23:40
Most of that original group, from what I can see in the records that
1:23:44
I’ve read, they came back the first 5 years and then some of them a
1:23:50
little bit ‘till about ’89, ’88.
1:23:53
Would that be correct?
1:23:55
Exactly.
1:23:55
Since then, not really.
1:23:59
I mean if you really look at on the groundwork it was in the first
1:24:07
decade of the first post-eruption decade of the first 5 years, first
1:24:12
half of the post-eruption decade.
1:24:14
Fred has stayed on in a way more just being a supporter of the
1:24:20
program with some writing activities, but not field work per se.
1:24:25
So, the Station had a big hiatus, say, from the mid to late ‘80s until
1:24:34
they were funding the partly-funded Monument scientist position, but in
1:24:39
terms of them having people on the ground doing things it didn’t really
1:24:42
happen again until I arrived in ’89.
1:24:47
Then when I switched in the early ‘90s, and at that point they funded, they
1:24:52
recognized that they’re going to fund an ecologist that works at Mount St. Helens.
1:24:57
But it was really the team.
1:24:59
It’s not like if you looked at the organizational chart back
1:25:01
then you would have seen Mount St. Helens ecology position.
1:25:06
It would have been Bisson’s team, Crisafulli, focus Mount St. Helens.
1:25:11
Which is a big focus.
1:25:14
The Station has never in the 35 years recognized at an organizational level
1:25:21
that there’s a Mount St. Helens scientist.
1:25:24
How have you managed to stay here in an organization that at least
1:25:28
traditionally used to like to move people around like you’re in the military?
1:25:33
I mean, that’s less in the Station, first of all.
1:25:36
That doesn’t happen in a station.
1:25:37
The research is different, I understand.
1:25:38
But it’s just a question to ask.
1:25:41
I mean there has never been any discussion of me moving on.
1:25:45
But what has happened is they provided my salary and usually a vehicle for
1:25:50
the summer and then anything I wanted to do I had no operating budget.
1:25:54
None.
1:25:54
So,
1:25:56
anything I wanted to do I had to go find, develop partnerships
1:26:01
or find soft money grants.
1:26:03
Write grants, get proposals funded to do the project work.
1:26:08
That’s how it’s been right up until just a couple of years ago and before then I
1:26:15
might have been able to get $5,000 here, $7,000 there from Jim Sedell or Dede Olson
1:26:21
or someone I’m working with in my team, my team leaders, our program manager.
1:26:26
But really something shifted about just recently, three or four years ago, where
1:26:32
I received a very modest operating budget.
1:26:36
Since then that’s been like once the current station director came on, which
1:26:42
was recently Rob Mangold, he said clearly, his words, you’ve been the orphan child.
1:26:47
He’s all: that’s going to change.
1:26:50
What Rob has done has been enormously supportive and it’s
1:26:54
right now the assistant directors have been enormously supportive.
1:26:59
Here we are 34 years out, really, and a year ago, we saw change
1:27:06
finally happen and it seems to have caught fire and has momentum now.
1:27:15
I think we’re in very good standings.
1:27:16
I think the Station views St. Helens as important and so they’re
1:27:22
providing reasonable operating expenses and support right now.
1:27:30
Even in the light of sequestration and congressional cutbacks?
1:27:33
Yeah, they’ve been fully supportive.
1:27:35
I think the idea is that what I’ve learned is that if you can go out and
1:27:44
be a mover and shaker and make things happen and make your bosses look
1:27:50
good, that they’ll get behind you.
1:27:54
I think I’ve been just disjunct from any lab.
1:27:59
I’m assigned to the OLY Lab [Olympia] , but I’m not there.
1:28:02
I have never been there.
1:28:05
Your laboratory is the field and you only occasionally visit the lab?
1:28:09
Yeah when I need to use specific equipment, I’ll go up but right
1:28:12
now I have microscopes here.
1:28:14
I have analytical balances here.
1:28:16
I have many things here.
1:28:18
If I need other items, equipment, I’ll go to one of the labs, typically
1:28:23
the Olympia lab or down at Corvallis.
1:28:27
That’s the role that the Station has played in terms of you
1:28:30
asked the funding question.
1:28:32
I talked about NSF.
1:28:33
Then some of the really, they’re the two primary, and a whole lot of work
1:28:39
is being done piggy-backed off other projects that are better funded.
1:28:43
People come up and rob Peter and feed Paul.
1:28:47
How do you think that constant synergy and attempt to find collaborators, funding and
1:28:53
otherwise, how do you think that affected positively the whole dynamic here at St.
1:28:59
Helens, because I mean it seems to me like because you were here and you’ve done
1:29:04
that and this has become your mission, a lot of the team and the continual
1:29:10
interplay back and forth had a lot to do with those efforts out of necessity.
1:29:14
I think we built out of necessity or out of desire, really.
1:29:19
Out of desire.
1:29:20
We built a complex nexus of collaborations and it’s the general notion in
1:29:28
ecology that richness begets richness.
1:29:31
I think in terms of collaborations, the more collaborators you have and if
1:29:36
you have people that can play nicely together that that builds synergy and
1:29:40
you end up with something where the sum is a whole lot greater than the parts.
1:29:48
That’s what we have here today and it’s really exciting, but
1:29:55
St. Helens has never been
1:30:00
terribly well-funded.
1:30:03
If you look at the productivity of St. Helens, St. Helens has an amazing
1:30:12
publication record and I think if you were to stack it up to places like the Starkey
1:30:18
Experimental Forest or the H.J. Andrews publications per dollars spent you’d have
1:30:25
to break the Y-Axis in order to plot them.
1:30:32
Do you think it’s because this place and the dynamic, ecological
1:30:37
and otherwise, are inspirational?
1:30:39
I think so.
1:30:40
I mean, in some ways you could argue [SS interrupts]
1:30:41
. I mean, scientifically inspirational as well as on a personal level, too.
1:30:45
Right, I think in some ways you could argue it’s apples and oranges to compare
1:30:49
the Starkey, the Andrews, and St. Helens, but in other ways it’s not at all.
1:30:53
If we’re a science organization and part of the way in which we need to
1:30:59
measure success is by publications, then that ought to be a common currency.
1:31:03
If you’re spending whatever it is, that tens of thousands of dollars per
1:31:07
publication at those other sites and a fraction of that here, you might look to
1:31:13
say, you might consider evaluating how you’re distributing and allocating funds.
1:31:18
But the reason is clearly—I mean, I’ve never even been to the H.J. Andrews,
1:31:23
believe it or not, or the Starkey.
1:31:25
You’ve never been to the Andrews?
1:31:26
I’ve never been to either one of them.
1:31:28
But my understanding of them is that you know,
1:31:33
and I may be wrong, but the Andrews represents kind of your
1:31:36
run-of-the-mill, west-side Douglas-fir,
1:31:41
true fir, mountain hemlock forest along the elevational gradient.
1:31:45
I don’t think there’s necessarily anything necessarily spectacular in talking to
1:31:48
Fred and others about the forest of the Andrews versus the next basin north,
1:31:53
the next basin south: Opal Creek, for example, you know certainly does it hold
1:32:00
anything over Mount Rainier or Mount Jeff?
1:32:03
You know.
1:32:04
There’s nothing necessarily special.
1:32:06
It’s kind of like a working man’s west side forest, is my understanding.
1:32:10
But what makes it special, I would say, is what has happened there.
1:32:15
Right.
1:32:15
But that’s the point.
1:32:16
And what emanated from that place.
1:32:18
But what I’m trying to draw a comparison to [SS interrupts]
1:32:20
. I understand.
1:32:20
is Mount St. Helens there’s nothing ordinary about it.
1:32:23
No.
1:32:25
So, I’m trying to compare the working man’s Douglas-fir forest in the
1:32:30
Cascades to a huge, you know, not huge.
1:32:35
It wasn’t a huge—to a large contemporary explosive eruption influencing forests
1:32:43
that were probably similar to the Andrews.
1:32:46
You have everything the Andrews had and now add an
1:32:49
explosive eruption on top of it.
1:32:50
Okay?
1:32:51
Compelling.
1:32:52
Let’s say at the South Sister, which is the newest of the cones in the Sisters.
1:32:56
Let’s say it was 30 miles more this way and boom.
1:33:00
So, in any case, Mount St. Helens obviously because of what unfolded on
1:33:07
May 18, 1980, you know created this exemplary place to conduct ecological
1:33:13
studies that you can’t go do in any other places in the Cascades, right?
1:33:21
It’s one.
1:33:22
It’s like a stamp collection.
1:33:23
You’ve got one right here.
1:33:24
Just erupted.
1:33:24
There’s not another one that just erupted.
1:33:26
It’s not like Hood erupted 6 years ago and you can go do
1:33:29
study that one or Glacier Peak.
1:33:32
You got this one contemporary eruption site.
1:33:35
People flocked here.
1:33:38
You could probably go do the studies that are happening at the Andrews in
1:33:41
100 different basins in the Cascades.
1:33:44
There’s nothing special about that.
1:33:47
It’s special because it’s been a focus of work there and that’s important
1:33:51
but in and of itself, I’m speculating and probably spending too much time
1:33:56
on it, that there’s nothing that’s inherently special about that place.
1:34:01
Which is one of the reasons that H.J. Andrews himself actually chose
1:34:05
that basin or made that one of the priority sites when he signed the
1:34:09
Blue River Experimental Forest, which was the original name for it.
1:34:12
Yeah, okay.
1:34:12
Then it became the H.J. Andrews when he was killed in a car accident in 1951.
1:34:16
They were grooming him to be the director [Chief] and he was killed out
1:34:19
looking for a house in Washington, DC.
1:34:21
Jesus, okay.
1:34:21
So, in any case, St. Helens stands apart.
1:34:25
It was dramatic.
1:34:26
It captured the world’s attention.
1:34:28
It captured the attention of scientists from around the world and around the
1:34:32
nation and certainly regionally and people recognized so many things that
1:34:37
can be learned here that really, I mean, ultimately you know our forests in the
1:34:43
northwest have been shaped by volcanism and so the study of 1980 eruption of St.
1:34:49
Helens informs our understanding more broadly of forest processes in Cascadia.
1:34:56
Now, the most, shall we say, pre-historic times would be an analog in the
1:35:01
Cascades would be Mazama, right?
1:35:04
Although it was a different kind of eruption, but...
1:35:07
No, I mean there would be some eruptions.
1:35:10
I mean, there’s been big tephra eruptions from St. Helens before.
1:35:15
Glacier Peak has had some major eruptions that included lahars and tephra falls.
1:35:21
Hood the same can be said.
1:35:23
Shasta the same.
1:35:24
So, there’s better examples than Mazama.
1:35:26
Mazama’s off the charts in terms of its eruptive index.
1:35:28
But for
1:35:32
those historic ones you’re talking about are still much less catastrophic
1:35:36
than the St. Helens explosion.
1:35:38
Right, but they’re probably closer than to what Mazama was.
1:35:43
Because that was just massive.
1:35:45
Massive, yeah.
1:35:47
Okay.
1:35:47
So, what about Lassen Peak?
1:35:49
I talked to Fred about that and I understand at the time that it
1:35:54
happened in the early 20th century.
1:35:56
Ecological science was literally still stuck in the Midwest back then.
1:36:01
Yeah, so I mean Lassen, I [SS interrupts]
1:36:02
. Well, I mean I’m just asking opportunities for comparative studies
1:36:07
even 100 years after the fact.
1:36:09
Yeah, and I don’t know enough about Lassen to speak to it.
1:36:12
I don’t know.
1:36:12
I was hoping to make a trip down there in early October.
1:36:15
But I know for whatever reason people haven’t seized the
1:36:18
opportunities and studied that much.
1:36:20
Yeah, it seems like when I was there it was most of the interpretive and that
1:36:24
literature was traditional geologic volcanism, but I don’t remember reading
1:36:30
anything about ecological processes.
1:36:32
Yeah, if you look across the volcanoes of the Pacific
1:36:34
Northwest what you’ll find is that
1:36:40
ecologists haven’t focused their studies on those, even doing
1:36:45
taking advantage of retrospective studies.
1:36:48
They just haven’t done it.
1:36:49
Or if they’ve happened to work on these volcanoes, they have never
1:36:52
couched their work in terms of a place that had been altered by volcanic
1:37:00
disturbance, at least that I’m aware of.
1:37:02
There’s a few exceptions to this.
1:37:04
For example?
1:37:06
Well, Lawrence’s work.
1:37:07
Right.
1:37:07
That’s a great example.
1:37:09
Lamarche, looking at the depressed disturbance induced tree line
1:37:15
versus climactic tree line.
1:37:19
That’s of course St. Helens had a lower tree line, for instance, than
1:37:23
a lot of other similar peaks in this same latitudinal gradient, right?
1:37:28
Yeah.
1:37:30
Flora was described as being in disharmony simply because of disturbances that would
1:37:37
occur at a frequency that would preclude the flora to develop to a more typical
1:37:45
composition structure as you would see in the absence of that disturbance.
1:37:52
Soil formation, various factors.
1:37:56
Plant community structures, so that the species that are there are in abundance.
1:38:00
Okay.
1:38:02
Now, going back to the earlier years you can talk about the ‘80s or
1:38:08
even the early ‘90s as your present position was forming, but you were
1:38:12
talking about some of the experiences.
1:38:15
Relate some of the experiences and memories, people,
1:38:19
instances, humorous, even
1:38:23
tragic.
1:38:24
Anything that’s interesting that would be considered a story
1:38:28
that you could tell on record.
1:38:30
It’s hard.
1:38:31
I mean there’s so many.
1:38:32
I mean.
1:38:33
Just pull out a few that are particularly memorable.
1:38:37
Some of the greatest memories came from working out in the Pumice Plain in my
1:38:43
career, sampling small mammals and so we just built tremendous comradery and
1:38:50
always the presence of surprise, because you’re looking at communities that,
1:38:58
biological communities, that starting from scratch and so each year there’s
1:39:04
always the possibility, the potential for having new species to arrive and
1:39:08
what order do they arrive in and how do their populations, so they persist?
1:39:12
Do they wax and wane?
1:39:14
Do they wink on, wink off?
1:39:15
Do they build?
1:39:16
Do they expand?
1:39:17
That’s been truly a remarkable experience to watch as community develop, and at
1:39:22
this point all but 2 species, maybe 3 species that are potential within these
1:39:28
source population within the Cascades have arrived to the Pumice Plain and
1:39:33
almost all of them have established.
1:39:35
We’ve watched development of a complete mammalian assemblage that
1:39:39
you know includes 20 some species over the course of these years.
1:39:44
Of course, you’re making this reference because that is the
1:39:48
prototypically harshest disturbed areas is the Pumice Plain right in
1:39:53
front of the gaping crater, right?
1:39:55
Even there all this is happening?
1:39:58
Yeah, exactly.
1:39:59
This is the area that was subjected to the most extreme
1:40:04
forms of volcanic disturbance.
1:40:06
There were no legacies.
1:40:07
No carryover the pre-eruption forest communities.
1:40:10
Everything started anew.
1:40:13
You watched both the pattern and rate of life, mammalian life,
1:40:18
re-insinuating itself on this landscape and including everything from large
1:40:25
mammals, such as mountain goats and elk, too, that are highly mobile
1:40:33
and can get in and out of a place.
1:40:35
If resources aren’t appropriate, they can just take off without a lot of ill effect
1:40:40
or consequences, grave consequences.
1:40:43
Whereas, also up to a half a dozen of small insectivores that have among the
1:40:48
highest metabolic rate in the world of vertebrates and they’re weighing but
1:40:54
a few grams—4, 5, 6, 7, 8 grams—and are making out to this Pumice Plain.
1:41:01
Our understanding of species-specific dispersal capacity and the relative
1:41:07
unimportance of dispersal corridors and
1:41:13
just the capacity of these organisms to disperse long distances over
1:41:19
what appear to be inhospitable conditions is astonishing.
1:41:23
Then watch how these communities develop, watch how they change.
1:41:27
And the people along the way—I cannot even begin to tell you how important it is.
1:41:36
I probably have trained 120 undergraduates in my career at Mount St. Helens, many
1:41:42
of them going on to graduate school.
1:41:43
But the time we’ve spent out there in the field together, sharing the exploration
1:41:50
and the element of surprise, the sense of wonder, coming back to camp at night,
1:41:55
making a nice meal, getting a fire going in either a wood-burning stove in the tent
1:42:01
or outside under the stars, passing around a bottle of whiskey and just enjoying
1:42:09
what we’re jointly experiencing out there.
1:42:12
It’s rich.
1:42:13
It’s deep and the friendships have been amazing.
1:42:15
The experience is watching the experiences for the young people and also fun.
1:42:20
I’d say another place that has been really important is working
1:42:24
in the Mount Margaret backcountry.
1:42:26
We would go up there and establish a camp, sometimes for a month at a time.
1:42:31
It’s a show [SS interrupts]
1:42:33
. This is on the other side of Spirit Lake?
1:42:34
Spirit Lake—the north of Spirit Lake, yeah.
1:42:37
Mount Margaret, but you’re talking about on the other side from Spirit
1:42:39
Lake where you were camping, or you were on the Spirit Lake side?
1:42:41
Well, in the heart of the Mount Margaret, so it’s right over that front range
1:42:46
looking you know from the south, north of the south part of the Mount Margaret.
1:42:53
Working in all those lakes up there, characterizing the amphibian
1:42:57
assemblages, but through time I’ve generally hired people that
1:43:02
like to work hard and play hard.
1:43:05
We would go up to the Mount Margaret for typically anywhere from a week to a
1:43:10
month at a time, and it was a hike in.
1:43:16
We could get helicopter support to fly our equipment in, because we had waders
1:43:20
and dip nets and seine nets and all of our cook stoves and tents and all this.
1:43:26
We would on some years be able to get helicopters to fly
1:43:30
our sling load in, our gear.
1:43:31
We’d hit the helipad at Meta Lake and load it all up and they would
1:43:36
sling it in, and we would hike in with day packs, essentially.
1:43:40
We’re all beer drinkers, so we’re like how are we going to get our beer in here?
1:43:47
I’m like, okay, we’ve got to be creative.
1:43:49
We don’t want to have to have a bunch of containers that we have to carry out.
1:43:52
Cans weren’t popular back then.
1:43:54
It was a lot of bottles, heavy glass.
1:43:56
I said why don’t we get a full keg of beer from Deschutes.
1:43:59
And put it in the snow.
1:43:59
From
1:44:05
Deschutes Brewery.
1:44:07
What we did was in the center of our sling load we took a full, 15.2 keg of
1:44:12
beer and put it in a 32-gallon garbage can and put it in the center of the
1:44:17
sling with the tap inside, covered it.
1:44:20
Did they know this?
1:44:21
And told the
1:44:24
helitech foreman that it was liquid nitrogen and please don’t open it.
1:44:28
We packed everything around it and then they ended up slinging our keg of
1:44:34
beer up and we would just place it in the lakes that were just thawing out.
1:44:37
There was still ice floating in the lakes.
1:44:38
So, your beer was cold.
1:44:39
We had cold beer and so we did this a couple of occasions and no one ever
1:44:42
knew we were flying kegs of beer in.
1:44:46
Then that would get us through and then we’d just fly them out at the end.
1:44:49
After they were empty of course.
1:44:51
Empty, of course, yeah.
1:44:52
Those were fun trips.
1:44:54
The debris avalanche, all those ponds.
1:44:57
A hundred and some newly created ponds.
1:44:59
No one had studied them.
1:45:00
No one had really looked anywhere in the world at how amphibian
1:45:05
populations colonize brand newly
1:45:11
created ponds, particularly after a disturbance and
1:45:14
particularly after a volcanism.
1:45:16
Of course, the chemical mix was pretty toxic at first but that would
1:45:20
gradually ameliorate over time, right?
1:45:21
Well, it just depended.
1:45:22
We don’t know much about the water chemistry, but, given that the amphibians
1:45:26
were colonizing, would suggest that all of these ponds that we studied were
1:45:34
within their tolerance limits, which suggests that they really didn’t have
1:45:41
inhospitable chemical environments.
1:45:44
But, just looking at the way in which amphibian communities have assembled
1:45:48
in these ponds through time and how that has changed, is mediated by mammal
1:45:54
activity, such as beavers and their influence on hydrology and riparian and
1:46:01
aquatic vegetation, and also how the forest succession itself has changed
1:46:09
the suitability of these habitats for amphibians and leading to switches
1:46:14
in different species dominance and
1:46:18
compositions.
1:46:19
Now has this changed the character of any of the species significantly, size-wise?
1:46:25
Has there any noticeable mutations or genetic changes or shifts
1:46:33
that are marked because of the dramatic ecological changes?
1:46:38
In spite of the size and intensity of the 1980 eruption, when we look across
1:46:42
many different taxa, when we look at the different taxa that have been studied
1:46:46
for an evolutionary influence of the eruption, we don’t see that at all.
1:46:51
We’ve looked at this with a stream-dwelling amphibian, a couple
1:46:55
of pond-dwelling amphibians among other species, and if there was
1:47:01
you know, one would anticipate that there could be a bottle-neck effect.
1:47:06
If most individuals were killed, except for some in some refugia, that those
1:47:11
would represent a subset of the genes in the populations and that given
1:47:16
the changes in the environment there could be different selective pressures
1:47:20
leading to this bottleneck effect.
1:47:25
On the other hand, if you have new colonizers coming in, and founding
1:47:30
a population, particularly if it’s a low-probably event, and some establish,
1:47:35
they are going to represent only a small, some fraction rather, of the
1:47:38
total potential gene pool and that under new, selective, post-eruption forces,
1:47:47
that could lead to this founder effect.
1:47:50
But if either of those happen, they were rescued shortly after
1:47:55
the eruption, so they were transient or ephemeral in nature.
1:47:59
Because when we look across these different groups that have been assayed
1:48:03
for genetic population structure, we find that they’re panmictic, simply meaning
1:48:08
that there’s gene flow across populations from reference sites, to tephra fall
1:48:13
sites, to even pyroclastic sites, and that it’s one big open breeding population.
1:48:19
No evidence
1:48:22
of genetic sorting or filtering leading to different [SS interrupts]
1:48:28
. Or slight alterations or...
1:48:30
We haven’t seen any of those kinds of manifestations.
1:48:33
So, basically the species or the gene pool of plants and animals in the
1:48:38
area, although there was all the death and destruction in certain areas the
1:48:42
survivorship and then as the process has been working its way in or jumping
1:48:46
in colonies and however that’s happened you basically had the same species just
1:48:52
adapting to the new environment without being significantly altered, though.
1:48:56
Yeah, right.
1:48:59
You have different community structures of all the organisms, but what we’re
1:49:02
saying [of all the communities], but what I’m saying is, of those organisms
1:49:08
that have been studied, we hand-picked some that were like, if any organism
1:49:13
is going to show a genetic signature it should be these, and there’s been
1:49:19
no evidence and support of that.
1:49:20
In fact, it’s been to the contrary.
1:49:23
And what would be the species that you casted for [CC interrupts]
1:49:26
. Well, the coastal tailed frog, the red northern red-legged
1:49:30
frog, and the rough-skin newt.
1:49:37
Any more memories about those days, humorous, funny?
1:49:40
I mean the kegger story is really fun.
1:49:44
It’s not exactly surprising, but very creative.
1:49:48
So, I mean I think that
1:49:53
there’s so many stories.
1:49:55
Sorry, I’m not pulling them out.
1:49:57
Every summer has been rich with stories.
1:50:00
I think I’ll just leave it at that now.
1:50:02
Maybe in the next half or something.
1:50:04
Well, yeah, there’s a whole lot.
1:50:08
Has anybody ever been seriously injured out here in the monument doing research?
1:50:11
Not necessarily with you but just kind of an aside question there?
1:50:15
Well, let me just state that with my crew I’ve had about 120 employees.
1:50:20
We’ve been out there as much as anybody from snow melt to snow fly and we’ve
1:50:28
never, ever once had a serious injury which is quite remarkable given that
1:50:32
we’re at the basis of cliffs and tops of cliffs, we’re at waterfalls.
1:50:37
We’re at fast-flowing streams.
1:50:39
We’re at down-timber strewn hillslopes.
1:50:46
The one thing that happens every year is we always have lots of bee stings
1:50:51
and only one ended up being problematic.
1:50:53
This year probably more than ever, because it’s the hottest, driest summer
1:50:57
that we’ve experienced I think since the eruption, the white-faced hornets and
1:51:03
yellow jacket stings were off the charts.
1:51:06
But we were working at a fairly remote site, but still drive to, on
1:51:13
logging roads, lakes in the Monument.
1:51:20
At the beginning of every year I ask my crew, I’m all: does anybody have allergies
1:51:23
that they’re aware of to bee stings?
1:51:25
Everybody said no, and so one of the employees starts walking counterclockwise
1:51:30
around the lake, which is consistent with our protocol and we’re sampling
1:51:33
littoral zones on a riparian zone and he’s in the riparian zone and
1:51:36
he steps, indirectly, of course, on a ground nest of yellow jackets.
1:51:42
Well, they boil up and he gets a whole bunch of stings on his neck and his face.
1:51:46
And he’s like, “Owe, dammit.” But, then I’m all, “How you
1:51:51
doing?” He’s all, “Oh, I’m fine.
1:51:52
No problem.” Then, I’m in riparian zone in waders, excuse me in the littoral zone,
1:51:58
and I’m walking around just immediately adjacent to him as we’re walking in
1:52:03
tandem, he on land and me in the water sampling as we go for amphibians.
1:52:10
I look over and I’m all like, wow, your face looks really swollen.
1:52:14
He’s all, “Yeah, it feels really swollen.” I’m, “You okay?” He’s all,
1:52:18
“I think I’m fine.” I look over and I notice his eyes are swelling shut.
1:52:22
I’m all, “I think we need to stop now.” So, we stop.
1:52:27
I sit him down and I say how you feeling right now?
1:52:30
He’s all, “Well, I’m kind of having hard time breathing.” I’m all, “Uh-oh.
1:52:33
Into the truck.” We drive all the way down to the Yacolt to the EMTs.
1:52:37
They hit him with an EpiPen and then just monitor him and he’s—
1:52:44
He didn’t know he was allergic?
1:52:45
This was the first time.
1:52:45
He’d been stung many, many times.
1:52:47
He built up a sensitivity and so, he was allergic.
1:52:50
The other thing that had happened was we were working in the late very
1:52:56
early 1990s in the debris avalanche deposits, all these ponds out there.
1:53:01
Some of these have really, really mucky substrates in them.
1:53:09
The same person, by the way, was walking around and he got out into the
1:53:15
pond and was doing his work but then went to move and he couldn’t move.
1:53:19
Every time he moved, he sank more and more into the muck.
1:53:23
At this point, he’s up to his waist.
1:53:25
He cannot move and it’s getting dark.
1:53:27
I’m on my way up to the mountain to camp that night and to work
1:53:34
with the crew the following day.
1:53:36
The next thing I know I have all these emergency vehicles flying by
1:53:40
me with their lights on and their sirens and they’re going up there.
1:53:44
I’m like, wow, this is terrible.
1:53:45
Somebody really got hurt up there.
1:53:47
This is going to be a bummer.
1:53:49
I get up there to find all of the emergency personnel in the parking
1:53:54
lot and my employee’s there and Josh is looking all sheepishly, and he had
1:54:01
gotten stuck in the mud, but my crew was able to go up, they ran up to
1:54:05
the visitor’s center and said we’ve been trying, we can’t get him out.
1:54:08
They’re like, okay, we’re calling 9-1-1.
1:54:11
They couldn’t pull him out?
1:54:12
Well, then they got a rope.
1:54:13
By the time the EMTs came, they had pulled him out.
1:54:17
But it was only after all this commotion had happened.
1:54:20
EMTs
1:54:22
were dispatched and came up there.
1:54:24
In any case, but other than those two stories it’s quite remarkable.
1:54:29
No broken ankles or legs or anything?
1:54:31
Nope.
1:54:31
We’ve taken other people out with us.
1:54:34
We’ve taken, you know it’s amazing the people I hire I think I just either
1:54:39
intentionally or inadvertently screen them and get people like I said that
1:54:43
are people who work hard and play hard and they just, we haven’t had problems,
1:54:48
but oftentimes other individuals from other groups want to come out with us.
1:54:56
We’ve destroyed some of those people.
1:54:58
We’ve destroyed.
1:54:59
I mean [SS interrupts]
1:54:59
. Running them into the ground.
1:55:00
Twisted ankles.
1:55:04
Cuts.
1:55:05
Abrasions.
1:55:06
You know it’s like okay they’re not one of us.
1:55:10
Let’s haul them out of here and so now it’s gotten to the point
1:55:14
where I’ve discouraged that just because people have gotten injured
1:55:18
that aren’t part of our group.
1:55:19
Even though we tailgate safely, got to look out for this, got to
1:55:22
look for that, these are people who aren’t used to doing this.
1:55:27
City people.
1:55:27
They live in the lab or in the classroom, but they’re not really used to, I
1:55:32
won’t say extreme field conditions, but rigorous field conditions, right?
1:55:37
Exactly.
1:55:37
With elements that aren’t typical.
1:55:42
People aren’t used to being in slanted fast-flowing streams
1:55:45
with lots of algae on the rocks
1:55:49
or needing to hop over big, downed old-growth logs one after another,
1:55:55
after another or going under some and then above or walking across gorges
1:56:02
that are spanned by big, downed trees and you look down and a stream is
1:56:07
blow you and it’s a long ways down.
1:56:09
All of these things.
1:56:16
What was the research protocol like under the Monument and still today?
1:56:21
How do you work in terms of the zones that are reserved for
1:56:23
science, for different uses?
1:56:25
Of course, I think that was negotiated pretty well the first couple, three
1:56:29
years when they created the Monument.
1:56:32
How does that affected research in terms of what you can and
1:56:35
cannot do in certain areas?
1:56:37
It’s
1:56:40
not been problematic whatsoever.
1:56:43
Working at St. Helens we’ve had access to all of the sites that you would choose
1:56:49
to work in, or have chosen to work in.
1:56:52
Unrestricted following the rules and the rules have been very reasonable
1:56:58
and have allowed us to implement our work without any problems.
1:57:01
We haven’t done a whole lot for manipulations.
1:57:04
Most of it is just observational.
1:57:06
In some cases, it has been applying chemicals on a very small scale on a
1:57:12
very compressed timeline to control herbivores or removing plants, physically,
1:57:18
to do at some response variable.
1:57:20
But generally, our work is non-experimental and the observations that
1:57:27
we make and the studies we’ve designed around these observational studies have
1:57:34
been able to unfold without any problems.
1:57:38
So, the biggest thing is that the Monument is very popular with visitors and so
1:57:46
we try to really increase our level of awareness when we’re in places that he
1:57:53
public is so that we work in those sites when we’re going to be least visible
1:57:59
and if we encounter people we go out of our way to tell them this is why we’re
1:58:04
off the trail and this is what we’re doing and we have a permit to do so.
1:58:08
Hopefully they will respect the integrity of the sites.
1:58:10
Yeah, but lately I mean we’ve seen quite a bit of violation.
1:58:16
I’m not sure what’s going on and why we’re seeing so much more of that now.
1:58:20
For example, bikers on trails that are clearly marked not for bikes.
1:58:24
You’re talking about mountain bikes, right?
1:58:25
Mountain bikes, exactly.
1:58:29
As use increases more off-trail travel in places where it’s not permissible,
1:58:35
more human feces here and there.
1:58:39
But by no stretches have gotten bad, but it’s just it was almost non-existent
1:58:44
and now in some places it’s noticeable.
1:58:46
Once the visitation of the Monument has gone up approximately what gradient?
1:58:51
I don’t know where they’re at right now.
1:58:53
Depending on whether it’s the north side, west side, east side,
1:58:57
west side or collective—it varies.
1:59:00
A few hundred thousand a year is my understanding.
1:59:04
But it doesn’t seem like the kind of Monument where a huge amount of people are
1:59:09
doing off, you know, back country stuff.
1:59:12
No.
1:59:12
Most of the people who come of the visitors to the Monument, see the
1:59:16
Monument via their cars, associated roadside pull-offs and visitor centers.
1:59:22
Relatively few head out on trails and if they do, they tend to
1:59:27
take short trials, or they go a short distance on longer trails.
1:59:33
So, you’re still pretty lucky in terms of that.
1:59:36
I mean you’re not, like the really high visitation parks.
1:59:39
It’s nothing like that.
1:59:41
If you were go up to Paradise on Mount Rainier or even up to Mount
1:59:44
Hood on a national forest, Mount St. Helens aside from the 504 corridor
1:59:51
or up to the visitor centers, I would characterize as getting very light use.
1:59:57
Which is good for science.
1:59:59
Yeah, yeah.
2:00:00
So, I don’t see where there’s been conflict or restrictions in terms of
2:00:05
what scientists have requested to do and approached with anything other than
2:00:11
support and approval of their work.
2:00:15
It hasn’t been onerous.
2:00:15
If you go, try to do some work in a national park I mean you are going
2:00:20
through hoop after hoop after hoop.
2:00:22
I’m not saying that’s a bad thing.
2:00:23
We need to be protective of our parks.
2:00:27
But at St. Helens because one of the mandates is research, it’s been
2:00:31
taken seriously by the managers of the Monument and they’ve been largely
2:00:36
approving of all requested work.
2:00:38
How many other monuments or parks or research priority?
2:00:44
I’m trying to think through the system.
2:00:46
Of course, this is a Forest Service management system versus some of the
2:00:50
others which were mostly National Park Service and then some BLM.
2:00:54
Right, I think it’s
2:00:58
quite remarkable that Mount St. Helens the enabling legislation
2:01:02
spoke specifically as research being one of the primary objectives.
2:01:09
I think that’s uncommon.
2:01:11
I think that it’s part of the mandate for the National Park Services.
2:01:16
It’s certainly the case of Surtsey, off the coast of Iceland where that island
2:01:22
is set aside specifically for research.
2:01:26
Right.
2:01:27
But others can speak better to this whole issue of other properties
2:01:33
that have been managed for research.
2:01:35
Now, you were a newbie when this was all happening back in the early ‘80s.
2:01:39
What do you remember about the Monument creation process and just what you
2:01:44
heard about and was MacMahon or Franklin or any of those people involved?
2:01:48
Virginia was very involved, and Jerry was involved, Fred was involved some.
2:01:52
There was a series of meetings and a number of alternatives and the scientific
2:01:58
community got to voice their opinion on
2:02:03
their view on what the Monument should be, both in terms of its geographic
2:02:07
extent, in terms of its priorities,
2:02:11
in terms of the way research could be conducted and the importance of the role
2:02:15
that research would play in the Monument.
2:02:20
Do you think they got it right?
2:02:23
Oh, I think that the fact that we had the Monument created back the early
2:02:31
‘80s and with the language that, how it was written, is quite remarkable.
2:02:39
I mean, in hindsight I think the Monument was way too small.
2:02:44
I think the boundaries could have been better drawn.
2:02:49
For example, I think it was a mistake to not have the Clearwater
2:02:56
Valley and the Upper Green River Valley in the legislated monument.
2:03:00
That provided, given that we knew over the west side that private
2:03:06
landowners were going to salvage log and replant, because that’s what they do.
2:03:11
Of course, they’re entitled to do so, and they’ve done it very well, by the
2:03:14
way, in terms of they’ve been successful.
2:03:18
But on the northeast sector of the blast area and in the east there was
2:03:25
an opportunity, and the north, so that whole north, northeast, there was an
2:03:30
opportunity in the Clearwater and upper Green not to salvage log and to replant
2:03:35
but to let the entire signature of the geophysical forces that were unleashed
2:03:43
that day persist in terms of how they influence the vegetation for the benefit
2:03:54
of millions of domestic and international visitors and it was really short sighted
2:04:01
or a missed opportunity to draw the lines where they did and to salvage log,
2:04:07
most of the Clearwater basin and the northernmost extent of the Green River.
2:04:15
Because we would have had areas of standing dead timber, timber grading from
2:04:22
leveled trees to standing dead trees to tephra fall forest in both cases and
2:04:27
now they just kind of end abruptly and you’re like oh, so what happened here?
2:04:32
That was a lost opportunity.
2:04:35
It would have given two more basins for areas of ecological inquiry study.
2:04:43
I’d say that I applaud the monument
2:04:51
and the act for creating these different research areas, to have a research admin
2:04:57
closure areas, one like the Spirit Lake basin, the debris avalanche deposit, and
2:05:03
places along the volcano itself that the primary management objective is research
2:05:10
and either people aren’t allowed in there at all or they’re other non-researchers,
2:05:16
or they’re allowed on trail-only use.
2:05:19
I think that was good.
2:05:20
I think it’s been challenged.
2:05:22
I think it’s been difficult for the Forest Service sometimes to
2:05:29
convey that message in a positive way that the public, well—
2:05:33
Respects?
2:05:35
Understands and respects.
2:05:36
But I’d like to almost retract that to say that there’s always been this
2:05:40
small, vocal minority of locals that have been disgruntled and they’re
2:05:45
never happy, never been happy with the way the Monument has been managed.
2:05:51
I think more broadly that the public visiting thinks it’s a
2:05:57
pretty amazing case study of what could happen in terms of managing a
2:06:02
post-natural disturbance environment.
2:06:05
I’ll talk to you more about the local thing because you’ve been here so
2:06:09
long and when we’re in the second half I’m going to poke more into your
2:06:13
knowledge of the people and that kind of a thing, but, no, I think it’s
2:06:17
really amazing that it happened during the first Reagan Administration.
2:06:23
Even though James Watt was Interior, and this was Forest Service, James
2:06:26
Watt was the Secretary of the Interior, that the reactionary spirit
2:06:31
of natural resource management was not exactly progressive, pro-science.
2:06:36
To me, historically that’s
2:06:39
very interesting anomaly or actually a surprise.
2:06:42
It is.
2:06:45
But I think that
2:06:48
today, if it were to happen,
2:06:54
it would have been a lot of easier I think to create the Monument and
2:06:55
it would have been a lot easier to create a much larger monument and
2:06:58
there would have been additional importance attached to preserving
2:07:04
not only the research opportunity, expanding research opportunity, but
2:07:08
also preserving the visual aspects that I described about the gradient
2:07:15
for the benefit of the broader public.
2:07:18
Because it’s not like I mean we planted the Clearwater Valley.
2:07:22
At least to date, it’s matrix land in the Northwest Forest Plan.
2:07:26
It’s up for active management.
2:07:28
We really haven’t done anything down there.
2:07:30
Talking to the silviculturists and timber planters, there’s nothing on the planning
2:07:34
books to really do anything with it and so maybe that is a lost opportunity.
2:07:39
If you look at these and we’ll go into this more later, but if you compare
2:07:44
the active versus passive-managed Monument from an ecological perspective
2:07:48
they’re very different places.
2:07:51
Should we break, you think?
2:07:57
We’re going to take a short break here and then we’re going to proceed with
2:08:00
a short tour around Charlie’s office.
2:08:24
[Break in recording]
2:08:24
Charlie’s going to take us on just a little quick tour of his office,
2:08:28
laboratory, whatever you want to call it, kind of a running commentary given us a
2:08:32
little bit of color for the record here.
2:08:34
I’ll just let you take us on a trip wherever you want to go.
2:08:38
Sure.
2:08:38
We’re on the back 40 of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic
2:08:42
Monument Headquarters in what was old employee housing.
2:08:46
We have a ranch style house.
2:08:48
It’s comfortable.
2:08:48
I have a beautiful fireplace right behind me that’s covered with
2:08:52
bookshelves right now, but they’ll be cleared off for the winter months.
2:08:56
We have a full kitchen.
2:08:58
We have a lab set up.
2:08:59
We have storage facilities both for equipment and supplies as well as
2:09:03
for all of our data and specimens.
2:09:05
Here’s where we’re at right now is my desk with my computer and all around us
2:09:10
are bookshelves with all of my reference materials and in folder cabinets, file
2:09:17
cabinets, full of all of our folders that includes all of our original data
2:09:22
sheets, which are many, many, many tens of thousands as well as field notebooks that
2:09:28
go back from 1980 to current that include all of the things that we jot down as our
2:09:35
journals and other forms of information through the decades at Mount St. Helens.
2:09:41
Each of these file cabinets has a variety of different projects.
2:09:45
Each is full with maps and the data sheets and behind those
2:09:52
are these are Cornell-style
2:09:56
museum cabinets with trays.
2:10:00
If you open these up, you’ll see we have the lepidopterans of
2:10:03
Mount St. Helens in these trays
2:10:08
where we collect the specimens and develop our collections.
2:10:12
Another one of leps here and then beetles.
2:10:15
We have all the beetles we’ve collected, some 350 species at Mount St. Helens.
2:10:20
All catalogued and all labeled in terms of the species identification,
2:10:25
where they were collected, when they were collected, etc. As well for
2:10:30
the grasshoppers and their allies.
2:10:33
Then over in this cabinet we have mammal skulls from the mammals at
2:10:40
Mount St. Helens as well as, and this includes everything from shrews
2:10:47
through some of the mustelas, the weasels, such as pine martins.
2:10:52
Then study skins of each of these that are available to train my employees
2:10:57
and students that come through.
2:10:58
Also, for identification purposes, too, right?
2:11:02
That’s right.
2:11:02
Then we have the large mammals behind us that includes everything from
2:11:06
opossums and raccoons to the large rodents, the porcupines, the American
2:11:11
beaver, carnivores that include the coyote, the bobcat, the puma or mountain
2:11:17
lion, and the American black bear.
2:11:22
So, then in a cabinet back here, we have liquid specimens of all of the
2:11:28
amphibians from Mount St. Helens in each of their larval stages that are
2:11:32
available as reference materials and then lots of literature that’s filed
2:11:38
in these banker boxes and, then, if we come around to this side, these are all
2:11:44
our plant presses, which includes about a half a dozen of them with specimens
2:11:48
from this summer and then over here’s our microscope section where we have
2:11:54
two stations set up to sort and identify all of the arthropods that we bring in.
2:12:01
This is a Spirit Lake set that’s right here I see you’re looking at?
2:12:04
Well, you see right here, this is 62 envelopes that represent the scales
2:12:10
of fish from Spirit Lake that we sampled on the 10th of September 2015.
2:12:16
So, it’s not arthropods.
2:12:17
That’s fish scales, okay.
2:12:18
This is fish scales, and these are micromet.
2:12:22
These are temperature sensors that were taken from Spirit Lake last
2:12:26
week on the 10th and replaced.
2:12:28
These are for recording the temperature of the water a meter
2:12:31
above and a meter below the surface every half hour throughout the year.
2:12:35
These had been out for a year, and we’ve replaced them with new ones.
2:12:38
Are these ones connected to the log mat?
2:12:41
These are not.
2:12:41
There are others that are.
2:12:42
SS: Okay.
2:12:44
In any case, that’s this work area.
2:12:46
Then if we go back through here, this is the kitchen, but we use the sink
2:12:52
we sort and clean our specimens and these are all fish stomachs from Spirit
2:12:57
Lake that were collected on the 9th and 10th of September, then a fridge
2:13:03
where we have our frozen specimens.
2:13:06
These are all the bags of small mammal mortalities, genetic
2:13:11
samples from amphibians.
2:13:13
There’s genetics from the debris avalanche deposit.
2:13:16
Genetic specimens from Spirit Lake fish and then if we come back in here
2:13:29
this is an office for employees to work to pin insects, such as these beautiful
2:13:36
lepidopterans from Mount St. Helens.
2:13:39
That’s gorgeous.
2:13:39
Just gorgeously preserved, just brilliant, as well as dragonflies as the case here.
2:13:45
Then juvenile fish from the Spirit Lake basin, which we’re looking at their
2:13:48
age structure as well as their dietary
2:13:54
analyses.
2:13:56
Then these are files which are not terribly organized right now, but
2:14:00
it’s the originals from the debris avalanche ponds, for willow stem-boring
2:14:06
project, for mammals, for streams, elk exposures, the lupine plots, and
2:14:12
here’s our reference seed collection.
2:14:14
From as many plants as we could found out on the Mount St. Helens
2:14:19
landscape we’d go out in the fall and we collect the seeds so then we have a
2:14:23
reference collection to identify seeds.
2:14:25
If we’re trapping seeds, we have a way to identify them because we’ve
2:14:29
taken them off of a known plant.
2:14:31
Then all of these back boxes are from all of my work down in southern
2:14:34
Chile working on volcanoes to compare that work with Mount St. Helens.
2:14:39
Here’s more fish specimens.
2:14:43
But if we go out this way through here, we’ll come to
2:14:53
our herbarium,
2:14:58
this is our herbarium cabinet filled with [SS interrupts]
2:15:04
. Pressed.
2:15:04
All of the pressed and mounted plant specimens from Mount St. Helens,
2:15:09
including lichens down below and these are all organized by family and within
2:15:15
the family by genus and then species.
2:15:18
These are then available to train the crews and up here these are all of the
2:15:24
lichens specimens up in this box that are all again identified to species with
2:15:30
the scientific name, the county, the area they were collected specifically
2:15:34
the location, the habitat, other species growing in their presence, substrate
2:15:39
and then UTM, you know, information on the special information, the collector,
2:15:46
and who determined the identification.
2:15:49
So, this is a complete set of pretty much everything is here.
2:15:52
Except electronic, what happened is the electronic copies are moved down to OSU
2:15:59
Forestry Sciences databanks, so we have just looked at the original copies.
2:16:05
The original data sheets.
2:16:07
Then every one of these data sheets has been photocopied and been stored
2:16:11
off-premises at the warehouse.
2:16:13
So, you do have backup copies to all these.
2:16:15
Of everything, yeah.
2:16:17
I was going to ask you about fireproof safes and so, yeah, I see.
2:16:20
In addition to that, all of these data are backed up on the
2:16:26
electronic files are backed up, well, they’re on our hard drives.
2:16:29
They’re backed up on external hard drives and stored off-premise, and then
2:16:33
once we get them all cleaned up, they go down to the OSU Forestry Sciences
2:16:39
databank and are archived along with the H.J. Andrews LTER [Long-Term Ecological
2:16:43
Research] site data under the Mount St. Helens folder, so we have all of this.
2:16:49
So, Don Henshaw, his crew does all that.
2:16:52
And Susanne Remillard down in.... [Corvallis]
2:16:53
Yeah, Susanne.
2:16:53
Yeah, so in any case that’s what’s down there and then we have various
2:16:59
things that we’re working on up on the wall to aid the employees that
2:17:03
are identifying spiders in this case.
2:17:06
This is looking at the dorsal and ventral view of spiders and all the
2:17:10
anatomical features and above up here’s some glomalin images of glomalin
2:17:18
extracts from the Pumice Plain soils under different plant communities.
2:17:23
Here’s a map of the debris avalanche ponds out on the Hummocks area between Coldwater
2:17:30
and Castle Lake and each of these are study sites some 100 ponds up there.
2:17:34
Is that one of the areas where the guy got stuck?
2:17:36
Exactly, yeah.
2:17:37
One of those little sinkhole, quicksand things?
2:17:42
Exactly.
2:17:42
Then in the basement we have [trails off]
2:17:42
. So,
2:17:50
you do have a basement?
2:17:52
Yeah.
2:17:58
And down here as you can see there’s tens of thousands of specimens being stored.
2:18:05
All of these samples right here are identified by taxonomic group.
2:18:10
These are all from Chaitén and Cordón Caulle in Southern Chile, all of
2:18:14
these samples that you see here that are ready for identification and then
2:18:20
ultimately for archiving in museums and over here are all of our tephras
2:18:26
from Chaitén and Cordón Caulle.
2:18:29
These are all from Mount St. Helens below.
2:18:33
Right now, we are the single biggest repository.
2:18:35
All of these boxes that you see that are carefully marked and stacked
2:18:38
here represent the largest collection of soils and tephra from Mount St.
2:18:43
Helens that there is in the world.
2:18:45
Wow.
2:18:46
This is the repository right now.
2:18:49
Off on our left is all of our camping equipment and supplies, a wood burning
2:18:53
stove, water jugs, coolers, aquaria, terraria, cots, tents, funnel traps,
2:19:02
and then everything you see in these boxes and all on this far wall
2:19:08
represents Mount St. Helens 1981-2015 arthropods specimens.
2:19:15
Tens of thousands of specimens.
2:19:17
Wow.
2:19:18
These are all being worked on by my employees and my
2:19:23
collaborators around the world.
2:19:26
These are our large wall tents up on the right and then we have two other
2:19:32
supplies.
2:19:33
This is all our chestwaders and wading boots are down here and
2:19:37
then if we go also a chest freezer, we keep additional specimens in.
2:19:42
Then upstairs...
2:19:57
One more room?
2:19:58
Yeah, we’ll just go out here.
2:19:59
We’re
2:20:02
going outside.
2:20:04
Continuing the tour.
2:20:07
Out in our carport, this is where we store all of our traps.
2:20:10
We have perhaps about 3,000 Sherman live traps for trapping small mammals
2:20:16
and then each of these cabinets outside the carport we store additional
2:20:25
equipment and all of our ethanol for processing, for preserving specimens.
2:20:33
In this case, it’s more Sherman traps.
2:20:39
In any case, that’s pretty much
2:20:44
what we have in terms of our infrastructure here in Chelatchie.
2:20:49
Well, fantastic.
2:20:50
That’s what I wanted to know.
2:20:51
I wanted to just put a little face, or, shall we say put a
2:20:55
verbal face on what I can see here.
2:20:58
Thank you, Charlie.
2:21:02
Sure, of course.
2:21:05
We are recording, yes, it’s recording, because this thing always records.
2:21:10
I don’t think I need to test it because it looks like it’s going like usual.
2:21:14
Anyway, this is Sam Schmeiding, Oregon State University, again
2:21:17
with Charlie Crisafulli, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.
2:21:22
I got it right that time.
2:21:24
Ecologist.
2:21:26
We’re going to continue the interview that we started at his office over in—
2:21:31
Chelatchie Prairie.
2:21:32
Chelatchie Prairie.
2:21:33
I always call it sasquatch land, because there’s a sasquatch
2:21:37
icon on the general store.
2:21:39
Anyway,
2:21:43
very subjective, but what are your favorite places at
2:21:46
Mount St. Helens and why?
2:21:51
Or a place, however you would want to characterize that.
2:21:58
I have several favorite places at Mount St. Helens, and for a host
2:22:03
of different reasons, but the Mount Margaret back country I think may
2:22:09
very well be my favorite place.
2:22:12
One, because it has a level of seclusion that many of the other
2:22:17
parts of the monument does not have.
2:22:20
It’s very rugged and mountainous which I like being up high and I like being up
2:22:29
high because there’s a lot of sky when you’re up high to take in and lots of
2:22:34
views and so it offers wonderful views of the Spirit Lake basin, of Mount St.
2:22:45
Helens looking in many places directly into the muzzle, into the crater.
2:22:54
It also affords spectacular views of other volcanoes in the region, such as Mount
2:23:00
Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount Hood.
2:23:03
It’s a place that was dotted, or is dotted, by beautiful
2:23:09
sub-alpine mountain lakes that were created during the Pleistocene,
2:23:13
so it’s full of these cirques.
2:23:15
They’re just gems and in this area there’s often krummholz-type vegetation,
2:23:21
sub-alpine fir, mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir that are diminutive
2:23:27
and interspersed with beautiful meadows.
2:23:30
It’s a place I like for all of those reasons and I’ve had such fond
2:23:36
memories working back in those lake systems with probably the best crews
2:23:44
I’ve ever had in my entire career.
2:23:47
It’s both because of the natural beauty and natural history of the
2:23:52
area as well as the social dimension of comradery and friendship building
2:23:57
and bonding that happened there.
2:24:00
Excellent, excellent.
2:24:08
How would you define Mount St. Helens as a place?
2:24:12
Can I say something else about a favorite place?
2:24:13
Oh, no, go ahead.
2:24:15
Sorry.
2:24:16
No keep going we’re going to—
2:24:17
Another really favorite place is in the crater itself because to actually
2:24:25
hike up into the crater of Mount St. Helens, one, it’s not a terribly
2:24:30
grueling hike, but it’s a bit arduous and no one really gets to go there.
2:24:37
It’s a not a place that has access to the public, public access, although
2:24:40
people who are climbing to the rim on the south side can look down into it.
2:24:47
It’s a very different perspective being in the crater.
2:24:49
When you’re in the crater, particularly the contemporary
2:24:53
crater, one it’s really full.
2:24:55
It’s this large amphitheater, horseshoe shape crater, but it’s filled with the
2:24:59
‘80-’86 dome, the dome that was created through dome built eruptions through 1986,
2:25:06
but also the megadomes that were built during the 2004-2008 eruption and also the
2:25:15
glacier that had developed between 1986 and 2004 that ended up being bulldozed
2:25:23
and pinched and moving, flowing forward to the north in two gigantic arms that in
2:25:31
the front of the crater they’ve coalesced so they were pushed around the domes
2:25:39
and then were united again in the front.
2:25:42
The glacier?
2:25:43
The glacier.
2:25:44
Kind of squeezed out and then compacted again together by gravity
2:25:47
as well as the rocks, right?
2:25:49
That’s right.
2:25:49
Now, they’re beginning to tip into the two, out the two drainages that come out
2:25:56
of the crater, Loowit and Step Creek.
2:25:59
So, when you’re in the crater you have 2,000 foot sheer walls, the crater
2:26:04
walls, that are constantly caving off material: big boulders coming down.
2:26:08
You have this enormous, perhaps 1,000-foot dome that is caving material off of it and
2:26:18
then you have a glacier that’s flowing.
2:26:21
If there’s a place of dynamism, it’s inside the crater of Mount St. Helens.
2:26:24
Plus, when you get to see stratovolcanoes are just eruptive
2:26:30
material on top of eruptive material on top of eruptive material.
2:26:33
So, there’s all these different layers.
2:26:34
Some of them are lava.
2:26:36
Others are pyroclastic flow and tuft that resulted from that.
2:26:40
Others are different types of domes: andesite, dacite domes, as well as
2:26:48
just regular, just volcanic products.
2:26:51
When you walk into the crater, you get to see a longitudinal section of the eruptive
2:27:00
history of Mount St. Helens, at least going back as far as the current edifice
2:27:07
began construction.
2:27:09
You get to see all of these layers cut away beautifully for you and
2:27:14
the angles at which they’re pitched, the materials they’re constituted
2:27:18
of, and so on and so forth.
2:27:21
It’s a really, really interesting place.
2:27:24
I was just there two weekends ago.
2:27:25
It’s just a fabulous place.
2:27:27
You go up there just for personal reasons or actually is there a
2:27:31
certain spot you got up there?
2:27:33
Typically, I don’t have plots in the crater—it’s one of the
2:27:35
few places I don’t have plots.
2:27:37
I went up there to lead a trip.
2:27:40
I was basically a scientific interpreter to discuss aspects of the ecology of
2:27:48
the area and with me I was accompanied by a co-leader who was a geologist.
2:27:55
That leads me to a question because of where you were talking about is
2:28:00
you didn’t know much of anything about geology when you came out here.
2:28:04
When and how did you become comfortable, conversant, and even an
2:28:09
expert to some degree on the geology?
2:28:12
Just over time?
2:28:13
Well, first of all, I’m hardly an expert in geology, even on Mount St. Helens.
2:28:19
First of all, my geological expertise is
2:28:26
very, very narrow.
2:28:28
I know the more contemporary eruptive history of Mount St. Helens
2:28:33
going back a few thousand years.
2:28:35
I can talk fluently about the 1980 eruption.
2:28:41
It’s because I’ve just spent so much time conversing with my colleagues at the
2:28:47
US Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory and they’ve been very patient
2:28:51
and through redundancy, repetitiveness I’ve heard the story over and over again.
2:28:55
I’ve read on it.
2:28:57
I know it well.
2:28:58
But whenever I’m in the presence of one of those folks and if we’re co-leading
2:29:03
a group and one of the participants asks me a question about geology, I quickly,
2:29:08
quickly refer them to the geologist.
2:29:10
Like Jon Major.
2:29:12
Precisely.
2:29:13
People like that.
2:29:14
Yeah.
2:29:14
In any case, I’m absolutely comfortable talking about the 1980
2:29:21
eruption, but if there’s a geologist around then my lips get zipped.
2:29:29
You know enough to be dangerous, in other words.
2:29:31
I don’t know about that.
2:29:33
That was a joke.
2:29:33
You know I’ve spent my career working on the ecology of Mount St. Helens
2:29:40
and I don’t necessarily need a geologist to talk about the ecology,
2:29:47
if I’m there, and what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?
2:29:53
There are people who have dedicated their lives to studying this volcano,
2:29:58
and I give deference to those people and their particular fields.
2:30:03
Out of respect, if nothing else.
2:30:05
Yeah.
2:30:05
At all times.
2:30:09
What about a few other places, not necessarily favorites,
2:30:13
but tell me about Spirit Lake.
2:30:16
Obviously, it’s the central feature that most people know about because of
2:30:20
the history and what happened there.
2:30:22
Spirit Lake is
2:30:26
a feature of the Monument, a place that I’m particularly fond of and I’ve spent
2:30:33
a tremendous amount of time on the lake, in the lake, and working on the lake,
2:30:38
thinking about the lake, writing about the lake and so you know Spirit Lake
2:30:44
was created the pre-1980 eruption, most recent incarnation of the lake was created
2:30:51
roughly 2,400 years ago by a blockage that came off the mountain and created
2:30:55
the impoundment and there’s many previous forms of Spirit Lake that were impounded
2:31:02
and subsequently breached catastrophically and released the water downstream.
2:31:07
There’s evidence of that in the geological record.
2:31:10
But the pre-1980 eruption was interesting.
2:31:16
One, because it provided connectivity between the Pacific Ocean and this
2:31:21
beautiful lake, the northern flank of St. Helens and so it co-host
2:31:26
salmon and chinook, salmon as well as steelhead trout and sea-run cutthroat
2:31:32
trout among other species freely swam between the Pacific Ocean and the lake.
2:31:39
To me there’s just something cool about that.
2:31:43
Of course, you could say there’s all kinds of lakes that are connected via
2:31:49
river systems to the ocean, and it’s true.
2:31:51
In this case, this is one I’m very close with.
2:31:55
What’s interesting is that suddenly changed.
2:31:57
In 1980 when the debris avalanche came down and blocked it, so no
2:32:01
longer were there fish freely moving between these two bodies of water.
2:32:07
Spirit Lake was for a while that, well, for all practical purposes, right?
2:32:13
The lake was nutrient impoverished before the eruption.
2:32:19
It was a classic oligotrophic lake, meaning it had high oxygen
2:32:23
levels, low nutrient levels, a high light-transmission into the water
2:32:30
column, so cold, nutrient poor, oxygen rich and good light transmission.
2:32:42
The adjacent landscape was the opposite.
2:32:45
It was highly productive in terms of nutrient status.
2:32:49
Well, those switched roles.
2:32:51
So much of this shattered forest, pyrolyzed forest, the
2:32:56
lake basin was the repository.
2:32:58
The lake became grossly enriched and all air requiring life was snuffed out.
2:33:06
A giant chunk of the mountain, the so-called debris avalanche
2:33:11
deposit, came sliding down into it, displacing all the water.
2:33:15
When the water, which sloshed up onto the adjacent valley walls of
2:33:19
the lake came back down they carried with it the ancient forest, the
2:33:27
herbs and the shrubs and the soil and all of the wildlife and all
2:33:32
the animals from earthworms to elk and bear down into the basin.
2:33:38
It became this, and because of the thermal properties of the eruption,
2:33:43
it went from being about 50 degrees Fahrenheit to body temperature.
2:33:46
Now you have what was a cold body of water that was nutrient poor now is
2:33:51
tepid and instead of having high light transmission, like what I mean down 40
2:33:57
feet deep you could see a pie tin if you were to drop it into the water on
2:34:01
a string, on a thing called a Secchi Disk, roughly the size of a pie tin,
2:34:04
it’s alternating in black and white.
2:34:06
After the eruption if you were to put your hand in up to your
2:34:08
wrist and wiggle your fingers, you wouldn’t be able to see your fingers.
2:34:11
Dramatic change and then grossly enriched because all this
2:34:14
material had entered the lake.
2:34:17
It created this grossly transformed in terms of its
2:34:22
morphometrics, it’s basin shape.
2:34:25
It was a couple of hundred feet higher.
2:34:30
In fact, the bottom of the current Spirit Lake is still above the
2:34:37
elevation of the former surface.
2:34:40
It’s twice the surface area and it’s half the depth, max depth.
2:34:44
It was raised up, spread out, and made shallower and it was shoaled.
2:34:48
So, all this material that came in, came down created these
2:34:51
shoals, these shallow areas.
2:34:53
That turned out to be the single most important factor in the post-eruption
2:34:58
ecosystem response, I think.
2:35:01
At least in the longer term was the shoaling phenomenon.
2:35:04
Before the eruption it was a steep side of the lake, which meant there was
2:35:07
little opportunity for, although light transmission was good, there was little
2:35:12
opportunity for productivity to develop because it was deep immediately offshore.
2:35:16
So, that’s changed.
2:35:18
With all this enrichment, the lake became a bacteria buffet and bacteria colonized
2:35:27
into the billions of cells per cm3
2:35:32
and just began working on all of this material.
2:35:36
I’m not going to go into all the details, but there was this rapid, biogeochemical
2:35:41
transformation that occurred.
2:35:43
What’s remarkable is that within about 3 years’ time much of those
2:35:49
inputs of the former forest had been processed, the water began clearing,
2:35:56
light transmission thus increased.
2:35:59
The water obviously cooled off because of the cooling of the deposits and
2:36:04
incoming rain and snowmelt and oxygen began churning into the water because
2:36:09
of wind action and wave action, incoming stream flow and so all of this ushered
2:36:17
in the development of a more typical ecological community that had the
2:36:23
base of the food web was driven by phytoplankton primary productivity.
2:36:28
Then zooplankton colonized.
2:36:31
135 species of phytoplankton colonized between ’83 and ’86 and following suit
2:36:38
were zooplankton, aquatic insects, amphibians and then eventually although
2:36:43
the lake basin was fishless, in the early
2:36:49
1990s, it appears that there was a clandestine stocking operation
2:36:55
that happened and so fish were entered back into the scene.
2:36:57
Just a single species: the rainbow trout.
2:37:00
We’ve been studying the system responses and just embraced the trout
2:37:04
as a new apex predator in that system.
2:37:08
We continue monitoring the lake.
2:37:10
Our focus has changed through time.
2:37:12
Right now, we’re really keenly—my collaborators at UW and I are
2:37:17
keenly interested in the log mat.
2:37:18
We’re doing a number of experiments trying to understand what role the log mat is
2:37:24
playing in the ecology of Spirit Lake.
2:37:27
The log mat is about how big a percentage of the original size of it is it now?
2:37:33
The log mat was created when the big slosh from the lake came
2:37:37
back down carrying the trees.
2:37:40
This downed forest has been floating on the surface of Spirit Lake for 35 years.
2:37:44
It’s smaller, though, than it used to be.
2:37:45
Yeah, it was about 40% of the lake, 35% or 40% was covered immediately post eruption
2:37:53
and now it’s down to 20% or 25%, but still a chunk of the lake’s surface is covered,
2:37:59
which means light that’s coming down from the sky isn’t getting into the water
2:38:04
column, but instead is being intercepted by the log mat, so the question is what
2:38:09
role does that play in ecology, because sunlight drives the aquatic food webs
2:38:15
through chemical transformation, through photosynthesis by the phytoplankton.
2:38:20
It also blows around the lake, too.
2:38:22
And so, it alters the shoreline.
2:38:24
Right.
2:38:25
It agitates the water surface.
2:38:28
It minimally retards if not prevents the lake from freezing
2:38:33
because of this agitation.
2:38:36
You need to have a completely calm surface and freezing temperatures in order for a
2:38:40
lake to get the first skim of ice on it.
2:38:42
There’s many things about this—it’s a thermal reservoir.
2:38:45
It holds heat.
2:38:48
Its’ tremendous amount of substrate, if you consider it a surface area, for
2:38:54
periphyton, tiny algal forms, to grow on which are a form of productivity,
2:39:01
so one question we want to know is what is the net effect of having light
2:39:07
intercepted and reducing net primary productivity from phytoplankton versus
2:39:14
increased productivity by all this surface area and substrate for periphyton.
2:39:20
We’re working on these types of questions right now through observational work
2:39:25
on the log mat itself and also creating artificial log mats by tethering
2:39:30
together, booming together, two log mats that we made and anchor and
2:39:36
have tethered and instrumenting them.
2:39:43
What other places at St. Helens have you not described in
2:39:47
detail that you would like to?
2:39:51
Something maybe you haven’t mentioned about a place, since we’re on that theme.
2:39:55
I think there’s two places.
2:39:56
One is the Pumice
2:39:59
Plain.
2:40:00
The Pumice Plain is just inherently unique because it’s a place
2:40:05
where all life was obliterated.
2:40:07
It’s a place that the substrates were highly susceptible to erosion.
2:40:13
It’s undergone tremendous secondary disturbance, some chronic, some episodic,
2:40:18
but the net result is a reshaped landform.
2:40:22
This is a new landform.
2:40:24
With all of this carving up through wind and water action,
2:40:28
erosion, it’s revealed different substrates that have been buried.
2:40:34
It creates different topographies which lead to different moisture availability.
2:40:40
Different topographies lead to differences in trapability of seeds and shading
2:40:48
and moisture resulting in biological hotspots and biological cold spots out
2:40:54
in the landscape and so it begs for questions regarding patch dynamics.
2:41:02
How do different patches in the landscape
2:41:07
move forward with community biological assembly, assembly of
2:41:11
biological communities and, two, how do all these different types
2:41:15
of patches lead to different beta or gamma diversity that is when you
2:41:21
consider the whole of all of these?
2:41:24
It’s a place that’s inherently interesting.
2:41:26
It’s nestled just north of the crater, the volcano itself.
2:41:30
Amazing views of the crater.
2:41:32
You look down slope into the glistening Spirit Lake basin
2:41:35
with the shimmering log mat.
2:41:38
It’s a great place, both in terms of the aesthetic beauty and hands down in terms
2:41:44
of ecological research opportunities.
2:41:47
That opportunity has been seized.
2:41:48
There’s not a place in the Monument that’s been more studied by ecologists
2:41:52
than the Pumice Plain and, so, I like it there a lot and I’ve spent a
2:41:56
tremendous amount of time, you know, who knows how many days out there.
2:41:59
A thousand days.
2:42:01
Then the debris avalanche deposit because it has this uniquely hummocky
2:42:06
landscape that where the hell do you go find that around the globe?
2:42:11
Well, around some stratovolcanoes that had edifice collapse and they
2:42:15
spewed their guts down the valley.
2:42:18
We didn’t even know where those were before 1980.
2:42:21
They’re down at Shasta and the geologists know how to interpret those.
2:42:24
It was only seeing it in real time before and after the formation of these
2:42:29
new landforms that geologists were like, a-ha, that’s how this happened!
2:42:34
For me, as an ecologist all of this microtopography, because some of
2:42:38
these hummocks are 100 meters tall and then between them are depressions.
2:42:44
These filled with water so now 100 and some ponds created that differ in their
2:42:50
morphology: their size, their depth, their shoreline complexity, the retention
2:42:57
of moisture going from spring dry to perennial and everything in between
2:43:02
and then to be able to study the way in which both amphibians and aquatic insects
2:43:07
colonize and assemble communities in these ponds and then how the marching
2:43:12
and progression of vegetation through plant succession influences the factors
2:43:20
that happen to be so important in driving amphibian and insect community assembly.
2:43:30
How do you view the cultural place of Mount St. Helens?
2:43:35
How would you describe that?
2:43:37
The cultural place of Mount St. Helens?
2:43:40
Well, Mount St. Helens is many things to many different people.
2:43:44
The Cowlitz people and other native peoples have used
2:43:49
the volcano for a long time.
2:43:51
They revere it as a place of spiritual value, a place of securing sustenance,
2:44:01
food resources, berries, fish, game.
2:44:06
Then there’s the cultural aspect of the dimension of the scientific community.
2:44:13
Mount St. Helens was a watershed event that shaped both the geological
2:44:18
and ecological science, at least disturbance ecology, in ways that we
2:44:22
never could have anticipated and so it’s been a hot bed of research activity.
2:44:29
It’s been a training ground for the young and the old scientists and it continues
2:44:37
to provide lessons on a regular basis.
2:44:42
If you look at its publication record, it eclipses that of all other volcanoes,
2:44:46
all other natural disturbances and so it’s become the granddaddy that
2:44:50
others turn to when they’re faced with volcano disturbance, even other forms
2:44:56
of disturbance to provide insights.
2:45:00
Not only what lessons were learned here but how might scientists or
2:45:07
managers go about taking advantage of the opportunities that present
2:45:12
themselves at other sites.
2:45:17
From a non-native people, non-science perspective just the boarder public
2:45:23
cultural aspect, it’s a place that people come for spiritual renewal.
2:45:28
They come to hike and just to be.
2:45:31
They come to look out and gaze out over the landscape.
2:45:33
They come to ponder the powers of nature, the geological, raw geological energy and
2:45:41
also the equally compelling renewal power of life and so, obviously, it instills
2:45:49
a tremendous amount of thought and curiosity, but, also, it’s very compelling
2:45:56
in the way it presents the notion of hope.
2:46:01
From the cold dark ashes spring forth life and renewal.
2:46:05
That’s a wonderful metaphor for all of us, because we all lose loved ones
2:46:10
eventually, sometimes prematurely.
2:46:13
We go through divorce.
2:46:15
We have illness.
2:46:17
All of these things that inflict us: drug addiction, alcohol addiction that bring
2:46:21
us to the lulls, to places of despair.
2:46:26
If we’re scrapping and have some tenacity, we bounce back.
2:46:33
Mount St. Helens shows us how hard a knock you can take and still get up,
2:46:41
dust yourself off and find your way.
2:46:48
All those times that you were out
2:46:51
with teams, camping out and you were talking about the good times, specifically
2:46:56
in the Pumice Plain or right in the front, do you sense that the discussions had
2:47:02
more cosmological reflective elements to it because of where you were?
2:47:08
Sometimes there’s that magical element, for sure.
2:47:13
It is a wonderful place to learn and to always
2:47:25
be caught off guard when something presents itself in a way that you
2:47:30
weren’t expecting and also for young scientists and older alike, for that
2:47:39
matter, it provides a great place to have friendly debate and discussions about
2:47:48
what might be the underlying factors, the driving forces that lead to some
2:47:54
observation, some patterns you’ve seen.
2:47:57
Then you often have the luxury of being around to see well
2:48:05
how did that really play out.
2:48:07
That’s the beauty of this long-term research.
2:48:11
You outlast the vagaries of any one wet spell or dry spell or insect
2:48:17
outbreak and you start looking at these more, you’re able to look
2:48:21
at these more emerging properties.
2:48:23
The average NSF proposal cycle is probably 3 years.
2:48:27
The average graduate is a year or two for a masters, maybe 3
2:48:31
or 4 field seasons for a Ph.D.
2:48:35
I just finished—my crew is still out there today, we’ll be wrapping
2:48:38
up next week, we’ve been out there since the first week of May.
2:48:41
We’ll be out there until October 1st.
2:48:43
Every single week a small army out there gathering data, well,
2:48:48
you know thirty-five years, okay?
2:48:51
That’s a lot of 3-year grant cycles, 2-year master students, or 4 or
2:48:56
5-year field seasons for a Ph.D.
2:49:01
It’s been a wonderful opportunity to,
2:49:07
this may be getting towards a capstone, so I don’t know I better be careful.
2:49:11
Well, we’re not done yet, but if you want to do a capstone
2:49:14
[CC talks over SS] go ahead.
2:49:14
No, I don’t but there’s this wonderful opportunity to get to know a place.
2:49:22
For Mount St. Helens for me it’s one of the bright spots about this whole ride,
2:49:26
this whole long, strange trip has been
2:49:32
getting to know a cast of characters and getting to know a place really thoroughly.
2:49:37
How often, you know, even at, I don’t know, the LTER sites, or other places
2:49:43
are long-term ecological research I just wonder if we went around
2:49:46
to all the LTER sites how often do you have someone who’s been in the
2:49:52
trenches for 35 years and learned all the taxa and knows all the sites.
2:50:00
These are special places, like the LTER and Mount St. Helens.
2:50:04
It happens at those places, I’m sure, and it’s happened at Mount St. Helens,
2:50:07
but probably not a lot of places.
2:50:10
Those individuals that get that deeply in tune with the place, it provides
2:50:20
just tremendously rich experiences.
2:50:23
When did you know you were going to stay?
2:50:23
Like for the
2:50:29
whole duration?
2:50:30
When they told me, I wasn’t going to go.
2:50:32
I mean, in other words, when I got my permanent position.
2:50:36
So, ’89 or ’90?
2:50:39
Yeah, exactly.
2:50:40
I mean, I knew then.
2:50:42
Well, it probably was ’92 when my position finally went permanent.
2:50:45
So at that point, I’m like here I am, I’m young, I’m in this arena that provides
2:50:55
some of the most interesting ecological research opportunities I could probably
2:51:01
ever hope for dealing with all levels of biological organizations: from molecular,
2:51:08
I don’t do much with cells, from molecular, to individuals, populations,
2:51:14
communities, ecosystems across a variety of taxonomic groups from microbes to
2:51:19
mammals, different system types, including lakes and streams and seeps, riparian
2:51:27
areas, meadows, uplands and along a gradient of all these different community
2:51:32
types, like forest to early seral
2:51:36
communities.
2:51:39
It was a wonderful opportunity and I never grew tired of it.
2:51:43
Never.
2:51:44
Never.
2:51:44
Even today?
2:51:46
Not tired of it a bit.
2:51:47
There’s only one thing that right now I would say is different.
2:51:51
I’ve been feeling it for the last couple of years.
2:51:54
That’s that I no longer, I mean, I think my career has been unusual, I think.
2:52:01
In talking to many, many, many collaborators and others I think
2:52:06
it’s probably true: I had a long, long run of being a field ecologist.
2:52:13
In the trenches gathering data every single day with my crew.
2:52:18
Scuffing
2:52:20
small mammals out of the trap, swinging dip nets through the ponds,
2:52:25
setting strains in the streams, calibrating around quadrats for
2:52:29
vegetation, digging soil pits.
2:52:31
I mean, I’ve been living that.
2:52:33
This was my 36th field season this year.
2:52:37
Like I was out training my crew a week ago Tuesday, so it’ll be a week tomorrow, and
2:52:47
on the willow sampling, sampling willows for both volume, attack rate
2:52:53
by the willow stem-boring beetle, and other features, and it’s like I did it
2:52:58
for the afternoon and I’m like, yeah, I’m glad I’m going onto something—I
2:53:01
don’t want to just sit with my head in willows all day long anymore.
2:53:06
I want to go out.
2:53:07
I want to train my crews.
2:53:09
I want to sample it for a day or two, each of the things, but I no longer
2:53:14
want to trap every single night of the 6-night trapping session.
2:53:18
It’s changed and now my interests are far more
2:53:26
in pulling in, it’s like this giant octopus with all these arms out
2:53:31
there, and I’m much more interested in coalescing and bringing information
2:53:37
into some central point and to make sense of it and to secure it for
2:53:44
future use and to tell stories.
2:53:49
To that end, I put in a proposal two years ago to get funding to start
2:53:59
dealing with the backlog of tens of thousands of specimens: spiders, insects,
2:54:06
plankton, mammals, amphibians, fish and work to create collaborations with
2:54:14
the Smithsonian, the California Academy of Sciences, Museum of Southwestern
2:54:19
Biology, the Burke Museum and the National Museum in Sydney, Australia
2:54:25
and now archiving specimens: sorting them, getting them identified by
2:54:30
the leading experts, when necessary.
2:54:32
If not, I’m doing it or a collaborator’s doing it and assessing all of these
2:54:38
specimens into these reputable repositories so they’re available
2:54:43
in perpetuity for future generations complete with electronic databases
2:54:49
that go along with all of the specimen records, and so that’s all there.
2:54:56
I’ve been doing a lot of that.
2:54:58
On the cyber side, taking all of our physical data sheets and making sure that
2:55:06
all of those data go through proper QAQC, that summaries are made to disseminate
2:55:13
information and that those original forms of those data get archived in
2:55:20
a databank and safeguarded from loss.
2:55:24
That has been a huge mission.
2:55:26
I mentioned just two years, but it’s been going on more like for 10 years.
2:55:30
I’ve just had funding for it now.
2:55:33
Before I was just doing it.
2:55:36
That’s been gratifying.
2:55:37
I put over 700 small mammals into the Burke Museum alone.
2:55:41
Another 350 down in the Museum of Southwestern Biology in Albuquerque,
2:55:45
University of New Mexico.
2:55:46
The Burke Museum’s at UW [University of Washington] . Lots of that kind of
2:55:50
activity, but also trying to distill the lessons from St. Helens and provide that
2:55:58
information to a number of different avenues to different audiences, from
2:56:04
scientific conference participants that are coming to the Portland, Seattle
2:56:08
area to take them out on St. Helens fieldtrips as part of the conferences
2:56:13
in one of those cities, for example.
2:56:17
Creating, organizing or co-organizing symposium at these conferences about
2:56:22
Mount St. Helens so that we’re sharing our research results, the Mount St. Helens
2:56:27
community with this broader ecological community, national and region, getting
2:56:33
our information out onto various websites and into different interpretive groups
2:56:39
and scientific educators, so curriculum can be developed for largely middle and
2:56:44
high school age students so they can learn from the lessons of Mount St. Helens and
2:56:50
do all kind of field trips and outings.
2:56:52
Then, of course through publications, like the book we’re working on right now the
2:56:57
second Springer book, which I’m co-editor and also author [SS talks over CC]
2:57:02
. This will be the 35-year book, right?
2:57:06
Yeah, the 35-year book that’s probably going to come out in 36 to 37.
2:57:10
Yeah, right.
2:57:12
Right now, it’s a misnomer to call it a 35.
2:57:14
That was the target and we’re woefully behind, but nonetheless we’re making
2:57:18
headway, and this fall I’m going to really put a concerted effort into the book.
2:57:23
Then, finally, and what I consider to this point to perhaps be the highlight
2:57:30
of my career is taking the lessons from Mount St. Helens and applying them to
2:57:36
different volcanic settings around the globe and thinking about volcano ecology
2:57:42
from a global perspective and testing the general lessons from Mount St.
2:57:48
Helens that other volcanic settings to ask the question to what extent are the
2:57:54
lessons from Mount St. Helens general and have universal applications and to
2:57:59
what degree are they idiosyncratic and have something specific either to do with
2:58:04
the biota or to do with the setting of St. Helens or the timing of the eruption
2:58:08
or the characteristic of the eruption.
2:58:10
That is really what I want to focus on for the remainder of my career.
2:58:14
You would probably find, Charlie, that there would be a little of both.
2:58:19
There would be some universality and some unique aspect, like the debris
2:58:22
avalanche, the size of the landslide you’ve rarely seen that in recent
2:58:26
volcanic history, for instance.
2:58:28
But with some of the features.
2:58:30
Right, but regardless of that if you even have a new formed lake or a lake
2:58:34
where everything was snuffed out at a different volcano, is the pace and
2:58:38
pattern of amphibian colonization similar?
2:58:41
Well, that part, yeah.
2:58:44
Yeah.
2:58:44
I’m interested in more from the ecological perspective, but we
2:58:47
do know that the geology story is
2:58:54
a prerequisite.
2:58:55
It’s required to tell the ecological story and the reverse is true.
2:59:01
These two fields of science really inform, strengthen our overall understanding
2:59:08
by having a good understanding of each.
2:59:11
One can’t live without the other.
2:59:13
Yeah.
2:59:14
In any case, I’m not sure where we are in terms of where we started, but I’ll stop.
2:59:22
You spent a lot of time talking about Jim MacMahon.
2:59:26
Talk about some other important mentors, or just people here,
2:59:31
scientists who contributed greatly that you’d like to make note of.
2:59:36
Sure.
2:59:36
I’d say I have
2:59:42
four, and I may add to it as this list goes on.
2:59:45
I’d say hands down the single most important mentor in my life with
2:59:52
respect to my career is James A. MacMahon, Utah State University.
2:59:59
Jim has believed in me.
3:00:02
He trusted in me.
3:00:04
He took some risk putting me in the positions he did, and I think
3:00:10
if we were to ask him, he’d say Crisafulli did an okay job with that.
3:00:14
He’s still around, isn’t he?
3:00:15
Oh yeah, he is.
3:00:15
Yeah.
3:00:16
And we still work together.
3:00:19
He’s a dear friend and I am forever in his debt.
3:00:22
I’m loyal to a fault in that regard.
3:00:27
But Jim’s deserving of everything.
3:00:31
Then Chuck Hawkins, aquatic ecologist from Utah State.
3:00:35
Chuck has been very important in my understanding of the
3:00:39
Mount St. Helens stream systems.
3:00:43
Plus, a good friend, colleague and Chuck and I, I can just remember sampling
3:00:50
all these streams in the Clearwater and other basins, the Green, the Bean,
3:00:54
the Smith and we were interested in looking at the nocturnal behavior,
3:01:00
excuse me, looking at the behavior of the coastal tail frog in response
3:01:05
to predator cues, non-visual cues.
3:01:07
We set up all these in-stream experiments and every half hour throughout the night
3:01:14
we would walk down the stream with our headlamps and we would check to see
3:01:18
how many tadpoles were out foraging where upstream in a cage from them
3:01:23
that was attached at an experimental trough was either a cutthroat trout, a
3:01:28
brook trout, a sculpin or any number of potential predators at control sites.
3:01:35
Just really fond memories of staying up all night long and how rummy we would get.
3:01:41
We’d just talk about all the stuff, all about the frogs.
3:01:44
How esoteric.
3:01:45
We would spend hours upon hours upon hours, night after night after
3:01:50
night discussing the ecology of the tail frog in these streams.
3:01:55
It was a blast.
3:01:57
We would of course at some point we’d drink some beers and we had to
3:02:01
stay up all night so those were not the drinking nights by any stretch.
3:02:04
But the stories—I can remember just laying out on these big, blown-down
3:02:09
logs in August when [I’ll probably get to this] the Perseids meteorite
3:02:14
showers—it’s the meteorite showers, and just watching the entire Clearwater
3:02:18
valley just light up with these streaming meteorites flashing through the basin.
3:02:24
I mean that’s burned
3:02:27
indelibly in my mind, in my memory.
3:02:32
Lots of cool work with Chuck.
3:02:34
A good guy.
3:02:35
Then I would say you know Fred Swanson is a primary mentor and
3:02:40
what Fred—and each of these people offered me something different.
3:02:43
Fred’s
3:02:47
biggest gift to me has been I’d say the branching of the physical and life
3:02:55
sciences and that crosswalk between the two, the importance of paying
3:03:01
attention to both and broad thinking.
3:03:05
I mean, my natural tendency is minutia.
3:03:12
It’s easy to get lost in the minutia.
3:03:15
I never felt lost in it, but it’s just so much facts.
3:03:18
I’d say, “Fred why don’t you take note of these things?” He said,
3:03:24
“I can’t possibly remember them.
3:03:25
I don’t know how you do it.
3:03:26
It’s not my thing.
3:03:28
I couldn’t do it even if I wanted to.” So, Fred thinks in broad scales.
3:03:35
He thinks in platitudes.
3:03:37
To some extent he waves his arm and Fred is scholarly.
3:03:42
Fred, I think, reads a lot, and this sounds so condescending [it’s not meant
3:03:47
that way]: he reads a lot and does little.
3:03:51
Fred is an idea guy.
3:03:52
Fred is not a doer guy in terms of getting in and getting dirty and
3:03:58
really focusing on something with razor, you know, or laser accuracy.
3:04:05
Rather, he steps back and doesn’t sweat the details and looks for
3:04:10
these big, emerging patterns.
3:04:12
That’s what he does.
3:04:14
It’s been fun talking with Fred and it’s been helpful and insightful.
3:04:21
We’re pals.
3:04:22
We’ve spent at this point so much time
3:04:27
down in Southern Chile together and exploring those two volcanoes
3:04:31
together and that really has deepened our friendship and our understanding
3:04:39
of each other and volcanoes.
3:04:40
So, that’s been enormous taking the show on the road down to Patagonia.
3:04:47
Then, I’d say Jerry Franklin has been the fourth mentor.
3:04:53
Jerry probably because of his longstanding knowledge and interest in particularly
3:05:03
old-growth forests, but now more broadly
3:05:08
in just ecosystem sciences of the Northwest, including you know the
3:05:14
importance of disturbances, the importance of early seral communities.
3:05:22
His charismatic qualities to educate and to inform I have found
3:05:29
to be just really remarkable and deserving of tremendous respect.
3:05:37
So, those four people
3:05:42
have been incredibly important to me and then to a lesser degree some geologists,
3:05:50
such as Don Swanson [USGS], Richard Waitt, Jon Major, and Tom Pierson.
3:05:57
The latter two I’ve also had the privilege of working down
3:06:00
in Patagonia with those two.
3:06:02
They’re great.
3:06:03
Today I’ve worked more closely with Jon than any of them and
3:06:07
have a great working relationship with Jon today and he’s truly a
3:06:14
sharp, sharp scientist, astute scientist who is a wonderful geomorphologist
3:06:21
and is so focused on getting it right.
3:06:28
How would you compare what you’ve learned at St. Helens with your shorter
3:06:34
study span of the Chilean volcanoes?
3:06:38
You have samples up here, obviously, this is a serious subject.
3:06:43
How would you give a thumbnail sketch of comparisons and
3:06:48
analysis and conclusions that you could make at this point?
3:06:51
First of all, because southern Chile is a long ways away from, say, the
3:06:59
Portland International Airport, it
3:07:03
really limits the amount of time I can spend down there and because the
3:07:08
travel’s expensive and the work is remote and I don’t have a complete
3:07:13
staff of employees to help, I’ve been limited in the scope of what I can
3:07:19
undertake down in southern Chile.
3:07:21
That’s been a little frustrating, but there’s been so much to
3:07:24
do that that’s a fleeting
3:07:30
emotion.
3:07:33
I think that you know so down there I’ve had a focus on three things.
3:07:37
I’ve focused on plant community responses, essentially looking at the initial
3:07:45
impacts of disturbances on plants and early patterns of plant succession.
3:07:52
Second, I’ve been looking at ground-dwelling arthropods responses
3:07:58
to a range of different disturbance types a la Mount St. Helens at Chaitén
3:08:06
and at Caulle because we only looked at ashfall there, just he tephra piece.
3:08:09
Then the third is looking at the physical and chemical characteristics
3:08:16
of tephra, newly in place tephra and the buried former soil.
3:08:21
That’s the focus.
3:08:22
That is
3:08:24
a tiny, tiny sliver of what I do at Mount St. Helens.
3:08:30
Honestly, I’m not one of the primary plant ecologists at St. Helens.
3:08:35
It’s like there’s others that do that.
3:08:37
I work on all these other things.
3:08:40
Most of my plant work supports my animal studies via like habitat associations.
3:08:46
I do have some pure botanical plots up here, but it’s not the lion
3:08:51
share of my work by any stretch.
3:08:53
Down
3:08:55
there,
3:08:58
you know we’ve seen at Chaitén some of the same disturbance types but at very
3:09:05
different special scales and intensities.
3:09:09
Some of the lessons were clearly the disparity between gymnosperms
3:09:17
[conifers] at St. Helens and angiosperms down south and their ability to tolerate
3:09:22
heat and abrasion where the trees down in these broad-leaf evergreen
3:09:29
trees primarily in southern Chile resprout, even if they’re knocked
3:09:33
down by lateral blasts, pyroclastic density current, they resprout.
3:09:40
You have late successional species growing via sprouts immediately on the site.
3:09:45
So,
3:09:47
that’s different.
3:09:48
Up here the conifers, they’re really wimps, they do not resprout after
3:09:53
being heated at least to the extent that the 1980 eruption heated them.
3:10:02
That’s a difference.
3:10:05
The role of the wood on the ground provides similar functions in terms of
3:10:12
creating habitat for birds, for small mammals, for fungi, but what’s different
3:10:18
if the gymnosperms clearly have some anti or fungal-resistant characteristics.
3:10:26
The wood decay process between a northern and southern hemisphere is night and day.
3:10:31
Within two years of being down
3:10:39
on the ground level at Chaitén fungi had begun colonizing—wood
3:10:44
decomposers began colonizing.
3:10:46
By year three, the mycelia had ramified through the boles and by year four or five
3:10:54
they had consumed these massive diameter trees and they were already falling apart.
3:11:00
At St. Helens it took the gymnosperms 25 years to get to the
3:11:05
point of decomposition that the angiosperms were at in 3 or 4 years.
3:11:11
Big differences.
3:11:12
In terms of the early pioneers, almost ecological equivalence.
3:11:17
There’s this plant down there that’s like Pearly Everlasting or fireweed
3:11:22
[up here] , so these wind-disbursed herbs are quick to come in and they
3:11:26
can exploit the open areas that were formally forest overstory and shaded.
3:11:30
Now they’re sunlit and they can colonize those quickly.
3:11:34
The biggest—and then there’s another parallel of similarity here and that’s
3:11:42
that here the acacia shrubs, huckleberries and their allies grew quickly and
3:11:47
did in place of survivorship and preempted the site, occupied the light.
3:11:55
Down there, their understory species included a fuchsia shrub, a large,
3:12:03
large herbaceous plant called gunnera.
3:12:08
It has leaves that are easily 2 meters across.
3:12:11
Enormous plant.
3:12:14
So, gunnera took off as well as this very, very invasive and native bamboo
3:12:24
that grows vegetatively through rhizomes,
3:12:28
just vigorous grower.
3:12:29
Those species quickly spread and occluded the light at Chaitén.
3:12:38
We didn’t see that.
3:12:39
I mentioned there was a parallel but these aracacia shrubs up here grow so slow.
3:12:43
Plus, it’s high elevation.
3:12:44
Chaitén is sea level, 500 ft above sea level.
3:12:48
So, at Chaitén these three species that I just mentioned that were
3:12:54
there before the eruption and were survivors spread really quickly.
3:12:59
There was a little bit of inertia, but then by even year 4 or 5 they had grown
3:13:04
rapidly and altered the early pioneering community composition and abundance.
3:13:13
At St. Helens it was a much more protracted process.
3:13:16
Both the decay rates of wood and shifting of successional stage was much more
3:13:24
rapid at Chaitén than at St. Helens.
3:13:26
Sprouting was very different.
3:13:28
Pioneering species: red alder up here, a species down there.
3:13:33
But there were clear
3:13:36
parallels between these early successional trees coming in.
3:13:41
Insects quite similar.
3:13:43
We see insect herbivory was pronounced at
3:13:48
both sites, suggesting that herbivory is a common feature of these intensely
3:13:54
disturbed sites and that really hasn’t been well-documented in the literature.
3:13:59
I think that we should basically consider that to be a rule now.
3:14:04
When I’ve been up in a hardy ice field looking at retreating
3:14:06
glaciers in Alaska, when I was
3:14:10
at recent fires over in Idaho and in Wyoming, when I’ve been down to the
3:14:14
volcanoes and Chile, at St. Helens there appears to be a unifying theme
3:14:21
of herbivory being very important as these highly palatable forbs
3:14:26
and shrubs gaining prominence
3:14:31
in the post-disturbance environment.
3:14:37
So, would you still say, though, that there’s just not enough volcano ecology
3:14:44
in the world to fill out the data set and provide even more comparative
3:14:49
examples, because in the case of volcanoes, geology is still going to be
3:14:54
the default discipline, which is first, and then ecology would be second, even
3:14:59
with what St. Helens has taught us.
3:15:01
Being the most studied volcano in the history of the world.
3:15:06
Yeah, I think from an ecological perspective, but, from both
3:15:10
geological and ecological, Mount St. Helens is the most well-studied.
3:15:14
I think that, yes, I mean, so what I’ve been doing for the past two years
3:15:20
with my employees, Fred has helped a little bit, but this has been pretty
3:15:24
much my employees and I we have
3:15:28
been developing a global database on volcano ecology.
3:15:34
We have been trying to locate every single paper published on volcanoes
3:15:39
in response to volcano disturbances.
3:15:41
Not like some study of meadows of Mount Rainier that hasn’t
3:15:44
erupted in 1,000 years.
3:15:45
This is post-eruption volcano ecology.
3:15:49
We’ve gone through and we’ve classified every one of these papers by the
3:15:55
disturbance types that occurred there, the taxas studied, the timeframe that they
3:16:02
were studied, and other characteristics.
3:16:04
Now we’re able to look at things like, okay, and then we assign
3:16:09
them to biomes of the world.
3:16:11
We’re able to say what is the distribution of volcanoes that have erupted
3:16:17
since some period around the world.
3:16:19
Okay, well, what percentage of them have been studied by ecologists?
3:16:24
What percentage of those have been studied by, have had spider studies?
3:16:30
Versus mammal studies?
3:16:32
Versus marine studies?
3:16:34
Versus bird studies?
3:16:36
We can even ask the question how many have been disturbed by tephra?
3:16:43
How many studies of birds have happened in response to tephra fall
3:16:50
and published from 1970 to 1980?
3:16:55
It’s this incredibly powerful—we’ve been working on it for over two years.
3:17:01
Some wonderful things have emerged from those patterns.
3:17:03
One thing for sure is that right off the bat is that only about, well, about
3:17:14
15%, maybe 16 or 17% of volcanoes that have erupted since the big eruption
3:17:19
of Krakatoa in 1883 have erupted have been studied by ecologists.
3:17:24
Most of those have had cursory levels of inquiry.
3:17:30
That is to say that they haven’t had, it’s been a short-term study or limited
3:17:36
in terms of the disturbance type studied or the taxa studied, so duration, taxa,
3:17:42
or system types have been limited.
3:17:46
Only three have had long-term, committed study across many
3:17:51
different taxonomic groups.
3:17:52
Now, what are those three?
3:17:53
Those three are the three iconic ones, initially the 1883 eruption of
3:17:57
Krakatoa, the 1964 emergence [from the north Atlantic] of Surtsey, and
3:18:02
the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.
3:18:05
Those three alone account for roughly 70% of all published
3:18:12
material in volcano ecology.
3:18:14
And three completely different climate zones as well as—
3:18:18
Exactly so—
3:18:19
Typology so there’s not the comparative analogies would be,
3:18:23
well, you could make them but—
3:18:26
With the caveat that
3:18:29
growing seasons and many other things are incredibly different.
3:18:31
Oceanic
3:18:34
settings: two are in oceanic settings.
3:18:36
One north Atlantic, the other equatorial.
3:18:39
St. Helens: temperate, coastal continental.
3:18:41
Right.
3:18:43
There’s differences.
3:18:46
What emerged is that the west coast of the Americas, which is
3:18:51
the only place with volcanoes in the Americas, are well-studied.
3:18:55
This is relative, including out way to the Aleutians.
3:18:59
The Aleutians and north, central, and south America have been well-studied
3:19:09
and New Zealand is well-studied.
3:19:14
Japan is well-studied.
3:19:15
In other words, the developed countries more or less.
3:19:18
Right.
3:19:19
Places that are way understudied include Indonesia, Kamchatka, and in
3:19:30
Kurils.
3:19:30
Africa has amazing volcanoes.
3:19:32
There’s not a single paper we could find published on volcano
3:19:37
ecology of the African continent.
3:19:41
So,
3:19:44
far eastern Pacific,
3:19:48
Indonesia, and Africa are the places.
3:19:52
This analysis we’re doing can actually create an agenda for
3:19:57
ecologists to start filling in the matrix of places that need study.
3:20:03
You know, that’s how academics work, too.
3:20:06
They say, okay, where has not been studied.
3:20:09
Hopefully people start, well, okay here’s a spot on the map.
3:20:14
Here’s a place to make an original imprint, right?
3:20:16
Or we make a pitch for it.
3:20:18
Maybe we say if one of the African volcanoes pops off and it’s not
3:20:24
in a place of civil unrest, that
3:20:29
we can now make the case and so, you know, obviously, Fred is I
3:20:35
would say, not to diss him here, but he’s well into his career.
3:20:39
I don’t think he’s looking to go galavanting across the
3:20:41
world starting volcano studies.
3:20:43
Like he’s hot to go down to Calbuco, Chile, and continue some work down there
3:20:49
for sure, but we need young people.
3:20:51
The same thing with me.
3:20:52
I mean, I’m, Fred’s ahead of me, but I’m also to the point that,
3:20:58
yeah, in the next few years I’d be willing to do something along these
3:21:01
lines, but we need the next cohort.
3:21:04
In any case, this whole volcano ecology thing has been interesting.
3:21:08
There are some interesting parallels that could be made between the
3:21:16
Chilean Patagonia volcanoes and Mount St. Helens because of two reasons.
3:21:20
One, they’re both temperate rain forests.
3:21:23
They’re coastal Pacific, each with big, expansive
3:21:29
semi-arid environments to the east on the rain shadow side.
3:21:32
The Patagonian steppe and the Columbia Plateau steppe.
3:21:38
They’re deeply dissected mountain environments with
3:21:42
stratovolcanoes punctuating them.
3:21:45
Both heavy precipitation and cool, moist air masses.
3:21:50
There are great parallels between the two and we see lots of
3:21:54
similarities with some differences.
3:21:55
Most of the differences tend to be tied to nuances of the biota rather than to the
3:22:04
disturbances themselves.
3:22:05
Some of the underlying ecological processes seem to be quite similar.
3:22:10
Differences we see tend to be tied to specific aspects of the biota.
3:22:15
The overall dynamics have more similarities than not?
3:22:18
Yeah.
3:22:19
Like amphibians.
3:22:20
Amphibians at both Chaitén and St. Helens came back gangbusters in the blast area.
3:22:24
Not what you would anticipate, right?
3:22:27
Amphibians are well-known for being highly sensitive to environmental
3:22:32
perturbation, environmental change and that habitat destruction has been viewed
3:22:37
as one of the primary, but certainly not the only drivers of their plight
3:22:44
and leveling of temperature rainforests in either hemisphere could constitute
3:22:53
by some radical habitat change, yet the amphibians have done quite well.
3:22:59
I think most of the amphibian habitat alteration work that people have looked
3:23:03
at things where people are bulldozing streams or altering wetlands, which
3:23:08
are fundamentally a different beast than volcanic eruptions, but it’s very
3:23:12
interesting to see the similarities of very different, different families,
3:23:17
different assemblages of amphibians, but they’ve behaved essentially
3:23:23
identically.
3:23:25
Going to local communities, I wanted to talk about that some.
3:23:30
You’ve been a member of this community for a long time and you know the
3:23:35
communities around the mountain.
3:23:37
Uh-huh.
3:23:41
What do you remember about your interactions with people in the local
3:23:47
communities in the ‘80s, in the immediate aftermath about this and how they looked
3:23:53
at the mountain and what happened?
3:23:56
Well, it was mixed.
3:23:58
Keep in mind in immediate aftermath and even extending for an entire, more than
3:24:04
a decade, almost for 15 years, this region was embroiled over the old-growth
3:24:14
logging versus forest preservation.
3:24:16
If
3:24:19
you were even associated and most of these communities, including the one I’m living
3:24:24
in, were timber dependent communities.
3:24:28
If you worked for the Forest Service, it didn’t matter if you
3:24:31
were a research biologist and had nothing to do with the timber sale
3:24:33
plan, you were studying gophers out of the volcano, it didn’t matter.
3:24:37
You were targeted.
3:24:38
You were targeted with hostility.
3:24:44
You didn’t go into the local taverns.
3:24:47
A fight would ensue.
3:24:48
You’d get knocked out.
3:24:52
Those were really tense times as the communities were embroiled
3:24:59
in this tension over how the National Forest should be managed.
3:25:03
You would include Cougar,
3:25:09
Toutle, all the—
3:25:10
Surrounding communities.
3:25:12
Particularly Amboy was bad.
3:25:13
Oh, really?
3:25:14
Yeah.
3:25:15
And Randle,
3:25:17
Randle was bad.
3:25:19
In any case, that worked its way out.
3:25:23
There were some terrible growing pains, but people realized they
3:25:27
weren’t going back to the days of cutting an umpteen board feet of
3:25:32
timber off the National Forest.
3:25:33
The Northwest Forest Plan was squarely in place and these were times of tremendous
3:25:40
growing pains and the communities evolved.
3:25:44
Some people went away and others came in, and new ways of earning income
3:25:53
happened, and, so since that time, the dominant prevailing view is that Mount
3:26:04
St. Helens is really cool, and we are really lucky that we have this national,
3:26:13
international gem in our backyard.
3:26:16
You think even the hardcore conservative redneck types?
3:26:21
No, that’s why I said the overwhelming view.
3:26:26
This gets back to the vocal,
3:26:31
the, sorry, the vocal minority.
3:26:38
Then there’s this vocal minority still to this day.
3:26:41
Still, okay.
3:26:42
Think that the Forest Service is doing a bum job of managing the
3:26:47
Monument, that they want to go back, and they want to swim in Spirit Lake.
3:26:51
They want to fish in Spirit Lake.
3:26:52
They want to ride their ATVs wherever they want to.
3:26:54
They want to ride their horses wherever they want to.
3:26:56
They want to be able to shoot elk wherever they want to, and that
3:26:59
uncle is keeping them out of their forest, their National Forest.
3:27:04
They’ve never fully accepted the fact that things changed in 1980
3:27:11
and we’re never going to go back to the same and they can’t get over it.
3:27:14
By God, their grandparents and parents took them swimming
3:27:20
in Spirit Lake, finished in Spirit Lake and took them here and took
3:27:26
them there and it’s their God given right to continue that.
3:27:29
They’re having a hard time.
3:27:30
But it’s a vocal minority.
3:27:32
It’s a handful.
3:27:34
People,
3:27:38
many, most of the locals
3:27:44
believe that the 1980 eruption was a fascinating phenomenon that happened and
3:27:53
they feel privileged that it happened in their backyard during their lifetime
3:27:57
and that they experienced that event.
3:28:01
I think that, if you move more out of the local communities and go to
3:28:05
the larger regional metropolitan areas, that only becomes more so.
3:28:14
So, how has the timber economy recovered or re-found a
3:28:19
newer, lower level in general?
3:28:23
You could ask that question anywhere across the west,
3:28:25
but in this particular area.
3:28:27
I mean, you’ve got all the Weyerhaeuser land and then
3:28:30
you’ve got National Forest Land.
3:28:31
First of all,
3:28:35
I can speak fluently on the ecology of Mount St. Helens.
3:28:38
This is getting far afield for me, but my impression is that the forest we’re
3:28:45
not putting much timber up for sale and those timber sales that were going up
3:28:54
for sale involved thinning of natural,
3:29:01
regenerated natural fire-regenerated stands.
3:29:04
So, they’re 100-year-old stands that burns around on the Gifford Pinchot.
3:29:12
The industry was either, because of the value of the timber at that time
3:29:22
or because of this different view of not having regeneration harvest
3:29:26
clear-cuts and because this was smaller material—the diameter of these trees.
3:29:33
It wasn’t old growth.
3:29:33
These are 100-year-old trees or less, that
3:29:37
there wasn’t a real interest.
3:29:39
I don’t know how much of that was market forces or how much of that was just the
3:29:43
system which had been doing something for a long time in a certain way not having
3:29:48
the plasticity to react and change.
3:29:53
I remember talking to many frustrated interdisciplinary team members.
3:29:59
These groups that the Forest Services convened to put forth a timber sale
3:30:03
analysis, or to conduct a timber sale analysis and put forth a sale
3:30:08
if it gets through the analysis okay
3:30:13
and just say, oh my God, we just worked how many months on
3:30:16
this and nobody’s bidding it.
3:30:19
There was this real lull.
3:30:22
Now I’m seeing timber, you know, logging trucks roll off the National
3:30:26
Forest in other lands on a regular basis and there are active timber
3:30:31
sales in the Gifford Pinchot.
3:30:32
There’s two going on right now between here and Mount St. Helens.
3:30:35
There’s an uptick.
3:30:36
But that’s about all I can say to that topic.
3:30:41
There are far more knowledgeable people.
3:30:44
No, but still it’s part of your knowledge base, since
3:30:47
you’ve been a community member.
3:30:49
One of the most important things for the ecology of the Mount
3:30:53
St. Helens area is the fact that
3:30:59
you know part of the blast area, or the blast area included areas that
3:31:04
were in the Monument and areas that were outside of the Monument that
3:31:09
were salvage logged and replanted.
3:31:10
It happened on Forest Service land.
3:31:13
Most notably Clearwater valley and the upper Green.
3:31:16
It happened on DNR land [State of Washington Department of Natural
3:31:18
Resources] , most notably west of Studebaker Ridge and North Fork Toutle
3:31:24
and South Fork Toutle basins and then Weyerhaeuser land, north of Toutle
3:31:32
into the Green River and beyond.
3:31:34
What’s happened is that early on, you know, from an ecological point of view,
3:31:39
the salvaging, logging the salvaged areas didn’t seem all that different.
3:31:46
Obviously, the wood was missing, but fireweed was the dominant
3:31:51
herb and it covered the landscape.
3:31:53
But what happened is, eventually, meaning about 6, 8 years after planting,
3:31:58
these conifers really took off and then they achieved canopy cover.
3:32:04
When that happened, that was a game changer.
3:32:08
Right now, particularly for wide-ranging species like elk, the Monument has
3:32:15
become, excuse me, the blast area has become a very different place in terms
3:32:20
of the habitat suitability due to light occlusion from the closing of canopies in
3:32:27
the plantations and a reduction of forage.
3:32:31
What that means is not only does the overall carrying capacity decline, but
3:32:37
so many of those hungry elk now shift out to the Monument where we’re supposed to
3:32:41
allow the ecological processes to proceed substantially unimpeded, yet we have high
3:32:46
elk carrying capacity during the summer knocking the hell out of the vegetation.
3:32:50
Which is why you have so many elk down in the debris avalanche area, the
3:32:53
open area down by the Toutle, right?
3:32:55
Well, and also because they feed them down there.
3:32:56
To even complicate matters down there, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the
3:33:02
Washington Department of Wildlife created, bought a bunch of land
3:33:05
in the lower Toutle outside of the Monument and created winter ranges,
3:33:08
seeded, on the mud flow deposit area.
3:33:11
During the winter, they’re bolstering the populations.
3:33:14
Not only do they create the winter range, but on bad winters they’ve
3:33:17
actually been feeding the elk.
3:33:22
All of these things conspire to create challenges for managing wide-ranging
3:33:30
species across multiple ownerships, each with different management objectives.
3:33:39
Complex.
3:33:41
Yeah.
3:33:43
Along that lines [up questions about] multi-institutional and different
3:33:48
agencies, what has been the biggest challenge from your perspective about
3:33:55
keeping a collaborative dynamic of research at St. Helens going and
3:34:02
being, what’s the word I’m looking for?
3:34:06
Being reciprocal or a positive relationship between them?
3:34:13
Has there ever been a problem with too much stuff going
3:34:15
on, not enough communication?
3:34:17
Do you understand what I’m saying?
3:34:20
Yeah, there hasn’t been—as far as I’m concerned there’s not been turf wars.
3:34:25
That’s one of the big, unfortunate aspects.
3:34:29
I’ve talked to a number of people that said oh, we figured that everything was
3:34:33
being studied at Mount St. Helens or that people had laid claim to certain
3:34:38
areas or certain subject areas and that there wasn’t any real estate left.
3:34:45
That is so far from the truth.
3:34:48
That was one piece, but in terms of the people working here I mean you’re dealing
3:34:53
with—the potential is large because you're’ largely dealing with academics
3:35:01
and many of whom have big egos overall.
3:35:06
But, let me say that, well, having said that we haven’t had issues to speak of.
3:35:14
I mean, I think generally, this group has gotten along very well.
3:35:20
They’ve been respectful to one another and there’s been some
3:35:25
really meaningful and important collaborations that have been forged.
3:35:31
On the other hand, there’ are clearly people who are just the lone wolf and
3:35:35
they prefer to be off marching to the beat of their own drummer, but they
3:35:39
do it in a non-controversial way and they’re super productive and they’ve
3:35:43
been a huge asset to the community.
3:35:46
This is not a place where wells have been poisoned.
3:35:51
This is a place that I think largely is a goodwill and has been [a model] of
3:35:57
sharing and openness and honest dialogue.
3:36:04
How do you deal with talking about egos, PhDs, academics, which is true
3:36:11
in some cases—now, you came in here as an undergraduate and in my opinion,
3:36:19
you possess a PhD many times over in experience and knowledge of this place.
3:36:26
How do you deal with people who have the card-carrying PhDs versus you who
3:36:31
has serious credentials and publication history, but you don’t have the
3:36:38
PhD? I’m just curious—
3:36:38
First of all, I would say that if I ever had any misgivings during my
3:36:43
career, it was that I didn’t take advantage of going to graduate school
3:36:52
and earning a Ph.D. I had offers.
3:36:54
I had offers with Chuck Hawkins, Jim MacMahon, Peter Kareiva.
3:37:00
A number of people asked me if I would work with them on a Ph.D. and I didn’t
3:37:04
do it because I was earning a salary and I had a young child and was paying a
3:37:08
mortgage and hunkered down with my wife and doing our thing and was like, “Wow.
3:37:15
This is great.
3:37:15
I get to do all these things.” I didn’t do it.
3:37:18
I took 8 years of graduate coursework at Utah State, winters,
3:37:22
free for non-matriculated.
3:37:24
I felt like I was learning that stuff I wanted to learn the material.
3:37:28
In any case, but I feel like to this day it was not the right decision.
3:37:35
It did not serve me well not to do it.
3:37:37
I should have done it.
3:37:39
But it got to a point
3:37:42
to where I wasn’t going to do it.
3:37:46
At some point, I got to a certain age and I’m like I’m not going to do that now.
3:37:51
But throughout my career there’s always been these uncomfortable times.
3:37:56
Rarely are they from individuals.
3:37:59
It’s more an awkward situation when I’m introduced at a
3:38:05
conference as Dr. Crisafulli.
3:38:07
And you’re not.
3:38:08
And I’m not.
3:38:09
Or, what did you did your Ph.D. on?
3:38:15
And I didn’t.
3:38:17
Because everybody just expects it.
3:38:20
Honestly if somebody introduces me at a conference or if they’ve come to Mount St.
3:38:25
Helens with their class and they say class Charlie Crisafulli is leading us today.
3:38:30
We’re very privileged to have Charlie because of blah, blah, blah, he’s
3:38:33
familiar with Mount St. Helens, so my pleasure to introduce Dr. Crisafulli.
3:38:38
I do not say, by the way so-and-so, I don’t have—I just let it go.
3:38:43
It’s too awkward, yeah.
3:38:44
And all the mail that shows up—Dr.
3:38:46
Crisafulli.
3:38:46
I don’t write those people back, sorry, it’s Mr. Crisafulli.
3:38:51
Those have been the awkward things.
3:38:53
Book chapters.
3:38:54
Manuscripts.
3:38:56
It’s like list your highest level of education.
3:39:00
And so, you know, I have to put what it is.
3:39:05
It has been the single most uncomfortable part of my career is
3:39:10
dealing with the ivory tower crowd.
3:39:12
Fortunately, there’s only been one person at Mount St. Helens that has been less
3:39:18
than friendly about that and I would say at times really that was so unnecessary.
3:39:27
I haven’t gotten that.
3:39:28
I have been dealt with in I think a very respectful way.
3:39:32
If I were to do it all over again, I would go get a Ph.D.
3:39:35
But you know what, Charlie, if you had done that you would have
3:39:38
never been here all these years.
3:39:40
You would have been at a university for a good part of your career.
3:39:45
So, then the next point, you’re right, is that is I say to myself, if, and
3:39:51
excuse me if this is just ridiculous, but
3:39:56
if a person is called a carpenter and everybody says, yeah, and you
3:40:03
know he’s trained as a carpenter.
3:40:04
You go to carpentry school, you go to trade school, and you’re
3:40:07
trained as a master carpentry.
3:40:08
Cabinet builder.
3:40:09
Whatever.
3:40:10
But every single day for 35 years instead of picking up a saw, a square
3:40:19
and a hammer you pick up a trowel,
3:40:28
all your masonry tools and instead of working with wood you work with rock
3:40:33
and you work with bricks and you work with block, and you’re mixing concrete
3:40:37
cement and you’re building fireplaces and rock walls and water features out of
3:40:43
rock only a fool, only a fool after 35 years would call that person a carpenter.
3:41:00
At what point, how many years do you have to work side-by-side with PhDs?
3:41:06
How many times do you have to
3:41:11
work at a level that people have said you know you work
3:41:13
at or above a level with PhDs?
3:41:15
You have published.
3:41:16
You have bought in grants.
3:41:19
At what point, well, is it just well I’m sorry, it’s just academic?
3:41:24
In
3:41:29
any case, I haven’t looked back.
3:41:31
It’s caused me pause on many occasions and because my world is in some ways
3:41:41
kind of small, I do a lot at St. Helens.
3:41:47
I went to trips in China.
3:41:49
The Chinese Academy of Science has paid my entire trip.
3:41:52
Dr. Crisafulli to come to China.
3:41:55
I presented at symposia and fieldtrips and seminars and
3:42:00
it was like that’s what it is.
3:42:02
In any case, it hasn’t encumbered me, and I don’t feel as though I’m doing
3:42:07
my job under false pretenses, but it’s created awkward situations and more
3:42:12
often than not I just let it flow.
3:42:14
I mean, Charlie, I listen to you and I hear brilliance and commitment.
3:42:20
Well, commitment to a fault.
3:42:21
No,
3:42:24
I’m not trying to polish your apple.
3:42:27
I’m given you an authentic compliment.
3:42:30
Well, thank you.
3:42:30
About what I hear and see and, like I said, if you’ve gotten in the
3:42:35
ivory tower, you’ve never would been able to do what you’ve done here.
3:42:38
Well, thank you.
3:42:39
For me, this has been driven by passion, passion for knowledge, passion for
3:42:47
ecology, passion for trying to satisfy or entertain my curiosity and that’s
3:42:54
what’s been motivating me all along.
3:42:57
In some ways, it’s been a bit selfish.
3:43:00
I mean a lot of this has been about me, about me wanting to understand
3:43:05
this place that’s so damn fascinating and there’s so much to learn and I
3:43:10
get to do that while I get to train scores of undergraduate co-advisements.
3:43:16
At this point, I don’t have a graduate degree, yet I’ve
3:43:19
co-advised two Ph.D. students and two handfuls of masters students.
3:43:25
That’s been a huge highlight working with the graduate
3:43:28
students and the undergraduates.
3:43:32
It’s been a great ride and not a single regret.
3:43:41
In general, how would you characterize the science as having
3:43:45
changed and in what way since 1980?
3:43:48
I’m referencing the technology paradigm shifts in ecology, geology.
3:43:55
How would you draw a sketch of that dynamic, that evolution over 35 years?
3:44:00
I think the single most conspicuous change has been a reduction in the
3:44:11
emphasis on studying organisms.
3:44:14
I think generally I mean students used to come out of school with mammalogy,
3:44:22
botany, zoology, ornithology, ichthyology,
3:44:28
herpetology, etc. Training.
3:44:32
That became somewhat, and there used to be those departments: the
3:44:35
department of biological science, the department of zoology, of
3:44:38
botany and obviously still exist.
3:44:40
But I think the scope has changed from that organismal approach to
3:44:49
the large and the small and so many, many of the applicants for
3:44:54
the positions I advertise each year.
3:44:58
For your seasonal group?
3:44:59
For my seasonal have molecular techniques experience, so they know how to run gels.
3:45:07
They know how to extract DNA
3:45:12
and in other molecular techniques.
3:45:18
They amplify DNA, for example, or they can run rapids or any number of molecular
3:45:23
techniques, many of them, or they have GIS and perhaps remote sensing, and so
3:45:30
what’s really interesting is many of the students, and presumably because it’s
3:45:35
being emphasized in school or because it’s a driving force in the job market have
3:45:41
molecular techniques or have these huge special analyses techniques and these are
3:45:48
equal, but opposite in terms of the scale.
3:45:51
So,
3:45:54
either the level of biological organization or just the spatial scale
3:45:59
in which things are being viewed, and so I think there’s been a dearth
3:46:08
of people being trained as good, solid ecologists.
3:46:12
Having said that, I’ve been able to—it’s not like I haven’t been able to find
3:46:18
qualified candidates every single year, but, if I look at the whole
3:46:23
pool of applicants, there does not seem to be as many as there once was.
3:46:31
That’s one thing that’s changed.
3:46:32
Do you think people are being over-trained in their specialty?
3:46:39
To some extent.
3:46:40
So, there’s difference of
3:46:44
the training: molecular and broad-scale versus organismal.
3:46:48
The second is the emphasis on modeling.
3:46:52
Empirical data, gathering empirical data, although it
3:46:56
obviously still happens seems to be
3:47:04
possibly slipping but more importantly the whole notion of modeling, if
3:47:09
you’re not modeling, something it just doesn’t quite have the validity.
3:47:15
There seems to be this real emphasis on genetics, a real emphasis on
3:47:19
modeling and multi-variate statistics.
3:47:22
I
3:47:25
think a lot of the students, particularly graduate students, are
3:47:29
being over-trained in analytical methods.
3:47:34
A lot of people would buck and say oh my God, you’re such an
3:47:36
old-school natural historian.
3:47:38
But there is such a thing as over-analyzing data.
3:47:42
Well, they call it a paralysis through analysis.
3:47:46
Yeah.
3:47:47
You can talk about
3:47:50
modeling?
3:47:50
In any case, I think models are useful.
3:47:56
I should say, all models poorly reflect the world, is probably
3:48:03
true, and some models are useful.
3:48:08
We need to be careful how to exercise those.
3:48:12
Every graduate student, even undergrads now, they’re all trained in R, right.
3:48:15
They need to learn R code.
3:48:17
They need to learn modeling techniques and many different modeling techniques
3:48:21
and I don’t think that’s necessarily bad, but I’m concerned with the field of
3:48:26
ecology becoming a little too abstract and not grounded in basic natural history
3:48:32
and basic field ecology, because you can model until the cows come home, but,
3:48:36
if you don’t know the target organism, you’re becoming less and less in tune
3:48:41
with the very thing that you’re studying.
3:48:43
There’s always going to be room for theoretical ecologists and biologists.
3:48:48
God love them.
3:48:48
They play an important role.
3:48:51
I feel like almost a norm now is to have everybody spending a little bit too much
3:48:56
time modeling and becoming maybe just a little too proficient in analyses.
3:49:05
Another change that I’ve noticed between say 1980 and contemporary times from
3:49:10
2015 or even back five years or 2010 or perhaps earlier is that many of
3:49:20
the investigators and certainly many of the graduate students are really
3:49:26
sophisticated in their line of inquiry and they’re looking beyond the narrow
3:49:35
focus of any particular taxonomic group, but instead are really looking for
3:49:45
relationships among different organisms, among organisms in an environment.
3:49:50
I know that’s just ecology, but in practice it wasn’t always that way.
3:49:54
Some people just studied amphibians or just studied fishes
3:49:57
or just studied this or that.
3:49:59
Now, at least the students and many of the investigators I’m working
3:50:03
with at Mount St. Helens are really digging deep to look for underlying
3:50:09
relationships and causal factors that would lend credence to explaining they
3:50:16
patterns they see emerging across the changing landscape at Mount St. Helens.
3:50:20
So, they’re thinking holistically and ecologically outside of
3:50:24
whatever their specific training has trained them to think about, right?
3:50:27
Right.
3:50:28
A student interested in the effects of willow herbivory by the
3:50:35
willow stem-boring beetle, may be now looking at ecophysiology through
3:50:42
photosynthetic efficiency or water use efficiency, leaf water potential.
3:50:50
They may also be looking at nutrient cycling.
3:50:54
They may be looking at attack rate infrequency and they may be looking at
3:51:00
differences between water availability and those factors and gender of the
3:51:07
plant, will it be male or female.
3:51:09
All of these things at integrating these into one or several sub
3:51:18
levels of inquiry that builds a much more comprehensive and much
3:51:22
more holistic understanding.
3:51:23
They’re very sophisticated.
3:51:25
It requires a great deal of training.
3:51:27
I’ve been really impressed by some of the work that’s been done that takes that
3:51:33
more holistic and integrated approach.
3:51:44
If you were going to forecast the next 35 years or 30 years, how would you, what
3:51:52
would you think say that Mount St. Helens ecology would look like in 30, 35 years?
3:51:56
What do you think will be the major changes or continuations of the same
3:52:02
or how would you pre-masticate that?
3:52:04
Of the research or the systems?
3:52:07
Of the systems.
3:52:08
The systems are going to change a lot.
3:52:10
I think that there’s going to be some very non-linear change.
3:52:16
I think there are going to be cusp events that usher in or trigger major changes
3:52:22
and that we will continue in much of landscape to accrual species, we’ll
3:52:30
continue to fill in and we’ll continue to increase biodiversity, say richness
3:52:36
values per unit areas, species richness.
3:52:40
Then we’re going to start hitting thresholds.
3:52:42
Actually, even in the next 5 or 10 years, where we’re going to see these
3:52:46
areas that were quick out of the gate to change – to go into a condition of
3:52:54
high canopy cover, dense vegetation, and they’re going to be game changers.
3:52:58
That’s going to be the single most important factor that drives the
3:53:02
ecological condition of the landscape is the presence of woody vegetation.
3:53:10
Shrubs.
3:53:10
It’s already happening throughout much of the blast area right now and
3:53:18
much less so in parts of the debris avalanche, essentially non-existent
3:53:23
on the Pumice Plain to any degree relative to the other sites,
3:53:28
except for down by Spirit Lake.
3:53:31
In any case, the big change will be a shift in the plant life form, that
3:53:37
is the physiognomy, and I expect that
3:53:43
initially the shrubs are going to be game changers.
3:53:46
They’ll change things by changing the light regime.
3:53:49
All the sun-loving plants that have been so dominant for so long are going
3:53:54
to find relatively inhospitable or less-hospitable growing conditions
3:54:01
and they’re going to wane.
3:54:02
As the canopy gets larger of various species.
3:54:04
Darker, as it shifts.
3:54:05
So, you’re going to see changes in microclimate.
3:54:07
It’s going to be moister.
3:54:08
It’s going to have higher relative humidity, greater
3:54:11
moisture retention, and sunlight.
3:54:13
That’s going to cause a reduction in the sun-loving vegetation and a slow [and
3:54:18
it could be fairly rapid] and a slow increase in shade tolerance species.
3:54:24
Because they have the problem of getting there, dispersal limitations.
3:54:28
But I think that the, and the shrubs are going to usher in a whole new group
3:54:32
of birds and small mammals and insects.
3:54:34
It’s already underway.
3:54:35
That
3:54:37
is a
3:54:40
very important factor right now and it’s only going to increase through time.
3:54:46
Because the landscape that was disturbed was so large and it’s so variable
3:54:51
in terms of the initial conditions and subsequent processes of erosion
3:54:55
and secondary disturbances of other forms and establishment conditions
3:55:01
that there’s a lot of heterogeneity.
3:55:03
It’s still going to be a protracted place.
3:55:06
Thirty-five years out there’s going to be places on the Pumice
3:55:09
Plain and debris avalanche that are probably going to be quite similar
3:55:13
to places in the blast area now.
3:55:15
This offers you know a multi-decadal opportunity for early seral species
3:55:21
in this complex matrix of this slowly regenerating landscape.
3:55:26
I think that the next game-changing event will be the dominance of trees.
3:55:35
There are going to be places in the landscape that go into
3:55:37
deciduous trees, namely red alder.
3:55:40
Other places that are going to go into conifers, mixed conifers.
3:55:44
Red alder’s down in the debris avalanche and in certain riparian areas?
3:55:50
Exactly.
3:55:56
It’ll
3:55:59
be a big difference between trees versus shrubs and a huge difference
3:56:03
between conifers versus deciduous trees.
3:56:06
This is all going to unfold.
3:56:09
Places like the Pumice Plain where conifers are getting established in fairly
3:56:15
good numbers and mixed species it’s going to be this very much a parkland type
3:56:22
environment where you’re going to have
3:56:26
conifers emerging from a dense shrub understory and patches that are
3:56:33
kept open by disturbance, primarily along the riparian areas because
3:56:37
the streams are far from stable.
3:56:39
In any case, I think that within the next 5 years we’re going to see a local site
3:56:47
basis, areas that are turning the corner and actually start declining in diversity.
3:56:55
They’ve reached an apex and we’re going to see other areas [SS interrupts CC]
3:56:58
. But biomass will increase but diversity will decrease, right?
3:57:02
Yeah, you’re going to have a net increase in standing crop in all
3:57:08
likelihood but a change in community structure of everything from
3:57:16
arthropods to mammals and you know we already see it.
3:57:19
If you look at the places that have gone into shrub patches,
3:57:23
even on the Pumice Plain.
3:57:25
You look at the pitfall trap samples, they’re dominated by detritivores
3:57:30
and species like millipedes
3:57:35
where immediately adjacent to that is still carabid beetles
3:57:38
and orthopteras, grasshoppers.
3:57:42
Even at a fine scale, that’s why Mount St. Helens just really offers this
3:57:50
opportunity for patch dynamics, but I think what we really need to be doing is
3:57:54
not only looking at the patch dynamics, but looking at this broad landscape
3:57:59
evolution and that’s something that’s gotten very little attention by ecologists
3:58:04
and ought to be on a research agenda.
3:58:08
But the landscape ecology has been a recognized field for 20, 25 years now.
3:58:13
People just haven’t tested those ideas or measured it at
3:58:16
Mount St. Helens to speak of.
3:58:18
Rick Lawrence did a little bit but that’s about it.
3:58:20
Right.
3:58:22
In any case, I think that the landscape will continue to be dynamic and there
3:58:28
are going to be places that start seeing a reduction and other places
3:58:33
that continue to see an increase and that, in the absence of disturbance, the
3:58:39
overall landscape is going to become more homogenous and so will the communities.
3:58:48
I heard somebody at the Pulse say something about in 100 years
3:58:52
this will look like it used to look, which I disagree with.
3:58:57
How long would it take to look like it used to with the exception
3:59:00
of the big hole in the mountain?
3:59:04
Given that [SS interrupts]
3:59:06
. A hundred years or is that too short?
3:59:07
No!
3:59:07
Given that many of the trees were 300 and 400 years old [SS talks over CC]
3:59:10
. That’s what I mean, yeah.
3:59:11
It’s going to be hundreds of years.
3:59:13
Yeah.
3:59:14
I mean you need to define just like before, I mean the species mix is
3:59:19
probably going to be different.
3:59:21
Over the whole area it will be tending towards a similar
3:59:26
condition, but still centuries away.
3:59:29
Right.
3:59:29
In any specific area it may never resemble very closely the community structure
3:59:37
because of just change events and history.
3:59:40
Well, Spirit Lake will never look like it once did.
3:59:43
Well, right, there are places in the landscape that are new
3:59:47
landforms, so all bets are off.
3:59:53
There’s no sense in even trying to frame it in a recovery sense.
3:59:57
It’s a new place.
3:59:58
No, I know.
3:59:59
I mean, we use these words casually, like recovery and I remember
4:00:02
Jerry Franklin talking to me about well, recovering from what?
4:00:05
Because it’s new in many ways.
4:00:09
You need to define what recovery is.
4:00:12
If you want to say recovery of Spirit Lake, and we’re going to define
4:00:16
recovery based on having chemical and physical properties similar to
4:00:22
the pre-eruption conditions, well if you define it that way, sure.
4:00:26
You can do it.
4:00:29
Then, it’s okay.
4:00:31
It’s all about the devil’s in the details in how you want
4:00:34
to define what recovery is.
4:00:37
Regardless, back to the main point is that and there may be
4:00:43
some wild cards along the way.
4:00:44
Mount St. Helens has been full of these boom-and-bust cycles, but I expect
4:00:48
that these boom-and-bust cycles will also wane and they will be dampened
4:00:52
and oscillated through time as species interaction strengths increase and these
4:00:59
interactions become, species become more tightly coupled so they don’t have
4:01:03
the possibility to go through these wildly fluctuating boom-and-bust cycles.
4:01:08
This gets back to what I call the three P’s: predators, parasites, and pathogens.
4:01:13
That if you have an area recent diminuted by a disturbance, such as the 1980
4:01:17
eruption of Mount St. Helens or even greatly reduced in terms of the vegetation
4:01:22
richness and volume abundance, that this affords opportunities for some species
4:01:29
to flourish, because, if they get there there’s a chance or some other force
4:01:36
get there and they can exploit the resources, then their populations can
4:01:41
really flourish and in the absence of predator, parasite, or pathogen they go
4:01:48
unchecked to continue until they either exploit the resource their utilizing
4:01:55
or one of the three P’s finds them and then their population goes gangbusters
4:02:00
because they have this unlimited resource.
4:02:04
We’ve seen these boom-and-bust cycles play out through space and time as if it’s a
4:02:10
rule in these early successional systems.
4:02:14
As more players, species, colonize and as the intervening spaces fill in, these
4:02:22
interactions should become more rightly coupled, reducing the frequency and
4:02:30
magnitude of the boom and bust cycles.
4:02:34
So, it will be a dampening effect.
4:02:35
What has been the biggest surprise for you at Mount St. Helens, either
4:02:41
an individual result dynamic, general?
4:02:48
I’ll be very—it’s not going to be long story.
4:02:51
It’ll be very short.
4:02:52
One, is that life is incredibly tenacious and, no matter what natural
4:02:58
insult happens, our expectation should be that there will be survivors.
4:03:04
There will be survivors, the survivors will be present because a number of
4:03:09
different potential reasons, some of them that will be incredibly surprising
4:03:13
to us and not predicted or anticipated.
4:03:19
Where life did survive and more importantly where life did not
4:03:23
survive, that life is incredibly resilient and that life comes back.
4:03:29
It’s been at this for four billion years or so and it’s damn good at it.
4:03:34
The second point is that we don’t need to tinker with things.
4:03:38
We don’t need to rush in and try to fix it.
4:03:42
Restoration in places like Mount St. Helens, a moist maritime
4:03:45
environment with unconsolidated
4:03:49
volcanic debris deposited that we don’t need to go through the effort or planning
4:03:58
and the cost to restore anything because nature’s quite good at it, thank you.
4:04:11
In a perfect world, what would you like to see or continue to see grow at the
4:04:17
science program at Mount St. Helens?
4:04:20
I would like to see
4:04:24
a non-profit Mount St. Helens
4:04:30
ecology and natural history institute formed and that that non-profit
4:04:36
would be a vehicle for training undergraduates, for training graduate
4:04:43
students, providing RA-ships and be a fundraising arm of the research
4:04:49
and also public face and outreach.
4:04:52
It wouldn’t be in competition with the Mount St. Helens Institute, which is
4:04:56
largely a stewardship, natural resource stewardship and science education program.
4:05:02
They would work closely with them and have no overlap whatsoever, but would
4:05:08
complement one another in a seamless way.
4:05:11
This would really be an organization that had ideally some endowment and
4:05:19
an active board that worked with the research community, worked with the
4:05:24
institutions in the region, particularly at the higher levels of administration
4:05:29
at the University of Washington, OSU, U of O, etc., Evergreen State College,
4:05:34
PSU, WSU, to name a few, and also with the PNW Station and US Geological Survey
4:05:42
and build essentially a consortium around the Mount St. Helens research program.
4:05:50
Now you talked about being very little turf war dynamics.
4:05:54
Would you characterize the university active commissions
4:05:58
along with the government sciences to be a very collegial,
4:06:02
collaborative environment over time?
4:06:05
Oh yeah.
4:06:05
I see no reason why that would change whatsoever.
4:06:08
For 35 years it’s been very amiable and compatible, and I don’t see
4:06:15
what would fuel any change, but you know I don’t have a crystal ball.
4:06:20
I don’t anticipate that
4:06:25
being a problem.
4:06:26
How would you best synopsize your history and role at St. Helens?
4:06:32
Well, my role at Mount St. Helens has been because of my being place-based.
4:06:41
I have centralized, been able to centralize a lot of the ecological
4:06:47
research activities and I’ve done so by having my own independent research
4:06:53
program where each year I hire a field staff and have one or two people stay
4:07:00
throughout the year, winter, and we maintain a robust and multi-taxa plot
4:07:09
network and make these data available, one, for our own purposes, but also to
4:07:17
others, particularly graduate students.
4:07:21
Then, engage with others in many collaborative research programs.
4:07:29
Between the two, we maintain a large basic and applied research program between
4:07:34
our own work and our collaborative work.
4:07:37
The other aspect is really being an ambassador to the Mount St. Helens volcano
4:07:42
ecological sciences by networking with people, by providing information, by
4:07:49
bringing people to St. Helens or, if they contact me, I willingly take them
4:07:53
out, make time for them, take them to the sites, discuss research opportunities
4:07:59
and possibilities, connecting people with people and people with place, and being
4:08:06
a clearing house for information relevant to the ecology of Mount St. Helens.
4:08:12
Also, it’s relevance not only to other volcanic sites but to other forms of
4:08:16
disturbances and help facilitate people.
4:08:19
A very pragmatic part is I have a very large base camp.
4:08:22
You and your crews are welcome to stay at our camp.
4:08:27
We are here and happy to help you, to provide technician help,
4:08:34
provide loaning of equipment.
4:08:39
That’s the nuts and bolts of the program, plus then there’s this whole
4:08:44
outreach part, dealing a lot of with media and spending in some cases entire
4:08:50
summers working on hour-long, it’ll be an hour-long documentary in Europe.
4:08:58
Literally working with thousands of media, international, domestic,
4:09:01
regional, national throughout my career everything from Nat-Geo [National
4:09:08
Geographic Society] to Smithsonian, to NOVA, to BioScience, to Science
4:09:15
and then publishing our own work, maintaining a web presence, and, so,
4:09:21
really, I guess being an ambassador for St. Helens and providing everything
4:09:26
that I possibly can to help facilitate and encourage continued vitality of
4:09:34
the Mount St. Helens research program.
4:09:37
In your view what is the most important scientific lesson learned at St. Helens,
4:09:44
either general one or a specific one?
4:09:46
I mean, one is I’d have to say that community assembly
4:09:52
and succession is very messy.
4:09:54
It’s very unpredictable in most cases and it’s highly variable.
4:09:59
We shouldn’t expect a linear progression but that there’s going to be
4:10:09
things will go in fits and starts and that there will be unanticipated twists
4:10:15
and turns along the way and that this created a great opportunity for us
4:10:23
to understand how systems respond to a type of disturbance that has been
4:10:31
so influential in shaping the forest, not only in the Pacific Northwest,
4:10:35
but around the entire Pacific Rim.
4:10:41
What is the spirit of the place?
4:10:44
Mount St. Helens and the region, to you?
4:10:46
How would you describe the spirit?
4:10:48
The
4:10:58
spirit of Mount St. Helens and of the region,
4:11:11
it’s a place that the spirit of the place is one of
4:11:20
beauty, of grace, of full of intrigue and surprises.
4:11:30
I think that it’s a place of renewal.
4:11:34
It’s a place of hope.
4:11:36
It’s a place of satisfaction and comfort.
4:11:44
It’s a place that love can be lost, and love can be found.
4:11:53
It’s a place
4:11:56
to engage with and you can
4:12:03
really pursue any level of curiosity that you might have and never get all the
4:12:11
answers, always get more questions and be entertained along the way and through
4:12:18
the process of all of this you know be touched and touch the lives of so many
4:12:23
different people, either here that you’re working with or more broadly through the
4:12:29
lessons that you distill from your work.
4:12:34
It’s a great place and it’s a place that I hope and I’m certain it will
4:12:42
continue to inspire and to motivate people for generations to come.
4:12:47
Charlie, you couldn’t figure a better way to finish the interview right there.
4:12:51
Thank you.
4:12:52
Uh-huh.
4:12:53
Okay.
