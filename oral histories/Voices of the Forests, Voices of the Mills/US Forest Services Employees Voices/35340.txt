00:03
Hi there.
00:05
This is Sam Schmieding, Oregon State University.
00:08
I am here with Dr. Jerry Franklin, University of Washington, formerly
00:14
of Oregon State University, U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest
00:16
Research, and we are here at the 2015 Mount St. Helens Science Pulse.
00:22
We’re sitting in the staging area campground.
00:25
We’re going to do an interview based on Jerry’s work at Mount St. Helens
00:30
and his experience here, not only since 1980, since the major eruption happened
00:34
and all the science that followed, but we’re going to talk about what happened
00:38
before, as Jerry had some experiences and knowledge of being around St. Helens
00:42
and doing work before the big eruption.
00:45
So, Jerry what are your earliest memories—either from in-person
00:50
experience, readings, photographs, or art—about volcanoes and eruptions
00:54
that formed your original concepts or visualizations of volcanoes?
00:59
Well, I grew up looking at a volcano, which was Mount Hood, and it was visible
01:06
from our house where I grew up in Camas.
01:11
But the whole notion of volcanoes as an active part of my life was not
01:20
something that I was really expecting.
01:23
You kind of saw Hood and also St. Helens on the other side there
01:27
would have been part of your geographical set piece, if you will.
01:31
Very much a part of the geography that I lived in and I grew up expecting to
01:39
be able to see a snow-capped volcano from essentially wherever I was.
01:45
It is a fundamental element in the northwestern landscape and so you’re very
01:53
familiar with it, but you really don’t expect to encounter it in eruptive form.
01:59
Do you ever remember reading about when the last eruptions of either Hood or
02:04
St. Helens or Adams or Rainier or any of the other major stratovolcanoes were?
02:10
I don’t really remember spending a lot of time reading about that.
02:16
But, my first experience with volcanoes as a force of nature was actually in
02:25
a visit to Mount Rainier National Park and there had been a lahar debris flow
02:33
from Mount Rainier, I think in 1947,
02:37
and so one of my early visits to Mount Rainier I encountered that
02:44
for the first time and begin to be aware of the fact that these are
02:50
potentially hazardous structures.
02:53
Was this caused by a venting or a fuming-type dynamic on
02:57
a glacier type situation?
02:58
No.
02:59
The Kautz Creek Mudflow basically was some kind of a dam that had developed somewhere
03:08
in the upper Kautz Creek drainage and I don’t know if it was a rock dam or an
03:16
ice dam, but, basically, it had collapsed and there had been a catastrophic release
03:22
of this water that had been ponded.
03:25
Classic gutted out the head and deposited it all in the lower
03:32
gradient section of Kautz Creek.
03:35
You had to drive across this mudflow and so you were very aware
03:40
of it and they interpreted it.
03:43
I’m going back to my first question just briefly—when you had
03:47
visualizations of volcanism, and it might even have been as a child.
03:50
My first was of a Tarzan movie, for instance, of Hollywood’s version of it.
03:56
Do you remember what did you think volcanoes were supposed
03:59
to look like when they erupted?
04:01
Well, I think you know I certainly must have been exposed
04:06
to images of Vesuvius and
04:13
some of the other and the columnar eruptive structure was the one
04:17
that was
04:21
one that
04:24
I think I saw visualized both in pictures and in movies and, then, I
04:32
probably, there was a series of books.
04:35
I’m trying to remember who—it wasn’t Halliburton’s—but there was a series
04:42
of books about the marvels of the world and I think I encountered
04:47
images of eruptions in that.
04:51
I think my first visualization was Paricutin in Mexico.
04:55
That’s right.
04:56
It grew up in the field.
04:57
Right.
04:57
I remember having a geology book when I was a kid my grandparents gave me when
05:02
I was 7 and it was actually a picture of it—Paricutin was on the cover of
05:05
the book, or a Paricutin-like cone.
05:09
That was my visual.
05:10
I remember that too and the whole notion the mountain could
05:15
grow right out of a field.
05:18
A corn field.
05:19
That was, wow, this is—I couldn’t image that.
05:23
Obviously, it wasn’t anything that could happen in my country.
05:29
Going back to those early ideals, and I think what most of us would have
05:34
thought a catastrophic version of geology and earth history, how do you
05:40
think that view might have affected how you came into St. Helens as a person
05:45
studying ecosystem processes in 1980?
05:50
I candidly never expected to encounter in my lifetime an actual eruption.
05:59
I knew it was possible, but I didn’t view it as probable and I never came
06:04
into these landscapes thinking that this was something that I’m going
06:09
to encounter in my neighborhood.
06:15
Lassen Peak had been active.
06:17
I think Lassen Peak was the most recent active [SS interrupts]
06:21
. 100 years this year.
06:22
Yeah.
06:24
I was aware but
06:28
really that wasn’t that big an eruption.
06:37
I always have viewed my life as one of probabilities and I just
06:42
didn’t figure this was something that was probably going to happen.
06:48
In other words, human timeframes versus geologic timeframes.
06:50
Exactly.
06:51
The odds of this aren’t really good.
06:54
Right.
06:55
Did you have a favorite mountain?
06:58
You talked about Hood being on the—but did you have a, as you camped and
07:03
grew up to learn nature and you lived around it, did you have a favorite
07:07
mountain or a region by a mountain that you developed an affinity for?
07:13
No.
07:13
I don’t know that I had a favorite among the mountains.
07:19
The ones that you’re nearest to and you see all the time are the ones you
07:25
develop the most familiarity with, but Mount Hood is a beautiful mountain but
07:32
it’s not nearly as massive, for example, as Mount Adams or Mount Rainier is.
07:39
Or Shasta.
07:41
Yeah.
07:41
Although I wasn’t exposed to Shasta until I was an adult.
07:47
I think in the early camping that we did we ended up camping at Mount Rainier
07:57
when I was about 10 or 11 years old and I think in many ways I was most impressed
08:02
with Mount Rainier as a mountain, perhaps because I got up close to it.
08:06
And it’s so massive.
08:07
And it’s such a big mountain.
08:10
St. Helens was really notable by its beauty.
08:14
It was very symmetrical.
08:16
But it was a small mountain.
08:18
Fujiyama-esque, I guess they called it.
08:20
It was definitely Fujiyama-esque.
08:24
There was no question about it.
08:26
But our family never really got around and into the Spirit Lake country and so
08:36
I probably visited it once as a child, maybe, but no more than that.
08:45
Now, you did do some work around St. Helens as a young professional,
08:51
correct, before the eruption?
08:52
I did.
08:53
Tell me about that, Jerry.
08:54
Well, my doctoral dissertation was on the vegetation and soils of the Southern
09:00
Washington Cascades and actually I got into Northern Oregon as well.
09:06
Basically, it was focused largely on the area from Mount Rainier to Mount Hood.
09:13
I was doing a study of the forest communities and
09:17
their relationship to soils.
09:23
For five years
09:28
I was basically working much of the summer in that region and so I certainly
09:35
got all around Mount St. Helens and got onto the slopes of Mount St. Helens and
09:45
as part of that I had a good friend who was on the Spirit Lake Ranger
09:50
District, which was a ranger district that was in the Kelso-Longview
09:59
area in the winter and then in the summer moved out to Spirit Lake.
10:05
We went and visited them quite a bit.
10:07
It must have been in the summers of ’63, ’64.
10:13
I climbed Mount St. Helens at that time.
10:18
I had plots on Mount St. Helens.
10:21
I was sampling the vegetation in the Toutle drainage and on the mountain, on
10:27
the south side of the mountain as well.
10:32
I also actually had other, I was doing a study of cone production and had a plot on
10:39
the Timberline Road up [SS talks over JF]
10:42
. This is some of the cone stuff that related to what you started
10:44
down at the Andrews, correct?
10:46
The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, for the record.
10:49
Yeah.
10:51
Anyway, I worked around it a lot and in the process of doing my dissertation I
10:58
became familiar with the recent history.
11:02
There was a fella by the name of Don Mullineaux, and he worked with
11:06
another fella, I think [Dwight “Rocky”] Crandall, and they worked on the
11:11
recent history of Mount St. Helens.
11:15
I began to learn for the first time seriously about lahars, because I was
11:23
driving up, Kalama River lahar many times to do my sampling work and in the
11:32
process became aware that the current mountain was of very recent origin.
11:38
I couldn’t believe it at that point they were talking about it
11:42
being less than 1,000 years old.
11:44
That conical symmetry was also reflective of a young, potentially dangerous volcano?
11:50
It certainly was young.
11:51
You
11:56
could tell that simply because it hadn’t been dissected a lot by glaciation.
12:03
Anyway, in the ‘60s I spent a lot of time in and around it.
12:09
Some of your plots, are the ones that were followed up after the eruption?
12:14
Did they survive?
12:17
For the most part, no.
12:18
Like Roger del Moral, for instance, has got plots up fairly high.
12:21
Are these close to some of the ones that you did?
12:25
No.
12:26
Mine were down in the forest.
12:29
Oh, okay.
12:30
They were fundamentally obliterated.
12:32
Like so many things.
12:34
Yeah, and also by the time of the eruption I had been a
12:41
pioneer in doing vegetation work.
12:44
But by the time of the eruption the Forest Service Area Ecology Program
12:49
had developed and the folks working out there had put in a much greater
12:55
amount of time and intensity, so their plots were the ones that people
13:01
really attempted to reconstruct.
13:03
Would you say that it’s safe to say because of how the canon of things
13:09
in human society—and that would include volcanoes and mountains and
13:12
how people prioritize—that the bigger volcanoes would have been more studied?
13:18
Well [SS interrupts]
13:19
. Ecologically and geologically.
13:22
True, you might think that.
13:25
In fact, Mount St. Helens had attracted a lot of attention by
13:31
Mullineaux.
13:32
And Crandall, right?
13:33
And Crandall.
13:33
So, they published a paper which I reference in my thesis
13:40
on this Kalama River lahar
13:43
and interestingly they wrote a paper in 1978, if I recollect correctly,
13:54
that they submitted to Science on the eruptive history of Mount St. Helens and
14:00
Science sent it to me for a peer review.
14:04
Of course, I was delighted and fascinated by it and wrote back and told them,
14:08
yeah this is really good stuff.
14:10
You got to publish this.
14:11
Was that the one that kind of—
14:12
They predicted—
14:13
It was kind of an alarmist prediction, correct?
14:16
Yes.
14:16
They said that they expected that it would erupt before the millennium.
14:21
They
14:23
were correct, weren’t they?
14:24
They were more correct than they could’ve imagined.
14:27
It was 2 years later.
14:29
Right.
14:30
They were also 2 people that were very involved after the earthquakes.
14:34
Mullineaux was actually the head of the USGS work and he
14:38
was also a kid from Camas.
14:41
We were both from Camas.
14:43
Did you know him?
14:44
No, I didn’t know him.
14:45
Oh, okay.
14:46
But we were both
14:51
Camas High School kids.
14:52
Another—I’m
14:57
trying to remember—anyways, there’s another well-known
15:04
ecologist, environmentalist who’s from Camas, but anyway.
15:07
Anyway, now what about the ecologist, botanist from Purdue, Lawrence?
15:14
It was Don, right?
15:15
Yes, Don Lawrence.
15:16
How and when did you get to know him?
15:19
I don’t’ remember how I happened to get to know him.
15:22
I’m not sure that I even met Don, but I inherited some of his materials.
15:30
So, that’s how it ended up in the Forest Sciences Lab.
15:32
That’s how it ended up in the Forest Sciences Lab.
15:34
Okay, I figured maybe you had a personal relationship or
15:36
a professional one with him.
15:38
No, I don’t think I did.
15:41
I might have met him.
15:44
In any case, you know he had done all of this early work.
15:47
He had been from Portland, had done all the earlier work on the gorge
15:53
and on dating the Bridge of the Gods [landslide] and the early work at
15:58
Mount St. Helens and he had published a bunch of it in Mazamas, the Portland
16:04
mountain climbing club magazine.
16:07
I obviously contacted him at some time because I inherited that material.
16:14
All of his field notes and a lot of his early photography from the ‘30s,
16:18
‘40s and then he came back in the ‘50s and ‘60s, it’s all down there.
16:24
Did you guys use that when you were doing the studies at the
16:28
very start after the eruption?
16:29
No.
16:30
No, really?
16:31
No, we didn’t.
16:32
Interesting.
16:32
Because it would have been interesting from a repeat photography perspective.
16:36
Well, there wasn’t much left to compare to.
16:39
No, it would have been interesting, and I don’t think the thought
16:43
occurred to me at all because
16:49
we were so pressed into participating in the activities so quickly.
16:59
Now, let’s go right up to the years before the big eruption.
17:02
You were involved at the Andrews.
17:05
You were at Oregon State.
17:07
You were still Forest Service, kind of?
17:09
I was Forest Service, but I was also on the faculty at Oregon State and
17:15
at that point in time I was beginning to take on graduate students.
17:20
I had just started that.
17:24
I had been at the National Science Foundation from ’73 to ’75.
17:30
In ’75 I came back and I took over the Forest Service Project Leader position
17:36
that was responsible for the Andrews.
17:42
I also ended up becoming the leader of the academic group.
17:49
In that period between ’75 and ’80
17:58
I was able to be principal investigator on NSF grants and
18:08
that’s an unusual situation and the Forest Service stopped letting
18:12
people do that subsequently.
18:15
They considered it to be a conflict of interest.
18:18
In that period from ’75 to ’80 I became the leader of the ecosystem research group
18:27
that consisted of both Forest Service and
18:32
Oregon State scientists.
18:33
How did your involvement and actually you I believe started the
18:39
momentum toward getting involved with the IBP [International
18:41
Biological Program] in ’69, correct?
18:43
Yeah, ’68.
18:45
How did that decade of shall we say evolution of the Andrews, but also of
18:50
you intellectually and ecosystem science in general, how did that prepare you for
18:56
what came here when you hit the ground running in May of 1980 or June of 1980
19:02
when you first started coming in here?
19:05
Well, it totally prepared me because
19:11
before I became involved with IBP, I was pretty much a traditional
19:17
plant ecologist and had a relatively narrow vision of what I wanted to do.
19:24
IBP
19:28
did a couple of things, one of them was IBP was about ecosystems,
19:34
structure and function of ecosystems.
19:36
I didn’t know squat about what they meant by structure and function of ecosystems,
19:41
but I figured I could find out.
19:46
Ted Dyrness and I had been really concerned about the future of
19:49
the Andrews all through the
19:54
mid ‘60s.
19:55
We were really concerned about it because there was always pressure to give it
19:58
back to the Willamette National Forest.
20:02
The experiment station didn’t need it, they thought.
20:10
Basically, I saw IBP as an opportunity to do a couple of things.
20:16
One was to really capture a big program for the Andrews and also an
20:27
opportunity look at old-growth forests,
20:33
both of which were great passions of mine.
20:40
I made a decision to really aggressively pursue this and was
20:45
encouraged to do so by one of the
20:49
deputy directors of the station, Bob Harris.
20:53
He said, “Go for it, go for it!” In alliance with Dick Waring, at Oregon
20:59
State University we went after it.
21:04
There was going to be this Western Coniferous Biome Program.
21:10
We really pitched it.
21:15
We got into
21:22
a basically, an intense struggle with the University of Washington,
21:28
who thought they had it all tied up.
21:31
In the end,
21:35
we almost blew it.
21:37
Because of the tussle, right?
21:38
Because of the tussle.
21:40
Basically, the folks at NSF were coming out to tell us there wasn’t going to be
21:45
a Western Coniferous Biome because you people can’t agree on how to proceed.
21:51
So, Dale Cole and Dick Waring and I got together and decided how to
21:57
proceed, and UW got the majority of the money, but we got a pretty
22:03
good chunk, about a third of it.
22:06
Then the next big fight was at Oregon State.
22:10
Okay, we’re going to get this sack of money.
22:13
What are we going to study?
22:15
There were a lot of people at Oregon State who wanted to study managed forests.
22:20
That’s the future.
22:23
But there was a group of us, no, we want to study natural forest.
22:30
We won.
22:33
Basically, the program was ultimately directed to Watershed 10
22:38
on the H.J. Andrews [Experimental Forest] , primarily on Watershed 10.
22:42
Dick was the Oregon State leader and I was the Forest Service leader on it.
22:48
Then things got going and we got into it, but NSF liked me.
22:58
They decided I’d be a good Program Officer.
23:02
They invited me to become Program Officer in ’73 for two years.
23:07
So, from ’73 to ’75 I went to Washington, D.C. What happened in that period from ’69
23:17
to ’73 was I really began to learn about an ecosystem and I was part of a team
23:28
of people and we, Dick and I, made the smart decision to go for some post-docs
23:36
to drive the program and I just grew tremendously in that period and then, when
23:46
I went back to NSF, it really broadened my perspective in the array of people
23:53
that I worked with and was influenced by.
23:57
When I came back in ’75, I was really ready to assume a leadership position.
24:03
How would you characterize your ecosystem science chops at that early stage?
24:11
That 6 years—how did you develop things that you would obviously become more
24:16
sophisticated in your knowledge and understanding over the decades, but how
24:20
would you characterize your chops of ecosystem science in 1975, for instance?
24:25
My focus, I think this is what you’re asking, my focus was on structure and
24:31
to a lesser extent on composition.
24:35
So, that was something that fit my background as a
24:39
forester and as a tree person.
24:46
That was my specialty, that was I was contributing to it in terms
24:52
of my own scientific expertise.
24:54
But it turned out I was very good at working with and
24:59
integrating and visualizing a picture of a complete ecosystem.
25:10
I really, I think I function largely as a visionary and I
25:17
function largely as a synthesizer.
25:21
So, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinarity was something that
25:26
really fit with who you were becoming and what you saw as being important to do?
25:30
Exactly.
25:32
And I was good at it.
25:36
A lot of that was simply listening to people
25:44
and working with them and what their interests were, but having
25:49
at the same time a vision of what does this puzzle look like that
25:54
we’re trying to put together.
25:57
So, fast forward to 1980.
26:01
What do you remember when the earthquake started, and the first little crater
26:07
opened up and St. Helens happened?
26:11
What were your thoughts?
26:12
What were the discussions even among the Andrews group about what this was?
26:16
Did you have any idea that you might go study it in a few months?
26:20
No, I really didn’t.
26:21
I discounted it.
26:24
I didn’t really think it was going to be a serious eruption.
26:29
I lacked vision of what could happen.
26:34
There was some people that right away were very interested in it
26:38
and in the early eruptions at
26:44
the very top of the mountain and things like that.
26:48
But I was busy elsewhere, and so I
26:59
was interested, but it certainly wasn’t something that I was thinking about oh my
27:03
gosh here’s going to be an opportunity.
27:08
As the bulge bulged and you obviously were reading the news or you had colleagues,
27:15
what was your thinking as the bulge started pushing out to scary proportions?
27:20
Well, I was I think typical of me in the sense that, no the probability of
27:26
something really significant is going to happen is not going to happen.
27:35
I stayed aware of it, but, again, in no way did I really attempt to pursue it.
27:48
It was interesting but not [SS interrupts]
27:49
. Where were you on May 18?
27:51
I was at home and I didn’t know it had erupted until I turned on the
27:56
television on that Sunday morning.
27:58
You were down in Corvallis, right?
28:00
I was in Corvallis.
28:02
Did you hear anything?
28:03
No, I didn’t.
28:04
I later felt one of the subsequent eruptions.
28:10
I actually felt it in my lungs.
28:13
Really?
28:15
I knew it had erupted again but that first one, no.
28:18
I wasn’t aware of it at all.
28:20
We heard it down in Eugene.
28:21
Yeah, I know.
28:22
We heard something.
28:24
We didn’t know what it was.
28:24
It was like a lateral sonic boom or something.
28:27
I don’t know how to describe it, but yeah, we heard it.
28:31
I was not out of doors and I think that’s why I didn’t hear it.
28:36
But nope.
28:37
Then when I turned on the TV and saw what was going on, I thought oh shit!
28:44
Whoa, this is really something.
28:48
It was a big eruption.
28:50
Yeah.
28:51
And did you know, you know Mullineaux, obviously, and
28:57
Crandall, did you know other people in the area?
28:58
No, I didn’t.
29:00
I’m not sure, I probably had correspondence with Mullineaux,
29:06
but I hadn’t talked to him.
29:08
I’d had correspondence with both he and Crandall, because Crandall had done a
29:13
lot of work at Mount Rainier and I was really interested in the tephra layers
29:19
and the work they were doing with that.
29:22
I think I had correspondence with both of them
29:26
in connection with their work at Rainier and their work on the Kalama River
29:33
lahar.
29:34
How did it come to be where you and Fred Swanson and other people from your
29:38
Andrews team, but also you collaborated with other people, how did that first
29:44
visit or the first trip into the blast zone to start whatever you were going
29:48
to do, how did that process happen?
29:53
I don’t know.
29:56
I don’t know.
30:00
I don’t know what kind of initiative I took.
30:06
I suspect I was being pulled along by, I
30:14
expect I was being pulled along by Fred and by probably by Jim Sedell as well.
30:27
I definitely saw it as an opportunity.
30:32
The work on the Andrews was going very well at that point and it had become
30:37
clear that we had developed the first description of an old-growth forest.
30:44
We had done the initial characterization of an old-growth forest, and this
30:49
was becoming a very relevant topic.
30:53
As Fred had indicated, we were also very frustrated at the planning process as
30:59
we’re going on and for the most part nobody gave a damn about what we’d done.
31:04
The Forest Service wasn’t interested.
31:07
Although the Siuslaw National Forest had been interested enough that they
31:11
had primarily because one of my friends who was a planner over there had asked,
31:19
“Tell us what old growth is,” and that had led to our first publication.
31:25
In any case, I think
31:30
it was going along well and here was this incredible new opportunity.
31:34
We were in the catbird seat because the three of us were natural leaders of the
31:44
activity that was going to go on out here.
31:51
NSF recognized that as well, the National Science Foundation recognized very quickly
31:58
we’ve got to get money out there and we’ve got to provide logistical support for
32:04
the work, but we can’t be funding a whole bunch of individual grants to do this.
32:11
It’s got to be a group effort of some kind.
32:12
it’s got to be a group effort because of the constraints on access to
32:16
the area and things and so very quickly we were recognized as the
32:24
logical leaders for the work, Fred in geology and me in terrestrial ecology
32:32
and Jim on the aquatic systems.
32:38
I don’t remember the circumstances of it, and I’d have to, I’d never, I don’t even
32:45
know if I have my calendars anymore, which was the only thing I really did that’s
32:53
any kind of a record of what I was doing.
32:58
How long after the big eruption did you go in there?
33:01
I think it was about 10 days.
33:05
Who was on that original trip and just describe the helicopter, going
33:11
in, impressions, the whole process.
33:15
I don’t remember who all was in the helicopter that day.
33:20
I think Larry Bliss was there.
33:21
I think Virginia Dale was there.
33:26
I think probably Fred was there, although I’m not sure that he was.
33:36
I don’t think Jim Sedell was present.
33:38
I think it was primarily a helicopter full of terrestrial ecologists.
33:44
We’d overflown the blast zone several days previous to that.
33:51
We really thought a moonscape.
33:54
That’s what it is.
33:57
That was
34:01
our idea going in, but we flew in that morning and we flew to this little lake.
34:08
I’m going to look at the map.
34:10
I keep forgetting what the name of the little lake was.
34:16
Anyway,
34:21
we’re flying into Ryan Lake.
34:24
That’s the first place we’re going to sit down.
34:27
I remember stepping out of the helicopter and looking down and there was the
34:33
firewood shoot coming up through the ash.
34:37
There were just
34:40
the whole landscape was full of these plants that were pushing up through the
34:45
ash and there was lots of activity of ants and beetles and evidence of gophers, so
34:55
I knew instantly I was wrong.
35:00
But I had no idea of the richness of how wrong.
35:04
How wrong you were?
35:04
Yeah.
35:05
This question here, and I’ll just kind of throw this in—what were your
35:08
central assumptions about ecological processes and recovery from major
35:13
disturbance events, volcanic eruptions in particular, before you studied Mount
35:18
St. Helens and the surrounding region?
35:20
Well, my central assumption was that there was nothing left after a volcanic
35:27
eruption, that basically it was a very sterile landscape, a moonscape, and
35:34
that all life was going to have to come in from the edges of that disturbance.
35:43
Of course, Mount St. Helens is a very unusual situation in that it’s
35:50
not primarily about lava flows.
35:54
It’s
35:56
primarily about blasts and depositions, most of which were
36:03
highly root-able kinds of materials.
36:07
Anyway, that was my assumption when I went into it and what I knew
36:12
the instant I stepped out of the helicopter was no, you were wrong.
36:18
There’s all kinds of life here.
36:23
The rest of the summer was spent discovering all the ways in which
36:31
life survived in that landscape.
36:33
Was that true even for the central pyroclastic flow zone?
36:36
No, the pyroclastic flow was the exception, but my attitude has
36:41
always been of Mount St. Helens that primary succession, which is
36:48
associated with the pyroclastic flow, is the tiniest percentage of
36:55
that actual area affected by it.
36:58
I’ve always thought it was way disproportionate focus on primary
37:04
succession, because 98% of the area still had life and organic
37:12
materials and that was by far the most interesting part to me.
37:20
Just that one small zone, then, would
37:24
hold true to your preconceptions, in other words, the center of the pyro—
37:28
That’s right.
37:30
How humbling was that or was it more exciting?
37:35
I’m never humbled by these things.
37:39
I’m delighted by these things.
37:41
It is my nature for some reason to love it when we get blindsided.
37:48
I view these as epiphanies.
37:52
I love them and I love it when I recognize something that I’ve been looking at for
37:59
millennia, or for my lifetime, and haven’t recognized before and I’ve had these all
38:06
through my career, recognizing for example the importance of the big downed log on
38:13
the forest floor was an epiphany for me.
38:16
How could you be so stupid, Jerry?
38:20
I find these surprises to be delights.
38:26
Now, a lot of science, or people in various fields, find it threatening
38:32
sometimes when your paradigms are challenged or totally smashed, right?
38:36
Yeah.
38:39
Now, how would you characterize the succession processes?
38:43
I know that you used the word
38:47
metastasize versus your typical fringe kind of waves, would
38:54
that be a good metaphor for it?
38:56
Sure.
38:56
How would you describe that traditional, based in the traditional ecological
39:00
science from back east and the field ecology that you talked about before
39:04
versus metastasizing and what you saw at St. Helens regarding disturbance,
39:09
survival, succession, immigration, colonization, all those kinds of things?
39:14
Well, the metastasizing is a secondary thing.
39:20
The primary thing that first summer was simply the fact that life and organic
39:26
materials persisted in such abundance with such a very intense and large disturbance.
39:38
This was really,
39:44
the interesting thing was we knew this, but we had not really appreciated this
39:53
until we saw it at Mount St. Helens.
39:55
Anyone goes and looks at a wildfire you know there’s an incredible amount
40:01
of living and dead organic materials left behind, and blowdown events.
40:07
But somehow it just hadn’t registered, and it took Mount St. Helens to say
40:14
you know this is a really big one and it’s really a severe one and just look
40:23
at all the ways and the abundance.
40:28
The lesson for all of us that dealt primarily with the blast zone,
40:34
except for those folks working on the primary succession in pyroclastic
40:38
flow, that clearly the thing that awed us was that survival of
40:47
organisms and of organic materials.
40:53
I can remember
40:56
after the first year getting together
41:03
a group of us at my house and I was in bed because I had a severe back problem
41:10
and they all came to me and we all talked about what do we want to talk about.
41:18
It was all about survivors.
41:22
We wrote an article for National Geographic Illustrated or
41:27
National Geographic, Science or something like that.
41:33
It was not just me.
41:35
It was
41:38
Jim MacMahon and Jim Sedell,
41:43
a bunch of us that had been working out there that summer that said this
41:48
is the message, this is the real important lesson that we’re taking away.
41:54
How did you develop your study science program that first year.
41:59
Obviously, there was the awestruck factor to begin with.
42:03
Then you say okay we’re here, we’re realizing these things.
42:08
How did you start to develop a science program?
42:10
Where you wanted to do your sampling?
42:12
How you wanted to do your science?
42:14
How did that develop that first year and going forward for I think the first
42:17
5 years you had revisitations, like for 5 years, pretty steady, correct?
42:22
Yeah.
42:23
For me, it was very easy to determine what to do.
42:27
First of all, you had to look at as many situations as possible.
42:34
That was important because every time we went a new place, we found a new
42:38
mechanism by which things were surviving.
42:41
Terrestrially
42:45
the goal I had, and I don’t work generally from hypotheses.
42:51
That’s not the way that I work.
42:56
It was simply, okay, we need to get some permanent plots in, and we need
43:02
to distribute them over this various intensities and types of disturbances.
43:11
I wasn’t really going to spend much time myself doing it, but I was
43:17
going to bring people to do it and facilitate other people doing that.
43:24
The important thing about the design was to get
43:30
plots established and the diversity of conditions and in the range of disturbance
43:36
intensity within the blast zone.
43:39
Basically, working in from the scorch area to various gradations
43:44
of the blast zone, correct?
43:45
Exactly.
43:46
Then even in relation to watersheds, lakes, and different
43:50
geographic features, correct?
43:51
Jim Sedell was worrying about how to sample the aquatic systems.
43:57
Obviously, there were a variety of them.
44:00
Certainly, Spirit Lake was one of the areas of greatest intense interest, but
44:07
other lakes, and once we discovered the fish, of course, once the helicopter
44:14
pilot discovered the fish [laughs]
44:17
. You’re talking about in Spirit Lake?
44:19
No, in Meta Lake.
44:20
Oh, in Meta Lake.
44:21
Right, because Spirit Lake, whatever the planting or whatever that
44:25
was like 12 years [JF interrupts]
44:26
. It was a sewage pond.
44:27
Jim Sedell called it a mill pond.
44:31
This was Spirit Lake?
44:32
Yeah.
44:34
The sort of thing, the kind of pond you’d have out back of a sawmill
44:40
that you dumped your logs into.
44:45
He was very interested in seeing a sampling get going in the various stream
44:52
systems and the various lakes and ponds.
44:57
A lot of focus on Spirit Lake.
44:59
It was a sick environment.
45:02
It was kind of a dangerous environment.
45:05
We didn’t know that initially and he didn’t pay any attention to it.
45:12
Neither did I, as far as that goes, but I wasn’t exposing myself the way he was.
45:17
He would get out of a helicopter, plunge into the water, flight suit and all.
45:23
I heard Jim was an interesting character like that.
45:27
He was incredible.
45:29
Anyway, I had two jobs, three jobs really.
45:35
One was to inform myself of the diversity of conditions.
45:40
I flew a lot and I stopped in a lot of places so I could see
45:45
things and see what was happening.
45:49
That was how I appreciated the diversity of circumstances under
45:54
which things were surviving.
45:57
Second job was to organize the establishment of permanent sample
46:02
plot system for the terrestrial.
46:07
The third thing was simply to facilitate the logistics.
46:13
I was the that organized the first three Pulses.
46:18
Those were annual back in the beginning, right?
46:20
Those first there were three in a row and they were all done out of CISPUS Center.
46:26
The third one was actually the biggest one and that one I actually ended
46:32
up having Fred take over the second week of that one because I had to
46:36
go to the far east with a chief.
46:43
You’re helping me incidentally remember some dates.
46:47
That’s what’s good about doing these, they really invigorate
46:52
the whole neuron memory process.
46:55
Yeah.
46:56
There were a whole bunch of things going on in my life at that time as well.
47:06
What was the biggest challenge about coming into the blast zone that
47:11
first year, or even the second year, logistics, transportation, what have you?
47:15
Getting in and out.
47:16
Yeah.
47:17
It was getting in and out.
47:18
We spent a lot of time, I remember waiting for, particularly early in the
47:25
summer, waiting for conditions to be suitable so the helicopters could fly.
47:33
I remember there was a lot of low clouds.
47:35
I could remember sitting out on the Cispus [sports fields] with the helicopters
47:41
waiting for the conditions to, clouds to lift enough, that we could go fly.
47:51
What approval dynamics was there to come in at that time?
47:55
It was Forest Service land.
47:57
How did you get permits to go study?
48:00
That was one of the reasons that we were handling the logistics, because we were
48:07
the ones that were doing the coordination.
48:09
All the coordination was being done with actually the fire control officer
48:14
of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest who had been put into that role.
48:23
There were rules and I think we were reporting where we were going and the
48:33
first year for example the helicopter had to stay with you, couldn’t drop you off.
48:39
If you were in front of the crater, basically this helicopter
48:44
not only had to stay with you, but it had to continue to run.
48:48
So, you had a pretty short time on the ground, because of fuel issues, right?
48:51
Well, when you’ve got a $400/hour machine,
49:01
well, you want to move the table?
49:04
Yeah, just keep going.
49:07
We were coordinating with basically the [National Forest] supervisor’s office
49:12
and they’d tell us what the rules were.
49:16
Another aspect of it was everybody that went in had to have a radio with
49:21
them so they could be communicated with and pulled out if [SS interrupts]
49:27
. The mountain got angry?
49:28
If they were concerned there was going to be another eruption and we
49:35
were the ones who were essentially handling the machines and handling
49:41
the communications and keeping everybody informed of who was where.
49:48
Did you have any close calls with eruption?
49:50
There were two or three fairly major ones after the big blowup.
49:54
Was there ever any time when you guys were a little bit spooked or?
49:57
Nope.
49:57
Never really was.
50:01
Nope.
50:04
Never any close calls.
50:07
I don’t recollect we ever had any injuries,
50:14
any people that got lost or anything in that time.
50:18
If we did, and the other thing we had helicopters.
50:24
We also had four-wheel drive vehicles.
50:26
We did things like provided Joe Antos and Don Zobel with vacuum
50:34
cleaners, which didn’t last very long.
50:39
Because the silica just chewed those
50:43
motors up.
50:43
Just chewed those up.
50:44
But you know it was exciting and stimulating.
50:50
I remember coming back to Vancouver, mostly flying out of the Vancouver, the
50:56
little airport there by the monument and
51:03
reporter asking me, you know, how is it out there?
51:09
You’re supposed to get all serious and you know all the death and destruction, but
51:17
I told her it’s like being a kid in a candy store.
51:21
It’s just incredible out there.
51:24
I didn’t give her a sad story at all.
51:27
I was trying to keep from saying, wow, this is great.
51:31
It was kind of the turning point between what is the previous concepts
51:38
of beauty at Spirit Lake and St. Helens just like Charles Goodrich was
51:42
talking about in that poem at the end of his thing, versus you guys, you
51:46
scientists, whether it be geologists or ecosystem science, or whatever, finding
51:51
beauty in a completely different way.
51:55
The context was shifted.
51:57
Well, and you know I’m not sure beauty was the right word for
52:02
it, but it was a marvelous world.
52:06
It was an exciting world.
52:10
It was bleak.
52:11
It
52:13
was a minimalist beauty.
52:15
Yeah, it was bleak.
52:18
The one thing about working at Mount St. Helens and this
52:21
is still true to a degree is
52:26
most of the time it’s uncomfortable.
52:29
You’re either hot or cold or the wind’s blowing.
52:33
You’re exposed out there.
52:35
You’re not protected.
52:37
Regular work
52:43
out there
52:46
was challenging.
52:49
You got wet and cold and tired and then you were too damn hot, dry, and dusty.
52:57
Yeah, that’s what other people, Fred for instance, have told me that it
53:01
was really hard work, especially early when just everything was difficult.
53:07
Challenging, wonderful, interesting, but hard.
53:09
Yeah,
53:12
it’s very stimulating.
53:14
Did they ever have any problem with the volcanic ash ever getting
53:18
sucked into the helicopter engines or maintenance in that issue.
53:22
No, we didn’t.
53:23
No?
53:24
No, we didn’t.
53:28
Whatever problems there were with that we never saw them, and we never had
53:35
a helicopter with a problem at all.
53:39
Now what kind of technical stuff did you put out in the field in
53:43
your monitoring, your plotting, the matrix of what you put out there?
53:46
Was it fairly simple technology and then did it become more
53:49
sophisticated over time?
53:51
it was very simple technology.
53:56
We didn’t have a lot of sophisticated sensors and we didn’t really have time and
54:04
particularly in the terrestrial arena you know the plant ecologists, mammologists,
54:11
are not used to working with highly sophisticated at that point in time.
54:17
There hadn’t been the breakthroughs in technology.
54:20
There hadn’t been the miniaturization go on.
54:23
Pre-computer era of the kind that figure of today, the digitization
54:28
was two decades off still.
54:29
Of course, there was no
54:35
GPS.
54:35
Basically, it was about traps, live traps.
54:39
Old
54:41
style plots.
54:42
Exactly.
54:43
It wasn’t sophisticated.
54:46
How were you able to keep track of these things since you didn’t know how the
54:51
geomorphology was going to shift and the erosional dynamics [JF interrupts]
54:54
. Oh, you just put them in.
54:56
It was gray.
54:56
How did you keep track of that stuff?
54:58
Well, you marked it.
55:01
We used a lot of steel reinforcing rod.
55:05
We used a lot of plastic
55:10
pipe in order to mark these things.
55:18
It wasn’t necessarily done in a way that was going to be very durable,
55:23
which is one of the reasons we’ve always had a continuing problem
55:27
with maintaining plot locations.
55:31
The other thing is that in the debris flow [avalanche] particularly there
55:36
was a lot of erosion going on and so you put in plots and they’d disappear.
55:41
That was my point—yeah, I mean it was just the ephemeral nature
55:44
of what you were dealing with.
55:45
Well, it’s like Virginia said.
55:46
She started with what 103 plots and then she still had 62 or 123.
55:52
Anyway, she’s lost about 40% of her plots over the history of the study,
55:59
simply because they went down the river.
56:03
For a while we tried to replace them and then just gave that up.
56:09
Just one second.
56:13
The salvage logging dynamic, you talked about it yesterday at one of the points.
56:19
I mean, of course they wanted to salvage everything right away.
56:22
They really did.
56:24
If you could reiterate and go over that, especially with your interest in
56:28
old-growth forest and forestry and how you saw that happening and how far did
56:35
it go and why did it not go further?
56:39
First of all, the private landowners got on it real quick.
56:44
They didn’t have to do environmental analyses or any of that stuff.
56:49
They just, and Weyerhaeuser had done this once before following
56:53
the October 1962 windstorm.
56:56
They had had an immense amount of wood on the ground and they
57:01
totally refocused their entire organization on salvaging that.
57:07
You’re talking about what we often call the Columbus Day storm of 1962.
57:10
That was the Columbus Day storm which was the largest single
57:13
disturbance event in recorded history.
57:16
In the northwest.
57:16
In the northwest.
57:18
I remind Fred about that.
57:22
I still remember Ms. Fillbrook, our babysitter, running down the
57:28
street after our garbage can.
57:31
I was 4.
57:32
I just remember her running down.
57:35
She said, “Stay away from the windows.” Because it was 120-mile winds in Eugene.
57:41
I was in Packwood, Washington, right up here.
57:44
I was on a class fieldtrip from Washington State University.
57:49
I was in my doctoral program.
57:52
Anyway, go back, yeah.
57:55
Basically, you know the private landowners got on it very quickly and in a matter of
58:01
weeks they were beginning that activity.
58:06
Forest Service obviously had to go through a lot of analysis and so
58:14
you know the Forest Service Program really began to get into swing at the
58:20
time that the others were finishing.
58:25
The Weyerhaeuser lands were pretty much salvage logged within, how many months?
58:29
They were all done within 3 years.
58:34
By the third year they were in the tail end of it and the Forest
58:38
Service was really just starting.
58:40
The Forest Service Program, they’re very systematic about this.
58:46
Basically, we’re going to [SS interrupts]
58:48
. We’re going to look at a map here, by the way, for the record.
58:50
I think you’re going to open up and show this.
58:53
Basically, what they did was they started in down here on the Clearwater.
59:01
Let’s see if I can be sure I’m reading this correctly.
59:03
Open it up a little more maybe?
59:03
Yeah, let’s do.
59:09
We’re looking at an illustrated trails map of Mount St. Helens region.
59:14
Here’s the Clearwater.
59:16
They basically started down in this area and worked this way and then they
59:23
also started up here at the north end up
59:31
here by Strawberry Mountain and this other
59:39
lake, Ryan Lake.
59:42
The one where
59:45
you landed at.
59:45
Yeah right here.
59:46
That’s the one that you landed at the first time, right?
59:46
Right.
59:48
That was still in the blast zone, right?
59:49
That’s in the blast zone.
59:50
That was not a scorch zone.
59:51
That would be further out, right?
59:53
Yeah, the scorch zone was right here at that point.
59:56
Basically, they started in up this way and in this way working towards the center.
1:00:04
You
1:00:07
know, I would really have to go back and review the history.
1:00:12
We were in constant conflict with the Forest because they were headed for
1:00:20
salvage and we were trying to leave some areas un-salvaged and we were arguing
1:00:27
that some areas, even if you’re going to manage them you shouldn’t salvage them.
1:00:32
Was that from a perspective of nutrients and overall structure?
1:00:39
Structure, yeah.
1:00:41
It was the beginning of the concept leave some structure behind.
1:00:45
Right, don’t just strip it bare and put in a monoculture, right?
1:00:48
Exactly.
1:00:48
But we weren’t having much luck at all and similarly we were trying to
1:00:55
argue that you need to leave some of this undone, but there was a political
1:01:01
process going on that I wasn’t a part of, and I don’t think scientists for
1:01:07
the most part were a part of that.
1:01:09
Ultimately, it resulted in the establishment of the national monument.
1:01:13
That
1:01:16
stopped the activity.
1:01:18
All I can tell you for sure is I know we were very frustrated and angry at
1:01:25
the rapidity with which this was being done without really much regard for
1:01:32
potential scientific value that was being
1:01:41
lost.
1:01:42
How did this intense, rapid salvage logging, let’s go back to the
1:01:46
Weyerhaeuser lands, how did that affect the watershed dynamics, the
1:01:53
erosion, everything going downstream?
1:01:55
It didn’t affect—basically there was so much dynamics that there were no
1:02:03
constraints at all on Weyerhaeuser.
1:02:05
But what I’m saying is how did what they do affect the overall watershed hydrology?
1:02:10
No one has any idea.
1:02:12
But they just did it, right?
1:02:13
They just did it.
1:02:14
Whatever happened later that’s the way it was.
1:02:16
That’s right.
1:02:18
They took advantage of the situation to cut some green timber that they
1:02:22
wouldn’t have been able to otherwise.
1:02:25
They could just take it all away.
1:02:26
They could take it all away.
1:02:27
Because these were trees, 100’, 150’-200’ high?
1:02:32
That’s right.
1:02:33
They were massive old-growth timber.
1:02:35
They had cut most of their old-growth timber already.
1:02:39
On their private land?
1:02:40
They were about done with it.
1:02:43
They were dealing primarily with younger timber.
1:02:47
Not completely, but largely.
1:02:51
A lot of it, they ended up with a lot
1:02:56
of scorch down in this area that basically they had no value.
1:03:02
They had to just pile it up, burn it, plant it back.
1:03:07
How much of the Forest Service land was salvage timber, approximately
1:03:12
if you were going to recall?
1:03:15
I really don’t know.
1:03:17
I would guess maybe
1:03:23
of the area that was affected; I would guess that they
1:03:27
managed to get about 40% of it.
1:03:33
The volcanic monument, when was that idea hatched?
1:03:38
How do you remember that evolving?
1:03:41
That’s what I’m telling you is I don’t—I wasn’t part of that dynamic.
1:03:51
I would have to go to various sources myself.
1:03:55
I
1:03:58
was supportive of the idea, but I was not a part of any of
1:04:03
the politics that was going on.
1:04:05
I believe Virginia Dale was somewhat involved with that.
1:04:09
Was she?
1:04:10
Well, that’s great.
1:04:12
I know some of the scientists were, but I wasn’t.
1:04:16
Part of it was because I was busy, part of it because I was a Forest Service
1:04:20
employee and I had not yet really established any significant contacts
1:04:28
with politicians, with the congress.
1:04:31
Not yet.
1:04:32
I hadn’t.
1:04:33
That only would happen later when you got involved in the forest wars
1:04:36
and the Northwest Forest Plan and all the follow up to that, right?
1:04:39
That’s right.
1:04:39
Okay, correct.
1:04:39
I think in many ways
1:04:46
Fred’s comment the other day that our experience with the media here
1:04:53
really did prepare us for what was to come in terms of the Forest Wars.
1:05:03
I’m going to return to that in a minute, because I wanted to talk to
1:05:06
you about how what you learned here then reflected back at the Andrews,
1:05:10
but the other things that came later.
1:05:13
In terms of the volcanic monument and how it is zoned and all that,
1:05:18
what would be your take on it now, regardless of what you were involved
1:05:22
with or not back in the day in the early ‘80s when it was beginning.
1:05:26
I was delighted.
1:05:28
Were you surprised that it happened, and it was as big as it was?
1:05:32
Yes, I was.
1:05:36
110,000 acres that’s a pretty good size.
1:05:40
Pretty doggone good size and in the end a lot of good examples
1:05:46
of blown down forest persisted.
1:05:49
They didn’t get to them in time.
1:05:54
I was very, very happy with the fact that the monument was established, and I
1:06:00
was actually happy that it was meant to be administered by the Forest Service.
1:06:08
You mean versus the Park Service?
1:06:10
Versus the Park Service.
1:06:11
Why would be your differentiation in making that assessment?
1:06:18
The Forest Service was going to be more predictably accommodating to
1:06:25
research than the Park Service would be.
1:06:28
At least at that time.
1:06:30
And still.
1:06:30
Still, you think so?
1:06:32
Okay.
1:06:33
The Park Service is extraordinarily unpredictable in terms of its attitude
1:06:37
towards science, because each of the parks is essentially managed
1:06:44
as a fiefdom by the superintendent.
1:06:47
If you have a superintendent that’s sympathetic, you can really
1:06:52
have a good time doing science in the parks, and I did a lot.
1:06:56
But if you have a superintendent who’s very negative, you know he can
1:07:03
be extremely obstructive to science.
1:07:09
I was very happy with the Forest Service administering the monument.
1:07:14
Have you continued to be happy with how that’s evolved in terms of the
1:07:17
infrastructure and the management and even going as far as how it is to work with
1:07:22
this in the science context over time?
1:07:25
Yes, I have been.
1:07:28
It was not, it was a little bit tense initially as the Forest Service,
1:07:38
the supervisor, for example, began to think about, oh my gosh what
1:07:44
am I going to do with this place?
1:07:47
But you know I was on the Science Advisory Committee for it and,
1:07:56
no, I’ve been quite happy.
1:07:58
The people I’ve been most unhappy with have been the
1:08:03
Washington Fish and Game people.
1:08:10
They’re very aggressive about wanting to put fish everywhere.
1:08:15
Yeah, absolutely.
1:08:20
They have had no respect for science values at all.
1:08:24
Do you suspect that they were behind or encouraged the surprise trout
1:08:31
that showed up in Spirit Lake or you think that was a private effort?
1:08:36
I think it was probably a private effort,
1:08:40
but you know then there was the run that was taken at creating
1:08:43
a sport fishery at Spirit Lake.
1:08:47
That’s a relatively recent initiative.
1:08:51
Oh, we got great big fish we ought to have a [SS interrupts]
1:08:55
. Contest, right?
1:08:56
Yeah.
1:08:57
Yesterday I made a joke to the guy who was telling us about the difficulty of
1:09:03
monitoring the floating log mat and I was saying along those lines, I said,
1:09:07
you got to start a reality television show called Spirit Lake Log Rolling.
1:09:13
You could get it funded.
1:09:14
There you go, yeah.
1:09:16
But in terms of the, I know alternative D was the one they chose, which was kind
1:09:21
of a middle ground management between all development and no development.
1:09:25
Are you pleased with how the roads and interpretive stuff and everything
1:09:30
has been designed, let’s say even going toward the public appreciation
1:09:34
and interpretation of this landscape?
1:09:36
Basically yes.
1:09:39
The one thing they’ve continued to fight off is access across the Pumice
1:09:45
Plain and I think that’s the Forest Service has been very good about that.
1:09:49
What the Forest Service failed to do, wasn’t a problem for me at
1:09:54
all, but that has been the lack of investment in visitor facilities here.
1:10:03
They almost lost the property to the Park Services as a result of that.
1:10:08
How long did it take them to build the Johnston Observatory, for instance?
1:10:13
I don’t remember but quite a long time.
1:10:20
Basically, the fact they weren’t building enough infrastructure for people to
1:10:24
even be interested in going to this place was ultimately a problem, then?
1:10:29
It was a problem and it was a real problem for their relationship with
1:10:31
the local communities and counties.
1:10:34
Because they wanted to see economic development out of the disaster, right?
1:10:37
Absolutely.
1:10:39
And Skamania County, particularly, because they’re so dominated by
1:10:44
federal lands and they’re so poor.
1:10:47
Reflecting back
1:10:51
on how this went back to what you were doing at the Andrews and more
1:10:56
importantly the LTER thing, which, coincidentally, was when you were in
1:11:01
that transition from IBP and then I think they called it EER [Experimental
1:11:04
Ecological Reserve] for a while.
1:11:05
Wasn’t that the name before it was LTER?
1:11:07
Yeah.
1:11:07
And you transferred into LTER how did this in your opinion affect what you
1:11:15
brought to the table and what the Andrews became because so many of you people were
1:11:19
involved with this, key people, in taking these lessons back into this new, even
1:11:25
more exciting, long-term research program?
1:11:32
I’m not sure that our St. Helens experience had much direct impact right
1:11:39
away on what we were doing on the Andrews.
1:11:41
The eruption was in 1980 and we had just gotten our first grant, LTER grant.
1:11:50
We had basically in the period immediately preceding that put together
1:11:57
the grant proposal for the LTER and it defined what that was going to be.
1:12:04
What LTER did was actually facilitate some of what we did here because it
1:12:12
provided support for people like Mark Harmon, for example, who then could come
1:12:19
up here and spend some time as well.
1:12:21
In terms of Mark Harmon, and this is not, it’s related, but he started
1:12:27
some of his log decomp [decomposition] carbon cycling work, at least the early
1:12:32
stuff, in the Olympic Peninsula, right?
1:12:34
Yeah.
1:12:34
Then he transferred it over to here?
1:12:37
Or to Andrews or back to here or was kind of a triangle?
1:12:41
Well, he did a little bit of work here.
1:12:43
He didn’t do a lot of work, but he did some initial work on decay processes here.
1:12:52
Actually, some of it was done in Clearwater, down in here.
1:12:58
I guess what I’m really saying is that
1:13:03
LTER provided some intellectual and human resources that we could tap here.
1:13:10
Financial, too, right?
1:13:11
Yeah.
1:13:13
Mark’s work initially was done at Cascade Head [Experimental Forest] on the Oregon
1:13:21
Coast and then on the Olympic peninsula.
1:13:23
So, before that.
1:13:24
Then didn’t Glenn Hawk do some of the original reference stand work
1:13:31
and charting it up on the Olympic, though?
1:13:34
No.
1:13:34
He did not do that.
1:13:35
As a matter of fact [SS interrupts]
1:13:35
. No?
1:13:35
Oh, okay, because I saw his name on some of the maps on the Hoh River Valley.
1:13:40
That’s why I’m asking you that.
1:13:41
He worked there.
1:13:43
The Hoh represented the first real Pulse.
1:13:50
In the early ‘70s we’d had what I called a couple of proto-Pulses where we went up
1:13:57
into the Mount Adams country for a week
1:14:03
and then when I came back from NSF in ’75 we did a small Pulse in ’77.
1:14:17
It was just a weeklong and it was up in the Waldo Lake area.
1:14:20
’78
1:14:23
was the first serious Pulse where we really took everybody someplace
1:14:31
else for an extended period of time.
1:14:34
That was a 2-week Pulse.
1:14:36
How did the concept of a Pulse and even the naming of how you came to call
1:14:41
it a Pulse, how did that come to be?
1:14:43
That was totally my creation, I think.
1:14:48
I was faced with a problem when I came back from NSF that I had
1:14:52
a very large contingent of people who were working for or with me.
1:15:01
They were academics.
1:15:04
They were students.
1:15:05
They were Forest Service employees in my research project.
1:15:11
They all knew me, but a lot of them didn’t know each other.
1:15:16
So, I said well what I need to do is take these people off together for a period
1:15:24
of time so that they can get to know each other and coincidentally what we can do
1:15:31
is probably do something that will have some lasting value and we could actually
1:15:39
test some of our ideas from the Andrews in a different place that nobody had been.
1:15:45
We happened to choose; I chose the south fork of the Hoh
1:15:49
{River] as a good place to go.
1:15:52
The Park Superintendent at that time, that was one that was very sympathetic,
1:15:58
and gave us an exception for the size of our group in a wilderness
1:16:03
and actually flew the camp in.
1:16:09
The idea then was that we would all work in this new environment and we had
1:16:17
the aquatic people and the geomorphic people, and we had the terrestrial people.
1:16:23
Every night we would sit together around the fire and talk to each
1:16:30
other about what we did that day.
1:16:35
There
1:16:38
was a total of about 45 people that participated in that Pulse and
1:16:45
there was a core of us that maybe 20 were there for the full 2 weeks.
1:16:52
Fred was part of that.
1:16:53
Sedell was part of that.
1:16:55
He flew in in a helicopter, typically
1:17:01
Sedell.
1:17:01
Big, right?
1:17:01
Yeah,
1:17:04
and it was very effective, even though the weather was horrible.
1:17:10
Because in the western part of the Olympics it rains all the time.
1:17:12
It rained.
1:17:12
It
1:17:14
rained about 8” that first week we were there.
1:17:20
You come to realize why Lewis and Clark had such a miserable
1:17:23
winter at Ft. Clatsop.
1:17:24
Oh yeah, we really did.
1:17:26
But it really worked well.
1:17:31
The people on these have never become antagonistic towards each other.
1:17:39
Anyway, that was the idea.
1:17:41
I called it a pulse because I was thinking primarily of a pulse of effort.
1:17:48
We’ll all go here, and we’ll put all this energy into a very short effort to
1:17:55
understand something about this system.
1:17:58
Then share at night as we’re being together camping out, right?
1:18:02
Exactly.
1:18:05
The next one incidentally happened to be Sequoia National Park
1:18:10
and we went down there twice.
1:18:12
Suwanee and Crescent Creek, right?
1:18:14
Yeah, right on.
1:18:16
I’ve read your records.
1:18:20
Interesting thing, and I’ve never gotten Fred to explain why,
1:18:24
Fred refused to go on that trip.
1:18:27
The aquatic people did.
1:18:29
This was in what year?
1:18:31
This would have been,
1:18:35
it might have been in ’81.
1:18:39
I have to look it up.
1:18:44
But sometime in the early
1:18:49
‘80s.
1:18:49
Good point.
1:18:50
I don’t know what.
1:18:51
Keep going.
1:18:52
Anyway, that was where the Pulse came from and when we had the St.
1:18:57
Helens eruption, we just transferred that concept right up here.
1:19:01
Since we were providing all the logistics for everybody, I could say for 2 weeks
1:19:10
we’re going to have this concentrated effort at St. Helens and we’re going
1:19:14
to have all this facility and we’ll pay the food and we’ll have the trucks
1:19:18
and we’ll have the helicopters, but
1:19:22
you’re going to have to come every evening and sit down and tell other
1:19:26
people what you’ve done that day.
1:19:29
And damned if they didn’t do it.
1:19:31
Well, it’s really counterintuitive to shall we say the individual model of
1:19:37
science and even my discipline in history.
1:19:39
We still tend to be lone wolfs.
1:19:41
Like Fred said, boy, you guys are really lone wolves aren’t you.
1:19:44
I said, yeah but this thing is teaching me to do different things, just being
1:19:48
around the Andrews and you folks who have been doing this just deep
1:19:53
interdisciplinary and collaborative thing for a long time, because you have to
1:19:57
collaborate to understand an ecosystem.
1:19:58
You do.
1:19:59
No one person or discipline can understand it.
1:20:01
Yeah.
1:20:03
It’s too big.
1:20:04
Yeah.
1:20:04
It’s just too big.
1:20:08
The Park Service people decided to reinterpret the term pulse as being
1:20:15
taking the pulse of an ecosystem.
1:20:19
Mm, yeah, but that seems, that’s too like an instantaneous point in time which
1:20:26
kind of goes against the idea of the totally dynamic nature of an ecosystem.
1:20:31
Would that be a fair way of saying why it wouldn’t work?
1:20:33
For me it was totally a team building exercise.
1:20:37
I agree.
1:20:38
When I first conceived it, so.
1:20:40
I completely agree.
1:20:41
I think it’s a marvelous idea.
1:20:44
It really is.
1:20:45
Anyway,
1:20:48
but the Pulse has continued even down into northern California
1:20:52
for quite some time, right?
1:20:54
Yeah.
1:20:55
Or northern California and the Sequoia area, right?
1:20:58
Well,
1:21:03
yeah that was the only ones we ever did in California were
1:21:06
done in Sequoia National Park.
1:21:08
Okay.
1:21:08
Two of them.
1:21:10
One of them—they were in succeeding years.
1:21:16
That’s the only time we ever went to California with them.
1:21:22
Okay.
1:21:29
Looking back at 35 years of post-1980 ecological research at Mount St.
1:21:34
Helens how would you rate or compare research and findings in terms of
1:21:40
importance to understanding ecosystem processes and their respective
1:21:44
impacts on ecosystem science?
1:21:49
Well,
1:21:52
to just take the broadest look at it I would say that
1:21:58
I don’t know of any other event or place that this has had as much impact
1:22:05
on our concepts in disturbance ecology.
1:22:11
I think you know, and obviously embedded in that is disturbance
1:22:19
ecology at the ecosystem level.
1:22:22
How
1:22:24
much was disturbance ecology prioritized within ecology before St. Helens
1:22:30
and how did that change afterwards?
1:22:32
It wasn’t prioritized.
1:22:33
So, this made a big impact on shall we say the importance or the prioritization of
1:22:40
that within the broader field of ecology?
1:22:42
Right, although I would say there were a number of things that happened
1:22:48
simultaneously that just basically the field the disturbance ecology erupted.
1:22:57
I think you know certainly the Mount St. Helens eruption was probably
1:23:03
the most profound, but there
1:23:10
had been the Yellowstone fires.
1:23:12
There subsequently have been the Yellowstone fires.
1:23:14
There were the hurricanes, particularly the hurricanes down in Puerto Rico that
1:23:25
became part of the LTER program down there.
1:23:28
So, studying the results within the Luquillo [Experimental Forest
1:23:30
and LTER site] context, right?
1:23:31
Exactly.
1:23:32
There
1:23:36
was the Harvard Forest and its experimental hurricanes, where it
1:23:44
pulled down forests and looked at it.
1:23:46
So, St. Helens introduced essentially a decade or more of
1:23:59
important research on disturbances, but probably no place contributed
1:24:06
more than Mount St. Helens to our thinking about disturbances,
1:24:11
the whole concept of legacies,
1:24:16
than this placed has.
1:24:18
Before St. Helens, how did people look at biological legacies, which
1:24:22
I know is one of the things that you really point to as one of the great
1:24:25
learning lessons about this place.
1:24:28
I don’t think they looked at them at all.
1:24:31
Why would you say that was?
1:24:33
Well, it’s because of what the focus had been.
1:24:37
People had been thinking about,
1:24:41
in the east, been thinking about old fields [abandoned farm
1:24:45
fields] , and out here they’d been thinking about clear-cuts.
1:24:49
Those were where they’d studied succession.
1:24:53
The agronomic model, basically.
1:24:54
Yeah, and we knew that there were these incredible legacies of fire and storm,
1:25:03
but no one said this is important people, hey wait a minute, until we had
1:25:10
experienced this incredible event here, series of events and had said you know,
1:25:19
“Hey, the most important thing about a disturbance may be what it leaves behind.”
1:25:30
It just really had a very profound impact on everybody’s thinking about this.
1:25:38
It had huge consequences of course for policy,
1:25:45
how we manage the forests.
1:25:49
Especially regarding fire, because fire, of course, is a much more common major
1:25:53
disturbance than a volcanic eruption.
1:25:55
Lassen was 100 years ago this year and what 64 more years to St. Helens.
1:26:01
Yeah, but you see as a consequence first of all of the Andrews work saying
1:26:08
you know dead trees are important.
1:26:13
That was revolutionary.
1:26:16
Then saying you know, “Hey,
1:26:20
disturbances have legacies and those legacies include a lot of dead trees.”
1:26:28
Whoa, that had huge consequences for what it meant to salvage.
1:26:36
In other words, salvaging everything is just not a good idea.
1:26:39
I mean, basically and I say this all the time now, you can’t
1:26:45
justify salvaging on the basis of contributing to ecological recovery.
1:26:52
You can’t do it.
1:26:54
Wow.
1:26:56
That was a huge change.
1:27:03
That battle really got fought out most prominently in the battle
1:27:09
over salvage of the Biscuit Fire.
1:27:12
In southwestern Oregon.
1:27:14
In southwestern Oregon.
1:27:16
Anyway,
1:27:19
this different perspective on disturbances and the fact they leave behind a lot
1:27:27
of elements, living and dead, really altered our thinking about recovery
1:27:37
processes, what happens afterwards.
1:27:39
How would you say this has been reflected or fought in the
1:27:43
Forest Service, even up to today.
1:27:46
Things have changed a lot since 1980.
1:27:48
It was the environmental age was already well in process, but there was a lag
1:27:54
effect in terms of the administration and the management in the Forest
1:27:58
Service, like there often is in agencies.
1:28:00
But how would you see a generation and a half later how it has impacted the Forest
1:28:06
Service and the general perspective.
1:28:09
You’re going to find outliers everywhere, but?
1:28:12
Well, I think basically it’s become clear that you really, as a federal
1:28:24
agency that has multiple objectives, can’t justify clearcutting.
1:28:33
You can’t justify disturbances where you leave no structures behind.
1:28:40
If you’re going to present yourself as using natural models for the management
1:28:47
of forests, you’re now faced with the fact that, oh, if I disrupt the forest, I
1:28:55
should have to leave some legacies behind.
1:28:59
of course, that would be both from mechanical as well as
1:29:01
chemical processes, correct?
1:29:04
Oh, it would be for a whole bunch of different things, absolutely.
1:29:09
Basically, what I think has happened now is that any organization that
1:29:18
has to incorporate ecological content into what it’s doing
1:29:26
has to at least tip its hat at the model of legacies,
1:29:30
structural legacies left behind.
1:29:33
Just in this area, which is of course just down the road so to speak from
1:29:37
your home turf, how would you say that it’s reflected by the locals,
1:29:41
the local communities 30 years later.
1:29:44
After the go-go days of logging and we’re kind of winding down for a lot of
1:29:48
reasons: economics, different things.
1:29:51
How would you find that’s been reflected with local communities in 2015?
1:29:56
Well, the problem is it got tied up in other things.
1:29:59
What we see today is there is no harvesting going on other than
1:30:05
thinning on public forest lands.
1:30:08
In other words, the enviros will sue for just about anything?
1:30:12
That’s exactly right.
1:30:16
What I was going to say about this, I’ll say it now, so I don’t forget,
1:30:22
the interesting thing was that the same team that was engaged at the
1:30:29
Andrews and then engaged here then went into the process of developing
1:30:34
the Northwest Forest Plan in 1993.
1:30:40
There was a direct relationship from here and everything else that was
1:30:44
contextualizing that to what happened?
1:30:47
Right.
1:30:48
One of the outcomes in the Northwest Forest Plan was
1:30:52
you can’t clear-cut anymore.
1:30:54
You have to leave at least 15% of the forest behind.
1:31:00
We inserted that lesson directly into the plan.
1:31:06
It’s one of several lessons we inserted into the plan.
1:31:12
Now how would you say that the scientific work since those early years has been
1:31:17
assisted by the technological revolution that’s happened let’s say the last
1:31:21
15, 20 years, where you’re number crunching ability, your technological
1:31:25
abilities have greatly increased.
1:31:27
Has that changed much because of that?
1:31:29
Are you still relying on old school plots?
1:31:32
No, it’s changed.
1:31:35
It’s huge.
1:31:36
But unfortunately, we haven’t had a large investment of money that allows us to
1:31:44
take full advantage of those technologies.
1:31:46
They’re making a difference.
1:31:49
What are we doing?
1:31:51
We’re GPSing all of our plot locations.
1:31:55
Wow.
1:31:56
You don’t have to worry anymore about I’ll never be able to find
1:32:00
my way back to that plot again.
1:32:03
I bet you couldn’t find quite a few plots, right?
1:32:06
Oh, geez.
1:32:10
Early in my career I spent so much time looking for plots that are
1:32:14
missing that it’s just incredible.
1:32:16
Did you usually put stakes with bright pink flags and things like that?
1:32:20
Oh, all kinds of things,
1:32:25
yeah.
1:32:25
But we have not been able to take advantage the way we should because
1:32:29
there’s been no sack of money.
1:32:34
Have people in other volcanic environments, how have they applied some
1:32:40
of these lessons learned at St. Helens?
1:32:43
Obviously in countries with different economic contexts, places like Pinatubo
1:32:48
in Philippines, different eruptions in the Kumamoto Peninsula in Russia,
1:32:54
Alaska, how have some of those lessons been applied in terms of studying
1:32:58
ecosystem processes, or has that focused maybe not happened in those places?
1:33:04
They still look at the geology pretty much and public safety?
1:33:08
I couldn’t answer that.
1:33:10
Okay.
1:33:10
That’s Fred’s.
1:33:12
Fred has a much better sense of that than I do.
1:33:21
Now, in your view what ecological research remains undone at Mount
1:33:25
St. Helens in the environs?
1:33:29
Well, I think we’re talking about some of that this morning, but certainly
1:33:37
what remains to be done is to continue to look at
1:33:44
the ecosystem development processes that are going on in the area and the most
1:33:50
important thing that needs to be done, I think, has to do with looking at the
1:33:58
entire area affected by the blast and looking at essentially how that change
1:34:12
is occurring over the entire area.
1:34:14
We were talking about the metastasizing,
1:34:20
the way in which the recovery here is going on as a result of nodulation and
1:34:31
I think that’s extremely important to understand that and to
1:34:41
communicate that because the world is going to be faced with
1:34:47
a lot of large disturbances and they need all the information
1:34:53
they can get about how they work.
1:34:57
35:00
1:34:57
Would you maybe be implying toward climate change and much more
1:35:01
extreme and frequent major fires?
1:35:03
Absolutely, that’s part of it.
1:35:05
Absolutely.
1:35:07
The major way in which we are going to experience climate change is in
1:35:11
fact going to be, in my opinion, a consequence of older disturbance regimes.
1:35:20
Here we have a big disturbance regime that’s been allowed to do
1:35:26
a lot of its recovery on its own.
1:35:29
How has that happened?
1:35:32
I think the notion that
1:35:36
it comes largely through a nodulation process and [SS interrupts]
1:35:42
. Describe nodulation process.
1:35:43
Well, that there are hot spots of survival and recovery and
1:35:52
interestingly there are many different.
1:35:56
We were talking about that this morning.
1:35:58
They are all of very different natures.
1:36:02
Some of them are the result of fundamental geophysical processes.
1:36:09
Early recovery
1:36:12
around water bodies, streams, ponds, wetlands.
1:36:19
These are hot spots of recovery.
1:36:21
Another example of some of one of these hot spots are snowbanks, snow patches.
1:36:33
That one you know is totally a product of chance.
1:36:37
Another example would be
1:36:42
the Sitka alder patches that survive.
1:36:46
Again, that’s just simply an example of
1:36:52
vegetational resilience.
1:36:58
I really think you know what we’re observing here is really important because
1:37:03
I asked people this morning has this ever been talked about in the literature?
1:37:08
No.
1:37:09
There’s no place in the literature about a theory of nodulation
1:37:16
or metastasizing landscapes.
1:37:19
I think we still think very linearly.
1:37:22
Yeah.
1:37:24
Or, let’s say
1:37:27
even what we maybe consider a form of chaos theory or randomness is still
1:37:33
within a matrix of relative simplicity.
1:37:35
Yeah.
1:37:36
Does that make sense?
1:37:37
Yeah.
1:37:38
So, our models maybe reflect that, and even our activities.
1:37:42
I would suppose even just the complicated nature of trying
1:37:46
to do that kind of science.
1:37:48
It’s hard.
1:37:50
I think that’s one of the most important things.
1:37:57
I think you know the lesson of biological legacies is playing itself out.
1:38:04
I think the lesson of the importance of the early successional
1:38:09
system is playing itself out.
1:38:13
Those are both profound lessons that where clearly, they’re obvious in retrospect
1:38:20
that somehow were not obvious in prospect.
1:38:25
That’s usually true of most paradigm shifts.
1:38:27
Well, it is!
1:38:29
Dammit, and you look at it [SS interrupts]
1:38:30
. It’s a paradigm and then we don’t see it, right?
1:38:34
No.
1:38:34
The other side of the paradigm.
1:38:36
I can remember
1:38:40
in the Northwest Forest Plan Fred was arguing what about you
1:38:45
know generating new stand ages.
1:38:51
How are we going to do that if we don’t do some harvesting and stuff?
1:38:58
I told him I’m not worried about that.
1:39:01
Nature will do that with natural disturbances.
1:39:04
Well, Fred was wrong in the sense that he was talking about new
1:39:08
age classes of forests and not talking about the pre-forest.
1:39:14
But he was right that, no, there’s a process here that has consequences
1:39:23
that we’ve got to continue to provide for if we don’t let nature provide it.
1:39:31
I think those lessons are out there now and it’s just a
1:39:34
question of letting them play out.
1:39:37
In many ways it’s kind of like old growth.
1:39:43
In the early ‘80s, I said to myself, you know, alright Jerry,
1:39:49
the science is out there now.
1:39:54
The word is out.
1:39:56
You can’t do anything more.
1:39:57
What’s the important thing for you to do next?
1:40:03
Anyway.
1:40:05
You talked of course the surprising factor number one was when you got out
1:40:11
of the helicopter and saw the fireweed.
1:40:13
So, those surprises, the early days.
1:40:16
But over the course of 30, 35 years of research what has surprised
1:40:21
you the most over the longer haul?
1:40:26
Or what are some of the surprises?
1:40:29
Well, I think the other one after the
1:40:35
survivors and the legacies was 10 years ago when I was walking around here,
1:40:43
thinking when’s this going to recover.
1:40:44
I think
1:40:51
the second big epiphany for me was the recognition that this is incredible!
1:40:58
The
1:41:01
biodiversity that’s present in this non-tree dominated landscape is fantastic.
1:41:09
First
1:41:12
of all, why would you want to terminate it prematurely?
1:41:16
Secondly, my God, you know we’re not thinking about that in the
1:41:23
management of any of our forest lands.
1:41:27
We aren’t providing for this period of freedom from tree dominance that’s so
1:41:36
important not to weeds, but to a lot of really important habitat specialists.
1:41:46
You would say, and I think you said it yesterday, recover might be the wrong
1:41:49
word to apply to many of these situations?
1:41:52
Exactly.
1:41:52
Recovering from what?
1:41:54
Yeah.
1:41:54
And recovering to what?
1:41:55
To what.
1:41:56
To what.
1:41:57
That’s why I don’t like to use recovery anymore because that implies, I
1:42:01
want it back in old-growth forests.
1:42:03
Well, that’s a very anthropocentric context, right?
1:42:06
It’s a very professional context too, because foresters automatically
1:42:11
think wow, if the forest had been destroyed the most important thing
1:42:14
that you can do is get the forest back.
1:42:16
Right.
1:42:17
That’s been time immemorial, right?
1:42:19
That’s right.
1:42:19
I mean in the Gifford Pinchot playbook is
1:42:22
still alive and well, although it’s been modified.
1:42:26
I
1:42:29
like to think Gifford Pinchot would actually be quite delighted
1:42:33
with some of the developments.
1:42:36
Well, that’s the one thing people tend to do, is they romanticize,
1:42:41
they idealize, and they freeze people and ideas in places and times.
1:42:47
They struggle to recontextualize them.
1:42:49
Yeah, they do.
1:42:52
That would be my take, okay.
1:42:54
We talked a lot about concepts in science and studies.
1:42:58
Tell me some stories that have to do with St. Helens in any context
1:43:04
of your experience, since you’ve been coming here since 1980 that
1:43:08
would be interesting as stories.
1:43:12
Well, I think you know I’ve written one already as an introduction to one
1:43:19
of the chapters in the next book I’m writing, and it’s really about that
1:43:26
early imagining about what it was going to be like when we got in here
1:43:31
and flying in and sitting down and discovering it wasn’t like that at all.
1:43:38
That’s a good story to tell.
1:43:40
I told it the other day again.
1:43:47
It’s got some humor in it as well, because it’s easy to
1:44:01
suggest that we were not very bright.
1:44:05
We were not very insightful.
1:44:11
Anyway, that’s certainly one of the stories that
1:44:19
is a good one to tell.
1:44:24
Another story to tell that I can’t really tell very well has to do with
1:44:32
the work with the aquatic systems and the toxicity of those systems.
1:44:42
Some of the personal stories about, for example, the things that Jim
1:44:48
Sedell went through, suffered as a consequence of his early and highly
1:44:56
exuberant participation in the process.
1:45:07
Any particularly humorous or profound memories of all the different Pulses
1:45:12
and the people and just stories that you would say oh, do you remember
1:45:16
the time that this happened.
1:45:19
Sedell that was one story, but any others?
1:45:23
I
1:45:26
have to think about it.
1:45:30
I imagine Fred is a better source than I am because he’s been thinking
1:45:35
about this more than I have.
1:45:41
For me, well, one of the interesting stories you know was
1:45:48
10 years ago was Nalini Nadkarni’s reaction when she came here.
1:45:55
She’s a person that loves tress so much, but she is a scientist and when she
1:46:02
came here, and she saw – I think what tipped her was seeing all the logs in
1:46:10
the lake, she became physically ill as a consequence of it, and she basically
1:46:19
was unable to participate in that session because she was so traumatized.
1:46:28
That
1:46:30
is the way that some people react to
1:46:35
this kind of event.
1:46:36
Well, a lot of people that lived in this area, like Christine Colasurdo,
1:46:42
is she going to be here, do you know?
1:46:43
No, I don’t know.
1:46:45
Yeah, but she wrote the book Return to Spirit Lake, and obviously from
1:46:49
the sense of very personal loss and those people, most of them
1:46:54
don’t ever get over this, do they?
1:46:56
No, they don’t.
1:46:58
I can see why, though.
1:46:59
Yeah.
1:46:59
I mean,
1:47:03
how would you describe this perspective of
1:47:11
the local resident or the person that lived here or experienced this
1:47:14
place versus the scientist, kind of like what Charles [Goodrich] was
1:47:18
talking about yesterday when he read that poem from that Eugene poet.
1:47:21
[John Daniel] How would you put it into your words about the context and the
1:47:25
different perspective of a scientist studying something fascinated with it,
1:47:30
because it’s a unique study subject with all kinds of questions and answers
1:47:36
versus somebody who has this place and it’s tied to their experience and their
1:47:41
family and their region and how would you look at that differently or describe it?
1:47:47
Well, I think you know I think that maybe a good example of a scientist
1:47:52
who couldn’t deal with the change, but it is a question [SS interrupts]
1:47:55
. That is interesting, though, that she was a scientist.
1:47:57
Yeah.
1:47:57
It is in a sense a question of how you respond to change and
1:48:08
if in fact you are very much in love with a particular location,
1:48:17
particular tree, a particular waterfall it could be anything like that.
1:48:23
Then, you know it may well be that you’re
1:48:29
not able to view any positive consequences in that outcome.
1:48:39
I remember my mother describing how upset she was when the
1:48:44
Bonneville Dam buried Celilo Falls.
1:48:47
It was the Dalles Dam.
1:48:48
The Dalles Dam, excuse me.
1:48:49
I’m sorry.
1:48:50
I agree.
1:48:52
There are things like that you never get over the pain of.
1:48:57
Like some of my river runner friends who I interviewed who are still alive, no
1:49:02
matter if they understand the history or not, they cannot accept Glen Canyon Dam.
1:49:08
It’s like the ultimate martyred
1:49:14
landscape.
1:49:15
Another good story is the one I told yesterday about the helicopter pilot
1:49:21
and us going into Meta Lake and working all day and putting in plots,
1:49:26
Meta Lake, and putting in plots and coming out to the helicopter that’s
1:49:31
been waiting for us there all day and asking the helicopter pilot and
1:49:37
helitack foreman, what did you do?
1:49:39
What have you been doing while we’ve been gone all day?
1:49:42
Well, we went fishing.
1:49:46
Oh yeah, right.
1:49:48
Did you catch anything?
1:49:49
[Sarcasm] . I said it in about that tone of voice.
1:49:53
And, yeah.
1:49:57
The discovery that there were fish in Meta Lake.
1:49:59
That’s the lake we visited yesterday?
1:50:00
That’s the lake we visited yesterday.
1:50:02
What was in there, trout?
1:50:03
Brook trout.
1:50:04
Brook trout.
1:50:07
Where did they come from?
1:50:07
They survived.
1:50:09
They survived because that was on the edge of the blast zone,
1:50:13
or the scorch zone, right?
1:50:14
[and under ice cover]
1:50:14
Yeah.
1:50:18
Now the Pumice Plain, how is long is it going to take for that to enter a
1:50:23
different level of succession processes?
1:50:25
I mean, it’s trying.
1:50:27
There’re some colonizers in there right?
1:50:29
In some places there’s a lot of them, but I think you’re looking
1:50:32
at a place that’s still going to be relatively open 100 years from now.
1:50:38
Because geology is much slower than we like to see, right?
1:50:42
I think it’s going to be slow, although there are places on that pyroclastic
1:50:47
flow that already have enough trees that you’re going to be seeing cluster
1:50:52
of trees close and form close patches.
1:50:57
The recovery processes are not necessarily linear places, although they tend to have
1:51:04
a logarithmic kind of response to them.
1:51:09
Things are very, very, very slow initially in that kind of a situation,
1:51:15
but will accelerate over time.
1:51:19
In terms of the conifer forests that are coming back in patches
1:51:23
here and there what’s the species composition more or less?
1:51:27
It’s going to be very different except where trees were planted
1:51:32
and there’s going to be a whole lot more dominance by the shade-tolerant
1:51:37
species that were advanced regeneration buried in the snowpack, for example.
1:51:46
The composition is going to be much more heavily weighted towards higher
1:51:51
elevation species [SS interrupts]
1:51:53
. Noble firs.
1:51:53
Hemlocks.
1:51:55
Hemlocks and silver firs, not noble fir, rather than the traditional pioneers,
1:52:03
which are Douglas fir and noble fir.
1:52:04
There are some Doug firs coming in, but not too many?
1:52:07
Oh, they are, and what it is is a founding population that will eventually
1:52:13
provide seed source for filling in.
1:52:21
How would you describe the cultural place of Mount St. Helens within the Northwest?
1:52:27
In terms of in the northwestern history, how would you describe the cultural place?
1:52:36
I don’t know.
1:52:38
I hadn’t thought about that.
1:52:40
I think in some ways you know the old culture of Spirit Lake and
1:52:49
Mount St. Helens country is gone.
1:52:53
It’s history.
1:52:58
It’s place now is completely different.
1:53:02
It’s a world-scale attraction and it’s a fundamentally altered landscape and
1:53:26
I think the culture of the place is essentially fundamentally altered.
1:53:32
It’s interesting because probably that’s very consistent with where we’re at
1:53:41
in the broader cultural in a sense.
1:53:47
It almost is representative of the loss of the rural,
1:53:57
the small communities, the timber-based economies.
1:54:02
Which just happened to be in full decline when this happened, really?
1:54:05
Which happened to be in full decline when it happened.
1:54:10
Blame the volcano, right?
1:54:12
Yeah.
1:54:12
Instead of the feds and the enviros, right?
1:54:14
Yeah.
1:54:16
No, but I was saying specifically you answered one way of
1:54:19
answering cultural place.
1:54:21
How would you describe the cultural place of the event of Mount
1:54:26
St. Helens within the broader fabric, not necessarily locally?
1:54:29
Just
1:54:32
in your own words, however you’d want to be able to represent that.
1:54:36
Well,
1:54:39
I don’t know.
1:54:41
What do you think it is?
1:54:44
I think it’s a profound moment in the history of the region and the U.S. that
1:54:55
made a lot of people who are noticing realize that geology is alive and well.
1:55:03
It’s current.
1:55:05
And earth processes are not a static thing and even though big volcanic events are in
1:55:12
the timeline of history relatively spread apart they can happen in our lifetime.
1:55:18
Yeah, they can.
1:55:20
There have been other events that are contributing to that as well.
1:55:27
I think it made a lot of people look at the friendly stratovolcanoes
1:55:32
of the northwest [JF interrupts]
1:55:32
. A little less friendlier.
1:55:33
A little differently.
1:55:35
I mean look at all the disaster planning that’s happened at
1:55:38
Rainier and what Nisqually Valley, isn’t that the main one, right?
1:55:43
Yeah, the White River Valley.
1:55:44
The White River Valley, right.
1:55:45
All that stuff.
1:55:46
It’s affected a lot of different things.
1:55:49
I mean I think even where our disaster planning even in terms of
1:55:53
the Cascadia Zone and the tsunamis on the coast, I think it’s all
1:55:57
led into a different awareness.
1:55:59
I think you’re right.
1:56:01
These things happen.
1:56:01
I think
1:56:04
the
1:56:07
one numbing thing about the U.S. is in our continental affluence and our
1:56:11
separation from enemies by oceans, even though you can say that’s changed a
1:56:15
little bit, we tend to be very complacent.
1:56:19
We look at our life like a picture more than a lot of cultures where the
1:56:24
dynamism, the competition, the danger is much more omnipresent and it’s constant.
1:56:32
This is not Syria or wherever else you happen to live.
1:56:38
That’s my little take on that.
1:56:41
Regarding your personal experience, how would you characterize your sense of place
1:56:47
in regards to this place as well as the community that’s part of that place that’s
1:56:53
developed since the eruption, the Pulses, all the different things that you’ve had
1:56:57
interactions with people, epiphanies, etc. How would you characterize it as a place?
1:57:06
Philosophically, culturally, personally, what have you?
1:57:10
Well, it’s a very interesting place and
1:57:20
it’s a much more valuable place than it was previously.
1:57:24
It’s very valuable for education.
1:57:28
It’s very valuable for learning in terms of original knowledge.
1:57:40
From my point of view, it’s a much more meaningful place than it was previously.
1:57:52
It’s extraordinary whereas previously in some ways it was ordinary.
1:58:00
Beautiful, but ordinary.
1:58:02
Yeah.
1:58:03
Because there’s a lot of other beautiful places in the Cascades.
1:58:05
Exactly.
1:58:06
Right.
1:58:10
Do you get excited before these Pulses with anticipation?
1:58:14
Is this something that you just really look forward to on your calendar?
1:58:18
Yes.
1:58:22
I always look forward to getting collections of these people that I’ve
1:58:27
worked with and I respect, and I love,
1:58:36
so yes.
1:58:37
It’s very much like old home week.
1:58:41
But I also really love it for,
1:58:49
I’m excited about it for the
1:58:55
continuity, the generation of younger people that are becoming
1:59:01
involved and engaged with it.
1:59:08
It’s fun but it’s also very,
1:59:17
I’m looking for the word—basically it makes me feel comfortable that
1:59:25
this work’s going to continue.
1:59:29
That you’re among friends but you’re among old friends but also new friends.
1:59:33
That’s right.
1:59:34
The multi-generational thing.
1:59:36
One question I didn’t ask you because it wasn’t on my list because I hadn’t met him
1:59:39
before this week: what is the importance of somebody like Charlie Crisafulli
1:59:44
who has been here from the start and has committed his whole career to this?
1:59:50
Describe Charlie and just somebody like that in a situation like this.
1:59:56
He’s
1:59:59
just extraordinary.
2:00:01
I mean, most fundamentally if he had not devoted himself to this,
2:00:08
we would have had no continuity.
2:00:11
He has been the individual that’s provided the continuity
2:00:18
and kept it from essentially
2:00:24
disappearing, stopping, ending.
2:00:32
He has so much energy and so much
2:00:39
knowledge
2:00:42
and is so generous.
2:00:47
He’s a very unselfish individual.
2:00:52
He’s just a very special person and there’s no way I can do enough for him.
2:01:00
What was his original training?
2:01:03
He has a bachelor’s degree?
2:01:05
Really?
2:01:06
I figured he might have had a master’s at least.
2:01:10
I just found this out.
2:01:12
I figured he was a masters or maybe a Ph.D., but I thought a master’s myself.
2:01:16
I thought a Ph.D., but he has a bachelor’s degree and he came here as
2:01:20
the ramrod, you know the sergeant in charge of Jim McMahon’s program out here
2:01:34
and has stayed.
2:01:38
Never left.
2:01:43
It’s just amazing.
2:01:44
He’s
2:01:46
gotten a lot of rewards from it, but he’s sacrificed so much
2:01:52
for his love of this place.
2:01:54
Well, because I mean he could have taken this experience from the first 5
2:01:57
or 10 years and then gone into graduate school and been a professor somewhere.
2:02:01
That’s right.
2:02:01
Right.
2:02:03
But it also tells you a lot about the model of education and how it’s changed.
2:02:08
Jerry, remember in the 19th century when there were relatively few Ph.D.s and
2:02:14
some of the great natural historians and science people, they only had bachelor’s
2:02:20
or maybe master’s, but they had Ph.D.s in whatever they were doing, right?
2:02:26
Yeah.
2:02:26
They had the Ph.D. in their subjects and their travels,
2:02:30
etc., all that kind of things.
2:02:31
We have very few people like that today.
2:02:34
Yeah, we’re structured into, oh you got to get the doctorate.
2:02:37
It’s mandatory.
2:02:38
That’s right.
2:02:39
What’s it going to do for you?
2:02:40
I don’t know.
2:02:41
It’s a piece of paper and I get tenure and blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
2:02:45
Anyway, what is the relationship for you between geology and ecology at this place?
2:02:54
I know there was some kidding around yesterday between people at the tour,
2:03:01
but how do you look at geology and ecology and how they are compatible
2:03:06
and natural reciprocators in terms of studying not just this place but anywhere?
2:03:14
I don’t really distinguish them.
2:03:18
I don’t separate them.
2:03:22
I think I quit doing that a long time ago, and Fred’s one of the reasons for that.
2:03:29
I just consider the ecosystem to be an integration of all of these
2:03:37
things and consequently you really need to know and understand the
2:03:46
geologic elements of it just as well as the biological elements.
2:03:52
I view the geological as providing the template and you better understand
2:03:58
the template that you’re working on.
2:04:01
I can understand so much more about this landscape today than I used to
2:04:07
when I was doing my doctoral work here.
2:04:11
Why wasn’t there beargrass in this area?
2:04:16
Well, now I’ve got a pretty good damn idea why not.
2:04:20
Why?
2:04:21
It was because beargrass doesn’t survive tephra fall.
2:04:25
Gotcha.
2:04:26
It has no capacity
2:04:30
to grow itself out from under.
2:04:33
Is that primarily mechanical?
2:04:35
It’s totally mechanical because it has no focused growing point.
2:04:43
Instead, it’s growing out of a base of leaves and what’s growing is actually
2:04:50
what they call tertiary meristem.
2:04:53
You burn off the top of a beargrass and the leaves just keep growing out from
2:04:59
that meristem that’s at their base.
2:05:02
Here are the leaves growing out and they’ve got burned ends on them, but if
2:05:09
you bury that plant it has no capacity.
2:05:13
It has no strength to push its way up through it, any
2:05:18
significant depth of material.
2:05:22
When I was doing my doctoral dissertation, here was this extensive area,
2:05:30
literally thousands of acres, where beargrass should have been present as
2:05:37
a dominant in the community, should have been a beargrass huckleberry
2:05:42
community, there’s no beargrass.
2:05:46
Where the hell’s the beargrass?
2:05:49
It’s never gotten back here after all those incredible tephra falls that have
2:05:54
occurred over the last thousand years.
2:05:58
You talked about the reforestation yesterday, how did it affect
2:06:03
the replanting process?
2:06:05
It was easy.
2:06:06
Really?
2:06:08
What they did was they just used augers, power augers,
2:06:16
to basically excavate a little round hole down to mineral soil, the old soil,
2:06:27
and put in a plug, because most of the trees they plant these days are plugs.
2:06:34
So, was the tephra fall maybe because of rain was it almost like concrete?
2:06:41
No, not really.
2:06:42
It was pretty soft still?
2:06:44
It was pretty soft most places.
2:06:46
The reason I ask was I did one season as a hoedad.
2:06:49
Oh, it was easy.
2:06:51
I remember carrying those seedlings and that was the hardest
2:06:55
work I’ve ever done in my life.
2:06:55
It was easy to plant.
2:06:57
Okay.
2:06:58
It was easy, but they were doing mostly auger planting and it really looked odd
2:07:04
at times because in the auger planting they bring up a lot of fresh, white tephra
2:07:10
pumice and spread it out on the surface so you had these little white dots marching
2:07:19
over the landscape and you know it hadn’t vegetated much at all at that point.
2:07:25
They were very successful with their tree planting.
2:07:32
How would you best synopsize your history and role at St. Helens?
2:07:36
Final question.
2:07:39
Well, I think I’ve covered that pretty well, but certainly I
2:07:46
was a facilitator, but I was
2:07:53
also by facilitating was able to control a lot of what happened.
2:08:01
Obviously for me you know I took away a couple of very profound lessons.
2:08:13
In terms of original science that you were a part of, maybe something you published
2:08:17
or not, what would have been something that you would have been the proudest of?
2:08:23
Well,
2:08:29
I’m not sure anything that I published on Mount St. Helens was that profound,
2:08:35
actually, but the concept of biological legacies that I took away was.
2:08:43
I have to be really honest with you, I never really have published.
2:08:48
I have a manuscript, but I’ve never submitted it, was that I
2:08:54
did with some other people that really laid out the concept.
2:08:59
In a sense,
2:09:04
I have never finished the most important publication from this place.
2:09:12
What was that on?
2:09:14
It was on biological legacies.
2:09:18
What would you have to do to complete that?
2:09:20
Not much.
2:09:23
I have every intention of doing that.
2:09:28
Sounds like 35 years is a good timeframe to be able to analyze that
2:09:33
and represent that with some authority.
2:09:35
Yeah,
2:09:37
although I could as well have done it 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
2:09:44
Now, in fact, I think the manuscript is 15 years old.
2:09:50
That represents a failure on my part, but I’ve certainly widely, I’ve communicated
2:10:02
the lesson widely and I’ve ensured that it will be incorporated into management.
2:10:15
One more question—what are the most important management lessons
2:10:18
that were learned from St. Helens?
2:10:19
Well, that’s the notion of providing for continuity between generations.
2:10:31
That’s really what legacies are about.
2:10:33
Legacies are about providing continuity and structure function and
2:10:37
composition between forest generations
2:10:44
or any generations of ecosystems.
2:10:49
That’s what we need to emulate in forest management and management
2:10:56
based on natural models.
2:11:00
Nature basically will almost always provide for continuity
2:11:09
between generations.
2:11:11
She almost never erases a system completely.
2:11:15
I lied.
2:11:16
I have one more question, and Fred’s going to answer this probably in more greater
2:11:20
detail, but what is the importance of actively pursuing the arts and artistic
2:11:30
and literary input to this whole endeavor?
2:11:35
You know, I don’t know.
2:11:40
But off the top of your head, what would be your first reaction to that?
2:11:46
My first reaction to it would be a pragmatic one, which is any way of getting
2:11:52
the message out, of communicating ecology to a broader audience is worthwhile.
2:12:01
I’ve never been the enthusiast for that that Fred is.
2:12:09
You know I retain some skepticism about the value of investing
2:12:16
a lot of resources in it.
2:12:19
But, you know, I would absolutely participate in it and I really
2:12:30
accept it and participate in on the faith that Fred is right,
2:12:38
not because I fundamentally believe it.
2:12:42
Because you’re going to let him have his thing and see where that goes, right?
2:12:46
That’s right.
2:12:48
I’ve been wrong many times before.
2:12:51
Maybe you will be again.
2:12:52
Jerry, I think we’ve had a really great session here.
2:12:55
I want to thank you very much.
2:12:56
Yeah, thank you.
2:12:57
And we will talk again.
2:12:58
Alright.
2:12:59
Alright, thanks.
