00:03
Good day, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding, Oregon State
00:05
University, College of Forestry.
00:09
I am here on July 29, 2015 with Bob Parmenter.
00:17
How would you call your specialty, Bob?
00:20
Tell me how you would like to be represented in the interview.
00:23
Sure, I’m an ecologist, currently with the Valles Caldera National Preserve and
00:29
soon to be with the National Park Service.
00:32
I’m the Director of the Scientific Services Division with the Valles
00:35
Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico.
00:39
Bob has also had a long relationship with research at Mount St. Helens post
00:44
1980 eruption and this is part of the Mount St. Helens Oral History Project.
00:49
We will be talking with Bob basically about his work and experience and
00:54
relationship with the mountain and also with the science and
00:56
the people who have done that.
00:59
I want to thank you for being willing to do this, Bob.
01:01
It is my pleasure.
01:02
We will start away.
01:06
When did you first become interested in biology, ecology, and
01:12
biological, ecological processes?
01:14
Oh, when I was a kid growing up in Virginia, northern Virginia.
01:19
There was a creek and a swamp and old-growth forest just down from my house
01:26
two blocks away by the baseball diamond.
01:29
I’d be in the woods, in the creek all the time catching frogs and
01:33
salamanders and turtles and snakes and fish and small mammals and everything.
01:39
Had a long series of pets in the house.
01:42
My mom had been born and raised up until age 12 in Africa in the Belgian Congo as
01:50
a daughter of missionaries over there.
01:54
She had a lot of pets when she was little, so she was very tolerant of me bringing
01:58
these animals back into the house.
02:02
I just grew up with all kinds of wild animals in Virginia
02:06
and it just kind of stuck.
02:08
I decided to be a biologist early on in high school and was a biology
02:13
major the first day of college and went on to graduate school and you can
02:18
actually be paid to be a biologist.
02:20
It’s a good career.
02:21
Just real quick—where did you go to school?
02:22
Where did you get your degrees?
02:24
Who did you study under?
02:25
Anybody notable?
02:27
My undergraduate degree was in biology as a Bachelor of Arts at
02:35
Colorado College and main people there, the faculty was pretty small.
02:42
There were 8 or 10 faculty members, but Dick Beidleman, who is a professor
02:46
there [he passed away a couple of years ago]; Jim Enderson and Ron Hathaway
02:51
and all these guys are ecologists and parasitologists and Jack Carter, a
02:58
botanist, so they were very influential in getting me out in the Rocky
03:01
Mountains to learn about these things.
03:04
I went down to the University of Georgia for a master’s degree at Savannah River
03:09
Ecology Lab where my major professor was Whit Gibbons, the famous herpetologist.
03:14
I was working on freshwater turtles, but I also had the privilege of having
03:19
Gene Odum on my committee along with Becky Sharitz, who’s a famous botanist.
03:23
So, you studied with one of the famous Odum brothers, right?
03:25
That’s right.
03:25
That’s right.
03:26
I was Gene’s tennis doubles partner for 2 years.
03:31
I got to hang around Gene Odum quite a lot.
03:33
And Ed Farnsworth, an entomologist who hired me as a research assistant,
03:39
so I worked with Ed quite a bit.
03:41
Then I decided at that point I wanted to learn more about desert ecosystems,
03:47
so the International Biological Program, the IBP, was raging, just
03:54
wrapping up, actually, in the mid-1970s.
03:58
The headquarters for the Desert IBP in North America was in Utah State,
04:03
in Logan, with Fred Wagner and Jim MacMahon and folks of that group.
04:08
I figured if I’m going to study desert biology, might as well go
04:11
to the best desert school around: Utah State Biology Program.
04:15
I went there and did a Ph.D. in biology and ecology and we were working mostly
04:21
[again, I was a student of Jim MacMahon’s who became instrumental in the Mount St.
04:26
Helens story here] and we were working in western Wyoming on a big project
04:31
funded by NSF on successional processes and how to strategically accelerate
04:37
succession in disturbed landscapes.
04:40
The disturbance we selected was surface coal mining.
04:44
This is going to, believe it or not, lead to Mount St. Helens.
04:49
In 1979, 1980 we’re just getting this program going on a big surface coal
04:54
mine operated by Chevron Corporation, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, and they’re
04:59
blasting these massive rock walls and coal to remove the overburden
05:06
so they could extract the coal.
05:08
It was just massive rubble fields and what not.
05:12
We were looking at ways to accelerate reclamation up here, to make it more
05:18
efficient and faster and better to get the ecosystem back together again.
05:23
This is high elevation, cold desert environment, shrub steppe systems.
05:29
That’s what I did my dissertation on and then stayed on for a few years
05:33
afterwards as an assistant professor.
05:35
At Utah State?
05:36
At Utah State, right.
05:37
I kept writing myself into grants while I was there with Jim.
05:42
On May 18th, that Sunday afternoon, I’m over at MacMahon’s house.
05:48
We’re having pizzas and beers with a couple of the other graduate students,
05:51
a typical Sunday afternoon in Logan, we’re watching the news about Mount
05:56
St. Helens erupting that morning.
05:59
There’s a helicopter view of the terrain that’s just, this essay of
06:06
white and gray and black and all this stuff and every now and then we’re
06:10
thinking is this in black and white?
06:12
Is there something wrong with the TV?
06:14
But every now and then you’d see a flash of bright yellow in the
06:17
corner and that was the flight suit of the helicopter pilot.
06:19
You realize that this landscape is in color and that’s what it looks like.
06:25
We looked at each other and we said, “That looks like Kemmerer, Wyoming!
06:29
Looks like the coal mine!” Just piles of rubble and rock and primary succession.
06:36
We immediately thought we ought to get in touch with our colleagues
06:40
out in the Northwest and see if we can apply our primary
06:45
successional studies to the volcano.
06:48
Now I take it that Jim MacMahon was connected with the Andrews people and
06:52
Jerry Franklin and people like that?
06:53
Oh yeah, they’d been long-term buddies.
06:55
Because they were IBP people throughout, right?
06:58
That’s right.
06:59
That’s right.
07:00
So, Jim knew Jerry Franklin and Fred Swanson and all those guys really well.
07:06
The upshot was that he got in touch with them right away and spent parts of that
07:12
first summer in 1980 out here, but I was busy with my dissertation work in Wyoming.
07:19
I didn’t get up here in ’80 or ’81.
07:22
But, I finished in the spring of ’82.
07:25
At that point we had some NSF money to do some preliminary assessments up here
07:32
in a gopher project to determine the impact of pocket gophers on islands of
07:37
fertility and successional processes.
07:41
We had an undergraduate, well, a guy who had just finished his bachelors
07:44
degree named Charles Crisafulli, who was hired on the project manager,
07:51
the head technician, essentially.
07:53
Here?
07:54
Yeah.
07:54
For the Mount St. Helens project.
07:56
But he worked at Utah State.
07:57
Oh, so Charlie came from Utah State?
07:59
He was an Aggie.
08:01
Okay, now I see the connection.
08:03
That’s it.
08:04
So, he was in our lab and he had helped us in Kemmerer, Wyoming and so
08:08
he was a real good field biologist.
08:09
He had already demonstrated his skills in that regard.
08:13
Jim hired him as the lead project manager for this grant up in St. Helens.
08:20
In
08:22
1982, we were amassing all the people.
08:26
I was a post-doc with Jim at that time for a year.
08:30
We just got everybody together and came up here to help install gopher plots.
08:35
There were trenched fences that try to keep gophers or keep gophers out,
08:39
depending on the treatment and so we worked up here for it must have been 3
08:44
or 4 weeks that summer and then we went back to working in Wyoming or what not.
08:49
But that got the bug in me.
08:50
I came up every year since then and in 1983 we had, that is when Roger del Moral
08:59
and Larry Bliss, plant physiologists from University of Washington, had gotten an
09:05
NSF grant for studying plant succession on the volcano for 4 years and NSF had come
09:14
back and said this is a great project.
09:16
We’re going to fund it, but where are the animals?
09:19
You guys don’t have any animals in here.
09:22
They ended up calling MacMahon to write an addendum to that grant, and
09:29
MacMahon, of course, handed that to me, because I was the zoologist here.
09:32
MacMahon was as well.
09:33
But I ended up writing this thing and it got funded for 4 years.
09:39
That funded Charlie for another 4 years, and we got continuous measurements through
09:45
the early years after the eruption.
09:47
Charlie eventually became Forest Service, right?
09:50
That’s right.
09:51
The funding ran out in 1987.
09:54
So, he was hooked up here and so he started getting jobs, I think
10:00
they were, it wasn’t full-time permanent, but it turned into
10:05
that up here by the early ‘90s.
10:08
He became the biologist of the Pacific Northwest Research Station
10:13
and has been here ever since.
10:14
Basically, assigned to Mount St. Helens.
10:16
That’s right.
10:17
That’s right.
10:17
He’s been kind of a one-man show in terms of PNW staffing up here.
10:23
He’s done just an incredible job of keeping the science programs going.
10:28
He’s committed his whole career to this.
10:29
Oh, yes, absolutely.
10:31
It’s amazing.
10:31
What a great legacy, too.
10:32
That’s something you can really be proud of.
10:35
We were actually calculating, I think it was last year, the total number
10:40
of publications that had come off the volcano, and, basically, that he had
10:47
helped coordinate, he didn’t author every one of them, but just the coordination
10:53
and the logistics and the permits and technicians where we needed them, and it
10:59
was some astounding rate of publication once every 14 days for 30 years.
11:07
For 30 years!
11:09
Then you add on all the PBS specials [Public Broadcasting] and the NOVA
11:12
specials and all the translation of that information into the public realm
11:18
of knowledge, so that it actually is not just any science articles,
11:23
it’s on TV where the lay person can actually learn about what we’ve found.
11:29
Charlie’s done a spectacular job.
11:31
That’s how I got up here in the early 1980s.
11:34
Going back, I want to just talk about what were your conceptions, either as a
11:39
youth or as a young professional before St. Helens about how you thought volcanos
11:46
were supposed to look and act like?
11:49
I was, volcanos were just you know
11:54
they were just mountains that blew up now and then.
11:56
They would erupt.
11:57
They wouldn’t actually explode.
11:59
They would just shoot large columns of smoke and ash in the air and that
12:04
stuff would come down somewhere or just get into the atmosphere and
12:07
become entrained and blow around.
12:09
I hadn’t given it much thought at all.
12:13
Mount St. Helens was clearly it had a lot of things going for it: the science
12:18
and technology were good at that point.
12:22
It was in an age where remote sensing was just kicking in.
12:27
There were a lot of good techniques.
12:29
There was an understanding from the IBP at that time of linking projects
12:36
together, so botany with entomology with mammalogy and ornithology and
12:41
soils and nutrient science and all this.
12:44
It occurred at just the right time intellectually for North
12:48
American scientists, but it was also in North America.
12:53
It was in the United States.
12:55
That meant it was a home-grown thing.
12:57
The problems created by the eruption and the post-eruption flooding and what not,
13:03
those were hitting American citizens, so the U.S. Government and the National
13:08
Science Foundation was really interested.
13:11
The USGS was very interested.
13:14
The Forest Service was very interested in this.
13:17
It was in the right place and the right time with the right quality of people
13:24
in universities and government agencies that were able to respond to this.
13:30
We talk about the serendipitous nature of the actual eruption having occurred while
13:36
there was still snowpack and occurred during the day versus at night and it was
13:40
on a clear sunny day, so we got photos of it and there’s all of these things
13:45
that just happen to coalesce at the same time and place that allowed us to
13:52
really understand what was going on here.
13:57
What was the first time you visited and saw this place?
14:01
Describe your first encounter with the actual, physical place in the
14:05
mountain in the post eruption.
14:07
Well, my time up here again in summer of ’82 was driving up the 99 road.
14:16
It was a one-lane gravel road with turnouts with trash can lids nailed
14:23
to trees and little signs saying CB Channel 9 used on this road.
14:29
You were supposed to call in about the logging trucks every mile.
14:36
We’re just going up through this forest that you could still see a
14:40
lot of the tephra was lying on the ground and this white dust hung
14:44
in the air as the vehicle goes by.
14:47
We come across a bare meadow and you can’t really see much of anything.
14:53
You can see the volcano in the distance.
14:55
But we get down to where you enter the scorch zone, where we stopped
14:59
on our field trip on Monday, and you turn that corner and there it was.
15:03
You just go, holy smokes.
15:04
That was the vista.
15:07
Of course [SS talks over BP]
15:08
. You just go, wow!
15:09
Back then there was much less successional processes.
15:12
Oh yeah.
15:13
So, a lot less green than you see today.
15:14
Oh yeah.
15:15
Almost no green at all.
15:17
It was a landscape in grays, shades of grays.
15:22
It was really stunning at that point.
15:26
Then when you started to pay attention to the little things.
15:30
You’d see a patch of lupine or fireweed was popped up here or there and you
15:35
could look across the landscape and see a big green square which had
15:40
been a clear-cut prior to the blast.
15:43
It was already colonized by grasses and shrubs whose meristematic buds
15:50
are below ground, and, so, when that blast came across it kind of
15:54
mowed off the above-ground stuff, but the plants were still alive.
15:58
In other words, except for the very center of the pyroclastic flow, which
16:02
incinerated everything, all these other processes were allowed to come up.
16:09
That’s right.
16:10
Secondary succession in some places got a quick jump on it.
16:14
It was just no big deal.
16:17
The plants where already established and they just like somebody took
16:22
a lawnmower to them and they just pop right back up the next spring.
16:25
But, yeah, it was a very impressive view.
16:30
It was really staggering to see landscape that large had been impacted so severely.
16:35
Then
16:37
of course as we’re driving into some of our study sites you get into the
16:45
blowdown zone after the scorch zone and you just see these massive trees for
16:50
miles and miles, as far as you can see.
16:52
It’s just laid flat.
16:54
Now your role, you and/or your team that you were a part of, what was
17:00
your goal that you came in there, or what was your perceived goal?
17:03
Once you got there and you actually saw what was there, how did you develop
17:08
your methodology and decide what you guys wanted to do and how to do it?
17:14
Well, the benefits we already knew.
17:16
We had the trapping.
17:18
We were there to do small mammal work.
17:21
Charlie was going to be doing bird work.
17:24
We were going to start off with some insect trapping as well.
17:27
For the insects we were going to do ground dwelling arthropods,
17:31
because there was no vegetation.
17:33
You’re kind of one-dimensional component.
17:36
It
17:39
was just the size of the area, and, so, we quickly realized that you couldn’t,
17:48
normally you would have a lot of funding and a lot of crews and you’d have
17:53
replicated sites across the landscape.
17:55
Well, we didn’t have time.
17:56
We didn't have the money.
17:57
We didn’t have the staff.
17:58
So, we had to pick representative sites and so what we tried
18:02
to do is match elevations, aspect, the pre-eruption flora.
18:11
When we’re looking for old-growth forests, we’re looking for noble fir or Douglas
18:17
fir, hemlock, that sort of thing, and try to balance it so these sites were
18:23
pretty similar ahead of time before the eruption and then we would follow each
18:28
one based on its level of disturbance and start to follow it through time.
18:35
Now the sites we visited this morning, when were these set up?
18:40
Those were set up in 1981,
18:44
I believe.
18:45
Actually, before you got here, then?
18:47
Right, before I was here.
18:49
Those were up and running.
18:51
A graduate student named Kurt Johnson was doing some of the trapping on
18:56
those places for his dissertation work.
18:59
MacMahon and Kurt and Charlie had picked out a number of these sites already.
19:06
Then, of course, some of them were eventually logged or they were
19:10
salvaged logged or something, so we had to move them and find new sites
19:15
that were quite similar and what not.
19:17
They’ve done a pretty good job of trying to keep things matched up here.
19:21
What do you remember about those first couple of years
19:23
in terms of getting access?
19:26
Permits?
19:27
I mean the process of going in and doing, that logistics of it?
19:31
The logistics were easy on the paperwork side.
19:35
The Forest Service was very happy to have us work up here.
19:40
We had some plots over on Weyerhaeuser land and they were fine
19:44
with us coming in there as well.
19:46
It’s one of these things, we didn’t cost of them anything and
19:49
we weren’t doing any damage and they could get some information.
19:52
That
19:55
part was fine.
19:56
The travel logistics was what was the problem is that the
20:02
roads were in terrible condition.
20:05
Or non-existent.
20:06
Or non-existent.
20:07
Yeah, they were buried.
20:09
Or the areas that were accessible were being salvaged logged.
20:17
There was a constant flow of trucks, empties going in and full ones
20:24
coming out, for the loggers that were actually quite dangerous.
20:28
There were a couple of researchers we heard about [we didn’t know any] but had
20:32
been killed or injured in wrecks with logging trucks and we had a few of our
20:39
own close calls coming up those roads.
20:42
Wasn’t Roger del Moral talking about that the other day?
20:45
Yeah, and we had similar things where you’d be driving up the
20:49
road and calling on the CB radio.
20:52
They had painted mile markers on pieces of tin or on the trees themselves as
20:57
you’re going up, so you were supposed to call on the CB, “Utah State suburban
21:03
coming up the 99-road mile marker 3” and the logger’s coming out, they’d
21:10
come back and say “we’re coming down loaded mile marker 4.” You’d know you
21:16
had about another minute to drive up and then you’d start looking for a place to
21:20
pull over and wait until they’d come by.
21:23
We had a few of those where it was, usually you could tell by
21:28
the amount of static on the CB of how far away the trucks were.
21:34
We had one, just like Roger’s incident, where we’re coming up and we said, “We’re
21:38
at mile marker 12” and immediately the call comes back from a logger says,
21:44
“What mile marker did you say?” And it was crystal clear on the radio.
21:49
No static at all.
21:51
Close.
21:52
That’s right.
21:52
We said 12 and he says, “Look out!” So, we immediately pulled over and 2 seconds
21:58
later he comes roaring around the corner.
22:00
How fast were these guys driving?
22:02
Oh, it seemed really fast, but in reality, you can’t drive very fast.
22:08
Those roads are so curvy you’d go right off the edge.
22:11
But a normal speed limit for those roads would be 25 or 30.
22:17
Coming down loaded, if they’re on a straight away they might hit 35 or 40.
22:21
But, they’d have to downshift for the corners.
22:25
But it was just the momentum, just squash you like a bug if you
22:29
were in front of those things.
22:32
What was your emotional reaction to seeing this in the early days?
22:37
The first time, maybe first couple of years when it was still pretty fresh?
22:41
Yeah, pure excitement.
22:43
Pure excitement.
22:44
It was really, you realize that this is a unique situation.
22:53
It had a little bit of danger to it, because you’re on a volcano.
22:58
It’s steaming the whole time.
23:00
We’re getting swarms of earthquakes and you could hear the rocks falling
23:06
up in the crater all the time.
23:08
Did you ever see any lava dome explosions?
23:12
Not what we’d call explosions, but at night, we’d be camping
23:16
out somewhere at night you’d look back and you’d see it glowing red.
23:20
It was always steaming and smoke coming up, some days a
23:24
lot, some days not so much.
23:26
But it was always right there.
23:28
You knew you were on a volcano and the Forest Service in those first couple
23:34
of years, USGS had developed some sort of a forecasting model based on
23:41
seismic patterns and they thought pretty confidently that they could give you
23:46
24-hour notice before an eruption, and we were camped out on Johnston Ridge
23:55
at one of our sites where a geologist had been killed in the eruption.
24:00
[David Johnston] We were up the ridge from where he had been and on the last
24:05
day we were there, we were just about done putting in those plots, you had to have a
24:09
handheld radio on 24 hours a day, because, if they had to call you out, they’d
24:14
buzz you and we’d have to drive out.
24:19
On the last day they said, okay the model says there’s going to be an eruption.
24:23
We don’t know how big it’s going to be, but you guys need to get out, and
24:26
I said we’re heading out later today anyway and so we’ll just hurry that up.
24:32
Sure enough, the next day there was a small eruption.
24:36
It wouldn’t have done us any harm sitting there, but it was reassuring
24:40
that their models were working and that they were able to give us some heads
24:44
up on when things were going to happen.
24:48
But, yeah, it was pure excitement.
24:49
We knew we were in a unique area.
24:52
We were the only people out there, along with the other researchers.
24:58
But the public wasn’t allowed in and it was like we had the
25:03
volcano to ourselves and it was just one giant outdoor laboratory.
25:08
It was really exciting.
25:10
Now what were some of your central assumptions, either specific axioms and
25:14
paradigms or general, about ecological processes and recovery from major
25:18
disturbance events, volcanic eruptions or otherwise, before you studied at
25:24
St. Helens and the surrounding region?
25:27
I think it was Gene Odum, one of my advisors at Georgia, was the
25:31
old field ecologist of succession.
25:34
He studied at Horseshoe Bend just off campus there in Athens, Georgia.
25:40
He had actually published The Strategy of Ecosystems in Bioscience and had
25:46
a huge reputation on successional processes and how ecosystems would
25:56
reassemble through either primary or secondary disturbances.
25:58
MacMahon and
26:03
our whole lab there at Utah State were testing a lot of that sort of thing.
26:10
You know in the basic form we knew was that, yes, you’re going to have
26:16
colonists.
26:17
This had all been worked out pretty well in the general sense before.
26:21
You would have the initial colonists, some sort of ecesis going on where
26:27
species would sort out by competition and then the facilitation of the
26:34
environment altering the microenvironment so the next species would occur.
26:38
You would get some eventually going extinct and others new coming in.
26:45
You get this relay of succession, this relay of species coming in.
26:49
We kind of knew this was going to happen, but it was confounded by the gradient
26:58
of disturbance from extreme primary succession on the Pumice Plain to just
27:05
the varying degrees of tephra fall.
27:08
You had the gradient of disturbance.
27:11
Plus, you had
27:14
all these different taxa.
27:16
Nobody really knew in detail what the sequence of events would be and
27:22
what the pathways would actually be.
27:24
Are these things going to come across in waves?
27:27
Are they going to look for particular islands and then
27:31
radiate from there and what not?
27:34
You have all this great theory that leads you to a very large number of
27:40
hypothesis, but until you actually get out there and see which one is,
27:46
how it’s playing out, you don’t know.
27:49
How were some of those hypotheses, traditional successional hypotheses and
27:54
otherwise, either supported, challenged, or overturned by the general studies at
28:00
St. Helens, but then specific studies, experiences, results in your case
28:06
or with your team and what you did?
28:09
Well, I think the interesting thing is you can approach this at different levels.
28:15
The concept of islands of fertility of these islands of plants or soil
28:23
disturbances, like gopher mounds, for example, ant mounds, where things get
28:29
started and then they can expand from there coupled with just natural little
28:36
places where seeds can accumulate and the environment’s just fine.
28:42
Those were more or less expected, but it was so obvious to see if you
28:51
would just have a meadow covered in white pumice and now you see islands
28:57
of brown dirt where the gophers had dug them up, that was pretty cool
29:03
and plants growing on those islands.
29:07
Some of the things that we had observed in deserts, nurse plant phenomenon, animal
29:16
burrowing and kind of the bioturbation of
29:22
vertebrates, those were, we expected to see it and the landscape level
29:28
part of that where you see it in some places, and you don’t see it
29:31
in others what’s going on there?
29:33
The overall landscape patterns were fascinating to watch.
29:39
Then you superimpose erosion and erosion channels on top of these things, and,
29:46
suddenly, where you have buried landscapes and meters of tephra and what not and
29:53
you think okay it’s primary succession for a long time here, you get a big storm
29:58
and it cuts down through all that stuff.
30:00
And you get to some real soil, right?
30:02
And you’re back in the original soil, and that original soil still
30:06
has roots and seeds and stuff in it.
30:08
You get these just suddenly popping out in the middle of this bleak landscape.
30:13
Here’s a [SS interrupts]
30:13
. Well, a lot of those seeds can go dormant for a long time.
30:15
Oh, absolutely.
30:16
Yeah, they can be there for years.
30:19
You see these changes happening really very quickly, which
30:23
was surprising as well.
30:27
Then moving up at the larger scale, the legacies of what was actually there
30:34
beforehand, what was the landscape like, the obvious difference there is
30:39
clear-cut, versus the old-growth forests or second-growth forests and what was
30:47
the condition of that forest at the time.
30:49
Then even taking it up to the next scale, to the landscape scale, the
30:55
ability of habitat patches to look at what is essentially beta and gamma
31:03
diversities is that a lot of these species were very particular to some
31:09
habitats, and at the landscape level you have an incredible degree of diversity
31:15
that you would not necessarily have had in a completely forested, when
31:20
everything was completely forested.
31:23
Seeing that was pretty neat.
31:26
So, you’re saying in some respects you were studying a desert in a relative
31:31
sense, or in a literal sense at least the on-the-ground conditions, irrespective of
31:37
the fact that you’re in a temperate zone.
31:39
That’s right.
31:39
Wet, western slope of the Cascades type of climate.
31:43
Yeah.
31:43
But you had to treat it sort of like a desert, right?
31:46
Right.
31:46
Because the microhabitat on the Pumice Plain and the debris avalanche flow
31:54
that was pretty harsh.
31:56
The sun’s beating down on it and it’s hot and dry during the middle part
32:01
of the summer, so the plants had to be really tough to survive there.
32:08
But, of course, when you get into desert ecosystems, your
32:12
successional process is not
32:16
typical of an old field successional situation.
32:22
We have a term for that called auto succession that it’s an accumulation
32:27
of species, but none of them really go away, at least not very many.
32:33
You end up with
32:37
adding species through time as they recolonize a disturbance area until you
32:43
reattain the compliment of species that would normally be in a desert ecosystem.
32:49
But, that’s pretty much because all those species require their
32:54
tolerance of the hot temperatures and the low moisture and what not.
33:01
Out here we sort of expected the same thing to happen, but we didn’t
33:04
know what the timescale would be.
33:06
The timing is really kind of an unknown.
33:11
We know how long it takes to grow a clear-cut back to a forest.
33:15
You got the rotations of the harvest and what not.
33:18
We knew a lot about that already.
33:20
But for this really
33:24
unstudied, highly disturbed area how long does it take to
33:28
really get those things back.
33:31
Because there really had not been a lot of in-depth ecological studies of
33:37
volcanic disturbed zones before this.
33:40
There had been some, but [BP interrupts]
33:42
. That’s right.
33:42
But nothing like this and this in depth, correct?
33:45
That’s right.
33:45
That’s right and in a systematic fashion where all these different disciplines
33:50
were working together in a coordinated fashion to look at everything.
33:58
There were a lot of studies for example on Krakatoa down in Indonesia.
34:03
So, there were some very good assessments of the rates at which plants came
34:10
back there and what species of insects and birds and what not showed up.
34:15
This would have been in the decade right after the big blast in 1883?
34:18
That’s right.
34:19
That’s right.
34:20
Through the late [SS talks over BP] 1920s.
34:24
Was that Dutch or English botanists?
34:24
Mostly Dutch, mostly Dutch.
34:26
Dammerman
34:29
and his colleagues.
34:32
How did some of those early studies even though the sophistication of analysis
34:35
was less integrated and holistic as you would find later just because of
34:40
the evolution of science and ecology, but how much did that stuff help
34:44
you inform or give you a baseline?
34:47
Well,
34:51
we could easily expect to understand that there would be colonists that were
35:00
functionally capable of getting there.
35:03
Of course, you know, the difference between blowing up an island versus
35:09
Mount St. Helens of course is you’re surrounded by sea water.
35:13
The colonization part is a lot different.
35:18
They’ve got to come; your founding individuals have to come a long
35:22
way away and if they can’t fly that far they have to be able to swim
35:27
or ride materials all the way over.
35:29
Or they could blow, couldn’t they?
35:32
Yeah, right, yeah if there were really good winds.
35:34
But
35:37
here at Mount St. Helens you’re surrounded by undisturbed area, so it’s
35:41
really no trouble getting across there.
35:45
You just need to get, have the appropriate habitat as either corridors or
35:54
targeted microsites, so that once you get there you could survive.
36:04
Now, we may go back to a couple of these other concepts that are on my list,
36:08
just kind of synopsize your research focus at Mount St. Helens, how that
36:15
began and how that has developed over time and what it has taught you as
36:21
well as what you think it has brought to the study of St. Helens but also
36:27
the discipline or ecosystem science, the disciplines, plural, shall we say?
36:33
The one thing that’s jumped out at me is
36:38
the different rates of species turnover among the different
36:47
taxa.
36:47
If we look at plants
36:51
there are approximately on the debris avalanche and the Pumice
36:55
Plane, Roger del Moral has found about 150 species of plants.
37:03
Not many of those, just a few of the rare ones, have been extirpated in succession.
37:11
They’re all still there.
37:12
They’ve been accumulating.
37:13
That fits the auto succession component of a desert ecosystem.
37:19
Essentially, they’re still building up.
37:21
It will take essentially shading out by alders and then
37:25
eventually firs to extirpate those from that particular system.
37:31
As it goes into forest, yes, we’ll be able to see that that is occurring.
37:39
But it’s been 35 years and the plants are increasing, but
37:42
none of them are dropping out.
37:46
That’s interesting.
37:46
So, 35 years all of that has happened.
37:50
If we look at birds: same story.
37:52
Birds are increasing in species.
37:54
They’re the open grasslands birds and now shrublands, but you
37:58
haven’t lost any birds out there.
38:01
Small mammals have been increasing but again in species
38:06
richness you haven’t lost any.
38:08
They’re still building up to the full complement.
38:15
We look at insects and it depends on the group.
38:18
If we look at grasshoppers, we’re finally getting in 1995 and 2000 we have our first
38:25
grasshopper nymphs on the Pumice Plain.
38:29
That indicates that they’re reproducing.
38:31
All the other grasshoppers before that were migrants that came in
38:36
during the summer and died there.
38:38
In other words, it’s the beginning of secondary succession
38:41
in the most harshly hit area.
38:44
Yeah, more or less.
38:44
More or less?
38:45
Yeah.
38:46
It’s just primary succession on down.
38:48
You’ve got soil formation and plants and things.
38:51
You finally got enough of an ecosystem and shelter for eggs of grasshoppers
38:57
to survive and the nymphs are starting to be able to survive as well.
39:01
Instead of an allochthonous system where all your organisms, your
39:06
animals, are coming in from the outside, you’re now being able to
39:09
support them and produce them on site.
39:13
It becomes an autochthonous in terms of grasshoppers.
39:18
Some of the populations of course just explode when the
39:21
conditions are right for them.
39:23
They really take off.
39:24
But it’s the same patterns we’ve been following with plants and
39:29
birds – you’re adding species.
39:32
The numbers are accumulating, but you haven’t lost any.
39:36
The beetles on the other hand are incredibly rapid in terms of turnover.
39:44
The early days after the eruption the Pumice Plain was this giant
39:52
cobble beach all the way across.
39:55
You end up with stony soils, pumice tephra soils, which aren’t really soils.
40:03
It’s just like walking on a floor of ping-pong balls almost.
40:08
There’s large interstitial spaces and what not.
40:12
These carabid beetles in the genus Bembidion and some of the agertid
40:18
[Agertidae] beetles that were out on the site are scavengers
40:22
and predators and so all of these
40:27
species are surviving on aerial fallout of insects that are flying
40:34
in or being blown in across the Pumice Plain or across Spirit Lake.
40:41
These insects just run out of gas as they’re flying across and they
40:45
fall down and they spiral down and hit on the Pumice Plain and then
40:49
they’re prey for these scavengers and predators that are on there.
40:53
Or, if they’re flying across Spirit Lake, they run out of gas over the lake, fall
40:58
down, drown, and their bodies are washed up on shore with the flotsam and jetsam.
41:03
There’s these communities of scavengers and predators that are working the
41:09
Pumice Plain, feeding on this fallout that’s being imported to this system.
41:17
As the soils change, it goes from these very gravelly soils
41:23
to much finer soils that are almost like a Walmart parking lot.
41:29
They’re flat.
41:30
They’re hard.
41:31
They’re fine-textured and there aren’t any hiding places anymore.
41:36
But the plants still haven’t really become established except in a few patches.
41:41
At that point, you’ve got a different set of beetles that can start working it.
41:46
As we looked at our data for the last 35 years on the Pumice Plain, there
41:53
are only of the dozens of species that were there in 1981, ‘82, ’83,
41:59
there are only 3 species of that original list that are still out there.
42:04
All the others have disappeared and have been replaced by other species.
42:09
It’s almost been replaced about 3 times now.
42:13
The turnover’s been just phenomenal.
42:15
Now we’re starting to see, finally, all of these things have been strong flyers
42:21
that have been out there in the first 20, 25 years, but now we’re starting to
42:25
see the ambulatory ones, the species that don’t have wings that had to walk from the
42:31
edges in and search for a good habitat.
42:35
It’s really been one of the examples that here’s one group of species that shows
42:43
incredibly turnover, the relay succession that everybody’s been talking about, but
42:48
they do it really fast, whereas plants and birds and things are very slow.
42:53
What’s the life cycle of that beetle?
42:55
The different beetles that [SS interrupts]
42:57
? Well, the different beetles, shall we say.
42:57
Yeah.
42:58
They’ll generally go one year as an adult and they’ll be laying eggs in the
43:03
soil and the larvae or soil dwelling and also predators and so they’ll spend
43:09
some time in the soil and then come out.
43:11
A total cycle is probably 2 years.
43:14
What would be your estimate of how many of them survived to full adulthood?
43:18
Oh, boy, I’ll bet it was pretty low.
43:24
Easily less than 5% or 10% or 20%.
43:27
So, the competition dynamic is really intense out there?
43:30
Oh, I’m sure, yes.
43:32
Yeah, especially among some of these larger populations, because, of course,
43:37
in competition theory you know you’re most competitive opponent is a member
43:43
of your own species, because they do everything just the same way you do.
43:49
These resources can be limited.
43:52
[recording cuts out]
43:54
. Regarding the soils, would you consider that there is an early proto-soil
44:00
developing on the Pumice Plain yet?
44:04
Yes.
44:05
It is.
44:06
The pumice is weathered down so that there are quite a few still cobbles
44:13
and gravels of pumice in there.
44:17
I was just out yesterday collecting cores, but
44:22
they are surrounded by a very sandy, loam soil that has been supporting a
44:29
lot of the vegetation and the mosses.
44:31
One of the observations from yesterday’s work is that there is virtually on the
44:41
sites I’ve been working on the Pumice Plain there’s virtually 100% cover now
44:48
of mosses, grasses, forbs, and occasional shrubs and young firs coming in, but
44:54
mostly it’s moss and grass and forbs.
44:58
Which is the first friendly habitat you might say that’s been out there?
45:02
Yeah.
45:03
For potential growth of whatever species, correct?
45:05
Exactly.
45:05
That’s right.
45:08
We start to see an increase in herbivorous species.
45:12
The grasshoppers, obviously, since the last 15 years out of 35 it took 20 years
45:18
to get grasshoppers out there where they were successfully reproducing.
45:23
The first 19 years there were grasshoppers, but they weren’t successful.
45:27
They hadn’t established populations yet.
45:30
Going up a little bit, what is surviving living in the crater?
45:37
You know, I don’t know.
45:38
I’m sure there’s a bunch of insects that would be up in there.
45:44
The slopes of the crater incredibly unstable, so the ability for
45:50
plants to get a hold in there and survive for very long is probably
45:56
very limited opportunities there.
46:00
Things like small mammals and what not, they’d probably only be transient,
46:04
if they were trying to get in there.
46:07
I don’t know if birds go in there.
46:08
I just haven’t spent enough time up there.
46:11
Now if you were going to go outward from the Pumice Plain towards the
46:14
various degrees of disturbances and degrees, the types of landscapes that
46:20
this produced, how would you take what you just talked about regarding the
46:25
Pumice Plain mainly and extend those principles and observations of what you
46:29
just said and take it in gradients out toward even where we are right now, for
46:34
instance, kind of a synopsis of that?
46:35
Right, right.
46:37
The basic thing is for a zoologist, looking at the animals,
46:43
is there are two components.
46:45
There’s the substrate.
46:46
Are you in the right type of soils for an animal that needs to
46:51
burrow or put eggs in the soil?
46:55
The architecture of the landform plus the organics there, whether they’re living
47:01
trees or logs or stumps or something.
47:04
Finally, the food resources.
47:07
Those three things.
47:08
Then of course superimposed on that are your bionic interactions of
47:13
disease and predators and parasitoids and all this kind of stuff.
47:19
Given those constraints, as you come out from the Pumice Plain and
47:26
you get into the blowdown zone, for example, well, now you’ve got a bunch
47:30
of dead trees lying on the ground.
47:34
They went flush with soil that was already present so they’re
47:40
in contact with the soil.
47:42
The microbes and the bugs that were underneath that soil are
47:47
still alive after the eruption.
47:51
They’re also a lot of areas where there was snow on the ground
47:54
that buffered them even more.
47:56
But a lot of those species are now survivors as part of the legacy, and
48:03
they have to either keep going or perish.
48:07
They’re going to either be able to adapt to the new environment or not.
48:12
Well, if you’re a fungus feeder and a decomposer you’re suddenly
48:20
in hog heaven because you’ve got a lot of material to work on.
48:25
The fungi are going crazy working on these logs, starting to decompose
48:31
these things and then the species that would feed on fungi and there are
48:35
quite a few beetles and other insects.
48:40
They do very well.
48:44
Would the decomp of these large logs from the blowdown be slower because
48:49
it’s not in the middle of a forest where the moisture would stay more readily?
48:54
Yes.
48:55
Would that be true?
48:56
That would be very true.
49:00
At the same time, they’re also getting pounded by UV radiation.
49:04
That’s producing a different dynamic.
49:05
That’s right.
49:06
That’s right.
49:08
It can be knocking them down, but we do get an awful lot of moisture out here.
49:13
Many of these logs are decomposing fairly quickly, melting into the
49:19
ground and subjected to these things.
49:22
But one of the studies we did back in 1986 was a nutrient cycling decomposition
49:31
study and I did this study based on mice, mouse carcasses, because it’s
49:40
already well-known in the literature that different substrates of plants,
49:45
different types of plants, will decompose at different rates based on nitrogen
49:50
content and lignin content and so on.
49:53
The problem is, if you go from the Pumice Plain where you’ve got lupines
49:58
and pearly everlasting and fireweed, up into old growth forest, and you
50:06
want to see how the nutrient cycle and decomposition rates are going, you get
50:11
an old-growth forest, so you don’t find fireweed, pearly everlasting, and lupines.
50:17
They’re not part of the forest floor community.
50:20
There’s nothing to compare directly across in the plant material stuff.
50:25
What we ended up doing is saying we do have deer mice and voles in
50:28
all of these places, so let’s use animal carcasses and see because
50:33
that at least is a common substrate.
50:35
You’re talking about in the areas outside the Pumice Plain?
50:39
That’s right.
50:40
So, Pumice Plain going through the blowdown zone into the scorch zone
50:45
into the tephra fall zone and into old-growth, undisturbed forest.
50:51
We essentially did a litter bag experiment with mouse bodies, mouse carcasses.
50:58
Sure enough, the decomposition rates changed as you went from
51:03
old-growth forest where it was moist and cool, but still pretty warm.
51:09
Things would decompose very quickly there.
51:13
As you moved up that disturbance gradient out finally into the
51:17
Pumice Plain decomposition rates got slower and slower and slower.
51:23
That proved to be quite confirmed our hypothesis that as the architecture
51:32
changes in these disturbed vegetation areas where you have less shading
51:38
and higher temperatures and less moisture that it starts to
51:44
influence these ecosystem processes.
51:48
How has your scientific work at St. Helens been assisted or changed by
51:57
the technological revolutions that have occurred since 1980, whether
52:00
it be in terms of instrumentation or the ability to process data?
52:09
Probably not very much.
52:11
We’re still using pitfall traps, like we did at the beginning.
52:16
It’s still microscope work, pinning and identifying the species,
52:22
counting them up and recording and everything’s pretty much the same.
52:34
Okay.
52:34
Now, I’ve got a series of concepts that I’m going to kind of throw
52:38
your way and just see how you would like to address them from your own
52:44
perspective and your own research.
52:47
Okay.
52:47
Okay?
52:53
Survival.
52:55
Survival is of course critical to the species in the
53:02
different disturbance zones.
53:04
Yes, we want to see year after year if the species continues to exist in
53:10
a particular place and what happens to it when it finally starts to disappear
53:17
and how long it takes to disappear.
53:19
Survival is critical to that.
53:22
It’s really calibrating the turnover rate is essentially a survival factor.
53:30
Immigration.
53:33
Same story.
53:34
At what point we know that for example that all these different species of
53:40
insects or small mammals they exist in the surrounding countryside,
53:44
perhaps in very specialized places, but nonetheless they’re there
53:49
and they’re capable of dispersal.
53:50
Immigration is going to indicate to us that either the corridors are now open,
54:00
that the habitat from the edges to the interior has changed sufficiently that
54:06
these species can move through that and that the environment where we’re doing
54:12
our sampling is now suitable for them.
54:15
That’s the recruitment.
54:17
It’s the flip side of survival.
54:20
Okay.
54:21
When do these things arrive.
54:26
How long did it take you to become firm in your understanding of the things you
54:30
just talked about, for instance, in these two previous concepts that were related?
54:35
To become confident that that this was happening in this way at St. Helens.
54:39
Yeah.
54:40
The concepts were fine.
54:42
They’re pretty ingrained.
54:43
They’re well-known in the literature.
54:46
We’re taught that in classes from day one in general ecology.
54:51
That part was pretty straightforward.
54:53
It was the details of it and the different trophic groups,
55:02
what is their survival?
55:03
What is their rate of arrival?
55:07
Immigration out of the sites?
55:10
Are some groups better at it than others?
55:12
You can hypothesize all you want ahead of time, but really you have to sit
55:16
there and look at them and actually document which ones are coming in.
55:22
I was fairly surprised after you know 10 years and you look out across and there’s
55:28
some patches of lupines and grasses and things are coming in, but we’re
55:32
still not seeing grasshopper survival.
55:35
Why is that?
55:37
Is it soils or what?
55:40
What’s going on?
55:44
Just you come across these questions that you know sooner or later,
55:49
now the grasshoppers are there and they’re reproducing like gangbusters.
55:54
But what led to that, you know,
55:58
what was the tipping point that allowed them to do that?
56:06
Geomorphology and vegetation changes.
56:11
Well, certainly the geomorphology of the landscapes, the hillslopes
56:17
is being driven mostly by erosion and stabilization by vegetation.
56:22
Geomorphology of the streams is, again, the water action, the energy
56:28
and the volume of water coming down, so those things are carving
56:34
new stream channels and what not.
56:39
It’s a mountain of fairly unstable material.
56:43
Things happen pretty fast out there, and, so, I wasn’t too surprised to see that.
56:48
It was similarly on coal mines overburdened piles of unstable material.
56:55
We’d seen that sort of thing before, but certainly not on this scale.
56:59
The geomorphology part is quite, you know, not surprising.
57:08
It was surprising the speed at which it happened.
57:11
But that’s because it’s a very wet climate, so you get a lot of water.
57:15
If it was a desert, if it was a true desert, things would be much slower.
57:21
What was the second part of your, geomorphology...?
57:24
Geomorphology and vegetation change.
57:26
Vegetation change, yeah.
57:28
That has been, you know, we knew it was coming.
57:34
I’ve been particularly pleased that I’ve lived long enough to see the Pumice
57:40
Plain where I’ve been working actually achieve 100% vegetation cover now, or 98%.
57:49
It’s very close.
57:50
Some,
57:53
I note just in the last couple of days, scientists have lamented
57:57
that oh it’s changing so fast.
58:01
We hate to see it change and what not.
58:03
I’m thrilled that I’m alive to see it.
58:06
That actually I could get through that much, much like seeing a forest regenerate
58:13
after a fire or something like that.
58:17
If it was going to happen, I’m glad I was here to see it.
58:20
Nutrient cycling and chemical interactions.
58:25
Yeah, well the nutrient cycling part is interesting because that’s
58:29
something after my interest here.
58:36
I’ve been disappointed that there hasn’t been more work
58:40
on nutrient cycling out here.
58:43
Aside from my, in the first book, after 20, 25 years of studies out
58:49
here my study on mouse carcass decomposition was the only nutrient
58:55
cycling stuff that had been done.
58:58
It was all, no one’s gone out and done litter bags and what not to ever
59:04
ascertain these rates of litter decomp.
59:08
They can still be done, but, of course, things are changing rapidly now.
59:12
I would have liked to have seen a little bit more done on that.
59:16
What would be, from what your experience of 30+ years, what would be your, shall
59:22
we say, theorem going into studying that if you were going to test something or
59:28
speculate about what you think might be true or that you wanted to find out
59:32
and test it regarding nutrient cycling?
59:35
Nutrient cycling, yeah.
59:37
Well, it’s kind of, some things are being done.
59:40
So, a number of scientists have been looking at organic
59:43
content accumulation in soils.
59:46
That kind of gives you the soil buildup process and carbon development.
59:52
Of course, they get nitrogen and phosphorus and a number
59:55
of things out of that as well.
59:59
The decomposition rates, what is the fate of litter out there when
1:00:05
a plant dies what happens to it?
1:00:08
Does it just shrivel up and blow away to somewhere else?
1:00:13
Fall into a stream and, eventually, get washed down into the lakes?
1:00:19
You know I’m not sure that we have a real good idea on that.
1:00:23
But, certainly, there’s obviously a lot of biomass that’s building up out there.
1:00:29
You can do those budgets.
1:00:32
We have some of the scientists are doing budgets of nitrogen and phosphorus and
1:00:37
what not and biomass in Spirit Lake.
1:00:41
The aquatic systems are working pretty well.
1:00:46
Yeah,
1:00:48
overall, the spatial distribution and timing of
1:00:54
decomposition
1:00:57
processes would be interesting to know.
1:01:04
The microtopography of soil buildup and development is fascinating.
1:01:10
And
1:01:12
that’s happened even in the most harshly hit areas, correct?
1:01:16
That’s right.
1:01:17
What’s the normal time for fully developed soils to develop from
1:01:22
something like this in the most extreme zones in terms of before St. Helens?
1:01:27
What would have people thought?
1:01:30
Well, certainly in arid lands you don’t get soil buildup.
1:01:33
It’s really a question of weathering the rock parent material by sun, wind,
1:01:41
water, things of this nature with some biotic interactions, lichens for
1:01:47
example can break these things down.
1:01:54
I guess
1:01:57
the,
1:02:03
yeah, I’m not sure.
1:02:06
The landscape level patterns of this is something that Mount St. Helens
1:02:11
can probably teach us, but it’s almost like I wish it would erupt
1:02:16
again so we can do everything over and say we kind of understand the
1:02:22
gaps of where we’ve missed stuff.
1:02:24
You’d like a 35-year mulligan?
1:02:26
That’s right, exactly.
1:02:27
Let’s do it over!
1:02:28
Do it over!
1:02:29
Because now we’d really have it done very well.
1:02:33
I think that’s the advantage of Charlie and Fred and going down to Chile and
1:02:39
other places because they can say okay here’s what we really need to look at.
1:02:46
Now in your view what ecological research remains undone at Mount St. Helens?
1:02:52
I will ask you specifically to your specialty what you’ve done here, but also
1:02:56
as a person who’s seen this scientific program unfold, comments on both
1:03:03
of those?
1:03:04
Sure.
1:03:06
I’m not sure that we’d know very much about corridors of animal
1:03:11
movement for colonization.
1:03:14
We don’t know the specifics of because that would require some sort of
1:03:22
radiotelemetry, some kinds of studies.
1:03:26
The fine, fine grain movement of animals is not very well-known,
1:03:30
except for things like elk.
1:03:32
Megafauna, in other words.
1:03:34
Right.
1:03:38
I think nutrient cycling could have been done better.
1:03:43
Soil development could have been done, at least on our sites,
1:03:47
we should have done it better.
1:03:52
It’s hard to find even published records of sand, silt, and clay composition in
1:04:01
gravel and cobble and what not, just texture analyses of soils of these things.
1:04:05
They’ve been done in some places, but not extensively that I can find.
1:04:11
The
1:04:15
vegetation has been covered pretty well.
1:04:17
That’s one of the bright spots.
1:04:18
The aquatic systems seem to have been done pretty well.
1:04:24
That started with Jim Sedell, didn’t it?
1:04:26
Mm-hmm.
1:04:27
Right.
1:04:28
Cliff
1:04:32
Dahm, Chuck Hawkins from Utah State and Cliff from the University of New Mexico.
1:04:41
There were some things that have been done very well.
1:04:43
I would probably do more in terms of the insect world.
1:04:48
We’ve concentrated on the surface-active arthropods.
1:04:54
But I would have encouraged other entomologists to do plant-dwelling
1:05:00
arthropods as well to try to pick up more and more of those, flying
1:05:06
ones, malaise traps and things.
1:05:10
But all this takes a lot of money, takes a lot of funding to get all
1:05:16
the expertise necessary to do that.
1:05:19
What has it been like to work with the National Monument in terms
1:05:23
of the science zones and permits and things like that over time?
1:05:29
It’s been a piece of cake.
1:05:31
It’s been no trouble at all.
1:05:32
Charlie takes care of that and Peter Frenzen has been really
1:05:38
excited about people coming up here, so there’s no static at all.
1:05:45
They’re very helpful, very amenable to getting out and doing things.
1:05:52
Based on your long relationship with this research in this region
1:05:57
and the mountain, what would be some ecological prognostications
1:06:01
about St. Helens that you might want to say I can see this happening?
1:06:09
Yeah, I think the
1:06:12
one thing a lot of us have talked about is, aside from the actual
1:06:16
crater, for the landscape in 100 years the casual tourist will never
1:06:25
know that an eruption took place.
1:06:28
Spirit Lake will have trees all around it again.
1:06:31
It will be this idyllic lake to go fishing and canoeing and what not in and
1:06:39
aside from looking up at a snow-covered Mount St. Helens with this gaping crater
1:06:45
in the middle of it [SS interrupts]
1:06:47
. You won’t have the Fujiyama effect anymore.
1:06:49
That’s right.
1:06:51
But you’ll have something similar to what it was before?
1:06:54
You actually believe that’s in 100 years.
1:06:57
That’s right.
1:06:57
Yep.
1:06:57
Because in 35 years already you’re seeing
1:07:02
huge numbers of firs and pine out on the Pumice Plain.
1:07:09
They will be putting on a foot a year in growth and so in 20 years’ time, they’re
1:07:16
20-30 feet taller than they are now.
1:07:20
While they appear to be relatively inconspicuous now, there’s actually
1:07:24
a lot of them out there, so it’s going to turn into almost a taiga
1:07:29
or savannah type situation with lots of trees, very park-like.
1:07:35
It’ll look very park-like out there.
1:07:40
As those fill in, they’re only going to be 20, 30 years behind the larger
1:07:49
ones that are getting established now.
1:07:52
It’s really, it’s going to be a forested landscape again until you get up
1:07:57
above the tree line almost and there it’s going to be an obvious volcano.
1:08:04
But that would be my guess is that the ability to recognize this as a
1:08:12
highly disturbed volcanic landscape is going to be fading pretty fast.
1:08:17
What previous research in this area and on the mountain – were any of you able
1:08:22
to tap into that happened before 1980?
1:08:29
For me, the work that was done at the H.J. Andrews for the insects of what
1:08:38
you would expect to find in old-growth forest has been very valuable.
1:08:42
I still use their publications today.
1:08:46
Who would have been some of the key players there?
1:08:49
Oh, Jack Lattin, Andy Moldenke, Gary Parsons was a student of
1:08:57
Jack’s and is still helping us with beetle identifications.
1:09:03
Dave Lightfoot did a lot of the orthopteran.
1:09:06
He’s down at University of New Mexico now.
1:09:09
There’s a number of people who have done a lot of work in putting
1:09:13
the species list together and a habitat affinities and what not.
1:09:21
That’s been very valuable.
1:09:22
Then there were a number of publications on the small
1:09:26
mammals of the Pacific Northwest.
1:09:30
You have good distributional data.
1:09:34
You could put together the community that ought to be in
1:09:37
an old-growth coniferous forest.
1:09:39
Did you ever read Donald Lawrence’s stuff?
1:09:43
That name’s familiar.
1:09:47
That’s off the record.
1:09:52
Capstone question: how would you say that scientific research here has affected our
1:09:58
understanding of ecological processes, disturbance ecology in particular?
1:10:06
I think Jerry Franklin when he was talking the other night kind of hit it.
1:10:11
The legacy part of the specifics in a particular area of whether there were
1:10:19
logs, what the preconditions were, whether it was a clearcut or not.
1:10:25
How old the trees were?
1:10:26
Was there a serendipitous nature of the timing of the eruption,
1:10:34
whether your trees were on the lee side of a slope or the front side?
1:10:41
All of the details, and it teaches you that the details matter and it
1:10:48
expands the universe of possible outcomes for a given disturbance.
1:10:57
The criticisms have been of some of the scien-teers that
1:11:02
Mount St. Helens was so unique.
1:11:06
It was a one-time event, hardly ever going to be repeated.
1:11:12
But the lesson of Mount St. Helens is that it is a one-time event, but it has
1:11:20
variations on a theme and, yes, if you could make the volcano erupt a thousand
1:11:26
times you would have a really good understanding of volcanic eruptions.
1:11:33
You’d have your baseline, your controls, and you could go through time.
1:11:35
That’s right.
1:11:35
Exactly.
1:11:36
You could have it erupt in May and in June and in July and
1:11:38
in August and you could have
1:11:42
it erupt at night or during the day and stuff, because the fact that it erupted
1:11:47
in the morning, it’s daytime, a lot of the nocturnal species are underground.
1:11:52
It got the daytime ones.
1:11:55
It could have happened the other way around.
1:11:57
It was really unique.
1:11:59
How do you think the rapid salvage logging that happened, especially in the private
1:12:05
zones, affected the ecology of the area, because it was just, they did it so
1:12:11
fast and so complete and they wanted to even do the Forest Service lands, but
1:12:14
they only got a little of that, right?
1:12:16
That’s right.
1:12:16
How would you say that affected the ecology, but even the science?
1:12:20
Well, certainly, I mean their mission is to grow trees.
1:12:26
It’s a big tree farm.
1:12:29
They were very effective at it.
1:12:32
They were able to salvage it and move on.
1:12:36
How did it affect the science?
1:12:37
Well, you would have liked to have had more larger areas
1:12:41
to examine; more replication.
1:12:45
Most of the Weyerhaeuser land was right in the main path of the blast
1:12:50
up to the northwest, so it was, you know, you could have used more land.
1:12:56
But I think we have a, you know the Monument itself covers a lot of the
1:13:02
topography and the disturbance zones.
1:13:06
If
1:13:08
you don’t mind, talk to me a little about the collaborative
1:13:12
dynamic that has developed here.
1:13:13
Obviously, we are here at the Pulse, which has been going on since year 1, I believe.
1:13:19
Just about, yeah.
1:13:20
Or a form of the Pulse.
1:13:21
It’s matured and gotten bigger and changed, but how would you say that
1:13:26
the collaborative dynamic that has happened here has affected what has
1:13:32
been done here scientifically, but also culturally in terms of the institutional
1:13:38
effort that Big Science can do?
1:13:41
Yeah, and that’s really, the collaboration of all these different groups and
1:13:47
individuals who donate their time and resources and urge their students to
1:13:53
work here, it’s critical to this sort of, the gestalt as well as the comprehensive
1:14:04
nature of this, because one person, if we could clone Charlie, it would be
1:14:11
much better off, but you have a lot of experts in different fields who contribute
1:14:17
their time and energy here and try to orchestrate that would take a huge amount
1:14:25
of effort and bureaucracy and funding.
1:14:29
But this has literally been done on a series of small grants and
1:14:34
small collaboration of volunteers.
1:14:36
The
1:14:40
value of this project is that it does cover everything, from plants to water
1:14:47
to wildlife to nutrient cycles in soils.
1:14:53
You would need a whole community to do that.
1:14:56
That’s really critical.
1:14:57
One person can’t do it all.
1:14:59
Ecology.
1:15:00
Although Charlie comes close.
1:15:01
Ecology as a science, or, really, I would say a gestalt of
1:15:06
sciences, as you used the word.
1:15:09
It’s kind of a humbling discipline, isn’t it?
1:15:12
Oh, it is.
1:15:13
It is!
1:15:14
In the sense of what you have to try to know, correct?
1:15:16
Exactly.
1:15:17
Exactly.
1:15:18
This was one of the things, too, that I was, and this is I believe where
1:15:24
being a student of someone like Jim MacMahon was really outstanding and a
1:15:30
benefit for both Charlie and myself and the other folks out of Utah State that
1:15:35
worked up here, is the first summer I was here I was out with Roger and
1:15:40
Larry, Larry Bliss and Roger del Moral, and these are outstanding botanists.
1:15:46
Larry was a fantastic ecophysiologist, and I could name almost every plant,
1:15:55
certainly to genus, a lot of them to species, but I knew what they were,
1:16:01
and I knew the lifestyles of perennials and annuals and things like that.
1:16:06
We were up and there’s a couple of, there’s a golden-mantled ground squirrel
1:16:10
and a yellow pine chipmunk running around, and these guys didn’t know what they were.
1:16:17
They didn’t know the difference between them.
1:16:19
They had no idea.
1:16:20
They were some sort of squirrel.
1:16:23
But, that was it.
1:16:25
It just didn’t register.
1:16:27
I always thought that that was really odd, that you would be so specialized
1:16:33
that you were kind of ignorant about everything outside of your specialty,
1:16:40
whereas MacMahon had always taught his students to embrace everything.
1:16:46
Yeah, you take soils classes.
1:16:49
You take aquatic classes, even though you’re working in deserts.
1:16:53
You take vegetation.
1:16:55
You know your plants.
1:16:56
You know your birds and things like this.
1:16:59
It was really a push to understand as much of nature
1:17:03
around you as you possibly could.
1:17:06
Well, I think it’s the ecosystem science as it’s developing the last
1:17:11
30, 40 years is a return to what I like to call Humboldtian holism.
1:17:17
There you go.
1:17:18
That old, when geography really kind of meant everything.
1:17:21
Yes, that’s right.
1:17:22
Humboldt obviously went around the world with his assistant, and
1:17:28
they try to describe everything.
1:17:30
Although that was in some ways an impossible venture if you ever try
1:17:34
to read about Humboldt’s attempt to write his grand opus called
1:17:39
The Cosmos, he couldn’t do it.
1:17:42
Of course, at the same time was the development of the modern disciplines.
1:17:45
You see this intellectual stove piping that’s happened ever since.
1:17:49
Right, right.
1:17:51
What you’re really saying is that I think that’s being inverted at least on some
1:17:56
level where you’re trying to combine the specialization, expertise, the evolution
1:18:01
of knowledge and methodologies with shall we say a glance back to the past.
1:18:07
Yep.
1:18:08
That’s quite true.
1:18:09
Does that make sense?
1:18:10
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1:18:11
That’s why I think Jim MacMahon and Jerry Franklin, those guys, Fred
1:18:15
Swanson, they’re really renaissance men.
1:18:19
They understand so much about a wide variety of things and can integrate
1:18:25
them and see how they fit together.
1:18:28
That is a rare talent.
1:18:31
It takes motivation and drive to quite that level of knowledge as well as
1:18:37
just an open mind to ask the question, “How does that influence that?”
1:18:44
It’s been a privilege to be associated with them for all these years up here.
1:18:48
Has the Pulse idea, as you see it here, unique in your experience?
1:18:54
I know there are other collective ventures.
1:18:55
It is.
1:18:56
But this seems to be a more sustained, committed venture.
1:19:00
It is.
1:19:00
Would that be true in your experience?
1:19:02
Yes, it is.
1:19:05
So, I’ve been involved 14 ½, 15 years with this Sevilleta LTER program
1:19:11
and other LTERs along the way.
1:19:14
Those are continuous and now the NEON operation [National Ecological Observatory
1:19:20
Network] , I’ve been involved with developing that and being reviewer
1:19:23
for NSF and whatnot for the program.
1:19:26
Those are kind of the epitome of juggernaut type science
1:19:32
program to give long-term data.
1:19:35
The
1:19:38
Pulses here were an absolutely brilliant idea by Charlie and Jerry
1:19:43
and Fred to provide large numbers of data sets every 5 years, knowing that
1:19:53
this is a very long-term process.
1:19:57
We’re in this successional process for 100 years yet to come.
1:20:04
Keeping everything up every 5 years to kind of reinvigorate and update the
1:20:08
databases and also to find out which ones are not being paid attention to, which
1:20:14
ones do we have to step up and cover.
1:20:19
Logistically, intellectually, comradery fashioned, this is definitely an
1:20:26
absolute brilliant idea to do this.
1:20:28
How do you like the fact that last maybe 10, 15 years the arts and the
1:20:33
humanities have been brought in?
1:20:35
It’s been fun, yeah!
1:20:37
What does that do for you as
1:20:42
a, there’s no such thing as a pure science, but as a science guy.
1:20:46
What does that, when there’s writers and artists and poets and this thing is
1:20:50
going on where the traditional science community is, I won’t say challenged,
1:20:55
but it seeing a different lens, or seeing it through a little bit different lens?
1:21:01
I think what it does is it gives scientists pause to say, okay, yeah
1:21:06
you guys come back here and think the poem, they respected the mountain, but
1:21:12
now they love the mountain after it showed its awesome power and what not.
1:21:17
That’s an interesting concept.
1:21:18
You just kind of say, yeah, these things
1:21:25
have kind of beautiful, intrinsic values.
1:21:29
I look at a landscape like this and say, whoa, okay I’m looking at 800
1:21:38
trees per hectare per acre here and that’s x amount of nitrogen and I can
1:21:45
just imagine the phosphorous cycling in here and the huge amount of diversity
1:21:49
in these things and what not, but an artist sees it as a beautiful landscape.
1:21:56
It reminds us that, hey, we can look at this in a number of different ways.
1:22:00
You and I, for the record, we’re sitting here on a logging road.
1:22:06
Yep, an old logging road.
1:22:07
And we’re looking across the valley at Mt. Rainier, the
1:22:11
grand mountain of the Northwest.
1:22:11
That’s right.
1:22:13
There’s lots of glaciers and snow all over it.
1:22:17
I’ll use that to frame one of my last questions, this is what you consider
1:22:22
a traditional alpine aesthetic.
1:22:26
The traditional grand beauty of a beautiful mountain.
1:22:31
How would you characterize aesthetics and beauty applied to the
1:22:35
mountain that we can’t see on the other side of the hill, Mount St.
1:22:38
Helens, and all that surrounds it?
1:22:41
Well, the beauty of Mount St. Helens is it shows geologic processes in our lifetime.
1:22:48
You know, you go in a mountain range and you know this took millions
1:22:53
of years to build up and what not, and it’s shaped by geologic events,
1:22:58
but Mount St. Helens occurred, the eruption occurred in a timeframe
1:23:02
that we can understand and absorb.
1:23:05
It’s
1:23:08
great to see these examples of geologic change happening right before our eyes.
1:23:16
That’s the beauty of that.
1:23:20
It’s not static.
1:23:22
I look at Mt. Rainier and I realize the science tells me yes that has been a
1:23:27
volcano that’s erupted a lot of times.
1:23:29
It’s built up that mountain here, but it’s still static.
1:23:35
It isn’t moving and stuff like that.
1:23:36
You look at Mount St. Helens, every time I look at it, it’s a dynamo.
1:23:41
It’s dynamic.
1:23:43
It’s moving.
1:23:45
It’s developing.
1:23:46
It’s in motion through time.
1:23:51
What would you say the most important scientific lesson that you
1:23:55
have learned at Mount St. Helens?
1:23:59
Well, just the rates of turnover of different groups of species and how
1:24:05
to use natural history to explain that and, secondly, the landscape diversity
1:24:12
of a single disturbance event has created so many environments that have
1:24:17
collectively given you a landscape diversity that greatly exceeds what would
1:24:23
have been here, if it hadn’t erupted.
1:24:27
You know through time it’s essentially this has been the
1:24:31
story of the Cascades all along.
1:24:34
It’s a dynamic equilibrium of these patches show up spatially
1:24:42
across the whole mountain range.
1:24:43
How would you best synopsize or encapsulate your history and role here
1:24:48
at this mountain at the Pulse studying the mountain over 33 years now, correct?
1:24:55
Yeah.
1:24:56
So, I guess my role is, again, working with the insects, a little
1:25:02
bit with nutrient cycling, helping Charlie with the small mammal work
1:25:06
and helping get those early grants to get the whole thing started.
1:25:13
Because it does take money.
1:25:14
It does take money.
1:25:15
That’s right.
1:25:16
You’ve got to be there and be willing to do it and be interested in it.
1:25:23
That’s been pretty good, and I like following along with the insect
1:25:28
work, because it’s so diverse, again, Roger has 150 species of plants;
1:25:34
I’ve got over 450 species of beetles.
1:25:37
For every plant, there’s a couple of specialist insects plus the omnivores
1:25:43
and predators and parasitoids and pollinators and everything else.
1:25:46
It’s a good group to work with, and I’m glad to see more and more students are
1:25:53
interested in different aspects of this.
1:25:56
This is a much more diverse environment than what you see around the central
1:26:01
area of the volcano, correct?
1:26:04
Yes, so we’re basically the insects that have come in and established and
1:26:10
are looking for these microhabitats that the volcano has created.
1:26:15
New niches, right?
1:26:16
Yeah, along those lines.
1:26:18
They
1:26:22
exist in little tiny spots here and there and they’ve gotten very good through
1:26:27
evolutionary time and dispersing and finding similar spots and surviving.
1:26:36
If you wanted to say one last thing about Mount St. Helens, the Pulse this year,
1:26:42
anything about the experience here you want to kind of give a capstone statement?
1:26:48
Well, I feel real privileged to have worked with the people that have been
1:26:53
here, the leaders over the years and the ability to come up and have long-term
1:27:02
studies going on and Charlie and all his numerous people that have kept
1:27:09
the program alive up here, because I know how much effort it takes just
1:27:14
in running my program in New Mexico.
1:27:17
This is even bigger than that.
1:27:23
It’s been a pleasure working with all these people and keeping the
1:27:27
data stream coming, so we learn more every time we come up here.
1:27:32
Sounds good.
1:27:32
I appreciate your time.
1:27:35
My pleasure, thanks Sam!
1:27:37
Appreciate it.
1:27:37
You bet.
