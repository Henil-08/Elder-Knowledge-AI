00:02
Good morning, this is Dr. Samuel Schmieding.
00:05
I am here at the Forest Ecosystems & Society Department,
00:08
Oregon State University.
00:10
I am here in the home of Dr. Frederick J. Swanson, emeritus scientist, U.S.
00:16
Forest Service, in his Corvallis home.
00:18
We are going to do probably the first of two or three oral history
00:24
interviews covering his work and experience with Mount St. Helens.
00:29
Good morning, Fred.
00:30
Good morning.
00:32
Okay.
00:33
Let’s just start right away with
00:38
when did you first become interested in geology and volcanoes?
00:43
How did this interest evolve into what became a professional pursuit and passion?
00:51
As I was growing up in the East Coast, I would visit
00:58
my grandparents, on my mother’s side, in Janesville, Wisconsin,
01:02
where my grandfather was part of the Janesville Sand & Gravel Company.
01:06
There was a geological connection, a company that quarried fluvial,
01:11
glacial outwash in southern Wisconsin for construction.
01:21
On my father’s side, he grew up in a mining town in the
01:23
northern peninsula of Michigan.
01:27
When we’d go visit there, we’d go see people in that town, see their
01:33
rock collections, and he’d take me out to waste piles from different
01:38
mines and we’d collect minerals.
01:41
My dad would take me fossil hunting at times, and, so, I had
01:45
some geology roots back as a boy.
01:53
I was sort of science oriented in high school.
01:55
I did go to Penn State to be a geology major, although I didn’t know much
02:00
at all about what geology was because I had no exposure to it in K-12.
02:11
I just sort of stuck with it all the way through until I got
02:17
enveloped in ecosystem stuff.
02:23
I did get to go to Mount St. Helens, a family trip, in I think it was 1962.
02:29
I remember we didn’t get to see the mountain because the cloud cover
02:36
enshrouded the upper part, but we went to the timberline parking lot and went across
02:44
Spirit Lake to the Harmony Falls Lodge and had a family style meal, and then walked
02:53
back along the shores of Spirit Lake.
02:55
My father gave me a few photos from that experience.
03:01
That sort of set the stage.
03:03
As a grad student, I went to the Galapagos with a team of 7 graduate students.
03:11
We got a National Science Foundation interdisciplinary research grant and
03:17
for $35,000 we took some students.
03:21
We did projects in volcanic history, plant ecology, and seismology and ended
03:30
up with a couple very nice publications.
03:36
That really got me launched in volcano ecology, I think, although I
03:41
didn’t do that for my dissertation.
03:43
It was a side interest.
03:46
You gave me the nice little story there about visiting Mount St. Helens and I may
03:50
ask you a question later about aesthetics and perception of the perfect symmetrical
03:55
cone versus what it is now, but going back even earlier about reading books
04:02
on geology or volcanoes: what were your earliest memories, from either in-person
04:06
experience, readings, photographs, or art about volcanoes and eruptions
04:10
that informed your original concepts and/or visualizations of volcanoes and
04:17
volcanism?
04:18
Well, I don’t really have any specific memories.
04:22
Like I say, I was growing up on the east coast, and, so, they weren’t a part of my
04:28
local landscape, whereas here in Oregon, living in Oregon or visiting Colorado, for
04:35
example, I’ve always really appreciated being able to see the mountains,
04:41
although they might be 60 miles away.
04:44
Every day when I go out on my bike ride along the agricultural lands south
04:49
of Corvallis, I love looking over and seeing the Three Sisters or Jefferson.
04:56
I don’t have any specific memories of volcanoes.
05:01
You don’t remember reading a book, for instance, like history, Roman history,
05:05
where they always have a chapter on Pompeii, for instance, and Vesuvius.
05:12
They recreate what they thought it was like, for instance.
05:15
I don’t really remember that.
05:17
I wasn’t a big reader.
05:18
Okay.
05:21
So, going to the second question that couples to the when did you first become
05:28
interested in geology and volcanoes, when did you first become interested in
05:32
ecology and ecological processes, and how did this interest evolve into what became
05:37
later a professional pursuit and passion?
05:40
Well, when I was a kid through fourth grade, my family was living in Bon
05:48
Air, which was then a little village outside of Richmond, Virginia.
05:52
It’s now been enveloped in Richmond suburbia.
05:56
I had a friend named Wendell Gaddis, who was a very much an animal sort of guy.
06:04
I remember their family had a de-stunk skunk in their menagerie
06:11
and they had dogs and so forth.
06:15
Wendell and I would go out in the forest, the cutover forest, or down to some
06:22
creeks and go exploring for animals and finding box turtles in the woods.
06:30
I remember a period when they were very active.
06:32
We would just go stand quietly in the woods and listen for them rustling
06:36
through the leaves and go find them.
06:41
I remember liking that sort of animal stuff and the environment,
06:47
and just playing outside in those early elementary school days.
06:52
Did you ever happen to read one of Rachel Carson’s famous early books
06:56
for the common person on ecology?
07:00
I don’t remember getting exposed to those sorts of things through reading.
07:05
I’m not remembering much in the way of TV shows or movies.
07:12
It’s quite interesting.
07:12
Our family just watched some of the David Attenborough Planet Earth videos just
07:20
in the last couple of days, and Julia just ordered a few more for Gareth.
07:26
He’ll turn 18 in a few days and he’s very interested in animals and he
07:33
was just commenting on how important that these visual and fascinating
07:41
stories sustained his interest.
07:46
We go to a pond that’s been in Julia’s family with dwellings, it’s been in
07:55
Julia’s family for about 90 years and Gareth just goes out there and he’s
08:00
just looking for turtles and salamanders
08:06
and doing fishing just for the opportunity to connect with the ecosystem.
08:13
Anyway, it’s interesting to watch him, because he’s having more
08:17
intense interactions of that sort with nature than I had had
08:22
through high school, for example.
08:33
The time that you visited Mount St. Helens in 1962 would have been the
08:37
first time you were up close and personal with the volcano, even though
08:41
you couldn’t see the top, correct?
08:43
Yes, that’s true.
08:46
Okay.
08:48
Do you remember just a sense of just mainly nature more than anything, rather
08:53
than any specific thing about this is a volcano or something like that?
08:57
Well, I was intrigued by it.
09:00
I was just out of high school.
09:01
I didn’t have any formal geological training to fit things into.
09:08
I do remember that tree wells were a safety concern.
09:16
As you went down close to Spirit Lake on the north length of the volcano
09:23
where mudflows or pyroclastic flows had come down into forest and knocked down
09:33
the forest, but had buried its lower extremities and then the trees died
09:42
and rotted out and left these wells which were sort of a safety hazard.
09:47
We went down close to the shores of Spirit Lake because there was an old crank type
09:53
telephone on a tree that you called over to the Harmony Falls Lodge across the lake
10:01
and ordered your meal and asked them to come pick you up in a little motorboat.
10:07
Anyway, and I
10:11
had that sense of being in a subalpine environment with short-statured
10:20
vegetation, which was still responding to the eruption from
10:25
around 1800, which was the subject matter of D.B. Lawrence’s work,
10:32
before and leading up to the WWII period.
10:36
Right.
10:37
I’ve read some things that he wrote and even photographs he took that were I
10:41
think even from the ‘20s and ‘30s, right?
10:43
Yeah, at least the ‘30s.
10:48
So, based on the fact you grew up in the east, you couldn’t see St. Helens,
10:52
was the Galapagos trip your first real hands-on touching with overt
11:00
volcanism?
11:00
Yes, in a way it was.
11:02
In advance of that the two other geology guys that went, Jaroslav Lexa, a
11:10
visiting geologist from Czechoslovakia, visiting the University of Oregon
11:16
Geology Department and Center for Volcanology, and Hartmut Wolfgang Baitis,
11:24
who was a beginning Ph.D. student.
11:27
The three of us traveled over to Hawaii to the Big Island, which
11:34
was where Kilauea was in eruption.
11:38
We went over there as sort of training and warming up.
11:43
It was fascinating because we got to go out with a USGS geologist
11:50
and peer over the edge of
11:55
crater rim where there was an active lava lake bubbling that was then
12:00
draining out through some lava tubes.
12:02
We could
12:06
see active lava flows, including flow into the sea and this lava lake, and
12:13
also look at the various features.
12:16
That was the closest,
12:21
that was one close encounter with volcanism, and active volcanism.
12:26
Also, by the time of our Galapagos trip, which was around 1970,
12:36
I’d been a graduate student at University of Oregon since ’67, so
12:46
I’d been in the Cascades and had some exposure to volcanology and hiked
12:54
up in the High Cascades and so I’d seen very youthful volcanic features.
13:00
Both the Cascades and the Hawaii experiences.
13:02
What specific experiences did you have in the Cascades?
13:06
Which volcanoes, what areas?
13:09
I don’t remember the particulars of the timing, but I’m quite sure I’ve
13:13
been into the Three Sisters area.
13:15
There was Sunshine Shelter we’d gone on a geology trip with Alexander “Mac”
13:20
McBirney, who was the lead of the volcanology program at the University
13:27
of Oregon, and so we’d been around the Three Sisters, for example. I remember
13:36
somewhere in there climbing Hood
13:41
and Middle Sister and almost to the top of North Sister and a winter climb
13:50
with Jaroslav Lexa to Three Finger Jack. It was sort of wild, sort of
13:57
blizzardy conditions, and we didn’t have snowshoes, so we slogged our way in there.
14:03
I remember coming out my beard, which was large then, large enough
14:09
I could put it in a ponytail, it had ice and snow condensed and frozen,
14:22
because I was breathing and the moisture from my breath would
14:25
condense on my beard and then freeze.
14:27
If I turned my head sideways it would sort of go “clunk” because it wasn’t
14:31
frozen all the way against my skin because of the warmth of my face.
14:35
Anyway, that was fun trip. It wasn’t very volcanological, but it was an adventure.
14:41
What
14:43
did you learn at Penn State about volcanology?
14:47
More book learning, I would take it, correct?
14:49
Yeah, I don’t really remember learning anything much [about
14:56
volcanoes] . I did feel that I got a good geological background.
15:06
Penn State, east coast, a big center for coal research.
15:11
Coal was big in Pennsylvania.
15:13
It was called College of Mineral, may have been Geology and Mineral Industries.
15:21
Mineral industries were a big part of the title.
15:25
So, economic geology was a much more important track, for instance, than
15:30
shall we say theoretical geology?
15:34
The applied?
15:35
Yeah.
15:36
The applied to the mineral realm was a big part of the whole college.
15:44
Volcanoes were far away.
15:46
I did have some great experiences that were I think seminal in my
15:52
interdisciplinary instincts down the road, including geology-ecology interactions,
16:00
and possibly even with the arts and humanities that’s really picked up in
16:04
the last 15 years for me personally.
16:06
But
16:09
after my freshman year, a professor Robert F. Schmalz who was my advisor
16:15
and instructor in historical geology and general geology as a freshman,
16:22
arranged so that I could go to the Bermuda Biological Station.
16:27
As a beginning undergraduate running some little experiments and also sit in on some
16:34
of the activities of a graduate student class on organism-sediment relationships
16:41
in a modern environment of calcium carbonate deposition, which is really the
16:48
stuff ultimately of petroleum geology.
16:54
It had
16:58
near-shore marine ecologists, geologists, and seawater chemistry people.
17:06
That was far removed from volcanism, but it was highly interdisciplinary, and I
17:12
thought it was just very cool and it was literally an immersive experience, because
17:18
a lot of times we were in the water.
17:21
It was very neat.
17:23
Was that experience in Hawaii, was that the kind of first shall we say visceral,
17:32
strong visual aesthetic immersion of what a volcano looks like and lava?
17:40
Or did you have other things that had been competing with it?
17:42
Well, I’d seen movies and
17:48
seen textbook stuff about volcanoes, but yes that was the
17:52
first, wow, this is for real.
17:55
Red hot.
17:56
You’ve got to be careful.
17:57
It’s dangerous.
17:59
A lava tube roof could collapse.
18:02
As we looked over the edge of this crater at the lava lake the USGS geologist
18:08
stationed a couple of us looking at the cracks, down the cracks of blocks
18:17
that could spall off and cave into the lake, so we could warn our compatriots
18:25
who were over at the edge, if we were seeing some orange lava appear in a
18:31
crack, it might signal immanent collapse.
18:37
It was an important and exciting experience.
18:41
How did your impressions and sophistication in your understanding
18:47
of volcanoes and the different kinds of volcanism actions and eruptions, how did
18:52
that evolve from that particular time?
18:54
You can include the Galapagos as well in that.
19:01
Well, I was from textbook learning and some classroom learning becoming aware
19:07
of the different styles of volcanism, like the Cascades chain versus oceanic
19:18
island volcanism and fluidity of the basaltic lavas in Hawaii
19:26
and then Galapagos setting.
19:30
I was learning about all that.
19:37
It’s interesting to note that when I was an undergraduate at Penn State ’62-’66,
19:46
plate tectonics, which is the framework within which to view volcanism globally
19:54
was being debated and just emerging.
19:58
It was post WWII when it really became the paradigm, right, or
20:01
gradually became the paradigm?
20:02
Well, the first half of the ‘60s was when it really
20:07
took off and things like the magnetic striping in the sea floor
20:14
was being detected.
20:15
It was the Cold War period and a lot of geophysical research in the marine
20:22
environment was motivated by Cold War issues and was supported by the Office
20:31
of Naval Research and that was critical in the revelation of sea floor spreading.
20:39
A of the early ecology in the ‘40s and ‘50s of that era took place in,
20:44
shall we say, radiated space, where they would see how radiation would
20:49
move through the ecosystem, correct?
20:52
Right, that did help
20:57
with some of the early support for ecosystem science.
21:02
Places like
21:05
Luquillo [Puerto Rico] , which is now Long-Term Ecological Research
21:11
program and the Luquillo Experimental Forest and also at Oak Ridge.
21:24
If you were going to characterize your understanding of volcanoes pre-1980 and
21:29
St. Helens, how would you characterize your intellectual universe going into
21:39
1980?
21:39
Start with geology and volcanism first and then transition into
21:43
ecology and ecological processes.
21:47
On the geology front,
21:51
the experiences of Hawaii and some of the Cascades, including the mapping assignment
22:01
at the Andrews Forest, so I began working at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in
22:06
1972 just as I completed my Ph.D. degree.
22:11
The first job at the Andrews in ’72 was to work with Mike James in mapping the
22:17
geology of the Andrews Forest, which is obscured by so much forest cover.
22:28
But it’s all volcanic material of various sorts: lava flows, pyroclastic flows,
22:36
lahars/mudflows, dikes, and sedimentary rocks of exclusively volcanic origin.
22:47
I was interested in the experience from the Galapagos and experiences
22:53
from the High Cascades, the Young Cascades, as opportunities
22:59
to see modern environments of
23:03
volcanic landforms, to view primary volcanic landforms, whereas the
23:10
Andrews Forest is deeply eroded.
23:14
Volcanic geology is very complex and, if it’s old, if it’s an old, deeply eroded
23:23
forest shrouded, 99% forest-covered landscape, it’s really tough to
23:31
make good sense out of the bedrock.
23:34
Anyway, I’d had all these kinds of experiences leading up to
23:38
1980 on the geology front.
23:41
On the ecology front, and as I write about a little bit in the document
23:47
that I sent you this morning,
23:51
I sort of outline how the decade of the ‘70s, that is right before
23:58
the eruption of Mount St. Helens in the International Biological
24:01
Program era of the Andrews Forest
24:05
and with some of our collaborators of the Seattle part of the Coniferous
24:12
Forest Biome [the Andrews was the Oregon hub of the Coniferous Forest Biome
24:21
under the International Biological Program], we had the decade of the
24:27
‘70s to work together across forest, lakes, streams, in the ecology realm
24:37
and then the geophysical processes and landforms on which the forest, stream,
24:44
and lake ecosystems are performing.
24:49
We had a decade to develop our concepts of how that world works and over
24:56
different timescales and different special scales and to develop personal
25:01
relationships, and, in a bunch of cases, to publish together and find a shared
25:07
vocabulary across our disciplines.
25:12
I think that that experience of the ‘70s, especially in the ecosystem
25:19
front, which included the geology, geophysical processes background all
25:28
positioned us incredibly well to launch on this new stage of Mount St. Helens.
25:38
It was hugely important.
25:40
Some of the first things that we did under the leadership of Jerry Franklin
25:46
were to help get members of the ecology community in there, in the summer of 1980.
25:56
This would have been in the one month or so after the big blow, right?
26:01
Which was May 18th, correct?
26:06
Correct.
26:06
I don’t know if you’re ready for me to start going into that
26:09
earliest history of interaction.
26:11
Let’s do a little more prep before we go in too deep, but we’re on the edge, yeah.
26:20
Yeah.
26:20
I’ve been very amazed to reflect on my own career, but that’s
26:24
also the career of community, members in the community in toto.
26:32
We had the luxury of so many years in IBP in the ‘70s.
26:40
Basically, in training for what you didn’t know was going to happen, correct?
26:45
Correct.
26:46
There was tremendous importance and impact that we couldn’t anticipate
26:52
off in the realm of forestry, policy and practices, and so forth, regional
26:59
and ultimately global perception of old forests and stuff like that that
27:04
occurred from that decade of the
27:08
‘70s, based more at the Andrews and satellite sites and out of
27:14
the Seattle group’s work in places like the Cedar River Watershed.
27:23
But, it also trained us, prepared us, for moving out of the green forest and the
27:32
blue waters of places like the Andrews Forest into the gray landscape of the
27:39
immediate post-eruption case at Mount St. Helens and for me, as a geoscientist
27:48
who liked working with ecoscientists,
27:54
it was just totally unbelievable that this geo-eco interaction would come
28:03
together with such a bang on May 18th.
28:09
It was just so amazing.
28:11
For me then I could also push some of my relationships with geologist colleagues,
28:18
particularly Dick Janda, a USGS geologist,
28:25
into this new space of the volcano realm.
28:29
Dick Janda was quite senior to me and he led a forest geomorphology project out
28:39
of the Menlo Office of the USGS, Menlo Park, California, in the Bay Area in the
28:46
Redwood Creek Country and his project had to do with the effects of logging
28:53
and natural processes on erosion and in that highly erosive north coastal
29:00
California landscape in the context, the highly charged political context,
29:05
of the establishment and subsequent expansion of Redwood National Park.
29:12
Dick saw me as an ally, and I picked up on stuff he was doing and applied
29:19
it in the Andrews, and he was on the advisory committee for the Andrews
29:23
Forest for a while and we have long-term stream cross-section measurement arrays
29:34
that were begun at Dick’s recommendation in the late ‘70s.
29:38
He envisioned Redwood Creek, Andrews Forest, maybe the Elk and Sixes
29:46
River country in the coastal area, down near Cape Blanco in Port Orford
29:51
where I did my Ph.D. work, and possibly the Bull Run Watershed,
29:59
the water supply for the city of Portland.
30:01
Dick envisioned these sites as these major hubs for forest geomorphology research.
30:12
Then Dick got deeply involved with Mount St. Helens and he was instrumental
30:16
in me being able to go in there with
30:22
a group of 4 on May 28th, day 10, which was on a USGS supported trip.
30:29
That’s very interesting that you’re in the Andrews, which is a certain
30:32
kind of landscape, but if you
30:38
look over at the Three Sisters and the more youthful volcanic area and
30:44
you’re kind of looking at your future, and not knowing it though, right?
30:48
That’s true and then the landscape that Mount St. Helens eruption created,
30:54
especially with the giant debris avalanche, all the ponds, Spirit Lake
30:59
and the new lakes of Coldwater and Castle, and the variety of processes.
31:09
That hugely informed me about what modern environments of deposition look like and
31:20
where I might be seeing ancient examples in the bedrock of the Andrews Forest.
31:28
A connection between modern volcanism and ancient volcanism has to do with
31:35
all the lessons you can learn when you have a naked landscape, and everything
31:40
is fresh right there in front of you.
31:42
It helps you to make your interpretations when you go back and
31:45
get these really tiny little windows into the past, these small outcrops
31:53
looking at millions of years into the past.
31:56
You’re constantly wanting to tune your eye for interpretation of the
32:02
ancient by looking at the modern.
32:05
Now, going back to early 1980, Mount St. Helens starts to puff and show
32:13
signs that it’s waking up in March.
32:18
Were there plans in motion or discussions that we should maybe be ready to send
32:25
a team up there, or did that only happen after the big bang of May 18th?
32:33
On one hand,
32:37
we’ve done some planning for LTER.
32:40
We turned in a proposal, which was funded in 1980 and
32:47
incredibly remarkably
32:52
LTER [Long-term Ecological Research Program] and Mount St.
32:55
Helens both commenced in 1980.
32:59
It was a wild year.
33:04
It’s been a wild ride ever since.
33:06
I liken it to sort of surfing a tsunami.
33:10
Here were two
33:14
tsunamis.
33:14
One was the old-growth battles and the other was Mount St. Helens.
33:19
As I will convey later in the interview, and you can see in the Crisafulli,
33:27
et al, volcano ecology chapter in the new edition of the encyclopedia
33:34
of volcanoes, Mount St. Helens has a very distinctive place in the global
33:41
picture of volcano ecology research.
33:47
Anyway, it’s just unbelievable that these things had happened.
33:50
In the context of planning long-term ecological research in general, one
33:55
wonders how we have preparedness for the big disaster, big disturbance,
34:01
that’s bound to occur, whether it’s a big fire or windstorm in a place like
34:07
the Andrews or a volcanic eruption.
34:11
Or, the obvious one here would be a major slip in the Cascadia
34:15
subduction and causing major tsunami.
34:19
Yes, subduction zone earthquake would be another thing.
34:23
These types of events that have
34:29
50-, several-hundred recurrence intervals.
34:33
They’re totally expectable, but you can’t predict them as to when they occur.
34:38
A complete segue, but I’m just curious about what happened—has
34:42
there been any substantial ecological research in the Indian Ocean area
34:50
or even in Japan about the ecology?
34:52
Have they been more concerned with disaster response and getting the
34:57
human societies back up and running?
35:03
I am not aware of it, but I am not tracking research in those settings.
35:09
However, I do think I have seen some indication that, especially
35:16
in the Indian Ocean case,
35:22
that the presence of natural vegetation, like mangroves, can
35:26
help mitigate some of the impacts.
35:30
Let’s see, you had a question that I was going to go back to, which is
35:34
did we prepare to go to Mount St. Helens after it started puffing.
35:42
I do not remember any preparation from the Corvallis scene.
35:51
I just think
35:57
my guess is that we didn’t think there was anything we could really do.
36:02
I didn’t really, in the first month, I didn’t really expect anything big.
36:07
Once the bulge really started growing, then it looked like
36:10
something [SS interrupts]
36:11
. Big might happen.
36:11
Yeah.
36:14
On the other hand, as I mention, some of the limnology people I think
36:20
scurried in there and got some, what turned out to be pre-eruption data.
36:27
They were dealing with the components of the ecosystem that
36:32
had the potential to undergo abrupt
36:37
change and then change quickly thereafter
36:43
and that they could go in and make some measurements rather quickly.
36:50
I think we were mostly awestruck and viewing it from a distance.
36:57
So, March, April, and then leading up to May you were watching it and
37:02
of course everybody that knew geology saw the bulge as a very ominous sign.
37:08
But still you really weren’t prepared for how incredibly powerful
37:16
and gigantic this eruption was.
37:20
That’s true.
37:20
Even the experts, such as Barry Voight, who was a Penn State prof
37:27
and on what’s called WAE or “when actually engaged” status with USGS
37:34
because he’d been a big landslide specialist and also interested in
37:47
volcanism, he was enlisted by USGS to help. They had a bunch of the
37:52
world’s experts stationed right there in the Vancouver area and they were
38:00
doing their work on the volcano.
38:03
Mount St. Helens is so incredibly well-known because the world’s experts
38:13
were at the foot of the volcano when it blew up and could immediately go in and
38:20
make all kinds of observations from the get-go, including making measurements
38:27
of the temperature of the deposits when they were only a few days old.
38:31
Was David Johnston the only one that was killed, though, the only
38:33
scientist, or were there others?
38:36
I think he was the only scientist.
38:44
You and your colleagues were mostly just watching and obviously the USGS
38:52
scientists were closer.
38:54
They were in Vancouver, or like in David Johnston’s case right
38:57
there by the mountain doing their active monitoring, correct?
39:00
Yeah.
39:01
But ecosystem scientists weren’t like preparing a plan to study.
39:06
You just basically reacted after the big blast happened, correct?
39:10
That’s my recollection.
39:12
It’d be good to ask Jerry how he was thinking about it.
39:16
There
39:23
were interesting goings on and sort of competition for access and the
39:34
State of Washington, under Dixy Lee Ray, the governor, had an interesting
39:39
set of dealings and declared a
39:45
zone to restrict access for public safety.
39:50
The red zone, right?
39:51
Yeah.
39:52
A lot of that is described in this new book by Richard Waite.
39:57
This is the one from Washington State University Press?
39:59
Yeah, In the Path of Destruction: Eyewitness Chronicles of Mount St. Helens.
40:04
There’s a lot of description in there
40:09
of the circumstances.
40:11
Academics
40:15
wanted to get in and USGS people had their access systems and I think there was some
40:23
turf – bureaucratic and other kinds of turf wars, especially in geo circles.
40:31
There’s concern about
40:36
giving technical information to the public and how should that proceed.
40:43
This is pre-eruption?
40:46
Yes.
40:47
Or, pre, during, and after.
40:50
There’s an interesting book, which I used to have, I can’t find it anymore—Volcano
40:57
Cowboys, in which each chapter is about a different eruption and it’s told by
41:08
I think it was a Time magazine reporter who has some colorful descriptions.
41:13
I think he went out with USGS guys to the tavern and got some stories that some
41:20
of them wish had not been put in print.
41:25
But
41:31
a key issue there is that the
41:36
USGS approach is to provide information to local officials.
41:41
For safety concerns more than anything correct?
41:43
Then [for them] to make decisions about communicating with the public.
41:49
They’ve had to do this in various settings around the world as a
41:53
consequence of their Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, which was born
41:57
after the eruption of Mount St. Helens.
42:01
That’s a whole other story that I shouldn’t be the one to go into.
42:08
It’s described in interesting ways and there were some National Academy of
42:12
Sciences, National Research Council
42:17
studies and reports on the Volcano Hazards Program of USGS, which is a very
42:24
interesting story and has had powerful and important positive influences in many
42:31
countries around the world which have to deal with volcanoes and states of unrest.
42:36
Regarding the first trip in there of ecologists, 10 days after, correct?
42:45
The trip I went on I was the only person who was ecologically
42:50
oriented, but it was only 4 people.
42:53
It was a USGS [SS interrupts]
42:54
. This was the helicopter in trip and things were still warm?
42:58
Yes.
43:02
There were muddy geysers on the shore of Spirit Lake.
43:08
There was volcanic tremor and there were
43:13
splatters [of tephra-laden raindrops] on the screen of the helicopter
43:19
and it was very interesting and exciting.
43:24
Since we’re there, let’s get right into it.
43:26
You get in the helicopter with 4 other people and the pilot?
43:30
Three other people and the pilot.
43:32
There were Barry Voight, who was the Penn State professor who had
43:39
done some instruction in a field course that I had taken when I was
43:43
an undergraduate at Penn State.
43:46
A guy named Ray Wells, who had been a grad student at the University
43:50
of Oregon at the time I was there.
43:53
He was a cool guy.
43:55
He went on to have a career with USGS.
43:58
Harry Glicken, who was field assistant to David Johnston.
44:05
He had been stationed on May 17th at the site where David Johnston’s camp was.
44:17
The camp consisted of a camper and maybe a tent and a pickup.
44:26
David Johnston took over for Harry the night of May 17th so Harry
44:30
could go down to town and do his laundry and meet with a prospective
44:36
grad student advisor, and David Johnston took over and then
44:41
was killed the next morning.
44:45
Harry was enlisted to help look for David Johnston’s camp in the first
44:53
few days [after the eruption] , maybe even on the afternoon of May 18th.
45:00
Then he went on this trip and Barry Voight had been to that camp.
45:06
We spent a little bit of our helicopter time looking for it.
45:10
But we also were making geological observations along what became known
45:15
as Johnston’s Ridge and at the north end of the west arm of Spirit Lake.
45:22
Our mission was to try to figure out whether the blast or the giant
45:27
landslide reached those sites first.
45:33
Harry seemed like he still had, you know, he was still traumatized and may have
45:40
been partly suffering survivor’s guilt.
45:45
It was quite amazing that then he completed his Ph.D. on
45:50
the giant landslide deposit.
45:53
Of St. Helens?
45:54
At St. Helens at University of California Santa Cruz, I think it was.
45:59
Then he went over to Japan and was studying similar deposits from big
46:06
volcanoes resulting from sector collapse of big volcanos over there.
46:11
He was looking for a way to get back to the U.S. I remember he called me
46:15
up one time in the context of a search that was going on for a new faculty
46:20
member in geology at OSU, Oregon State.
46:27
But then he went out with three other people, a Japanese scientist and the
46:32
Kraffts, a French couple that made movies of eruptions and they went out
46:39
to Mount Unzen volcano and they were killed in a pyroclastic flow there.
46:45
He dodged the bullet at St. Helens, but was then killed.
46:49
David Johnston had dodged a bullet as described in this book by Richard
46:54
Waite up at an Alaska volcano.
46:57
Redoubt?
46:58
Yeah.
47:00
He—I think it was Redoubt.
47:02
He
47:10
lived to tell the story there, but then was killed at St. Helens.
47:15
Anyway, the four of us went in and we made a few stops and
47:21
it was just a totally amazing and overwhelming experience.
47:26
Where did you take off from?
47:27
Where was the original helipad, the location?
47:30
Vancouver or?
47:32
I think it was Pearson Airstrip in Vancouver.
47:38
I remember we went out to, it may have been Woodland, for refueling.
47:46
Helicopters, I think it was an AStar, and I think it only had a few hours of fuel
47:55
capacity and I think we were in the very early days you needed to keep the rotor
48:04
going in case there was more eruptive activity and you had to boogie on out.
48:10
That was the rule, though, of going into the red zone?
48:13
Yeah.
48:13
Was it still called the red zone after the eruption?
48:16
It was, yeah.
48:16
Okay, so to be able to go in there you had to continue to have the rotors
48:22
going so you could quickly escape?
48:24
Yeah.
48:26
As you’re going from Vancouver to Woodland and you’re going over a lot
48:30
of full-sized forested areas, describe the process of going over and then
48:40
the arrival shall we say.
48:46
To travel in from Vancouver, you do fly 15 or
48:56
maybe 20 minutes over for the most part green forests.
49:01
A lot of it’s industrial forest.
49:05
You may catch a little Forest Service.
49:08
Been pretty heavily managed, but
49:12
then you pop into the blast zone and it is just absolutely stunning.
49:19
You have the gaping crater and
49:25
then just valley upon valley, Clearwater and Bean and Smith and the upper Toutle
49:35
and the Green River, these monstrous valleys that have all been overridden
49:39
by the blast with these amazing patterns of toppled forest and some
49:46
cases monstrous, 600-year-old forest.
49:52
For years since, if you drive in from the east side, it’s just totally mind-boggling
49:59
the immensity of the blast disturbance.
50:08
It’s really an amazing scene to behold.
50:14
Your question about the ecologists going in
50:19
early on, I think Jerry got, I think it was $50,000 from the National
50:26
Science Foundation for a type of grant that was at one time a Sugar grant.
50:34
Now it’s called
50:38
a Rapid grant, where you can get funding quickly to study something where you
50:45
really need to capitalize on it and it bypasses the formal peer review
50:54
system, which takes months and months.
50:59
We got some Forest Service research funding and some National
51:04
Science Foundation funding.
51:08
Jerry spearheaded that.
51:12
Then, Jim Sedell, who had led the stream team and was good buddies with
51:17
the lakes people up at the University of Washington from the IBP era of the
51:28
‘70s, so Jim led the charge on the aquatics front, which was lakes, ponds,
51:34
streams, and hydrothermal environments.
51:37
Jerry was leading the overall charge and then on the forest vegetation front, and
51:46
then I played a role of helping to bridge to the geology community, especially
51:51
people like Dick Janda and others at USGS.
51:57
We were trying to facilitate interactions to encourage interdisciplinarity.
52:03
That’s so critical in that context, as I like to say you can’t tell
52:09
your best geology story unless you’re reading all the messages
52:15
that you can that the ecological
52:21
conditions have to tell you.
52:25
You can’t tell your best ecology story unless you really
52:29
have the geology straight.
52:34
The geo-eco interactions, which had become the dominant theme for my career at that
52:41
point, geo-eco interactions really came together in spades and with a boom there.
52:50
Some of the first activities of the ecology scene
52:58
were to contract with a big Greyhound bus type helicopter, that could
53:06
carry like 16, 18, 20 people.
53:09
A big Sikorsky, workhorse kind of one?
53:11
Yeah, well, it wasn’t a Skycrane type, but it was one
53:16
of those big troop transporters.
53:19
Most of our pilots were Vietnam veterans
53:25
and then take people in and stop at various places and get out and say,
53:29
well, what the hell’s happening here?
53:31
What was probably here before and what’s happening now?
53:35
There were some of these early trips, and then we had the first Pulse
53:40
and Pulses are a very important theme for Mount St. Helens.
53:47
Jerry had run Pulses before to places like Mount Rainier, the Hoh River
53:55
in the Olympic Peninsula, west side, and Sequoia Kings National Park.
54:05
Many of these are national parks.
54:07
He wanted to do them with his crews of people, students and
54:16
technicians and volunteers and others.
54:20
He roped Jim Sedell and Jerry and I and our colleagues in and Jerry was
54:29
doing it partly for team building.
54:31
Also, he was having his work crews put in these hectare-scale big permanent sample
54:40
plots in native forests and I’ve accused him of wanting to get an aluminum numbered
54:49
tag in every tree in the northwest.
54:52
This was part of his effort to do that.
54:58
When Mount St. Helens erupted and there were the challenges of getting in there,
55:09
we organized Pulses in the summer of ’80 and ’81.
55:16
They ran 2 weeks.
55:17
They were based out of the Cispus Center, which was an environmental learning center
55:22
mostly for schoolkids in Washington.
55:26
There were bunkhouses
55:29
and a big mess hall, cafeteria style.
55:35
We could travel into the blast area from there.
55:39
We arranged for radios that had the right frequencies.
55:45
Forest Service had passes for getting in and we got some four-wheel drive
55:50
vehicles to help with transportation and also contracted helicopters.
55:56
Let’s go back, though, to that first day.
56:00
Give me some more details about that first day.
56:02
You talked about the personal angles and about the reaction of David Johnston’s
56:07
colleague and that kind of thing, but tell me about you’re looking around a little
56:12
bit for remnants of his camp, correct?
56:16
Then you decide to land somewhere to look at something.
56:19
What decisions do you recall that made into where you landed and why?
56:25
Well, Barry Voight was our leader, and he’s a specialist of big
56:32
landslides.
56:32
We were interested in looking at the landslide deposits.
56:40
It’s interesting that Bezymianny volcano had blown up in Kamchatka in
56:46
the ‘50s and there was a good report on it, but no American had ever
56:52
been there because [SS interrupts]
56:52
. Because of the Cold War.
56:53
It was the Cold War and that’s where ICBM’s [intercontinental
56:59
ballistic missile] bases were set up for launching at us.
57:08
But, it was said that he had a photo of Bezymianny which showed a gaping
57:15
crater and a big rubbly, hummocky landslide deposit [in his office] . It
57:21
seemed like it had erupted very much in the style of Mount St. Helens.
57:27
Anyway, he was interested in this matter of the timing of
57:30
the landslide versus the blast.
57:35
The place that I most vividly remember for several reasons was a saddle towards
57:46
the east end of Johnston’s Ridge, where some of the landslide had ridden
57:52
over the thousand-foot high ridge and spilled into the next drainage of the
57:59
headwaters of South Coldwater Creek and then run-down South Coldwater
58:05
Creek, scouring the hillsides and leaving deposits in the bottom [of
58:14
the valley] . I remembered we stopped in that saddle.
58:18
We dug a pit that was about a foot deep.
58:22
Two things I remember observing there that were geo-eco interactions things.
58:30
One is that we found a big chunk of a Doug fir tree in the deposits.
58:39
It had the sort of lacy, alectorid lichens on the bowl.
58:47
If you go into an upper elevation forest and you look on the tree boles and they’re
58:54
a little hairy with light green lichens
59:00
and I remember noting that they did not look scorched, heated.
59:07
They were probably in the
59:11
landslide deposit, which had arrived first, because there was
59:15
this granular [SS interrupts]
59:16
. Before the pyroclastic flow.
59:18
Before the big blast deposit.
59:20
Because then there was this finer, better-sorted blast material on top of it,
59:27
but only a few tens of centimeters thick.
59:33
I commented on that interpretation, which was a reading of the biology,
59:37
you know, to Barry and he said, “Oh, man, that’s way cool.” He said, hey
59:42
Harry, if you study this landslide you need to talk to the ecologists
59:46
and see what they have to tell you.
59:48
You remember that exact geology ecology like must be talking to each
59:53
other from the very, very first.
59:55
Yes.
59:56
First stop.
59:58
The second thing of that note, which I had a chance only a month or two ago to
1:00:05
discuss with one of the world’s experts in mycology, Jim Trappe, second thing was
1:00:18
after we’d been there a few minutes some of the granule sized particles in the
1:00:25
deposits on the walls of our little pits,
1:00:34
you know, little rock fragments maybe 5, 6, 7 mm across were dangling from
1:00:41
spiderweb-like filaments in the breeze, and, so, later in talking with some
1:00:50
mycologists, I came to think that they were probably mycelia of burn-site fungi;
1:01:01
and Jim Trappe, I stuck my head in his office the other day, and I was asking
1:01:10
him about that and he and colleagues had gone in there right at the get-go, and
1:01:15
they had found several tens of species of
1:01:22
fungi that had those properties that, if they’re heated, if the spores are heated
1:01:30
significantly, but not too much, then they will germinate and start sending mycelia
1:01:40
through the soil and they’ve adapted to wildfire, which is a frequent part
1:01:51
of our northwest forest landscape, whereas blast deposits and blast
1:01:59
processes are extremely rare and not frequent enough to be an evolutionary
1:02:05
force, whereas fire [SS interrupts]
1:02:06
. They’re rare in human historic time.
1:02:09
They are.
1:02:09
In that context, right?
1:02:10
Right.
1:02:10
But they’re probably not an evolutionary force and so here may be an adaption
1:02:18
to wildfire with these fungi that can help sop up nutrients that are
1:02:25
released by first burning fire and then the first rains would mobilize
1:02:34
nitrogen and other critical nutrients.
1:02:37
If you have these fungi all ready to go,
1:02:42
they may help retain those nutrients in the terrestrial ecosystem, rather than
1:02:46
having them flushed out of the system.
1:02:51
The effect of the steam-driven blast, when the superheated groundwater
1:02:57
flashed to steam to create the blast, had both heat and moisture.
1:03:04
After the blast occurred and the blast cloud expanded off to the north, the water
1:03:10
could condense, that steam could condense on the rock fragments in the atmosphere.
1:03:17
You had both the heat and the water come together in that context and I think
1:03:23
produce what I’d say [SS interrupts]
1:03:24
. A perfect medium for regeneration or continued growth, right?
1:03:28
Yeah.
1:03:28
They may not have, you know, survived because of inadequate organic matter.
1:03:36
I just don’t know.
1:03:40
Those are the kinds of things that occurred on that first afternoon of May
1:03:46
28th and I was just totally stoked by it.
1:03:52
So, you were there only one, part of one day, correct?
1:03:56
At that very early stage.
1:03:57
Like what, a few hours?
1:04:00
Oh, we might have had four or five hours that we were out there.
1:04:05
You went to how many locations?
1:04:06
You went to that one you were talking about, the little saddle on the
1:04:08
edge of Johnston Ridge, and then did you go down more into the Pumice
1:04:12
Plain area or anywhere like that?
1:04:15
I only remember two.
1:04:18
Maybe I could find my notebook.
1:04:19
I should go back and see if I can find it.
1:04:22
It was quite a scramble.
1:04:24
But more than anything, it must have been just a massively
1:04:27
overwhelming processing of
1:04:32
this experience, even for somebody like you or other people who are serious
1:04:36
scientists, but you’re humans, too.
1:04:39
Oh yeah,
1:04:43
you know there had been a few things.
1:04:48
First time going into the little blast zone at Chaitén Volcano down in Chile
1:04:54
or going out for a few days during the ’96 flood to the Andrews and watching
1:05:00
things over the course of a couple days.
1:05:04
Gordon Grant was doing some video work.
1:05:06
He got about 25 minutes of the video coverage and we’re
1:05:09
commenting on what we’re seeing.
1:05:12
These are cases where, as a specialist in this kind of stuff, you are
1:05:18
seeing so much and you’re making rapid-fire interpretations and it’s
1:05:25
just, there’s just so many things to observe and interpret and over
1:05:31
that whole summer of 1980 and ’81 I was still finding amazing things.
1:05:38
Other people were observing them, too, and making their interpretations.
1:05:43
But, it was just a constant barrage and delight of all the little
1:05:49
mysteries that were going on.
1:05:52
In the context of these Pulses, so for [SS interrupts]
1:05:54
. So, you’re moving forward to the more formal Pulses later in
1:05:58
the year and beyond, correct?
1:05:59
Yeah.
1:06:03
In the Pulses, for example, people go out and do their fieldwork.
1:06:09
We had, I think, it was like 160 people or so over the two-week period
1:06:20
with up to 100 at a time.
1:06:21
Some people were coming and going.
1:06:24
We had a film crew from NOVA for a while.
1:06:27
At one point we had 5 helicopters taking off.
1:06:30
It was like Apocalypse Now,
1:06:35
but in the evenings then we would have just a big, open forum in a gym
1:06:40
at the Cispus Learning Center and people would just share their stories.
1:06:47
Then the limnologists might be staying up all night processing
1:06:51
their samples in a makeshift lab.
1:06:53
It was just really a charged environment and there’d be some media people.
1:06:58
A big part of it is communicating to the world via the media the stories
1:07:06
as they were unfolding and so that’s where the decade of training of the
1:07:14
‘70s, and how to tell stories and how to see the connectivity amongst ecosystem
1:07:20
components and where disturbances fit in ecosystems – all this kind of training was
1:07:27
incredibly important in the first period, which has run for years, and actually
1:07:34
continues today in media communications and other kinds of communicating.
1:07:40
It’s very interesting, because that training in the early days
1:07:43
at Mount St. Helens proved to be extremely vital when the forest wars
1:07:50
emerged yet another decade later.
1:07:54
There’s this sort of play off between what we were experiencing in the context
1:08:02
of the Andrews and how basic science over the period of 10, 20, 30 years
1:08:11
played out big time in public and policy.
1:08:15
Same kinds of things for Mount St. Helens.
1:08:19
Now, I think Jim Sedell in his chapter in his chapter in In the Blast Zone,
1:08:24
called them the science tribes.
1:08:28
How do you remember the tribes, the different disciplines,
1:08:32
initially interacting?
1:08:35
Then, eventually maybe, or not maybe, maybe not seeing the fact that this was
1:08:40
a transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary effort at least on some level?
1:08:45
Well, for our tribe, however you define it [SS interrupts]
1:08:50
. I’m just saying, I’m stealing his language from the book.
1:08:52
Yeah, I know.
1:08:53
There’s a whole interesting little story about how we got that essay.
1:08:58
I’ll do “tribe” first, and then I’ll try to remember to go back to that essay.
1:09:07
He was very emotional in 2005
1:09:11
in the four-day experience of going to Mount St. Helens with a group of
1:09:16
writers and a few veteran scientists. It’s documented in our book In
1:09:22
the Blast Zone from OSU Press in
1:09:28
2008.
1:09:28
Anyway, he was very emotional because he’d left the science-doing world and had gone
1:09:35
deeply into the science-administration world, and when he was there, he
1:09:40
realized how much he missed that.
1:09:45
But, an interesting thing in the early Mount St. Helens period, and to some
1:09:51
extent it continues, in the forest wars period of the latest ‘80s well
1:10:02
into the 1990s in the period of the President’s Forest Summit, which Jim
1:10:11
performed with Clinton and Gore in Portland in ’93 and then on through the
1:10:18
formation of the Northwest Forest Plan.
1:10:23
You know these were really big phenomena, social phenomena and
1:10:31
science had a big play in it, and it was so big that for the most part
1:10:41
there didn’t have to be turf wars.
1:10:44
There was stuff for everybody to work on and it was still bigger than all the stuff
1:10:52
we were working on.
1:10:53
Also, because of our humble roots in the early ‘70s as a bunch of shaggy
1:10:58
postdocs working for some guys who seemed older, like Jerry Franklin and
1:11:02
Dick Waring, but really weren’t very much older, but they just happened to
1:11:07
be leading the show on these innovative, wild, and wooly things and this is
1:11:16
post, not too far from the ‘60s and sort of peace and love revolution type stuff.
1:11:28
Anyway, that was a little bit of the mood.
1:11:32
People were just working hard and having a good time and learning a lot and we,
1:11:40
like on the forest-stream-geomorphology interactions in the ‘70s or work on
1:11:45
the role of wood in streams was highly integrative and each party brought
1:11:51
something to the story and no one party, no one discipline, owned the story.
1:11:57
Same thing at St. Helens.
1:11:59
Nobody owned the story.
1:12:01
It was a big story.
1:12:05
I think that was really
1:12:10
powerfully important in the degree of comradery
1:12:15
and mutual support.
1:12:19
I want to go back and clarify and frame the progression of the scientific trips,
1:12:27
Pulses, whatever you call them, that happened after that initial foray, shall
1:12:33
we say, in a few days after the eruption.
1:12:38
Yeah, I’m speaking from my own experience here and I’m sure other things were
1:12:44
going on, especially to try to get it from Jerry, and if you get to talk to
1:12:50
somebody like Roger del Moral or Jim MacMahon you should ask them, because
1:12:57
their experiences are different.
1:12:58
They’re going to be at the Pulse?
1:13:00
Jerry will be there the first few days.
1:13:04
I think Roger del Moral will be there.
1:13:06
He’s retired and is I believe not continuing his field studies.
1:13:14
Virginia Dale may be there, and you should ask [SS interrupts]
1:13:18
. She’s one of your coeditors on your ecological response in the book, correct?
1:13:21
Right, she’s at Oak Ridge.
1:13:26
I think she was a grad student at UW at the time.
1:13:30
Each of these people will have different
1:13:34
experiences.
1:13:35
Some of the activities would have been in common.
1:13:40
I
1:13:44
had that first trip that I described on May 28.
1:13:49
I think I went up there with Dick Janda
1:13:56
at USGS on some other trips.
1:14:00
I remember that the Forest Service, the National Forest, made it difficult
1:14:08
in some ways to get in there and was discouraging of their own staff to go in.
1:14:15
I remember we on the Forest Service research front wanted to take in a soil
1:14:20
scientist for the National Forest and
1:14:25
the National Forest staff didn’t want him to go in.
1:14:29
My impression was they were familiar with fires, but that they
1:14:34
weren’t familiar with volcanoes.
1:14:39
That made them [SS interrupts]
1:14:42
. Nervous?
1:14:42
Nervous.
1:14:43
Anyway,
1:14:45
I remember going on a trip, and actually there’s a picture from it in this US
1:14:49
Geological Survey Professional Paper 1250 of a trip with Janda on the Toutle River
1:14:58
looking at mudflow impacts, for example.
1:15:00
Anyway, there was various field tripping that was occurring and then there was
1:15:07
the Pulse and I forget the dates of it.
1:15:11
Now we’re doing them generally at the beginning of August, although
1:15:15
this year it’s a little bit early.
1:15:18
When the vegetation is in a pretty good state for plant ID
1:15:27
and phenologically and before the Ecological Society of America meetings.
1:15:33
I’d be curious to learn, and I expect we have records of it.
1:15:38
Somewhere I may even have all the notes on who all the participants were.
1:15:44
I don’t know if you’ve found that in any of the files you’ve looked at.
1:15:50
There are so many files in there.
1:15:51
I did make notes of what the St. Helens stuff was, but we’re still
1:15:55
focused mainly on the Andrews.
1:15:57
They weren’t as detailed as the other ones.
1:16:00
Right.
1:16:00
The Pulse was so central in getting everybody together.
1:16:06
I think that that sense of community that occurred
1:16:11
that was fed by the Pulses was important in making it possible
1:16:17
to get this year 25 book done.
1:16:22
I was trying to lead to charge on it, and I was not successful in getting
1:16:28
closure, but Virginia Dale, who had done a bunch of books with Springer and had
1:16:35
an editor that she liked working with,
1:16:41
you know, got it done.
1:16:45
That was great.
1:16:48
There were also some symposia and workshops and we got some
1:16:53
workshop support funds from NSF.
1:16:57
I forget the dates of those.
1:16:59
I have them and I can dig some of them up.
1:17:02
But that helped communications within the ecology community.
1:17:09
There was really a smattering of activities over the course of the
1:17:16
summer that weren’t, summers of ’80 and ’81, they weren’t highly integrated.
1:17:25
Specifically, how did the Andrews team, if you could characterize as such,
1:17:31
become involved and how did they become involved that first year and beyond?
1:17:35
A bunch of people from the Andrews did go up there and I
1:17:38
think if you talk with Charlie,
1:17:44
some of the
1:17:48
Andrews people, like Mark Harmon and Kermit Cromack, who had been postdocs
1:17:54
in our group, and Jim and myself, people on the stream front, Norm
1:17:59
Anderson and then others, Chuck Hawkins who had been a postdoc in the River
1:18:10
Continuum Project in the late ‘70s.
1:18:13
He went and did work and has continued in conjunction with Charlie Crisafulli
1:18:20
in his capacity as a Utah State prof.
1:18:28
Many Andrews people went there.
1:18:30
We did not have an integrated Andrews group effort.
1:18:37
Many people who started work then let it slip and
1:18:45
have not persisted with it in some cases, creating problems and projects that
1:18:53
fall to Charlie to get [SS interrupts]
1:18:56
. Because he’s there, right?
1:18:57
Because he’s there and he is extremely attentive to keeping
1:19:02
long-term measurements programs going.
1:19:06
That’s not in everyone’s instinct, including my own.
1:19:10
I started some erosion studies and ran them for some years and
1:19:16
then let them go for several reasons, including at some sites
1:19:25
bioturbation by elk and snow creep were disrupting my measurement approach
1:19:33
with erosion pins and stuff like that.
1:19:39
Anyway,
1:19:43
what has become the science program is partly somewhat corporate and
1:19:52
Charlie’s personal energy and instincts, both socially within
1:19:59
the science social network and
1:20:04
logistically.
1:20:06
These have been exceptional in making possible the monstrous amount of work
1:20:13
that has been accomplished there.
1:20:15
Plus, there are other individuals.
1:20:19
Early on Larry Bliss and then Roger del Moral and some of their students
1:20:26
have kept quite a bit of work going
1:20:30
in close to the volcano, particularly on the Pumice Plain and some on the
1:20:34
south side, south flank and the upper flanks of the volcano, and just tons of
1:20:42
other work now under a LTREB [Long-Term Research in Environmental Biology],
1:20:49
an LTREB grant that keeps Charlie and
1:20:57
John Bishop from WSU, Vancouver, and Bill Fagan from Maryland
1:21:05
going on a bunch of studies.
1:21:09
It’s
1:21:12
nucleated by Charlie and then run by a bunch of individuals.
1:21:19
How would you describe the interactions in the first year between the USGS people
1:21:24
and all the ecosystem science people?
1:21:31
It’s very interesting to look at the USGS Professional Paper 1250
1:21:36
and they’ve been writing about it.
1:21:39
That’s their quick, out of the blocks, published in
1:21:48
1981, which is hyper fast for USGS, which is notoriously slow
1:21:56
in its publication process.
1:21:58
Glacial, to use an obvious metaphor, for them.
1:22:04
Yeah.
1:22:04
But it is amazing to me.
1:22:06
I’ve just been writing about it in this chapter for the
1:22:10
Mount St. Helens year 35 book,
1:22:15
how much observation of damage to vegetation the geologists of many
1:22:24
chapters used studying many processes in the 1250 volume – the amount of
1:22:33
charring, the amount of abrasion,
1:22:37
the damage
1:22:40
to the cuticle waxes on foliage
1:22:48
of trees in the scorch zone and all kinds of
1:22:56
biothermometry, for example, that
1:22:59
these geologists use.
1:23:01
In other words, they were studying geology, but they were referencing
1:23:04
the other in their descriptions?
1:23:07
The damage to the vegetation informed their interpretations
1:23:12
of the physical processes.
1:23:20
In some cases, they were collaborating with ecologists, but I think
1:23:23
in most cases they were not.
1:23:27
We did have, and we continue to have, some USGS guys show up at our
1:23:33
Pulses to help inform us of stories that are interesting and important.
1:23:43
So, the USGS doesn’t have Pulses, just more an ecosystem science thing?
1:23:50
Correct.
1:23:51
It was interesting that at Chaitén
1:23:57
we [Charlie, Julia, and I] had the good fortune of timing one of our visits, I
1:24:05
think it was our 2010 trip, at the same time that some of the USGS guys were
1:24:12
going, including volcanologists and also a couple of the hydro-geomorphology
1:24:17
guys with whom we have closer contact, partly because of the debris flow flume
1:24:22
at the Andrews, like with Jon Major.
1:24:29
That was a really interesting and exciting trip.
1:24:33
I mention it because, in a way, it was a Pulse.
1:24:37
It was an interdisciplinary trip and we shared views and then we have a collection
1:24:44
of papers in an issue of Andean Geology that includes our dominantly ecological
1:24:52
paper, although it’s in a geology journal, but it’s in this set of papers.
1:24:58
A really important part of it was that they had a helicopter under
1:25:02
contract that had to come a long way, because this is a pretty remote
1:25:08
place in terms of helicopter support.
1:25:11
You’re talking about down in South America?
1:25:13
Yeah.
1:25:17
A major reason for having a helicopter was after we’d been there for a while some
1:25:21
more people showed up from the Chilean counterpart to USGS, the SERNAGEOMIN.
1:25:33
These technicians showed up because they were going to install web cameras
1:25:39
and seismic equipment for monitoring Chaitén volcano in the future,
1:25:50
but there were some days there when the geologists had access to the helicopter
1:25:56
and they let us tag along and get dropped off in these places we never would have
1:26:02
gotten otherwise, so we could see some damage at levels that we weren’t getting
1:26:10
directly exposed to by foot or car.
1:26:16
That was the inadvertent Pulse.
1:26:19
Actually, it was written up as such in a short piece in EOS.
1:26:24
So, the Pulses started in 1980, maybe August or so, July, August?
1:26:29
The Pulse as a general phenomenon Jerry had been running in
1:26:33
earlier years in other places.
1:26:36
But we applied the technique of a giant group [SS talks over FS]
1:26:41
. And that happened—?
1:26:42
In ’80, ’81 and then not again until,
1:26:49
I don’t remember if we did it in 2000.
1:26:51
We did it in 2005 and ’10 and... [trials off]
1:26:53
. Now what were the different studies for instance of the
1:26:59
records that I’ve seen down in the Forestry Sciences Lab that have
1:27:02
’80, ’81, ’82, ’83, ’84, ’85 and
1:27:05
some of them even continue up to ’89.
1:27:08
What are those from do you know?
1:27:13
Well, there are many studies that were going on out there.
1:27:16
The ones that you probably found, I don’t know if these are those or not.
1:27:22
There were many vegetation plots that were put in, some in the context of
1:27:28
riparian zones along the mudflow, so there are mudflow related studies.
1:27:36
Peter Frenzen and Joe Means were involved in those.
1:27:39
There were the uplands studies in the blast zone that included
1:27:44
paired up plots of downed timber
1:27:51
and salvaged timber and pre-eruption clear-cuts.
1:27:58
In some cases, there were three plots that were adjacent
1:28:02
in those three circumstances.
1:28:05
Those have been difficult to keep going.
1:28:08
Then there’s [SS interrupts]
1:28:10
. Funding or access, or both?
1:28:12
Funding and a champion who is really attentive to keep them going.
1:28:16
Then there are just all kinds of other studies,
1:28:21
many of which are managed by Charlie.
1:28:23
They include birds and ponds and amphibians and fish in Spirit
1:28:28
Lake and a bunch of veg stuff.
1:28:32
Some of those are arrayed along a disturbance gradient from the Pumice
1:28:37
Plain right in front of the volcano through the blast zone, including
1:28:43
toppled tree and standing dead and the various levels out in the
1:28:51
tephra deposition out in the green forest.
1:28:57
What kind of permits did you have to get to do studies back in the early days?
1:29:00
Obviously, you needed to have access, the red zone thing.
1:29:04
Beyond that was it kind of the wild west?
1:29:08
There was pre-monument, pre-how do we manage this new landscape kind of thing.
1:29:14
They just mainly were concerned with your safety?
1:29:22
There was a permitting and reporting system for studies and
1:29:36
that was a time when the National Forest were trying, and they still do, try to
1:29:42
keep track of what’s going on where,
1:29:47
so they minimize damage to research efforts.
1:29:57
We were familiar with that from the Andrews where we have to be attentive
1:30:02
to where people are working because we want to maximize synergies and minimize
1:30:10
footprint in control areas and not have people interfere with other people’s work.
1:30:18
There
1:30:20
was
1:30:23
an effort on the part of the National Forest to track who was doing what where.
1:30:29
I don’t remember the particulars.
1:30:34
I vaguely remember some form.
1:30:39
Then
1:30:41
there was in the Monument Act—so, congress passed Mount St. Helens National
1:30:50
Volcanic Monument Act, was that ’83?
1:30:59
That established some kind of science advisory board
1:31:06
and that ran for some years.
1:31:08
I remember Jack Winjum was one of the leaders of it.
1:31:19
Here you’ve handed me the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic
1:31:22
Monument Draft Environmental Impact Statement Preemptive Management Plan,
1:31:29
October 7, 1984.
1:31:33
This plan was
1:31:40
produced in accordance with the directives in the
1:31:48
National Volcanic Monument Act of ’83.
1:31:53
I remember several of us and I was one and Joe Means was another and I
1:31:59
think Jim Sedell may have had a role.
1:32:03
We worked up in Vancouver.
1:32:05
I remember staying at the Shilo Inn and eating at the Spaghetti Factory
1:32:14
and
1:32:17
so scientists were involved in the development of this management plan.
1:32:28
One thing I remember from the early days, that is
1:32:36
probably ’80 or ’81, during the Pulse.
1:32:40
I remember a day when Jerry and maybe Jim and I stayed in, didn’t go to the field.
1:32:46
We were outlining a map
1:32:52
features of special interest for research.
1:32:56
We’d outline Spirit Lake but then we needed to outline the
1:32:59
contributing watershed to Spirit Lake.
1:33:04
I remember interacting with Dick Janda, who was very keen on having
1:33:08
the upper Green River included in the monument, because he was hoping
1:33:12
the USGS would put in a gauging station there so we could look at
1:33:18
what the sediment production and runoff was like in basins
1:33:23
with different disturbances.
1:33:25
He and others in USGS were involved with quite a bit of that, particularly
1:33:29
off on the Toutle River drainage side.
1:33:33
In that area, in part it related to what the Corps of Engineers
1:33:38
might do for control of sediment and runoff down into the Cowlitz,
1:33:49
lower Toutle,
1:33:52
Cowlitz Columbia system and the effects on communities down there, for example.
1:33:56
Incredible that it stopped shipping in the Columbia for a short period of time.
1:34:01
Well it was [SS interrupts]
1:34:02
. A month or so, didn’t it?
1:34:03
--quite an amazing phenomenon because the Interstate 5 and the railroad line, which
1:34:11
is a major north-south [transportation] corridor, was closed down as the monstrous
1:34:19
North Fork Toutle mudflow approached.
1:34:24
That was a very brief shut down, but then the shipping channel was closed
1:34:28
and there was great concern about Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, which
1:34:33
was just upriver from the confluence of the Cowlitz and the Columbia.
1:34:42
In terms of monster infrastructure and commerce, the reach of
1:34:48
the volcano was 60, 70 miles.
1:34:53
How would you compare this eruption to other historic eruptions?
1:35:00
I mean, macro-geographically, also in the Cascade Range.
1:35:07
Well, clearly in terms of Euro human presence, it’s far and
1:35:12
away the biggest deal in the Cascades in the past centuries.
1:35:22
Mount Mazama would be the last just gigantic blast,
1:35:26
or more recently than that?
1:35:30
That’s where I would go, you know 7,000 or so years ago.
1:35:35
Cascades have been relatively quiet compared to say some Indonesian
1:35:42
and southern Chilean volcanic systems, which are quite active.
1:35:49
In terms of intensity, you’d have to go back to Krakatoa or Tambora?
1:35:55
Oh, it wasn’t that, those were real big.
1:35:59
You can just look that up and look at the Volcanic Explosivity,
1:36:04
VEI, Volcanic Explosivity Index.
1:36:08
St. Helens ranks up there, but it didn’t [SS interrupts]
1:36:11
. Not in the top tier.
1:36:12
Right.
1:36:14
It was a little steam-driven blast and a pretty good-sized landslide.
1:36:20
But it pales in comparison with the landslide from 100,000 or
1:36:26
300,000 years ago from Shasta that you drive through on I-5.
1:36:32
I think it’s at least an order of magnitude, maybe several orders of
1:36:38
magnitude bigger volume of that landslide.
1:36:41
Off to the west side there, right?
1:36:43
To the north.
1:36:44
The north side, okay.
1:36:52
How big a deal is Mount St. Helens in ecological research terms?
1:36:59
Charlie and I, especially Charlie, have been working on that and we have one
1:37:05
very brief documentation at the end of our Encyclopedia of Volcanoes chapter
1:37:14
based on only 400-some publications from 44 volcanoes that have erupted since,
1:37:29
including Krakatoa, in 1883, which really launched this work in a way.
1:37:39
We had 44 volcanoes since 1883, which have had published studies of
1:37:49
plant and animal response to the eruption, and Mount St. Helens
1:37:56
counts for more than [SS interrupts]
1:38:02
. 70%, would by my guess, of the literature?
1:38:09
Let’s see, I don’t have the number here, but it’s a lot, and [SS interrupts]
1:38:14
. It’s kind of timing, really, I mean it’s the fact that it happened in
1:38:17
1980 right as ecosystem science was becoming developed and the fact
1:38:21
that it happened in the middle of a developed country, where everybody,
1:38:25
there was a huge cadre of trained scientists ready to go in, correct?
1:38:30
Correct.
1:38:30
So, we’re going to write more detailed description of this.
1:38:36
Here we’re looking at this figure that has a timeline of these 44 volcanoes
1:38:42
beginning in 1883 up through Caulle in 2011, which have published plant and
1:38:52
animal studies from them, and, so, Mount St. Helens in this documentation has 177,
1:39:04
and, so, there are many aspects of St. Helens that make it so heavily studied,
1:39:12
and it’s one of only 3 highly-studied,
1:39:18
of the highest class of study intensity, which include Krakatoa,
1:39:24
Surtsey, which erupted from the sea south of Iceland in the early 1960s,
1:39:35
then St. Helens.
1:39:36
These are
1:39:39
the three biggies.
1:39:43
St. Helens for reasons such as you just described: a high level of access; many
1:39:49
processes, volcanic processes involved affecting a wide array of ecosystem
1:39:57
types: forest, alpine meadows, lakes, ponds, streams, rivers; lots of access,
1:40:09
lots of scientists in the neighborhood tuned in on these kinds of phenomena
1:40:18
and sustained public interests and a good interpretive program which feeds
1:40:26
science stories to the globe through programs such as NOVA and so forth.
1:40:35
Mount St. Helens has a very special place
1:40:40
in society and in culture.
1:40:43
We’re getting a little ahead of ourselves with a legacy and influence and things
1:40:46
like that, because I really do want to go into the real details of the ecosystem
1:40:51
science and different sub-disciplinary and different subject areas, but the legacy
1:40:57
factor is enormous in ecosystem science.
1:41:02
Obviously, it’s part of the geological study that’s been going on for a long
1:41:05
time, and that still remains the primary for a lot of scientists regarding
1:41:10
volcanism, but in terms of ecosystem science, its legacy is hard to match.
1:41:18
Or it’s unmatched.
1:41:20
Well, we have a picture of the place of Mount St. Helens in
1:41:28
disturbance ecology from volcanoes.
1:41:31
That’s pretty easy to see and document, and that’s what Charlie’s been working on.
1:41:40
The stuff that we have in the Encyclopedia chapter is based on
1:41:45
only 400 some publications and now he’s expanded that to over 800.
1:41:52
We got to go back to the analysis.
1:41:55
I
1:41:57
don’t think that the broad outline of a story will change, but it’ll
1:42:05
be a richer and more nuanced story.
1:42:10
But the impact of Mount St. Helens on ecological thinking in general
1:42:17
is harder to weigh, for me.
1:42:21
I just can’t speak to that with authority.
1:42:23
I’m too deep in these particular weeds to see that and I’m not really any
1:42:29
kind of historian of ecology itself.
1:42:33
I’ll leave that to others to sort out.
1:42:36
Well, it would seem to me that just the mere fact that so much energy
1:42:43
went into studying ecosystem science at this place sends a powerful
1:42:47
message that that’s an important part of studying any volcanic process.
1:42:53
Obviously, some countries and situations are more or less situated
1:42:58
to be able to do that, especially with the intensity that this happened.
1:43:01
It seems to me that
1:43:05
the study results and the continuing study would offer many valuable comparisons,
1:43:15
contrasts, analogies to certainly temperate zone coniferous forests.
1:43:21
Japan would come to mind as a more obvious analog, in terms of latitudinally,
1:43:26
but also even to more tropical zones you just have to make exceptions for
1:43:30
certain conditions that are different.
1:43:33
But, still, you could still make those analogies and comparisons.
1:43:36
It would seem like even though that stands alone, just like in any scientific history
1:43:44
of any scientific discipline or study area, we often go from a certain place
1:43:50
and then we go out and we either reject or we challenge or we change the language,
1:43:54
just like the geologic language was all based in European nomenclature, and
1:44:00
that’s gradually changing a little bit.
1:44:03
The outcome from basically eastern Europe and central Europe and the
1:44:06
history of geology really well.
1:44:08
The same thing would be true for ecosystem science in this context, as this spreads
1:44:13
out and it applies or it doesn’t apply and then it gets changed, morphs and
1:44:18
turns into something different, maybe.
1:44:22
Yeah, I think
1:44:27
like you say in a way it’s a bit of a perfect storm in the sense that
1:44:37
big, diverse eruption occurred in
1:44:44
an area with
1:44:48
federal lands where there’s a strong commitment to research and learning
1:44:55
and in a cultural context where that’s possible and there was a big investment.
1:44:59
There’s been a big investment in interpretative facilities and
1:45:02
programs, which really actually had an overreach because not all those
1:45:07
facilities have been self-sustaining, but they’re still beautiful and some
1:45:12
of them are really offering a lot of information delivery to the public.
1:45:17
Then the value of the science as content for interpretive programs is
1:45:26
well-recognized because the leadership of those programs and interpretive
1:45:31
programs recognize and capitalize on it.
1:45:39
A lot of great stuff is happening.
1:45:41
It’s sort of an archetype.
1:45:42
On the other hand, I kind of look at LTER programs and I’m thinking,
1:45:53
well, there’s certainly a lot more that can be done at Mount St. Helens.
1:45:59
It deserves to be an LTER-like site that has the level of Forest
1:46:04
Service and [SS interrupts]
1:46:05
. Has that ever been proposed?
1:46:09
I don’t think it was ever formally proposed when there
1:46:12
had been opportunities.
1:46:15
But
1:46:18
the magnitude of what’s happened on the science-doing front is a big role
1:46:26
of Charlie and his personal energy.
1:46:30
There’s
1:46:34
the power of the place in continuing to attract the interest of scientists.
1:46:40
Because it is what it is.
1:46:41
It is what it is as a phenomenal landscape.
1:46:48
But, on neither the NSF nor the Forest Service Research fronts has there been a
1:46:55
commitment to infrastructure at the scale of an LTER site for data management, for
1:47:08
corporate data collection, you know stream gauging in one thing or another,
1:47:13
and a lot of this stuff is getting done, but it’s a bit catch-as-catch-can and
1:47:21
it’s understaffed relative to the impact of the program and it takes stomach
1:47:32
lining from people like Charlie, who constantly sweat the bureaucracy and fight
1:47:39
the budget wars to keep things afloat.
1:47:44
It seems to me like once Charlie retires there’s going to be a void.
1:47:50
There’s a succession
1:47:53
thinking and planning underway now.
1:47:55
Okay, good.
1:47:58
He’s in better shape now than he has been in the past because we have
1:48:03
a station director [PNW Research Station] that recognizes the importance
1:48:06
of the impacts of the program.
1:48:12
We are going to take a brief break right now and we’ll come back.
1:48:16
This is file 31.
1:48:17
When we come back it’ll probably be file 32.
1:48:19
>>Transition from
1:48:34
Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the interview.
1:48:37
Okay we are back on the record, basically phase 2 of this interview today on July 2,
1:48:46
2015, between Samuel Schmieding and Fred Swanson in his Corvallis home.
1:48:51
We will basically recommence where we left off and we will continue talking
1:48:57
about his experience with Mount St. Helens, ecosystem science, and his career.
1:49:06
Now, where would you say that Mount St. Helens fits in the overall
1:49:10
constellation of your science career projects, in the kind of, shall
1:49:15
we say, vector of your career?
1:49:21
Mount St. Helens has a very important place in my career, but I have had lots of
1:49:28
activities that have occurred elsewhere.
1:49:30
I can think of a number of features of my career, some of which had
1:49:39
origin points well in advance of the eruption, but had important play
1:49:47
in the Mount St. Helens context.
1:49:49
First, is the interest and instinct for interdisciplinarity which really
1:49:56
began in my experiences at the Bermuda Biological Station after my
1:50:01
freshman year at Penn State in 1963.
1:50:04
Of course, Mount St. Helens has been a wonderful venue for practicing
1:50:12
interdisciplinarity among science disciplines and with the science and
1:50:14
humanities and in other contexts.
1:50:18
Second, volcanology and volcano ecology, of course, Mount St. Helens
1:50:25
has been hugely central to that, but I’d been launched by my work at the
1:50:34
Andrews Forest and studies of young Cascade volcanoes as I tried to do
1:50:42
the work on the old volcanic rocks in the Cascades, as found in the Andrews,
1:50:48
plus the Galapagos work in about 1970.
1:50:56
The concepts of forest and stream ecosystems and the teamwork involved
1:51:01
there had tremendous play at Mount St. Helens, but it really was really
1:51:09
formed in the IBP era in the ‘70s at the Andrews, which for me began in ’72.
1:51:17
But Mount St. Helens was particularly important in challenging and
1:51:23
broadening disturbance concepts and for me a disturbance person
1:51:28
that was really important.
1:51:32
Fourth, amazingly, Mount St. Helens eruption and the Andrews
1:51:38
LTER both began in 1980.
1:51:40
I’ve sort of been bouncing back and forth between those two worlds and seeing what
1:51:47
can be done with LTER like science and then hoping that that could happen at
1:51:53
Mount St. Helens, including infrastructure issues, such as information management.
1:52:01
The forest wars and the Northwest Forest Plan formulation and implementation was a
1:52:07
big distraction for me and probably others in the Andrews group, a distraction from
1:52:13
Mount St. Helens work, particularly in the late ‘80s and the first half of the ‘90s.
1:52:19
Is
1:52:21
that responsible, perhaps, for a waning of the intensity from your
1:52:26
group in terms of studying St. Helens because they were distracted by, shall
1:52:30
we say, pressing political issues?
1:52:33
There could be some of that for sure, I think, although some of the waning
1:52:39
may have occurred even earlier.
1:52:41
But I do see important complementarity
1:52:46
between the Andrews and the Mount St. Helens experiences particularly
1:52:52
with respect to learning about communicating with the public
1:52:57
through the media and other ways.
1:53:00
Then, for me, there was some waning there in that period of the forest
1:53:05
wars, which for me were based more out of my Andrews experience.
1:53:13
But, a return to Mount St. Helens for synthesis work
1:53:19
on the Mount St. Helens year 25 book and the work on the Chilean
1:53:24
volcanoes in 2009 through 2013
1:53:29
and more recent volcano ecology synthesis with Charlie Crisafulli and actually
1:53:36
a bunch of my arts and humanities efforts have a substantial root in
1:53:41
the trip to Mount St. Helens with Gary Snyder, a poet, in 2000 and we didn’t
1:53:49
really get our activities going at the Andrews on humanities concertedly
1:53:56
until
1:54:09
2002, so Mount St. Helens helped seed those efforts.
1:54:12
That’s a little bit about the larger dimensions of my career
1:54:13
and how Mount St. Helens fits.
1:54:14
It seems like a rather fortuitous or coincidental, or however you
1:54:18
want to characterize it, that the LTER date, the initiation of that
1:54:25
program, and Mount St. Helens.
1:54:27
That’s interesting historical happenstance.
1:54:32
Well, both of them
1:54:35
are very interesting and unlikely.
1:54:38
The establishment of the LTER system by the National Science Foundation
1:54:43
was a radical change for the NSF.
1:54:48
It
1:54:51
was a human constructed change, whereas Mount St. Helens was an
1:54:55
out-of-the-blue geophysical thing.
1:54:58
I consider them both quite unlikely and their juxtaposition in that year
1:55:03
is all the more unlikely, therefore.
1:55:06
If you were going to describe the interplay between those two,
1:55:12
the Andrews and its satellite of research sites and St. Helens, how
1:55:17
would you describe that interplay?
1:55:23
Well, there were some
1:55:28
really tangible
1:55:33
aspects of the interplay with some of the same people in the tribe, as Jim
1:55:39
referred to them, and the same spirit and there was a familiarity, an emerging
1:55:46
familiarity, of communicating our messages in simply, broadly understood terms.
1:55:55
There were these behaviors and science questions and things like that that
1:56:01
were in common between the two places.
1:56:06
I do have the feeling that,
1:56:10
through Jerry Franklin’s model and mentoring, we all got used to stepping
1:56:18
up and doing things that were sort of public things on big stages.
1:56:25
Those two places ended up being big stages for performance.
1:56:28
How would you describe his mentoring?
1:56:34
Well, there is a little story.
1:56:41
I was, it’s probably on a tape from the Andrews oral history, but that I went with
1:56:49
a class that he was taking around touring the Northwest and he came to the Andrews.
1:56:56
I was with him in this class of University of Washington students, I
1:57:01
think some undergrads and some grads.
1:57:02
We went up to the Carpenter Mountain lookout.
1:57:06
He told a story while we were up there looking out across the landscape of the
1:57:09
first time that he set out to hike up there and this was in the ‘50s before
1:57:16
there were any of the roads that we could see from that vantage point.
1:57:21
He described how he was very aware of the point of which he had passed the point
1:57:27
of no return, that is, if he wanted to go back and sleep in a bed in the cabin
1:57:34
where he was staying, he needed to turn around then, because if he went further
1:57:39
it would be too dark to make it back.
1:57:41
He didn’t have a sleeping bag.
1:57:42
He was just out there, right?
1:57:43
Well, I think he was prepared physically to sleep out, but he wasn’t confident
1:57:50
that he was prepared mentally.
1:57:52
But he pushed himself and he slept out and he did fine and he slept out
1:57:58
a lot since then.
1:57:59
But my reaction, was, hey, you son of a bitch, you take us out there on a limb
1:58:05
past the point of no return and making arguments about the policy implications
1:58:11
of science or one thing or another like that and we had to go with you.
1:58:17
Was that a conscious thing he did to pull you along or was that just
1:58:22
the force of who he was and if you were with him, that’s where you went?
1:58:29
I think he felt that that’s where things needed to go, and, so, that’s where he
1:58:35
was going, and he wanted us with him.
1:58:38
We have not always followed him,
1:58:43
though we have greatly benefited by doing so.
1:58:50
He mentored by example,
1:58:54
especially in storytelling and enthusiasm for what you’re
1:59:00
doing and the importance of
1:59:06
helping the next generation along so that they can go do
1:59:09
the good work in the future.
1:59:11
Things of this nature.
1:59:13
He’s very inspirational to people, isn’t he?
1:59:15
Oh yeah.
1:59:21
You know he’s got a knack for picking big things to do, sort
1:59:26
of monumental experiments like the 200-year log decomposition
1:59:31
experiment in [SS talks over FS]
1:59:32
. That was actually his idea before Mark’s or Mark was—?
1:59:35
Correct, Jerry, my understanding, and you can check this with
1:59:39
both Jerry and Mark, that it was
1:59:44
Jerry’s idea to put down the stake [in the ground] and say this is what “long-term”
1:59:51
is all about. We’ll shoot for 200 years,
1:59:55
the decay lifetime of the logs of this size in some of these species.
2:00:02
That was to make an emphatic commitment to thinking and working on this timescale.
2:00:11
Mark was a graduate student, a very good and determined one.
2:00:19
His task was to implement it.
2:00:22
So, he did it.
2:00:22
And he continues to.
2:00:24
Yeah, and here we are in year 30.
2:00:26
Yes.
2:00:28
Along that, and this was something I was going to talk to you about
2:00:31
later, but we’ll go into it now,
2:00:35
what could be some specific programs, products, intellectual tracks, theorems,
2:00:40
axioms, that directly came out of the Andrews or St. Helens and one impacted
2:00:47
and interplayed back on the other?
2:00:49
Some specific examples?
2:00:52
The log decomp [decomposition] would be an obvious one to me in
2:00:55
a different environment, but still log decomp and a lot of downed wood.
2:01:01
For decomposers there’s
2:01:05
a feast of downed wood in a landscape like the blast zone at Mount St. Helens.
2:01:12
For me, as a disturbance ecology person with an emphasis on physical
2:01:19
processes, the disturbance thinking was hugely amplified by the experience
2:01:28
of Mount St. Helens and to try to think about what is the common
2:01:33
ground and what are the differences between volcanic and non-volcanic
2:01:38
disturbances and are volcanic processes
2:01:45
very unusual and not worthy of a lot of attention or do they have
2:01:53
really important things to teach us?
2:01:58
So, my experience in the Andrews of looking at fire, wind throw,
2:02:08
slow landslides, rapid landslides, flood-induced channel change,
2:02:17
root throw, all of these different processes provide a nice counterpoint in a
2:02:23
suite of non-volcanic processes to compare with the volcanic processes of pyroclastic
2:02:32
flows, lahars, monster debris avalanche, blast, tephra fall at Mount St. Helens.
2:02:43
I feel like we’ve learned a lot of interesting things about the importance
2:02:46
of biological legacies, the timing of disturbance events at multiple scales
2:02:54
and how that aligns or does not align with the state of the vegetation,
2:02:58
for example, or animals’ behavior
2:03:04
and thinking about disturbance mechanisms and not just types.
2:03:07
All of these ideas are a product of the experiences at both of those places.
2:03:17
Who else other than yourself is still at the Andrews that
2:03:20
was involved way back then?
2:03:25
Is that question who is now involved, both at the Andrews and Mount St. Helens?
2:03:32
Or either or.
2:03:32
I mean just who is still around that did some of that work back then?
2:03:36
I know Al Levno was there on some, he took pictures on some of the early trips.
2:03:41
Some of the other people, I’m forgetting their names right now, but what’s some of
2:03:44
the other people, the H.J. people, that took large roles, especially in the ‘80s.
2:03:51
Well, Jerry was pretty instrumental in helping get some of the science going
2:03:57
in the ‘80s, especially the overall.
2:04:00
Then he’s tried to pass that on to various disciples, including Peter Frenzen
2:04:08
and now Mark Swanson,
2:04:12
but his main engagement with St. Helens of late I would say is to be inspired
2:04:21
about the importance of early serial plant communities, plant and animal communities.
2:04:28
He’s sort of off working in the forest policy realm and drawing lessons
2:04:34
from the great Zen master, Mount St. Helens, or Zen mistress I should say.
2:04:40
Yes, it must be feminine in the gender reference as for mountains.
2:04:45
Ships and mountains.
2:04:49
Like Al Levno and George Lienkaemper, both well-retired, worked with
2:04:55
me early on the erosion studies, but are no longer involved.
2:05:04
There are people like Art McKee was involved with some of the
2:05:07
earliest riparian work, but has long been separated from that.
2:05:15
Charlie Crisafulli got there through his working for Jim
2:05:19
MacMahon out at Utah State.
2:05:27
Then there are a bunch of University of Washington people who have
2:05:34
early and lasting roles, such as Roger del Moral and his academic offspring.
2:05:46
Now, we’ve already talked about
2:05:50
various aspects of that first year, the first visit, something about the
2:05:56
structure of the science, the Pulses, the different things that happened.
2:06:00
May I ask you a more philosophical question: what were some of your central
2:06:04
assumptions, axiomatic/paradigmatic, about ecological processes and recovery
2:06:11
from major disturbance events, volcanic eruptions in particular, before
2:06:16
you studied at St. Helens and the surrounding region and how were those
2:06:19
changed, impacted, reinforced, etc.?
2:06:27
Well, I
2:06:30
felt like I wasn’t really trained,
2:06:37
or very well-read in ecological theory and
2:06:45
in fact that reminds me of,
2:06:49
with Stan Gregory, visiting Jim Sedell in his home in his last couple of months
2:06:58
[before his death to pancreatic cancer] and we were trying to see if he agreed
2:07:04
with some of the stories we had about him.
2:07:12
I said at one point, “What is the significance of your having gotten
2:07:18
your bachelor’s degree in philosophy?” which he did at Willamette University.
2:07:24
And he said, “I wasn’t trained,”
2:07:31
and I said, “Oh, no, you mean you weren’t constrained
2:07:39
by having been trained.” That was the real fun thing about
2:07:44
Jim is he wasn’t constrained.
2:07:46
His thought processes were very open.
2:07:49
Eclectic, yeah.
2:07:50
So, especially
2:07:54
that lack of training on my part and also being sort of a geological rootedness.
2:08:09
I was much more of an observational than hypothesis testing with
2:08:15
experimentation kind of guy.
2:08:18
Just because you really were trained as a geologist and your field training
2:08:24
was in this interdisciplinary thing that was happening at the Andrews.
2:08:28
Right.
2:08:28
You kind of took what you had there and went into this new place.
2:08:33
So, I wasn’t trained in botany or forest ecology, I wasn’t
2:08:41
formally trained in soil science.
2:08:44
I was just there in this interdisciplinary group in this very
2:08:50
dynamic landscape, be it Mount St. Helens or be it the Andrews Forest or
2:08:57
the other places I would go and work.
2:08:59
I did work a bunch of other places, too.
2:09:02
Anyway, I’m just there trying to figure how’s it ticking?
2:09:07
How’s this system working on different timescales?
2:09:12
I was much more of an observational, sort of natural history type.
2:09:18
Almost in the old mold.
2:09:20
Oh, definitely.
2:09:21
I mean, like [FS continues]
2:09:22
. I look back at my publication record.
2:09:24
It’s sort of textbook-ey in the sense that it doesn’t really deal
2:09:29
with data and experimentation.
2:09:32
It’s quite descriptive.
2:09:39
Now, we already talked about the general outlines of St. Helens that first year,
2:09:44
the first couple of years, but could you go into some of the details of some of the
2:09:49
experiments and things that you did, and even some of your memories and memorable
2:09:53
experiences, fun, dangerous, scary, whatever, that happened that first year?
2:09:58
What experiments did you set up?
2:10:01
Did the mountain start speaking to you in a way that made you nervous?
2:10:05
Just any of the things you did that first year,
2:10:10
or first couple of years.
2:10:11
Whatever you would like to cover.
2:10:19
I’ll mention three things.
2:10:21
One is just the opportunity to go explore.
2:10:26
It’s a vast area in which many different things happen, so I sort of assume my role
2:10:34
would be to connect geological stories to the ecology community and help the
2:10:42
ecologist try to get the geological story as straight as they could as necessary
2:10:50
for the work that they were doing on components of the overall landscape.
2:11:00
I used that as an excuse to get out to as many places as possible
2:11:05
by foot, by vehicle, by helicopter whenever I got the chance.
2:11:10
The second thing is my actual research stuff had to do with erosion processes,
2:11:20
as had been a major feature of my Andrews Forest work, and that included
2:11:28
processes that I worked on at the Andrews quite a bit, which involved small,
2:11:32
rapid landslides in different parts of the blast zone for the most part.
2:11:37
I did some landslide inventories along with Peter Morrison, who was a friend
2:11:43
and colleague, and we tried to look at how much land sliding had occurred
2:11:50
in the pre-eruption landscape on the east side of the blast zone based
2:11:54
on air photo analysis and then the landsliding that proceeded in the same
2:12:00
area during and after the eruption.
2:12:07
That was one fun project.
2:12:12
A second component of the erosion story had to do with processes that we don’t
2:12:18
see operating significantly in the green forest of places like the Andrews and
2:12:24
the Cascades and that is surface erosion and gully incision, but at Mount St.
2:12:30
Helens the landscape was so modified by the blast that within the blast
2:12:34
zone there was a good deal of water runoff in the first storms and there
2:12:44
was cutting of rills and small gullies.
2:12:48
So, I had some Forest Service money, some of which I routed to Tom Dunne
2:12:57
and then a student who worked with him, Brian Collins, University of
2:13:01
Washington, and we did studies, me in the east side of the blast zone and they
2:13:06
in the north side of the blast zone.
2:13:08
There were some differences in the texture of the deposits in the two
2:13:13
areas and we had a common study design where we put rebar in, drove it into
2:13:20
the ground, so we had erosion pins and we measured the cross-sections of the
2:13:25
little erosion channels between successive pieces of rebar and then we measured the
2:13:31
height of the rebar above ground level
2:13:35
and then we’d do this repeatedly, and then we could estimate the amount
2:13:40
of deposition or erosion by seeing whether the [above-ground parts of]
2:13:44
stakes were getting longer or shorter as material was eroded or deposited.
2:13:49
We had these lines of erosion pins crossing the slope at different positions
2:13:55
downslope from the drainage divide.
2:13:58
We’d do that in areas where there had been a pre-eruption clear-cut or in
2:14:03
areas of downed timber, so we were wandering around on these dusty, steep,
2:14:09
hot slopes through downed timber.
2:14:16
Crawling over big, big logs, right?
2:14:18
Yeah.
2:14:20
It was challenging.
2:14:22
It wasn’t your fun hike in the woods.
2:14:25
Right.
2:14:26
But we got to fly in on helicopters to some pretty wild and crazy areas.
2:14:31
One further comment on adventures is one day, and it might have been
2:14:37
as late as ’85, a couple of us got dropped off by a helicopter in the
2:14:43
mouth of the crater and we got to spend the day circumambulating the dome.
2:14:49
The whole dome, huh?
2:14:51
Yeah.
2:14:51
There had recently been like the week before a dome-growth eruption.
2:14:57
A big blob of new lava would be squeezed out, sort of like out of a tube of
2:15:05
toothpaste and grow a new lobe on the flanks of the dome, and then some
2:15:13
big boulders would roll off the dome.
2:15:16
It was really interesting.
2:15:18
At that time there was a crater floor there.
2:15:21
It was very interesting.
2:15:23
You had rockfall coming in off the crater wall on the one side and you
2:15:29
had the big, hot rocks rolling off the dome on the dome side, and I remember
2:15:36
walking towards one of these dome rocks.
2:15:39
It was about 20 feet tall and when I was still tens of feet away from it,
2:15:46
I could feel the radiant heat from its extrusion the week or so before.
2:15:55
Also, the dome growth then was heaving up the floor of the
2:15:59
crater, forming cracks from which
2:16:05
fumaroles were emitted and there were some amazing and bizarre streams,
2:16:11
hot streams with filamentous algae of different colors, depending
2:16:18
on [streamwater] temperature.
2:16:20
You had little snowfields that were melting nearby.
2:16:23
You had a lot of steep thermal gradients and thermal complexity in the water, hence
2:16:31
biotic complexity and visual complexity.
2:16:35
That was a day.
2:16:36
That is a day.
2:16:39
What was the mineral composition in general of the soils around St.
2:16:43
Helens before and how did that change from the major eruption, or certainly
2:16:50
the series of eruptions in ’81, the type of magma that came out—what was
2:16:55
the chemical composition in general?
2:16:57
How did that enrich or impoverish the soils?
2:17:02
Or, as base material for what would become soils?
2:17:05
As Jerry would like to say, “The soil falls from the sky.” Mount St.
2:17:13
Helens had this very vigorous eruptive history, and, so, northeast of the
2:17:20
volcano, east and northeast, there were many tephra units [deposits]
2:17:25
from earlier eruptions, including a couple, the Y and the W units, of
2:17:34
Crandell and Mullineaux - feet-thick, 10 miles from the volcano, of popcorn
2:17:43
size pumice, and it had very popcorn character to it: light and fluffy.
2:17:52
That fell into the forest.
2:17:54
There were places where you could see the forest had survived because
2:17:58
the trees had layered root systems in the different buried soils.
2:18:04
Some of that was pretty high in silica content and there wasn’t very fertile
2:18:13
material, but it looked like trees had persisted in a bunch of cases.
2:18:22
Then
2:18:25
in some of those areas you had the blast deposits.
2:18:29
The blast was different from an eruption of popcorn pumice.
2:18:36
It was shattered mountaintop.
2:18:38
It was a mixture of rocks from earlier eruptions.
2:18:44
How fine was it generally?
2:18:46
Well, it all depended on how far you were from the vent, but towards the
2:18:51
edge of the blast zone on the northeast trajectory, then the blast deposits that
2:18:51
were maybe 10, 20 cm thick, you know the
2:19:12
grain size was probably half a centimeter.
2:19:16
A
2:19:19
very fine gravel or coarse sand was pretty common, although there’d be a
2:19:24
layer of silt on top and then there were subsequent eruptions, let’s
2:19:32
say during June and July of 1980.
2:19:35
The June 25th one was the one that dumped a lot of ash on Portland, I remember.
2:19:39
Right and so there was a little crater in the big crater and small domes
2:19:46
would grow and then get sort of plug their own vent and then get blasted.
2:19:52
I remember one of the most interesting events for me was I went back to a
2:20:00
meeting in Virginia on forest succession.
2:20:05
I was going to D.C. for some reason and I got to give a talk at NSF, just a general
2:20:12
talk, and a colleague, Chuck Rosenfeld who worked for the National Guard,
2:20:20
was a pilot and a geography professor.
2:20:24
He was flying during the eruption on May 18th and had some amazing photographs and
2:20:33
this I think it was June, might have been July 13th.
2:20:37
You’re talking about the June eruption, though.
2:20:39
One of the June or July 13th eruption, one of those,
2:20:45
you know, I’d gone in on that May 28th trip that I described and
2:20:52
had some on the ground photos.
2:20:54
I had some good illustrations.
2:20:55
I remember the room was just totally packed.
2:21:00
It was a very big room.
2:21:03
So much fun to talk about this event out West, well, it was erupting that day.
2:21:11
You there was a lot of attention to that story.
2:21:16
It’s just been so much fun to be able to tell stories about that
2:21:26
volcano in these different settings.
2:21:28
Another very interesting opportunity to about some of the Mount St.
2:21:34
Helens story was at a meeting
2:21:40
at Snowbird in Utah when the debate about whether the dinosaurs were extinguished
2:21:48
at the end of the Cretaceous by giant volcanic eruptions, perhaps the Deccan
2:21:54
Traps in India, or whether it was from the bolide impact in what’s now the Yucatan.
2:22:02
The meteor, right?
2:22:02
Yeah.
2:22:05
I was invited to talk about lessons from Mount St. Helens.
2:22:10
Well, that was the wildest God damn meeting I had ever witnessed, where the
2:22:15
people would get up and give a talk and then they had an open mic for questions
2:22:20
and challenges and the lineups at the mic were long and the challenges were
2:22:26
very vigorous and the whole meeting schedule got totally out of whack.
2:22:34
I was supposed to talk late in the afternoon, and I remember Stephen J.
2:22:41
Gould was there and he was talking too.
2:22:43
Well, anyway, they said
2:22:47
okay we’ve blown the schedule, but the bar is set up.
2:22:52
We’re going to take a little break and you can go out and get a beer, and then we’re
2:22:55
going to come back and we’re going to have a couple more talks before we have dinner.
2:23:00
People went out and I saw people coming back with two
2:23:05
beers and then I got to talk.
2:23:14
It was fun and people really enjoyed it, because they had a beer in each hand,
2:23:22
I think.
2:23:22
I got some very positive feedback, but
2:23:27
my general point is, if you have the great fortune to work in a place like
2:23:35
the Andrews Forest or Mount St. Helens, these are amazing stages and the
2:23:44
analogy with theater is so interesting.
2:23:49
For people like Jerry who are big time performs or Stan or
2:23:54
Jim, you know, I like doing it, although I’m really an introvert.
2:24:01
They are great places to perform.
2:24:03
People expect a show and the stage setting is totally overwhelming.
2:24:10
They like a good story and a good wit, and some science all mixed together.
2:24:15
And it’s just an amazing place where we all feel honored and
2:24:22
blessed to be able to just be there.
2:24:29
Back to the question—now describe the succession processes that you observed
2:24:34
and studied and Mount St. Helens.
2:24:37
Starting from the first lupine, or whatever little—
2:24:42
Well, there are lots of ways of viewing succession and one of them
2:24:48
is ecological succession.
2:24:50
Another is sort of social succession and response to big disturbances.
2:24:56
That aspect came into sharp focus both through the history of human reactions
2:25:02
at Mount St. Helens and also at Chaiten Volcano where it erupted violently and
2:25:08
unexpectedly in 2008 in southern Chile.
2:25:14
It’s sort of like stages of grief.
2:25:17
First, denial.
2:25:19
Was that a dream?
2:25:20
What happened?
2:25:23
Then onto gradually on to the acceptance of the reality of it and then
2:25:28
accommodation and finding some of the positive things that it has created.
2:25:34
There are forms of societal succession of feeling, but on ecological
2:25:39
matters it’s been a really amazing thing about Mount St. Helens.
2:25:46
For one thing, we have so many processes, physical, geophysical processes
2:25:52
operating in these very different systems: forest, meadows, shrub fields,
2:25:58
ponds, lakes, streams, and there are gradients within any one of the physical
2:26:06
processes, like the tephra fall.
2:26:10
There’s a gradient from just a trace that didn’t do anything
2:26:15
to fairly severe impacts.
2:26:18
You can work along these disturbance intensity gradients and say well, when
2:26:24
the tephra’s at least this thick, then you lose all the bryophytes, and, if it’s this
2:26:29
thick, then you’re going to lose all the
2:26:35
perennial herbs and so forth.
2:26:38
You have to get at least this thick before you start killing trees
2:26:41
of this species and age class.
2:26:48
What that means is that there’s a tremendously complicated mosaic out
2:26:53
there where the different pieces are on successional pathways of different,
2:27:05
with different degrees of influence of biological legacies, alive and dead, and
2:27:16
trajectories into the future.
2:27:19
Some of the key points that are of interest and surprise to me.
2:27:25
One is that on the erosion front we have some examples where erosion of the
2:27:32
new deposits got down to the old forest soil and one of my key study places that
2:27:39
have a chronosequence of photos in the Mount St. Helens 25th year ecology book,
2:27:49
the erosion got down to the old forest floor and then
2:27:52
stopped for various reasons.
2:27:54
That
2:27:56
made possible the liberation
2:28:03
of buried plant parts from root systems and maybe seeds from the gully floors and
2:28:13
also seeds blowing across the landscape could get trapped in those little gullies,
2:28:19
either just sort of aerodynamically or after the plants had come a ways out
2:28:25
of the gully floors by the plants that are already there trapping the seeds.
2:28:31
And the seed bed of the old forest soil is much superior to that of the
2:28:40
surface of new deposits that don’t have much water holding capacity and
2:28:45
don’t have nutrients worth a damn.
2:28:47
We have pieces of hillside with this vigorous plant growth in years 2,
2:28:54
3, 4, 5 out of these gully floors.
2:28:57
Erosion helping revegetation?
2:29:00
Now, that’s a surprise.
2:29:03
That’s a paradigm shift, at least in common sense understandings, right?
2:29:07
Right.
2:29:08
Then some of the ideas that spilled out of that is there’s a succession
2:29:11
of geophysical processes of erosion and modification of small-scale
2:29:17
landforms over time at the same time biological succession is occurring.
2:29:23
There are interactions between the succession of geophysical processes and
2:29:29
landforms and the succession, biotic succession such that you know vegetation
2:29:39
development can suppress erosion, but erosion can also redistribute seeds
2:29:45
and things of this nature, influencing the patterning of vegetation slope.
2:29:53
That had some practical implications, because the then Soil Conservation
2:29:58
Service, now NRSC [Natural Resources Conservation Service] , wanted to spend
2:30:02
$12 million to spread grass seed over the landscape for erosion control.
2:30:07
This was immediately afterwards, right?
2:30:10
Yes.
2:30:10
This was like they’re going to say, oh my God, we’re going to have mudflows
2:30:13
and floods and we got to seal it up almost like it’s a beach, right?
2:30:17
Right.
2:30:17
We’ll throw a blanket over it.
2:30:20
That idea was entertained by not—?
2:30:24
It was put forward.
2:30:26
The ecologists argued against it because they didn’t want exotic plants spread
2:30:33
widely in the landscape where they were trying to get a National Volcanic Monument
2:30:42
established, but also from the erosion processes perspective and consideration
2:30:48
of the pace of vegetation would likely be developed, it didn’t make much sense
2:30:54
because the first rains would wash the seeds off the slope and it would collect
2:30:59
down in the lower parts of the drainage.
2:31:01
There would be all this grass all over the other area polluting that area and
2:31:05
not doing what they intended it to do.
2:31:07
Right and the major source of sediment was from incision of the major river
2:31:13
channels in the giant landslide deposit where grass seeding is irrelevant
2:31:20
to the dominant erosion processes.
2:31:22
There were theories that became evident in tracking some of these things,
2:31:29
but also there was application that became obvious points of application.
2:31:36
It was interesting that Calbuco volcano just erupted down in the vicinity of
2:31:41
those that we’ve been studying down in Chile, and people have seen some of our
2:31:47
work at St. Helens and from Chaiten, and,
2:31:51
so, owners and managers of the local private park on the north flank of Calbuco
2:31:58
have written to us for advice about
2:32:02
reestablishing forests and things of this nature.
2:32:06
A general issue also is that the notion of restoration
2:32:17
and reestablishment, and there was this strong human instinct from
2:32:24
the engineering point of view we had a beautiful forest here before.
2:32:29
If we can get out there and control erosion and plant trees, we can
2:32:34
hasten the recovery or restoration of this place, but a bunch of the
2:32:40
landscape at Mount St. Helens is so modified we aren’t going back.
2:32:47
For example, right in front of the volcano parts of that area are more than
2:32:51
600-ft higher in elevation than [before the eruption] , and the substrate,
2:32:58
the soil parent material, like the new pumicious pyroclastic flows,
2:33:06
is a long way from being ready to support the kind of
2:33:09
ecosystem that was there before.
2:33:10
Thousands of years.
2:33:11
Yeah.
2:33:14
It’s important to just be attentive to our vocabulary and what it might
2:33:20
reflect in our expectations and how realistic they might be for
2:33:28
the near future of the ecosystem.
2:33:30
SS: Along that train of thought, there was also a lot of salvage logging or
2:33:37
plans to do salvage logging all around, including in private forests, but
2:33:43
certainly National Forest, some of which or a lot of it was in the blast zone.
2:33:48
How did that dynamic play out in terms of the companies and people
2:33:52
wanting to come in and salvage log?
2:33:54
How much did they do?
2:33:55
How did it affect things?
2:33:57
What were the politics surrounding it, especially regarding the science and
2:34:01
the role of science in trying to make sure that didn’t go overboard when they
2:34:07
disagreed it with it for whatever reasons?
2:34:09
Well, there are many interesting facets to that story.
2:34:12
The blast covered about 125 square miles.
2:34:15
Close to the vent
2:34:20
it’s complicated, because you have the giant landslide deposit and other
2:34:24
things within 5, 6, 8 miles of the vent, but pretty close to the vent the
2:34:31
trees were blown away, but over a lot of the area the forest was just toppled.
2:34:37
Some of it had been logged before and some of it was in old, native
2:34:44
forest and young native forest, young post-wildfire native forest.
2:34:50
Then as you got closer to the perimeter of the blast area, the blast had lost its
2:34:56
vigor, dropped the big rock particles,
2:35:04
but was still hot enough, a couple of hundred degrees centigrade,
2:35:10
to scorch the foliage on the conifers, which killed them.
2:35:17
There was this big scorch zone of standing dead.
2:35:22
There was a variety of conditions, and closer to the vent you had
2:35:26
thicker deposits and then, as you went further out the blast trajectories,
2:35:31
the deposits got thinner and thinner, less than a foot, for example.
2:35:40
On the west side of the blast area there was a lot of Weyerhaeuser land
2:35:48
and there was some state land and then some smaller private holdings.
2:35:52
Directly north of the volcano and to the east it was mostly Forest Service.
2:35:59
The section, the square mile, that included the summit actually, belonged
2:36:04
to Burlington Northern Railroad.
2:36:06
It was part of the alternate section ownership scheme.
2:36:09
The summit of the mountain?
2:36:10
The summit, yeah.
2:36:12
Only in America, right?
2:36:15
It was part of the alternate section ownership scheme of the railroads,
2:36:23
trying to encourage development of the West.
2:36:28
So, Weyerhaeuser got going hot and heavy and had something like 20 logging sites
2:36:36
going at a time, so they pulled a lot of their workforce and their resources into
2:36:43
the area to salvage as much as they could as fast as they could before decay set
2:36:49
in and the quality of the wood went down.
2:36:54
Then they trucked out up to 400 log truckloads a day and they had
2:37:00
to truck as far as Springfield, Oregon [SS talks over FS]
2:37:03
. Because they didn’t have the mills the process it.
2:37:03
--to find the mill capacity.
2:37:08
That was a wild and wooly time and then call people in off desk jobs to help
2:37:15
with the planting of all this acreage.
2:37:18
Meanwhile the Forest Service was putting up timber sales, but did it
2:37:25
more slowly in its bureaucratic context.
2:37:29
On the east side of the blast zone, like in the Clearwater drainage they
2:37:32
had a bunch of in parts of Bean Creek and off in Green River country to the
2:37:38
northeast they had a bunch of sales, some of them were helicopter sales.
2:37:45
That took a while and then you were into ’82 and ’83 and there
2:37:48
was a real downturn in the market.
2:37:51
It was a bubble.
2:37:53
People had been bidding up $600, $700,
2:37:58
$800 per thousand boardfeet
2:38:05
and then the market crashed and so people were holding onto these
2:38:10
sales and it wasn’t standing green timber, it was down dead timber
2:38:15
and so if there was [SS interrupts]
2:38:17
. Eventually you had to get it, or it would rot, and you couldn’t use it.
2:38:18
Yeah.
2:38:20
So, there were a lot of goofy shenanigans.
2:38:25
Meanwhile
2:38:28
the extent and the boundaries of the National Volcanic Monument
2:38:31
were being negotiated and disputed.
2:38:34
Crowell, who was a Secretary of Ag at the time [SS interrupts]
2:38:42
. Under Reagan.
2:38:43
Under Reagan was from Louisiana Pacific Timber and a lawyer, he wanted a small
2:38:48
monument and then environmentalists were pushing for a big monument.
2:38:53
I remember
2:38:57
the science group, a few of us, like Jerry and Jim and me giving some
2:39:01
input on it, and we had this one idea of having a corridor that ran from
2:39:09
the crater north all the way through the blast zone and into green timber
2:39:16
and one that went to the northeast
2:39:21
out into green timber, but on the northeast one there was the heaviest
2:39:26
tephra fall on the green forest, whereas to the north there was minimal
2:39:30
tephra fall in the green forest.
2:39:31
That damaged the soils enough to hurt the trees, right?
2:39:36
It affected the forest vegetation, particularly the understory.
2:39:40
Okay.
2:39:41
So, some of the thinking did find its way, I think, into, at least it’s
2:39:50
apparent, in the boundaries of the National Volcanic Monument, which also
2:39:55
was the boundaries were gerrymandered to take in other places that had,
2:40:00
you know like the Mount Margaret high country that environmentalists had been
2:40:05
advocating for wilderness designation.
2:40:08
It was up high [elevation] . It didn’t have timber value, although
2:40:13
there were mining claim issues.
2:40:15
There was a lot of complexity there.
2:40:17
There was a bunch of land trades between Weyerhaeuser and the Forest Service,
2:40:23
and maybe the state forestry, to
2:40:29
try to get a meaningful monument and deal with a bunch of other land ownership.
2:40:37
Political realities.
2:40:37
Yeah.
2:40:40
There was a bunch of salvage logging,
2:40:48
but then a lot was left out there.
2:40:51
The problem must have been a lot of the roads were covered up or destroyed, right?
2:40:56
Yes.
2:40:56
And that’s access for you guys doing science, but also for any of the timber
2:41:02
people as well, even more so for them.
2:41:03
Yeah, and also for public access for interpretive programs.
2:41:11
The road system was gradually reopened and then after a while,
2:41:16
after the salvaging was completed, then there were some storms.
2:41:21
The road system was beat up by storms, floods, and some of it was not reopened.
2:41:31
It’s interesting to note there is a bunch of issues about the continuing management
2:41:37
of the Monument, and, so, in the Monument Act it says that natural processes
2:41:43
should proceed substantially unimpeded,
2:41:47
which is quite a wild concept for the US Congress, but there were and there
2:41:59
remain, still, very tricky issues there.
2:42:04
One has to do with drainage of the lakes, the new lakes, like Castle Lake and
2:42:13
Coldwater Lake and the preexisting lake of Spirit Lake, and there was concern
2:42:22
that these are lakes that have new blockages by the landslide deposit, which
2:42:29
was very unstable, including issues such as it included some pieces of glaciers.
2:42:38
There had been 13 named glaciers around the summit.
2:42:42
Then these melted out over subsequent years, forming cavities in these dams.
2:42:48
The big chunks of ice were still just sitting down there.
2:42:51
They were embedded within the debris avalanche.
2:42:54
They were just so massive they just didn’t melt.
2:42:56
They had to melt slowly, even though they were 3 or 4,000 feet or maybe
2:43:01
6,000 feet or more in some cases, right?
2:43:06
Some thousands of feet lower, and,
2:43:11
so, then they constructed stable outlets for Coldwater.
2:43:18
They created an outlet over bedrock.
2:43:21
I’m not sure exactly how the design goes for the Castle one, and then for Spirit,
2:43:30
after some interesting arguments, they ended up drilling a mile-long tunnel
2:43:36
and emptying Spirit Lake out through Coldwater Creek, but now there’s a
2:43:46
problem, because parts of the tunnel are in unstable material that had 30 years
2:43:52
to pick up water and clays have expanded, and the tunnel is being constricted.
2:44:00
One
2:44:02
thing I heard is there’s a $10 million job to stabilize the tunnel.
2:44:08
The concern is, if Spirit Lake were to flow over the landslide deposit, it could
2:44:15
end up creating a monstrous mudflow.
2:44:18
And having another version of what happened in 1980.
2:44:22
Right and in the geologic record down valley there are suggestions
2:44:29
that that happened in the past.
2:44:31
Another big issue, which isn’t so much a public safety one, is
2:44:37
fishing in lakes.
2:44:39
There are 30 some lakes that are alpine lakes, which had been stocked
2:44:46
and fished before the eruption.
2:44:48
The Forest Service owns the land and manages the habitat.
2:44:51
The state manages the fish.
2:44:55
The state is very fish and game oriented.
2:45:00
This is a state vs.
2:45:03
federal [SS interrupts]
2:45:04
. State versus federal rights thing, right?
2:45:05
Yeah.
2:45:05
Now what happened [FS continues]
2:45:08
. But let me finish this—part of it is, so there was sort of a compromise where
2:45:13
only a few lakes would be left fishless and others would be stocked, and Spirit
2:45:19
Lake was one to be left fishless.
2:45:22
But, then, after some years somebody illegally stocked Spirit Lake, and,
2:45:28
because of its peculiar ecology, monstrous fish have grown, and, then,
2:45:34
the fishing groups were really eager to get in after these trophy fish.
2:45:39
The Forest Service didn’t want them in.
2:45:41
For one thing, there’s big floating log mat and it’s quite a dangerous place.
2:45:46
Another thing is the ecologists didn’t want them in there.
2:45:49
So, they’re still not in there?
2:45:53
Official fishing is not in there.
2:45:57
The fish are still in there, although the fish have been getting
2:46:00
smaller progressively year by year, and Charlie is tracking this.
2:46:05
There are several competing hypotheses.
2:46:08
Are there mutations because of weird chemical mixes, or?
2:46:12
It may be that there was abundant food relative to
2:46:19
the fish population and there may be some other things.
2:46:27
Looking at 35 years of post-1980 ecological research at Mount St.
2:46:31
Helens, how would you rate or compare research and findings in terms of their
2:46:34
importance to understanding ecosystem processes and their respective impacts
2:46:40
on ecology and ecosystem science?
2:46:44
If you were just going to say what are some of the really
2:46:47
important findings and why?
2:46:52
Well, I think that now that we’re 35 years out, some of these things
2:46:58
we picked up on quite early,
2:47:02
some of them are still being refined.
2:47:09
There are a number of themes, like the importance of biological
2:47:12
legacies and what they can do.
2:47:16
The importance of timing at the scale of time of day, time of year,
2:47:22
or phenology, seasonality, the stage of succession of the affected
2:47:27
season—all of these temporal scales need to be brought into the fore and
2:47:37
then the importance of work on disturbance gradients and the importance of
2:47:42
thinking about disturbance mechanisms as distinguished from disturbance
2:47:47
types, a disturbance type being something like mudflow or a volcanic
2:47:54
blast, a disturbance mechanism being things like degree of heating,
2:48:02
depth of deposition [SS interrupts]
2:48:05
. The mechanics of erosion, what have you?
2:48:07
Yeah, the vigor of abrasion,
2:48:10
impact force that may lead to toppling of trees, for example.
2:48:15
These are all
2:48:19
concepts that have come into sharp focus from the Mount St. Helens
2:48:24
experience and then comparing the Mount St. Helens lessons with those from
2:48:29
other volcanoes or places like the Andrews and non-volcanic disturbances.
2:48:35
Another thing relative to succession and having the opportunity to track
2:48:39
things year by year and now for 35 years is just all the goofy little
2:48:48
things that can happen along the way.
2:48:51
There’s not a single or simple trajectory of successional change.
2:48:57
You so modify the landscape that there are physical changes that
2:49:02
continue to occur in the landscape and then there are biotic changes.
2:49:07
For example, a willow took off pretty strong in a bunch of areas, but
2:49:12
then there’s a willow borer larvae that’s munching, a stem borer, that’s
2:49:19
really knocking the willows back.
2:49:22
Or, if you’re studying a particular plot and a herd of elk comes through and
2:49:26
eats all the lupines and poops all over the place, it can set the successional
2:49:31
trajectory off in a new direction.
2:49:33
It was interesting talking with the photographer Gary Braasch, who
2:49:37
was photographing there during the eruption, one of the photographers
2:49:41
who fortunately survived.
2:49:43
He’s doing a bunch of chronosequence photography and he said oh he was
2:49:47
sort of miffed when he got back to one of his chronosequence sites, and
2:49:55
it was all messed up, because of elk going through.
2:49:58
There are all these secondary disturbances that can cause adjustments
2:50:03
in the trajectories of change.
2:50:10
What has surprised you the most about what research has revealed at Mount
2:50:15
St. Helens and ecosystem processes?
2:50:22
Well, interesting surprises keep coming along and they
2:50:27
come along in different ways.
2:50:31
An early one was: wow, the erosion of the new deposits was actually
2:50:36
a positive in terms of getting some plant cover back in the land.
2:50:39
It took a particular set of circumstances, you know confluence of 3, 4, 5 sets of
2:50:45
circumstances that made that possible.
2:50:48
After you realize them all, then it’s like, oh, well it’s not a surprise.
2:50:52
In retrospect, it’s understandable that I was, and others were surprised.
2:50:59
But it also, it influenced some of the management decisions.
2:51:06
Then, when it came time to replant those places that I mentioned in our
2:51:11
discussion of salvage logging, that was part of the motivation for making sure
2:51:19
that the roots of the plant and seedlings reached into the pre-eruption soil.
2:51:26
One thing that has impressed me, I wouldn’t say surprise because at
2:51:31
least at this stage of my career I’ve seen enough examples of stuff that
2:51:36
seems like a very basic finding, ends up having interesting application.
2:51:42
Two key examples from that are things that Jerry Franklin has worked on
2:51:49
where the early aha moment of the biological legacies of seeing the
2:51:55
fireweed emerge from the cracked surface of the new deposits [SS interrupts]
2:52:01
. When you thought it had been so incinerated and so destroyed that how
2:52:05
could this happen so quick, right?
2:52:06
Right, and it was there in the first few months in the summer of 1980 led to you
2:52:13
know his thinking about “new forestry” and put more attention to what we leave and
2:52:18
what we take, and it had a big influence on a policy in forest management.
2:52:23
Then 20, 25
2:52:30
years later, viewing the very slow succession in the area in front of the
2:52:37
volcano and yet it’s a very rich community with a lot of diversity in the plant
2:52:46
component, hence in the lepidoptera and bird and other components of the system,
2:52:52
led him to change his thinking about the nature and the value of early-successional
2:53:01
plant communities, ecosystems, and how we need to be attentive to that
2:53:07
in the forest management arena.
2:53:09
And he uses this in the context of his current efforts with his colleague
2:53:14
the policy expert Norm Johnson to pitch for what they call “ecological
2:53:22
forestry,” which at the landscape level includes wanting to have some
2:53:27
early-serial habitat be present for the broader landscape objective
2:53:33
of retaining biological diversity.
2:53:36
That was a lesson from the great Zen mistress Mount St. Helens.
2:53:41
Now, he used the concept metastasized to describe the spread of organisms
2:53:51
in opposition to the traditional metaphor or construct to describe
2:53:57
ecological succession, which was waves.
2:54:02
Is that how you would describe that yourself?
2:54:06
This was the part of the landscape ecological perspectives as
2:54:12
applied to Mount St. Helens.
2:54:13
It’s interesting the two key concepts are frames of ecology.
2:54:20
One is landscape ecology and the other is disturbance ecology.
2:54:26
The major textbooks, the major books for the U.S. in both of those areas came out
2:54:37
I think it was ’85 and ’86, five, six years after Mount St. Helens erupted.
2:54:43
I don’t think that they were informed by Mount St. Helens, knowing
2:54:52
their authors, editors [they were very east coast kinds of guys].
2:54:58
But it’s interesting that those views of the world, landscape ecology and
2:55:05
disturbance ecology, have really been taking off, and Mount St. Helens I think
2:55:15
has had a role in shaping that thinking.
2:55:17
So, metastasis versus waves, you know, like in the blast zone my impression
2:55:25
is that we haven’t had a real strong landscape perspective looking at
2:55:31
development of the landscape over time in a rigorous research kind of sense, but
2:55:39
what you can see out there is, especially looking across the blast area, there
2:55:45
were sites that were rich in legacies.
2:55:51
There are many little hot spots.
2:55:54
Rather than just waiting for the march inward from the periphery
2:55:59
of the vegetation [SS interrupts]
2:56:00
. Which is the traditional model and expectation that people trained
2:56:04
in ecology, like Jerry, would have thought at the time, correct?
2:56:07
Right.
2:56:10
There are many different things going on out there and the
2:56:14
metastasis is the notion of zones of infection or hot spots that then
2:56:22
plant and animal species can spread out from.
2:56:26
We have residual hot spots and legacy sites and then we have invader hot
2:56:32
spots where new communities are forming by immigration from outside, and then
2:56:39
they can expand and maybe coalesce.
2:56:44
We’ve got a lot of different things going on out there in
2:56:47
different parts of the landscape.
2:56:53
In your view what ecological research remains undone at Mount St. Helens?
2:57:00
Well, as I just mentioned I think we need, and the time is probably just
2:57:06
getting really ripe for it, some of these things we had to wait for them to be
2:57:10
nicely manifest on the landscape, and my first example would be a good landscape
2:57:16
ecological investigation, using remote sensing in any of the plots that we have
2:57:23
that are useful and may be necessary to have some field sampling, but a lot of it
2:57:29
could be with remote sensing in existing plots and look at how the landscape
2:57:34
is being assembled and configured.
2:57:39
I know there’s been some of that done.
2:57:40
There’s been some, yeah.
2:57:45
That’s one thing.
2:57:46
Another thing is just make sure we keep doing what we’re doing because change is
2:57:51
occurring both endogenously by succession, but also changes are being imposed by
2:58:02
new disturbances for example or invasions of new species, exotic or
2:58:07
native, and then are we going to have a wolf wander in some day and change
2:58:13
the behavior of the elk, which are an important component of the ecosystem?
2:58:20
We’ve got wolves wandering into the Cascades in Oregon and you know there
2:58:27
are two mating pairs, or at least there’s ORR-7 and his mate [SS interrupts]
2:58:31
. Where are
2:58:34
they now?
2:58:35
They’re in southern Oregon and they have their pups, but at least one
2:58:39
more has shown up down there, and, so
2:58:45
the Mount St. Helens landscape is interesting because that private land
2:58:49
is now heavily, densely forested in young planted forest, especially to
2:58:54
the west in the Weyerhaeuser land.
2:58:57
The open area is sort of being constrained and there are a lot of elk in there.
2:59:01
If we get some wolves in there and it changes elk behavior, that
2:59:06
could have some interesting play.
2:59:07
Plus, how’s climate change going to play?
2:59:10
There are a bunch of aspects of wanting to take on new studies of
2:59:18
things that are clearly being manifest in the landscape that weren’t early
2:59:25
– continuing the existing work and ask if we’re making the right kinds of
2:59:30
observations to see the effects of some of these new components of the system.
2:59:37
In the comparative context, how have any of these lessons learned at St.
2:59:42
Helens been applied to the research and understanding of Lassen Peak and
2:59:47
its eruptive cycle, which is the other U.S. historic period major eruption?
2:59:54
I don’t really know anything about that.
2:59:56
I don’t know of any, if there’s any research at Lassen.
3:00:02
I’m talking about ecology, though.
3:00:05
I guess there, yeah, I see that there are two published papers
3:00:14
on Lassen, the last one in 2000.
3:00:17
I just don’t
3:00:21
know anything about that.
3:00:29
What is your impression about the research on St. Helens preceding 1980?
3:00:35
How it might have compared to other volcanoes in the Cascade Range
3:00:38
in terms of scientific interest?
3:00:43
Across the disciplines.
3:00:46
Whatever comes to mind.
3:00:48
Well, a very interesting feature is that Mount St. Helens had been
3:00:53
recognized as a very active volcano and
3:01:05
Dwight [“Rocky”] Crandell and Don Mullineaux, USGS tephra
3:01:14
stratigraphers, people who study the
3:01:19
volcano excrement, detritus from the volcano.
3:01:24
If you look at the topographic map of the larger Mount St. Helens area, it’s
3:01:29
really evident how the surrounding landscape, which had been carved by
3:01:34
glaciers and other processes, has been substantially inundated by detritus
3:01:40
from the Mount St. Helens vent over the previous tens of thousands of
3:01:47
years, although the cone itself was
3:01:51
dominantly or maybe exclusive of
3:01:55
only the last 4,000 years or so.
3:02:03
Anyway, Crandell and Mullineaux had been doing a very detailed history of
3:02:10
the eruptions of St. Helens and the shedding of various flowage deposits.
3:02:22
I remember going on a field trip there that they led with the Pacific Cell
3:02:27
of the Friends of the Pleistocene.
3:02:30
Pacific Cell of the Friends of the Pleistocene?
3:02:33
Yes.
3:02:34
Okay.
3:02:35
I just wanted to make sure I got that.
3:02:37
Can I join?
3:02:39
Sure.
3:02:40
I remember camping out along one of the big reservoirs on the south side
3:02:47
and going up and looking at some of the thick deposits that are exposed
3:02:53
in the deep cuts of the streams that flow off the south flank of St. Helens
3:03:05
and they published a U.S. Geological Survey bulletin.
3:03:08
It was 1978.
3:03:11
It said something like we expect that there will be another significant
3:03:16
eruption in the next century, possibly before the end of this century.
3:03:21
Very prescient.
3:03:23
Based
3:03:26
on the eruptive history in 1980 it had been 123 years since there had
3:03:32
been a burp, you know, so I think it was quite well-known in that regard.
3:03:37
It was probably typical of a lot of the Cascade volcanoes on the ecology
3:03:44
front and, perhaps, with D.B. Lawrence’s several publications, it might have
3:03:49
been one of the more studied in an academic sense on the ecology front.
3:03:59
I don’t know about the scientific publications for places like Spirit
3:04:02
Lake in the limnological world.
3:04:05
There may have been.
3:04:06
The reason I ask is that my impression would be that just because humans tend
3:04:11
to gravitate towards the biggest and the most spectacular that I would think that
3:04:15
there’d be more studies done at Rainier, for instance, and you know glaciology,
3:04:20
certainly, but a lot of other areas too, Baker perhaps, and Hood, too, and lesser
3:04:28
maybe on some of the Oregon volcanoes.
3:04:36
Is there a comprehensive bibliography reference for Mount St. Helens?
3:04:43
I am not sure what its status is.
3:04:47
I expect Charlie has one.
3:04:49
There were several efforts early to produce them and publish them
3:04:56
and the USGS may have something on the geo front, so I’m not sure.
3:05:03
The State of Washington may have quite a bit, but there may have been
3:05:07
some slacking off after a while.
3:05:15
Since St. Helens produced the most explosive eruption in the U.S. since
3:05:19
the republic’s conception, how do you believe that the eruptions, plural, of
3:05:23
St. Helens have affected people’s views about geology and history in the U.S.,
3:05:29
but, especially, in the Pacific Northwest?
3:05:34
Well, I’m only guessing, but I think it’s important that
3:05:44
the people be reminded of
3:05:49
in some ways our tenuous hold on the surface of the earth, that
3:05:56
in other big earthquakes and their volcanic eruptions
3:06:00
and their monstrous storms,
3:06:05
so it’s important for us to be humbled and be reminded that we
3:06:10
aren’t in control of everything.
3:06:17
This was a very dramatic reminder.
3:06:21
It’s somewhat unique in
3:06:25
the history of Euro presence.
3:06:27
There have been some really bad hurricane impacts.
3:06:32
Floods.
3:06:34
Tornados all the time.
3:06:35
Yeah.
3:06:37
We’ve had some bad earthquake damage, but we haven’t had the big
3:06:43
Northwest subduction zone earthquake and we probably haven’t had
3:06:49
a big San Andreas one in the San Francisco Bay area really that will be arriving
3:06:56
soon, especially given the nature of development in those areas since there
3:07:03
the last ones of any significance.
3:07:03
Anyway, I do think “nature bats last” is
3:07:07
an
3:07:14
important reminder.
3:07:15
They’re the home team.
3:07:16
I
3:07:18
thought you didn’t like baseball.
3:07:22
Okay.
3:07:25
Mount St. Helens is certainly a powerful, physical place, but it is also a cultural
3:07:30
place with a range of human connections, attachments, and interpretations based
3:07:34
on individual and group experience.
3:07:37
Referencing your personal experience, how would you characterize your sense
3:07:41
of place in regards to Mount St. Helens?
3:07:46
Well, I haven’t considered sense of place in a real scholarly manner.
3:07:54
I sense it more in my gut and
3:08:00
I really am attracted to the landscape.
3:08:06
I can just sit and stare at it and try to comprehend it, sometimes
3:08:12
in an analytical, geomorphology,
3:08:15
ecology, geology sense, and other times just
3:08:21
taking in the textures and colors and so forth.
3:08:25
I’m also intrigued by its
3:08:29
role as an icon of our bioregion and telling us about our volcanoes.
3:08:36
That’s an important theme to me for the kinds of work that we do at places
3:08:42
like Mount St. Helens and the Andrews where we study our bioregional icons
3:08:49
of ancient forest and cold clear rivers and volcanoes; and I have this hope that
3:09:02
our kinds of work in science and increasingly in arts and humanities
3:09:06
in these places will help the public also respect them and
3:09:13
understand their complexities and
3:09:18
the non-technical ways of engaging with them and have this sense that will give us
3:09:28
as a society more motivation and umpf to
3:09:36
take good care of them, not just those places but the natural world in general.
3:09:45
I just think that these are super important places and that our work
3:09:50
has already and hopefully more so in the future influenced how
3:09:58
the public perceives the world.
3:10:03
In that regard, I’ll go ahead and go on into my
3:10:09
arts and humanities take.
3:10:13
I remember
3:10:16
early after the eruption being a little appalled at how it was being treated in
3:10:24
such a narrow manner in terms of death and destruction in the early days, and
3:10:29
yet I could get to go in there with the luxury of being a science type
3:10:39
and just how amazing and beautiful and special it was, how awe-inspiring.
3:10:46
I had this fantasy of trying to write a grant to the National Endowment for the
3:10:50
Humanities and/or Arts and try to get enough money to get half a dozen artists
3:10:57
and writers to come up to Mount St. Helens and drop them off in the Pumice
3:11:04
Plain with a bit helicopter [support] and let them sit there and [SS interrupts]
3:11:08
. Ponder.
3:11:08
Ponder and paint and write and drop their jaws.
3:11:15
Of course, that never happened, but 20 years later
3:11:20
do to a chance circumstance I had the good fortune to go up there for 3 days
3:11:28
with a poet, Gary Snyder, whose work I had been very interested in since
3:11:37
college days, undergraduate days, and I was interested in his work and
3:11:43
his perceptions of landscapes and our place in them and other poets, such
3:11:53
as one his mentors, Kenneth Rexroth.
3:11:59
I felt like, as a field scientist, I had an opportunity to experience little
3:12:03
poetic moments out in the land and in other circumstances, and I was intrigued
3:12:10
with how they [the poets] received them and what they did with them.
3:12:14
Anyway, in 2000 I got to go out [at Mount St. Helens] with Gary Snyder and
3:12:18
that really helped set me up to work with my colleagues on the humanities
3:12:27
front, especially Kathy [Kathleen Dean] Moore and now Charles Goodrich
3:12:31
of the Spring Creek Project for Ideas, Nature, and the Written Word,
3:12:38
as we couple humanities [and increasingly arts] and ecology to understand
3:12:48
some of the dimensions of these places.
3:12:52
In 2005, 2010 and later this summer, later this month, we’ll take groups
3:13:02
of writers and a few artists and combine with a large group of
3:13:08
scientists out to Mount St. Helens and
3:13:17
explore new ways of knowing and sensing these places.
3:13:22
I’m pleased with the book In the Blast Zone that has 20 some
3:13:30
authors contributing.
3:13:31
It came out from the
3:13:35
2005 Pulse and that that’s for sale at the Johnston Ridge Observatory.
3:13:41
I think some of the poems are used in interpretive programs, and I recently
3:13:46
took part in a middle school program in Vancouver, Washington, where the kids had
3:13:53
been reading in that book and then they did a big project about Mount St. Helens.
3:13:58
Their teacher has a master’s degree in history and oral history specialty, and
3:14:06
he was so stoked to have, you know, people like Charlie Crisafulli and me, who are
3:14:14
veterans of some of these things, and we gave comments and we were interviewed.
3:14:19
How stoked were the students?
3:14:21
Oh, the students seemed quite stoked and they produced a very nice webpage
3:14:25
or multiple webpages of the work they had done, which included the
3:14:31
interviewing and videoing, and inquiries that they had made on their own.
3:14:38
They clearly read parts of In the Blast Zone book.
3:14:42
Would you sense that maybe a past generation or two generations would
3:14:47
almost look at St. Helens in the glass is half empty context more often
3:14:53
than not versus young kids who did not ever see its perfect symmetrical
3:14:57
cone and they didn’t have those long memories of Spirit Lake and hiking
3:15:01
and camping or whatever in that area?
3:15:04
I did sense a bipolar polar opposite responses early on
3:15:10
of the people [SS interrupts]
3:15:11
. Not bipolar, polar.
3:15:14
They were off their lithium, right?
3:15:15
[Laughs]
3:15:16
. There were polarized responses early on, where people who felt they had lost so
3:15:25
much, didn’t want to go back, but others, people like myself and Charlie for whom it
3:15:34
was like a playground, you’re eager to go.
3:15:38
Christine Colasurdo, who was on our previous Pulses, she has her
3:15:43
book, Return to Spirit Lake, which is from that sense of loss side.
3:15:50
But that’s easy to see why.
3:15:53
You look at the beauty, it’s almost Fujiyama-esque in its pre-eruption sense.
3:15:59
It’s very, very iconic.
3:16:02
Yeah, but Charlie just forwarded me
3:16:09
an email that he’d gotten from a high-powered STEM student from
3:16:13
Seattle that had come to Mount St. Helens and he spent a Saturday
3:16:16
with him, and she was so stoked.
3:16:19
Thank you so much.
3:16:21
You’ve transformed my life!
3:16:23
Just to see your excitement and all the amazing ecological
3:16:27
stories, it’s just so exciting.
3:16:29
You
3:16:33
do get the sense that it’s a place that’s impacting these new generations
3:16:39
who have had a very different context of experience with it.
3:16:44
Right.
3:16:49
Exactly.
3:16:49
From the perspective of a geologist and ecologist, is Mount St. Helens
3:16:52
more beautiful now, post-eruption, than before when its graceful,
3:16:57
symmetrical cone symbolized a traditional alpine mountain aesthetic?
3:17:03
That’s a loaded question.
3:17:05
From my perspective, and the reason I’m still doing this stuff while I’m 3 ½
3:17:13
years into retirement [retirement means you’re doing stuff because you love it]
3:17:21
is because it’s sort of to pay back for all that Mount St. Helens gave me.
3:17:30
I think we’ve got a lot of beautiful volcanoes out there, and Mount St.
3:17:37
Helens has a very special place because of her behavior and all of the lessons
3:17:44
that she spewed across the landscape.
3:17:49
Now we’re learning so much and we’re so attracted and have this amazing
3:17:58
stage for conveying stories and look at this pile of books we have here.
3:18:06
Yes, there were sacrifices, like in Richard Waite’s book.
3:18:10
It’s about the people who were directly killed and then a bunch
3:18:15
of eyewitnesses who suffered and family members who suffered loss.
3:18:22
Whole families were killed just killed in a couple of cases, right?
3:18:24
Yeah.
3:18:24
Like they were out there camping in the red zone and they got just [mouth noise]
3:18:28
. Yeah.
3:18:28
Or even outside the red zone.
3:18:35
I think it’s a very special place
3:18:41
in aggregate and I’m glad it’s there.
3:18:44
Taking the phrase made famous by Wallace Stegner, Geography of Hope, how would you
3:18:52
apply that to St. Helens and its environs?
3:18:56
Well, I think it applies in several respects, the resilience of life
3:19:04
is so amazing and some components of the system, like some of the
3:19:10
water bodies, just came back.
3:19:15
They did recover in the sense of you know many of the components
3:19:22
of the ecosystem are back there.
3:19:26
Life is vibrant and complex and making interesting things happen.
3:19:34
I think in terms of human perception and attitude succession, we move beyond
3:19:46
disbelief and despair, and now you go to the Johnston Ridge Observatory.
3:19:53
I like going there.
3:19:55
For me it’s as fascinating to look and listen to the people.
3:19:59
What’s your impression about how, or just some of the responses that you
3:20:04
could maybe characterize or remember right now from what you hear and listen?
3:20:08
I was just up there with
3:20:12
two Chileans and a Canadian,
3:20:17
a South African via Canada, I took them up there for a day and just told stories.
3:20:23
We went to the visitor center and we went to some of the lookout places and were
3:20:28
just eating lunch and overhearing people.
3:20:32
I’m fascinated hearing people speaking German and Japanese and Chinese.
3:20:37
It’s a global phenomenon.
3:20:45
I went to the movie that I’ve seen video 16 minutes; I’ve seen it a bunch of times.
3:20:51
Some of it stuff was filed during the last Pulse, and we
3:20:57
interacted with the producer.
3:20:59
In
3:21:05
the Blast Zone book is on the counter there.
3:21:12
Then I overhear people telling other people, other citizens
3:21:20
taking visitors out there
3:21:28
or reading the interpretive signs or having discussions where
3:21:32
both members of the conversation are present for the first time.
3:21:38
I’m impressed.
3:21:39
People are sophisticated in getting stories.
3:21:43
They’re engaged.
3:21:44
Yeah.
3:21:46
Generally speaking, the visitation there is not that high compared to a
3:21:50
lot of other places, or is that untrue?
3:21:54
I don’t know how the numbers stack up, but I think they have
3:21:57
several hundred thousand per year.
3:22:01
It looks well-visited.
3:22:05
Before St. Helens erupted, what was your favorite volcano in the Cascades and why?
3:22:17
I don’t know that I had a favorite.
3:22:19
I climbed Hood a couple of times and Shasta and at least Middle Sister.
3:22:27
I sort of like the Sisters.
3:22:29
They were three right together and they had a nice glacier and it was nearby.
3:22:34
Hood
3:22:40
really stands up and stands out.
3:22:42
I
3:22:44
like that.
3:22:45
Ever climbed Rainier?
3:22:47
No.
3:22:48
That’s a dangerous mountain, actually.
3:22:49
Yeah.
3:22:51
A lot of people get killed on that mountain.
3:22:52
Yeah.
3:22:54
Okay, we’re going to sign off for now for phase 2 of our conversation about Mount
3:23:01
St. Helens ecosystem science, geology, etc., and the arts and humanities.
3:23:06
We will probably have a third session at some time, Fred, I would
3:23:10
anticipate, but we are going to sign
3:23:18
off for right now.
