00:07
My name is Sara Khatib and this research is for my master's thesis.
00:10
The research involves history of different traditions of science at the
00:14
Andrews Forest and the philosophical perceptions of nature that underlie
00:17
these different traditions.
00:19
I would like to ask you a few open-ended questions regarding these topics.
00:23
I expect the duration of the interview to take up to one hour to complete
00:28
but maybe up to two hours, depending on your interest and knowledge.
00:31
Would you like to participate in this interview?
00:33
Yes, I would.
00:36
We can end the interview at any point you wish to do so.
00:40
Please inform me right away if you no longer want to participate and
00:43
the interview will immediately end.
00:44
Do I have permission to record this interview?
00:47
Yes.
00:50
Okay.
00:51
Before we begin, I want to offer a brief summary as to why we are here today.
00:55
As you know, there is currently a collection of oral histories in the Oregon
00:59
State University Special Collections and Archives Research Center titled, "Voices
01:03
of the Forest, Voices of the Mills." That collection consists of stories on people's
01:08
backgrounds and how their journeys have led them to the Andrews Forest.
01:12
It also consists of stories that illustrate certain political and cultural
01:15
transitions, such as the transition away from the timber era to the conservation
01:20
era and the planning for the Pacific Northwest Forest Plan and discusses
01:24
the overall culture of LTER [Long-Term Ecological Research] . Today we are here
01:27
to build from that by asking more direct questions about your personal philosophy
01:31
and practice of science and then scale up to the philosophy and practice
01:34
of science on the community level.
01:37
This interview will inform the writing of my master's thesis, where my research
01:40
questions ask 1] what are the different traditions of science that characterize
01:44
the Andrews community and 2] what are the philosophies of nature that
01:47
underlie these different traditions?
01:49
We are here today with Dr. Sherri Johnson who joined the Andrews Forest community
01:53
in 1996 as a post-doc after receiving her Ph.D. from the University of Missoula.
01:59
Since then, she's become a forest scientist [SLJ interrupts]
02:01
. The University of Oklahoma.
02:03
Oh, Oklahoma.
02:03
Thank you for the clarification.
02:05
Since then, she's been a forest scientist with lead responsibility
02:10
for Andrews Forest and the LTER community on the whole.
02:13
Her research involves landscape influences on streams and in 2018, Dr. Johnson
02:19
received the USFS Inspiring Woman Award.
02:22
I'm glad to have you here today.
02:24
Are you ready to begin?
02:26
Yep.
02:27
Just to clarify, I was a post-doc.
02:29
I was officially hired by the Forest Service not until 2001.
02:36
Okay, gotcha.
02:36
Sounds good.
02:37
Thank you.
02:39
The first set of questions inquire about your perception of an ecosystem
02:44
and your personal philosophy and take on scientific research as well
02:48
as the way you perceive nature may influence your scientific approach.
02:54
The first question I want to begin with is how would you define an ecosystem?
02:58
Yeah, that's an interesting question to have to step back
03:01
and go-because we use the term.
03:03
It's very popular.
03:05
In Frank Golley's-retrospective it's apparent that these ideas cycle in
03:12
about 30-year cycles and so he wrote his book in the early '90s, so we're
03:17
coming back now 30 years later, whether it's generational or whatever.
03:24
Everything gets attributed to ecosystems these days.
03:27
When I went back to think about looking at these, it really is just ecology:
03:32
interaction between organisms and their environment, but in a systematic
03:37
way is what many of the definitions.
03:40
So, I had to go look it up again to see exactly how I use it versus.
03:46
I think it involves much more processes in a systematic way.
03:49
Sometimes ecology can just be
03:54
interactions and focus more on the species, where ecosystems to
03:59
me involve some of the processes including biology, chemical, climatic,
04:07
and hydrologic - much more than straight ecology might.
04:12
Okay.
04:15
It's almost like community ecology.
04:17
I come from the hierarchy: populations, ecosystems-or, communities, ecosystems
04:23
and so they're all being pulled.
04:25
Because ecology can just even be at a population level.
04:30
Would you say ecosystems emphasize more of the abiotic components as well and
04:35
their interactions with the biotic?
04:37
Well, I take more as a systematic, which suggests processes.
04:42
There may be processes in the ecology, but I tend to think of it also as
04:50
generally at a larger spatial scale.
04:54
Okay.
04:56
But more than just one or two species, or even just one community.
05:00
It's multiple communities, multiple processes.
05:06
How would you describe the nature of an ecosystem?
05:09
Is it static?
05:10
Is it dynamic?
05:11
Orderly?
05:12
Chaotic?
05:12
I come from a disturbance background, so I think of very little as being static.
05:19
Brittle versus fragile is an interesting idea, but I tend to think of resilient
05:26
versus fragile or resilient versus resistant is probably a little bit more.
05:33
That so depends on-it's very site-dependent.
05:38
I can think of systems that are very fragile or not resilient and
05:44
systems that are very resilient and
05:50
whether or not they are native or anthropogenic systems.
05:55
I don't think it's just-I don't think we can characterize
05:58
the nature of an ecosystem.
06:00
I think it has to be ecosystem specific.
06:03
Interesting.
06:03
Okay.
06:04
So, particular to a specific ecosystem, do you have any examples or
06:11
hypotheticals to demonstrate what you would perceive as a more resilient?
06:15
I think of the Andrews with its large, old growth as fairly resilient.
06:21
We have a lot of biomass.
06:23
There are big trees that are long-lived.
06:27
It takes a lot-the ecosystem has a lot of inertia to continue kind of
06:32
like it is because of the longevity I think of the species, because of
06:39
the climate, because of the geology.
06:42
It takes a lot to really move our ecosystem into a disturbed mode.
06:47
Different ecosystems:
06:52
young forests, plantations are very different.
06:56
Agricultural systems are really different.
06:59
They're already so modified, but then they can still be very resilient, because
07:03
they're so modified and simplified, such as agricultural, the grass fields
07:07
here in the valley or something.
07:09
Or they can be unique still but, as forest ecosystems go, as I think
07:17
of the difference, I've worked in some young plantations and more
07:22
industrial lands and see quite a bit of difference between those systems
07:26
and the Andrews system overall.
07:29
Interesting.
07:31
In terms of what about the plantations that replaced the old
07:34
growth in the Pacific Northwest.
07:35
Do you think they are less resilient or resilient in different
07:39
ways due to their modification?
07:41
I think they're often simplified.
07:43
I
07:46
study food webs quite a bit.
07:48
In terms of food webs, I think the diversity is much lower.
07:53
They can be very resilient because they're young trees and they're able to recover
08:01
quickly, but they're also more prone to some kinds of disturbances, such as fire.
08:06
Young stands burn more quickly and more often hotter than an old growth forest.
08:15
There are some real differences and mostly it's just that it
08:18
really is kind of like farming.
08:20
I've gotten my head around that when I am working in these systems
08:24
that, oh, yeah, we're farming trees here and the crop is a 40-year crop.
08:30
It's the agricultural model.
08:32
Yeah.
08:33
What about chaos versus orderly?
08:36
Would you say that that's site-specific as well?
08:40
I don't usually think of those terms.
08:42
Okay.
08:48
Not part of your repertoire of thinking.
08:50
No.
08:52
I think it's too viewer specific.
08:56
Sure.
08:59
Fair.
09:00
What is your theoretical-philosophical background and how is that
09:04
applied toward your science?
09:08
That's a good question.
09:09
I don't often muse about my philosophical background, but I do have one.
09:17
It comes from the idea of
09:22
respect for the systems and for the native systems and trying to
09:29
understand how natural ecosystems function so that we can, as we modify
09:37
ecosystems and landscapes, we can have them as functional as we can.
09:46
I realize that places, not everywhere is going to be natural,
09:49
but we do need certain kinds of processes to sustain healthy
09:59
communities.
10:00
It's kind of circular to say ecosystems sustain ecosystems, but it really is
10:06
hard to get away from that language.
10:08
Sure.
10:10
The level of life-type ideas and in my science, I am much more of an
10:21
experimentalist and an observationalist than a theoretical [person] -I probably
10:27
tend more to the applied rather than the basic, and it may be that I came
10:32
into science a little bit later that I find people who really think in theory
10:38
are raised in science from very young.
10:43
I had some other things I did before I became a scientist, and so I'm a little
10:49
more practical, maybe, in how I approach it, or just more applied or interested
10:56
in seeing how things play out and how things can be adapted to improve our
11:05
forest management, our stream management.
11:11
As someone who comes from a hydrology and biochemistry
11:15
background, has that influenced your approach to science as well?
11:20
Yeah, I've always focused on the water and I focus on understanding water,
11:29
understanding the variability has always been what draws me.
11:33
I'm not a bird person.
11:34
I'm not a tree person.
11:36
I'm a water person and I straddle the line of bio and eco, or hydro and eco for water
11:49
and enjoy both sides of
11:53
it.
11:53
Do you think as a hydro-eco person that you have a different perspective
11:58
on these systems than other people?
12:00
How does your perspective compare say to a bird person or a tree person?
12:06
Well, some of us sometimes talk about our different perspectives of landscapes and
12:12
of processes and it seems like when you're working in a stream many people who work
12:20
in streams have to understand a little bit more about the upland processes:
12:27
soils and water movement through soils and water movement through trees, not
12:32
in an extensive way, but at least to understand some of these because it
12:37
influences what we study in the streams.
12:40
I sometimes find people who work in areas that are higher in the catchment don't
12:47
necessarily have to think about what surrounds them as much or that kind of
12:52
spatial linkage like I do in a stream.
12:56
Somebody who's working on a bug in the top of a tree probably has very
13:01
little idea what's going on in the stream or what's making it to the
13:04
stream or those kinds of questions aren't part of their key, core ideas.
13:12
But in a stream, I'm thinking of the bugs that are falling out
13:15
of the trees and detritus and
13:19
algae that's growing in [the stream] and nutrients that are coming in.
13:24
I think we have a different connectivity to our watersheds
13:30
and all the processes in those
13:34
watersheds by being at the bottom of the watershed.
13:38
Would you say that it almost forces an integrative mindset?
13:42
I think it is more than
13:46
I expected when I got into it.
13:48
I think I've learned a lot more about all these other systems to
13:53
better help me understand my system.
13:57
In the field of ecology and the Andrews Forest history in general,
14:00
would you say that that's sort of a more recent development?
14:03
I know that that's a big part of the Andrews Forest is the
14:05
forest-stream interactions?
14:06
Yeah.
14:08
That was mostly very recent, right?
14:10
In the field of ecology in general?
14:12
Or would you say that those ideas stem from further back?
14:18
For history of ecology, aquatic sides are much shorter.
14:25
Going back to, you know, early study of lakes was where people mostly focused
14:30
and then to move into streams has really only been since '50s and maybe the '60s.
14:39
The Andrews was very prominent in those early stream studies, had a very rich
14:45
cadre of researchers and ideas and energy.
14:50
I've been really, I was really drawn to that and knew of the Andrews as a graduate
14:56
student when I was working elsewhere.
15:00
In terms of recent, I guess it depends on how old you are whether you think of
15:04
like some of the riparian work in the late '70s and early '80s as recent or old.
15:13
It's a generation back at least, one generation at least
15:17
of scientists, maybe two.
15:22
Sometimes some of those ideas get lost.
15:25
It's
15:27
hard when new scientists come in for them to understand the history of the place,
15:34
to want to go back and read the papers from the '70s or early
15:38
'80s about what was happening.
15:41
People have a tendency to
15:46
redevelop, redesign, re-I'm trying to think of the word: rediscover things
15:53
that are actually in the literature.
15:55
Okay
15:58
[laughs]
15:58
. That's across all science.
16:00
Yeah, okay.
16:02
That's just from a lack of going back and having a historical
16:05
perspective, I suppose, on what it is that you're studying.
16:08
Yeah.
16:09
That's interesting.
16:10
Would you say that that's happening with stream-forest interaction
16:13
research specifically, too?
16:15
Yeah.
16:15
I think it happens across all of them.
16:17
It's kind of tied back to those ideas cycling.
16:20
But I think it also, because the Andrews does have such a
16:23
strong history from the IBP
16:28
days and River Continuum days and early LTER that some of those ideas,
16:36
so much was looked at then that
16:42
it can almost be discouraging, that: did they figure out everything already?
16:46
That's not the case, so.
16:48
Right.
16:50
I mean, with different perspectives or theories or philosophies, I guess you
16:54
could take on a different approach.
16:55
If we could focus for a minute longer on the stream-ecology interface, because
17:00
I think that's very interesting, is I know that initially ecosystem ecology
17:06
had somewhat of a static and bounded perception of ecosystems, right?
17:12
But then you have dynamic ecology that's emerging and sort of understanding
17:16
and your background with disturbances.
17:18
How would you say that the stream-ecology interface, the perspective, and
17:22
our understanding of that has changed philosophically over time
17:25
over the course of your career?
17:30
I think people were slower to work in streams than lakes because of
17:37
the dynamic nature of streams with flooding and runoff, whereas
17:41
lakes can be much more stable and can be easier to study.
17:45
They're more of a closed system.
17:48
The forest-stream interactions have been really, it's really a strong
17:54
part of the Andrews history, as much or more than some of the other
17:59
sites, because of that early work.
18:02
Seeing it move forward, is that what you asked?
18:06
How is it currently?
18:08
How is our perspective on stream-ecology interactions changing through time?
18:12
Yeah.
18:17
Broadly, at the Andrews it really depends on who you think about.
18:27
Some of us think much more about streams and landscapes
18:31
because of the connectivity.
18:33
Other people working at the Andrews are thinking much more about species
18:36
interactions, so kind of going more towards that population side of processes.
18:43
Some are thinking about food webs.
18:46
Some are thinking about disturbance in food webs.
18:50
It's really hard to work in a stream and not think about disturbances.
18:53
There were some early papers in the late '80s that ask whether flooding is a
19:01
disturbance in a stream, because if it's regular-the whole question of disturbance.
19:07
Those were some very influential papers in my background of what is a disturbance
19:15
and how do we define disturbances?
19:17
Or is it just more variability in conditions.
19:22
And
19:25
landscapes and patches were also big topics that we haven't maybe fully
19:31
developed at the Andrews as we might
19:36
have.
19:37
Even just the aquatic community at the Andrews, it really depends on who's
19:43
present at the table when you're talking.
19:46
There's no unified perspective.
19:48
There's no Andrews perspective.
19:50
There's lots of perspectives.
19:54
Maybe the thing we try and encourage the most to be kind of an Andrews
19:58
perspective is a function of our long-term research and trying to
20:06
help researchers be aware of the history of the site so that they can be
20:12
informed as they ask their questions.
20:17
With long-term research, that's what we're really supposed to be doing
20:20
is building on our long-term data.
20:25
In a sense, would you say that the stream-ecology interaction almost
20:30
opened up a little bit of our thinking about the dynamics of systems?
20:36
I think stream ecology has really pushed that into
20:43
some of the landscape ecology that came up a little bit later, but included
20:49
streams, but not quite as much.
20:51
Included streams, but then started focusing on those disturbances.
20:55
It's hard to focus on disturbances.
21:00
It's messy and you kind of need to be able to view them from afar
21:06
to be able to characterize them.
21:12
As remote sensing has come along, as different ways of seeing our
21:17
ecosystems it really makes a difference, and also different ways
21:20
of measuring things in our ecosystems.
21:22
As we've gone to more and more sensors and cheap sensors and precise sensors, we can
21:31
increase the scale of which we're working.
21:37
A lot of the early work was very patch, very reach-scale [focused] , because
21:42
that's all we could really handle.
21:45
To do it at bigger and bigger scales and to think about the connectivity,
21:49
the River Continuum work that was in part at the Andrews was really key in
21:55
that paradigm of everything's connected.
22:00
Along with
22:03
this stream-ecology interaction, I know that Andrews Forest, and
22:05
your work in particular, does emphasize and focus on disturbance.
22:09
How do you think that science, or the philosophy and practice of it,
22:13
has changed in response to trying to understand disturbances more?
22:16
You talk about the sensors in increasing our ability technologically.
22:22
But is there any other way these methods or theories that we've
22:26
developed over time to be able to understand disturbances better?
22:30
I
22:32
think early on, when I was a seasonal Forest Service person back in the '70s,
22:39
people had a very static view of forests and fairly static view of streams.
22:46
This is how they're supposed to look.
22:48
This is what they do.
22:50
Old trees were big and decadent.
22:52
The dynamic nature of streams, of forests, is coming into play more,
23:02
even though in the '60s there were some papers about stream meandering
23:05
and that kind of disturbance.
23:09
We went through a really strong engineering phase where everything was
23:13
riprapped in streams and channelized.
23:17
Forests were supposed to be all one age and you throw out the old trees
23:22
and you make them young and bigger.
23:24
I think disturbance has really helped us recognize, and then play with,
23:28
diversity, changes in diversity, and whether it be diversity of
23:32
species or diversity of habitats.
23:36
There's an intermediate disturbance hypothesis that I
23:41
learned about in grad school.
23:44
I harken
23:46
back to that quite a bit as its influence on diversity of the site
23:51
and the cyclic nature of what we see.
23:58
Where are we on this gradient?
24:00
I always had trouble with, for example, island biogeographic
24:04
theory, the bio, because it assumed things were very static, very fixed.
24:13
Was trying to make you kind of come back to laws, and it was trying to
24:16
make laws based on a static view and didn't have much space for diversity
24:24
and disturbance and some things-so it was always kind of hard for me to
24:33
get that,
24:37
or to want to generalize things down to a single member for an area or
24:41
something, because I see the variety more.
24:45
That has far [-reaching] implications, too, in terms of management in
24:49
the environmental movement and challenges with the old growth, right?
24:53
Right.
24:53
In terms of seeing them as static or are they always in constant change.
24:56
Right.
25:00
You mentioned a little bit earlier about that you're combined experimental
25:05
and observational approaches.
25:06
Do you mind elaborating on that?
25:08
Sure.
25:16
My questions tend to come in the view of seeing something and wondering
25:22
why, not thinking about some theoretical question and looking for
25:26
a place that it might be happening.
25:29
I see something and I'm curious about it and then I think about how to test it,
25:35
which often falls to experiments because
25:42
I'm a hands-on person.
25:43
I've done construction and things, and so, oh, let's implement this.
25:49
I've been part of some big experiments over the years where we added 15N, an
25:55
isotope of nitrogen, 15N, ammonia and nitrate and watched how it went through
26:01
stream and food webs, watched how it went through biology and chemical processes.
26:08
Those kinds of experiments.
26:09
I've tried to do some experiments with temperature and shading, even
26:17
our watershed experiments, our watershed studies at the Andrews,
26:21
our small watersheds that are gauged are really a relic of experiments
26:26
that began in the '50s and '60s.
26:28
A couple of them began in the '80s, where they harvested
26:32
something and left [unharvested] something else as a reference.
26:35
Those kinds of observational
26:41
[approaches] . At what point does an experimental just become
26:44
observational with our small watersheds now that we're 60 years
26:50
out from when the treatment was done?
26:53
It's still an experiment, but we're observing.
26:58
I like that level of
27:03
exploration in a stream.
27:08
That's interesting, too, because I think that historically a lot of
27:11
people have talked about observational versus experimental as if they're
27:14
separate, but in actuality they might actually be fluid, right?
27:19
Yeah.
27:19
I mean you can't observe things without getting involved.
27:27
It's usually we impact what we're observing, so you almost have
27:30
to consider it an experiment.
27:33
There's almost like whether you like it or not, as scientists, there's
27:37
an engagement process and you're in the thing that you're studying.
27:41
Sometimes it's not even intentional.
27:43
We don't realize that we're impacting what we're observing.
27:50
I worked in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Hugo.
27:53
I was a grad student and we were working pretty regularly down there
27:57
and the research footprint idea became really obvious, because all
28:02
these people were down there studying this hurricane, the impacts of the
28:06
hurricane and some recovery, but we had to be really careful that we
28:10
weren't studying each other's impacts.
28:16
It's the same way in a stream.
28:17
If I go out and sample something and I'm observing what insects are in the stream,
28:22
I may be disturbing something and so you have to be careful our sequence of things.
28:29
We're worried about that a little bit right now at the Andrews with Watershed
28:34
1, one of the watersheds that burned.
28:38
There's probably going to be a pulse of people wanting to get back in and revisit
28:44
prior instruments, which is perfect.
28:47
But we have to be pretty careful about sequencing that so that somebody whose
28:52
working in the soils isn't impacting what the vegetation people are seeing,
28:57
and that we're not in the stream, we're not seeing a signal of sediment because
29:03
people are disturbing the hillslopes.
29:09
I think it is harder to separate them, even if you're out studying
29:12
birds, at some point you're going to affect the birds by being there.
29:17
Their behavior.
29:18
Yeah.
29:24
Good to be aware of that.
29:28
You touched on this a little bit with the last question, but to ask a little bit
29:31
more explicitly: what is your strategy in developing a research question?
29:43
I don't know that I have a strategy.
29:45
I'm probably a little more opportunistic.
29:51
I see things.
29:52
I get curious about them and kind of dive into that area.
29:59
Sometimes that is influenced by circumstance of just happening
30:03
to be there and seeing something.
30:06
Sometimes it's because of a planned direction of
30:14
so-and-so has a question, some managers have a question, some
30:22
landowners have questions.
30:24
What about this?
30:25
That can be a stimulus.
30:27
Then
30:29
it's always that juggle with trying to find funding for projects, too.
30:36
Some science is expensive and you need to figure out how to fund the research
30:44
because we can't study everything.
30:46
We don't have enough money, so how do we prioritize?
30:50
As we prioritize, I realize some things I'm not interested in and others do that.
30:57
Other things I'm more interested in and I'm willing to pursue those questions
31:04
and those opportunities.
31:08
My strategy is probably just perseverance, curiosity and perseverance.
31:15
Curiosity gets you going and then perseverance to find the
31:18
funding and make it happen.
31:22
Would you say the question more so comes to you, it seems like what
31:25
you're describing, rather than it being a theoretical predetermined
31:28
thing that you go to find?
31:31
I think it's probably some interactions of observing the landscape and observing
31:35
a system and that curiosity of seeing something and then thinking on it
31:43
and that iteration back and forth.
31:49
It's not like somebody hands me a question and I'm willing to go work on it.
31:55
What are your thoughts in regards to objectivity in scientific research?
32:02
Yeah, it's something we have to be as explicit about as possible.
32:08
It's hard.
32:10
Everybody has a perspective and at what point is our perspective based
32:14
on just our observations or on our interpretation of our observations?
32:19
It's a big one, especially when I'm working on more policy-related issues and
32:31
at what point are my, how do I keep my personal feelings about how a stream is
32:40
being restored or a landscape is being managed away from the science questions?
32:48
I think, as long as we're conscious about it, it'll help us not just slip
32:54
into working to our preconceptions.
32:59
The preconceptions can also just be about theory and keeping an open
33:06
mind about "theory says this, but is that really what I'm seeing?"
33:14
is important.
33:17
Objectivity is crucial.
33:19
It's nebulous but we need to keep testing ourselves on
33:30
it.
33:30
That's my perspective on it.
33:33
To clarify your perspective, would you say being conscientious of one's
33:37
preconceived notions could actually help in terms of achieving better objectivity?
33:42
Yeah.
33:45
Preconceived notions about any aspect of it: applied, basic, policy, theory.
33:58
Next question-as a researcher, how do you use the scientific method to find truth?
34:05
I don't know that I find truth.
34:09
I
34:12
get to results.
34:13
I get to observations and analyses.
34:20
I think, as part of the scientific method, as we talked about, the background
34:26
is really important, foundational.
34:28
Information about reading, even foundational studies that may disagree
34:34
so that you realize there's a range out there and putting together the
34:40
best studies you can to address those hypotheses and questions.
34:47
Then moving on and thinking about analyses and not going into analyses
34:54
with a preconceived idea of what's going to come out and trying various
35:02
things to, different ways of looking at the data: analytically, graphically,
35:07
and then helping put those findings back into a more holistic perspective.
35:14
As I've gotten older and gotten more gray hair and things,
35:19
everything is much more gray.
35:22
When I first, years ago I did a project for Weyerhaeuser.
35:26
It was like Weyerhaeuser and it was black and white and I was an environmental
35:31
person, not even an ecologist yet, but over the years I realize, oh,
35:39
there are many more perspectives here, shades of gray, gradients.
35:47
Diversity of truths.
35:48
Yeah.
35:50
Well, and truth.
35:52
I'm not sure I like the term truth because that assumes there's
35:56
just one way and thus truth.
36:00
Can there be truth if there are different ways that an organism
36:07
is doing something - are all true?
36:09
We tend to think it's only one.
36:14
Where does truth fit into some of these processes and conflicting results?
36:23
I don't have an answer, but
36:26
some of my science, for example, is seeing something that generally is in
36:32
the literature as truth that, if you open up the canopies and you get more
36:38
nutrients, there'll be more algae.
36:40
It's a very basic thing.
36:43
Yet we studied it in the Coast Range in a very experimental way, and we
36:49
didn't get the response of the algae.
36:56
You know there's two truths: one is there's more response and one
37:00
is there wasn't much response.
37:02
I don't know.
37:04
That's why I have trouble with the word truth, but I think there are results.
37:08
I think there's probably, if I was smart enough, I could figure
37:11
out when there's going to be a response and when there's not.
37:16
I'm not sure I'm there yet.
37:18
Everything I'm looking at doesn't quite, isn't clean-cut and so the messiness, I
37:25
think, is hard to fit into a truth aspect.
37:30
I suppose maybe then the idea of truth almost like assumes
37:35
that nature's universal and homogenous across time and space.
37:39
Yeah.
37:40
It assumes that about nature, which is, that itself may not be true.
37:44
Yeah, or that's not what I see.
37:48
I don't see homogenous.
37:49
I see diverse.
37:50
I see heterogenous.
37:54
I see exceptions to the rules often.
38:01
In relation to this last question, are there laws of nature?
38:05
If so, can you define what a law of nature means?
38:09
I saw that on your sheet.
38:10
I thought the laws of nature?
38:13
There are.
38:17
Organisms need fuel to grow, is probably a law of nature.
38:21
Gravity is a law.
38:24
As an ecologist, I'm not really working in those realms very much.
38:30
My partner is a mathematician with some physics background and I think he deals
38:36
with laws and I deal with processes.
38:40
He kind of will say, "Don't you know x, y, and z about your system?" It's like, no.
38:46
We don't.
38:47
Well, [imitates puzzled look] . I deal with uncertainties much more than laws.
38:53
That's an interesting that you and your partner's work, the contrast of
38:57
that I think is very characteristic of ecology and physics, or math, as
39:03
whole disciplines.
39:04
Uncertainties and events versus more universals.
39:08
Right.
39:11
Physics, I think the repeatability of their events is
39:19
they have the probabilities down.
39:22
We don't.
39:25
Repeatability.
39:26
Are there any other things would you say that you can see the
39:28
difference that really highlights the contrast between the two?
39:36
I think certainty and repeatability.
39:39
When he talks about stuff, it's, "This happens and then this happens and there's
39:43
this energy level given off or this formula goes through and you ... ." And,
39:51
so, I think even over time he sees some of the uncertainties or different starting
39:56
points can get to different answers, which I think helps explain our ecology that
40:02
we have many different starting points.
40:04
I
40:09
don't think in those terms very often.
40:11
Right.
40:14
It's a different framework.
40:15
Yeah.
40:16
What about cause and effect?
40:19
Well, yeah, I mean, so much of what we look at is if this happens then
40:26
this happens and then what happens?
40:32
When a fire burns, fire people assume one thing and we're learning
40:36
about the diversity of fire responses, or hydrologic responses.
40:45
But it's not a fixed answer for most of what I study.
40:53
You've touched on this a little bit, but what are your overall
40:57
motivations for curiosity or for finding real-world solutions.
41:01
You've said that you are situated a little bit more on the applied side of things?
41:06
I
41:09
came into science because I like water.
41:15
I like understanding.
41:17
There's a curiosity that got me into it, but there's also that I wanted to
41:22
be able to make an impact in some way or work towards the betterment of systems.
41:36
I thought about going into engineering.
41:38
I didn't.
41:42
It's way on the applied side, right?
41:44
Yeah, and the types of questions they work on I thought it
41:51
would get old pretty quick,
41:55
most engineers.
41:58
I did groundwater work for a while and cleaning up oil
42:02
spills around gas stations.
42:05
I didn't want to spend my time doing that.
42:10
There's more of a learning and discovering element to where you are now, right?
42:15
Yeah, and I like nature.
42:17
I'm happy outside.
42:22
Working in an urban situation isn't as attractive to me as working
42:28
in-I think urban, I think urban without a whole lot of vegetation.
42:36
There are nice urban gardens and parks and things that are pleasant.
42:40
But the natural world is much more attractive to me for spending
42:46
time, even though I spend a lot of time in front of a computer now.
42:51
That concludes our first section.
42:56
Would you like to take a 5-minute break?
42:58
I would.
42:59
Okay, sounds good.
43:01
I can pause the recording and then we can meet back here in five minutes.
43:04
Okay, sounds good.
43:05
We've come to 45 minutes with the last section.
43:06
Sounds good.
43:07
Okay.
43:21
These next set of questions are in regards to philosophy and practice on a
43:25
community level at the Andrews Forest.
43:27
I'll inquire about different traditions and approaches to science on a
43:30
community level and what role these different approaches contribute to the
43:33
Andrews science community as a whole.
43:35
My first question is what role does natural history play in
43:41
the Andrews Experimental Forest?
43:44
I think it's a huge role because of the-it's just such
43:52
a dramatic place to work.
43:58
That feedback between it being a dramatic place to work and having good science
44:02
and there's lots of pretty places in the world, but that combination has
44:09
been really strong at the Andrews.
44:14
Can you elaborate what you mean by dramatic?
44:20
Steep forest landscapes, big trees, big rocks,
44:27
interesting understory, interesting communities.
44:32
The aquatic fish community is pretty simple, but the bugs are very diverse.
44:41
Panoramic, I guess, I mean by dramatic.
44:45
I did my dissertation in Oklahoma on some streams there that were really interesting
44:52
but they weren't panoramic by any means.
44:59
I
45:02
know that in the field of ecology as a whole some people have expressed that
45:07
natural history has been pushed to the backburner while more hypothesis-driven
45:12
research has taken greater popularity.
45:16
Would you say that that's true for the Andrews Forest?
45:18
Or does natural history still play as much of an important role?
45:25
You know, the hypothesis-driven aspects, I find it really, as
45:32
I mentioned, person-specific.
45:35
It's hard to-I was trying to think of ways to describe the diversity of
45:39
opinions or the variety of opinions.
45:45
I don't know if it's a gradient of hypothesis to observational, because
45:49
we are all are working together.
45:51
But some people's brains just go to hypothesis.
45:55
Mine goes
45:59
to questions that aren't quite as formal as hypotheses.
46:05
When I think about the Andrews, I go back to a statement Mark
46:09
Harmon, or one of the reviews we got on our LTER5 proposal, maybe?
46:15
[LTER5 is the fifth increment of LTER grant funding] I think LTER5.
46:17
Mark Harmon was the lead.
46:20
One of the reviewers came back and said, "You're not phrasing your questions as
46:29
hypotheses." Mark Harmon, kind of had a-have you met Mark?
46:33
I've spoken to him via email, but not in person.
46:36
Okay.
46:36
He's kind of a big, gruff teddy bear.
46:39
He ranted and ranted about hypothesis questions and how can you really do
46:46
long-term questions with hypotheses
46:49
and so he saw a real temporal dynamic in hypothesis-driven, and that
46:57
it's kind of, what was the wording-superfluous?
47:02
to just say we have this hypothesis because we may never get to the answer.
47:07
We'll get to small answers, but if it's a big enough hypothesis for the long-term
47:11
it's going to be almost unanswerable.
47:13
You almost have to break it into smaller bits and bites.
47:18
Hypothesis-driven happens at the Andrews
47:25
and lots of other research happens, too.
47:32
Do you think that NSF plays a role?
47:35
Are they for one approach over another?
47:39
Oh yeah.
47:39
I think NSF proposals, especially non-LTER ones, are very hypothesis-formulated.
47:48
People
47:50
who are doing well in that or in thinking in those lines phrase things
47:56
as hypotheses more for that purpose.
48:03
You write to who, you write in a language that your funder is used to.
48:12
LTER proposals have, I
48:16
think we juggled one of the more recent LTER proposals about using
48:21
hypothesis terminology or not, and are they really hypotheses?
48:26
Maybe some of our short-term experiments or observations are going to be
48:31
hypothesis-framed, but our bigger, longer-term questions are more questions.
48:41
In terms of experiments, I think having hypotheses for experiments helps
48:49
structure the design better because it makes it very clear and explicit.
48:54
To go out and do an experiment if you don't have a strong "what
48:59
if?" or expectations that are often framed as hypotheses you
49:05
may not measure the right things.
49:07
I see a real strong connection between hypotheses and experiments.
49:14
Just help to contain, help define the experiment more.
49:17
Right.
49:18
Help structure it in a way that can also be repeatable as well.
49:22
Right.
49:26
Would you say that it's a combination that characterize the Andrews Forest, that
49:31
have contributed to the Andrews Forest?
49:34
Yeah.
49:34
We really talk about the long-term
49:39
studies and observations and then the short-term and experiments that go on.
49:46
Short-term studies aren't always experiments.
49:50
Some can be observational.
49:55
They all interweave with one another to create this
49:58
long-term story, though, right?
50:01
Right.
50:01
Ideally, yes.
50:02
Yes.
50:03
That's the goal.
50:05
Yeah.
50:07
Short-term is combination, it can be experimental, observational, but would you
50:11
say long-term is primarily observational?
50:14
Well, we have the long-term watershed experiments that
50:17
are 60 years, 70 years now.
50:20
We have log decomp.
50:22
Those are probably two of the main experiments that we're still studying.
50:29
You can think about some of the prior harvests that aren't part of
50:33
small watersheds as experiments, but we're not-we're studying them.
50:38
There's new gaps getting created.
50:40
I
50:42
think it's a mix.
50:43
It's a mixed bag, yeah.
50:47
What role does ecosystem modeling have in the Andrews Experimental Forest?
50:53
Yeah, we've-partly because of who's present and who's at the table and
51:01
who is currently working there,
51:05
we've had some history of very strong ecosystem modeling with some of our early
51:11
researchers: Dick Waring and his students.
51:17
We've done some modeling around stream nitrogen dynamics as part of that big
51:24
cross-site study, Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment, what I called LINX, and
51:32
we had lots of people doing hydrologic modeling using our long-term data.
51:38
We are probably a little short of ecosystem modeling
51:42
at this point with our current
51:47
group and who's currently being funded and what their skills are.
51:54
It comes and goes in importance in NSF and LTER.
52:02
We often end up sharing ecosystem modelers across LTER sites because once somebody
52:10
has a good model-for example there was a graduate student who was working at
52:13
Hubbard Brook and Niwot Ridge and started using some of our Andrews data using the
52:20
same model in different circumstances.
52:25
Helping him refine his model for the Andrews was a recent thing.
52:32
But he wasn't really, it didn't come out of our group as much.
52:37
It came out of some other efforts.
52:44
Through your time working at Andrews Forest what would you say
52:47
are some advantages and limitations to modeling, or challenges
52:53
or contributions?
53:00
I think it really can help us ask questions.
53:03
Even if the questions aren't totally accurate, it helps
53:08
us understand the processes.
53:10
For example, this recent Ph.D. student's paper about climate change and old
53:17
growth and by putting everything he could into his model, it came
53:22
out with some surprising findings.
53:25
Some of it makes me think about how well we're parametrizing our system
53:32
and how well you can model that kind of dynamic.
53:38
There's strengths and weaknesses on both sides.
53:42
Ecosystem modeling may be more the numeric side of it and tying it back
53:49
to the field-based isn't always-the people who go into ecosystem modeling
53:55
aren't often the field people.
53:59
We just really haven't pulled as many in as we might have, partly maybe they're
54:08
not focusing on the Andrews as much.
54:11
It's a complex system.
54:13
It's easier to model other places.
54:15
But
54:17
I think it's valuable.
54:19
Any kind of hypothesis modeling, hypothesis generation,
54:26
it's a different way to run experiments is almost how I think of it.
54:32
We do have some aquatic-one scientist is doing some aquatic modeling for fish.
54:39
That's much more kind of an individual-when we say ecosystem
54:43
modeling, there's all different kinds of modeling, just like there's all different
54:47
levels of organization of ecology.
54:52
That's on a different scale, essentially.
54:56
I would think some of the modeling that's happening more commonly is
55:01
maybe more on the population level.
55:04
At the Andrews Forest?
55:05
Yeah.
55:08
And maybe some communities, but not quite as much ecosystem.
55:13
Gotcha.
55:16
Would you say that at the Andrews Forest it's more bottom-top research?
55:23
Yeah.
55:26
I think we're a very dispersed group compared to some of the other LTERs
55:31
that are much more hierarchical and more narrowly focused.
55:36
I
55:40
think it's partly a function of our structure and our trying to be inclusive
55:45
tends to make us more dispersed.
55:50
There's probably some strength to that as well as weakness.
55:53
Yeah.
55:55
There's trade-offs either way.
55:57
Right.
55:57
That also would explain the interdisciplinary character
56:01
of the research as well.
56:03
Right.
56:04
To be interdisciplinary, my major advisor used to say, you need to be
56:09
really strong in something and if you're totally interdisciplinary you're going
56:12
to be a mile wide and an inch deep.
56:16
That's
56:20
always that push-pull of interdisciplinary versus much more focused.
56:28
With the Andrews Forest's very strong interdisciplinary nature how do
56:32
you think that's characterized the philosophy of science or the way that
56:35
people think about forest ecosystems?
56:41
I think it's helped integrate by getting the people coming from different
56:47
backgrounds thinking about the same thing.
56:50
I think some of maybe our more current research in the last couple of years
56:56
is much more, is maybe less integrated, much more individual project based.
57:06
As the pendulum swings back and forth between integration versus just
57:11
individual we're probably more on the side of separate projects these days
57:20
as opposed to integrated-it's hard to integrate with a great, big group.
57:24
Our group is pretty big right now.
57:30
I think it's easier to integrate, you know, there's probably some
57:33
optimal sizes of integration
57:38
and disciplines.
57:45
That's about it.
57:47
I didn't know.
57:48
We work to integrate more and to have projects and people
57:54
learning about each other.
57:55
We don't have quite as many mechanisms of it as we used to.
57:58
Do
58:02
you think disciplinary traditions play a role when people are specialized?
58:08
Yeah.
58:13
We talked about natural history, observational modeling and
58:18
hypothesis-driven experimental.
58:20
Are there other approaches to ecological research that you think
58:23
aren't covered by these terms or that fall in-between the lines?
58:30
There probably are but I can't think of any.
58:43
I have a couple of concluding questions.
58:46
Okay.
58:47
To wrap up here.
58:50
The next one would be what significant ideas have emerged from the Andrews
58:54
science community and how do the science of these ideas evolve in terms
58:58
of questions and methods over time?
59:03
Have you seen a book that we put together
59:11
10 years ago, Transformational
59:14
Ideas?
59:17
Hmm-mm, no.
59:17
Because we were being asked this question by NSF.
59:20
Okay.
59:21
So, what are you known for?
59:23
It made us think.
59:24
It's a little bit dated.
59:26
It's not been brought up to speed more and in that, and I'll try and
59:32
dig it out and send it to you because we did a nice job of summarizing
59:36
across several different disciplines.
59:40
That'd be great.
59:42
The role of wood-significant ideas are forest-stream
59:46
interactions and all that means.
59:51
Another one is the role of wood, deadwood in the detritus and
59:58
detritus of the magnitude we see, whether it be standing or dead.
1:00:03
Because people usually think of detritus as leaves and here, we think of them as
1:00:07
big logs-how that structures an ecosystem, both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
1:00:17
Significant ideas,
1:00:21
we were part of some major significant ideas that I don't think we can take
1:00:27
credit for, but that we were part of, whether it be some of the International
1:00:32
Biological Program budgeting, ecosystem budgeting that we were in on.
1:00:37
We were part of the coniferous site but there were other sites around the country
1:00:43
and something that came out of those early interactions of working across sites was
1:00:49
the River Continuum Concept and thinking of streams as more than just a study
1:00:55
reach and thinking about streams through landscapes and predictable patterns.
1:01:00
I
1:01:03
think some of our work on
1:01:10
biogeochemistry has been influential because we're kind of a unique,
1:01:15
low-nitrogen system that many researchers have studied and modeled and thought
1:01:23
about the role of disturbances and thought about why and what.
1:01:27
Biogeochemistry
1:01:33
specifically how an ecosystem functions with such low nitrogen has been a
1:01:40
question and it's an idea that's emerged.
1:01:44
I've had quite a lot of hydrologic research and some of the other sites.
1:01:51
We're part of an LTER network, but we're also part of a [US Forest
1:01:53
Service] Experimental Forest network.
1:01:55
Are you familiar with the experimental forests?
1:01:58
Yeah.
1:01:59
A bunch of them have long-term hydrologic experiments like we do.
1:02:06
There's been
1:02:08
some sharing of ideas, because I tend not to be a person that says oh, we're the
1:02:13
best and it's all of us, it's all of us.
1:02:17
I think it's good to be humble and note that ideas are
1:02:21
often formed through sharing.
1:02:22
The idea of the influence of forest management on hydrology has been a big
1:02:30
area of study and we've really contributed to that science and to the modeling
1:02:36
of what happens when you harvest trees and you get these pulses of water and
1:02:42
when is that water coming off and then over successional time you can get a
1:02:48
decrease and when is that important?
1:02:51
What season of the years and seasonality questions, so that aspect of
1:02:56
forest-stream interactions or making water available, water quality and quantity.
1:03:03
More recently I think people have been really focused on microclimate and
1:03:08
diversity of microhabitats, which we're calling microclimate but microhabitat
1:03:16
is another way to think about it.
1:03:21
How they've evolved I think I would go back to that they evolved
1:03:31
in discussion, in collaboration, in
1:03:37
exploration, not only at our site but other sites.
1:03:45
There's a cross-pollination of ideas within the site and within
1:03:49
the greater communities and networks of the sites engaged with it.
1:03:53
I think it's cross-pollination within and across.
1:04:01
Scientists tend to forget how much we cross-pollinate.
1:04:04
They tend to think of ideas as just their own or that they've discovered something.
1:04:09
But I see a lot of commonality across ideas.
1:04:18
Great.
1:04:19
Okay, so my concluding question is what do you see is the principles and motivating
1:04:24
forces that drive the Andrews as a
1:04:29
community?
1:04:29
I think we've probably first have to define what is a community?
1:04:38
Right.
1:04:38
Are we thinking LTER community?
1:04:40
Are we thinking of people who work at the Andrews?
1:04:42
Are we thinking of people who work there presently or over time?
1:04:52
I know what we try to think about as a motivating force.
1:04:56
It'd be interesting to see what other researchers who maybe aren't quite
1:05:02
as involved as I am at the Andrews would say, but trying to have a
1:05:08
motivating force of honest collaborative
1:05:15
research that is trying to-open sharing of ideas, which is collaborative,
1:05:28
but we don't always get there.
1:05:32
The idea that it's important to respect, as a principle, to do the
1:05:40
best science we can independent from our own biases would ideally be a
1:05:49
principle of what we're trying to do.
1:05:55
Motivating force?
1:05:58
I think the Andrews does have some prestige in its various communities and so
1:06:05
for some folks that is a motivating force.
1:06:08
I've heard it from some of our younger scientists that they want to be associated
1:06:13
with the Andrews because of that prestige, but then what does that mean?
1:06:18
How do we honor the legacy of the previous researchers who worked so
1:06:25
hard to have the Andrews be a center of
1:06:35
very solid research, solid, useful research that isn't working to address
1:06:43
community questions, working with managers, working on theoretical
1:06:49
questions as well as issues involved in forest management, because that really
1:06:55
harkens back to our roots of being set up to answer specific forest management
1:07:02
questions, but being open to new ideas.
1:07:14
I used to see the Andrews as a very solid community and then being in that
1:07:22
community now for 20-some years I see it dispersed, a dispersed community also,
1:07:31
which is fun to see people at meetings who have a history at the Andrews that
1:07:35
I may have not had, overlapped with them even, but yet we have a shared history.
1:07:40
There's that kind of a community.
1:07:42
There's the social community of it that is also strong, at least it's especially
1:07:50
strong because some of the stream people and the personalities involved.
1:07:55
They've really worked to have it be a community, an aquatic community
1:08:03
with fairly porous boundaries.
1:08:11
Wonderful.
1:08:12
Awesome.
1:08:15
Are there any final, concluding statements that you would like to
1:08:20
make before we end the interview
1:08:25
today?
1:08:27
I appreciate your effort to dive into this and look at some of these
1:08:31
and ask these probing questions.
1:08:33
I think it's fun that you're doing that and I look forward to
1:08:37
seeing what you synthesize out of all these disparate ideas.
1:08:44
Can I ask who else you're talking to?
1:08:46
Yes.
1:08:46
I talked to Richard Waring, Fred Swanson, and I'm going to
1:08:51
be talking to Mark Harmon and Julia Jones.
1:08:55
That's who I have set up for now.
1:08:56
Okay.
1:08:57
Anyone else?
1:08:58
That's it for now.
1:09:00
We're kind of the old guard.
1:09:02
You don't have many young voices in there.
1:09:04
Mm-mm, no.
1:09:05
Not at the moment.
1:09:06
Okay.
1:09:08
As long as you recognize that.
1:09:11
As long as that's one of your founding conditions, this is who I talked to,
1:09:16
because some of the younger folks might say oh that's not how I think or
1:09:22
oh yeah that's how I think.
1:09:23
Yeah.
1:09:24
The inter-generational perspectives.
1:09:25
Yeah.
1:09:27
You actually are kind of getting some generational, because I think Dick Waring
1:09:30
had already retired by the time I arrived.
1:09:33
Mm-hmm.
1:09:33
Maybe he was just retiring.
1:09:36
Right.
1:09:37
I replaced Fred.
1:09:39
Fred was moving on to
1:09:45
social dynamics and Reflections type things once I was hired.
1:09:54
And Julia and I are kind of more the current folks.
1:09:57
Harmon is more in the middle.
1:09:59
You're getting a bit of it.
1:10:02
A little bit.
1:10:05
I guess maybe with the few minutes left of just curious-I don't have this
1:10:09
on my questionnaire, but something that I've also been curious about
1:10:12
is the LTER Reflections Program.
1:10:14
Has that presence infiltrated the philosophy of science at all?
1:10:19
Has that had an influence?
1:10:23
I'm curious.
1:10:25
Maybe this part of it can be off the record.
1:10:28
Sure.
1:10:29
I'm going to conclude.
